"The story of a man building a giant wooden boat to help his family and the entire animal kingdom survive a terrifying flood is one of the more contentious parts of the Bible. But research by physics students suggests that a structure on the scale of Noah's ark as described in the ancient text could have been built. And what's more, they say it would have been buoyant even with two of every animal on Earth on board. However, while the ark would have stayed afloat they're not sure if every animal would have fit inside. A group of fourth year master's students from the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Leicester calculated that Noah's ark, built to accommodate at least two of every animal species, would have floated using the dimensions ordained in the Bible . In the book of Genesis, Chapter 6:13-22, Noah is commanded to build an ark to survive a flood. - The dimensions for the ark were provided in cubits in the Bible, . an archaic measure based on the distance between the elbow and the tip . of the middle finger. - Noah was commanded to make the boat out of ‘gopher wood’ and in order . to calculate the weight of the empty ark they needed to know the . density of the material the boat was constructed out of, but there . is no modern-day equivalent of gopher wood. - English translations of the Bible refer to . cypress wood instead, so this was the material that the students . used. - In order to . calculate the overall downward force of the ark, the students needed to . know the mass of the animals on board; previous research has suggested . that the average mass of an animal is approximately equal to that of one . sheep, 23.47kg, which was the figure used. - 'Our conclusions were that the ark would support the weight of . 2.15 million sheep without sinking and that should be enough to support . all of the species that were around at the time.' Noah was provided with exact dimensions for the boat which should be 300 cubits long, 50 cubits wide and 30 cubits high. It was built to hold Noah, his family, and at least two of every species of animal for the duration of the flood. Using these dimensions and suitable approximations, University of Leicester physics students Oliver Youle, Katie Raymer, Benjamin Jordan and Thomas Morris tested the instructions and were surprised with their results. Student Thomas Morris, 22, from . Chelmsford, said: 'You don’t think of the Bible necessarily as a . scientifically accurate source of information, so I guess we were quite . surprised when we discovered it would work. 'We’re not proving that it’s . true, but the concept would definitely work.' The students based their calculations on a book by Dr Morris and Dr Whitbomb called The Genesis Flood, which suggested that Noah would have needed to save approximately 35,000 species to repopulate Earth. This enabled the students to conclude that the . dimensions given in the Bible would have allowed Noah to build an ark . that would float with all of the animals on board. They added that it was a separate matter whether all of the animals would fit inside an ark . of these dimensions  – the physics students were simply calculating the . buoyancy of the ark. The students estimated the ark could have held 2.15 million sheep, which was more than strong enough to carry two of every species . Russell Crowe stars in the 2014 film Noah that tackles this biblical tale . The . students presented their findings in a paper for the Journal of Physics . Special Topics, a peer-reviewed student journal run by the University’s . Department of Physics and Astronomy. The student-run journal is designed . to give students practical experience of writing, editing, publishing . and reviewing scientific papers. Course . tutor, Dr Mervyn Roy, a lecturer in the University of Leicester’s . Department of Physics and Astronomy, said: 'The aim of the module is for . the students to learn about peer review and scientific publishing. 'The . students are encouraged to be imaginative with their topics, and find . ways to apply basic physics to the weird, the wonderful and the . everyday.'","University of Leicester students looked into the physics of Noah's ark .

"Oxford University beat Cambridge by a length and a half to win the 159th BNY Mellon Boat Race. The Dark Blues, who won the toss and opted for the Surrey station, made a strong start and finally broke a spirited Cambridge effort just as the river turned towards the finish at Barnes Bridge. Twelve months ago, Oxford lost amid one of the most dramatic and controversial Boat Races in history. Today, the race was clean and tightly fought with no swimming protesters or broken oars.

Oldfield, 36, was released from prison in December after he served seven weeks of a six-month sentence after being found guilty of causing a public nuisance. He has since been contacted by the Metropolitan Police by letter and on Twitter to establish whether he was planning any action this year, saying they were 'keen to facilitate any peaceful protest'. In a statement, the police stressed they were not offering to organise a protest but to afford him the opportunity to exercise his 'lawful rights without causing disruption or danger to themselves or others'.

"The collapse of a 210-year-old building in the heart of the French Quarter is raising warning flags about decay and a lack of rigorous inspections in one of America's oldest and most fragile neighborhoods. No one was injured when the three-story, brick-and-cypress building collapsed in late October, but the episode has thrown into focus an array of problems throughout the nearly 300-year-old Quarter. Among them: structural decay, voracious termites at work on aged wood beams, Louisiana's humid climate, absentee landlords and the stresses of modern life as heavy trucks rattle streets and balconied buildings standing shoulder to shoulder. Perhaps the biggest problem, though, is that no one is charged with making sure the Quarter's 3,000 old buildings are stable. And the city has no in-depth inspection policy tailored to the distinct qualities of its first neighborhood. Scroll down for video . Collapse: Pedestrians watch down the street from where a three-story, brick-and-cypress building collapsed in the historic French Quarter section in New Orleans on October 22 . The single inspector at the Vieux Carre Commission, the city's zoning arm for the Quarter, only has authority to inspect a building's exterior. Citations are routine for gaudy signs and Plexiglas — violations of historical standards — or letting a facade decay. Owners can't be cited for letting a floor sag or allowing mortar to deteriorate to dust on the interiors of their buildings. There are city building and fire inspectors, but they do not do random inspections of old structures. The commission's check-ups amount to 'a visual inspection that occurs from the streets, corners, and any aerial views that we are readily afforded,' said commission chairman Nicholas Musso. 'We do not have the ability to enter a piece of property, or a courtyard, or a rear of a building. It could have been crucial in this particular instance.' Even based on superficial assessments, he's concerned about the condition of some structures: 'We do have a series of buildings that are highly suspect, should we say.' Though many residents and preservationists deem the collapse a wake-up call, longtime Quarter real estate agent Michael Wilkinson thinks the steady rise of wealthier owners ensures most properties are being looked after. Property values have increased by as much as 30 percent in recent years. Accident: The collapse near the heart of the Quarter came at lunchtime on a Tuesday on a block of Royal Street lined with high-end art galleries, boutiques, jewelry stores and restaurants . Scene: Renters in the fallen building, one of the earliest three-story structures in the Quarter, were not at home when it caved in . 'There's a lot of incentive — financial and otherwise — to maintain these properties,' Wilkinson said. 'It's a very wealthy area.' For now, Musso said, the commission hopes property owners will take the initiative and ask inspectors to come in and take a look around. It's not as though there are no interior inspections. Fire department and city inspectors routinely examine commercial properties — the myriad of crowded bars and restaurants that make the Quarter so appealing to the 9.2million tourists who visited New Orleans last year. Building inspectors weigh in whenever major renovations are done to commercial or residential property. And banks require a building to be inspected before backing a purchase. When it comes to inspections and enforcing good maintenance, New Orleans' rules don't differ much from most historic cities and towns, said John Hildreth, a regional vice president for the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Regulations in Boston and New York, for instance, largely match those in New Orleans. Ultimately, that means most of the older structures aren't undergoing regular reviews. The collapse near the heart of the Quarter came at lunchtime on a Tuesday on a block of Royal Street lined with high-end art galleries, boutiques, jewelry stores and restaurants. Renters in the fallen building, one of the earliest three-story structures in the Quarter, were not at home when it caved in. Citation: The owners of the building were cited in 2011 for allowing the facade to decay, but the Vieux Carre Commission has said no single problem caused the collapse. A rear wall of the home following the collapse is seen here . Precarious: In this October 22 photo, a roof hangs from the three-story, brick-and-cypress building that collapsed in the historic French Quarter . 'Incredibly, no one got killed,' said Peter Trapolin, an architect who regularly works in the Quarter and who believes the neighborhood needs a stronger inspection protocol. The owners of the building were cited in 2011 for allowing the facade to decay, but the Vieux Carre Commission has said no single problem caused the collapse. In the past year alone, 302 warnings were issued to owners whose structures were considered, at least on the exterior, to be in dangerously bad condition, according to figures provided by the city. The elderly lady who owned the building operated a small shop where she cut keys and made second-line umbrellas, the decorative parasols common in jazz processions, until about two years ago, said Doc Hawley, an amateur neighborhood historian and a well-known figure around the Quarter for his decades as the captain of the Natchez steamboat. 'I watched them pull out the old timbers,' he said, standing somberly in front of a pile of bricks where the facade once stood. 'They were badly damaged by termites.' Behind the stuccoed walls of the Quarter's old buildings, bricks made hundreds of years ago from Mississippi River mud are crumbling. Add to the stress load hurricanes, heavy tourist traffic, and a constant rumbling of multi-ton trucks carrying beer, food, garbage and heavy equipment. 'These buildings were built for horse and buggies,' Hawley said. 'I lie in bed and I feel my house (in the Quarter) go up and down. The pictures on my walls bounce up and down when the big trucks go by outside.'

"There was a tense moment at the G20 leaders' barbecue on Saturday when U.S. President Barack Obama stood up suddenly. Brisbane chef Ben O'Donoghue, who catered the event, said the organisers had eyes on Mr Obama and they started speaking into their earpieces as soon as he left his table. 'They were saying ""The President's on the move, the President's on the move"",' Mr O'Donoghue told Daily Mail Australia. 'Which then changed to ""Oh, stand down, he's just going back to the buffet"".' Scroll down for video . Brisbane chef Ben O'Donoghue (right) serves Prime Minister Tony Abbott at the Leaders' Retreat Barbecue . The buffet meal was served to world leaders at Queensland Parliament House on Saturday afternoon . Mr O'Donoghue served the most powerful men and women in the world a 'laid back' buffet-style barbecue – though the menu was a great deal fancier than your average Saturday sausage sizzle. Following the Leaders' Retreat at Queensland Parliament House, guests were served a number of dishes including barbecued new season asparagus with peas and goats curd, freshly shucked Moreton Bay rock oysters and smoked and spiced Flinders Island butterflied leg of lamb with yoghurt and eggplant. Mr O'Donoghue, from Billy Cart Kitchen in inner-city Annerley, described the affair as 'pretty cool' 'I was given a brief that Tony Abbott wanted to keep it pretty informal,' Mr O'Donoghue told Daily Mail Australia. 'He wanted to go against regular protocol and make it more relaxing for the leaders.' Mr O'Donoghue, from Billy Cart Kitchen in inner-city Annerley, described the affair as 'pretty cool'. 'I was nervous, the first three people who came up to the buffet were Barack Obama, the Chinese leader and Tony Abbott,' he said . 'Barack Obama came back for seconds which was fantastic. 'It's definitely been the highlight of my career.' Mr O'Donoghue and his team had the plates of seafood, meat and salads laid out on a table and he served the leaders and answered their questions as they grabbed plates and filled them with food. 'They all asked what Moreton Bay bugs are,' he said. 'The Indian Prime Minister was very interested in which dishes had animal products, he's completely vegetarian.' Mr O'Donoghue added that Mr Putin was not treated frostily by the other leaders, and there was more activity on his table than most other people's. 'He spent a lot of time talking with the South Korean President,' Mr O'Donoghue said. Mr O'Donoghue said he had carte blanche to do whatever he wanted with the menu – apart from keeping the meat halal and catering to a few dietary requirements – and he tried to focus on fresh and local ingredients.

"A guitarist who claimed £23,000 in benefits was caught after he was seen on video playing with JLS. Joseph Ross, of Walsall, failed to tell the Department of Work and Pensions that he had found work and earned thousands performing all over the world as well as for The X Factor and Strictly Come Dancing. The father of five, who is due to tour with Cheryl Fernandez-Versini next year, was spotted on Youtube performing with JLS on the Xtra Factor on ITV2 and admitted receiving £22,810 that he wasn't entitled to. Joseph Ross (right) was spotted on a YouTube clip playing alongside JLS on the Xtra Factor despite claiming benefits at the time. The guitarist admitted falsely claiming £23,000 and is attempting to repay the money . Ross started claiming benefits three years ago. Despite being presented the Black Entertainment, Film, Fashion, Television and Arts Excellence Award for his role at the highest level in the music industry for 26 years last year in recognition for his work, he still continued to falsely claim benefits. At a hearing at Walsall Magistrates Court he admitted receiving £22,810 in overpayments that he was not entitled to. He was sentenced to 26 weeks in prison, suspended for a year, and is attempting to pay back the money. So far he has repaid £400. Ross has played alongside R Kelly, Lemar, S Club 7, Gareth Gates, Eternal, MKS, Gabrielle, Joss Stone, Patti LaBelle, Jamelia, Coolio, Notorious BIG, Shola Ama, and Mark Morrison and also claims to have performed at the London 2012 Olympics. On a web profile advertising his services as a musician and band leader he claims to have been hired by the Beckhams, Marvin and Rochelle Humes and current Strictly star Frankie Bridge from The Saturdays. He told the court he had had financial difficulties and was going through a divorce at the time. Ross admitted falsely claiming almost £23,000 in jobseekers allowance despite working as a guitarist . Ross had failed to tell the Department of Work and Pensions that he was now able to work as a guitarist . Ross told magistrates: 'I did sign off when I got the main bulk of work again.' Ian Henery, defending, said Ross had been the victim of bad luck but had recently landed the chance to perform with Cheryl Fernandez-Versini. He said: 'He has five children and was left with debts. And yes, he made a lot of money. But all that money went on paying his band and on the divorce. Ross, 44, received a Black Entertainment, Film, Fashion, Television and Arts Excellence Award last year but continued to claim jobseekers allowance . After he signed off he went on tour with JLS. He has worked with Girls Aloud and made a lot of money working for them for two years. 'He has been offered a tour with Cheryl Fernandez-Versini that will make him £25,000. He has paid back £400 so far. 'He needs to be in a position where he can pay back all the money to taxpayers. 'My client was seen performing with JLS on YouTube. He's had payments from the likes of X Factor, Sony Entertainment, and BBC's Strictly Come dancing. 'He is highly regarded in the industry, but the divorce left him high and dry financially.' Ross admitted an offence of making a false statement to the Department of Work and Pensions, and two offences of failing to notify Walsall Council of a change in his circumstances. The benefit cheat was given a suspended prison sentence for claiming Jobseekers Allowance, council tax and housing benefit he was not meant to have between June 2011 and October 2013. Chairman of the bench Mr Ajmir Dhaliwal jailed him for a total of 26 weeks suspended for 12 months with supervision. Ross must complete the 20-day benefit fraud workbook course, pay £85 costs and £80 victims' surcharge. Martin Ball, from West Midlands Probation Service, told the magistrates: 'He has worked as a musician for a number of years he understands that he should have declared that he was working. 'He says he did discuss this with the Jobcentre at that point before he was interviewed. 'The money he received was being paid to other musicians as part of the band.'","Joseph Ross, of Walsall, has played with Joss Stone and Mark Morrison .

"A teen mom and pastor's daughter has confessed to her family that she does not know who fathered her 11-month-old baby in a new reality show. Olivia Perry, 18, from  Oceano, California, is one of the stars of Preachers' Daughters, which focuses on three young people who struggle to follow their religious parents' strict rules. She gave birth to a little girl called Eden last year after she spent the previous summer experimenting with drugs, 'partying a lot and sleeping around', and as a result she must now get a paternity test. Scroll down for video . Confession time: Teen mom and pastor's daughter Olivia Perry has confessed to her family that she does not know who fathered her 11-month-old baby Eden in a new reality show . In a preview for the show, which airs on the Lifetime network on March 12, the single mother and Cuesta College student tells her siblings: 'So you know how Eden's father is Sean... Well there’s actually a chance that she could be this guy’s name Jay’s.' Her family's shocked reactions are captured on camera. Olivia's model sister Emily, 20, tells viewers: 'It’s definitely hard to hear that my little sister’s slept with more than one guy. She’s my little sister, I don’t want to hear that she’s slept with any guy.' And eldest sister Audrey, 23, an . aspiring missionary, adds: 'My initial reaction was what kind of girl . was she? Was she known as like the slutty girl?' The Perry family: (From left) Cheryl and Mark pictured with their three daughters  Emily, Audrey, Olivia and their granddaughter Eden . Olivia then broaches the subject with her father Mark, the senior leader at the Everyday Church in Oceano, and her mother Cheryl. Unsurprisingly, they are dismayed to learn about their daughter's promiscuous behavior. 'Your teenage daughter gets . pregnant... That fits perfectly with the stereotype, ""The pastor . can’t even control his own family""' 'I mean how many guys are we talking about?' Mr Perry asks, before telling Olivia: 'There needs to be a paternity test. Let's pray for you.' Olivia said that she contemplated having an abortion after discovering that she was pregnant aged 17. 'Being a preacher's daughter is hard. It feels like you can’t really mess up,' she says. But her father told her that she would be 'killing' his granddaughter, and so she kept the baby. Mr Perry details in the trailer how he struggled to come to terms with the pregnancy. Under pressure: Olivia said that she contemplated having an abortion on discovering she was pregnant . In the spotlight: Baby Eden - Olivia's 11-month-old daughter - is the youngest star of Lifetime's new docu-series Preachers' Daughters . 'As a pastor your teenage daughter gets pregnant. That fits perfectly with the stereotype; ""Oh yeah the pastor can’t even control his own family,""' he says. The father-of-three says he took part in the reality show to . help dispel misconceptions about the lives of religious leaders and their . families, including the idea that pastors behave one way in public and . another way behind closed doors. 'We didn’t say yes to the show because we wanted to be on TV. We said yes because we wanted to tell our story. 'We’ll be able to show our weaknesses and hopefully our strengths... It’s not really a religious show. It’s a human show. It’s a family show,' he told The Tribune. Strong beliefs: Olivia's father, Mark, is the senior leader at the Everyday Church in Oceano . Religious upbringing: Olivia admits that 'being a preacher's daughter is hard' His wife, Cheryl, who oversees Everyday Church events and community outreach as its 'connect pastor', added: 'Our church knows who we are. They know . the difficulties we face.' Cheryl and Mark met in 1985 at a church in San Luis Obispo, California. They went on to establish a church in the mid west, before returning to the Central Coast in 2002 to found a regional church and apostolic center. They launched the Everyday Church, a non-denominational, Christian place of worship, on Easter Sunday in 2004. Their three children were raised to respect Christian values. Their youngest daughter, Olivia, who has now put her partying days to bed, says that her faith has helped her and she hopes that her TV appearance will help other teen moms. Rebellious: Olivia Perry (left, pictured with a friend) said that she discovered she was pregnant after spending a summer partying, experimenting with drugs and sleeping around . 'People will be able to see that there is hope in hopeless situations,' she said. The Perry family were followed for five weeks last October and November when Olivia's baby daughter was just six months old. In addition to Perrys the series follows  Taylor Coleman, 18, from Lockport, Illinois, whose father, Ken, is a Pentecostal Church pastor. Taylor reveals in one of the previews that she would like to become a porn star. The series was produced by Thinkfactory Media, the company behind A&E reality show Gene Simmons Family Jewels and the History mini series Hatfields & McCoys.

"For humans, sunscreen is a saviour, protecting us from harmful UV rays which can cause cancer. But the protective lotion could also be responsible for killing countless sea creatures, scientists have warned. A new study claims that when certain . sunscreen ingredients wash off skin and into the sea, they can become . toxic to some of the ocean’s tiniest inhabitants - phytoplankton. A new study claims that sunscreen ingredients such as titanium dioxide and zinc oxide react in the sunlight and form toxic compounds that wash off the skin into the sea. Compounds such as hydrogen peroxide can harm phytoplankton - tiny marine organisms. This chemical equation shows how titanium dioxide (TiO2) eventually produces hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) when it is exposed to solar radiation . Titanium . dioxide and zinc oxide nanoparticles, which are common sunscreen . ingredients, react with ultraviolet light from the sun and form new . compounds, such as hydrogen peroxide. High . amounts of hydrogen peroxide can harm phytoplankton - the microscopic . algae that feed everything from small fish to shrimp to whales. The research was conducted by scientists from the Universities of the . Balearic Islands and Río San Pedro, in Spain. To . investigate the impact that beachgoers could be having on the . environment, they went to Majorca’s Palmira beach on the Mediterranean. There, they were among about 10,000 beachgoers - a small portion of the more than . 200 million tourists that flock to Mediterranean shores every year. Based . on lab tests, seawater sampling and tourism data, the researchers . concluded that titanium dioxide from sunscreen was largely responsible . for a dramatic summertime spike in hydrogen peroxide levels in coastal . waters - with potentially dangerous consequences for aquatic life. If plankton are killed, the impact could be huge, because they are the main food source for larger marine animals, according to the study, which was published in the ACS journal Environmental Science & Technology. Antonio Tovar-Sanchez and David Sánchez-Quiles agree that sunscreen is the best way to protect skin from the sun’s rays if staying inside is not an option. But they say that when sunbathers venture into the sea to cool off, some of their sunscreen washes off into the water. High amounts of hydrogen peroxide can harm phytoplankton - the microscopic algae that feed everything from small fish to shrimp to whales. A SEM image of two types of phytoplankton is pictured . Wearing sun cream is not a reliable way to prevent getting skin cancer, scientists warned in June. A groundbreaking study into the way UV radiation attacks the skin has revealed that long-lasting damage is not stopped by sunscreen. While an SPF cream can stop sunburn and the short-term effects of sunbathing, it allows enough rays through to cause potentially fatal disease in the long term. Anyone who spends more than a short time in the sun should make sure they are covered up and should not rely on sunscreen alone, experts warned. Scientists at Manchester University and London’s Institute of Cancer Research carried out the world’s first molecular study into the way malignant melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, is caused. Their paper, published in the journal Nature, revealed that even highest grade SPF 50 suncream allows sufficient UV radiation through to damage the DNA in the skin’s pigment cells. Malignant melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in the UK, with more than 13,000 people diagnosed with the disease every year. The scientists found that sunscreen could not stop solar radiation causing a mutation in the skin’s ‘guardian gene’ which produces proteins that protect against UV. With the gene damaged, the skin is vulnerable to further damage from the sun and more likely to develop a tumour.","Spanish scientists looked at the environmental impact of sunscreen .

"The Obama administration has turned on the former Army comrades of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, managing the aftermath of his release in part by trashing their accounts of his disappearance in Afghanistan nearly five years ago. 'I've had a few aides describe it to me as ""we didn't know that they were going to swift-boat Bergdahl"",' NBC News Chief White House Correspondent Chuck Todd told Today show host Matt Lauer on Wednesday. Asked later on Twitter if the Obama administration officials used those exact words – 'swift-boat' – Todd tweeted: 'I didn't make it up.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . 'Swift-boated'? Video released by the Taliban and obtained from the 'Voice of Jihad' website shows Bergdahl preparing to be handed over to U.S. Special Forces on Saturday; White House aides are now attacking his former comrades for calling him a wartime deserter . 'Go Google it on the web': State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf questioned Tuesday whether Bergdahl deserted his post, advising reporters to turn to Google for conflicting accounts . In 2004 John Kerry's presidential campaign failed to swat away claims from his former naval comrades, 'Swift Boat Veterans for Truth,' that he exaggerated his combat record and was a failed leader . The 'swift-boat' line is reference to Secretary of State John Kerry's failed 2004 presidential campaign, in which a group of his former Vietnam war naval shipmates publicly and loudly questioned his leadership abilities and his record of service, in a series of television ads. 'So there’s some fighting words there,' Todd said. Seven former Bergdahl platoon-mates has made the rounds in major media since Monday, with overlapping groups speaking to MailOnline, Fox News, CNN, the Wall Street Journal and other news outlets. 'I'm positive that he's a deserter, and that it was all premeditated,' said Gerald Sutton, a 31-year-old Michigan college student who told MailOnline that he was 'a good friend' of Bergdahl when they were deployed to the Middle East together. 'This soldier knew what he was doing,' added Cody Full, 25, who also served in Bergdahl's unit. 'He left us. He willingly and premeditatedly deserted his comrades.' 'And he put his team, his squad, his platoon, his company, and thousands of other American soldiers in Afghanistan at a very high risk trying to find him.' It's statements like those that the White House appears eager to discredit as it scrambles to quell concerns – both among the general public and members of Congress – about a deal to trade five high-ranking Taliban terrorists for Bergdahl's safe return on Saturday. A State Department deputy spokeswoman joined in the fray Tuesday, suggesting that the Idaho native's onetime brothers-in-arms aren't telling the whole story. SWIFT BOAT: John Kerry (L) was photographed in 1969 with William Rood (R) at the Swift boat base at An Thoi, Vietnam; In 2004 as Kerry ran for president, Rood challenged the future secretary of state's account of the battle for which he won the silver star . Deserter? The Taliban released a propaganda video showing US soldier Bowe Bergdahl in 2010, a year after he left his post in a rural area of eastern Afghanistan . 'We don’t know the facts about what happened yet on that day,' said Marie Harf during a daily press briefing, referring to the June 2009 night when Bergdahl was last seen with his unit. 'There are conflicting reports out there about this,' she said. 'Are there?' asked a Fox News Channel producer. 'There are. Go Google it on the web and you’ll find a ton of conflicting reports,' Harf replied. 'The fact is we’re still establishing a fact pattern about what happened, how he ended up in Taliban captivity.' 'I think people need to be really careful about believing every second or third-hand report out there,' she added – in a direct slam on Full, Sutton and the other eyewitnesses who have stepped forward. Challenged about 'his squad mates who served with him overseas said he walked off the [base], Harf took exception and insisted that 'there’s a lot of rumor and ""telephone"" game that’s being played here about what happened.' 'He’s been in captivity,' she scolded. 'I think he’s probably the person who knows best what happened on that night.' 'But – well, I think that his squad mates have the best indication what happened that night,' the producer responded. 'I don’t think that that’s the case,' came Harf's retort. Three more members of Bergdahl's platoon spoke to the Associated Press on Wednesday, saying they, too, believe he is a wartime U.S. Army deserter. Bergdahl, the unit's medic recalled thinking at the time, was 'that one guy that wanted to disappear, and now he's gotten his wish.' The now-rescued sergeant 'willfully deserted his post,' he said, 'and he needs to be held accountable for that.'","Obama administration officials told an NBC correspondent that Bergdahl's platoon-mates were 'swift-boating' him .

"A fierce supermarket price war has made it possible to put a Christmas turkey with all the trimmings on the table this year for just £2.66 per person. Shopping around for the best deals among the ten biggest chains could deliver a meal that costs £21.31 for a family of eight – 53p less than last year. If you opt to go to only one outlet, then Iceland wins on cost. Their basket came in at £27.83 with Lidl second at £28.13, Morrisons third at £29.12 and Aldi costing £32.06. Scroll down for video . Christmas dinner with all the trimmings could cost as little as £2.66 a person after a fierce supermarket price war . The rise of the discount chains has dragged mainstream stores into a price war that has delivered real savings on everyday essentials, such as milk, bread and eggs. However, the battle has now been spread to the most important meal of the year and includes fresh vegetables, Christmas pudding and brandy butter. The price comparison was made by the Good Housekeeping Institute which has been monitoring prices since 2009 when the cheapest selection of ingredients came in at £3 per head, or £24. Consumer director at Good Housekeeping, Caroline Bloor, said: ‘It’s a constant struggle for many to keep family food bills under control, but the current battle between the traditional supermarkets and the discounters is pulling prices down for everyone – and will continue to do so. ‘Even at the most expensive supermarkets there are still bargains to be found, for example Waitrose’s Christmas cake is 49p cheaper than Aldi’s and the cost of potatoes and carrots is broadly the same across all retailers. ‘It’s a real time of change, and we’ll be monitoring it closely to see who’s really focused on the customer.’ This year's cheapest turkey which is big enough to feed eight can be bought at Lidl for £9.99 (picture from Lidl Christmas advert) It said the cheapest turkey that is big enough to feed eight was the frozen Braemoor self-basting bird from Lidl, which was £9.99 at the time the survey was done. The firm’s website now offers a small frozen Braemoor turkey at £8.99, which is up to 4kg, while a medium bird of up to 5.4kg is £10.99. The next biggest expense was a family size Christmas cake which came in at £3 from Iceland for a large iced fruit bar of 800g. While Iceland is known predominantly for its frozen food, it also sells the normal range of fresh produce and Christmas products. The chain is making a determined attempt to attract more middle Britain shoppers with some more upmarket special deals, such as a whole cooked lobster for just £5 . The company’s Deluxe Mince Pies at £1.50 for a pack were recently named the best on the high street, even beating products costing more than eight times as much from Fortnum & Mason and Harrods. The pies were praised for being ‘generously filled with sweet, fruity mincemeat’, while the pastry was described as buttery and crumbly. Iceland's mince pies, which beat Harrods and Fortnum & Mason's efforts in a taste test, cost just £1.50 . Aldi supplied the cheapest sprouts at 49p for 750g, while its carrots were best value at 49p for 1.2kg. Lidl and Aldi had the cheapest Brandy butter at £1.49 for 200g. Tesco was best for parsnips at 90p for 750g and its Everyday Value cranberry sauce was just 50p for 185g. The Co-op was best for potatoes at £1.50 for a 1.5kg bag of Maris Piper. The Sainsbury’s Basics range provided two 454g Christmas puddings for £2 and eight puff pastry mince pies at 65p for a pack of eight. The price battle for customers has also delivered savings at the quality end of the Christmas food table. The figure for Marks & Spencer is down from £51.29 to £47.04, while Waitrose is down from £53.15 to £41.05. Given the cut-throat nature of the battle for festive food sales, there is every chance that prices will change – and fall further – through special promotions in the coming weeks.","Christmas dinner with all the trimmings can be bought for just £2.66 each .

"A 60mph waterspout hit Tampa, Florida, today, and was caught on camera by a tourist. Robert Siegel, who is a spotter for the National Weather Service, took the picture while on vacation in the area. It appeared just off northern Hillsborough Bay at 11.12am. 'Breath of God': Robert Siegel captured the strange weather phenomenon on camera just off the coast of Tampa today . Water tornado: Minor damage was caused along the waterfront and on Harbours Island in the water tornado which hit in Tampa this morning . Mr Siegel, of Colorado, snapped the photo as people fled the incoming storm. 'I opened the window, I opened the shades up and I see there is heavy wind and for literally about six or seven seconds, it was like the breath of God came down,' he said. According to Yahoo News the water tornado hit the Westin Hotel and traveled down a channel between the Tampa Bay Times Forum and the Florida Aquarium. It didn't cause any injuries but damaged roofing and downed light poles and trees. Another onlooker, restaurant owner Rachel Prophet, said the waterspout made a 'howling noise' and smashed her restaurant awning through a window above her. Damaged: Parts of buildings were ripped off in the storm in Tampa this morning but no one was injured . Damage: Part of the roof of the Westin Hotel was ripped off during the waterspout. Business owners on the coastline by Harbour Island said it sounded like a freight train . 'I was sitting down eating breakfast, and the wind just started to blow,' she told Tampa Bay Online. 'It was a howling noise, a loud piercing noise. All the trees outside were just whipping, whipping, whipping.' 'I was a little shaken up,' Prophet said. 'I’m not going to lie. I was scared.' Keith Weitzmann, a cook at the restaurant, said it sounded 'like a freight . train'. Bus driver Robert Hagemann told the website he was about to drop off passengers at the Florida Aquarium when the waterspout struck. 'It rocked the bus. It was a short duration, but it was powerful. All kinds of debris were flying around,' he said.

"Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been struggling to avoid one very hot topic at Brisbane's G20 summit but it seems it was inevitable. With Sunday's temperature scorching to over 40, climate change has been a very topical conversation among world leaders, who have probed the Aussie PM in a number of 'difficult discussions'. With the G20 nations turning up the heat on the host and Australian PM for some 'real action' on the issue, the final address confirmed the G20 nations have strongly backed action on climate change. 'We support strong and effective action to address climate change,' the official communique said on Sunday. Scroll down for video . Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott (pictured) addressed the G20 and says the nations strongly back action on climate change . Climate change wasn't on the formal agenda prepared by the Australian presidency, but supportive statements by US President Barack Obama (pictured) this weekend ensured its inclusion in the final statement . Climate change wasn't on the formal agenda prepared by the Australian presidency, but supportive statements by US President Barack Obama this weekend ensured its inclusion in the final statement. The leaders agreed their future actions will support sustainable development, economic growth and certainty for business and investment. The G20 will work together to adopt a protocol under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to present at the Paris climate conference in 2015. 'We encourage parties that are ready to communicate their intended nationally determined contributions well in advance,' they said. 'We reaffirm our support for mobilising finance for adaptation and mitigation, such as the Green Climate Fund.' The UN-backed fund was set up to help poor countries deal with the impacts of climate change, such as rising sea levels and severe weather events.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel (pictured right) chats with British Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured centre) and US President Barack Obama (pictured left) during the USA-EU meeting at the G20 summit in Brisbane . The US this weekend committed $US3 billion to the fund, and Japan $US1.5 billion. Following his address to the G20, Mr Abbott was questioned about Australia's commitment to climate change. 'This government has just passed through the parliament legislation to put into effect our emission reduction fund, a $2.5 billion fund,' said Mr Abbott. 'We aren't just talking about taking action about climate change, we are cracking on with the job.' 'Australia is a high performer when it comes to actually delving on real action when it comes to tackling climate change.' 'We'll be making further decisions at the right time. What we want to do is to take effective action against climate change which is consistent with strong economic growth.' On Saturday US president Barack Obama said that no country was immune to the effects of climate change and that everyone must play a role in fighting the global phenomena. 'I want my daughters to be able to come back and I want them to be able to bring their daughters or sons to visit,' he told an audience at the University of Queensland to loud applause.

'I want that there 50 years from now.' Meanwhile, under pressure to jolt the stubbornly lethargic world economy back to life, leaders of G-20 nations finalised a plan to boost global GDP by more than $2 trillion over five years by investing in infrastructure and increasing trade. The communique also revealed that leaders plan to jump start growth in part by creating a global infrastructure hub and it would help match potential investors with projects. They also aim to reduce the gap between male and female participation in the workforce by 25 percent by 2025. Tony Abbott said countries will hold each other to account by monitoring implementation of their commitments to boost growth. The International Monetary Fund and OECD will also play a role in monitoring progress and estimating the economic benefits. U.S. President Barack Obama (pictured right) and France's President Francois Hollande (pictured left) during a meeting with European leaders at G20 Summit to discuss transatlantic trade and the situation in Ukraine . Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott (pictured) has been unable to avoid talking about climate change confirming the G20 nations will work together to adopt a protocol under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to present at the Paris climate conference in 2015 . The G-20 communique says if the $2 trillion initiative is fully implemented it would lift global GDP by 2.1 percent above expected levels by 2018 and create millions of jobs. Abbott said countries have agreed more than 800 measures to spur the global economy, which the IMF says is facing a 'new mediocre.' 'The G-20 has delivered real, practical outcomes and, because of the efforts that the G-20 has made, this year, culminating in the last 48 hours, people right around the world are going to be better off,' Abbott said. But with international agencies downgrading their global growth forecasts in recent months, the G-20 - which represents around 85 percent of the global economy - faces an uphill struggle to implement its plan. Growth in China and Japan has weakened and Europe is teetering on the brink of a recession. Abbott said leaders unanimously agreed that expanding global trade would directly benefit countries and people around the world. 'Trade is a key driver of growth, perhaps the key driver of growth and we're focused on domestic reforms to facilitate trade as well as the importance of a strong global trading system,' Abbott said.","G20 nations confirmed they have strongly backed action on climate change .

"To most people a dirty windscreen means it’s time to take your car for a wash but for one man in Texas it’s an excuse to create a piece of art. Scott Wade works as a graphic user interface designer, but his time is increasingly spent creating his own inimitable works of art on the back windows of vehicles. Wade has made a name for himself as the world’s premier dirty car artist and in recent years his unusual talent has taken him around the world. Scroll down for video . Scott Wade from Texas has made a name for himself as the world’s premier dirty car artist and here he poses with his drawing of Progressive Insurance's Flo and a 'FLOwer Power' motif . Wade created this detailed drawing for a proposed Ford Escape ad campaign and he is regularly hired by ad agencies, PR firms and event management companies to  create work . The inspiration behind his craft dates back more than 20 years to when he lived at the end of a long dirt road in Central Texas. According to Wade, frequent trips up and down the lane caused the family cars to become quite dirty which prompted him to casually doodle and draw faces on the windows. ‘My father was a great amateur cartoonist and I must have picked that up from him, because my natural tendency was always to draw funny faces,’ he writes on his website. As time progressed he started to experiment with his drawing technique and found that he could use the pads of his fingers to brush very lightly to get grey tones. According to Wade, frequent trips up and down the lane caused the family cars to become quite dirty which prompted him to casually doodle and draw faces on the windows . American Gothic: Wade recreates the famous painting by American master Grant Wood . Wade was commissioned to create this series of portraits of the original cast of the hit 80s TV show Dallas for a 30th anniversary gala at Southfork Ranch and afterwards the actors even signed it . Next he progressed to using paintbrushes and nowadays he use a rubber ‘paint-shaper’ tool and assorted brushes. Wade enjoys reproducing famous paintings by the old masters on backs of hatchbacks, trucks, and SUVs, but he is also willing to try and reproduce almost anything. One of his most recent favorites was to draw Progressive Insurance’s Flo with a ‘FLOwer Power’ motif on the back of a Dodge Grand Caravan. ‘To me it’s not so much the subject, but the beauty of the medium that attracts me,’ he explained. Depending on the complexity of the image, the art works can take just a few minutes or as long as six hours to complete. On average he says he spends between an hour and a half and three hours on each drawing. The Marx Brothers:  This was created for a street art festival in Santa Clarita, California . Wade was asked to reproduce a likeness of Pippa Middleton's famous bottom from her sister Kate's royal wedding to Prince William . His drawings certainly attract plenty of attention and he says that he and his family regularly get stopped by people who want to have their picture taken with his art work. 'One time a guy in a pickup truck blocked me in as I was leaving the grocery store parking lot. 'He apologized, but asked me to stay there while his daughter went back in the store to buy a disposable camera,' he recalls. Initially his art work attracted local attention, but as news of his talent has spread so too have the offers to travel and draw elsewhere. Wade has now done art shows, festivals, auto shows in places as far flung as London, Istanbul, Lisbon, Mexico City, Vancouver and Toronto, as well as all over the U.S. Laurel & Hardy: Wade claims that days and days of accumulated dirt make for the best canvases, but he’s also perfected a routine that prepares a car for art in about 10 minutes . Einstein: Wade claims that days and days of accumulated dirt make for the best canvases, but he’s also perfected a routine that prepares a car for art in about 10 minutes .

Wade claims that days and days of accumulated dirt make for the best canvases, but he’s also perfected a routine that prepares a car for art in about 10 minutes. 'I couldn’t do the many events I do each year without having developed the ""artificial canvas,"" as I call it,' explained Wade. 'When I was mulling over how to dirty up a window, a friend told me about Fuller’s Earth, used in the film industry. Buying bags of it is sure easier than scooping dirt off the road and sifting it!'

"A leading Islamic community leader has revealed two of the four Sydney brothers who have gone to Syria to fight for the Islamic State are 'obese' weighing in at over 140kg amid fears they might be snubbed by fellow terrorists if they eat all their rations. Dr Jamal Rifi, said the boys would not make good foot soldiers for the terror group, instead he believes they will be used for propaganda videos. The boy's from western Sydney, who all lived at home with their parents, sent their shocked mother a one line text message saying they had arrived safely in Syria, she thought it was a cruel joke. Scroll down for video . More Australians have slipped through the cracks and fled overseas to join the fight with Islamic State . The message read: 'We made it to Bilad al-Sham, we will see you in Paradise.' One of the boys who works had initially told the mother that he won dour tickets to Thailand and he was going to take his brothers with him. Dr Rifi told radio station 2UE: 'The family is distraught, their main concern is to initiate contact, the concern are not concerned how they were radicalised but that they want them to come back. 'We are hoping the fact that because two of them are quite obese they will not good foot soldiers, they are over 140 kg. Dr Jamal Rifi said he was in daily contact with the family,he revealed two of the brothers are over 140kg and would not make good foot soldiers for IS . 'People are going to realise what are we going to do with them? Are they going to eat al the food and you can't even run on the field.' Dr Rifi said the family was trying to get messages to the boys but they had not responded and had probably had their mobile phones confiscated by IS. He explained the family had given all the information to the authorities who were trying to 'put the pieces of the puzzle together'. The boy's mother is of Lebanese descent and their father is a taxi driver, they also have another brother and sister living at home. Dr Rifi added they were 'simple boys' who could not organise trip properly, he revealed the boys had missed the first flight they had booked and had to re-book one for the next day. He said: 'They have no life experience. They (the parents) had no idea what their kids were planning such a move, these are ordinary kids who live at home, they showed no sign of radicalisation.' The fifth son went to meet the flight that was coming in from Thailand on Saturday, hoping it was a joke. Dr Rizi said the family had alerted the authorities to the boy's departure and it was now up to them to 'put the pieces of the puzzle together'. It emerged on Saturday authorities had tracked the brothers - who lived in south-west Sydney - as far as Turkey and alerted the family last week. But it was believed they had crossed the border and ended up in Bilad al-Sham - a region in Syria. Family friend and Muslim community leader Dr Jamal Rifi told AAP the family had thought the message was a joke. 'The family didn't know what to make of it... They got scared and deleted the SMS,' Dr Rifi said. The mother even went to Sydney airport the next day to pick up her sons who were meant to have been on a holiday in Thailand, but they never arrived. The sons, 17, 23, 25 and 28, are believed to be the latest group of young Australians who have joined IS militants in Syria. The mother has pleaded with them to come home, 9News reported. 'My sons, you are dear to us,' she said in a statement. 'You are good at heart. You have done nothing wrong. 'We want you back. I can't stop crying day and night. We love you all.' Authorities argue they need more tools to monitor suspects and prevent them from being radicalised . It is understood the 17-year-old was studying for his HSC at a public high school and the older brothers had stable jobs before they left. Unlike some before them, the siblings were 'clean-skins' and had not been on any watch-lists that would have alerted immigration controls. Dr Rifi said the family had no inclination the boys were at risk of joining IS. 'The boys are simple boys,' he said. 'They are religiously involved but not hardline or radical.' Dr Rifi said social media was playing a big role in the recruitment of these young Sydney men but there had to be someone manipulating the situation face-to-face. '... and providing contact information through the networks and how to cross the border,' he said. Many foreign fighters have already left the country including Mohamed Elomar (pictured) The four boys, one of whom still attended school, lived at home with their teenage sister, according The Sunday Telegraph. Their family home have been searched by police. Earlier this week on Thursday, Australian Federal Police commissioner Neil Gaughan told a parliamentary committee that the group of four that managed to leave the country this week were 'not on anyone's radar', The Guardian reported. 'We got wind of it after the fact, but the fact is there are still people travelling,' said Gaughan, the national manager of counter-terrorism for the Australian Federal Police,' he said. Authorities were alerted last Saturday when the family contacted a member of a local community after they failed to hear from their boys since they fled the country, News Corp reported. On Saturday, Immigration Minister Scott Morrison confirmed the family was seeking his help but unfortunately, it was too late. Khaled Sharrouf is also fighting with IS militants in the Middle East, and made headlines when he posted a photo of his young son brandishing a severed head . 'Australia has lost yet another four young kids. This is why we are so adamant in trying to prevent people leaving to join these foreign fighters', Mr Morrison told The Daily Telegraph. It follows the disappearance of 'ginger' jihadist Abdullah Elmir from his Bankstown home in Sydney's south-west in June and made his way to the Middle East. The 17-year-old gained notoriety when he declared that ISIS will not stop their murderous campaign 'until the black flag is flying high in every single land' in the YouTube video. According to The Daily Telegraph, counter terrorism officers have been deployed to all Australian international airports. This comes just days ahead of the G20 summit to be held in Brisbane, which will be attended by a large number of world leaders. Australian Federal Police commissioner Neil Gaughan speaking at the investigation into new legislation in Canberra on Thursday . Police commissioner Neil Gaughan also told the committee he believed federal police officers needed greater controls urgently, so they were better able to track the movements and interactions of suspects. 'But the fact is there’s still people travelling and regardless of what we’re doing, we’re not stopping that so we need some other tools,' he said, according to the Telegraph. Though he did not reveal from where or to what destination the group travelled, Gaughan said officers are now virtually powerless to stop them unless they resurface elsewhere. 'Unfortunately, once they get into Syria or into Iraq, there is nothing the AFP can do except wait for them to basically pop their head up somewhere on the way back.' Gaughan was speaking at an investigation into new legislation which aims to give security agencies power to issue control orders on people who are enabling or supporting terrorism. He also revealed that authorities were struggling to keep up with the sheer number of people being radicalised in such a short time - often less than six months. Authorities said the ability to put restrictions on who suspects can communicate with and where they can go would allow them to greatly reduce the change of an attack on home soil. There are now more than 60 Australians known to be fighting in foreign conflicts.","Four brothers from Sydney's south-west left Australia to fight in Syria .

"A ship which has suffered a second outbreak of the Norovirus in little over six months is due to set sail on another cruise later today after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has conducted tests and the vessel has undergone a thorough disinfecting. The Crown Princess is due to arrive in California on Sunday carrying 172 people who have fallen ill with the highly contagious virus during their nearly month-long trip. The ship has more than 4,100 people on board and will be met by CDC staff upon arrival in San Pedro. CDC staff will conduct testing and evaluate the response. The Crown Princess, operated by Princess Cruises, has suffered a second outbreak of the Norovirus in little over six months but is still due to set sail on another cruise this evening after a thorough cleaning . Over the last few days, crew members said an increased number of gastrointestinal illnesses caused by Norovirus were reported. Princess Cruises has ‘enacted our stringent disinfecting protocols’ developed in consultation with the CDC and will do a deep cleaning of the ship and terminal in Los Angeles before departing on Sunday night for a weeklong cruise through the Mexican Riviera, said spokeswoman Susan Lomax. The 28-day cruise visited Hawaii and Tahiti. In April, 129 people on the same ship contracted Norovirus during a seven-day cruise off the California coast. Lomax said that the ship went through the same stringent disinfecting process after it docked. In April, 129 people on the same ship contracted Norovirus during a seven-day cruise off the California coast . ‘As it is the cold and flu season, when the stomach flu circulates on land, we encourage all of our guests to be diligent in following the widely accepted practices of frequent hand washing with soap and water and the use of hand sanitizers,’ Lomax said. Norovirus is very contagious and can be transmitted from an infected person, contaminated food or water, or by touching contaminated surfaces. Symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, fever and body aches. According to the CDC, most people recover within three days. In the month of January alone, the CDC reported that there were in excess of 600 cases of Norovirus on cruise ships in the Caribbean.","The Crown Princess, operated by Princess Cruises, has suffered a second outbreak of the Norovirus in little over six months .

"The massive security operation for the Brisbane G20 has set a new benchmark for future international events, police say. There was no hint of the kind of violent protests that marred previous G20 summits in Toronto and London when world leaders gathered this weekend. And concerns about potential terrorist attacks or large scale cyber attacks proved unfounded. Scroll down for video . Queensland police, who were ready for any potential terror attacks, hope their security measures will set a new worldwide 'benchmark' Just 27 people were excluded from G20 security zones and 14 were arrested in the lead up to and during the summit, while protests were carried out across Brisbane's CBD (pictured) There were few arrests, despite dozens of protests playing out on the sidelines of the event. About 6,000 police patrolled the city, with authorities denying it was a case of overkill with so many internationally protected leaders present at once. But they have also credited the tolerant approach officers took with keeping any heat out of the protests, despite the weekend's baking temperatures. Just 27 people were excluded from G20 security zones and 14 were arrested in the lead up to and during the summit. Most face minor charges such as failing to state their name and address. A man was detained at 8.30am on Sunday outside the hotel was where U.S. President Barack Obama was staying during the G20 Summit . It follows a man being questioned at the back of the Marriott Hotel in Brisbane as the president was leaving . Queensland police deputy commissioner Ross Barnett said the potential for serious incidents justified the scale of the police presence. 'An event like this is obviously a high-value terrorist threat,' he told reporters as the summit wrapped up on Sunday. 'There was no overkill in terms of the security planning and preparation.' Mr Barnett said the operation's success meant the Brisbane G20 would be remembered for all the right reasons. 'The enduring legacy about Brisbane will not be anything about the security operation. It won't be burning police cars and damage,' he said. Mr Obama waves from his car as he leaves the Marriott Hotel in Brisbane, at the same time the young man was detained just metres away . Police Commissioner Ian Stewart said he hoped the operation would become a benchmark for international events, including the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games. He said he expected Turkish security teams would contact him to discuss the 2015 G20 summit there. 'It's worked so well I hope others will look at it, just like we looked at what went wrong in other places around the world,' Mr Stewart said, referring to violent protests in 2010 in Toronto. There were fewer protests on the last day of the summit than on Saturday, but they still had the potential to flare up given that they took place in temperatures nearing 40 degrees Celsius. It was a struggle for police as well, with Mr Barnett saying snipers atop city rooftops endured 'brutal' temperatures as high as 63 degrees Celsius. The most recent security incident during the G20 involved a man who was detained at the back of a Brisbane hotel by police, mere moments after U.S. President Barack Obama left the building on Sunday. Police searched through the young man's two suitcases and photographed the items, including foreign currency in a plastic bag (pictured) It is understood the  man was detained from 8.30am until 11am on Sunday morning . The man was forced to remain at scene after being stopped at the rear of the Marriott Hotel. He was questioned by an officer and forced to remove his shoes while a swarm of police searched through his belongings. The man, who appears to be in his twenties, was stopped at 8.30am with two suitcases. Various items were photographed, which appeared to include paper and cardboard. Police were also seen holding up a plastic bag which contained foreign currency. There are reports that a second man was also reportedly detained at the scene and his belongings were searched. It's claimed they were both allowed to leave at around 11am. Mr Obama is staying at the hotel during the G20 Summit and had left on Sunday morning for a trilateral meeting with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The US President has been basing himself in the $2,500 a night Presidential Suite at the Marriott Hotel on Queen Street. Ahead of his visit, US security officials stripped down an entire floor surrounding the presidential suite to ensure Obama was not being spied upon. Mirrors and beds were removed from these rooms, and the suite itself was combed and verified as being safe for Obama to engage in private phone calls. His room is on the top floor, with a king size bed and 131 square metres of room to play with, as well as panoramic views of Brisbane River. The building comprises of 28 floors of 263 rooms, four of which are suites. There are also 10 meeting rooms, 7,750 sq ft of total meeting space.","Only 27 people were excluded from security zones and 14 were arrested .

"Zarko Udovicic, a footballer who was threatened at gunpoint after missing a crucial penalty during a game for Novi Pazar FC in Serbia . A Serbian footballer was threatened by a fan who forced his way into a dressing room  and held a gun to his head because he missed a penalty during a match. Zarko Udovicic handed in an immediate transfer request after several men, who were furious with the defender for missing the spot kick in the 85th minute of a game against Rad FC in Belgrade, burst into Novi Pazar FC's training ground. The incident happened two days after the match when the fans kicked down a door and grabbed the player, pointing a gun at him and threatening to kill him for what he had done. As soon as he was released, the 27-year-old announced he had asked for his contract to be terminated and handed in a transfer request. The president of the football players union in Serbia Mirko Poledica confirmed the incident saying: 'I don't want anyone to think that this behaviour is typical of fans here, this was an isolated incident and they were hooligans who will be caught and punished. 'A complaint has already been made to police after they levelled the gun at his head and threatened to kill him.' He also called on the Serbian Football Association and the Serbian League to take action. Mr Poledica added: 'What worries me is that there is no reaction from the football association. They remain quiet. 'They must do something to guarantee the safety of the players. But they don't. Next time a player could be murdered. 'The only positive thing from this situation, is that our Deputy Prime Minister (Rasim Ljajic) has spoken out and acknowledged the serious problems we are facing. In the match against Rad FC, the defender stepped up to take a penalty in the 85th minute but sent his effort over the bar . After missing, the player was seen walking away with his head hanging as a rival player waves his fists in his face in celebration . 'In Serbia, no fan has ever been prosecuted or convicted after violent behaviour against a football player. That's why players are afraid. 'Each day they hope that there will be nobody knocking on their door to beat them up, that there will be no person setting their car on fire, or that there will be no hooligan putting a gun to their head.' A video of the penalty shows Mr Udovicic player walking away after missing a goal with his head hanging, as a rival player runs alongside him celebrating the miss by waving his fist in celebration in the unfortunate player's face.","Zarko Udovicic missed a crucial penalty while playing for Novi Pazar FC .

"Ashley McKenzie's judo career began with a playground fight over a stolen Pokemon card and reached its pinnacle when he became Commonwealth champion on Thursday night, leading an English gold rush. McKenzie embraces his ‘Bad Boy’ nickname. He has been banned from the sport several times for misbehaving, spent time in a young offenders’ institute and now plans to open a school for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, the condition he honed to become a champion. As a child he was diagnosed with asthma, eczema, ADHD and obsessive compulsive disorder. He had two hearing aids fitted and surgery to mend a hole in his heart.

"After David Hasselhoff he's the world's most recognised lifeguard but Bondi Rescue's chief lifesaver Bruce 'Hoppo' Hopkins says it's not all fun in the sun, shark-spotting and getting chatted up by girls. The 46-year-old grew up on Sydney's Bronte beach and got into lifesaving as a casual job when he was still at school. Fast forward 23 years and he's performed thousands of rescues but says the scariest one was when they struggled with a semi-conscious snorkeller who was drowning and smashing onto the rocks at Bondi Beach. It's a tough life, but someone's got to do it! Bondi Rescue's head lifesaver Bruce Hopkins details the famous crew's exploits in new book Stories From The Bondi Lifeguards which documents day-to-day life on the beach . And if it wasn't for his 23 years of lifesaving experience the struggling swimmer could have been a goner. 'I was working on Bondi Beach with Kerrbox (fellow lifeguard Rod 'Kerrbox' Kerr)', he tells the Daily Mail Australia. 'And a guy from Fiji or one of the islands had jumped off the rocks to go snorkelling but the surf was huge and he was just getting smashed around. 'His wife had called us, terrified, and he was struggling to stay up because he kept getting pulled under and thrown into the rocks and as soon as we got there I knew we were in trouble. 'We'd gone out with tubes, flippers and a rescue board each and he was a big guy, around 130 kilos and kept sinking the board. He was in a bad way and at times only semi conscious. 'We had to keep swapping the rescue boards and then putting the tubes around him to try and stop him getting bashed from the impact. It was touch and go and took us a long time, about 30 minutes. Living the dream! Just another day at the office for the crew, L-R, Harries, Reidy, Maxi, Kerrbox and Hoppo . 'That's when 23 years of experience comes in as that split-second decision can mean life or death, and if it was one of the younger guys it could have been a very different outcome.' The Bondi Rescue boys, who start filming season 10  next month, shot to stardom in 2006 with their first series on Network Ten and it's a massive hit worldwide. Series 10 starts filming in December and they released a book this weekend, Stories From The Bondi Lifeguards, which details their lives and  day-to-day responsibilities of the beach. 'It's like herding cattle!' Hoppo says the worst thing about his job is when people don't swim between the flags . The stars of the book are Hoppo and his mates, Rod, Anthony 'Harries' Carroll, Trent 'Maxi' Maxwell, Andrew 'Reidy' Reid,  and tells of the hilarious  pranks they play on each other. Like the time they set up an unwitting Maxi and trainee Harrison Reid for a penalty shoot-out against one of the world's top soccer players, Italian Alessandro Del Piero. The lifeguards have also rescued actor Hugh Jackman's children from the ocean and tell how they were paid an impromptu visit from Mr Baywatch himself, David Hasselhoff. They scrub up well! The cast on the red carpet at the 2014 National Rugby League Dally M awards in Sydney . 'We put the uniform on him and he thought he was back in Baywatch,' laughs Bruce. 'He's massive, about 6ft 5, and very funny. 'He really enjoyed it and was telling us a few stories about his Baywatch. Sadly no Pamela Anderson though - we're still waiting for her to come down!' The lifeguards don't get paid for the show but have been able to supplement their  salary from promotional spin-offs and appearances, and 'Hoppo' travels the world as a water safety consultant. 'What keeps me in the job is the lifestyle and you get to meet a lot of people travelling around the world from different cultures, he adds. And the winner goes to... Bondi Rescue: Bruce, Nicola Atherton and Trent Maxwell at the Logies in April.  The series has won Logie Awards Most Popular Factual Program in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 . 'I was in Dubai and an Iraqi guy came up to me. He was beside himself, saying excitedly, 'I can't believe I've met you.' Apparently the show 's very popular in Iraq, which just blows me away. 'And it definitely helps when I go overseas as I get a lot of water safety consulting in India and Japan so I already understand some of heir culture.' Bondi Beach is Sydney's biggest tourist attraction after the Opera House and Bruce says the most annoying thing about the job is when people don't swim in between the flags. 'Sometimes we can have 45,000 people on the beach and instead of swimming between the flags they'll be like, 'oh, that spot looks nice and calm, I'll go over there,' but that's where the rips are. Catching waves: Former World Junior Surfing Champion Nicola Atherton is Bondi's only female lifeguard . 'We try and educate them but when you're dealing with that many people it's impossible to have them all swimming in between the flags anyway so it's a bit like herding cattle!' For anyone planning to head to Bondi this summer, father-of-two Bruce says the northern part of the beach is safest because, 'the rips pull a lot harder down south.' Although he's heading towards his fifth decade Bruce, who also does a lot of yoga to stay supple and strong, says he'll stay in the job as long as his body holds up but also has other projects. In September he launched Bondi Rescue HQ, a juice bar at the north beach which he hopes to turn it into a franchise a few years down the line. Splice as nice: The Hoff relives his Baywatch days patrolling the beach to promote Splice Real Fruit ice cream . 'It's good to have alternatives,' he adds. 'The lifestyle's great and I've been doing this 23 years with my best friends but you're only as good a lifeguard as your body allows. 'I used to race a lot in my 20's and 30's which kept me fit but now it's maintaining it so I've had to change my routine a little bit. 'I probably don't do as much swimming and paddling as I used to but I now mix it up with yoga now and whatever else is needed.' Because the job is so tough and physically demanding - not to mention dangerous - Bruce says it's not something he'd encourage his two daughters, Lauren, 16 and Georgia, 12, to go into. I'm not going to push my daughters into anything,' he says. 'I'm here to guide them but if they were to say they wanted to start going into it now I would be concerned and try and steer them away.' Do hassle the Hoff! The former Baywatch star appeared in episode 3 of series 6 and according to Hoppo is, 'massive, about 6ft 5, and very funny. We put the uniform on him and he thought he was back in Baywatch' Bondi has only had a few female lifeguards and former World Junior Surfing Champion Nicola Atherton is the current one. 'We're all for female life guards,' he says. 'But we don't get that many applying. I think it takes a certain person to come into that culture and obviously it's extremely physically demanding. 'Nicola has just come from the pro-surfing tour and has surfed all around the world so she really knows the ocean and is extremely strong. And she can hold her own.' Sardines: In the summer months approximately 2.2million people flock to Sydney's famous Bondi Beach . In Stories From The Bondi Lifeguards Anthony 'Harries' Carroll talks about the first time he came face-to-face with a shark, just before the TV show started. 'When Kerrbox and I were working on the first pilot,' he writes. 'A guy knocked on the door and said, 'look I have just seen a massive shark out at the point there.'  'I said 'oh yeah? 'Well it's a seal probably'. We get a lot of seals around here. With my luck it may be a mermaid! Or it might have been a dolphin. 'He said, 'Look mate, I have been around here a long time, and I surf and I fish, and this one is massive'. Then people started ringing into the tower. 'I'm not going to push my daughters into anything,' Bruce, pictured here with Lauren and Georgia, says. 'But if they were to say they wanted to start going into it now I would be concerned as it's so physically tough' 'The guys on the cameras got really excited – wow they were going to get a shark in the first show! 'So I went out on the jet ski and couldn't see anything for half an hour. All I could see were about 100 people on the headland screaming at me and pointing at the ocean. 'Then I saw the fin come up – it was around 18-foot and it was a Great White – they got a shot of it and the shot went international. Then we got the show two days later! Surprise surprise! The early days: Bondi Rescue lifeguards: (L-R) Blake McKeown, Dean Gladstone, Bruce Hopkins and Anthony Caroll attend Network Ten's 2008 Program Launch at the Hordern Pavillion  in Sydney . Unsurprisingly Bruce is against the shark-culling that the government trialed earlier this year after a spate of attacks, saying: 'Obviously it's very tragic when a shark attack happens. 'But more people in Australia die from bee-stings than shark attacks. They don't search out humans, it usually happens when they are chasing food and it's been in the wrong place at the wrong time. 'The more sharks you take out of the water affects the ocean, which affects the food chain and everything else. Each time we go into the water we're guests in their playground, their environment.'","He's done thousands of rescues but one where a snorkeller was getting smashed against the rocks was the scariest .
It took Bruce and fellow lifeguard and friend Rod 'Kerrbox' Kerr 30 minutes to rescue the semi conscious man and get him back to shore .
It was 'touch and go' because he kept sinking the surfboard, and if it was a less experienced lifeguard carrying out the rescue the man could have died ."
"Cheaper clothing, cars, household goods and electronic items are just some of the wins for consumers after Australia signed an historic free-trade deal with China worth an estimated $18 billion over a decade. Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Chinese President Xi Jinping witnessed the signing of the pact by their respective trade ministers after Mr Xi addressed federal Parliament in Canberra on Monday afternoon, during which he praised Australia as a country of 'dynamism and innovation'. Under the deal, 85 per cent of all Australian exports will enter China tariff-free, with this figure expected to rise to 93 per cent within four years and 95 per cent when it is in full force. The agreement also removes significant trade barriers for agriculture, resources and energy, manufacturing exports and investment. Scroll down for video . Clothing and footwear, including from Chinese fashion brand Metersbonwe (pictured), is set to become cheaper for Australian consumers . Prime Minister Tony Abbott greets China's President Xi Jinping at Parliament House  in Brisbane on Sunday . Australia and China will reportedly sign a free-trade deal  worth $18 billion over a decade . Mr Abbott is confident the new pact will 'add billions to the economy, create jobs and drive higher living standards for Australians'. China is Australia's number one trading partner, with the two-way flow of goods and services exceeding $150 billion last year. Trade between the countries was worth just a quarter of that amount a decade ago. Mr Xi told parliament his country of 1.3 billion people was a 'market of immense potential', importing more than US$10 trillion in goods over the next five years and investing $500 billion overseas, while its people make over 500 million overseas visits. To further strengthen ties between the two nations, Mr Xi later announced a fifth Chinese consulate-general in Australia will open up in Adelaide, South Australia. The free trade deal is a boon for farmers, with fresh Australian milk selling at up to $9 a litre in China . Farmer Luke Cleary, whose milk sells to China, moves his dairy cows on his farm in Wauchope, NSW . China's President Xi Jinping and First Lady Peng Liyuan wave before departing  the G20 on Sunday . Trade expert Alan Oxley said the main benefit for consumers in the long run would be in the fashion industry. 'But with the way the dollar is jumping around the place, we might not notice for a while,' principal of ITS Global Mr Oxley said. Mr Oxley said Australian exporters of food – especially dairy – would be big beneficiaries of the trade deal in the near future. 'In China there is a fair degree of fear about healthy food,' he said. 'There's a rising fear of people in the middle class willing to pay more for products, and the demand for food is just stupendous. 'That's the future for our farmers.' Mr Oxley said the trade deal would also enable Australian services industries to do business in China. 'Medical services, finance and insurance companies will be able operate in other markets. 'They'll be able to expand their business and do more business. 'That's the real long-term importance of this, because it's not goods that generates the growth it's services.' Trade Minister Andrew Robb, who has done much of the heavy lifting on the deal over the past year, said Australian manufacturers, farmers, miners and the service sector should be very happy with the agreement. Beef and dairy producers are set to benefit from a phase-down in Chinese tariffs, with dairy exports moving to a similar tariff reduction schedule as New Zealand, NewsCorp reports. Mr Robb described the China free trade deal as the completion of a 'powerful trifecta', but could not put a dollar figure on the final leg. But it looks to be huge. Mr Robb revealed the agreement with Beijing - coming hot on the heels of FTAs with Japan and South Korea - was concluded at 'five minutes to midnight' and, as a result, there was no time to do the modelling. Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott speaks to the media  at the conclusion of the G20 summit in Brisbane . A figure of $18 billion is frequently banded around, but that is from modelling done 10 years ago and does not include benefits to the services sector. And services are the breakthrough of this deal with greater access to China for Australia's banking, insurance and securities firms. 'China realises if it is to become a domestically focused economy it will be a service-based economy overwhelmingly,' Mr Robb told reporters in Canberra before he signed a declaration of intent with his Chinese counterpart. Asian middle-classes are expected to grow from 600 million to three billion over the next 30 years. 'They will need our services,' he said. Australian rice, sugar, wheat and cotton will miss out on benefits, but could be winners when a built-in review is conducted in three years. Manufacturers, miners and the service sector including finance and tourism industries are expected to make gains. On entry into force, 92.9 per cent of China's imports of resources, energy and mining products from Australia will enter duty-free, with most remaining tariffs eliminated within four years. It will lock in zero tariffs on Australia's two biggest exports, gold and iron ore, as well as the booming liquefied natural gas industry. The three per cent tariff on Australia's third largest export to China, coking coal, will be axed on day one of the agreement. Chinese televisions, clothes and cars will be cheaper. Tariffs will be abolished for the $13 billion dairy industry and beef and sheep farmers will benefit from the abolition of tariffs ranging from 12 to 25 per cent. All tariffs on horticulture will be eliminated. China will allow greater access for legal, financial, telecommunications, tourism, construction, health, aged care, mining and manufacturing services. With the agreement required to run the gauntlet of a parliamentary inquiry and the passing of some legislation, the government will need to win over Labor, the Greens or crossbenchers on changes to foreign investment and opening of the labour market. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said Labor welcomed the deal which came out of a decade of negotiations. 'We look forward to examining the detail of the final agreement,' he said. The Foreign Investment Review Board screening threshold for private Chinese companies investing in 'non-sensitive' areas will be raised from $278 million to $1.078 billion. The government will still be able to meet its election promise of screening agricultural land purchases valued from $15 million and agribusiness purchases from $53 million. All bids by Chinese state-owned enterprises will be screened regardless of value. ACTU president Ged Kearney said there was a risk that Australian jobs could be lost as labour mobility between the two countries was made easier. Australia will provide visas for a range of Chinese contractors and executives for up to four years, and other business visitors for between three and six months. China will in turn allow certain Australian executives and contractors to stay for up to three years.","Tony Abbott and Xi Jinping have confirmed a free-trade agreement was signed on Monday .

"Night clubbers, beware. An Obamacare evangelist may be coming to a bar near you. On a call outlining its strategy to get people to sign up for Obamacare over the summer, leading Obamacare advocacy group Enroll America said it will get more creative with its outreach tactics – including hitting up night clubs – now that only certain groups of people remain eligible to sign up for health coverage. 'If it's a . health fair, we wanna have a table set up. If it's a long line at a . night club, we want somebody walking up and down it, talking to folks . while they're stuck there,' John Gilbert, National Field Director of Enroll America, told fellow Obamacare recruiters on the call. The group will begin its new outreach operation in May. Pro-Obamacare group Enroll America says it will hit up night clubs, like the one in this file photo, next month to look for people without health insurance . Open enrollment into Obamacare closed on March 31. Among those now eligible for special enrollment are young people aging off of their parents' insurance plans. Under the new rules, insurance companies are required to provide coverage for policyholders' dependents until age 26. Young Invincibles, a youth focused pro-Obamacare group, estimates that 11,500 Americans will turn 26 each day between now and . November when the open enrollment period begins anew.  That's 2.6 million young people, according to a recent Young Invincibles report, based on data . from the U.S. Census Bureau, concludes. There's a 'little bit of a ""Where's . Waldo?"" component' to identifying people who fall into this category, . Enroll America National Field Director John Gilbert said on last week's call. But Enroll America thinks it's figured out a few good places to find and recruit these non-traditional enrollees, including night clubs, court houses and CVS Caremark drug stores. 'If it's a long line at a night club, we want somebody walking up and down it, talking to folks while they're stuck there,' John Gilbert, National Field Director of Enroll America, told fellow Obamacare recruiters on a call . 'We want to go to wherever people are and engage them on their terms,' Gilbert said. The 'terms' on which Enroll America could . find itself with young people waiting in line at the club when it comes . around to lecture them on their health care options might not be good. Young people - who may already be intoxicated - may not be predisposed to discuss serious issues like their health care coverage while they're trying to have a fun evening out with friends. Enroll America did not return a request for further comment on its outreach efforts. 'Obamacare ""youth outreach"" tactics seem to get funnier as time goes on. Now they plan to ask young people in line at clubs to fork over thousands of dollars for a government program designed to rob us?' said Corie Whalen, a spokeswoman for youth advocacy organization Generation Opportunity, in an email to MailOnline. 'Thinking about it though, it makes sense that they wouldn’t waste their time marketing to us while we’re sober.' Best known for its 'Creepy Uncle Sam' ads that feature the government mascot looming over young people during sensitive doctor-patient discussions about their health, 'Gen Opp' has been encouraging young people to 'Opt-Out' of Obamacare. The group's most effective tactic for signing young people to opt out has been holding college tailgate parties. The group told The Weekly Standard in 2013 that it would consider reaching out to young people at events like concerts during warm weather. Enroll America listed court houses as another place it would target for Obamacare outreach. Among those who qualify to sign up for Obamacare outside of the normal enrollment process are people who were recently released from jail and people getting married or divorced - all of whom would have to visit a court house. A location the group said its had success signing people up in the past that it plans to continue recruiting people from is CVS, as seen here at an Enroll America event at a CVS in Texas . Jenny Sullivan, Director of Enroll America's Best Practices Institute, reminded listeners on the call of the importance of keeping enrollment numbers up throughout the rest of the year. 'It . won't be a very great headline if we get 8 million people connected to . coverage, and we don't keep most of those folks connected to coverage a . year from now or seven or eight months from now, ' she said. A location the group said its had success signing people up in the past that it will continue recruiting people from ahead of the open enrollment period that begins in November is CVS, where it sets up tables on free health screening days. City dwellers looking to avoid Obamacare recruiters need not avoid CVS for the foreseeable future, though. CVS will not hold any more free screenings until a date to be determined this fall.","Enroll America is a leading pro-Obamacare group .

"With queues snaking around the block, these are the dramatic scenes as thousands of Romanians line up to vote on British streets. Crowds thronged around polling stations in Portsmouth and London yesterday, waiting for hours to have their say in their country’s presidential election. The pictures provide a clear snapshot of the scale of Romanian migration to the UK. Scroll down for video . Thousands of Romanian immigrants queued around the block in Fratton, Portsmouth, so they could vote in their country's presidential election . Holding the flag: They waited for hours  to cast their vote in a run-off pitting the social democrat prime minister against a centre-right candidate . Making their voice heard: Gabriela Roman (left), 23, and Andreea Monica (right), 25, were among those casting their vote in Portsmouth . Huge interest: One onlooker in the Fratton area of Portsmouth said they 'couldn't believe so many Romanians had turned out to vote' Onlooker Tracey Crawford, from Portsmouth, said: ‘There has been absolute pandemonium. People have parked where they liked and it’s been chaos.’ George Small, 60, added: ‘This was diabolical. I was livid to see such a commotion. You could see cars parked on double yellow lines, in disabled bays and parking without a permit for more than two hours.’ More than 189,000 Romanians and Bulgarians live in Britain, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics – up 42,000 since the start of the year. It means forecasts that 50,000 people a year from the two countries would seek work in the UK following the controversial lifting of employment restrictions look likely to prove correct. A report by the campaign group MigrationWatch UK predicted in April that net migration from inside Europe will hit 130,000 a year if present trends continue. This is the equivalent of adding a city as big as Manchester to the UK’s population every four years. Tens of thousands of Romanians living overseas hope it will be easier for them to cast ballots than it was during the election on November 2 . Busy: An official at the polling station in Portsmouth said they were expecting as many as 10,000 people to vote throughout the day . Queues in Portsmouth: Election results are expected later today, and the winner will replace President Traian Basescu, who is stepping down . Elsewhere in Britain: Romanians wait in line to enter a polling station at the Romanian Embassy in London yesterday . A policeman intervenes between two Romanians arguing as they wait in line to enter a polling station at the Romanian Embassy in London . A Romanian living abroad casts his ballot during the presidential election run-off at a polling station inside the Romanian Embassy in London . Romanians living abroad had hoped they would find it easier to cast their ballots yesterday than during the first round of the presidential election two weeks ago. Then, thousands were prevented from voting because of long queues and early closing times at their embassies, some of which ran out of critical forms. Police were called to London’s Romanian Embassy during the previous vote amid fears of public disorder as hundreds were shut out despite queuing for hours to cast their ballot. Yesterday, an official at the Portsmouth polling station said as many as 10,000 people were expected to vote during the day. The long queues provide a contrast to elections in the UK where the turnout is often embarrassingly low. An onlooker at the polling station in Portsmouth said: ‘I couldn’t believe so many Romanians had turned out to vote. ‘They clearly take politics in their own country very seriously, even though they now live nearly 2,000 miles away.’ Portsmouth South MP Mike Hancock said: ‘The Romanian Embassy contacted me to ask if the voting could be held in Portsmouth because it’s a central space for Romanians around the area. ‘The first round was held two weeks ago and it was okay. There were queues but nothing this dramatic.’ The election is being contested by prime minister Victor Ponta and the mayor of the city of Sibiu, Klaus Iohannis.

"Most of them speak English as their second language, but that didn’t stop students in a state primary from getting higher grades than many of their counterparts in private schools. Grinling Gibbons primary school in Deptford in inner-city southeast London, where more than half of the pupils are so poor they get free school meals, ranked fourth place in a new school league table. The survey - The Sunday Times Parent Power league table of 600 schools - found it was the highest position reached by a state primary since the annual ranking began 22 years ago. Students in Grinling Gibbons in Deptford in inner-city southeast London ranked fourth in a survey of 600 primary and independent prep schools, scoring high marks in maths and in English grammar (file photo) Parents of the some 350 pupils from largely African heritage families credit the executive head teacher Cynthia Eubank for creating an inspirational atmosphere for children to learn. Ms Eubank said hiring staff suitable for the style of teaching necessary for the standards of Grinling Gibbons was a challenge and recalled one who showed he wasn’t suitable. She told The Sunday Times: ‘I had one chap come into a year 5 classroom and look through the work and tell me, “Your standards are too high and you want me to work too hard”.’ Apart from regular classes in traditional subjects, pupils are offered yoga, philosophy and swimming classes to help them learn. The survey found every 11-year-old at the state primary scored a level 5 in standard assessment tests (Sats) – the level expected of a 13-year-old – for English reading and grammar last year. Parents of the some 350 pupils in Grinling Gibbons, where students are largely of African heritage, credit the executive head teacher Cynthia Eubank for creating an inspirational atmosphere for children to learn . The study found that in maths the figure was 98% and in English writing 86%. But the top school in the table - Haberdashers’ Aske’s prep school in Slestree, Hertfordshire - 98% of year 6 pupils scored level 5 in maths and English grammar and 96% in reading and writing. Parents pay annual fees of up to £16,662 to send their children to the private institution. The top marks scored in English reading and grammar by pupils in Grinling Gibbons primary come after one school this year took an unusual move to teach English as a foreign language. City of Leeds comprehensive, which has been transformed by the arrival of large numbers of migrants, was thought to be the first in the country to take the extraordinary step.","Many pupils in Grinling Gibbons in London are so poor they get free meals .

"Trainee teachers face tough new tests in the three Rs to root out those unable to do the job. Ofsted inspectors found some staff, particularly in primary schools, have a poor grasp of subjects, leading to gaps in children’s knowledge. Ministers fear entrance exams are too easy and allow trainees with a poor mastery of English and maths to slip through. Spelling it out: Trainee teachers will be given tougher tests to ensure they are proficient in the three Rs in a bid to weed out poor performers . While new tests are being devised, the pass mark for existing tests in literacy and numeracy will be raised in September with fewer resits allowed. One in five trainees fails to pass either literacy or numeracy first time around while one in ten trainees has to take the numeracy tests three times or more. Schools Minister Nick Gibb announced yesterday that an expert panel will review the current tests with a view to devising new-look assessments. ‘International studies show that rigorous selection of trainee teachers is key to raising the quality and standing of the teaching profession,’ he said . Raising standards: The review announced by Schools Minister Nick Gibb (left) will be led by Sally Coates (right), principal of Burlington Danes Academy in London . ‘It helps ensure trainees are committed to becoming teachers. ‘Strengthened trainee tests and an end to constant re-sits will mean parents can be confident that all teachers have the basic skills needed.’ The review will be led by Sally Coates, principal of Burlington Danes Academy in west London, and will report back to ministers by June, to allow the new tests to be introduced in September 2013. From this September, the pass mark for the current tests will be raised. Trainees who fail one or both of the tests at the first attempt will be limited to two resits for each test. They will also have to pass the test before starting their course, so those without the right skills cannot start the training. Schools Minister Nick Gibb . The Coalition has already announced plans to give out bursaries worth £20,000-a-year to students with first-class degrees who train to teach so-called shortage subjects such as maths and languages. Lower bursaries will be available to students with 2.1s and 2.2s. Heads are also being handed tough new powers to sack incompetent staff. The skills tests were introduced by Labour amid concerns that teacher training did not guarantee a thorough grounding in literacy, numeracy and comprehension. Passing the numeracy test has been a requirement of Qualified Teacher Status since 2000, and literacy the following year. Students currently sit the online tests during their teacher training. They were originally allowed only four or five attempts to pass the tests. But Labour scrapped the rule in 2001 and gave trainees unlimited resits. The numeracy test lasts 48 minutes and contains 12 mental arithmetic questions to be completed without the aid of a calculator. Candidates are allowed to use pen and paper. There are also longer questions involving interpreting statistical information and working out basic percentages and ratios. The 45-minute literacy test is in four parts - spelling, grammar, punctuation and comprehension.","Some staff have poor grasp of subjects, says Ofsted .

"'Is mummy going to come back to life?' In what must be a living nightmare, this was the heart-wrenching question asked by Chris Walden's five-year-old son, Cooper, after his mother was tragically killed in a car accident. The NewsMail reported how Mr Walden had to tell his son the devastating news that his mother had died in a car crash on Saturday evening, and he wouldn't ever see her again. Cooper is the youngest of five children Amanda ""Mandy"" Roberts, 36, leaves behind after she was killed in a horrific car accident near Childers on Saturday evening. Cooper's siblings Brittany, 15, Callum, 14 Riley, 11, and Maddy, 9, were also left grieving the loss of their mother. Amanda Roberts, right, died in a car accident on Saturday evening in North Gregory, Queensland . Ms Roberts, who lived in Rubyanna, called Mr Cooper earlier that afternoon saying she was going to pick up Cooper from his house - they shared custody of the five-year-old. 'She wanted to pick him up and I had him, and I said 'He's better off just staying with me', which I'm so glad I did,' he said. 'I'm so glad that I kept him now. 'I said 'Just ring him up', so she did and she had a chat with him.' Just three hours later she was dead. Ms Roberts also leaves behind five siblings, Peter, 32, Jason, 34, Dannielle, 26, Dana, 13, and Sarah, 16. Ms Roberts, who lived in Rubyanna, was a mother of five . The crash happened in North Gregory at around 6.45pm when a vehicle travelling on Goodwood Road crossed the road and collided with another vehicle. Initial police investigations said a blue 2005 Mitsubishi 380 sedan, being driven by Ms Roberts south along Goodwood Road north of Childers, crossed the road and collided with another vehicle travelling north. The Mitsubishi then also collided with another north-bound vehicle. Ms Roberts was pronounced dead at the scene. The drivers of the two other vehicles received minor injuries and were transported to Bundaberg Hospital. The Queensland forensic crash unit are now investigating the tragic incident. Messages of condolences were left on  Ms Roberts' (right) Facebook page . It is a tragedy that has rocked Ms Roberts' family and the local community, with Mandy's mum and dad, Brenda and Ron, left struggling to come to terms with their loss. 'They're not doing very well at the moment,"" she told NewsMail. Ms Tasker said she asked Brenda how she wanted her daughter to be remembered. 'She said: 'She was just happy and she lit up the room when she walked in', she said. Mandy's sister Sarah agreed and said she would remember her sister by how funny, beautiful and kind-hearted she was.

"A two-year-old boy suffered horrific facial injuries when he was mauled by a family's pet bullmastiff as he played in the kitchen of his mother's boyfriend's home. Ollie Cummings was standing next to the dog as it was eating when it suddenly turned and began biting his head. The toddler was left with a deep cut across his face and has undergone surgery to rebuild a section of his nose. Shocking: Ollie Cummings, right before the brutal attack, suffered bite marks and a deep cut across his face . His mother, Natasha Wilson, 25, snatched her son from the dog's teeth before calling an ambulance to the Dundee home on Friday night. The two-year-old was taken to Ninewells Hospital where he underwent a two-hour operation. He will need further surgery when he is nine or 10 years old. Speaking from hospital, Ollie's grandmother, Debs Martin, 48, said: 'Ollie had been playing with some keys, walking from one door to another pretending to lock and unlock them. 'It all happened so fast. We're not sure if he maybe dropped the keys next to the dog. There are teeth marks on his head and a large cut from his nose to near his eye. 'His nose is being rebuilt. The doctors say that is a clean cut. The biggest worry is preventing infection.' She said that her grandson, who celebrates his third birthday on November 23, was used to being around the dog.

A Police Scotland spokesman said: 'We are unable to comment at this time.' Savage: Ollie was mauled by a bullmastiff while at his mother's boyfriend's house. (File image of a bullmastiff) The law concerning dangerous dogs was toughened up in Scotland earlier this year, giving new powers to local councils and requiring better registration. Dog attacks in the UK are one of the most common causes of severe facial lacerations in children. Each year, approximately 28,000 facial dog bites are reported in the UK, with just over 19,000 of them requiring some degree of plastic surgery.","Ollie Cummings was playing in the kitchen when the dog attacked him .

"The internet is awash with shaky smartphone footage, but a group of filmmakers has proved that it's possible to use them to make entire movies fit for the big screen. Uneasy Lies The Mind is the first narrative feature length movie to be shot entirely on the iPhone. One issue the makers had to overcome while filming the 88-minute movie was the fact that phones don't work very well in cold temperatures and the shoot was in America's frigid Mammoth Lakes in California. But it turned out that keeping it under their armpits helped. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Good call: Uneasy Lies The Mind is the first feature film to be shot entirely on an iPhone . The heat was on: The makers kept the iPhone under their arms to keep the phone working in the cold . Director/producer/cinematographer Ricky Fosheim said: 'Extremely cold weather, as low as five degrees fahrenheit, proved to be one of the most difficult hurdles while shooting. A fully charged iPhone 5 will die in less than two minutes when exposed to these frigid cold temperatures. ‘In between takes the filmmakers would have to place the camera underneath their armpits in order to keep it warm. Numerous takes were lost because the camera would continuously die mid-shot.’ The makers say that while there have been numerous 'found footage' iPhone movies - self-reflexive movies in which the actors hold and talk directly to the iPhone - a couple of documentaries and numerous short films, their movie is the first traditional narrative feature shot entirely on the iPhone. The movie’s plot revolves around Peter, a freshly minted movie star. He has it all: wealth, fame and a beautiful expecting wife. Budget production: The film cost just $10,000 to make . Disturbing: Shot in California, Uneasy Lies The Mind tells the story of a man's sanity slowly unravelling . Tech talk: The filmmakers used an iPhone 5 fitted with a lens adaptor called the Turtle Back . Girl, interrupted: Many of the shots had to be redone because the iPhone's battery died . But when the couple’s two best friends join them at their new mountain mansion for Peter’s birthday, envy, secrets and paranoia play out behind a barren winter landscape. Soon the two couples grow increasingly antagonistic and turn to alcohol and drugs to bury thepast. When an old friend shows up unexpectedly, Peter must scramble to protect his new life. Theharder he fights to hold it all together, the faster he descends into a cavernous mental abyss. As the night grows late, Peter is forced to decipher reality from a twisting rabbit hole of truth andillusion. The film, shot on a budget of just $10,000 (£6,000) by Detention Films, is told from the perspective of a man who has been robbed and violently hit over the head. As he lays dying in the middle of an open field, the story unfolds through his fragmented and traumatized memories. These memories are far from crisp and clean, so the visuals in the story needed to reflect this, the makers said. Horror: Uneasy Lies The Mind has some disturbing scenes . They originally wanted to shoot on 16mm film. Without the budget for it, they decided to go on a quest to replicate a 16mm film aesthetic with modern day camera technology. After playing around with the iPhone 5, and a lens adaptor called the Turtle Back, they fell in love with the look and knew right away that this was the aesthetic in which to tell the story. The . Fosheim added: 'In the middle of the Turtle Back Lens Adaptor is a glass focusing screen with a patterned texture, almost like a finger print. Hair, dirt, and oil from my hands would always get stuck on these focusing screens. 'I completely welcomed these textured imperfections and chose not to clean or replace any of the dirty parts. At times I would even add dust and dirt. 'While shooting I used the Filmic Pro app. It’s incredibly powerful and allows you to control the frame rate, compression, and numerous other settings.' The movie is being shown at the Cinequest Film Festival in San Jose on March 8 and the following day at the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas.","Uneasy Lies The Mind was shot using an iPhone 5 and a lens adapter .

"For three years Bao Lulin found herself continually mistaken for someone else. Lulin, a waitress from Jiuyang in Guizho, southern China, was puzzled by the number of people who approached and spoke to her as if they knew her. They would ask her about her work in Fujian Province, mistake her for the daughter-in-law of a complete stranger or ask why she did not recognise them. However, Lulin had never before seen any of them in her life. Likeness: Chinese twins, Yanfei (left) and Lulin, were separated at birth but found each other by accident many years later . The 24-year-old vowed to tracked down her mysterious doppelganger and was stunned to find she had an identical twin sister who was separated from her at birth. Lulin's incredible journey of discovery began in June 2009, when she was helping a relative run his fruit stand when four grannies approached her. 'You have come back from Fujian Province? Why didn't you inform us?,' one commented . When a confused Lulin asked who they were, another scoffed: 'You must earn big money, and don't want to know us.' Just a few months later a middle-aged man approached Lulin, who worked as a cashier in a restaurant in Jiuyang and told her: 'You look absolutely identical to one of my relatives.' Happy: Twins Lulin (left) and Yanfei even have similar smiles . The sisters share similar tastes, mannerisms, personalities and even have husbands with the same name . Not long after a confused teenager dining at the restaurant approached Lulin and said, 'Yanfei, you work here now?' Lulin decided to search for this mysterious Yanfei but soon after fell pregnant and had to put the plan on hold. The married mother-of-one said: 'The idea to look for her was always in my mind. I wanted to look for her after my son got a bit bigger.' In the end it was three years before Lulin was able to start her search for her ringer. Confusion: Lulin (left) was always being mistaken for Yanfei and decided to track her down . Friends: The sisters quickly became close despite the gulf of years since their seperation . Family: Lulin (top left) and Yanfei with Yanfei's adoptive parents . Yanfei and her adopted parents. The twins quickly realised they had been separated at birth and sent to live with different families . In October Lulin was once again mistaken for Yanfei at work but she saw her opportunity and managed to get the woman's address from the diner. Last month Yang Yanfei, also of Jiuyang, was playing with her son at home when she suddenly heard her mother-in-law shout, 'Yanfei, come here now!' Yanfei was alarmed by her mother-in-law's urgent tone and when she ran out a woman was standing with her back to her and suddenly turned around. Yanfei was shocked - Lulin was almost identical to her. The married mother-of-one, said: 'I felt I was looking into the mirror.' Lulin added: 'We felt like we had known each other for years and years.' Yanfei's son (left) bears an uncanny resemblance to his cousin (right) Childhood injury Yanfei and Lulin also have almost identical scars from accidents when they were both just six . The sisters were stunned at the number of similarities, including fashion, hobbies and even foods . It emerged both Yanfei and Lulin were adopted as babies and have realised that they must have been twins who were separated at birth. There are many uncanny similarities between the sisters beyond their physical likeness. They both got married in 2007, both of their husbands have the same given name, Bin, and their sons also look identical. They have the same voice, same friendly, out-going personality, share a number of hobbies, a similar style of dressing, and enjoy the same foods. They even have the same scar on their finger after having similar accidents when they were six. Baby girls are often given up for adoption in China because of the One Child policy. Boys are more valued in Chinese society because they carry on the ancestral name and inheritance laws pass property on to sons. Because of this hundreds of thousands of baby girls are abandoned every year in China. Twins, however, are exempt from the policy.","Bao Lulin was constantly mistaken for someone called 'Yanfei'

"A British playboy is behind a dating website that uses fake profiles to lure singletons into paying to subscribe. Billy Thomas runs JDI Dating, a Hampshire-based network of online dating sites including CupidsWand.com and FindMeLove.com. The 27-year-old boasts online of living in a waterfront apartment, driving a Mercedes and of enjoying holidays in exotic locations like Mexico and Egypt. British playboy: Billy Thomas is said to be behind JDI Dating which was fined in the US for using 'virtual cupids' to lure singles into signing up for paid subscriptions - something the site continues to do . JDI Dating is a Hampshire-based network of online dating sites including CupidsWand.com and FindMeLove.com . Last month the firm paid nearly £400,000 to settle a case in the US brought by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for allegedly using 'virtual Cupids' to encourage internet users to sign up to a website. The scheme works by matching users with attractive singles who live nearby and have seemingly genuine profiles that include photographs and list their interests. According to an investigation by The Sunday Times, Mr Thomas is continuing to use virtual Cupids. Within minutes of creating a profile one of its reporters was contacted by a 23-year-old woman, but when he tried to reply to her the journalist was redirected to a subscription page, where he was informed he could sign up for a £101 a year. A short time later another woman contacted him. An attempt to respond to her also led the reporter to the subscriptions page. According to the Sunday Times, both women's profiles were created by the dating site, something that was indicated by a small grey VC symbol in the top right corner of the profile. JDI Dating owns 18 websites, including CupidsWand.com, and boasts having 12million global members . When the symbol is clicked the customer is directed to the sites terms and conditions, which states the site uses virtual profiles. JDI Dating owns 18 websites and boasts having 12million global members. Tests conducted by the paper on the JDI website, DateAgency.com's homepage revealed all of the 'most popular' profiles were those of virtual Cupids.

"Pressure is mounting to ban a highly concentrated alcohol from Australian shelves, following the tragic death of a teenage girl at her 18th birthday party. Nicole Bicknell, from Thornlie in Perth's south-east, only had a couple of shots of  Polish-made alcohol Polmos Spirytus Rektyfikowany, which has an alcohol content of 95 per cent, two weeks ago before she died just a few hours later. The family told Perth Now the young woman had only had a few mixed drinks before being offered the spirit by a male friend. 18 year old Nicole Bicknell died a couple of hours after consuming shots of highly concentrated alcohol Polmos Spirytus Rektyfikowany on her 18th birthday . While the family is still waiting on the official report for the cause of Nicole's death, they believe drinking the Polish spirit was what killed her and are now advocating for a complete ban of the sale of high strength alcohol in Australia. 'I cannot see why alcohol so strong is sold in liquor stores,' grandfather Kevin McLean told News Corp. 'No one needs to buy alcohol that strong. It should be taken off the shelves so this doesn’t happen to any other family. 'We want it banned Australia-wide and we would like to see it an offence to sell it.' Australian Drug Foundation's Geoff Munroe told Daily Mail Australia it was 'extraordinary' the Polish spirit did not come with a warning. 'There's no warning on the bottle but there's a warning on cough mixture that says you shouldn't drink alcohol or drive a motor car [when you take it] as well as a warning on aspirin,' he said. Geoff Munroe from the Australian Drug Foundation (pictured) says highly concentrated alcohol should come with a warning to consumers . 'Alcohol is the only lethal product I can think of where a manufacturer does not have to provide a warning. 'It's extraordinary the alcohol industry refuses to warn its own customers and it's astonishing they get away with it.' It is believed the Australian Medical Association tried to ban the alcohol a couple of years ago but were unsuccessful. 'It's a poison, a toxin that can cause outright liver damage and kills the cells and also has a direct suppressive effect on the brain,' Australian Medical Association member Dr Brain Mawson said. 'It also has an effect on our hearts, can induce arrhythmia in regular heart beats, a lethal irregular heartbeat.' While he admits that Australians need to look at their own attitude towards consuming alcohol, citing most think it's acceptable to have too many, highly concentrated alcohol should have better labelling. 'Its true content needs to be in a larger print or have diagrams as an easy way for people to understand [alcohol content].' The Polish spirit is 95% alcohol and online alcohol retailers warn consumers to drink it diluted . And while he's not all for a complete ban on high strength alcohol, Dr. Mawson says we should maybe look at doing the same thing as we do with cigarettes. 'A lock and key to ask for it,' he said. Polmos Spirytus Rektyfikowany . * Rectified spirit from Poland . * Mainly produced from grain . * 95% alcohol concentration (190 proof) * Effectively a pure spirit . * Used for medicinal purposes, household solvent . * Recommended drunk chilled, diluted . * 500ml, $55-$70 pricetag (online and shelf) Spirytus Rektyfikowany is what is known as a rectified spirit from Poland and is often used as a base for liqueurs and other infusions. A 500ml bottle equals about 38 standard drinks, more than double the potentially lethal dose for an average adult. It is believed to have medicinal purposes and can be used as a household solvent. A number of online alcohol sites that stock the highly concentrated drink warn people it should be diluted when consumed and is not recommended to be consumed on its own. When Daily Mail Australia called Dan Murphy's liquor store, a customer service representative confirmed the brand had been discontinued most likely because of its high concentration of alcohol. The representative said it was the only rectified liquor that Dan Murphy's stocked and it was now off the shelves although some independent stores would most likely still stock it. It iss believed Woolworths Liquor group have pulled the potent alcohol off its shelves . It is believed the Woolworths Liquor group have also pulled the potent alcohol off its shelves and when Daily Mail Australia tried to search for the brand at chains, such as Coles' Liquorland website, it revealed there was none available. Wineanthology.com said this extraordinarily strong spirit needed to be treated with respect. 'It is questionable whether the human body is meant to digest such strong substances,' it said on its website. 'Being effectively pure ethyl-alcohol, it is more commonly used in cooking, in the preparation of fruit and herb tinctures, for medicinal purposes, or by home perfume makers.' Ms Bicknell's death came before the Western Australian government passed laws which will see adults face criminal prosecution for supplying juveniles with alcohol. From next year, anyone who buys alcohol on behalf of a minor in the state will run the risk of 'tough' penalties, Racing and Gaming Minister Terry Waldron said. The penalties are yet to be determined but the laws will also allow parents, guardians or anyone who has their consent to responsibly supply drinks to juveniles on unlicensed premises such as private homes.","Teenager Nicole Bicknell died after consuming shots of Polmos Spirytus Rektyfikowany at her 18th party .

"An artist created a series of sculptures that were so small they could be stood on the head of an ant, balanced on a human hair or placed in the eye of a needle. Jonty Hurwitz made the extraordinary figures, called nano sculptures, using groundbreaking 3D printing technology. The largest of his series of seven sculptures was about the width of a strand of human hair - the smallest is less than half that width. After 10 months of designing, sculpting and rendering, he was finally able to see his figures using an incredibly powerful microscope that is used to examine cancer cells. But after just a few fleeting moments, his creations were destroyed - smudged by a colleague's finger. Scroll down for video . Groundbreaking: The nano sculptures, created using 3D printing technology, were so small that they could be placed in the eye of a needle . Muse: The human figures were made using data taken from hundreds of photos taken of a woman who posed in a number of positions . Dwarfed: This digital image reveals the scale of one of the seven pieces, inspired by a neoclassical sculpture, compared to the head of an ant . Mr Hurwitz was inspired by 18th century sculpture 'Psyche Revived by Cupid’s Kiss' by Antonia Canova, which shows the winged figure of the god Eros - Cupid in Latin - holding a girl, Psyche, in a tender embrace. The 10-month project started with taking scans of his muse as she stood naked in different poses that recalled Canova's neoclassical sculpture. He shares his journey to creating 'the smallest creation of the human form' on his website. She was positioned in the centre of roughly 250 cameras that had been assembled in a dome - ready to take simultaneous images of her body from every angle. A high-powered computer programme was used to take all of the data that was captured on camera and reassemble it into images - into something that Mr Hurwitz calls 'digital clay'. The sculptures were printed — with advice from the Weizmann Institute of technology, using a complex 3D printing technique, with another technique used to achieve the fine detail work. Tender: The figures were based on Psyche Revived by Cupid’s Kiss, an 18th century sculpture by Antonia Canova that features the god Eros . Minuscule: The entwined figures, seen on the head of an ant, could only be seen using a microscope that is used to study cancer cells . Intricate: Hurwitz could not see the sculptures when they arrived - placed on a mirror in a jewellery box packed in layers of bubble wrap . All seven of them were so small that when they arrived - on a tiny piece of mirror, in a jewellery box, wrapped in layers of boxes and bubble wrap - he couldn't see anything. Eventually saw what looked like seven minuscule dust particles that were caught in the light. After a hunt to find a microscope that was strong enough to pick up the detail of the figures - only one used to study cancer cells was strong enough - and 45 minutes searching the mirror, Mr Hurwitz was finally able to see his sculptures. He said: 'everything just stops and everyone goes silent, and we stare at this, this feat of humanity, for minutes.' But when his colleague tried to move the mirror to see his creations from a different angle, they were crushed - and the nano sculptures were lost forever. Elegant: This piece, called trust, was made using 'digital clay' that was assembled from information contained in hundreds of photographs . Mythical: From this angle of Cupid and Psyche The First Kiss the god's wings can be seen in white and the figures' legs are stretched out . Fleeting: The sculptures, which took 10 months to create, were destroyed when Hurwitz's colleague accidentally crushed them with his finger .","Sculptures were so small they could be stood on the head of an ant or balanced on a strand of human hair .

"Her role as Lieutenant Uhura in Star Trek inspired the first black astronaut to fulfill her dreams of working with Nasa. But Nichelle Nichols might have left to pursue a career on Broadway were it not for the intervention of a very unlikely Trekkie - Dr Martin Luther King Jr. Although he's best known for his rousing speeches promising a future of freedom and equality for downpressed African Americans, it transpires the civil rights leader also had in mind a far more distant future. Trailblazers: Nichelle Nichols is pictured left as Lieutenant Uhura, on board the Star Ship Enterprise. She nearly left the role after the show's first season until Dr Martin Luther King, right, persuaded her to stay . 'He said, ""You have one of the most important roles, this is a first. It's non-stereotypical, it's brilliant, it's beauty and it's intelligence"",' Nichols told Neil DeGrasse Tyson, the astrophysicist and broadcaster. 'He said, ""You cannot leave, do you understand? It has been heavenly ordained. This is God's gift and onus for you. You have changed the face of television forever."" Now 82, Nichols 1966 debut on Star Trek as a black woman playing an educated character was groundbreaking for its time. It was the era of the Black Panthers, and of race riots in Watts, Newark and Detroit, as black communities fought to realise the potential of the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts passed to enshrine equality in law. Nichols pictured in 2010: Her 1966 debut on Star Trek as a black woman playing an educated character was groundbreaking for its time . But even with all the turmoil of the age, Nichols hadn't fully grasped the racial and cultural implications of her Star Trek role, still thinking of herself as just a cast member on the show. In fact, she had already decided to move on from the role and even handed her letter of resignation to producer Gene Roddenberry when she met King. 'I had been invited as a celebrity guest at a NAACP fundraiser in Beverly Hills,' she told Tyson, in the interview first aired in 2011 but still available on his website. 'One of the promoters came up and said someone wanted to meet me. He said he's your greatest fan ... I'm thinking it's a Trekker, maybe a child, maybe a young man. 'And so I turned and I see this man across the room with this brilliant smile, which you didn't often see on his face. And I remember saying to myself, 'Whoever this little Trekker is they're going to have to wait because this is my leader, Dr Martin Luther King, walking towards me with a smile on his face."" 'And he walks to me and with this smile he says, ""Miss Nichols, I am your greatest fan.""' Nichols says King spoke to her about her role in Star Trek and how important it was to the future of the civil rights movement. He praised Roddenberry, the producer, as a visionary, adding 'we [black people] are there, because you are there.' Said to be one of the first black women to appear in a major television series in a role not portraying a servant, Nichols did prove to be an inspiration to a generation of young people. Mae Jemison, an American doctor who became the first black woman in space on board the Space Shuttle Endeavour in 1992, has said she was she was inspired to join Nasa by Nichols' portrayal of Uhura. And Nichols is also credited with having the first interracial kiss on network television, with William Shatner's Captain Kirk, during a 1968 episode of the show. Groundbreaking: Nichols is also credited with having the first interracial kiss on American network television, with William Shatner's Captain Kirk, during a 1968 episode of the show . After Star Trek's cancellation after three seasons amid failing ratings, Nichols volunteered her time to Nasa for a special project to recruit ethnic-minority and female personnel for the agency. She is credited with helping to recruit Dr Sally Ride, the first American female astronaut, and United States Air Force Colonel Guion Bluford, the first African-American astronaut. She also helped bring in Dr Judith Resnik and Dr Ronald McNair, who both flew successful missions during the Space Shuttle program before their deaths in the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.","Nichelle Nichols was set to take up an offer to of a role on Broadway .

"An effective moratorium on new onshore wind farms will be in place within six months of a Tory election victory next year, the party will pledge today. Energy Minister Michael Fallon will say that there is ‘no requirement  for any more’ of the turbines  erected across the country with  little or no regard for the views of local communities. The Conservative manifesto will also pledge to scrap the subsidies paid by bill-payers for onshore wind power and change the planning system to allow local councils to block any which do not already have planning consent. Blight: Turbines in Anglesey, North Wales. The Conservatives will pledge today that an effective moratorium on new onshore wind farms will be in place within six months of a Tory election victory next year . Pledge: Energy Minister Michael Fallon will say that there is 'no requirement for any more' of the turbines  erected across the country with  little or no regard for the views of local communities . The key reforms would be implemented six months after a majority Conservative government is elected, Mr Fallon is expected to say. The move represents a major concession by . David Cameron – who once urged voters to ‘vote blue, go green’ and . erected a turbine on the roof of his house – to sceptical Tory MPs. The Tories have gradually lost their enthusiasm for green policies since 2006. ‘Vote blue, go green. We have to think global, act local’ Conservative Party  manifesto, April 2006 . ‘We are not going to drop the environmental agenda. We will take forward our green agenda in a way that strengthens the economy – not “green” or “growth”, but both’ David Cameron, June 2008 . ‘I want us to be the greenest government ever – a very simple ambition and one that I’m absolutely committed to achieving’ Mr Cameron, May 2010 . ‘Onshore wind plays a role in a balanced UK electricity mix, alongside gas, nuclear, cleaner coal and other forms of renewable energy. I am also determined that we seize the economic  opportunities in renewable energy supply chains’ Mr Cameron, Feb 2012 . ‘We can no longer have wind turbines imposed on communities. I can’t single-handedly build a new Jerusalem but I can protect our green and  pleasant land’ Former Tory energy minister John Hayes, Oct 2012 . ‘There’s a limited potential for onshore wind. Frankly, we’ve got some in the UK – I don’t think we’re going to have a huge amount more’ Mr Cameron, Aug 2013 . ‘Get rid of all the green c**p’ Mr Cameron, reportedly, to aides, Nov 2013 . ‘Unthinking climate change worship has damaged British industry and put up bills’ Tory energy minister Michael Fallon, Feb 2014 . ‘Wind farms have a place – and it is offshore by and large. They work better in the sea because it’s windier, so they don’t have to blight the landscape’ Tory party chairman Grant Shapps, April 2014 . The Prime Minister has been persuaded that Britain can meet targets for increasing the amount of power generated by onshore wind farms through those that have already been built and those with planning consent. The 4,000 existing onshore wind turbines, which have enjoyed generous subsidies for 20 years, deliver power to four million homes. A further 3,000, for which planning permission has been given, will deliver power to three  million more by 2020. Mr Fallon said: ‘Making sure we have a good mixture of reliable energy is an important part of our long-term economic plan. ‘We remain committed to cutting our carbon emissions – and renewable energy, including onshore wind, has a key role in our future energy supply. 'But we now have enough billpayer-funded onshore wind in the pipeline to meet our renewable energy commitments. ‘That’s why the next Conservative government will end any additional billpayer subsidy for onshore wind, and give local councils the decisive say on any new wind farms.’ A government source said that a majority Tory government would ‘effectively curtail further large-scale onshore wind developments’, adding: ‘If elected, we would make these changes within the first six months.’ As well as ending subsidies, which mean wind farm owners are paid nearly double the going rate for every unit of energy they generate for the National Grid, legislation would be introduced to reform applications for new developments. Applications for new wind farms have to be made to local authorities, and around a half are refused. But under the existing system, energy firms often win on appeal to the Government’s planning inspectorate. The Tories say the entire process would be handled by councils through a locally-led planning system, not a national regime which prioritises ‘significant infrastructure’ projects as at present. The party will also pledge to ensure that concerns about the impact of projects on landscapes and heritage sites cannot be overturned except in exceptional circumstances. The party’s shift in policy appears timed with next month’s local elections in mind, given the controversy generated by wind turbines in many areas. It opens up a significant dividing line for the Conservatives with Labour and the Liberal Democrats, who enthusiastically support more wind power. Ed Miliband told the Mail that Britain would have to ‘embrace’ onshore wind if Labour wins next year. Prime Minister: The move represents a major concession by David Cameron - who once urged voters to 'vote blue, go green' and erected a turbine on the roof of his house - to sceptical Tory MPs . Last night Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat Energy Secretary, said: ‘I know what our Coalition Government policy is: It is to invest in renewables, to invest in low carbon, and onshore wind is a major part of that investment. ‘Onshore wind is the cheapest form of renewable electricity, and if you were to not go ahead with that investment you would see people’s bills go up.’ Britain must invest £33billion in infrastructure if the country is to make the most of its shale gas reserves, says a study today. Commissioned by the UK Onshore Operators Group which represents fracking firms, it estimates that 4,000 wells will be drilled over 18 years. Greenpeace claimed the report was ‘rose-tinted industry  guess-timates’ and ‘a veiled plea  for government and taxpayer support’.","Reforms to come in six months after majority Tory government elected .

"The short-term housing rental service Airbnb has paid back taxes that ran into the millions of dollars to the city of San Francisco, the company said yesterday. The popular San Francisco-based company said in a statement that it has paid in full a back-tax bill. A spokesman declined to say how much the company paid. City Treasurer Jose Cisneros ruled in 2012 that Airbnb owed back taxes. He  declined to reveal how much money he collected from Airbnb, saying local law mandates confidentiality on all tax matters. Tourist hot spot: Airbnb is believed to have paid the city of San Francisco an estimated $25million to clear back hotel taxes that had threatened to undermine its support among local people and politicians . Officials had estimated that Airbnb owed the city as much as $25 million, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. The back-tax issue had threatened to unravel legislation that the supervisors passed last year legalizing short-term home rentals in the city. The law mandated that Airbnb pay the city's hotel tax going forward, but it didn't address issue of back taxes. The law, which took effect February 1, allows only permanent residents to offer short-term rentals; it requires hosts register with the city and get a business license and permit; and it mandates the collection of hotel tax. It also limits entire-home rentals to 90 days per year, requires each listing to carry $500,000 in liability insurance, and establishes guidelines for enforcement by the Planning Department. David Campos, a member of San Francisco's Board of Supervisors, who had campaigned on the back taxes issue, called the announcement 'a major victory'. 'We are glad they did this, but I don’t know if congratulations are in order for someone who paid their taxes three years late,' he told the San Francisco Chronicle. But he said he and other critics of the Airbnb business model would continue to pressure the company over its impact on housing stock. They had worried the short-term rental marketplace was harming residential neighborhoods and subverting the city's rent controls. San Francisco sights: Critics had complained that Airbnb-style rentals were turning city neighborhoods into de facto hotels, worsening a housing shortage by keeping badly needed rental homes off the market . Along with Uber and others, Airbnb has been a flagship of the so-called 'sharing economy', with some economists saying such 'peer to peer' models tap underused resources and encourage more people to become entrepreneurs. But it has sparked complaints from the hotel sector, which argued it doesn't have to meet the same requirements for licensing, safety and insurance, making the competition unfair. In San Francisco, critics had complained that Airbnb-style rentals were turning neighborhoods into de facto hotels, worsening a housing shortage by keeping badly needed rental homes off the market. The same gripes are being felt coast to coast. Proponents and critics crowded a New York City Council hearing last month to argue over whether Airbnb saps housing affordability of helps it. On one side were tenants who say landlords are illegally turning their homes into de facto hotels by renting apartments to high-paying tourists instead of full-time residents. On the other were homeowners and tenants who say Airbnb provides crucial income in a city where even a studio apartment can easily top $2,000 a month. The debate is perhaps most pointed in New York, where Mayor Bill de Blasio has made affordable housing a centerpiece of his agenda. But his San Francisco counterpart, Mayor Ed Lee, seemed at least partly satisfied with Airbnb, saying it's back taxes payment showed the company 'embraces the values of its hometown and the importance of being a good corporate citizen.' 'This will mean millions of dollars today and going forward in revenue for the city to fund affordable housing, public safety and other vital city services,' he was quoted by the Chronicle as saying.","City Treasurer refuses to reveal how much he collected from the firm .

"Penalties: NHS medical director Sir Bruce Keogh, pictured, said surgeons who do not publish their death rates will face punishments . Surgeons who refuse to publish patient death rates will face penalties, a boss at NHS England has said. Patients will be able to compare the success rate of around 5,000 consultants when data relating to procedures  is published on website My NHS this week. But roughly 2,500 surgeons do not publish this information - which provides details including mortality rates and complications in surgery. Some surgeons have warned the move could lead to consultants refusing to take on difficult cases and argue the statistics do not take full account of the circumstances of each operation. Speaking to the Sunday Times, medical director Sir Bruce Keogh warned that those who do not share this information will face penalties. He said that the move could lead to a better understanding of the best treatments. He admitted that the measures have already pushed some surgeons to quit and said that he expected more to do the same. Sir Bruce told the Sunday Times: 'We are looking now at a series of inducements, penalties to force that (publishing death rates). He added: 'We will lose some surgeons. We will, and have as a consequence of this endeavour. 'The other thing that is more likely, and will help with quality, is that those surgeons who are doing just a small number of operations will think, ""I'm not doing that any more"", and they will pass on those operations to their colleagues.' Sir Bruce and health minster Jeremy Hunt will also order hospitals to publish cancer survival rates from next year. Mr Hunt told the paper 'transparency' in data will help improve NHS cancer care. The information – central to Government plans for a more transparent NHS – aims to show patients how well consultants working in a number of specialities across England perform against their peers. Patients can see the number of times a consultant has carried out a procedure, their mortality rates and whether or not they are performing within the ‘expected range’. The initiative aims to 'shine a light on variation and unacceptable practice', NHS officials said at the time. Transparency: Patients will be able to compare the success rate of around 5,000 consultants when data relating to procedures is published on website My NHS this week. (File image) But some doctors argued that publishing individual surgeons’ death rates could lead to doctors turning away ‘high-risk’ cases. Writing in the British Medical Journal earlier this year, Professor Westaby, a consultant cardiac surgeon at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, argues that most deaths are related to ‘team dynamics’ and hospital infrastructure rather than the competence of individual surgeons. The move to publish surgeons' rates seeks to replicate the move four years ago to publish data on the performance of heart surgeons. League tables published last year provided information on specialities including vascular and orthopaedic surgery. Public patient survival rates were said to have dramatically improved after previously restricted data was made available. At the time, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt today vowed to name and shame health service staff who refuse to reveal data of their track record.","Data relating to the work of around 5,000 surgeons will be posted online .

"After more than a year during which he claimed to be shut out by the military bureaucracy, Army Specialist Brent Grommet was reunited with the bomb-sniffing dog injured with him in Afghanistan. Thanks to a Clinton-era law, Grommet, 23, was supposed to be the first in line to adopt Matty, his bomb-sniffing German shepherd K9 unit, when they both returned from Afghanistan in 2013. Instead he spent 16 months fighting cold shoulders from the military and its contractors and searching for a dog that had all but disappeared. Long-lost: Specialist Brent Grommet was reunited Friday with Matty, the German shepherd he served with as a bomb-detecting technician in Afghanistan . The New York Post reports that the soldier and his parents drove  from Fort Campbell, Kentucky, where Grommet is stationed, to South Carolina, after he was told he could take custody of Matty. Grommet stopped 25 feet from the cage where Matty was and hesitated. 'I was a little worried he forgot me,' he later said. But when he called the dog's name and the kennel door was opened, there was no mistaking that Matty remembered his war buddy. 'He jumped all over me,' said Grommet. 'I couldn’t have asked for a better response. I knew then that he remembered me, and truly wanted to be with me.' Grommet had to sign a non-disclosure agreement not to reveal the names of those who were taking care of Matty in South Carolina in order to get him back, the final twist in their strange separation. The two had been together since basic training, and during their deployment to Afghanistan, where they worked to detect explosives, were caught by a roadside bomb blast. Grommet suffered traumatic brain injury, hearing loss and spinal-cord injury, resulting in surgery that has not quite alleviated the chronic pain and PTSD. Still, Grommet had Matty by his side to rely on during the remainder of his tour. When he flew back to the United States, he slept on top of Matty's crate. Long-lost: Grommet says that he and Matty had been separated for 16 months with no word from the Army, leading him to worry someone else had adopted him . When they arrived back in the US, they were separated in accordance with standard Army procedures. Thanks to a law from 2000 known as Robby's Law, which allows a returning handler to adopt his animal if they were injured together during service, Grommet knew he only had to wait to adopt Matty. But after filling out paperwork with K2 Solution, a contractor charged with setting the Army up with service dogs, Grommet kept waiting while worrying someone else had adopted Matty. 'It’s like someone stole your kid in front of you,' Grommet said before Matty's return, 'and there’s nothing you can do about it.' The family began calling around military bases handling K9 units, but found no response to where Grommet's partner had been taken. After a call to Fort Bragg in North Carolina, a civilian tipped the family off to the person they needed to contact: Richard Vargas, then a lieutenant colonel in charge of dog adoptions. 'I adopted the dog out legally, so there’s nothing you can do about it,' Vargas reportedly told Grommet's father Don when he phoned. Brent says that when he himself tried to contact Vargas, they had a 30-second conversation during which Vargas said there was nothing he could do and told him not to call again. It's not clear what finally allowed Grommet and Matty to be reunited, but the dog's return to his former handler has allowed the soldier to try and heal from his mental and physical wounds. 'It’s very hard to be upset around him,' Grommet said. 'He brings a lot of light into everything.'","Specialist Brent Grommet, 23, reunited with Matty, the bomb-sniffing K9 unit he was injured with in Afghanistan, on Friday .

"A painting by New York abstract artist Barnett Newman sold for a record $43.8 million at Sotheby's last night. Onement Vi, a 8.5ft by 10ft dark blue canvas with Newman's distinctive 'zip' running through the centre, was painted in 1953. It is the last of six pieces the artist created for his Onement series. Four of the oil on canvas paintings are now owned by museums. Big impact: Onement VI, by the abstract artist Barnett Newman, has sold for $43 million at Sotheby's . The piece had been expected to sell for between $30 million and $40 million at the auction, which was held in New York. The painting has previously been exhibited at galleries including the Guggenheim Museum in New York and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. However, it has always been owned privately. The seller had bought the piece for a private collection in 2000. Until yesterday, Onement V held the previous auction record for Newman. It sold for $22.4 million last year. Born in 1905, the abstract expressionist Newman was said to have influenced other artists including Mark Rothko, Jackson Pollock and Frank Stella. While he forged his career in the art world, Newman, who died in 1970, worked for his father's company, making men's clothes. Inspirational: Barnett's sculpture Broken Obelisk on display at the Museum of Modern Art, in New York . In its catalogue notes for the painting, Sotheby's says: 'Newman overwhelms and seduces the viewer with the totality of its sensual, cascading washes of vibrant blue coexisting with Newman’s vertical “Sign” of the human presence, his iconic and revolutionary “zip”.' In his later years the artist, praised by Sotheby's as being 'among the most independent and courageous artists of the Twentieth Century', produced a series of steel sculptures. According to Bloomberg, at least five people bid for Onement VI. The eventual buyer was a phone bidder.","Record price at Sotheby's for canvas with New York artist's distinctive 'zip'

"A pair of British artists have created this stunning installation of 9,000 silhouettes on a D-Day Landings beach to mark international Peace Day. The project, named, 'The Fallen' is a tribute to the civilians, German forces and Allies who lost their lives during the Operation Neptune landing on June 6, 1944. The design was the brainchild of Jamie Wardley, 33, and Andy Moss, 50. Together with a team of volunteers the pair travelled to Arromanches beach, Normandy, to create the silhouettes, which were individually drawn into the sand. Moving: The Peace Day tribute is a poignant reminder the thousands who died during Operation Overlord . Concept: According to artists Jamie Wardley, 33, and Andy Moss, 50, the idea behind the piece was to create a visual representation of loss on an unimaginable scale . Those taking part made the shape of a person by putting down a stencil and raking the surface to create a distinctive figure. The shapes were then left to the mercy of the tide which washed away the 'fallen' after around four and a half hours. Speaking of the idea behind the project Wardley said: 'The Fallen is a sobering reminder of what happens when peace is not present. 'The idea is to create a visual representation of what is otherwise unimaginable, the thousands of human lives lost during the hours of the tide during the Second World War Normandy landings. 'People understand that so many lives were lost that day but it's incredibly difficult to picture that number. Sand men: The team of artists and volunteers created 9,000 of the shadows which were eventually reclaimed by the sea . Teamwork: The project was originally made of 60 people, but after locals learned about the tribute they quickly joined in . Lending a hand: By the end of the day it is estimated that 500 people had chipped in to create the stunning beach art . 'You could see the horrific casualty of war when you stood on the cliff looking down at the beach. 'Watching the tide come in and wash the bodies away was symbolic of all the lives lost in all wars, not just during the Normandy Landings.' Veterans and families, including some who have lost loved ones in recent conflicts have been involved in the project. Wardley, who has been working with partner since 2009, said: 'We turned up to the beach with a team of 60 people but by the end we had over 500 people taking part. 'There were people from all over the world who had heard about the event and travelled all the way to France to take part. Unity: Operation Neptune is remembered as one of the great showings of wartime unity as the Allied forced launched their assault on Nazi occupied France . Reclaimed: The installation was designed so that the sea would wash over the bodies and wipe them from the beach in a moving reminder of the tragedy of war . Achievement: Artists Andy Moss, right and Jamie Wardley, left said they hoped their art would remind people of the value of peace. 'There were others who happened to be walking by and wanted to get involved. 'It showed that people from all over totally understood the message behind it and I found it very overwhelming. 'Some people told us that they had lost family in the Second World War and others said they had lost loved ones in Afghanistan and wanted to pay a tribute to them. 'We finished all the stencils at about 7.30pm and everyone gathered and waited for the tide to come in. 'The last silhouette was washed away at about 10pm and it was incredibly moving.""

"Christopher Hammond, head of German at the elite Abbey School, was dismissed because he used his own camera to take the pictures on a school trip . A respected teacher at a prestigious £13,000 pounds-a-year girls' school was sacked for taking hundreds of photographs of a school trip on his own camera, a tribunal heard today. Christopher Hammond, long-standing head of German at the elite Abbey School, was dismissed because he used his own camera to take the pictures rather than following guidelines to use a school-owned device or memory card. While . none of the content of the images was said to be indecent, Mr Hammond . was dismissed following the episode as he had 'failed to follow procedure.' The camera enthusiast deliberately flouted well-known school rules prohibiting such conduct despite previous warnings about his behaviour, the headteacher who dismissed him claimed. Mr Hammond today took his case for unfair dismissal, sex discrimination and age discrimination against the Abbey School, Reading, Berkshire, to an employment tribunal. The school denies the claims. The tribunal heard how Hammond joined the independent school in September 2000 and was dismissed on May 20 2011. As the head of the German languages department he was responsible for organising trips to the European country and also co-ordinated exchange visits with German students. Mr Hammond also ran the school's Duke of Edinburgh award scheme participation and would accompany pupils on expeditions, often in sole charge of groups, the tribunal was told. It was alleged that during a week-long trip to Germany in April 2011 he took 870 photographs of pupils, documenting the trip. Abbey School headmistress Barbara Stanley told the tribunal that safeguarding pupils' personal data was paramount and Mr Hammond's conduct merited dismissal. Barrister Oliver Hyams, representing Mr Hammond, described the former Abbey School teacher as a keen amateur photographer who had  'come quite late to the revolution in digital photography,' adding: 'He was an enthusiast about Germany and going there on trips, the Duke of Edinburgh Award, teaching and photography.' He also said Mr Hammond could appear set in his ways or old-fashioned. Headteacher Mrs Stanley, who qualified as a teacher in 1973, said that schools had to take 'the utmost care' in safeguarding information about pupils. In her evidence to the tribunal in Reading, Berkshire, she said: 'As information technology - digital cameras, the internet and social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter - has evolved, it has become far easier for information such as photographs and videos to be shared. 'As a result, schools must now do everything within their power to ensure that personal data about pupils - including, for example, photographs - are used, stored and transmitted appropriately.' The school has a strict ICT policy for staff which is kept under regular review by deputy head Kathryn Macaulay, said Mrs Stanley, referring to Department for Education guidance stating that photographs taken of pupils for school purposes must be taken and stored on school-owned equipment and never by teachers' own equipment. Mrs Stanley, who has been a headteacher for the last 18 years with 11 of those at The Abbey, said she had suspended Mr Hammond during a phone call on May 4 2011. On the same day she sent a letter to Mr Hammond detailing the allegations against him, which were that he had breached school policies and refused to follow an instruction from his line manager by carrying on taking pictures when told not to. She also contacted the police on the advice of the Local Authority Designated Officer (LADO), she said. Just over a week later, on May 12 2011, Mrs Stanley said she met with Mr Hammond and a trade union representative acting on his behalf. 'There was virtually no factual dispute,' said Mrs Stanley, a former geography teacher. He accepted that he had been provided with a school camera for use on the trip. 'When asked, by his own representative, why he had not used it, he said that he had not brought it with him. 'He accepted that he had taken pictures of pupils on his own camera. He accepted that this was in direct contravention of the school's policies. 'He was an enthusiast about Germany and going there on trips, the Duke of Edinburgh Award, teaching and photography' Oliver Hyams, representing Mr Hammond . 'He accepted that he was aware of the policy, having received updated safeguarding training less than a week before the incident. He accepted that he had downloaded these photographs onto his personal computer. 'He accepted that he had refused to follow Mrs Byrne's instruction to stop taking photographs. 'He accepted that he had breached the acceptable use policy but said he did not see anything wrong with using his own camera.' Mrs Stanley said she thought 'long and hard' before dismissing Mr Hammond, adding: 'I bore in mind that the security and welfare of our pupils is our prime responsibility.' The incident on the school trip in April 2011 was 'not the first or even second incident of this sort,' said Mrs Stanley. 'I consider that it would have been disproportionate to dismiss without giving the claimant a chance to demonstrate that he could follow the policy. 'However, at the time of his dismissal the claimant had been warned on about five occasions not to take photos of school pupils on his own camera over a 12-month period. 'This was despite the fact that the claimant was not only given a school camera to use but knew that all staff had been offered the option of a school memory card for his or her own camera. 'The claimant was warned formally in a meeting with his NASUWT rep on July 5 2010 and again following a disciplinary hearing in December 2010, when he was warned that further incidents could lead to dismissal.' Mr Hammond had received training on child protection and safeguarding, she said, with the last session on April 8 2011 - less than a week before the trip which resulted in his sacking on grounds of gross misconduct. Abbey School (pictured) headmistress Barbara Stanley told the tribunal that safeguarding pupils' personal data was paramount and Mr Hammond's conduct merited dismissal . Mrs Stanley added: 'I accept that it is unlikely that he personally would use these photos to cause harm but that is not the point.' She said Mr Hammond's actions 'made it impossible for us ever to be completely sure he was suitable to work with children', prompting the school to alert the LADO. She also said Mr Hammond had been receiving support as a teacher for several years and had displayed a 'flagrant failure to meet and sustain his targets' in the classroom. 'Many parents had become concerned and a selection of parental complaint letters and emails were submitted,' she added. Mr Hyams told the tribunal Mr Hammond had been a keen photographer for 10 years at the time of the incident. Pictures he had taken were even used by the school in publicity material, he said. Mr Hammond had been provided with a camera from the school as well as an SD memory card and a USB card reader in advance of the trip, said Mr Hyams. The equipment meant that any photographs taken using the camera could be downloaded onto any computer rather than just school machines, meaning the rules made 'no sense in practical terms,' Mr Hyams told Mrs Stanley. She replied: 'It's because not everybody does act honourably that you have to have so many rules and regulations.' Despite this, Mrs Stanley admitted she had given Mr Hammond permission to take photographs of a school trip on his own camera when they were both on a visit to Christmas markets in Aachen in 2010. 'I accept that it is . unlikely that he personally would use these photos to cause harm but . that is not the point.' Abbey School headmistress Barbara Stanley . She told the tribunal: 'We were colleagues on a trip where I was trying to support him. I was there all the time he was with the girls, therefore I knew where the photographs were.' Mrs Stanley added: 'We went through what he should have done and why he should have done it and I told him what he should do next time.' Wearing a smart grey suit over a red jumper and a white shirt with a blue tie, bespectacled Mr Hammond of Canterbury, Kent, looked calm as he listened intently to the proceedings. The Abbey School is a top independent day school for girls with more than 1,000 pupils aged between three years and 18 years old and is based in Kendrick Road, Reading, Berkshire. A total of around 250 staff are employed at the institution. The school, which was founded in 1887 and named after the previous school at The Abbey Gateway in Reading where Pride and Prejudice novelist Jane Austen had been a pupil, was ranked 57th in The Sunday Times top independent schools 2012. Annual fees at the school cost up to £13,290 pounds. The employment tribunal hearing in Reading, Berkshire continues before judge Andrew Gumbiti-Zimuto and is scheduled to last for seven days.","Christopher Hammond, of Abbey School, Reading, 'flouted guidelines'

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott has released the G20's final plan for economic growth, pledging to work with world leaders to deliver real outcomes. In his final address as G20 chair, Mr Abbott on Sunday thanked world leaders for attending the most influential gathering of world leaders in Australian history. He said there had been a strong spirit of cooperation and moments of candour between the leaders, and a commitment to actually implement their 'action plan'. Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott speaks at the conclusion of the G20 summit in Brisbane on Sunday . US President Barack Obama waves before boarding his flight home after attending the G20 Summit . 'We have published these growth strategies so the world can see what we are committed to and the world can hold us to account,' he told reporters in Brisbane. 'People right around the world are going to be better off and that's what it's all about.' The overarching G20 goal was to boost global economic growth by 2.1 per cent by 2018, which if translated would add $2 trillion to economic activity. Barely had the official G20 summary been released, the leaders were already dashing home, with US President Barack Obama in the air after the summit wrapped up on Sunday. President Obama was spotted boarding his helicopter Marine One at Victoria Park in Bowen Hill before arriving at RAAF Base Amberley, south-west of Brisbane on the outskirts of Ipswich to board his Air Force One plane home. While Russian President Vladimir Putin didn't even hang around that long, citing the need to get back to Moscow and catch up on his sleep as he headed to the special G20 airport in Brisbane before proceedings had even finished.

Meanwhile, Mr Abbott said in his final statement that a working session on trade, which he described as one of the most productive of this G20 weekend, had delivered a unanimous agreement that expanding global trade would directly benefit countries and people right around the world. 'Trade is a key driver of growth, perhaps the key driver of growth, and we're focused on domestic reforms to facilitate trade as well as the importance of a strong global trading system.' He also said a global infrastructure hub would be launched in Sydney as part of a wider initiative to address a global $70 trillion gap in infrastructure by 2030. It would be funded by government and private sector contributions, he said. South African Prime Minister Jacob Zuma is farewelled as he departs Brisbane on Sunday .

Energy ministers would meet for the first time early next year to take work forward on a G20 energy efficiency action plan, Mr Abbott said. 'Energy I'm pleased to say is now at the heart of the G20's agenda,' he said. The communique from the Brisbane summit also included specific mention of climate change. Mr Abbott said all leaders had voiced support for strong and effective action to address climate change. 'Our actions will support sustainable development, economic growth and certainty for business and investment and, of course, we will all work constructively towards the climate change conference in Paris next year.'

The G20 leaders committed backed a global crackdown on tax avoidance by multinational companies. 'If banks get into trouble taxpayers should not be bailing them out,' Mr Abbott said. 'And big business must pay its fair share of tax and it must pay its fair share of tax in the jurisdiction where they earned the profits.' It was put to Mr Abbott that there had been some disagreement among leaders on the extent to which climate change featured in the communique, and that US President Barack Obama had argued strongly against the prime minister's position on the use of fossil fuels. Mr Abbott has pledged to work with world leaders to deliver real outcomes . Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott speaks to the media during a press conference at the conclusion of the G-20 summit in Brisbane on Sunday . 'As for coal, without going into the details of who said what to whom and exactly what intervention was about what subject, I should remind everyone that right now there are 1.3 billion people right around the globe who have no access whatsoever to electricity,' Mr Abbott said. 'And not only was the communique drafting process constructive and collegial but the discussion in the room today was very constructive and collegial. 'I just want to make that absolutely crystal clear, that from the very beginning, climate change was in the draft communique.' U.S. President Barack Obama gestures as he answers questions during his news conference on Sunday . President Barack Obama, Tony Abbott and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe shake hands at the start of their meeting at the G-20 Summit in Brisbane on Sunday . The prime minister said labour market reforms were also crucial, of which lifting female participation was the 'principal commitment'. He said that if female participation was closer to male participation in every country of the G20, 'billions if not trillions of dollars in additional growth' would be unlocked. Meanwhile, Brisbanites will soon get their city back as the riot fences are removed and special laws that made it illegal to carry reptiles on some streets expire. Police declared it a triumph, with no major incidents reported from the 6000 officers deployed to patrol the often empty streets in the city's CBD and south bank areas. The mercury soared, with snipers atop Brisbane rooftops reporting extreme temperatures beyond 60 degrees Celsius. Protests were numerous, colourful, but peaceful. Inside the giant Brisbane convention centre, 3000 journalists from across the globe bunkered down to cover the G20 proceedings. In the end the business side of the two-day spectacle was distilled into an unassuming three-page communique.

Barely had the official G20 summary been released and the leaders were already dashing home . President Barack Obama, Tony Abbott and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at their meeting on Sunday . The world leaders also discussed the fight against the terrororist group ISIS as well as the Ebola epidemic . The overarching goal is to achieve more than two per cent economic growth in the bloc above business as usual by 2018. The real test will be whether countries come good on their promises, but that's really for the next G20 host - Turkey - to oversee. There were also commitments to crackdown on tax avoidance, bolster financial markets from shocks and shore up the banks deemed 'too big to fail'. But despite the Abbott government's wish for a narrow agenda under its G20 presidency, there was much more to the G20 than just jobs and growth. Climate change and the Ebola outbreak were hot topics, dominating talks on the sidelines of the main event.

"A distraught widow is begging callous thieves who stole her dead husband's ashes to return them back to her. Dede Thomason stored her dead husband's ashes inside a white plastic box which she placed into a locked safe in her Marysville, Washington home. But the widow was horrified when thieves ripped the 400-pound safe up from the ground and made off with the ashes and other valuables last month. Loss: Dede Thomason was storing her dead husband's ashes inside a box that she placed in a safe . Bolts: Thieves ripped up the 400-pound safe and made off with the ashes and other valuables last month . Death: The thieves stole a box with the ashes of Clint Thomason, seen here, before his death . Thomason  told KOMO-TV in Seattle: ‘I don't think [the thieves] had any idea that's what they were taking. 'But once they realized it, I think they should've found a way to get those back.’ She added: ‘We just want him back!' Thieves broke down the large metal door to her garage on October 5, but did not trigger the house's alarm. Once inside, they not only stole her husband Clint's ashes but also grabbed precious jewels like Thomason's engagement ring and her grandmother’s engagement ring. Thomason and her husband  were married for 27 years and met in high school. They brought up two children together and lived in the house on 114th Street NE. But after Clint died suddenly at the age of 52, she was forced to sell their house. She decided to  store her  valuables  - including family heirlooms and documents - in the safe  while people viewed the property. She was using a simple white box to store  Clint's ashes in until she could find a more suitable urn. She was convinced that the safe would be a secure location to put all of these things in because it was bolted down to the ground in her locked garage. She soon realized that she was wrong. Death: Clint died suddenly at the age of 52, his death forced the mom-of-two to sell their house . Home: Thomason  stored her valuables in the safe while people viewed the property, seen here, . Thomason said: ‘It's just total devastation. It's just - everything that you had that you deemed precious was in that safe.’ Her family photos were gone, so were birth certificates, gift cards, old letters, cameras, a television set and Clint's remains. A day after the burglary, detectives identified a person of interest who was seen selling some of the items at an Everett pawn shop. But when questioned, they denied that the items were stolen. However, an employee at the store also found Clint's credit cards in the parking lot the same day. Garage: She was convinced that the safe was secure  because it was bolted down to the garage floor seen here, . ‘I feel like I failed,’ she said. ‘I failed to keep him safe, because that's my responsibility.’ The family found large bolt cutters inside the garage, which were likely used to help pry the safe from the floor. The value of the stolen items exceeds $40,000. An investigation is ongoing. In happier times: Thomason said she feels like she failed to keep her husband's ashes safe since the burglary .","Dede Thomason was storing her dead husband's ashes inside a safe .

"I am standing outside an innocuous white door set in an entirely white building on the island of Ibiza. It hardly seems the setting for the most expensive restaurant in the world. But I am told it is the magic inside that justifies Sublimotion’s £1,250 per head price tag. This is the newest restaurant from two-Michelin star Spanish chef Paco Roncero - Spain’s version of experimental chef Heston Blumenthal - and I am among the first people in the world invited to sample its unusual concept. Scroll down for video . A work of theatre: Sublimotion is part of the brand new Hard Rock Hotel in Ibiza, which celebrated its grand opening this weekend with a huge open-air beach concert . The meal is like an immersive theatre experience and the food hugely enjoyable. The owners stand by the price, they say the cost of setting up the restaurant, the quality of the food and the 27 staff for a dozen diners explains the price. The also know that people will pay that for the latest dining experience in Ibiza. The eatery - which seats just 12 people at a time - is part of the brand new Hard Rock Hotel, which celebrated its grand opening this weekend with live performances at its open-air, beachside concert space from disco king Nile Rodgers and garage stars Masters at Work. We are promised that our taster at Sublimotion will be a work of theatre - appealing to every one of our senses and transporting us to another world. While some may shudder at the price tag, celebrities and wealthy holidaymakers are already queuing up for bookings. After a special coded knock, we are invited through the white door to a tiny room, with little more than a few artfully-placed boxes and a giant nitrogen tank - a key ingredient in many of Roncero’s dishes. Roncero's rose: Food is served with a flourish, one course even sees diners making their own Bloody Mary cocktails using test tubes . In a flash, the opaque window in front of us becomes transparent, giving us a glimpse of the 27 staff working in the kitchen to create the 20-course meal that is served up over a two-and-a-half hour ‘performance’ in the restaurant. Then all goes dark. We are led into a old metal lift that - with the help of screens, lights and simulators - gives us the impression of plunging down below ground as music blares all around us. It feels a bit like a Disneyland ride, guests giggling nervously, wondering what on earth comes next. We emerge into an all-white room with a white table and padded white chairs, with our names are beamed onto the table as place settings. Beautiful backdrop: Light and laser effects create different worlds, including this one featuring Paris' Arc de triomphe,  to accompany each dish . Ambiance: The temperature in the room,  the humidity and even the smells can be altered to suit each dish, along with the musical accompaniment . Two waitresses are dressed as air stewardesses, there is a compere who will introduce our dishes to us and light and laser effects create different worlds to accompany each separate dish. Roncero wants the exact tricks of the trade to remain a secret, but needless to say, the white surfaces of the room don’t stay white for long as different settings and videos are beamed onto them, creating a backdrop for the plates and other unusual crockery put in front of us. Food is served with a flourish. We make our own Bloody Mary cocktails using test tubes presented to us in a giant book. Nitrogen-frozen olive oil is added to bread and tomato in an unusual modern twist on the traditional Spanish dish pan con tomate, and separate olive oil parcels are presented to us suspended on a mini washing line - complete with pegs. Presentation is everything: As well as serving up food in nitrogen clouds and novelty crockery, the ever-changing decor takes diners to another level . My favourite dish is a sweet dessert served up on a spinning, levitating plate, which eventually slows down enough to allow me to eat it. So out there is the presentation of the food, all wispy nitrogen clouds and bizarre concoctions that mean you don’t know what you’re eating until it is in our mouth, that I keep half an eye on the door expecting Roncero to make an appearance dressed as Willy Wonka, the deranged chocolate producer in Roald Dahl’s Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Roncero later explains to me that while he has always been interested in what’s on the plate, he wanted to explore diners’ surroundings and complete the meal experience appealing to every one of our senses. The temperature in the room, the humidity and even the smells can be altered to suit each dish, along with the musical accompaniment. Our 12-person party switches from awed silence to stifled giggles and even applause as our food is presented. Worth £1,250? The owners say yes, but it will probably be a haunt for celebrities and playboys rather than the average Ibiza holidaymaker . I am not lucky enough to be treated to all 20 dishes, but even my six-dish taster takes almost an hour to ‘perform’, before we spill out onto a sunny terrace to remind us that we are indeed in Ibiza and not underground in a crazy science laboratory. Just hours after my experience, the restaurant is fully booked by millionaire racers from the Gumball Rally, which has just finished its 3,000-mile odyssey across the globe from Miami, via New York, Edinburgh, London, Paris and Barcelona. Is it worth the £1,250 price tag? Spend 10 minutes talking to Roncero and you will say yes. His passion and explanations about the food and how it is prepared are inspiring. He truly is Spain’s Heston Blumenthal. But this restaurant is hardly going to be attracting the average Ibiza holidaymaker. Set in the five-star Hard Rock hotel - the largest luxury resort on the island - on the beach Playa d’en Bossa, which has become synonymous with Europe’s millionaire party scene, I predict Sublimotion will be packed out with celebrities and playboys for most of its summer season.

"Promoting her latest Peter Rabbit book, Emma Thompson said she no longer supported Labour and admitted her daughter goes to a private school . She has been a renowned supporter of left-wing politics. But when it comes to educating her daughter, it seems Emma Thompson is prepared to put her political leanings on the back burner. The actress has revealed she sends 14-year-old Gaia – her child with husband Greg Wise – to a north London private school instead of entrusting her education to the state. Once Gaia turns 16, her mother hopes to enrol her at a state school near their home in West Hampstead – however even that will be one of the UK’s most elite establishments. Miss Thompson told The Times: ‘We’re not in the catchment area for Camden School for Girls, but she might go there for the sixth form.’ The 55-year-old, who is said to be worth £30million, was educated at the school herself when it was still a grammar. It has long been a favourite of wealthy left-wing parents who can afford to live in its expensive catchment area, and inspectors regularly describe it as ‘outstanding’. Scroll down for video . Other alumni include actress Tamsin Greig and the children of several Blairite cabinet ministers. If Gaia does get in, it may improve her chances of being accepted by an elite university like her mother, who studied at Cambridge. In recent years, ministers have encouraged admissions tutors to accept lower grades from state pupils if they show more ‘potential’ than their private school counterparts. Thompson is regularly accompanied by her 14-year-old daughter Gaia at red carpet events . Camden School for Girls: Thompson went there but has chosen to send her daughter to a private school . The actress hit out at US President Barack Obama for not 'changing things' and Tony Blair for 'accruing wealth' Miss Thompson – who also has a 27-year-old adopted son Tindy – also used her interview to call for a ‘revolution’ to fix the world’s social and political problems. And despite being pictured in a ‘celebrity selfie’ with Ed Miliband at a Labour drinks reception earlier this year, she said she is now so disillusioned by politics that she ‘cannot support any of it’. She said: ‘I don’t think this is working, everybody! I’m in a red-hot phase of meltdown. We’re going to have to have a revolution.’ Thompson reserved praise for millionaire comedian Russell Brand, right, seen with his heiress former girlfriend, Jemima Khan .

"When it comes to Pokemon the aim is to collect them all but one fan has taken this to the extreme. Lisa Courtney realy has trid to live up to the 'gotta catch em' all' tagline and is the owner of the world's largest Pokemon collection, with more than 16, 000 pieces of the Japanese memorabilia. The 26-year-old has been a Pokemon fan from a young age and has been collecting and storing the trinkets for the past 17 years. Scroll down for video . Lisa Courtney owns the world's largest collection of Pokemon memorabilia . Lisa's fixation started at the age of nine when she saw a picture of the cartoon's protagonist, Pikachu in a Nintendo magazine. Lisa, who lives in Hertfordshire, has thousands of the cartoon's famous collectible trading cards but her obsession doesn't end there. Lisa's room is full to bursting with hundreds of the anime cuddly toys, models, clothing, badges, flannels and posters. Lisa's collection of the Nintendo franchise has grown so large that her mother Sharon, whom she lives with, had to move from the largest to the smallest room in their house to make room for the possessions. Lisa's collection consists of over 16000 pieces including thousands of trading cards and hundreds of cuddly toys . Lisa has held the Guinness World Record for the largest collection of Pokemon memorabilia since 2009 when she had 12,113 items but that hasn't stopped her from collecting more. The devoted fan even traveled to Japan when the eleventh Pokemon movie was released to get hold of exclusive merchandise that wasn't available in Europe. 'With the help of my late grandparents, I visited Japan for my 21st birthday. Lisa has been collecting the anime items since the age on nine and has no plans of stopping soon . Lisa has scoured the Internet for unusual items such as these Heinz spaghetti shapes . 'I went for the release of the eleventh Pokemon movie in an attempt to get some exclusive Shaymin merchandise - it was amazing.' Despite having to sacrifice her bedroom, Lisa's mum and the rest of her family are very supportive of her obsession and even buy her more items for special occasions. Lisa's mum and grandmother had to order Lisa's first toy from overseas because Pokemon had not yet hit the UK. Lisa has even travelled to Japan in search of rarer memorabilia . 'The first toy I ever got was a large Psyduck plush toy from Japan - my mother and grandmother ordered it from a mail order company before Pokemon hit the UK. 'We had to guess what we were ordering because the names of the Pokemon hadn't even been translated into English yet.' For Lisa Pokemon isn't simply a cartoon, the programme really helped her through a very difficult stage of her life. Lisa's mother had to move to the smallest room in the house in order to make room for her daughter's collection . Lisa started collecting when she was being bullied at school, she says Pokemon was the only thing that made her happy . 'I started collecting when I was getting bullied at school, Pokemon was the only thing that made me feel happy.' She now spends seven hours a week on the internet browsing for new Pokemon releases to buy and trade, she also visits car-boot sales and charity shops at weekends hunting for rare memorabilia to add to her collection. 'I try and get new merchandise as soon as the new characters come out - it's often difficult as they are only available in Japan and America or are too expensive.' Lisa spends seven hours a week surfing the Internet in search of new Pokemon releases . Despite trying to save money where  she can Lisa does own one particular item that she is sure must be worth a fortune. 'My most valuable piece is my large Ho-Oh plush toy, it was a prize in Japan, only available in raffles and in their amusement arcades. 'Only 100 were ever made but I bought mine for £60 online - it's probably worth several times that now. 'My favourite piece is my Absol PokeDoll, who I nickname 'Hiei' after a character from one of my favourite shows. Despite her mammoth collection Lisa has no plans to slow her obsession any time soon. 'I will always collect Pokemon, I will never stop, there's always something new to get.'","Lisa Courtney started her collection at the age of nine after severe bullying .

"The last words of a New South Wales homicide detective who took his own life while suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder have been revealed. Former detective sergeant Ashley Bryant served in the police service for 23 years but quit in December 2012 after many attempts to overcome the traumas he had experienced on the job. A year later, Mr Bryant was at Minyon Falls - in NSW's Northern Rivers region - making his last call to 000 before he ended his life. Former detective sergeant Ashley Bryant served in the police service for 23 years but quit in December 2012 after many attempts to overcome the traumas he had experienced on the job . Even in his final moments, the former police officer who dedicated his life to saving others tried to prevent more  from being lost. In a recording played on Channel Seven's Sunday Night, Mr Bryant asked the operator to listen to him and made a plea to authorities to do more for those who suffered from PTSD. 'I understand that this is being recorded and I suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. I can no longer live with the trauma of it and I want this to go to the coroner,' he said. The father-of-three added more needed to also be done for the partners of police officers who suffered from the mental health illness. Mr Bryant's wife Deborah has called for more support for officers who suffered mental illness - in particular PTSD . The couple met when Ms Bryant was 22 years old and they had three children together . The operator asks him if he can hold off until emergency services arrived but Mr Bryant said he could not, replying: 'I'll be gone before they arrive.' NSW Police Minister Stuart Ayres told the news program in a written statement that the welfare of officers remained 'one of my highest priorities'. But Mr Bryant's wife Deborah, who played the recording to reporter Melissa Doyle in an emotional interview, has called for more support for officers who suffered mental illness - in particular PTSD. Ms Bryant said her husband - who recruited to Unsolved Homicide Team in 2007 - saw many things on the job which led to the deterioration of his mental health. Mr Bryant (pictured here with Ms Bryant on their wedding day) ended his life in December 2013 . But she said it took him years before he sought help because he did not want to seem like he was not coping with the demands of the job. 'In the early days, there was always incidents he would come home obviously very affected... whether it be motor vehicle accidents or self-harm,' Ms Bryant told Sunday Night. 'It was really heartbreaking to see that strong person become a shell of himself.' When Ashley Bryant finally sought help in January 2012, he was diagnosed with PTSD and was prescribed anti-depressants and sleeping pills. Despite a three-week stint in a rehabilitation clinic, the proud detective made the tough choice to walk away from his two-decade long career with the police service. But Mr Bryant's story is not an isolated one. According to Sunday Night, one in five NSW police officers are suffering from PTSD and in the past two years there have been five times more deaths in police officers as a result of taking their own life than those on duty. But Mr Bryant's case is not the only one. Allan Sparkes said he had also contemplated taking his own life but after a decade of therapy he no longer suffers from PTSD . While Jeff Garland is still suffering from the disorder after five years on the job . Allan Sparkes is a former police officer who has contemplated suicide after the 1978 Hilton Hotel bombing in Sydney, which killed three people, and the double murder of two colleagues in 1995. The final straw for Mr Sparkes was the rescue of a boy who was trapped in a manhole during flooding in 1996, which earned him and his partner crosses of valour. But the screams of the young child - who almost died that day - haunted him from that day forward and led to him to contemplate taking his own life. Luckily for Mr Sparkes, he was able to get help and overcome the disorder after a decade of therapy. Similar circumstances also led to Jeff Garland quitting the force after five years. In 2001, he was involved in a high speed pursuit where he was trapped on the back of a ute while trying to capture a suspect. 'I thought I'm going to die here,' Mr Garland said. This was not the first incident he had faced and the culmination of the trauma of these events led to his mental health deteriorating. 'I'd go to work and sit in my car and cry. I'd be late for work... because I couldn't do it anymore,' Mr Garland said. NSW Police Minister Stuart Ayres said he was 'committed' to improving the welfare of officers and the state government had invested $15 million in 'welfare-focused programs', including PTSD. 'The NSW Police Force now has over 79 activities and initiatives in place to promote wellbeing and prevent injury, improve injury management, and rehabilitate and redeploy injured officers,' Mr Ayres said. Specific programs for those with PTSD included mental health intervention team, 24-hour trauma support and a peer support program managed by a psychologist, and new deployment guidelines and psychological job analysis tools for injured officers. Those needing help or someone to speak to, can call Lifeline (Australia) on 131 114, the Suicide Prevention Lifeline (U.S.) on 1-800-273-8255 or Samaritans (U.K.) on 08457 90 90 90.","Former police detective Ashley Bryant had post-traumatic stress disorder .

"Queen Victoria's relationship with her devoted ghillie John Brown 150 years ago set tongues wagging from the grand hallways of Buckingham Palace to the servants’ quarters at Balmoral. But while rumours that the pair were lovers endure to this day, a top historian has now claimed that they never had sex. The monarch's biographer, AN Wilson, believes that the couple 'hugged one another and slept together' but that the relationship was never consummated. Man and wife: Queen Victoria and her servant John Brown, pictured together, were married but never consummated their relationship, her biographer, AN Wilson, claimed in a new BBC programme . He said: 'I don't believe Queen Victoria had full sexual relations with Brown. I do believe they had a little marriage ceremony at Crathie Kirk, which the minister confessed to on his deathbed.' The historian made the statement in the first installment of Queen Victoria's Letters: A Monarch Unveiled, a two-part series he is presenting on BBC Four. John Brown, who was seven years Victoria's junior, is best remembered today thanks to the acclaimed 1997 film Mrs Brown, starring Dame Judi Dench and Billy Connolly. The strapping 6ft ghillie was brought south from his post at Balmoral to become Victoria's personal groom at Osborne - her house on the Isle of Wight - following her husband's death. On film: The couple portrayed by Judi Dench and Billy Connolly in acclaimed 1997 movie Mrs Brown . Her courtiers were pleased at first that Brown was able to coax her out of her misery but they soon became concerned that she had fallen utterly under his spell. Brown immediately adopted a bullying and familiar manner with her that astonished courtiers and caused the Queen’s daughters to refer to him as ‘Mama’s lover’. He became increasingly high-handed, and soon the rest of the royal household came to loathe him. Other servants snidely dubbed Brown ‘the Queen’s stallion'. Brown encouraged her to drink whisky with him. Begg’s Best was their preferred tipple. She was soon referring to the hirsute Highlander as ‘fascinating Johnny Brown’. A shocked Foreign Secretary, the Earl of Derby, recorded that they slept in adjoining rooms ‘contrary to etiquette and even decency’. The first anti-Brown propaganda, claiming that he was the Queen’s ‘morganatic husband’ (married but with the stipulation that he would have no claim on any title), appeared in pamphlets circulated by the Scottish socialist republican nationalist Alexander Robertson. Victoria began to address Brown as ‘Darling’ in her letters to him, and it was some claimed that during a trip to Loch Ordie, ‘Hochmagandy’ — the old Scottish word for sexual intercourse — had taken place. There are those who believe that the pair went on to have a child together, but suggestions that a child was born nine months later in Switzerland are untenable. Edgar Boehm, the sculptor, who spent several months at Balmoral sculpting a head of John Brown for Victoria and observed them both at close quarters, later told Catherine Walters (one of Edward VII’s mistresses) that Victoria allowed Brown ‘every conjugal privilege’. Further evidence may have existed in the affectionate memoir Victoria wrote about John Brown after his death in 1883. But her senior courtiers refused to let her publish it, fearing that it would further damage her reputation, and had it destroyed, together with Brown’s own diaries. But there are those who disagree with the claim that the pair shared a romantic relationship. Intimate: Victoria began to addressed Brown, above, as ‘Darling’ in her letters, and it was some claimed that during a trip to Loch Ordie, ‘Hochmagandy’ — the old Scottish word for sexual intercourse — had taken place . Close: The strapping ghillie was brought south from Balmoral to become Victoria's personal groom at Osborne, her house on the Isle of Wight, following her husband's death. Above, a painting of the pair . Irish author J.H. Brennan claimed in her book that the reason Queen Victoria kept her strapping servant so close was because he 'channelled the spirit' of her late husband. She argued that the Queen’s senior courtiers went to great lengths to keep the seances she held with Brown secret, fearing news of them would lead to rumours that the Queen had lost her Christian faith, or even her sanity. Another biographer of Queen Victoria, the late Lady Elizabeth Longford, concluded that Victoria and Brown had a platonic relationship.","Queen Victoria's close relationship with John Brown caused controversy .

"From a distance, it looks like a small, white patch of sea surrounded by a series of dark lines. But up close, it appears to be the wreckage of a ship lying off the coast of Boston, Massachusetts. Or at least, that's what Reddit users - who discovered the image on Google Earth - believe. One user uploaded the photo to the social media platform on Saturday, alongside the title: 'Found on Google Earth just off the runway of Logan International Airport. Looks like it might be a shipwreck.' Mystery: Could this  photo, from Google Earth, show a shipwreck off the coast of Boston, Massachusetts? Others were quick to voice their opinions on the image, which in accordance with the virtual map's measurement tool, appears to show an object around 100 feet long and 30 feet wide. Many agreed that it looked like a shipwreck, but could not work out what type of vessel it was. However, some argued that the picture simply showed the remains of a 'large pier'. The alleged wreckage is located just off what was formerly known as Boston's Governors Island, formerly the site of Fort Winthrop, a defensive fortification named after Governor John Winthrop. Gov Wintrhop's family, which was granted the island in 1632, owned it until 1808, when it was acquired for the fort's construction. It was later reclaimed for the extension of Logan International. Off the coast: The image - featuring a white rectangular shape surrounded by lines - was posted to Reddit . Location: Users were quick to voice their opinions on the photo, which appears to show an object around 100 feet long and 30 feet wide. Above, the location of the alleged shipwreck, near Logan International Airport . If the shipwreck is authentic, the vessel could have crashed during the early 1900s, some Redditors suggested. In this period, a number of since-retrieved ships reportedly went down in the area. One user, dubbed Scipio, posted a copy of 'Report of the Chief of Engineers U.S. Army' on the site. The report contains a reference to a schooner, 'Mary', which crashed near the island in 1888. 'The government paid to haul her to Fort Winthrop so it wouldn't interfere with harbor traffic,' ScipioA wrote on Reddit, according to The Daily Dot. Poplar social media platform: The user who originally posted the Google Earth image titled it: 'Found on Google Earth just off the runway of Logan International Airport. Looks like it might be a shipwreck' 'The fort was abandoned only a few years after the ship was moved, so perhaps nobody cared enough to do anything with the hulk and there she sits.' Is is unclear whether authorities have been informed of the apparent wreck.","Photo, captured on Google Earth, was uploaded to Reddit on Saturday .

"A victim of the VIP paedophile abuse scandal claims he saw a Conservative MP murder a young boy at one of their sick orgies. Detectives are investigating three murders linked to the child sex ring, it was reported last night, days after the Metropolitan Police revealed they had launched a probe into a killing connected to the historical abuse. A victim of the sickening sex parties says he was in the same room as a boy, aged 12, was strangled by a Tory MP. A victim of the VIP paedophile abuse scandal claims he saw a Conservative MP murder a young boy at one of their sick orgies (file picture) The boy, known as Nick, told the Sunday People: 'I watched while that happened. I am not sure how I got out of that. Whether I will ever know why I survived, I am not sure.' Now a grown man, he has also told detectives that he saw a 10 or 11-year-old deliberately run over by a car. As well as this, Nick claims he saw two unknown men murder a third boy in front of another MP 18 months later. Nick said that he and another abuse victim were taken in a chauffeur-driven car to a luxury townhouse in central London 'to be sexually abused by powerful men'. Still traumatised by the harrowing events, he gave a graphic description to police of what took place inside the building. He said: 'The MP was particularly nasty, even among the group of people who sexually abused me and others. I still find it difficult to talk about these incidents after all these years.' Nick alleges several high-placed individuals abused him and other boys at Dolphin Square (pictured) Nick also told detectives about the death of another boy during a sexual assault in front of a Conservative minister - different to the one involved in the first killing. Nick says his father handed him over to the VIP abusers at Dolphin Square in Pimlico, near the Houses of Parliament, as well as other London locations. Dolphin Square was last week named as one of the locations where abuse was carried out by powerful individuals. He says he was raped over and over again by the minister, who also sexually assaulted other boys who were younger than 14 years old. His claims are being investigated by police under Operation Midland, part of Operation Fairbank - the large scale investigation into allegations of abuse by high-placed public figures. A statement from the Metropolitan Police said: 'Detectives from the child abuse investigation command are working closely with colleagues from homicide and major crime ­concerning this information.' September and October 2012: Jimmy Savile abuse scandal breaks. October 2012: Labour MP Tom Watson claims at Prime Minister’s Questions there is ‘clear intelligence suggesting a powerful paedophile network linked to Parliament and No 10’ and that a ‘senior aide to a former prime minister’ had links to a child sex gang member.

The Mail reveals Peter Hatton-Bornshin – allegedly abused there as a teenager – killed himself in 1994, aged 28. December 2013: Ex-Labour MP Lord Janner’s home searched by police investigating historical child sex abuse. He is not arrested. June 2014: Lord Janner’s Westminster offices searched by police. Again, he is not arrested. July 3, 2014: It emerges Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens’ dossier on suspected Establishment paedophiles – sent to then Home Secretary Leon Brittan in 1983 – disappeared. But the Home Office could find no record of it, fuelling claims of a cover-up. Lord Brittan amends his story twice over his dealings with the original document. July 5, 2014: More than ten current and former politicians reported to be on list of alleged child abusers held by police investigating Westminster paedophile ring claims.

"The amount of young Australians suntanning has almost halved in the past ten years, according to new research. Cancer Council's National Sun Protection Survey has found 38 per cent of young Australians aged 12 to 17 years old like to get a sun tan compared to 60 per cent a decade ago. The council's chief executive officer Professor Ian Olver said the results were encouraging and most teens no longer viewed the 'bronzed Aussie' as something to aspire to. Cancer Council's National Sun Protection Survey has found 38 per cent of young Australians aged 12-17 years like to get a sun tan compared to 60 per cent a decade ago . But the study also showed teens were still not doing enough to protect themselves from the sun, with 23 per cent of teenagers reporting they were getting sunburnt on summer weekends. Professor Olver said this figure had not shown 'significant' change since 2003-04, with the number of teenagers reporting getting sunburnt in 2013-14 dropping only one per cent compared to 10 years ago. A total of 6,349 Australians were interviewed, including 1,061 adolescents aged 12 to 17, and they were surveyed over the three months of last summer. Breaking the figures down by gender, females were more likely to suntan than males across all age groups. In 2003-04, 54 per cent of men said they liked to get a suntan but that figure had dropped to 31 per cent in 2013-14. But in women, this figure was 47 per cent in 2013-14 compared to 66 per cent in 2003-04. Breaking the figures down by gender, females were more likely to suntan than males . The research, which was released on Monday, coincides with National Skin Cancer Action Week. The week started on Sunday and runs until Saturday, and aims to remind young people to look after their skin cancer and take steps to make sure they are protected properly from the sun. Professor Olver said although two in three Australians would be diagnosed with skin cancer by age 70, adolescents underestimated their skin cancer risk, with one in two rating their chances of developing skin cancer as 'low'. 'It's wonderful to see teens understanding that a tan isn't the hallmark of health it was once made out to be,' he said. 'However, while most don't actively seek a tan, we do want them to actively protect themselves. 'Skin cancer doesn't have to be an inevitability. Take the recommended sun protection measures and the odds of preventing it are in your favour.' Former Australian Olympian Stephanie Rice is supporting this year's campaign after being a spokeswoman for last year's Despicable Me 2 Sun Safety campaign run by the Melanoma Institute . The Australian College of Dermatologists are also getting behind the week. Dermatologist Dr Patricia Lowe reminded young people that getting to know their skin was an important part of being sun safe. 'Make a habit of keeping an eye on your skin and getting to know what ""normal"" is for you,' she said. 'It doesn't take long and it can make the difference between early detection and not knowing until it's too late. 'If you notice any changes, see your doctor because early detection of skin cancer almost always means it can be successfully treated.' Former Australian Olympian Stephanie Rice is supporting this year's campaign and has urged young people to take their skin health more seriously to reap the long-term benefits. 'I've grown up outdoors and in the water and loved every bit of it but you have to be smart,' she said. 'Skin cancer can almost be considered our national cancer, yet it's so preventable. 'When you're heading out, slip, slop, slap, seek and slide and make your summer a safe one.' This year’s theme of 'Your Summer. Your Skin. Your Story.' aims to raise awareness of the harsh effects of skin cancer while encouraging Australians to share their personal skin cancer stories and how it has impacted their lives.","Figures showed females were 16 per cent more likely to suntan than males .

"The parents of a four-year-old girl who is allergic to school dinners say she is being forced to eat her packed lunch in an 'isolation room'. The head teacher of Salusbury Primary School in Harlesden, north west London, allegedly told Lisa-Mbali McFarlane's parents it was 'anti-social' to eat her allergen-free meal around other pupils. Free hot meals are compulsory for younger years, and Lisa's parents are now embroiled in a row with the school over the bizarre situation - which they have branded ridiculous. Scroll down for video . Isolation: Four-year-old Lisa-Mbali McFarlane with her mother Gina Wolhunter, her father Axel McFarlane and her pink packed lunch. They claim she has been made to eat in isolation to avoid being 'anti-social' Her mother Gina Wolhunter, a 36-year-old dance instructor, said: 'I couldn’t believe my ears. Why on Earth is it anti-social for my daughter to eat different food? 'We have a legitimate reason to not want her to eat school dinners. Her intolerances and allergies are still unclear, but we know which foods to keep her away from. 'I don’t think there’s anything wrong with school dinners there as a whole, but they are wrong for my daughter.' Ms Wolhunter and Lisa's father Axel McFarlane, a plumber, say they are still going through the process of full allergy-testing for their daughter, whose problems began aged one. That means they do not know the full extent of her allergies or what could be causing them. However, they say she reacts the worst to sugar, dairy and artificial additives such as monosodium glutamate. Mr McFarlane said: 'Our eight-year-old son Khwezi goes to Salusbury and he eats school lunches. Row: The parents are in a dispute with Salusbury Primary School in Harlesden, north west London . 'It’s not the composition of the meals we have a problem with - it’s the mandatory nature of the school’s policy. 'If Lisa eats something that disagrees with her, she ends up with a horrific, hacking cough for as long as a week. Children can develop one of hundreds of food allergies including milk, eggs, wheat, nuts, seeds and shellfish - with reactions ranging from a skin rash to vomiting and anaphylaptic shock. Allergies to food additives such as E-numbers are relatively uncommon compared to those to milk and nuts. Nut allergies are among the most common, afflicting up to one in 50 children according to the NHS. Despite many outlets offering allergy tests, the charity Allergy UK claims this is not the best way to find out which foods are causing the problem. The organisation says the 'gold standard' is to draw up strict diets and stick to them while keeping a detailed diary of symptoms. 'The cough sounds very painful too - why ever would we want to put our daughter through that? 'Now they’re effectively giving her a lunchtime detention, punishment for eating something different. It’s not on.' The couple say head teacher Linda Kiernan spoke to them on the first day of term last month and insisted Lisa would have to eat school meals because it was 'anti-social' to have different food. After weeks of rowing, the family say they came to a tentative agreement where Lisa eats in a separate room accompanied by one other pupil and the school nurse. Mr McFarlane: 'We allowed her to have just one ice-cream from the van this summer, because she said she wanted to be like all her friends. 'For a week afterwards she was up all night coughing, and her eczema flared up.' The school provides free lunches to all children in the first three years as part of a flagship scheme by Nick Clegg, who said it would help improve concentration and raise learning standards. Pupils in other years have the option of either eating school dinners or bringing in their own packed lunch, as long as it conforms to school health guidelines. The school introduced free hot meals for the youngest three years thanks to a policy by Nick Clegg (pictured) Ms Wolhunter added: 'Our son chooses whether he wants dinner or a packed lunch, and every time we make it for him, we have to conform to a series of very sensible nutritional guidelines. 'The school has banned chocolate, crisps and fizzy drinks, for example, which I think is absolutely fair enough.' Salusbury Primary School's head teacher declined to comment on the parents' claims earlier today. Mr McFarlane said: 'We are not food hippy parents, forcing our kids to only eat a vegan, whole food diet. We want to choose what our food-intolerant daughter eats, because she’s too young to control it herself. 'We have a legitimate reason - we’re not just being contrary for the sake of it.'","Lisa-Mbali McFarlane has rashes and cough when she eats certain foods .

"If ever anyone had a justified case for having road rage it has to be this truck driver in Victoria who avoided what could have been a fatal accident, not once, but twice, when a reckless driver careered into his path. As if to prove the theory that you can't make something idiot-proof, because someone will eventually come along and invent a new idiot, having escaped death once the dim-witted driver then speeds down the left-hand side of the truck and back into the way again. The truck driver was forced into taking evasive action for a second time seconds after avoiding the initial head on collision. Scroll down for video . A black Mazda 3 hatchback smashes through a fence from out of nowhere and onto the highway . 9News showed the shocking near miss where the black Mazda 3 hatchback drove through a fence from out of nowhere and onto the highway, forcing the truck driver out of his lane to avoid smashing into the other driver. A man known only as Michael was behind the wheel of the tanker, which was doing 100km/h. He just about kept the tanker upright at first, swerving quickly to the right, across the opposite lane and onto the shoulder, before veering back to the left again. But just when Michael thinks the coast is clear, the Mazda cuts down past the left-hand side of the truck, apparently totally oblivious to the carnage he already almost caused. The video was uploaded to Facebook group Dashcam Owners Australia. It was marked 2012, however the driver of the truck told the group that his date stamp was incorrect, and that it actually happened earlier this month. The truck driver can only look on in horror as the car goes into the middle of the road . It was taken about 30km out of Melbourne on the Western Highway, near Rockbank, on Thursday November 6, according to the group. Police were not aware of the incident. There's nothing for it but to take evasive action and swerve around the car to avoid a certain crash . To make matters worse, seconds later the Mazda cuts back down past the left-hand side of the truck .","Tanker going at 100k/h narrowly avoid collisions with reckless driver .

"For years, knitting fanatic Anne Feast has entertained local children with quirky displays of handmade animals in her front window. But when she put a gorilla there, police went, well…bananas. Two police community support officers knocked on her door and told the pensioner there had been a complaint about the ‘black body’, warning her that it was a ‘potentially racially offensive object’. Anne Feast, 70, was questioned on her doorstep about the 'potentially offensive' object, which she explained was a toy she knitted . The grandmother-of-two said that even after she had pointed out that it was merely a knitted gorilla called Cilla, she was asked to take it down – a demand she ignored. But now it appears the officers had invented the complaint, with their force insisting they acted on their own initiative after spotting the toy during a routine patrol. Mrs Feast, 70, said: ‘Two police officers, a man and a woman, knocked on the door at about 7.30pm. ‘They told me they needed to speak to me about the “black body” hanging in my window. ‘I said “Pardon? Do you mean the baby gorilla?” to which they replied “Ah, that’s what it is, is it?”. They said the gorilla had offended a passer-by and that I needed to take it down. ‘I told them there was no way I was taking it down and to be honest I basically closed the door in their face. I was so shocked.’ PCSOs decided to investigate after spotting what they thought was a 'black body' in Ely, Cambridgeshire . She added: ‘I wish I’d asked them what the person had found so offensive but I was too angry. I presume it was either the way she was hanging or the fact Cilla is black, both of which are, quite frankly, pathetic. ‘The police haven’t been back since and everyone I’ve told can’t believe it. 'I can’t believe someone would be so sad as to take offence to a woollen toy, let alone reporting it to police. I’m sure the police have more important things to worry about.’ Mrs Feast knits as a hobby and has two suitcases full of her creations. She always keeps one on display in the front window of the home in Ely, Cambridgeshire, that she has lived in with husband Philip, 71, for 14 years, and changes them regularly. The retired bank customer service adviser came across the design for Cilla the gorilla last year and had changed her position in the window a few times, arranging her in different poses. ‘It’s absolutely ridiculous. It’s not racist at all – gorillas are black. I couldn’t make a white one,’ she added. After the police visit Mrs Feast’s husband made a poster to put in their front window appealing for the offended passer-by to speak to them - but it now seems there was no complaint . But a Cambridge police spokesman has now said:  'At no point was the woman asked to remove the gorilla from her window' After the police visit, Mrs Feast’s husband, a retired lorry driver, made a poster to put in their front window appealing for the offended passer-by to speak to them. It said: ‘Are you the person/persons that made a complaint to police about the knitted toy? ‘Well why don’t you knock on our door and tell us face-to-face what your concerns were about this toy? These toys usually bring a smile to most people’s faces – especially kiddies. ‘I am so looking forward to seeing your face but it’s not going to happen is it?’ But now it seems there wasn’t a complaint after all. A spokesman for Cambridge Police said: ‘The police did not receive any calls from members of the public about this. ‘Instead, while out on patrol two PCSOs saw an object hanging from a window which they thought might be seen as a potentially racially offensive object. ‘The officers were unsure as to what the object was so knocked on the door of the home and asked the woman what it was. After establishing that the object was, in fact, a handmade knitted gorilla and nothing offensive the officers left and carried on their patrols. ‘At no point was the woman asked to remove the gorilla from her window.’","Anne Feast was questioned on her doorstep about 'black body' in window .

"A flash of light from a fiery asteroid is often treated with intrigue when it is spotted on Earth. But scientists at NASA suggest that  asteroids are smashing into the Earth's atmosphere at a higher rate than most people realize. According to a new map by the space agency,  it's a wonder we don't see fireballs raining down from the skies more frequently. Scroll down for video . Collision course:  A NASA map shows the number of asteroids striking Earth's atmosphere over a 20 year period . Light: A bolt of light illuminates the sky from Leonids Meteor Shower on November 17, 1998 . The map from the space agency's Near-Earth Object Program, reveals that more than 556 space rocks smashed into the atmosphere over a 20-year period between 1994 and 2013. The orange dots on the diagram show the frequency of asteroids that hit locations during the day while the blue dots show those that hit at night. They are  measured in billions of Joules (GJ) of energy. Most space rocks were small and harmless and disintegrated when they hit the atmosphere. Yet there are exceptions. Last year on February 15, an asteroid which was 55 feet in diameter with a mass of up to 10,000 tons crashed to earth in the Urals region in Russia. The moment was captured by bewildered commuters on their dash cams in their cars on their way to work. Bright: The flash of light believed to be part of a meteor shower was captured by a stunned motorist on their dash cam in San Antonio, Texas . Meteorite: This Mars meteorite stone was found In California in 2000 and weighed 245.4 grams, it sits beside a square cube of 1 cm  for scale . The flash of light that streaked through the sky in Chelyabinsk before landing in a fiery explosion injured more than a thousand people caused an estimated $33 million in damage. It was the largest to hit the Earth during the agency's mapping period, according to NASA. And just a few days ago, a flash of light believed to be a meteor was captured by a stunned motorist on their dash cam in San Antonio, Texas. Another resident managed to get a photo of the fireball as it sped across the horizon with witnesses saying it had a green glow. NASA said its Near Earth Object Program helps to detect and track space rocks that could cause potential danger. According to CNN, NASA said: 'The new data could help scientists better refine estimates of the distribution of the sizes of NEOs. Finding and characterizing hazardous asteroids to protect our home planet is a high priority.' NASA is dedicating more resources to track potentially dangerous space objects just in case there is a time that Earth needs to be protected from one. It is  developing an Asteroid Redirect Mission called ARM to redirect a space rock into orbit around the moon by the 2020s so astronauts can study it more closely. In a move reminiscent of a plot from a Hollywood blockbuster it is also developing ways to deflect an asteroid from Earth if one heads our way.","NASA map reveals the number of asteroids that smashed into Earth .

"Mizanur Rahman, who was jailed for six years in 2007 after calling for British soldiers killed in Iraq, manages the Siddeeq Academy in Tower Hamlets . An Islamic tuition centre in East London was raided by police as part of a counter-terrorism investigation after it was linked to a convicted extremist. Mizanur Rahman, who was jailed for six years in 2007 after calling for British soldiers to be brought back from Iraq in bodybags, manages the Siddeeq Academy in Tower Hamlets. The 'Islamic education and tuition centre' was among a number of residential and business adresses raided in an operation targeting leadership of the proscribed group once known as Al-Muhajiroun. Police moved against the organisation, banned under anti-terror laws, on the eve of the first British airstrikes against Islamic State militants waging war in Iraq and Syria. Rahman was arrested alongside prominent radical Islamists including Anjem Choudary, Trevor Brooks - who goes by the Arabic name Abu Izzadeen - and Abdul Muhid. Brooks was charged with two counts of breaching his notification requirement and the rest were released on police bail. The private Siddeeq academy, one of around 18 premises searched, provides courses in Arabic, the Koran and Islamic law, as well as national curriculum subjects including English, maths and science. Its website promises 'an Islamic environment for your child', boasting: 'With quality, professional tutors, resources, equipment and small sizes, you can include us in your child`s education programme with confidence.' Rahman took to Twitter to complain about his treatment by police after he was released on bail. 'The entire arrest was only an excuse to distrupt our lives, steal £10,000s property & restrict us from speaking against their foreign policy,' he tweeted. He also claimed police snatched a LeapPad child's tablet computer today from his four-year-old daughter, joking bitterly: 'Dangerous terrorist equipment apparently.' The Sunday Times claims that the children of at least two convicted terrorists attend classes at the academy. MailOnline has tried to contact Rahman for comment but received no reply by the time of publication. Earlier this year, Rahman was investigated by police after a video showed him praising the Boko Haram militants who kidnapped more than 300 Nigerian schoolgirls. He said in the video: ‘People want to make it out as though history began on the day these girls were taken from - sorry I should say these women - were taken from this high school in Nigeria. ‘They didn’t do to these girls what the Nigerian government had been doing to the Muslims all these years. ‘They didn’t rape anybody. They didn’t torture. They didn’t murder any of these girls.’ Islamic education and tuition centre: The home page of the Siddeeq Academy's website . Rahman was jailed between 2007 and 2010 for calling for the killing of UK troops in Iraq. He told a crowd of around 300 near the Danish Embassy in central London in February last year that British and American troops should return in body bags. The Old Bailey saw film of Rahman in which he said: 'We want to see them coming home in body bags. 'We want to see their blood running in the streets of Baghdad.' He added: 'We want to see the Mujahideen shoot down their planes the way we shoot down birds, we want to see their tanks burn in the way we burn their flags.' Rahman also had placards calling for the annihilation and beheading of those who insulted Islam. Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, said: 'He incited or encouraged others to murder in the name of religion.'

"A two-year-old girl has died in hospital days after her stepfather shook her until she suffered a brain hemorrhage, police said. Thaiya Spruill-Smith was rushed to Brookdale Hospital in Brooklyn, New York, on Thursday after her 24-year-old mother Teoka Spruill noticed she was struggling to breathe. Despite numerous operations, doctors last night concluded Thaiya's head injuries were too severe to overcome, and she was taken off life support. Tragic: Thaiya Spruill-Smith, two, was taken off life support on Saturday after suffering a brain hemorrhage . It has since emerged that Thaiya may have been the victim of months of abuse at the hands of her stepfather that was investigated by New York City social services. Relatives have made emotional tributes to the 'smart' and 'sweet' girl as her mother's husband David Adams, 25, appeared in court charged with inflicting the fatal wounds. 'Thai, she was like the sweetest little girl ever, like you wouldn't have problems with her ever,' Shayne Smith, Thaiya's uncle, told Time Warner Cable. Anger: Her father Terrell Smith says she was being systematically abused by her mother's new husband . 'She was very smart - very, very smart.' According to court documents, Adams admitted to shaking Thaiya when questioned. And police sources say there are records of a similar shaking incident in the household last month. Judge Michael Gerstein plans to upgrade Adams' charge from assault to attempted murder once Thaiya's autopsy has been carried out, the New York Daily News reported. Adams, who married Thaiya's mother in March, wept before prosecutors in court as they told him the two-year-old had died. 'He was shocked. He was very, very upset,' defense attorney Joseph Sieger told the New York Post. Thaiya's father Terrell Smith, 26, said social services took custody of the little girl for a week while they investigated Adams for abuse. She was returned and the case was dropped, he said. The ACS has refused to confirm or deny Smith's claims due to confidentiality restrictions. Paramedics were called to the home in the Brownsville area of Brooklyn shortly before 7am on Thursday. According to Smith, she had already had the injuries for days. Spruill, Thaiya's mother, is the half-sister of Tiona Rodriguez, who was caught carrying her dead baby son in a plastic bag in Victoria's Secret last year, then aged 17.","Thaiya Spruill-Smith, 2, died on Saturday after 'shaking on Wednesday'

"A father who has been taking his children to school in a wheelbarrow attached to a bicycle told road safety police he 'knew what he was doing' when stopped at rush hour this morning. Ben Watson said he had been taking daughters to school on the bike for four years and thought the operation launched by Metropolitan police was 'unfair' on cyclists. Hundreds of officers were deployed to London's most dangerous junctions and roads today in a bid to monitor road safety after the deaths of six cyclists in just two weeks. Ben Watson, 57, was stopped by police for taking his two daughters to school in this 'wheelbarrow bike' Mr Watson, who has taken hischildren to school in the bike for years, was stopped on Euston Road, London . Mr Watson said the Met police's road safety operation was 'unfair' on cyclists this morning . Mr Watson was pulled off the road by police this morning near Euston Junction, but was later released. The 57-year-old criticised the officer in question for not knowing the law, saying: 'This policeman called me over and said ""is that bike legal?"" I thought ""well you’re the policeman surely you should be telling me whether its legal or not""'. The house husband from Somers Town added: 'I think it seems a bit unfair as this operation is making out cyclists are the problem when it is actually cars that are the problem. 'I know my lights, I know where I’m going. 'I’ve been taking the kids to school on this route for four years, I know what I’m doing.' 600 police were deployed across London this morning in a crackdown on road safety following the deaths of six cyclists in just two weeks . Police stopped over 70 lorries at 60 of London's most dangerous junctions this morning following a joint decision by the police and County Hall to take further action on securing the safety of cyclists . Six cyclists have been killed in collisions on London roads in just two weeks, prompting police to lay down a 'zero tolerance' policy for dangerous driving. The Mayor's cycling commissioner told the Evening Standard last week: 'This is a new zero-tolerance approach with a police officer on every main road in central London from Monday which is a huge escalation to the checks we are doing already. 'They will be stopping lorries and cars and where there is unsafe driving they will be taken off the road. 'We will also target unsafe cyclists. 'It is a short-term measure but the Mayor and the police feel we must act as a result of the recent spate of appalling accidents.' Police were on the lookout for motorists using mobile phones, drivers stopping in 'bike boxes' at traffic lights and cyclists riding on the inside of HGVs at 60 sites across London today.

"Murder-trial mother Lacey Spears, who is accused of poisoning her son with salt, smiled when a doctor told her his blood tests showed high levels of sodium, a court has heard. Dr Sarika Sunku, a pediatrician who treated Garnett Spears at Nyack Hospital, New York, made the disturbing claim on the eighth day of testimony at his mother's trial. A tireless blogger who documented her son's health problems, Spears is accused of researching, planning and carrying out her son's poisoning, then trying to cover up her role in his death. Horrific: Lacey Spears wept as a court watched video last week of what prosecutors allege shows her 5-year-old son Garrett writhing and screaming in pain after she injected him with a fatal dose of salt . Poignant: Spears is seen here with her son Garnett. Video shown in court allegedly shows her taking him from his bed to a bathroom where prosecutors say she used his stomach feeding tube to inject him with salt . Dr Sunku's testimony came in the same week a second pediatrician told the court that Spears failed to follow up his advice that her son have tests that might have led to the removal of a feeding tube. In testimony yesterday, Dr Ivan Darenkov said he repeatedly recommended a nutritional and feeding evaluation, the Journal News reported. 'Did she ever follow up?' prosecutor Patricia Murphy asked. 'No,' Darenkov told Westchester County Court. Defense lawyers pointed out that Spears never refused the evaluation. She had a follow-up appointment scheduled, which she and her son missed because the boy had already been admitted to Nyack Hospital, the defense said. It is at that hospital that Spears is accused of feeding Garnett, five, a lethal dose of salt through his stomach tube. She then calmly 'watched and waited' for the poisoning to take effect, according to the prosecution. She only summoned help only after he began writhing and retching, the court was told. He died days later, in January last year, of high sodium levels that caused swelling of the brain. Grief: Defendant Lacey Spears brushes her hair back during the opening statements portion of her murder trial at the Westchester County Courthouse in White Plains, New York . Nyack Hospital pediatrician Dr Sunku, who took the witness stand on Tuesday, said Spears 'just had a smile on her face' when blood tests showed Garnett's sodium level had surged, the  Journal News earlier reported. Under cross-examination, Dr Sunku conceded that such an increase could be caused by water loss and did not necessarily mean he had been poisoned with salt. But the insinuation was compounded by a friend of Spears who said she did not see the mother cry when Garnett had a seizure minutes after Spears allegedly administered a dose of salt. Danielle Grossenbacher said Garnett had been 'healthy and happy' just five days before his death, 'jumping off the bed [and] running around the floor' in his hospital room. Then, on a second visit, Ms Grossenbacher said she walked into Garnett's room to find him surrounded by medics and the boy 'flailing all over the bed'. She said Spears appeared 'scared but a little withdrawn' as her son suffered the seizure. 'I did not see her cry,' said Ms Grossenbacher. Mother and son: Spears is accused of killing five-year-old Garnett by feeding him salt through a stomach tube and then calmly 'watched and waited' for the poisoning to take effect, prosecutors said . Assistant District Attorney Doreen Lloyd earlier alleged Spears fed her son the salt in a hospital bathroom after he was admitted. The mother had told doctors he was having seizures. 'It seems to go against nature,' the prosecutor said. 'But Lacey Spears is not like most people.' She said Spears enjoyed the 'attention and sympathy' she received from having a sick child. Spears, who moved to Scottsville, Kentucky, after her son's death, had documented Garnett's declining health on social media. She wiped away a tear as the prosecutor spoke. Defense lawyer Stephen Riebling told the jurors there are no eyewitnesses and no direct evidence that the 27-year-old poisoned her son. He added: 'There is no evidence in this case that legitimately answers the question ""Why?""' Trial: Jurors watched video taken January 19, 2014 in which five hospital staffers surround Garrett as he flails around. There is no audio with the video, but prosecutors claim he was screaming in pain . Ms Lloyd told jurors they would see hospital video showing mother and son twice going into the bathroom and then see Garnett become ill soon afterward both times. He died of high sodium levels that caused swelling of the brain. But the bathroom is out of the range of the camera, and Mr Riebling noted that no-one saw Spears feed her son salt. Garnett's death ended a short life filled with doctor and hospital visits that his mother tirelessly documented in thousands of postings on Facebook, Twitter, MySpace and a blog. Many of the postings will be in evidence, along with Spears' online research into the dangers of sodium in children and hospital records from New York, Florida and Spears' native Alabama. Against the objections of defense lawyers, Ramapo police Sergeant John Lynch is today due to testify on the web pages Spears allegedly visited and read in prepartion for poisoning her son. Also in evidence is a feeding bag prosecutors believe was used to hold the salt - and which they say she tried to hide after Garnett's death. Defense attorneys have insisted that there will be no mention of Munchausen by proxy, a disorder in which caretakers secretly harm children to win sympathy. Some experts believe that disorder fits Spears' actions. Spears denies charges of second-degree murder and first-degree manslaughter. The trial continues.","Second doctor says Lacey Spears ignored his advice for nutritional tests .

"Guilty: Ketut Pujayasa has admitted to the rape, attempted murder and sexual abuse of a 31-year-old passenger on a nudist cruise he was working on . A cruise ship worker brutally beat, raped and tried to throw a passenger overboard because he believed she insulted his mother. Ketut Pujayasa, 29, changed his plea in the Miami courtroom to guilty on charges of attempted murder and aggravated sexual assault. Pujayasa's court-appointed lawyers declined to comment on why their client opted to plea rather than face trial. They also did not disclose what length of sentence they would recommend to the judge. Earlier this year, it was revealed how a 31-year-old American woman was found 'painted in blood from head to toe' after being beaten and raped by Pujayasa, a cabin steward, on a Holland America cruise ship. Pujayasa claims he attacked the 31-year-old because she insulted his family when he tried to deliver her breakfast on Valentine's Day. The vicious assault on the woman only came to a halt when passengers, who heard the commotion inside the stateroom, began banging on the door. The 29-year-old cruise ship worker told the FBI he used a master key to break into the passenger's room at night time, and attacked her in her bed. The ships' doctor, a 40-year veteran emergency room physician, told FBI agents that the woman was so severely injured he thought she might die. 'In his 40 years, he had not seen such a violent attack,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Francis Viamontes said. 'Every witness who saw her said she was completely covered in blood.' The woman, who was on a Bare Necessities nudist cruise, was saved after a fellow passenger pounded on her guestroom door, allegedly scaring off Pujayasa who claims to have jumped to a lower balcony to escape. FBI agent David Nunez testified that Pujayasa, a room service attendant on the ship, confessed to his roommate and gave to a statement to authorities. Pujayasa allegedly told police he decided to attack the woman, who has not been named, after she told him: 'Wait a minute, son of a b****' when he knocked on her door with her breakfast. 'Pujayasa stated that the passenger's comment of 'son of a bitch' was offensive to himself and his parents. He was angry and upset the rest of the day. He interpreted the comment as an insult to his family and sought revenge. Pujayasa told the agents that he was accustomed to personal insults and verbal abuse from rude passengers but lost it over what he said was an insult to his family. Ordeal: The 31-year-old passenger had been vacationing on Holland America's cruise ship, Nieuw Amsterdam . Specialist tour: The passenger was on a Bare Necessities tour, which caters to nudist travelers . 'He made that point over and over again, that it wasn't about insulting him, it was about insulting his family — especially his mother,' Agent Nunez said. Pujayasa, who is married and lived with his wife, parents and three siblings in Indonesia, had no prior criminal history in the U.S. or his native country, officials said. 'The passenger also noted that [the victim] had a curling iron wrapped and tangled around her neck and/or hair. He also described [her] as having black eyes and visible bruising around her neck and shoulders. '[The woman], fearing death was imminent, asked the passenger to relay to her family how much she loved them,' the FBI report stated. The cruise ship docked in Honduras and the victim was airlifted to a Florida hospital. Security guards on the ship detained Pujayasa until they arrived in the Everglades. The victim had been on an eight-day cruise with nudist vacation specialists Bare Necessities, which took in Jamaica, the Bahamas and Honduras on a voyage that left Florida on February 9. As well as traveling to exotic destinations, guests were able to take part in couples massage, Tantra classes, a production of the Vagina Monologues and a Captain's party, according to the travel company's website. Guests on the cruises, which had been run previously on the Nieuw Amsterdam, are required to wear clothes only when the ship is in port, or when they are at dinner or attending the Captain's party. Agents said Pujayasa, who is 5 feet 2 inches tall and weighs 140 pounds, inflicted a horrific beating and sexual assault on the woman, a U.S. citizen identified only by her initials in court. He said he fell asleep on her balcony while waiting for her to return, remained hidden until she lay down and closed her eyes, then violently attacked her, agents said. Clothes-free: Bare Necessities has run previous nudist tours on the cruise shiip . Pujayasa said little at Monday's hearing. He wore tan and brown jailhouse scrubs and earphones that enabled him to hear an interpreter. 'If this case were to go to trial, do you believe they could prove what they just said,' U.S. District Judge Jose E. Martinez asked. 'Yes,' Pujayasa said. Martinez followed up: 'Is it true?' 'Yes,' Pujayasa again said. Pujayasa was arrested when the ship returned to Fort Lauderdale, and he was immediately fired from his job. Had the case gone to trial, he could have faced life in prison if convicted. He will likely be deported if he ever gets out of prison.","Victim had phone cord wrapped round her neck in vicious attack .

"A teenager who was barred from the Army because he has a nut allergy accused military top brass of 'dietary discrimination' today. Adam John, 18, was told he could not be given nut-free products while out on the frontline even though the Army will cater for vegetarians and provide halal and kosher food for Muslim and Jewish squaddies. Now the teenager from Bolton, Greater Manchester, intends to spark a debate in Parliament about the issue by starting an e-petition.

"A huge group of angry pupils went on strike yesterday after their school banned them from wearing bracelets in support of a classmate with leukaemia. Police were called in when 100 pupils walked out of lessons at Bilton School in Rugby, Warwickshire, after being told they could only wear 'Team Joel' bracelets on a non-uniform day next month. Pupils who want to wear the wristbands in support of Joel Smith - a Year 11 pupil who is undergoing hospital treatment - on other days have been warned they will be violating the school's uniform policy. Tragic case: Joel Smith, a Year 11 pupil at Bilton School in Rugby, Warwickshire, died last Thursday evening . Controversy: Police were called by teachers when 100 pupils walked out of lessons at Bilton School in Rugby, Warwickshire, after being told they could only wear 'Team Joel' bracelets (pictured) on a non-uniform day . Made by his family: Wristbands in support of leukaemia sufferer Joel Smith and the Teenage Cancer Trust . Showing their support: Pupils at Bilton School in Rugby showed whose side they were on last week . Joel's family have been making and selling the beaded bracelets to raise funds for the Teenage Cancer Trust. But yesterday, pupils mounted a protest against the bracelet ban on the school field. Mother Emma Howell told the Daily Mirror that she would support her daughter Laura's participation in the strike, despite it resulting in her missing a mock examination yesterday. She said: 'I support my daughter. If she's excluded for five days there will be no punishment at home. She won't be missing out on anything because she's just revising anyway as she's in Year 11. 'The only resolution I can see is if the school back down because the pupils are very passionate about this, and I can’t see them letting it go.’ The school said it had responded several weeks ago to a request from the children to have a non-uniform day for Joel, and he had requested that pupils wear blue and white coloured clothing. Support for staff and pupils: A Bilton School statement said it was an 'extraordinarily sad and difficult time' Reasoning: The school said it had responded several weeks ago to a request from the children to have a non-uniform day for Joel, and he had requested that pupils wear blue and white coloured clothing . Firm stance: Bilton School refused to let its pupils wear a charity bracelet in support of the pupil every day . This was planned for April 11, but the . school also told pupils that the bracelets could only be sold and . worn on that day - a policy which has caused much anger among the children. A . spokesman said: ‘We spoke to students and said that they could show . their support by attaching the bracelets to bags or keys but not wear . them as bracelets, in order to comply with our policies. 'We called the police who supported us in evaluating the safety of staff and students, which is paramount to us' Bilton School spokesman . ‘This has been the topic of quite extensive social media comment over the last two days, culminating in a call from students and parents for students to strike yesterday. ‘Although this was a largely peaceful event, we called the police who supported us in evaluating the safety of staff and students, which is paramount to us.’ The school added that it then told pupils how it was helping Joel and his family - and the many of them who quickly returned to lessons would make up the lost learning time during detentions. Punishment: The school said it explained to the students how it was helping Joel and his family, and those who quickly returned to lessons would make up the lost learning time during detentions . But the spokesman continued: ‘There were a small minority of students whose actions can only be described as anti-social and potentially dangerous who used this as an opportunity to be disruptive. ‘These students were putting pressure on others not to go back into classrooms and contacted the press. We will be evaluating the actions we will be taking with these students over the next few days.’ 'The only resolution I can see is if the school back down . because the pupils are very passionate about this, and I can’t see them letting . it go’ Emma Howell, mother . The Facebook page 'Spotted: Rugby Town' has been inundated with angry comments since the ban on bracelets was announced. One comment said: ‘Disgraceful, how must Joel be feeling knowing his own school are not supporting him in the biggest fight of his life? They should be ashamed of themselves.’ And another added: ‘Students should keep wearing them, they can't send the whole school home. Show solidarity against a stupid rule.’ Doing their bit: The school said it had responded several weeks ago to a request from students to have a non-uniform day for Joel, and he had requested that students wear blue and white coloured clothing . It comes after MailOnline reported last week that a teacher in Essex allegedly ordered a 10-year-old boy to take off his Help for Heroes wristband because it could cause offence. Tracy Tew was shocked when her son Charlie was put on a report card at Maldon Primary School after he refused to take off the charity rubber bracelet sold to honour injured soldiers. Charlie wore the wristband - bought at the Colchester Military Festival - in honour of murdered soldier Lee Rigby and service personnel in his family, including his great-granddad and uncle. Tracy Thornton, the headmistress at that school, insisted wearing wristbands was against the school’s jewellery policy.","Police called in when 100 pupils leave lessons at Bilton School in Rugby .

"West Ham United are hoping to lure full-back Carl Jenkinson across London after Arsenal completed the £10million signing of Mathieu Debuchy. Hammers boss Sam Allardyce would like to bring Jenkinson to Upton Park permanently but is also exploring the possibility of acquiring the services of the England international on loan.

The Magpies themselves had been linked to Jenkinson as a replacement for Debuchy but they announced the arrival of Dutch international right-back Daryl Janmaat on Thursday instead. Swansea City have already contacted Arsenal about the potential availability of Jenkinson and it looks likely to be a straight race between the Welsh outfit and the Hammers for his signature. Arsene Wenger is keen to keep Jenkinson in North London as he looks to be build a squad capable of challenging on several fronts, but the 22-year-old may push for a move if he thinks it will help his England chances.

"Laurie Dishman told senators through tears on Wednesday that she was choked and raped on a Royal Caribbean cruise by one of the line's employees working as a security guard. She was using her experience to shed light on the dangers that passengers might face on cruises. 'Cruise consumers have virtually no rights or protections,' Dishman, a resident of Sacramento, California, said during a Senate Commerce Committee hearing in which witnesses called for more passenger protections on cruise liners. 'I know this first-hand.' Dishman said she was hurt and humiliated during the 2006 incident when staff members were slow and discourteous in helping her. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Laurie Dishman (left) told senators through tears on Wednesday that she was choked and raped on a Royal Caribbean cruise by one of the line's employees . Of the incident, she said: 'A cruise line employee raped me on a vacation cruise to Mexico. The crew member was working as a security guard at the disco on the ship. 'He approached me and asked me my name and cabin number.  He later snuck down to my cabin and forced his way in. 'I resisted and struggled.  He strangled me and brutally raped me. I awoke with marksaround my neck. 'There were no police on the ship and I was hesitant to report the crime because he wore a security badge.' After telling authorities, they made her collect evidence in trash bags and didn't take her to the infirmary immediately, administer anti-retroviral medications or give her another cabin in which to stay during the cruise to Mexico. Even after an FBI investigation when the ship docked in the U.S., her rapist was never arrested or tried in the United States, Dishman said. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., the committee chairman, said Dishman's experience and other horror stories recounted at the hearing point to a lack of oversight and accountability for passenger safety in the cruise industry. 'In spite of the evidence that crimes, fires, mechanical failures, drownings and mishandled medical emergencies occur with disturbing regularity on cruise ships, the industry continues to deny that it has a problem,' Rockefeller said. Rockefeller introduced a bill last year to improve protection of passengers on cruise ships. The hearing Wednesday was the second he has called to raise awareness of the problems and how his bill could address them. While cruise line officials appeared at the earlier hearing, no industry representatives were present for Wednesday's session. Rockefeller repeated throughout the hearing that the majority of people who take cruises have a good and safe time, but he added that even those relatively rare occurrences of passenger peril drive home the necessity of putting more protections into place. Philip Gerson, a Miami-based civil trial lawyer who has litigated cruise liner cases, said significant improvements in passenger safety are needed. Gerson said that one of his clients was a 15-year-old girl with Asperger syndrome who was raped by a juvenile and an adult while on a holiday cruise in the Caribbean. Her mother believed that teen activities would be supervised by cruise staff as suggested by promotional material, he said. There were not enough security personnel on the ship, he said, putting the teenager at risk. 'If you think that young women are safe on cruise ships, think again. They're not,' he said. The Carnival Triumph (pictured) cruise ship lost propulsion after an engine room fire in 2013 and was adrift off southern Mexico's Yucatan peninsula . Another witness, Kim Ware of Houston, said she was a passenger on the Carnival Triumph in 2013 when it lost power in the Gulf of Mexico after an engine room fire that disabled basic systems including water and sewage. She described how feces in red biohazard bags lined the hallway, a 'tent city' appearing on the deck to shield passengers from the sun, and sewage coming up through the shower drains. Ware said she was scared that fights would break out on the ship as food hording became common and the stench became worse. There was little to no direction from staff, she said. 'It was soon very clear that Carnival Cruise Lines had no plan in place for such a disaster,' she said. 'They were essentially winging it.' Committee members said cruises need to make it clear to passengers before they buy their tickets what rights they have onboard and what rights they are giving up. They also need to make more clear how safe cruises actually are, they said. Last August, major cruise liners began voluntarily posting crime data online amid pressure from Congress and victims for more transparency. But the panelists and committee members said it wasn't enough. The Associated Press generally does not identify victims of sexual assault unless they come forward publicly.","Laurie Dishman spoke of being choked and raped on a Royal Caribbean cruise in 2006 .

"The Met Office has warned that Britain could be facing one of its wettest winters ever, amid claims the conditions are perfect for a series of powerful Atlantic storms. After a mild October, much of the country has been subjected to heavy rainfall in recent days, with some localised flooding, particularly in the south west  - a region among the worst hit by last year's winter floods. And the latest three-month outlook from the Met Office, which covers November to January, suggests that the next three months will be wetter than average, with weather fronts coming in from the Atlantic ocean, bringing stormy conditions. Scroll down for video . Flood risk: The Met Office has warned that Britain could be facing its wettest winter for 33 years, giving rise to fears of flooding in areas hit by last year's winter storms - such as Muchelney in Somerset (pictured) Jet Stream: Researchers have suggested that the jet stream (pictured), which carries weather systems to the UK from across the Atlantic has become stronger. It is caused when warmer air from over the Gulf Stream  meets colder air from the Artic . Misty morning: British Airways planes can be seen through the fog this morning at Heathrow . 'The outlook suggests the continuing risk of our weather coming in from the Atlantic, which brings unsettled conditions, during the first part of the three-month period,' the outlook states. And while the Met Office experts suggest that more unsettled conditions are typical for autumn, the outlook says 'spells of wet and windy weather may be more frequent than is typical'. Last year's winter was the wettest ever on record, with the UK hit by 486.8mm of rain between December and February, narrowly above the previous record of 485.1mm set in 1995. Temperatures are likely to be milder than average for the first part of the outlook, although colder weather is predicted for January, with the outlook adding: 'The risk of occasional colder outbreaks increases later in the period'. Fog: Parts of the south east got off to a foggy start this morning, with some rain forecast for later . Autumnal feel: Boats moored on the River Nene in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, this morning . Into the mist: A cyclist crosses the bridge between Overton and Gunwade lakes in Peterborough . Forecast: The start of the week will be unsettled, with rain forecast for Monday, but Tuesday will be drier . Researchers have suggested that the jet stream, which carries weather systems to the UK from across the Atlantic has become stronger, bringing sea temperatures and windspeeds which could lead to a particularly wet winter. Adam Scaife, professor of applied mathematics at the Met Office, who specialises in modelling longer-term weather and climate patterns, said: 'The rainfall over the last few weeks has already been well above average. 'These storms are generated by the jet stream which also carries them eastwards towards us. The jet stream has recently got stronger and moved north, which could carry weather systems from the Atlantic right over the UK.' Last Friday saw Devon hit by winds of 93mph, Wales struck by 75mph gales and Hampshire suffering widespread flooding. Singing in the rain: People gather under umbrellas to watch the orchestra perform at the Bournemouth Christmas Market today . Wrapped up warm: A mother and her daughter don their waterproofs and wellies to stay dry in Bournemouth . The outlook's summary suggests that the probability that precipitation during the November to January period will fall into the wettest category is around 25 percent, although this comes with the caveat that the probability of it being in the driest category is 15 percent. Jet streams, which can reach speeds of 200mph, are caused by the temperature difference between tropical air masses and polar air masses and steer weather patterns around the globe. An increased difference in temperature between the cold Artic region and the warm Gulf Stream ocean current and rising wind speed with altitude above the two stretches of water could also lead to storms in the UK. Cooler temperatures: People take an afternoon walk along the shoreline at Brighton beach, Sussex, despite the dropping temperatures . Beside the seaside: Although the weather has turned cooler, the beach was still a popular place to be today . Enjoying the view: A couple take time to sit and watch the sea, despite the dark clouds swirling overhead . The potential for these factors to combine, generating UK-bound storms is so great that Professor Scaife and his colleagues are promoting a new term - 'baroclinicity' - to describe it. The word could even be incorporated into TV forecasts. Prof Scaife added: 'It's a word we might need to get used to - it means we are likely to get more wet and windy weather.' In the more immediate future, the Met Office forecast for the next month predicts that the west of the country is most likely to see heavier rain and stronger winds, with frost more likely after next weekend. Walking the dog: These dog walkers took advantage of a break from the rain to stretch their legs . Sporting chance: A group of friends swapped wellies for shorts for a spot of beach volleyball in Brighton . Determined: Even a spot of rain could not stop this pair from visiting Brighton beach this afternoon . After weekend showers the Met Office told motorists to be wary of the conditions and warned of localised flooding nationwide. They forecast a 'grey and miserable' rush hour tomorrow morning in the Midlands and east, with most of the UK soaked later. Fronts originating in the Atlantic will dump 10-20mm of rain in the South-West and West on Wednesday, moving to the South and North on Thursday, and followed by further rain plus gales on Friday and again during the weekend in the West and North, with the East drier but still seeing showers at times. Chaos: Workmen fixing a pothole on the M25, which opened up on Friday morning after bad weather hit Leatherhead in Surrey . Met Office forecaster Emma Corrigan said: 'It will be a grey, miserable start on Monday, with an unsettled week ahead, windy at times. 'Parts are saturated and more prone to impacts such as localised water issues. 'Warnings have not issued but that may change, so people should monitor warnings. 'A system pushing in through Monday means rain will be falling in the morning rush hour. People should definitely be aware of the conditions. 'Monday’s rain will affect much of the UK, with heavier bursts and possibly persistent, particularly in the North-East, with 45mph wind gusts. 'An Atlantic band of rain comes in on Tuesday night into Wednesday, with 10-20mm falling. 'Low pressure arriving later on Thursday will affect the South-West and West, with the weekend seeing a front likely to come in from the Atlantic and move across parts of UK, wettest in the West with the East drier. 'Places have been wetter than average in the past week and unsettled weather is expected to continue to the start of December. 'We’ll be able to see how this year might fare compared to previous years when we get the November rainfall statistics at the end of the month.' Torrential  rain overnight caused floods in some parts of Devon, where several properties in the seaside town of Sidmouth suffered flooding and electrical failure as heavy rain lashed the region from 10pm onwards. Four people had to be rescued from their car trapped in floodwater in the town, while another driver also had to freed after his car was caught in floodwater at nearby Clyst St George near Woodbury just before midnight.","After a mild October much of the country has been hit by heavy rain .

"Waitrose chief executive Mark Price said supermarkets may be forced to close because of major changes in Britain's shopping habits . Big supermarkets may be forced to close due to major changes in our shopping habits, the boss of Waitrose has warned. Chief executive Mark Price predicts Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons will follow the trend of DIY giants B&Q and Homebase, which have announced store closures. He argued that the rise of smaller stores combined with a move away from the big weekly grocery shop represents a change ‘as fundamental as supermarkets coming into the UK in the 1950s and reinventing what food shopping was all about’. Mr Price told the Sunday Telegraph: ‘This is as fundamental as supermarkets coming into the UK in the 1950s and reinventing what food shopping was all about,’ he said. ‘People are buying food for now. The notion that you are going to go and push a trolley around for the week is a thing of the past. It is fundamentally changing the market. ‘I think we are at one of those inflection points where customers are acting differently and retailers are going to have to respond to it. ‘Look at B&Q. Look at Homebase. I think that food is probably four or five years behind non-food. ‘What you have seen over the last five years is 12 per cent of non-food space taken out of the market. You have had no food space retired over that period. In fact what you have been seeing is food space growing by 3-5 per cent. ‘So, more and more space has been added at a time before you get the impact of internet, convenience shopping and all the other shifts that we talked about.’ In what has been dubbed an ‘end of the space race’, Sainsbury’s and Tesco have already cancelled the building of larger supermarkets. Tesco mothballed a new £22million store in Chatteris, Cambridgeshire, and another in Immingham, Lincolnshire. It has also announced that a controversial development in Margate will not go ahead, despite a long battle to get planning permission. The days of filling up the trolley for a weekly shop could soon be over, the Waitrose boss said . Closed: The £22million mothballed Tesco store in Chatteris, Cambridgeshire, which will not open its doors . Last week Sainsbury’s announced 40 supermarket developments will not go ahead. A review of its business had found a quarter of existing stores are either the wrong size or in the wrong location. Mr Price’s comments come against the rising popularity of Aldi and Lidl, which operate from smaller stores with a reduced range of groceries, laced with some cheaper upmarket items. Last week, Aldi announced it plans to more than double the number of UK stores, taking the total to 1,000. Lidl is embarked on a similar growth, while both say they are looking at opening a raft of smaller convenience stores in urban centres to catch the new shopping trend for regular top-ups on food. Joanne Denney-Finch, of the Institute for Grocery Distribution, said: ‘Convenience stores are benefiting from a cultural shift towards shopping little and often. They are increasingly providing products tailored to specific locations rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.’","Big supermarkets may be forced to close, Waitrose boss Mark Price says .

"Tim Blackwood has been jailed for 10 months after he punched a patient with severe learning disabilities and threatened to 'knock him out' at the Newcastle-under-Lyme care home he worked in . A carer punched a patient with severe learning difficulties in the ribs and threatened to knock him out after he threw a clipboard across the room. Staff at Ashley House Hospital in Newcastle-under-Lyme had to hold back Tim Blackwood after he launched the unprovoked attack on the patient and started swearing at him. The patient had been leaving the room with another member of staff when the pair argued and as he went through the door Blackwood lunged at him and punched him. He was jailed for 10 months after Judge David Fletcher said the attack took place when he was 'in charge of some of the most vulnerable members of our society.' Blackwood initially said he had punched the man because he felt threatened but later conceded that he had behaved 'inappropriately' in the heat of the moment. Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard he had also failed to declare two cautions in order to get the job at the care home, run by the Huntercombe group. He had been working at the home for eight weeks when the incident took place. The court heard Blackwood lashed out in September 2013 after a patient threw a clipboard across the lounge. Blackwood responded with the 'knock you out' threat, before swearing and punching the man in the ribs. Nurse Abigail Haynes said: 'Tim was swearing a lot and the pair continued to be verbally aggressive to each other. 'I told the patient to come to the relaxation room with me to calm down and he agreed. 'As he was walking through the door, Tim lunged forward and punched him on the back of the ribs. I saw it clearly. 'The patient seemed really shocked. When we checked his body, he had red marks.' Support worker Matt Hope added: 'Verbal arguments happen quite often. It's part of what we have to deal with on a daily basis. 'When Tim punched the patient I was shocked. He was not being threatening at all. Ashley House Hospital in Staffordshire is a low secure hospital for men and women with learning difficulties . 'We are trained to de-escalate situations by using low-level calming methods.' Paul Cliff, defending, admitted that staff are not meant to react to provocation. He added: 'He's a man who has suffered from stress and depression and was never cut out for this kind of work. 'The defendant has spent a lifetime in work and is now the principal carer for his 87-year-old mother.' At the hearing Blackwood pleaded guilty to fraud and mistreating a patient. He was sentenced to 10 months imprisonment for ill-treating a patient and six months imprisonment for fraud, to run concurrently. The Huntercombe Group said Mr Blackwood was suspended immediately and has now been dismissed. A spokesman said: 'The well-being of patients is our priority and we have a whistle-blowing policy that encourages staff to raise any concerns they may have about any aspect of care.' Ashley House Hospital is a low secure hospital near to Market Drayton and provides care for adult men and women.","Tim Blackwood threatened to 'knock out' a patient after he threw clipboard .

"Australia won't budge on its climate change stance in the wake of the G20 summit as it's on track to make substantial reductions in anyone's language, the Abbott government says. Sunday's temperature scorched to over 40, while the world's leaders turned up the heat on the host, which resulted in the globe's largest economies declaring their support for strong climate action. But Prime Minister Tony Abbott has defended the government's record, saying unlike  other nations, Australia will meet its emissions reduction target by 2020. Tony Abbott confirmed the G20 will work together to adopt a protocol under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to present at the Paris climate conference in 2015 . 'We are doing a very great deal and I suppose given what we are doing we don't intend at this time to do more,' he said at a joint press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Sydney on Sunday night. The government resisted pressure to make climate change a priority issue at the Brisbane summit. But the United States and China unveiled a surprise deal to tackle carbon emissions and President Barack Obama rallied rich nations to do more. Prime Minister Tony Abbott  addressed the G20 and says the nations strongly back action on climate change . The prime minister said Australia will meet its emissions reduction target by 2020 . When asked whether Australia's climate change plan would change following the weekend's outcome, Mr Abbott said what the government was doing was very substantial. 'And our commitment on emissions reduction, five per cent on 2000 figures by 2020 is one way of putting it,' he said. 'But against business as usual it's actually a 19 per cent reduction, which is a substantial reduction in anyone's language. 'Unlike some countries which have made commitments and not met them we will meet this commitment.' Mr Abbott reiterated his stance on coal and said it was going to be an important energy source for decades to come. At the bilateral meeting, Mr Abbott and Ms Merkel established a joint working group to develop the Australian-German relationship. Both leaders said it could be improved while Ms Merkel acknowledged both nations shared the same values on Russia and Islamic State.

President Barack Obama,  Tony Abbott and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at their meeting on Sunday . World leaders have turned up the heat on  Abbott to make sure there is 'real action' on the controversial issue . Climate change wasn't on the formal agenda prepared by the Australian presidency, but supportive statements by US President Barack Obama over the weekend ensured its inclusion in the final statement. The leaders agreed their future actions will support sustainable development, economic growth and certainty for business and investment. The G20 will work together to adopt a protocol under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to present at the Paris climate conference in 2015. 'We encourage parties that are ready to communicate their intended nationally determined contributions well in advance,' they said. 'We reaffirm our support for mobilising finance for adaptation and mitigation, such as the Green Climate Fund.' The UN-backed fund was set up to help poor countries deal with the impacts of climate change, such as rising sea levels and severe weather events.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel (pictured right) chats with British Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured centre) and US President Barack Obama (pictured left) during the USA-EU meeting at the G20 summit in Brisbane . The US this weekend committed $US3 billion to the fund, and Japan $US1.5 billion. Following his address to the G20, Mr Abbott was questioned about Australia's commitment to climate change. 'This government has just passed through the parliament legislation to put into effect our emission reduction fund, a $2.5 billion fund,' said Mr Abbott. 'We aren't just talking about taking action about climate change, we are cracking on with the job.' 'Australia is a high performer when it comes to actually delving on real action when it comes to tackling climate change.' 'We'll be making further decisions at the right time. What we want to do is to take effective action against climate change which is consistent with strong economic growth.' On Saturday US president Barack Obama said that no country was immune to the effects of climate change and that everyone must play a role in fighting the global phenomena. 'I want my daughters to be able to come back and I want them to be able to bring their daughters or sons to visit,' he told an audience at the University of Queensland to loud applause.

'I want that there 50 years from now.' Meanwhile, under pressure to jolt the stubbornly lethargic world economy back to life, leaders of G-20 nations finalised a plan to boost global GDP by more than $2 trillion over five years by investing in infrastructure and increasing trade. The communique also revealed that leaders plan to jump start growth in part by creating a global infrastructure hub and it would help match potential investors with projects. They also aim to reduce the gap between male and female participation in the workforce by 25 percent by 2025. Tony Abbott said countries will hold each other to account by monitoring implementation of their commitments to boost growth. The International Monetary Fund and OECD will also play a role in monitoring progress and estimating the economic benefits. U.S. President Barack Obama (pictured right) and France's President Francois Hollande (pictured left) during a meeting with European leaders at G20 Summit to discuss transatlantic trade and the situation in Ukraine . The G-20 communique says if the $2 trillion initiative is fully implemented it would lift global GDP by 2.1 percent above expected levels by 2018 and create millions of jobs. Abbott said countries have agreed more than 800 measures to spur the global economy, which the IMF says is facing a 'new mediocre.' 'The G-20 has delivered real, practical outcomes and, because of the efforts that the G-20 has made, this year, culminating in the last 48 hours, people right around the world are going to be better off,' Abbott said. But with international agencies downgrading their global growth forecasts in recent months, the G-20 - which represents around 85 percent of the global economy - faces an uphill struggle to implement its plan. Growth in China and Japan has weakened and Europe is teetering on the brink of a recession. Abbott said leaders unanimously agreed that expanding global trade would directly benefit countries and people around the world. 'Trade is a key driver of growth, perhaps the key driver of growth and we're focused on domestic reforms to facilitate trade as well as the importance of a strong global trading system,' Abbott said.","G20 nations confirmed they have strongly backed action on climate change .

"A teacher who received one year in jail for having sex with her student had her sentence bumped to two years. Married former Houston English teacher Kathryn Murray, 31, was jailed for an affair with student Jimmy Pallais, now 17. Her sentence had to be increased to bring it in line with sentencing rules. She was jailed for two years this week with no probation after officials released her original one year sentence fell below the minimum requirement for her plea deal. In disbelief: Kathryn Murray had a lock of shock on her face as she was led away by deputies following an increase in her sentencing . During her trial, the court heard how their relationship . began when when Murray was assigned to help Spanish-speaking Pallais . after he was adopted from Costa Rica and brought to America by his . parents at age 14. The disgraced former educator pleaded guilty last month to one count of improper relations with a student and one count of sexual relations with a child. Two other counts were dropped as part of the agreement, according to KHOU. The pair were separated after Jimmy confessed to having a crush on her, but a relationship began after he kissed her in school. The pair had sex in Murray's classroom at Memorial Middle School several times, booked into a hotel and were finally caught in the family home by Jimmy's 12-year-old brother. Thoughts of suicide: Jimmy Pallais, now 17, said he thought of killing himself to make the fallout with his affair with married Kathryn Murray, 31, 'go away' Prior to her sentencing, former student lover Jimmy told ABC's 20/20: 'that maybe if I [would] kill myself they [would forget] about this.' The show also revealed new details of the events leading up to the pair's affair. As Jimmy's feelings for Murray grew, he wrote her a letter confessing his love before tearing it up and giving it to Murray to throw away. But she ended up reading it anyway and told him: 'I read you're letter. I really like you, like, for real.' Jimmy's parents suspicions grew as he told them how 'pretty' Murray was at home and the pair were separated. Jailed: Kathryn Murray smiles as she s jailed for a year last week for her relationship with Jimmy Pallais when he was 15 . But the pair continued to chat online and the affair started when Jimmy walked up to Murray in her classroom and kissed her, before walking to his first class. When he saw her again, Murray said she could kiss him again - and the affair developed with a series of sexual liasions in her classroom and a hotel. They were discovered when Jimmy's little brother found them in bed together and Jimmy's parents found a text from Murray reading: 'You know I love you... I don't know what we're going to do, but we're going to be happy together... I'm worried about how obvious we are at school. I'm miss you.' His parents said: 'She robbed him of his childhood.I think it took his innocence away, because...that was his first time having sex.' The inappropriate relationship began in February 2012 when Murray, who is still married, was tutoring the Spanish-speaking eighth grader and the two went on to have 'repeated' sexual encounters, according to KHOU. Inappropriate relationship: Former Houston English teacher Kathryn Camille Murray, 31, was sentenced to one year in jail and one year in prison on Tuesday for sleeping with a student multiple times . On one occasion, Murray picked up the teen from a school dance after his dad dropped him off and took him to a hotel where they had sex for two hours. The couple were caught the following night by the teen's younger brother who found them in bed at the family home while their parents were away. Murray was fired that month following the allegations but remained free on $50,000 bail. Police discovered that the two had sex in a classroom at least twice and that prior to her arrest, Murray had closed her bank account and planned to skip the border to Mexico. At school: In the course of their investigation, police discovered that Murray had sex with the 15-year-old student she was tutoring at least two times in a classroom at Memorial Middle School . Despite being barred from seeing the teen by a judge, the affair continued. In January 2013, Murray was arrested again when she was found with the teen at her father's home. When police showed up at the house, the teen, then 16, tried to escape through the back door. She was charged with harboring a runaway and this time her bond was revoked. Won't stop: Murray's affair with the boy continued even after she was arrested. Police found the then 16-year-old with Murray at her father's house and she was charged with harboring a minor . Murray attended Memorial Middle and High School and had been working in the Spring Branch ISD for the previous three years as a language arts teacher. Records say she is still married to her husband and they live at the same address in Houston. To this day, the teen she had relations with insists that they are in love but his mother calls him a victim. 'We are not good, we are very hurt. My son is really confused, hurt. We working with him very closely but he’s not good, not good at all,' the mother said.","Kathryn Camille Murray, 31, was sentenced to two years in prison after first being sentenced to only one year, plus another year of probation .

"A woman who lost her pet Chihuahua in a lightning-fast carjacking has been reunited with the missing pup - though he has got dangerously thin. Eleni Pappas, 23, stepped outside her Audi A4 at a gas station to pay for her fuel when an opportunist leaped in and sped away, with 11-month-old Leo still in the back seat. The carjacking more than a week ago led to desperate pleas from Pappas for her pet to be returned - even without the car. But this week she found the vehicle, not far from where it was stolen, in Mill Basin, Brooklyn. Leo was still inside, but a pound lighter after 6 days with no food or water. Home at last: Leo was found in the stolen Audi A4, which his owner Eleni Pappas stumbled across while taking her aunt home . Best friends: Elani Pappas, 23, said she feels sick at the thought of her little dog Leo being taken by the thief . Returned: Pappas proudly displays Leo's named collar after he was returned - albeit lighter . For the tiny pooch, that's around a quarter of his body weight. Writing on a Facebook page set up to help find Leo, Pappas wrote: 'Last night at 9 pm I was driving my aunt home. 'I forgot to turn down her street so I used another street.. while driving I saw an Audi A4 we got closer and saw my plate number. '911 was called immediately, police came and I begged them to go check my car to see if Leo was inside because I was too nervous. 'The police officer approached my vehicle and came back with a huge smile and two thumbs up.

"Richard Usher is said to be at the heart of allegations of fixing foreign exchange rates . The currency trader at the centre of an alleged multi-billion pound scam has been named – but he insists he has done nothing wrong. The Daily Mail can reveal that Richard Usher, 39, is at the ‘front, left, right and centre’ of allegations that staff at major banks colluded on online chatrooms to fix foreign exchange rates and make ‘free money’ for their firms and themselves. A source at his last employer, JP Morgan, said the bank may seek to ‘claw back’ millions in bonuses paid to him. Chancellor George Osborne and his shadow Ed Balls are urging the Serious Fraud Office to go after the traders involved, such as Mr Usher and his fellow ‘Cartel’ chatroom member, British banker Rohan Ramchandani, 34, of Citigroup. Embarrassingly, both Mr Usher and Mr Ramchandani were official advisers to the Bank of England committee on the workings of the foreign exchange market. But a close friend of Mr Usher insisted he had done nothing wrong, saying he was ‘paid by the banks to meet targets and make money’. Speaking on the doorstep of the £800,000 home in idyllic Kent countryside he shares with wife Debbie, 40, Mr Usher, who was quietly sacked last month after being suspended for a year, said: ‘I’m sorry, I’ve got no comments to make.’ His friend told the Daily Mail: ‘It’s being made to seem as if making money on a foreign exchange trade is not just a bad thing, but a criminal offence – it’s neither.’ Traders from six banks – including HSBC and RBS – are said to have colluded on chatrooms to maximise profits for themselves and their banks. The banks have accepted fines totalling £2.6billion from Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority and US and Swiss regulators, and have banned the use of online chatrooms. US agencies have launched another criminal inquiry. The SFO inquiry is ‘at an early stage’. HSBC and RBS are among six banks fined over allegations traders were fixing foreign exchange rates . Mr Usher’s friend said he and the traders said to be involved were being scapegoated. He said: ‘To the layman it [the chatroom] doesn’t look very nice. But Richard and the other guys were paid by the banks to meet targets and make money. They were incentivised to talk to other banks. ‘When you look at what the banks have said about accepting these £2.6billion fines … they’re not accepting any misconduct. When criticised by the FCA, the banks have just rolled over and said they’ll pay the fine, to get rid of this quickly. It’s a drop in the ocean to them – and they’re scapegoating a few individuals.’ He added: ‘There are many people who have done things that would be seen as more worrying than what Richard and Rohan Ramchandani have done.’ A senior source at JP Morgan said: ‘Richard Usher’s name keeps coming up over this alleged collusion. People here are furious and disappointed.’ The activity attacked by regulators involved the foreign exchange market, in which official ‘fix’ exchange rates, for example between the pound and the dollar, are determined by a snapshot of the trades taking place in the minute starting 30 seconds before 4pm in London, and finishing 30 seconds after. Traders allegedly worked together to ensure the rates were fixed to their massive financial advantage. Mr Ramchandani refused to comment on the claims. Mr Usher’s lawyer also refused to comment. A spokesman for JP Morgan would only say he no longer worked there.","Richard Usher, 39, is said to be at the heart of allegations of rigging rates .

"A school has banned teachers from marking in red pen because is it judged a ‘very negative colour’. Teachers at Mounts Bay Academy near Penzance, Cornwall, have reportedly been told to use green pens instead. Pupils, meanwhile, are being asked to comment on marking using purple pens. A school has banned teachers from using red ink to mark students' work because it is a 'very negative colour' According to The Cornishman, the new system is designed to encourage dialogue between teachers and students. ‘Switching to the new marking system is certainly not about us going all soft and fuzzy,' vice principal Jennie Hick told the paper. She said that the system will see teachers make ‘two or three positive comments’ about homework. It is hoped this will encourage pupils to not just look for their overall marks, but get them to respond with comments of their own. 'Switching to the new marking system is certainly not about us going all soft and fuzzy,' Mounts Bay vice principal Jennie Hick said . She told the paper: ‘I think it was felt that red ink was a very negative colour.’ However, Campaign for Real Education chairman Chris McGovern told the paper that, in fact, students prefer red ink because it makes comments easier to read. He said: ‘A lot of schools seem to have a culture where they don’t like criticising children but actually this helps them.’","Teachers at Mounts Bay Academy near Penzance, Cornwall, told red is a 'very negative colour'

"'Caged animal': Natalie Harvey, 19, with boyfriend Wayne Kinvig, 20, could have to give birth in jail . A tearaway teenage mother could have to give birth to her second child in jail after behaving like a ‘caged animal’ during a reign of terror. Natalie Harvey, 19, became a mother aged 16 and brought misery to her hometown of Burnley, Lancashire, with a campaign of abuse and intimidation against shoppers and council staff. She already had 26 convictions - several for violence - and was issued with an Asbo banning her from her regular haunts in the town, including a shopping centre and a public library. Now Harvey is 29 weeks pregnant by her serial conman boyfriend Wayne Kinvig, 20, who has already served jail terms for charity scams after getting cash out of elderly victims by claiming he was collecting for a sick little brother. Last Friday, Harvey was hauled back to court after launched a ‘shocking’ attack on a woman in a busy McDonald’s restaurant. A judge adjourned her case for reports but warned her she faced giving birth behind bars at HMP Styal, a women’s prison in Cheshire. She received an interim Asbo in November last year after police said she was ‘out of control’ and regularly causing trouble across Burnley. She was due to face a full Asbo hearing which would have heard the full extent of her offending. But four days later she got a supervision order for assaulting a woman called Ann-Marie Gornall and resisting a police officer. She was also arrested on suspicion of kidnapping and a sexual offence. Mugshots: Harvey (left), of Burnley, Lancashire, is 29 weeks pregnant by her serial conman boyfriend Kinvig (right), who has already served jail terms for charity scams after getting cash out of elderly victims . The latest offence in McDonald’s occurred when Harvey spotted Miss Gornall and told her: ‘You’re going to get stabbed up - why have you got me done? You are going to get me sent down for this.’ When Miss Gornall tried to leave, Harvey grabbed her, pulled her to the floor and kicked her. Burnley Crown Court heard how one horrified diner shouted to Harvey: ‘This is a public place.’ He told police the assault was completely unprovoked, malicious and quite shocking. Staff and customers went to assist Miss Gornall, who did not suffer any visible injuries. Harvey, who made no comment when questioned by police, admitted witness intimidation. Troubled: Harvey became a mother at 16 and brought misery to her hometown of Burnley, with a campaign of abuse and intimidation against shoppers and council staff . High street: Harvey has been given an Asbo banning her from a shopping centre and public library in Burnley . In mitigation, her barrister Tim Brennand said his client was recently robbed of £2,000 at knifepoint, and added that Harvey was a ‘product of the care system’. 'She behaved almost like a caged animal. Although she didn’t know it, she was crying out for help and attention' Tim Brennand, defending . She was fostered and placed into care at the age of three, had been moved from institution to institution and became a mother at the age of 16. She had also recently discovered her biological father had been murdered. ‘There had been issues in relation to substance abuse, no stability, no job, no parental figure and no control,’ said Mr Brennand. ‘When I first met her, she had poor eye contact, was rebellious, had clear disregard for her social worker and seemed to resent and resist efforts being made to help and assist her. ‘She behaved almost like a caged animal. Although she didn’t know it, she was crying out for help and attention. She has exasperated just about everyone who has offered her help.

"A convicted cannabis grower who attacked two students was spared jail – so he could get married and go on his honeymoon. Unemployed Lee Moss, 40, was already serving a 12-month suspended sentence for running a drug farm when he punched two young men in a takeaway following a night out. Although Moss should have been sent to prison for breaching the terms of his sentence, a judge said jailing him would ‘ruin his life’ and freed him. Free: A judge spared Lee Moss, right, a jail term so he would be free to marry long-term partner Michelle Bell, left, despite a vicious and unprovoked attack on two students . Judge Andrew Woolman, sitting at . Preston Crown Court, handed Moss a six-week home curfew, ending in time . for his big day and honeymoon to Egypt next month. The judge said: ‘It would destroy your . life in the short term if I was to imprison you immediately – you would . not be able to attend your wedding.’ Moss, who the court heard had also . failed to complete the community service element of his sentence, is due . to marry his long-standing girlfriend, Michelle Bell, 39, on June 24. The couple, who have two children . together, had already paid a ‘large amount’ towards the ceremony and are . due to go on an 11-day honeymoon on June 29. Jeremy Grout-Smith, prosecuting, told . the hearing that Moss’s victims – students Paul Larkin, 20, and Joshua . Kareem, 19 – had spent the evening of March 7 at the Old Dog pub in . Preston. They stopped at a takeaway on their way home, when, at around 4am, they were attacked by Moss, who had been drinking. ‘They were in the takeaway, sitting . waiting, when a man they didn’t know, the defendant, approached Mr . Larkin,’ Mr Grout-Smith said. ‘He [Moss] said something to him, . which he couldn’t recall, grabbed him by the shoulders, then punched him . to the face, causing a swollen lip. ‘The incident was captured on CCTV, . which shows Moss punching him in the mouth without provocation, and then . he attempts to hit him again, but misses and hits Mr Kareem.’ Police . were called to the scene and arrested Moss, who was carrying half a gram . of cocaine. When questioned, Moss claimed the . students had been guilty of ‘offensive behaviour’ earlier in the . evening. But, Mr Grout-Smith, said: ‘There is no evidence to support . that.’ Mr Kareem, who later made a claim for . compensation, told police he suffered bruising and pain down the side of . his face for three days after the attack, and back pain. Mr Grout-Smith added: ‘He said the incident had made him very wary and frightened of going out in Preston at night.’ Moss admitted two offences of assault and possession of a Class A drug. The court heard he had three previous . convictions, two of which involved drugs. In 2008, Moss was cautioned . for possession of a Class A drug and, in August last year, he received a . 12-month jail sentence, suspended for 12 months, for producing a Class B . drug after police discovered a cannabis factory in Blackburn. Smirking: Judge Andrew Woolman ruled that if he imprisoned Lee Moss, right, causing the postponement of his wedding to Michelle Bell, left, it would 'destroy' his life in the short term . Moss claimed he had set up the factory, which included 91 plants and 35 seedlings, because he owed money to drug dealers. Edmund Haygarth, defending, said Moss . assaulted the students because he thought they were among a group of . young men he had seen ‘bullying’ a young girl earlier in the evening. However, he later admitted being high on drink and cocaine and that it could have been a case of mistaken identity. Mr Haygarth said Moss was trying to . find work as a labourer, but that he had not completed unpaid work, part . of his previous sentence, because of a bad knee injury. Moss was sentenced to four months in . jail, suspended for two years. The judge also extended his existing . suspended sentence for growing cannabis to two years. It is understood Miss Bell had taken out a £10,000 loan to pay for the couple’s wedding and honeymoon. Last night Moss, who has two sons aged nine and four, said the judge had ‘saved his life’ by allowing him to walk free. He added: ‘We both feared the worst . and Michelle has been a nervous wreck. I was so sure I wouldn’t be going . on the honeymoon I told her to look at taking a friend.’","Lee Moss was serving 12-month suspended sentence for growing a cannabis farm when he launched vicious attack.

"Jailed: Arnie Rogers, 23, described his driving as 'careless mischief' when he was arrested by police following the fatal crash in Swindon in May . A driver who killed another motorist in a hit-and-run accident said 'that's £9,000 down the drain' after being told his car had been written off in the fatal crash, a court heard. Arnie Rogers, 23, was driving at more than 70mph in a 40mph zone when he 'obliterated' a car being driven by 61-year-old Peter Winters. Mr Winters' 33-year-old son, Paul, died after being thrown out of the passenger seat while Mr Winters, who was trapped in the wreckage, suffered multiple injuries and  fell into a coma. Rogers abandoned his Vauxhall Astra and fled the scene in Swindon, Wiltshire, after the accident in May. He was arrested less than three hours later while sleeping on a friend's sofa. When officers told him that his car had been wrecked he said: 'That's £9,000 down the drain then.' He was jailed for six years and eight months at Swindon Crown Court on Friday after pleading guilty to causing death by dangerous driving. Judge Peter Blair QC described the quip as 'despicable'. He told Rogers: 'Your recklessness gave Paul Winters a death sentence and his father Peter terrible injuries. 'Your driving in the moments before the collision was frighteningly dangerous. You offered no attempt to help your victims or stay at the scene to warn other drivers. 'I cannot fail to mention the despicable comments you made when you didn't even ask about the welfare of your victims.' The father and son were driving to a car boot sale in their Nissan shortly after 6.20am when they were hit by Rogers, who had left a nightclub in the centre of Swindon at 3am. Other road users saw Rogers driving erratically through the town, tailgating and overtaking at high speed. Hannah Squire, prosecuting, told the court: 'One road user describes the car as carrying out chicane movements in and out of the traffic, and the driver as irresponsible, dangerous, and stupid.' Mr Winters was turning into a retail park when Rogers' Vauxhall jumped a red light and smashed into his car. The collision report showed the Astra was travelling between 76 and 87mph at the time of impact and the Winters' Nissan was driving at 12mph. Witnesses said they saw two men, Rogers and his passenger, run away from the accident. Miss Squire said: 'When Peter woke [from his coma] he was told of the death of his son. Peter remembers nothing of the accident and was in intensive care for two and a half weeks. 'He suffered serious internal injuries with fractured ribs and a broken collar bone.' 'Obliterated': Peter Winters, 61, was driving the Nissan that was struck by Rogers in the hit-and-run. His son, 33-year-old Paul, died after being thrown out of the passenger seat. Above, the Winters' car after the crash . 'Dangerous': Other road users saw Rogers driving erratically through the town - tailgating and overtaking at high speed before he crashed into the Winters' car. Above, part of their Nissan at the scene of the accident . Rogers was arrested at 9am at a flat in Swindon as he slept on the sofa in blood-stained clothes, the court heard. Miss Squire said: 'Once he got to the police station he asked how his car was looking,' said Miss Squire. 'When told it was a wreck he said, ""Well that's £9,000 down the drain"". He described his driving as 'careless mischief'. 'There is a lack of remorse shown at the scene or any responsibility for his actions.' In his victim impact statement, Peter Winters, who is still recovering from his injuries, said: 'At my age I may never recover fully. 'The most devastating impact is the loss of my son, Paul, and not a minute goes by when I do not think of him. It is not possible to put into words how devastating this has been for my family.' Rob Ross, defending Rogers, said his client was regarded as a hard worker and normal lad. 'It is apparent to me that he feels genuinely aghast at what he caused,' he told the court. 'He accepts he drove like an idiot. Whatever comes out of this will show other young men that motor vehicles are dangerous.' The court was told that Rogers, of Swindon, has previous convictions from September 2010 for drink driving, driving without insurance and failing to stop after an accident for which he was banned for driving for 19 months. He was handed a further ten-year driving ban at the hearing on Friday.","Arnie Rogers, 23, jumped a red light and crashed into a car in Swindon .

"Attack: Retired nurse Llinos Rees, 61, who was caught on camera attacking her own mother . A son who suspected that his elderly mother was being abused installed a hidden camera which revealed his own sister spitting in her face. The footage caught Llinos Rees, 61, attacking their elderly mother Mary Gwen Jones, a court heard. The retired nurse was filmed ripping her mother's clothes, repeatedly spitting, screaming and elbowing her. Mrs Jones' son Arwel Jones had the camera fitted in the kitchen because he feared she was being attacked. The victim had been living on her own in Denbigh, North Wales, since her husband died 18 years ago and is frail but in good health. Prosecutor Rhian Jackson told magistrates at Prestatyn that Mrs Jones told her son that his sister had been behaving badly towards her, screaming at her whenever she visited. He noticed that she was very upset after each of his sister’s visits. Since retiring last year after 42 years . as a nurse Rees visited her mother more frequently and, according to Mrs . Jones, was verbally aggressive. After speaking to social workers, Mr Jones decided to install a covert CCTV camera and on May 21 his mother asked him to visit as Rees had been worse than ever. She had been yelling at her and calling her a 'b****'. Mrs Jackson told the court: 'Arwel Jones was shocked and distressed by the footage.' When interviewed by police, Rees said she had never got on with her brother but admitted spitting and losing her temper. Dafydd Roberts, defending, said it was a sad case not only because the victim was a vulnerable 91-year-old but also because the defendant was highly regarded in her community and the offence was totally out of character. Carer attack: Llinos Rees, 61,was filmed ripping her mother's clothes, repeatedly spitting, screaming and elbowing her . He said she had taken unpaid leave to care for her mother some years ago when she was diagnosed with cancer. 'But there has been disagreement within the family for some time,' he said. 'Mr Jones also provided some care, but not as much as my client.' Mr Roberts said that Rees had 'simply been ground down' by the stress and criticism and he submitted several character references. Rees, of Peniel, near Denbigh, wept after admitting assault at an earlier hearing. Chairman Isfryn Williams, imposed a 12 month community sentence, and said: 'It is a very sad case and I think everybody can relate to it in some way.' Rees was ordered to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work and attend five sessions on stress management. Magistrates also imposed a 12-month restraining order preventing Rees from visiting her mother except with a member of her family present.","Retired nurse Llinos Rees, 61, was secretly filmed attacking her mother Mary Gwen Jones .

"A serial shoplifter has been arrested for the 109th time, for allegedly snatching an armful of teeth-whitening products. Prolific Nathaniel Ferguson, 49, was picked up by officers in the Cleveland, Ohio, suburb minutes after he allegedly grabbed the dental cosmetics from a CVS drug store and bolted through the open door. His latest arrest prompted South Euclid Police Department to quip: 'Does anyone have a contact at the Guinness Book of World Records?' The career - if unsuccessful - criminal - has 108 prior arrests, as well as three active warrants with South Euclid Municipal Court and four other outstanding warrants. Career criminal: Nathaniel Ferguson, 49, was this week arrested for the 109th time . Petty thief: After he was picked up, officers found he also had seven outstanding warrants for his arrest . 'I don’t have anything on me,' the 49-year-old shouted at a security guard as he darted out, authorities told the New York Daily News. But employees already know Ferguson well - he'd stolen from there in the past and is reportedly banned from all CVS stores - and immediately called police. Officers arrived to find Ferguson taking off in a Green Mercury. They soon caught up and, as the vehicle pulled over, one watched Ferguson 'make several furtive movements as if hiding something under the driver's seat,' an arrest report says. Questioned at the scene, Ferguson allegedly gave his brother's name. He was placed under arrest for the lie after another officer arrived who recognized his face. A search turned up $47.26-worth of CVS brand teeth whitening products, as well as two crack pipes. The items found corresponded to those reported stolen by the security guard at CVS. 'Probably the majority of his arrests are just like that,' Sergeant Mike O’Connor told the Daily News. We've been here before: Ferguson's lengthy record means he has plenty of custody photos to share . Seasonal: That means we can see him in a range of outfits, including winter, left, and summer, right . Petty criminal: After his latest arrest, Ferguson was charged with stealing $47.26-worth of dental cosmetics . Drugs: Police also found two crack pipes that he admitted belong to him, the arrest record shows . Arrest records show Ferguson has given has given police no fewer than 26 aliases since he began his criminal career in 1984. Though they are mostly varied spellings of his name, they also include a few more inventive noms de crime such as Bruce Hogan and Nathan Hope. But his efforts have been largely futile; there are by now few police officers or security guards who don't know him at a glance, police said. As well as the three outstanding arrest warrants with South Euclid Municipal court, Ferguson was also wanted by the Highland Heights Police Department, the Cleveland Heights Police Department, the University Heights Police Department and the Cuyahoga County Sheriff's Office. He was charged with theft, falsification, criminal trespass and possession of drug paraphernalia.","South Euclid Police caught Nathaniel Ferguson as he fled the scene .

"Plastic surgeon Erik Scholten has been allowed back to work despite photographing a woman's genitals as he was about to perform surgery on her breast implants . A top plastic surgeon suspended for photographing a patient's genitals on his iPhone to add to his ‘portfolio of female genitalia’ has been allowed back to work. Dr Erik Scholten was about to replace a woman's breast implants at the private Fitzwilliam Hospital in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, when he took the photo without her consent, a court heard. The consultant, the UK’s leading specialist for female genital cosmetic and reconstructive surgery, was suspended for 18 months by the General Medical Council last April, pending investigation. But the GMC has now lifted the ban on practising and allowed Dr Scholten back to the operating theatre on tight conditions, including that he works with a chaperone. Dr Scholten, who has carried out more than 2,000 cosmetic surgical prodedures, applied to the High Court to have his suspension lifted, calling it ‘disproportionate’. Ruling on the case, Mr Justice Supperstone said Dr Scholten was about to operate on a woman in February last year when her genitals caught his eye through her surgical underpants. ‘He commented on this anatomical feature to the staff present in the theatre and stated that he intended to photograph it,’ the judge added. ‘He took a single photograph of the patient's genitals, with the surgical underpants pulled aside and her legs in a natural position, together. He used the camera on his iPhone. ‘He did not have the patient's prior consent to take the photograph.’ A ward matron found out about the . photo and confronted Dr Scholten, who apologised and wrote to the . patient, insisting he took the picture with the best intentions . regarding her ‘care pathway’. Dr . Scholten said his interest was professional, adding: ‘I am always . adding to my portfolio of different female genitalia to show prospective . patients and I was hoping, with your consent, to do so with yours. Incident: Dr Erik Scholten was about to replace a woman's breast implants at the private Fitzwilliam Hospital (pictured) in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, when he took the photo without her consent, a court heard . Decision: The consultant was suspended for 18 months by the General Medical Council (headquarters in London pictured) last April, pending investigation . 'I am always adding to my portfolio of different female genitalia to show prospective patients and I was hoping, with your consent, to do so with yours. I would have discussed this with you and, of course, had you objected, I would have disposed of the imagery immediately' Dr Erik Scholten . ‘I would have discussed this with you and, of course, had you objected, I would have disposed of the imagery immediately.’ The hospital suspended Dr Scholten from practising there last March, finding he ‘acted inappropriately’, was in breach of good medical practice in failing to respect the patient's dignity and that his actions had the potential to bring the hospital into disrepute. Dr Scholten was suspended for 18 months by the GMC but, at the High Court, his lawyer, Clodagh Bradley, argued the incident was isolated and there was no evidence of any risk of harm to patients. Mr Justice Supperstone accepted the panel had failed to properly hold the balance between patients' rights and the devastating impact of the suspension on Dr Scholten and, in the light of that ruling, the GMC has now allowed him back to work. The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service - the GMC's new tribunal service for UK doctors which came into force last June - replaced the interim suspension with a conditional registration order. He can now practise again so long as he tells the body when he accepts a job, confines himself to plastic surgery, consults with female patients in the presence of another medic and refrains from photographing female genitalia without consent.","Dr Erik Scholten was about to replace the woman's breast implants .

"Seven years after the financial crisis that shook Wall Street and unleashed a wave of debt carnage, many American cities have never recovered. America's once-proud industrial heartlands, once home to large middle-class communities, now lie practically in ruins, while areas that have always had problems with poverty face an ever-greater climb to prosperity. In some, whole neighborhoods lie crumbling, foreclosed and vacant after the eviction of legions of subprime borrowers. In others, jobless rates have soared and incomes plummeted, leaving those left behind struggling to eke out a living. California-based online research group FindTheBest.com has now compiled a list of the U.S. cities with the biggest communities of poor people, ranked by the percentage of households making less than $25,000 a year. The data is from the the Five-Year American Community Survey, released in December by the U.S. Census Bureau. 1. Detroit, Michigan . Once an economic powerhouse thanks to its famous auto industry, Detroit's decline began long before the U.S. housing bubble burst as car makers fled to cheaper destinations overseas. Between 2000 and 2010 the city's population fell by 25 percent, changing its ranking from the nation's 10th-largest city to 18th. As a result, many neighborhoods now lie abandoned. In 2013 the city declared bankruptcy, becoming the largest U.S. city ever to do so. 2. Milwaukee, Wisconsin . Milwaukee is another victim of America's shift to a post-industrial economy. Previously the workshop which made many of America's most-iconic products, including saddles, tractors and motors, Milwaukee's collapse has taken decades and is still taking it's toll on the city, where poverty rates soared close to 30 per cent in the throes of the past recession. 3. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania . America's fifth-most populous city, and an iconic part of the nation's revolutionary history, Philadelphia began its economic decline in the 1950s, when industrial restructuring led to the loss of many middle-class jobs and a gradual exodus of nearly a quarter of its population. In recent years gentrification and a expanding tourist and service industries have led to some revitalization of the centre, but many parts remain desperately poor. 4. Memphis, Tennessee . With nearly half the city's children living below the poverty line, Memphis is one of the worst American cities to grow up in. But the economic fate of the city's people depends in large part on the colour of their skin: a report last year by Elena Delavega at the University of Memphis noted that nearly a third of blacks and almost half of Latinos in the city live below the poverty line, compared to just one in ten whites. Even as overall poverty rates in the city declined last year, the rates among children and Latinos have increased, Ms Delavega reported. And the racial gap is widening: 'An interesting observation is that poverty rates among non-Hispanic Whites are now much lower in Memphis and Shelby County than in the state or the nation as a whole,' Dr Delavega wrote. 5. Tucson, Arizona . Tucson was hard particularly hard by the Great Recession, with jobless rates almost tripling between 2007 and 2010, according to Arizona state government data. Between 2007 and 2011 poverty rates rose nearly 8 percentage points to 26.6 percent, well above the 15.3 percent national average. 6. Baltimore, Maryland . With one in ten of working age people unemployed, a high cost of living and a low growth rate, Baltimore has become one of the hardest cities to survive in. Susan Roll, professor at the University of Maryland School of Social Work, told the Baltimore Sun several years ago that working poor are 'everywhere' in the city. 'They're not just people living in shelters,' she said. 'They're the person who poured your coffee. ... They're cleaning your office when you're not there.' 7. Fresno, California . Essentially a massive farming town, Fresno has always been dependent on low-paying agricultural labour. Just one in five of people over 25 have a college degree, while nearly a quarter never even finished high school. That means massive disparity between the haves and the have-nots. 'If you own a farm, you're apt to earn more wealth, while if you're a farm worker, your don't earn very much,' said Caroline Farrell, executive director of the Center on Race, Poverty & the Environment in an Associated Press interview in 2012. At that time, Fresno had the second highest poverty rates in the whole United States. 8. El Paso, Texas . A city of migrants, seven in 10 of El Paso citizens over five speak a language other than English at home, reports the U.S. Census Bureau, while one in four were born overseas. More than 20 per cent of peope live in poverty. 9. Indianapolis, Indiana . Another city battered by the financial crisis, the number of children living in poverty in Indianapolis has soared by more than 40percent since 2005, reports the Annie E. Casey Foundation. Meanwhile, social mobility statistics render the American Dream a joke for many people in the city, with just a 4.9percent chance that a person born into the poorest fifth of the income distribution will make it into the richest fifth. 10. Boston, Massachusetts . Although close to half the city's working-age adults have a college degree, Boston has a poverty rate well above the national average - a situation that has only become worse in many of the city's poorest neighborhoods. It is the fourth-most unequal big city in the whole of the US, with the richest 5percent earning more than 15 times the income of the poorest fifth. Low wages blight Boston's economy, with 41 per cent of its people earning below a University of Massachusetts'  low-wage definition of $30,600 a year - mostly those in retail, health and social care and education. 11.

"France Football magazine has stoked the fires ahead of Chelsea's visit to Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League on Tuesday night by branding Jose Mourinho a 's***-stirrer.' The Blues manager features on the front cover of their latest edition with the unflattering nickname 'L'Emmerdeur', which translates as a 'pain in the neck.' But inside, in their preview of the last 16, first leg clash at the Parc des Princes, they label Mourinho 'l'emerdeur professionnel' or the aforementioned insult. France Football magazine have labelled Jose Mourinho a 'pain in the neck' and a 's***-stirrer' ahead of Chelsea's Champions League tie with Paris Saint-Germain . Mourinho gives a cheeky smile during his pre-match press conference ahead of the match at Parc des Princes . And even PSG's official Twitter account has joined in the pre-match 'banter', posting mocked-up pictures of the Queen and Winston Churchill wearing scarves in their club colours. They started on Monday night with a Photoshopped image of the bronze statue of the wartime British Prime Minister on Avenue Winston-Churchill in the heart of Paris. The 10ft high statue, which was unveiled by the Queen in 1998, is shown with a PSG scarf around the neck. And the French champions followed that up with a likeness of the Queen in the Musee Grevin wearing a red, blue and white scarf around her neck. Their message read: 'Hey @ChelseaFC, it seems like W. Churchill is not the only one ready for tonight... #GodSaveTheQueen #ADifferentStory'. The 'different story' hastag is in reference to last season's Champions League quarter-finals, when Chelsea eliminated PSG on the away goals rule after the tie ended 3-3 on aggregate. On Monday, they tweeted a message saying: 'Revenge is a dish best served... one year later.' Despite the 'banter', PSG are very much the underdogs entering the match. Laurent Blanc's side are in the grip of an injury crisis, with Yohan Cabaye, Marquinhos, Lucas Moura and Serge Aurier suffering knocks in their weekend draw with Caen. While PSG sit third in Ligue 1, behind leaders Lyon and Marseille, Chelsea are seven-points clear at the Premier League summit and had the luxury of a free weekend following their early exit from the FA Cup.","Chelsea play Paris Saint-Germain in Champions League on Tuesday night .

"A High Street bank may stop asking customers for their mother’s maiden name to avoid confusing account-holders with two dads, it was reported last night. A review of RBS’ ‘inclusion’ policies aimed at gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender customers could also include introducing the gender-neutral ‘Mx’ instead of the traditional Mr, Mrs, Miss or Ms, it emerged last night. Bank staff are also being trained in speaking to customers who inform them they are changing gender, according to the Times. RBS staff may be told to stop asking customers for their mother's miaden names to avoid confusing account-holders who may have two fathers . The bank’s global head of inclusion Marjorie Strachan said questions about maiden names would be tough for those with two mothers or fathers. She todl the Times: ‘We are looking at unconscious bias. If we think about something as simple as using neutral language, that can be a good starting point.’ And of the ‘Mx’ title, she said: ‘We have considered it. It’s something we’re looking at as one of the options, although we’ve usually followed the same nomenclature that the census would use.’ Speaking about addressing customers undergoing a gender change, she said: ‘We recognise it can be extremely upsetting if a customer who is undergoing gender re-assignment walks into a branch and doesn’t have an easy option in explaining their needs.’ Other High Street banks - Lloyds and Barclays - are also looking again at the way they speak with gay, lesbian and transgender account-holders. A Lloyds spokesman said: ‘We continually review our policies and procedures in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity to ensure we are meeting the needs of our LGBT customers and colleagues.’ Lloyds said it was also reviewing the way it speaks with gay, lesbian and transgender account-holders . A spokesman for Stonewall, the gay equality campaign group, told the newspaper: ‘The best businesses in 21st-century Britain are ones who respond to the needs of all their customers, that includes LGBT people, people with two dads or people who change their gender.’ Last week, Antonio Simoes, the openly gay UK chief executive of HSBC, urged business leaders to be more open about their sexual orientation. He said: ‘We’re in London, we’re in 2014. It’s not acceptable that we take for granted all the work done by others on issues such as marriage equality. ‘There’s a huge personal responsibility to come out and to be out.’","Bank has reviewed 'inclusion' policies aimed at LGBT customers .

"Every foreign prisoner deported from Britain is replaced in jail by another criminal from overseas, a damning report revealed today. While 1,000 inmates are sent home every three months, the same number of new foreign offenders are locked up by the courts. Parliament’s spending watchdog condemned the Government's ‘frustratingly poor’ record on kicking out foreign criminals who are costing taxpayers hundreds of millions of pounds. There are almost 11,00 foreign criminals in jail, and those deported are replaced by new inmates . Four years ago David Cameron promised a crackdown after it emerged that more than 11,000 foreign inmates are clogging up our jails. But since then almost no progress has been made in bringing the number down. The Commons Public Accounts Committee found that the rate foreign inmates are sent home has dropped by 14 per cent over the past four years. The committee's chair, Labour MP Margaret Hodge, said: ‘Performance in reducing the number of foreign national prisoners continues to be frustratingly poor, costing the taxpayer hundreds of millions of pounds. ‘While more than 1,000 foreign national offenders are deported each quarter, a similar number are convicted, so the overall number of foreign national prisoners stays at the same level of around 11,000 – 13 per cent of the total prison population. ‘The agency should work with the Home Office to understand why there are delays in removing foreign national offenders, and tackle the barriers to their removal.’ Top 10 countries foreign prisoners come from . In December, the National Audit Office said speeding up the removal of foreign prisoners was the best way to reduce the bill for jails. The PAC said the National Offender Management Service (Noms) ‘should work with the Home Office to better understand the reasons for delays in removing foreign national offenders, tackle the barriers to removal, and take all steps to improve performance in this area’. Justice Minister Jeremy Wright said: ‘The foreign national prisoner population is lower than it was in 2010 and reducing it further is a top priority for this Government. ‘We are working hard to reduce the numbers in our prison system - in 2012 alone we deported more than 4,500 foreign criminals from the UK.’ But Labour’s shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said: ‘David Cameron's terrible record on failing to send home foreign prisoners also rightly comes in for criticism. ‘Back in 2010, he promised to personally intervene to send thousands back to their home countries. ‘With only a handful actually sent back, this broken promise is clogging up our jails and costing taxpayers hundreds of millions of pounds.’","1,000 inmates deported every three months, but same number locked up .

"A heroic brother and sister have been honoured with a bravery award after working together to save their dad's life, after he collapsed on the floor of their Brisbane home. Jonathon Porter, 8, and his little sister, Cheyenne, 6, were at their Mount Gravatt home, south east of the city, with their father last year when he started having a diabetic seizure. In what has been seen as an extraordinary action of bravery, Seven News said the two siblings sprang into action, Jonathon calling triple zero while sister Cheyenne stayed by her father's side, Glenn.

'They're just called a serious low and all we can do is just call the ambulance,' said the eight year old calmly. The operator was then able to work out he was a diabetic and instructed the children to roll their father on his side and administer first aid before the ambulance arrived. The emergency involving their father comes after the death of their mother, who recently died of Cancer, but she left them with very important instructions that saved the life of their dad.

"One in three workers would prefer more holidays to a pay rise and most believe that the promise of extra time off would motivate them to switch jobs, according to a report. A survey of almost 8,000 adults in 24 countries found that those in Britain and Europe had more holiday time than workers in the Asia Pacific region and North America. It found that 61 per cent of Britons said the chance for more holiday time would motivate them to change employer. A third of workers would prefer more holidays to a pay rise and 61% said the chance for more holiday time would motivate them to change employer . The highest number of days offered to staff is 30 in Denmark, France, Germany and Spain, 28 in Italy, and 26 in Britain. In comparison, holidays totalled 15 days in the US and Mexico, and just 11 in Thailand, according to the study for travel website Expedia. The average is 28 in Europe the researchers found, but added that the Italians take only 21 out of their entitled 28 days off, with Britons taking 25 out of their 26. Workers in South Korea took only seven of 15 available days in the past year. Andy Washington, of Expedia.co.uk, said: 'While habits differ, the emotional impact of holiday does not. 'Somewhere between 80 per cent and 90 per cent of people worldwide say that holidays make them feel happier, better rested, closer to their family, less stressed and more relaxed.'

"Rising numbers of doctors, dentists, vets and lawyers are becoming ‘functioning alcoholics’, experts warn. Addiction specialists have given them that label because they do not fit the typical image of down-and-out street drinkers. There has been a surge in demand from professionals seeking rehab treatment abroad to avoid being recognised in nearby hospitals or clinics, it is claimed.

"A psychologist and sex therapist has spoken out about gender-neutral parenting - the act of raising a child without the traditional confines or stereotypes of gender. Bettina Arndt has deemed the concept 'doomed for failure' in an interview set to air on Channel Seven's Sunday Night this weekend. The psychologist - who has served on many government advisory committees - also criticised the way we as a society raise men, saying women expect too much from their male partners. Scroll down for video . Psychologist Bettina Anrdt has spoken out against gender-neutral parenting saying it's 'doomed for failure' 'As we discovered, back in the 70s there were a lot of women who, feminists, women in the women's movement who decided they were going to try to do that sort of thing, a lot of us have realized we are really up against it because, I think there is no question there is something biological,' she told the program. 'I think it's doomed to failure.' Ms Ardnt added that the shift away from traditional male roles in relationships means men don't have as much of a voice within the family unit and this can be damaging to them, citing the difference between the way children were brought up in the 1950s and the present. Dare Jennings said he is committed to nurturing male behaviours and said traditional male gender roles helped men figure out where they fit in . 'There was just an assumption that father’s had a voice, but I think a lot of mums are making all the decisions about how their children are raised, and I don’t know where dad’s voice has actually gone now,' the psychologist said. Ms Arndt also revealed she believes that women expect too much from men and they shouldn't be expected to do everything. She said females have their expectations set too high, need to be more realistic, and shouldn't be in search of that 'soulmate'. Ms Arndt voiced her support for gendered roles and said women expect too much from men . Father and founder of iconic Australian surf brand Mambo Dare Jennings said he is committed to nurturing male behaviours and said traditional male gender roles helped men figure out where they fit in. He added that this attitude can lead men to apologetic for normal behaviour and forcing them to seek permission for things that they don't need it for.

"NBC's $25million man may be forced to take a dramatic cut in pay if the Today show viewership continues to fall. Plagued by plummeting ratings and a declining personal favorability, Matt Lauer may be asked to sacrifice his huge NBC paycheck if the Today show's situation doesn't improve. The morning show is taking a major hit in viewership following the tearful departure of former co-host Ann Curry in June. Trouble at Today? NBC is reportedly examining whether Matt Lauer, left, is worth what he's being paid after the show took a major hit in rating following the tearful departure of Ann Curry, right . The network is now reportedly examining whether Lauer is worth what he's being paid. A source close to the situation told Radar Online: 'Matt Lauer will be asked to take a significant cut in his $25million salary if TODAY doesn't win the key November sweeps.' 'The May and November sweeps dictate how much the networks can charge for advertising and they are extremely important to the bottom line. The TODAY show had always been a cash cow for NBC, generating hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue.' Radar reported that NBC Universal is now . looking at the budgets of the network’s shows, and seeing where cuts . can be made, and in the news division, a significant portion pays . Lauer's salary. Meet the new host: It has been reported that Willie Geist will join the Today show to to serve as co-host during the 9am hour . The network insider said: 'Matt's salary . is the biggest part of the TODAY show's budget and with Good Morning . America now routinely beating them, it's just hard to justify that . salary. Such a cut in pay is not unheard of at the network. Earlier this month, it was reported that late night host Jay Leno would be cutting his salary by 50 per cent to just $15million to combat budget cuts. Meanwhile, it has been reported that Morning Joe newsman Willie Geist will join the Today show to to serve as co-host during the 9am hour. The New York Times' Media Decoder blog reported that Geist will back up Lauer and will share hosting duties with Natalie Morales, Al Roker and Savannah Guthrie starting at 9am. The trouble began for Today with Ann Curry's unceremonious booting off the show back in June, after it was claimed that Lauer was responsible for getting her axed. Curry’s departure from her 'dream job' after just year in the role was tearful and on camera she told viewers that she had tried her best, although she apparently failed. The 55-year-old was promptly replaced by Guthrie, 40. But viewers were unimpressed with Curry’s treatment and Today has not had the audience ratings it was hoping for with Guthrie on the sofa. Viewership has been slipping away from the Today show as rival Good Morning America has been gaining ground, winning the ratings war for the past two weeks. Early data shows that the ABC morning show will most likely win for a third week, as well. Additionally, in the 10 weeks before Curry quit, Today got 4.94 million viewers, but in the 10 weeks since she left there were just 4.6 million. The moment Lauer lost his likability? Curry's unceremonious booting off the show has long been a thorn in Lauer's side, after it was claimed he was responsible for getting her axed . Adding to his grief over diminishing ratings, the New York Post ran an article on Wednesday about Lauer's domineering style at NBC. Sources told Page Six that Lauer is now 'running the show and he’s not listening to anyone,' causing a 'huge problem.' Another source lamented that the staff is overworked in an effort to catch up to GMA's ratings. 'Matt's telling the staff they don’t work hard enough, which is hard to take from a guy working four days a week, making millions,' the source told Page Six. Responding to Page Six’s request for comment, Lauer said: 'Please print this story - it's the most interesting and dangerous I've ever sounded!' Earlier this year, Lauer signed a contract reportedly worth $25 million to stay on the show.","Today show is taking a major hit in ratings following the departure of Ann Curry .

"A pensioner who was paralysed 11 years ago is claiming she can now walk again after experiencing a 'miracle' at a church in southern Italy. Michelina Comegna, 74, was struck by the 'miracle' during morning mass at a church in modern Pompei. 'I took communion and instantly felt a fire going from my feet up my legs and my whole body. At the same time, I was overcome by an intense scent of flowers', she said. Michelina Comegna, 74, was struck by the miracle during morning mass at the Shrine of the Virgin of the Rosary of Pompei . I forgot I was in church and looked around, convinced my clothes were on fire. I was covered in sweat, it was dripping from my head like water. I told my husband I was feeling an intense joy, and I needed to walk,' she said reported Gazzetta del Sud On Line. 'It was so strong, that I began to become scared. I forgot that I was in a church; because of the burning sensation I thought I was on fire.' In April 2003 she was paralysed following breast cancer surgery and a brain aneurysm that left her bed-ridden for three years. A mastectomy and several cycles of chemotherapy followed, and she spent the next 11 years in and out of a wheelchair, afflicted with partial paralysis. 'I took communion and instantly felt a fire going from my feet up my legs and my whole body. At the same time, I was overcome by an intense scent of flowers', she said (file photo) Ms Comegna has attended the Shrine of the Virgin of the Rosary of Pompei for years, but says it was not until taking communion at a service last month that her prayers were answered. Vicar Giuseppe Adamo confirmed he had witnessed the incident, although remained cautious about declaring a miracle and said the church was waiting for a medical report, reported The Local. Archbishop Tommaso Caputo, who is in charge of the cathedral, also urged caution. 'We must wait for conclusive scientific evidence. 'While many prodigious events have taken place in this sanctuary by the intercession of the Virgin Mary, it is up to medical science to produce the evidence to confirm them'. But Ms Comegna’s husband, Giovanni Passaro, insists his wife has received a miracle. 'I have seen a great miracle...it changed everything,' he was quoted as saying. 'She got up and quickly walked towards the nave. I asked her to stop, but she went and had no sign of paralysis.' In February a 20-year-old US college student who was paralysed in a sporting accident says he received messages from God telling him the exact day he would walk again - and he did.","Michelina Comegna, 74, was struck by the 'miracle' during a morning mass .

"Britain is to hand over an expected £600million more to fight global warming in the Third World including cash to build sea and flood defences. Angry MPs said last night that voters would not understand why money is being sent overseas when not enough has been done to shore up flood defences here. Earlier this year homes and fields in Somerset were flooded as a result of the wettest winter on record. Some local people believe the Environment Agency’s decision to stop dredging rivers was also a factor. Days ago pictures emerged of water rising again on the Somerset Levels. Scroll down for video . Britain is set to hand over hundreds of millions of pounds to fight build flood defences in the Third World despite fears that parts of the country will become submerged in water this winter. The River Parrett in Burrowbridge, Somerset, flooded 11 months ago and has already risen (pictured) The latest handout will be announced by David Cameron on Thursday, the day of the Rochester and Strood by-election. But many Tory MPs believe voters are sick of seeing taxpayers’ money sent abroad to tackle fashionable causes. The massive giveaway risks becoming a propaganda gift to Ukip which is confident of winning the by-election. The party has exploited public scepticism about climate change and the value of foreign aid. Some of the funding will go on flood defences amid fears that climate change will lead to more adverse weather. But Andrew Rosindell, Tory MP for Romford, said: ‘At a time when we in our own country have suffered from flooding and devastation, with potentially more to come, this doesn’t send out the right message. ‘The overwhelming mood in the country is that the first duty of government is to look after this country. It sends a confusing message to people affected by flooding here that we are spending so much on flood defences overseas rather than at home. I don’t think this will help us win the general election.’ Flooded fields near the village of Muchelney in Somerset which was completely submerged last winter . Residents are concerned not enough is being done to prevent flooding again this year in Somerset. A car and caravan can be seen in a flooded field in February . The donation will be handed to the new United Nations Green Climate Fund, which is being set up to help developing countries cut their carbon emissions and prepare for the effects of climate change. Government sources refused to disclose the exact size of the commitment last night, but confirmed it will run into ‘hundreds of millions of pounds’. The money is likely to be taken from Britain’s £11.5billion aid budget, part of which is earmarked for helping countries deal with climate change. Critics claimed handing more money to foreign flood defences 'did not send out the right message' One source indicated that Britain’s contribution is unlikely to be less than the amount given by France and Germany who have each pledged $1billion (£625 million). The US will donate $3billion. Mr Cameron initially appeared to suggest that Britain would not contribute to the new fund, saying the UK had ‘more than played its part’ in the fight against climate change. But, speaking at his closing press conference at the G20 summit in Brisbane yesterday, the Prime Minister confirmed a major donation would be announced this week. Mr Cameron insisted the cash was not ‘new money’ and attempted to play down the significance of the move. The Prime Minister said: ‘Britain has already set aside a substantial sum for green climate funds, and all we have to do now is decide how much of that already set aside money to put into this specific fund. ‘As ever in these things Britain will play its part and play a very constant part. ‘It’s been good that some other countries have been encouraged to come forward and put some money there. But everyone knows Britain will play our part because we’ve already set aside money, so when we make an announcement it won’t be new money.’ Peter Bone, Conservative MP for Wellingborough, said voters would not understand why their money was being ‘wasted’ in this way. ‘We have not got enough money to provide enough firefighters and police officers locally, so to spend £600million on what I would say is a wasted project just seems crackers,’ he said. Roger Helmer, Ukip’s energy spokesman, suggested Mr Cameron was engaged in a vanity exercise to maintain his standing among world leaders. Mr Helmer said: ‘Cameron is preparing to play “me too” with hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money. Money that could be better spent at home.’","David Cameron to offer more financial help to flood-prone countries .

"A postcard and a calendar from 1974 may finally prove a pensioner's claim that there has been a mix-up over the true identity of the model in Athena's famous 'Tennis Girl' poster. Photographer Martin Elliot always credited model Fiona Butler, his then girlfriend, as starring in the dream-like photograph taken on a sunny day in 1976. But Peter Atkinson has for 30 years claimed the bare bum in the picture, which became famous in the 1980s and decorated a generation of boys' bedrooms, in fact belonged to his ex-wife. And now, he says, he has found proof. The Tennis Girl: Athena's famous poster of a young woman bearing her bottom on a sun-soaked tennis court became one of the most-famous images in the world during the late 1970s and the 1980s . Controversy: But Peter Atkinson, a pensioner from Marsh Gate, Cornwall, claims the woman credited with being the model in the photograph, Fiona Butler, is wrong and that it in fact shows his ex-wife . 'Fiona [Butler] has always said she had a photo shoot with her knickers off with Martin,' said Mr Atkinson. 'She thinks that the photo shoot they had was the one that was used - that's not the case.' Exhibit A is a postcard Mr Atkinson bought off eBay showing the Tennis Girl picture, but stamped with a 1974 postmark - two years before Mr Elliot claims he shot the photograph. Exhibit B is a 1974 calendar unearthed by the pensioner. It is illustrated with a photograph so similar to the Tennis Girl shot it seems likely they could have been taken during the same shoot. The 72-year-old also claims that Mr Elliot, who died of cancer in 2010, had confessed to him in a meeting that Ms Butler is not the real Tennis Girl. 'Fiona was photographed by Martin Elliot, but that was years after the initial photo was taken,' Mr Atkinson said. 'Initially Martin photographed my ex-wife, and tried to flog it to the poster manufacturer Athena. 'Athena weren't interested to begin with, but eventually they came back to him and commissioned him to take the photo properly and lent him some professional gear.' Exhibit A: Mr Atkinson claims to have bought this postcard from eBay. Postmarked 1974, it nevertheless shows the unmistakable Tennis Girl image, which by the photographer's account wasn't taken until 1976 . Exhibit B: This 1974 calendar shows what appears to be another photograph from the same set as the Tennis Girl shot, which Mr Atkinson says is further evidence that the iconic photo was in fact a picture of his ex . Mr Atkinson says Mr Elliot did indeed recreate the original shoot four years later with Ms Butler, who was then 18 and the photographer's girlfriend. But the image that went global and adorned boys' walls around the world was from the original set, insists Mr Atkinson, and shows his ex-wife. A best-seller throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, Athena's Tennis Girl poster a worldwide impact. It was banned in several countries and even publicly torn to pieces in the Middle East as an example of Western sexual decadence. The girl in the photo, which remains popular to this day, remained anonymous until 1989, when Fiona Butler stepped forward to announce that she was the face behind the behind. Mr Elliot's story is that the shot was taken at the now defunct Birmingham University courts at Edgbaston on a hazy September afternoon in 1976. Chewed tennis balls belonging to Miss Butler's dog were scattered across the court. Mr Elliott went on to sell the image rights to Athena but retained the copyright, earning him an estimated £250,000 in royalty payments. Two million copies were sold worldwide. Miss Butler, who is now Mrs Walker and a mother-of-three, has previously said she had no regrets about posing for the photograph, even though she never earned a penny from it. But Mr Atkinson believes she had been misled by Mr Elliot. He says his ex-wife, to whom he was married between 1980 and 1986, revealed to him during their relationship that she had posed for the photograph while working as a tennis coach. Mr Elliot, one of her pupils, talked her into posing for him in a photo shoot in 1972, he says. The 'real' Tennis Girl: Fiona Walker - née Butler - poses with an original copy of the poster . His ex-wife wishes to remain anonymous, apparently because it was her word against the late Mr Elliot's, who had always refused to publicly acknowledge Mr Atkinson's claims. But before his death five years ago, Mr Elliot met the pensioner, who lives near Camelford, Cornwall, and allegedly admitted he had been lying. 'He confessed i to me - but I can't prove it,' Mr Atkinson said. 'He said that he would give it me in writing, on a postcard, but it never arrived.' Since Mr Elliot's death the royalties for the poster have been paid to his widow, Noelle Bott. The late photographer has previously said of the image: 'If I had a pound for ever model that has laid claim to being the girl, and every photographer that has claimed they took the photo, I'd be a very rich man.'","Peter Atkinson claims his ex-wife was the photographer's tennis coach .

"Held: The Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons, Tory MP Nigel Evans, has been arrested over allegations of rape and sexual assault relating to two men . The Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons was arrested yesterday over allegations of rape and sexual assault relating to two men. Nigel Evans was taken to a police station in Lancashire, where he is Conservative MP for Ribble Valley, and questioned over offences dating from 2009 to March this year. Forensic teams were searching his two homes in London and Pendleton, Lancashire, as part of their inquiries. Yesterday afternoon, they could be seen examining his white Saab convertible, which was parked near his constituency home. By last night, no charges had been made against Mr Evans, who came out as gay in a 2010 article for The Mail on Sunday. This is the latest, and potentially most explosive, in a series of high-profile arrests over allegations of a sexual nature, some of which go back more than 40 years. There have been wild rumours about the involvement of politicians – but until now, none has been arrested. The arrest of the Deputy Speaker, one of the most prestigious public positions in Britain, brings the matter right to the heart of the Establishment. Allegations against Mr Evans, 55, concern incidents that are said to have taken place from 2009 right up to a few weeks ago, spanning the entire period during which he has officiated over Commons debates in the famous Speaker’s chair. They are understood to relate to two men in their 20s. Both Speaker John Bercow and David Cameron have been told of the arrest. Mr Bercow said: ‘It’s been a total shock. 'Nigel is a popular and well-liked character. No one can quite believe what’s happened.’ A spokeswoman for Lancashire police told this newspaper yesterday: ‘A 55-year-old man from Pendleton in Lancashire has today been arrested by Lancashire Constabulary on suspicion of rape and sexual assault. 'The man will be interviewed at a police station in Lancashire during the course of the day. The offences are alleged to have been committed in Pendleton between July 2009 and March 2013. Arrested: Nigel Evans is pictured with David Cameron, who has been informed about the claims . Quizzed: Mr Evans is pictured posing with two dancers . Going home: Nigel Evans was last night driven from Preston police station after questioning by detectives . We take all allegations of a sexual . nature extremely seriously and understand how difficult it can be for . victims to have the confidence to come forward. ‘As . a constabulary, we are committed to investigating sexual offences . sensitively but robustly, recognising the impact that these types of . crimes have on victims. ‘We would encourage anyone who has experienced sexual abuse, or who has information about it, to have the confidence to report it to us knowing that we will take it seriously, deal with it sensitively and investigate it thoroughly.’ Thorough: Officers search the MP's white Saab convertible parked in his home village of Pendleton in Lancashire . Quaint: This image shows Mr Evans' village in Pendleton. His white Saab is pictured to the left of the stream in the distance . Inquiries: Police enter Mr Evans' house looking for evidence . She added: ‘Following the arrest, police . can confirm they are searching addresses in Pendleton and  London in . connection with the  investigation. The offences relate to two men.’ A Commons spokesman said: ‘This is a matter for the police and we will not be making any comment.’ Swansea-born Mr Evans, who worked in his family supermarket business before entering politics, has been a Tory MP since 1992. He held a series of senior posts and was Parliamentary Private Secretary to William Hague in 1996, when Hague was in the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Wales. In June 2010, he was elected as one of . Mr Bercow’s three deputies,  bringing his total parliamentary salary to . £102,000 a year. He has been tipped as a possible successor to the . Speaker’s job. Tory loyalist . Mr Evans is a strong supporter of Mr Cameron. Just two weeks ago, they . both took part in a photo-call to promote a campaign led by Microsoft . billionaire Bill Gates to eradicate polio. In . July 2010, Mr Evans chose to come out as gay in a candid article in The . Mail on Sunday. He timed it to mark the launch of a group set up to . help MPs and parliamentary staff be open about their sexuality. Mr Evans said he was ‘tired of living a lie’ and had, in the past, received threats of blackmail from political enemies threatening to expose him. He said: ‘The MP was saying to anyone . who would listen, “Why is it that Nigel Evans leads a life whereby he is . gay to some people and not others?”’ On patrol: Uniformed Lancashire Police officers maintain their presence in the village . Mr Evans refused to name the Labour politician, but added: ‘I could not afford it to be used as leverage against me. I couldn’t take the risk. I don’t want any other MP to face that kind of nastiness again. ‘I am sure there are other gay MPs who would like to be open about their sexuality but are fearful of the consequences. I hope this new group will help them to do so.’ Mr Evans’s decision to come out was . partly as a result of a chance conversation with a friend, the actress . Vicky Entwistle, who played Janice Battersby in Coronation Street and . who lives in Mr Evans’s Ribble Valley constituency. Making a stand: Mr Evans, left, is pictured with Speaker John Bercow, right, at last year's Gay Pride march . Fun: Mr Evans, left, poses for a photograph in front of the Houses of Parliament with members of the circus industry in March 2011 . Mr Evans said: ‘We went for a drink and she said to me, “You’re gay, aren’t you?” It’s a subject I avoid usually but Vicky is very natural and I told her I was. I thought to myself, “I am now telling people I am gay – it’s time I did something about it and told everyone.” ’ He was also encouraged by fellow Welshman and rugby union star Gareth Thomas, who came out in 2009. ‘If people like Gareth, who was married, can come out, it should be no big deal for me,’ said Mr Evans. In 1998, Mr Evans voted against lowering the age of gay consent from 18 to 16. Two years later, he voted in favour of the measure. The law was finally changed in 2001.

"Robyn Wardle, CEO for Family Planning NT, is calling for abortion pill RU486 to be made legal in the Northern Territory . An expert in family planning says the Northern Territory still have a 'cowboy mentality' because medical termination pill RU486 is still illegal in the state. Robyn Wardle, CEO for Family Planning NT, wants the pill to be legalised in the region so women don't have to wait until they are at least seven weeks pregnant for a surgical procedure where they will be put under anaesthetic. The NT is the only state in Australia that has not made the pills legal under the Medical Services Act. Family Planning NT say they have been campaigning the government for 12 months and seen no movement in their agenda. Ms Wardle told Daily Mail Australia: 'Our goal is to educate the health services and it's just so unfair that women in the NT don't have the same rights as those everywhere else in Australia.' 'Half the women who come into our clinics want the medical termination and we cannot offer it to them, it's a crime. 'It's just beyond me why this has not been reviewed, it's shocking, the government is working from a law that is 40 years old, so much has changed and modernised since then. 'The issue doesn't really come to anyone's attention unless you need that service yourself. 'The medical termination is less invasive and women don't have to wait weeks for an outcome. 'Once a woman has made the decision that she wants to have a termination she wants it done as quickly as possible and doesn't want to have to wait weeks, it's very disappointing for them. 'This law has needed to be changed for years. It is unfair for health staff having to work under a law that is so old. Medical abortion pill RU486 remains illegal in the Northern Territory under the Medical Services Act . Surgical termination is legal in the NT but it can only be  performed in a hospital by a gynaecologist, campaigners also want this word removed from legislation so more medical professionals can perform the procedure. Ms Wardle told Daily Mail Australia that there is just one doctor in Darwin who flies to the region from Adelaide each week to perform the surgical procedures. 'This is because we don't have enough doctors who are willing to perform it. The gynaecologists decide if they want to do them or not. 'There are no other doctors in the NT that are within the public health system that want to perform the terminations, there are a couple of doctors in the private sector who will do them but some women up here just cannot afford that.' Some women are resorting to buying the drug off the internet and taking it unsupervised at home without medical attention, Ms Wardle explained. She said: 'Women can buy this off the shelf in India and I have heard of cases where they are either getting it off the internet or family members have posted the drug up from other states in Australia. Ms Wardle said: 'Women can buy this off the shelf in India, we need to have it in the NT' 'When a woman is desperate she will do anything. I have also heard of women travelling interstate to have a medical abortion in Western Australia or Queensland. 'We have backpackers come to us when they have got pregnant and they can't believe we don't offer the pills, they think we are joking. 'Half the population of the NT are women and we should have the same choices and rights as the women across the country.' Ms Wardle said she believed the NT government had a 'flippant attitude' towards the drug and think it is an easy way out for a woman who is pregnant. Last year NT Health Minister Robyn Lambley told the NT News that the Cabinet had not discussed the legalisation of the drug properly and they were a 'long way off making a final decision'. A spokesman for Ms Lambley told Daily Mail Australia 'she has said before she is looking into it but there is no new statement coming out on it at the moment'.","Medical abortion pill RU486 remains illegal in the Northern Territory .

"Orbiting Earth at this very moment are thousands of chunks of space junk that pose a threat to satellites and spacecraft alike. To monitor this debris Japan is planning to launch a military space force by 2019 that will be tasked with protecting satellites. The initial goal of this new division will be to track the various pieces of junk and prevent satellites being damaged or destroyed by collisions in future. In five years Japan will assemble a space force to monitor junk in Earth orbit. The unit will use telescope and radar facilities in Japan's Okayama region. It will be made up of personnel from the country's Air Self-Defense Force with their F-15J Eagle aircraft picturing performing a flyover during an inspection parade in 2010 . Since the first object, Sputnik 1, was launched into space 53 years ago, mankind has created a swarm of hundreds of thousands of items of debris. The rubbish circling the planet comes from old rockets, abandoned satellites and missile shrapnel. There are around 22,000 objects in orbit that are big enough for officials on the ground to track and countless more smaller ones that could do damage to human-carrying spaceships and valuable satellites. One major source of debris in the past was a Chinese anti-satellite missile test in 2007 that left an estimated 150,000 pieces of junk in the atmosphere. Accidental events have also contributed to the problem. In 2009 for instance there was a major crash between a U.S. communications satellite and a defunct Russian military probe over Siberia. Space junk is a growing problem for travel into the cosmos. According to Nasa more than 500,000 pieces of debris are orbiting Earth at speeds of more than 17,500 miles (28,000 kilometres) per hour. At this speed a piece as small as a golf ball could smash a satellite to pieces. Some have even suggested we may be heading towards a ‘Kessler syndrome’-type event. This was envisaged in the 2013 movie Gravity, which portrayed a satellite collision that sparked a chain reaction where debris increasingly impacted other satellites, creating more debris in the process. This has led many companies and agencies to draw up plans to reduce the amount of space debris in Earth orbit, such as proposals to drag debris down with magnetic nets or lasers. The Swiss-based CleanSpaceOne, meanwhile, could grab larger pieces of debris or defunct satellites with a ‘claw’ at its front before dragging it back down to burn up in the atmosphere. Space junk (illustration shown) is a growing problem for travel into the cosmos. According to Nasa more than 500,000 pieces of debris are orbiting Earth at speeds of over 17,500 miles (28,000 kilometres) per hour. At this speed a piece as small as a golf ball could smash a satellite to pieces . Pictured is a hole caused by orbital debris that was found in Nasa's Solar Maximum Mission when it was serviced aboard Space Shuttle Challenger in 1984. The Earth-orbiting satellite launched on 14 February 1980 to observe the sun and re-entered the atmosphere in 1989 . Japan’s decision to dedicate part of its national defense to cleaning up Earth orbit will therefore be a welcome development for worried engineers. The move follows Japan’s decision in 2008 to allow military activities in space. The space force will be part of a partnership with the US, as the two seek to cooperate in space, referred to as the ‘fourth battlefield’ by a source in the Mainichi Shimbun. The unit will use radar and telescope facilities jointly with the science ministry and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa) to run its observatory operations. These will likely be the radar and telescope facilities in Okayama operated by Tokyo-based think-tank Japan Space Forum. And the space force may be composed of personnel from the Air Self-Defence Force, the country’s air force. If will also provide the US military with information gleaned from the operation. What the goals of the space force will be beyond monitoring space junk, however, is not yet known. Some have suggested we may be heading towards a ‘Kessler syndrome’-type event. This was envisaged in the 2013 movie Gravity (poster shown), which portrayed a satellite collision that sparked a chain reaction where debris increasingly impacted other satellites, creating more debris in the process.

"He was a dashing D-Day veteran and she a blushing bride in white when they vowed to love each other in sickness and in health. For 65 years Harry and Mavis Stevenson stayed true to that promise, and when she died just 48 hours after her 89th birthday, he could not bear to be without her. Yesterday their nephew Stephen Cresswell told how 88-year-old Mr Stevenson died within minutes of his beloved wife after they spent their last night holding hands while they slept in a care home. Inseparable: Harry Stevenson, 88, died in a care home moments after he was told of the death of his beloved 89-year-old wife, Mavis. Above, the couple, who met as teenagers, celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary . Young love: The couple, pictured on their wedding day, started their courtship shortly before Mr Stevenson signed up to fight in the Second World War. After years apart, the couple refused to be separated again . He said: ‘The staff told Harry very gently that she had passed away and said he shed two or three tears. Then they tended to Mavis and the next time they looked over at Harry, he was gone. ‘It was less than ten minutes later. He was lying next to her in a separate bed at the time. They shared a room in the home and the staff had pushed the beds together the night before. ‘They told me he was holding her hand all that final night.’ He added: ‘Although it is incredibly sad it is also incredibly wonderful that right until the very end they were together and neither of them had to be alone. Their love lasted and they were devoted to each other. I can imagine them being together now, after their death, side by side.’ The couple from Derby refused to be separated throughout their life. When Mrs Stevenson’s health deteriorated, her husband insisted on moving into the care home as well so he could be with her. Mr Cresswell, 53, said that Mr Stevenson was in better health than his wife and relatives were not expecting his death on November 3. Devoted: While abroad as a Royal Marine Commando, Mr Stevenson sent heartfelt love letters to his sweetheart (above). He continued to pen the notes even after his hand was shot in combat . The couple met at a social club aged 16 and began courting before Harry signed up to fight in the Second World War on his 17th birthday in 1943. He became a Royal Marine Commando and took part in the D-Day Normandy landings. Later he was transferred to the Far East to fight the Japanese. But wherever he was he wrote to his sweetheart – even after he was shot in the hand. In one letter he said: ‘I am glad to know that you are still in love with me. I know you are, Mavis, and you should know that I am very much in love with you.’ Other letters found by Mr Creswell show that Mr Stevenson sometimes wrote to her twice a day – in the morning and in the afternoon. Mr Cresswell believes the couple’s bond was so strong because they were separated during the war and did not want to ever be parted again. True love: Mr and Mrs Stevenson's lifelong romance echoed the plot of popular romantic film, The Notebook . They married in 1949 and Mr Stevenson found a job as a joiner. He carried on working even after his hand was amputated as a result of lasting damage from his war injuries. After retiring, he volunteered as a cricket groundsman and umpire and continued to run half-marathons well into his 60s. Although the couple never had any children, they lavished love on their extended family and were renowned for their Boxing Day lunches. Mr Cresswell said: ‘They wanted to be together. There was no way of separating them. They were as close as any couple I have known. They never had a serious argument and were soulmates.’ The couple’s joint funeral is due to take place on Thursday.","Harry and Mavis Stevenson met at a social club when they were 16 .

"The U.S. Department of Agriculture has approved Idaho-based J.R. Simplot Co.'s new genetically modified potato - thought business partner McDonald's has not. The fast-food giant said it doesn't use genetically modified potatoes, The Idaho Statesman reported on Saturday. 'McDonald's USA does not source GMO potatoes, nor do we have current plans to change our sourcing practices,' the company said in a statement. Ready to go: The USDA this month gave Boise-based Simplot permission to begin commercial planting of its new spud, called the 'Innate' potato . The USDA this month gave Boise-based Simplot permission to begin commercial planting of its new spud, called the 'Innate' potato, the newspaper reported. According to The Idaho Statesman, the company altered the potato's DNA so it produces less acrylamide, which is suspected to be a human carcinogen. Potatoes naturally produce the chemical when they're cooked at high temperatures. The potato is also engineered to resist bruising. Simplot is a major supplier of french fries, hash browns and other potato products for restaurant chains like McDonald's. A GMO from Monsanto stopped being produced when it suffered poor sales in a separate, earlier case after it failed to be accepted by both the fast-food industry and buyers, The Idaho Statesman reported. Doug Cole, a spokesman for Simplot, told the newspaper that Innate would be accepted by the fresh potato market. The newspaper reported that Cole also claimed consumers are going to respond to both lower possible carcinogens and sugars. Refusal: 'McDonald's USA does not source GMO potatoes, nor do we have current plans to change our sourcing practices,' the company said in a statement (file photo) The Idaho Statesman reported 'Because only 400 test acres of Innate varieties were planted and harvested this fall, production can't ramp up until after the 2015 harvest, [Cole] said.' Dehydrated potato industry buyers have said to potato grower Duane Grant that he shouldn't plant Innate potatoes, Grant told the newspaper. However, he told the newspaper he wants to find people to buy the Innate potatoes from him. He told the newspaper this is because he wants to plant Innate potatoes, which have less bruising - linking them to increased crop production. The Idaho Statesman reported 'Consumers will be more receptive to Simplot's potato than Monsanto's because it benefits them, not just growers, [Grant] said.' Grant told the newspaper that getting the food industry behind the Innate potato is the essential point for both Simplot and potato growers. 'Brand equity is extremely important to quick-serve restaurants,' he told The Idaho Statesman. 'They will avoid conflict whenever possible in order to protect equity of their brand name.'","The USDA this month gave Boise-based Simplot permission to begin commercial planting of its new spud, called the 'Innate' potato .

"Secretary of State John Kerry has declared he believes a potential £3billion plan is emerging that could boost the Palestinian economy by up to 50 per cent in the next three years. It could also cut unemployment by almost two-thirds, and average wages could jump 40 per cent, he said. But Kerry said it all depends on parallel progress on peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Kerry has been working with former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and global business leaders to devise economic plans to revitalise the Palestinian economy. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has said a potential £3billion plan is emerging that could expand the Palestinian economy . Kerry has been working with former British Prime Minister Tony Blair (pictured) and global business leaders to devise economic plans . He offered few specific details and acknowledged that his vision might easily be taken as fantasy in a part of the world that has suffered through decades of conflict, and where peace prospects remain dim. 'We know it can be done,' he insisted. 'This is a plan for the Palestinian economy that is bigger, bolder and more ambitious than anything proposed' in the last two decades. Kerry, outlining his hopes at a business conference on the Dead Sea in Jordan, was unsparing in his bold economic predictions: . - Palestinian agriculture production could double or triple . - Tourism could triple . - 100,000 new homes, many of them energy efficient, could be built in the next three years. Pictured here speaking at the World Economic Forum on the Middle East and North Africa at the King Hussein Convention Centre, near the Dead Sea, Kerry said tourism could triple in Palestine if the plan is a success . Kerry said 100,000 new homes could be built in the next three years in Palestine. Pictured here, a Palestinian youth throws a stone towards Israeli forces at the Qalandia checkpoint, in the Israeli occupied West Bank, Palestine . The former Massachusetts senator, who has been trying as well to restart direct Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, was to meet later Sunday in Amman with Blair, American hedge fund investor Tim Collins and the foreign ministers of Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. He said he has been coordinating with leading business experts around the world and that the plan would explore new opportunities in tourism, construction, light manufacturing, agriculture, energy and communications. 'Is this a fantasy?' Kerry asked the crowd. 'I don't think so, because there are already great examples of investment and entrepreneurship that are working in the West Bank. 'We know it can be done, but we've never experienced the kind of concentrated effort that this group is talking about bringing to the table.' He said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas support the plan, but he added that it won't truly take hold unless both sides make headway on restarting peace talks. Abbas also attended the conference in Jordan, as did Israeli President Shimon Peres, though they offered two starkly different messages on the peace impasse. The Palestinian leader spent much of the time criticizing Israeli intransigence, while the Israeli Nobel Peace Prize laureate pressed his government's view that negotiations should begin immediately without preconditions. Kerry allowed that barriers to commerce would have to be removed to spur economic growth. The Palestinians have long complained about limitations on movement and investment that have hampered its economic potential. Kerry has made four trips to Israel and the Palestinian territories over the last two months in an effort to rejuvenate the peace process. He hasn't made any tangible success so far but insists he is engaged in productive talks with both sides.","Kerry says plan could cut unemployment by almost two-thirds .

"Hospital consultants who refuse to publish their patient death rates will be sacked under a transparency drive, the NHS said yesterday. Cancer units will also have to publish statistics showing how many patients survive their treatment, allowing people to compare services. The warning comes a few days before a third of the country’s consultants are expected to refuse to publish their performance statistics. Hospital staff who don't publish their patient death rates could face losing their jobs under transparency drive . This week, for the second year running, the NHS will publish the death rates of England’s surgeons. Some 5,000 surgeons are thought to have agreed to the process - but another 2,500 have refused. Sir Bruce Keogh, medical director of NHS England, warned that from next year consultants who do not allow their data to be published will not pass their five-yearly revalidation or be awarded financial bonuses. Last year’s exercise showed that 16 surgeons saw patients die in 10 per cent of operations. One doctor, a vascular surgeon, recorded a death rate of 31 per cent - ten times the national average and 30 times higher than some of his colleagues. Patients have the right to refuse to be operated on by a particular surgeon if they are concerned about their performance. Sir Bruce Keogh, medical director of NHS England, said providing the information is vital to improve the safety of treatment . Sir Bruce, who is himself a heart surgeon, said such information is vital to improve the safety of treatment. He acknowledged that publishing the consultant death rates was unpopular with many, but added: ‘This is not going to go away. ‘We are looking now at a series of inducements, penalties to force that,’ he told the Sunday Times. ‘On the personal level is the revalidation, there are also clinical excellence awards [financial bonus]. ‘If you want to progress with your clinical excellence award, if you have refused to allow your data to be published, then that will affect your progression.’ Some surgeons have publicly criticised the NHS transparency drive as ‘meaningless’. Professor Peter McCollum, a leading vascular surgeon at Hull Royal Infirmary, last year refused to publish his own death rates. He said it was a flawed exercise and that death rates do not tell the whole story. When a surgeon only carries out a small number of operations, a couple of deaths could occur by chance but they would skew overall outcome, he said. ‘It puts a huge amount of pressure on younger consultants not to do difficult cases which is absurd because many of those cases need to be done,’ Professor McCollum said last year. ‘The data is fairly meaningless. There are other ways of picking up bad surgeons. The problem is that if you want information this data must be interpreted by an expert and that is not what has happened on this occasion. ‘We would prefer our results to be analysed at unit level, with a much larger number of cases albeit spread over a number of surgeons.’ But Sir Bruce said that the effect would stop surgeons doing operations for which others have better expertise. ‘We will lose some surgeons,’ he said. ‘We will, and have as a consequence of this endeavour. Professor Peter McCollum, left, who last year refused to publish his death rates and, right, health secretary Jeremy Hunt said that transparency over cancer treatment will help NHS improve its care . ‘The other thing that is more likely, and will help with quality, is that those surgeons who are doing just a small number of operations will think, “I’m not doing that any more”, and they will pass on those operations to their colleagues.’ The NHS will also order hospitals to publish cancer survival rates from next year. Every hospital will be obliged to publish its one- and five-year survival rates for breast, bowel, lung and prostate cancer. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, said: ‘Cancer remains our biggest killer, which is why we want to be the best country in Europe for cancer outcomes. More transparency in this area will help the NHS improve cancer care and learn from the best.’","This week the NHS will publish the death rates of England's surgeons .

"Nicolas Sarkozy has placed the scrapping of France’s gay marriage laws at the centre of his bid to be re-elected as the country’s President. In hugely controversial comments made on Saturday, the 59-year-old politician confirmed he would ‘repeal’ Socialist legislation allowing same-sex unions. This is despite Mr Sarkozy’s third wife, the former model and pop singer Carla Bruni, being a huge supporter of homosexuals marrying and adopting children. Nicolas Sarkozy speaking at the the 'Sens Commun' meeting in Paris on Saturday said that he would scrap France's gay marriage laws as part of his bid to be re-elected as the country's President . Mr Sarkozy was pressed on the issue during a debate in Paris between the three candidates hoping to lead the conservative UMP party into the 2017 presidential election. He said the May 2013 law which legalised gay adoption ‘should be written from the ground up’. The predominantly right-wing audience chanted ‘Repeal! Repeal!’, and Mr Sarkozy said: ‘If you prefer that I say repeal the law, it comes down to the same thing.’ Mr Sarkozy did nothing for homosexuals who wanted to marry during his single term as President between 2007 and 2012. The vast majority of French people are at least nominally Catholic, and there has been huge opposition to President Francois Hollande’s liberal social policies. However, an Ifop poll published on Saturday showed 68 per cent of the French were in favour of same-sex unions. The 59-year-old former president confirmed he would ‘repeal’ Socialist legislation allowing same-sex unions . It also showed that 53 per cent of the country supported adoption by homosexual couples. Pressed about such contentious issues last year, Ms Bruni said: ‘I’m rather in favor because I have a lot of friends - men and women - who are in this situation and I see nothing unstable or perverse in families with gay parents.” Ms Bruni added: ‘My husband is opposed for reasons linked to his political vocation, because he sees people as groups of thousands rather than people we know personally.’ Despite facing a long list of corruption enquiries, Mr Sarkozy is convinced he can become head of state again in three years. He has increasingly placed himself to the right of the political agenda, mainly in response to the increasing success of the far-right National Front. He made the claims despite his third wife, Carla Bruni (pictured together), being a strong supporter of gay marriage and homosexual couples adopting children .","Nicolas Sarkozy, 59, said he would 'repeal' laws allowing same-sex unions .

"Security camera footage of an alleged plot to cover up Rebekah Brooks’s involvement in phone hacking was shown to her trial yesterday. The video shows her racehorse trainer husband Charlie and her security staff hiding evidence while she was being questioned by police, it was alleged. On the day of former News International chief executive Brooks’s arrest, her 50-year-old husband and News International head of security Mark Hanna allegedly co-ordinated an elaborate operation, codenamed Blackhawk, to remove computer evidence from her Oxfordshire and London homes – hours before police searched them. Scroll down for video . Evidence: CCTV images allegedly showing Charlie Brooks hiding evidence while wife Rebekah was being questioned by police were shown to the jury in the hacking trial in January . Mystery: Charlie Brooks was seen taking a jiffy bag and laptop into the underground car park. He is then seen to disappear behind a column and comes back into view empty-handed less than a minute later . While Brooks, 45, was being . interviewed by detectives, CCTV footage shows her husband walking . through the car park below their flat in  Chelsea Harbour holding a . jiffy bag and laptop. He disappears from view and reappears moments . later holding only his mobile phone at 12.15pm on July 17, 2011. The . prosecution at the Old Bailey claim he stashed the padded envelope and . laptop behind bins so police would not find them. Two hours later, the . footage shows Hanna arriving in the car park where he met Charlie . Brooks. Hanna, 50, then appears to retrieve the envelope, laptop and a brown briefcase and walks away. Later that afternoon police arrived and searched the flat. Footage shows them leaving with computers and bags full of documents. That evening Daryl Jorsling, another News International security guard, arrived in the car park.

"It has long been an integral part of school chemistry lessons - and a revision nightmare for students the world over. Now there is one more element to add to the periodic table - and a 'super-heavy' one at that. Scientists in Sweden have confirmed the existence of a new chemical element, but its name may need some work. The 'super-heavy' man-made element has been temporarily named 'ununpentium' and refers to the element's 115th place in the periodic table. Scientists in Sweden have confirmed the existence of a new chemical element. The 'super-heavy' man-made element has been temporarily named 'ununpentium' and refers to its 115th place in the periodic table . Ununpentium will likely get a new name if the discovery is formally . approved by experts from the International Union of Pure and Applied . Physics and Chemistry. It presently has an . atomic symbol of Uup and is approximately 289 times heavier than hydrogen, which is the . lightest element. Researchers at Lund University in Sweden lead the research and said their find backs up claims by teams in Russia and the United States a decade ago that had remained unverified until now. The Swedish scientists say they conducted experiments which allowed them to detect the `fingerprint' of the short-lived but heavy element. The experiment was conducted at the GSI research facility in Germany. 'This was a very successful experiment and is one of the most important in the field in recent years', said Dirk Rudolph, Professor at the Division of Nuclear Physics at Lund University. Ununpentium will likely get a new name if the discovery is formally approved by experts from the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics and Chemistry. It presently has an atomic symbol of Uup and is approximately 289 times heavier than hydrogen - the lightest element . Besides the observations of the new chemical element, the researchers have also gained access to data that gives them a deeper insight into the structure and properties of super-heavy atomic nuclei. By bombarding a thin film of americium with calcium ions, the research team was able to measure photons in connection with the new element’s alpha decay. Certain energies of the photons agreed with the expected energies for X-ray radiation, which is a ‘fingerprint’ of a given element. Some people have claimed ununpentium is used by UFOs as a component in gravity wave generators, The Telegraph reported. The new element also makes an appearance in computer games including Tomb Raider and Call of Duty, where it is an energy source for weapons and teleporters. However, due to its unstable nature, its uses in the real world are likely to be few and far between. Livermorium, which has the atomic number of 116, is the most recent element to be approved and win a spot on the periodic table in May 2012.","'Ununpentium' is a heavy man-made element and is currently 115th in the periodic table .

"A newly developed body armour, complete with built-in sensors that can measure the damage a hit would cause to the unprotected body, is set to revolutionise the sport of mixed martial arts. The high-tech armour, has been designed by Unified Weapons Master, not only to protect but also to register the real force behind each strike. A team of engineers from Chiron Global spent four years developing the Iron Man-like armour, which is designed to be flexible enough to fight in and uses built-in sensors to calculate and display the damage a weapon hit would have done to an unprotected body. Scroll down for video . Armed combat: Fighters wear 'intelligent' armour that shields them and calculates the damage a strike would cause to a body that was unprotected . The research team based in Sydney, Australia, includes a former armor developer, who worked on the Lord Of The Rings and Hobbit films. Unified Weapons Master, is set to run competitions later this year with bouts featuring world-class martial artists engaging in combat with weapons. 'UWM’s vision is to create a large-scale sport and entertainment experience where martial artists can compete against each other with real weapons, with an objective measure of who would have won in a real combat situation,' UWM CEO David Pysden says. 'This is something that has not been possible since the days of the Gladiator,' said David Pysden, UWM CEO and experienced martial artist. 'We believe this new sport has the potential to generate similar levels of interest as mixed martial arts by unifying the weapons-based martial arts community.' Fighting it out: Opponents engage in combat wearing armour that has been designed to withstand high-impact strikes from martial arts weapons . 'UWM will take a wide variety of ancient arts from around the world and bring them together for the first time ever, using modern technology,' Pysden said. UWM Chairman, Justin Forsell says he was inspired to develop UWM because he wanted to re-ignite interest in hidden weapons arts, many of which he says are at risk of being lost forever. 'UWM is the creation of a new global combat sport that combines thousands of years of history with cutting-edge technology to create a unique martial arts experience,' Forsell says. 'The arts that UWM will showcase have been passed down from Master to student for generations and are closely linked to the national cultures, histories and identities of these countries.' 'Our vision is to bring these ancient weapons arts to the global stage.' Suit up: The UWM armour features technology that objectively measures the specific location and force of strikes to a competitor¿s suit of armour . So far, the armour has been tested by a number of well-known martial arts experts including World Muay Thai Champion known as 'The Arch Angel' Sone Vannathy. Vannathy says the armour allows competitors to hit their opponent without cauing major injuries. 'Going up against a competitor wearing the armour, I can strike them to the best of my ability without fear of causing serious injury,' he says. 'The experience is unlike any other, but it still feels good to hit.' A spokeswoman for Unified Weapons Master says the armour and software are fully working prototypes and the company is currently  working to raise additional capital to produce production versions of the suits. She says the armour isn't for sale yet, however the company intends to produce a  training version for purchase. A release date for the product has not been set. 'The first production versions will be used for our UWM competitions, where we intend to have the best weapons based fighters from around the world compete to determine the first Unified Weapons Master,' she says. Head protection: High-tech helmet worn during battle to protect competitor and register damage caused by hits until a fighter is virtually knocked out or killed . The UWM armour features technology that objectively measures the specific location and force of strikes to a competitor’s suit of armour. Using medical research, including fracture profiling, software calculates and represents the actual damage that would have occurred to an unprotected competitor. It then processes a result, similar to a video game, but based on real, full-contact martial arts weapons combat, all in real-time. The armour has been designed to withstand high-impact strikes from real,but blunt, martial arts weapons. Damage caused by hits accumulates until a competitor is virtually ‘knocked out’ or ‘killed’, with a strike or a series of strikes of sufficient force to render an unprotected competitor incapacitated. Competitors can have multiple ‘lives’, just like in a video game, in order to prolong the duration of the bouts. The winner can also be determined based on a points system using impact data from the fight.

"The bitter row over allowing unqualified teachers today after it emerged the number of untrained staff in classrooms was higher under Labour. Education Secretary Michael Gove is allowing academy schools to employ people with no formal teacher training but his Labour opponent Stephen Twigg has warned it risks damaging the quality of lessons. But new figures released in parliament show there were more unqualified teachers in England and Wales when Mr Twigg was schools minister under Tony Blair. Freedoms: The coalition has allowed academies to hire unqualified teachers in line with private schools (file picture) The two parties have been locked in an increasingly angry dispute over whether good teachers need to pass exams before being allowed into schools. Last year Mr Gove announced academies could employ staff without formal teaching qualifications, in line with freedoms enjoyed by free schools and the independent sector. The Department for Education said the flexibility would more schools to hire ‘great linguists, computer scientists, engineers and other specialists who have not worked in state schools before’. Labour opposes the plan, even though Mr Twigg and his colleague Tristram Hunt have boasted of ‘teaching’ in schools in their constituencies. However, official figures show that the number of unqualified teachers in schools in England has fallen dramatically since the coalition was formed. Embarrassingly, the data was requested by Labour frontbencher Kevin Brennan. Data: Despite the pledge, the number of unqualified teachers in England has fallen from more than 18,000 in 2005 to just over 14,000 in 2012 . In 2005 there were 18,800 unqualified teachers in publicly-funded schools, accounting for 4.5 per cent of all teaching staff. Mr Twigg was schools minister in Mr Blair’s government until he lost his seat at the May 2005 general election. By 2010 there were 17,800 unqualified teachers, falling in 2012 to 14,800. Mr Gove now believes 'Labour's . education policy is a joke’ after attacking free schools but backing . parent and teacher led academies and regularly teaching in schools. A source close to the Education . Secretary added: ‘Now it is revealed that when Labour was in Government . and Stephen Twigg was education minister there were thousands more . teachers without the certificate than there are now. ‘Every policy announcement from . Stephen Twigg blows up in his face. It is madness to want to fire great . teachers just because they don't have a union approved certificate or to . stop brilliant teachers from private schools switching to state . schools.' Clash: A source close to Education Secretary Michael Gove (left) said Labour's policy 'is a joke' but Stephen Twigg warned unqualified teachers are damaging school standards . However, Labour said the total number of teachers rose under Labour from almost 400,000 in 1997 to 448,000 in 2010, and has fallen by 6,000 since then. Unqualified teachers were not allowed to be employed permanently in state-funded schools under Labour. Mr Twigg said: ‘‘When Labour was in government, all teachers in state funded school had to become qualified. Michael Gove scrapped this rule. ‘Michael Gove is damaging school standards by allowing unqualified teachers to teach on a permanent basis in academies and Free Schools. ‘This means that there are now more than 5,300 unqualified teachers- an increase of more than 3,000 since November 2010- in academies and Free Schools. At the next General Election, Labour will offer a guarantee that all teachers in all state funded schools will in future have to have or work towards qualified status’.","Labour opposes coalition allowing academies to hire unqualified staff .

"He's something of a celebrity in Philadelphia's iconic LOVE Park - the Pennsylvanian capital's answer to Times Square's Naked Cowboy, or so they say. But the city's much-loved 'Philly Jesus' - a daily fixture famous for his attempts to walk on water in the park's fountains and even baptize people - was arrested on Friday for disorderly conduct and failure to disperse, sparking outrage among his many admirers. The man behind the Holy robe is Michael Grant, a recovering drug addict and panhandler who has been clean for one year, crediting his sobriety to finding Jesus Christ. However Grant claims the cop that arrested him recognized Grant from his 'drug days' and the long list of charges associated with them, including loitering, possession of marijuana, and theft of services, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer. Arrested: Michael Grant, better known as 'Philly Jesus', is said to have recited scripture as he was taken into custody Friday in Philadelphia's LOVE Park . Local attraction: Philly Jesus did a few laps of the Dilworth Plaza skating rink prior to his arrest .

His arrest came after he went for a skate around the Dilworth Plaza skating rink. Grant then returned to his usual spot by the fountain and took some pictures with passers-by . He was approached by police and accused of solicitation, Grant later claimed on Twitter, saying he accepts tips but does not ask for money, according to NBC Philadelphia. The cop told Grant to leave the park, but he refused. Philly Jesus was then arrested. He has been charged with disorderly conduct and failure to disperse. 'Cured': Michael Grant said he only considered himself healed from drug addiction after 'surrendering to Jesus Christ' Holy man: Philly Jesus says he accepts tips from people but not ask for money as part of his shtick . Set him free: Hundreds of people have support a hashtag set up for Grant called #FreePhillyJesus . Grant is said to have recited scripture as he was taken to the police station. 'Those are charges that, in my experience, the government uses when you don't do whatever the government wants you to do, or that the police officer wants you to do,' Grant's lawyer, Charles M. Gibbs, told The Inquirer. 'He's a very decent young man who is simply exercising his First Amendment right of speech,' Gibbs added. Fans fans quickly took to Twitter and Instagram following Grant's arrest, setting up a 'Free Philly Jesus' hashtag. On Friday night Grant Tweeted: 'Free dudes.' He has since retweeted hundreds of messages of support from people on social media. Gibbs said they are looking forward to Grant's day in court.

"As you toil away at the washing, ironing and school run, it can be easy to feel undervalued. So it may come as some solace to know the value of such household work is soon to be given its full recognition by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Their experts have been busy calculating how much various tasks would cost if you had to pay someone else to do them as they prepare to issue a figure for Britain’s ‘unpaid gross domestic product’ next year. Experts from the Office for National Statistics have been busy calculating how much various tasks would cost if you had to pay someone else to do them - washing and drying accounted for £86.3 billion . So far, for example, they have calculated that laundry services, including producing, repairing, washing, drying and pressing clothes, were worth £97.2 billion in the whole of the UK in 2012. Of that, washing and drying accounted for £86.3 billion, with ironing contributing considerably less – as the study found that despite the average household doing 260 laundry loads per year, Britons only iron 10 per cent of all clothing. Informal childcare, meaning all care by parents and other relatives which does not involve a monetary transaction and including time when an adult may not be directly interacting with the child but is still responsible for them, was said to be worth £343 billion in 2010 - about three times the contribution of the financial services industry. The figures found household transport, including the school run, was worth £269 billion in 2010 . Household transport, including the school run, was worth £269 billion in 2010. The calculations were based on various rates per mile, for instance trips in London of two miles or less were worked out using minicab rates of £5.29 a mile while the price for a similar journey in the rest of Britain was £3.44 dropping to £1.44 a mile after more than two miles. Informal adult care, ranging from giving specialised care to an elderly relative such as changing dressings on a wound to ‘keeping an eye’ on someone or doing their shopping, was worth £61.7 billion in 2010. The more than 2 billion hours of voluntary work put in by selfless individuals in 2012 raising money, leading groups, campaigning, or befriending and mentoring people, was valued at £23.9 billion. Valerie Fender, head of economic well-being at the ONS believes the unpaid economy is worth about the same as the GDP, which is the principal means of determining the health of the UK economy. The figures so far were released in a series of ONS reports called the nation’s ‘Household Satellite Accounts’ (HHSA) over recent months. The HHSA measures and values all the unpaid production of goods and services such as cooking, cleaning and provision of childcare by households in the UK. The reports state: ‘The HHSA extends the National Accounts boundary to include all activity produced by households that could be delegated to another person. ‘The HHSA provides a means by which the influence of changing patterns of unpaid work on the economy can be measured. 'The information may also be of use to policy makers who may need to take significant amounts of unpaid work into account when making policy decisions.’ Today an ONS spokesman said: ‘Over the last few months we’ve been releasing different reports looking at various different parts of household production, or things you have to do for everyday life, and if you were to pay for them what the contribution to GDP would be. 'A report bringing them all together will be put out in the coming weeks.’","Office for National Statistics calculated how much household tasks would cost if you had to pay someone else to do them .

"A grandmother-of-ten who stunned her family by marrying a Tunisian toy-boy she met online is begging the Home Office to grant him a visa and has vowed to convert to Islam for him. Jane Makhloufi, 47, from Leeds, was swept off her feet by 32-year-old Mohamed after meeting him online when her first marriage collapsed. Despite warnings it was a scam, the mother-of-seven flew to Tunisia and tied the knot following a whirlwind romance. Now, to further prove her devotion, Mrs Makhloufi wants to become a Muslim, like her new husband, and start wearing a hijab. Jane Makhloufi, 47, from Leeds, was swept off her feet by 32-year-old Mohamed, from Tunisia, after meeting him online when her first marriage collapsed. The pair married in his native country a year after they first met . Mrs Makhloufi, a mother of seven, said she now wants to become a Muslim, like her new husband, and start wearing a hijab. She said the pair are devoted to each other despite warnings that the marriage is a scam . But Mohamed, 32, has so far been refused a UK Visa and relies on handouts from his wife while he searches for work. Mrs Makhloufi, who earns gets £70-a-week in incapacity benefits, has pleaded his case with the Home Office without success. She has asked the Prime Minister David Cameron, Nick Clegg and even The Queen for their support. She said: 'Plenty of people think it is a scam but I know it's not. He has told me many times that he doesn't want to be with any other woman. He only wants to be with me. 'People think all Tunisian men are love-rats but they need to get their facts right. There are love-rats all over the world, even in England. 'All the men I met in Tunisia with my husband were really nice. If I thought for one minute it was a scam, I wouldn't have married him. I would have just stayed on my own. 'We've been married two years now. If it was a scam he would have left me by now. Mrs Makhloufi, who earns gets £70-a-week in incapacity benefits, has pleaded her Tunisian husband's Visa case with the Home Office without success. She said the pair are now desperate to live together in Britain . Mrs Makhloufi said she was instantly attracted to Mohamed because he  wasn't 'sleazy' or 'after one thing' 'When he comes here I want to convert to Islam and wear a hijab. He hasn't said anything about it. It is my decision. If I want to do it I will do it.' Mrs Makhloufi met Mohamed, a former coffee shop worker, on a social networking site soon after ending her 'unhappy' marriage of 26 years in 2011. She said she was instantly attracted to him but was even more impressed by the fact he wasn't 'sleazy' or 'only after one thing'. After exchanging increasingly flirtatious messages, she took the plunge and flew to the coastal city of Sousse to meet him face-to-face. The keen knitter said she was nervous at first but was instantly won over by not only his looks but how polite and chivalrous he was. She said he held doors open in front of her and took her out for exotic meals on the beach. 'He was so different to the men back in England,' she said. 'When I met him he was a proper gentleman. He was clean and respectable. In the end we couldn't keep our hands off each other.' After 10-15 more trips to Tunisia, she was delighted when Mohamed finally popped the question and she didn't hesitate to accept. But not everyone was happy with their romance. 'Some of the people in Tunisia didn't like it,' said Mrs Makhloufi, who admits she had only been looking for fun to start with. Mrs Makhloufi has written to Prime Minister David Cameron, Nick Clegg and The Queen pleading for her husband to be granted a UK Visa. Pictured: The response from representatives of the Deputy Prime Minister . The grandmother-of-ten said the stress of missing her partner, who currently lives in Dublin, is making her ill . 'They would say: ""Why are you with an English woman, a bigger woman?"" 'And he would just reply: ""Because I want to be with an English woman, not a Tunisian woman.""' The pair were married on October 18, 2012, and Mrs Makhloufi describes it as the happiest day of her life. The ceremony was vibrant and lavish and the bride wore a traditional North African wedding dress and intricate henna tattoos on her arms while the groom was dressed in a dark suit. But their joy was short lived when, instead of coming home to live in her second floor Leeds council flat, Mohamed was refused a Visa because his English was poor. And, even when it vastly improved with his new wife's help, he was again turned away because the UK Border Agency believed she could not support him if he failed to get a job. As an immigrant he would have to be a resident for two-and-a-half years before he could claim benefits. Instead, Mohammed travelled to Dublin, Ireland, after getting an EU Visa in 'three weeks' and has been there the last four months looking for work. To survive he cooks and cleans for friends in return for a bed and food. The pair married in October 2012 (pictured) in Tunisia following a whirlwind romance . His devoted wife sends him money when she can and even encourages him to pass it on to his family in Tunisia, who she says were always very welcoming. Mrs Makhloufi, who suffers from rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis which keeps her out of work, said the stress of the situation is starting to make her illness worse. She flies to see him in Ireland as many times as she can and when they are apart they speak every night on the phone or over a live video link. They talk so much that some of her grandchildren, who regularly visit, now jokingly refer to him as their 'second grandad.' Not all of her family, many of whom are almost the same age as her husband, are happy with the union while others are content to just 'see her happy'. Mohamed, who was previously worked as a builder in Tunisia, said he hopes to come to the UK and prove his doubters wrong. But most of all he wants to make up for his wife's generosity towards him. He said: 'She is a good woman with a tender, soft heart. Every time I have been in need she has always been there. 'She has treated me well, with a lot of respect and always understands me. I've found in her what I never found in others. I hope to build a real life together. 'I've really suffered being away from her. I've been so stressed day after day and I feel hopeless and lost. 'I know some people think it is fake but I'm not bothered what they say. At the end of the day all that matter is that I am with her and she is with me and the others cannot bother us.' Meanwhile, Mrs Makhloufi said she will continue to fight for her husband's 'right' to come to the UK and live with her. And, although she sees little hope at present, she is adamant she will not give up without a fight. 'No one should have to leave their husband behind,' she said. 'All I want is for us to have a life together. All I want is for my husband to be here with me.'","Mother Jane Makhloufi, from Leeds, met Tunisian Mohamed online in 2011 .

It comes after a woman in Mosman, north of Sydney, called police when she spotted a drone flying outside her top-floor apartment in July. She was told it was a real estate agent's drone who was 'scoping for properties' and it wasn't illegal because the agent had the required paper work. 'I got a shock. At first i thought it was a plane in the distance. I could see flashing lights and realised it was a drone. What are they looking at? What are they scoping for. It's crazy,' the woman, who didn't want to be named, told the Mosman Daily. The practice of real estate agents flying drones to take advertising photos of properties is legal as long as the operator has approval. Rules for flying drones is covered under Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) legislation and commercial operators must meet certain licensing requirements in order to use them.

"The first pictures of a stomach-turning torture chamber where a British-born Massachusetts resident planned to rape, murder and eat children have emerged. Prosecutors are pushing for would-be cannibal Geoffrey Portway, 40, to be put away for 27 years after he confessed to plotting the heinous crimes. He will be sentenced next Tuesday. Photographs taken by investigators of Portway's Worchester home in 2012 show an eerie staircase leading to a hidden basement room containing a 'child-sized homemade coffin,' a steel cage, handcuffs and a set of butcher's knives. Scroll down for video . Creepy: Pictures of the stomach-turning torture chamber where British-born Massachusetts resident Geoffrey Portway planned to rape, murder then eat children show a makeshift coffin and a cage, left . Coffin: The homemade child-size box, pictured, was soundproofed . Evidence: Investigators also found handcuffs, pictured, in the horror basement torture chamber . 'Portway has pled guilty to some of . the most vile and heinous crimes known to our society, namely . participating in the sexual exploitation of young children through the . possession and distribution of child pornography and soliciting the . kidnapping of a child for the purpose of killing and consuming that . child,' federal prosecutors wrote in court documents, obtained by the Boston Herald. Guilty: Portway, 40, was sentenced to 27 years on Tuesday in Worcester, Massachusetts . The . sentencing papers, filed yesterday, include frightening excerpts from . online chats Portway had with like-minded child pornographers and . potential killers, including Florida puppeteer Ronald Brown who planned . to kidnap children he knew through his local church. According . to the Herald, Brown went as far as to send Portway a photograph of a . young boy 'with lines drawn on him to identify the different cuts of . meat.' The two chatted . about kidnapping the boy, taking him to a rented house and eating him . over several weeks before feeding the 'leftovers' to alligators. Brown . has since been convicted. In . May, Portway pleaded guilty to solicitation to kidnap a child and to . distribution and possession of child pornography. As a British national, . he will likely be deported after serving his sentence. Portway had numerous chats with . individuals about a 'mutual interest in abducting, raping, murdering, . and eating children,' an agreed statement of facts released by the U.S. attorney in Boston in May stated. In . July last year, federal agents searching Portway's residence in . Worcester discovered the terrifying locked dungeon in the basement of . his home. It contained a chair, television, and what appeared to be cable access to the Internet. The . room also contained the child-sized homemade coffin that had large . speakers covering wire mesh at one end and an exterior locking devices. Strange: Police found various other items including a child's jumpsuit, pictured, in the basement . Locks: The box had straps, pictured, which Portway intended to use to restrain his victim . They also found a steel cage . approximately 3' wide, 2'high and 4' long with multiple locking devices, . and a steel table top with steel rings at six points, presumably for . restraints. Outside was a cabinet freezer, an upright freezer, disposable scalpels, butchering kits, and castration tools. This . dungeon was described in detail by Portway in recovered chats as a . place he intended to use to keep kidnapped children while he sexually . abused them and as a place to eventually murder and cannibalize the . children. Many of these conversations were accompanied by the trading of child pornography. These . chats also included images of children known to them, accompanied by . discussions of desire to sexually abuse, murder and cannibalize those . children. Stairs: Photographs taken by investigators of Portway's Worchester home in 2012 show an eerie staircase, pictured, leading down to a hidden basement dungeon . Knives: Police also found a 'delux butcher set,' pictured, in Portway's home . Disturbing: Books and DVDs on cannibalism, pictured, were discovered in Portway's home . Bleach: Investigators also found a bottle of bleach in the dungeon . As stated both in court filings from . May, through his online chats, Portway solicited several people for . their help in abducting a child, including Brown and another man called Michael Arnett of Kansas. At . least as early as 2010, Portway utilized Skype and other programs to . communicate with Arnett, trading child pornography including images of . injured, mutilated and deceased children while chatting about the sexual . abuse, rape, abduction, murder, and cannibalism of children. Over . months, Portway repeatedly solicited Arnett to kidnap a child for him, . with the intent that Portway would ultimately rape, kill and eat that . child. These solicitations . for help in abducting a child included discussing real children, by name . and photo, that Arnett claimed to know and have access. Rope: Other equipment found included 'Japanese Silk Love Rope' Cage: The cage had a small mattress in it and multiple locks . Sick: Portway's DVD collection contained much inspiration for the gruesome things he planned to carry out . In the chats, . Portway and Arnett discuss different ways to kidnap children and the age . range that Portway prefers. During the time that Portway was soliciting Arnett, Portway had been told that Arnett had helped others with such requests before and that . Arnett had experience with the abduction and sexual abuse of children. Arnett has since pleaded guilty in Kansas to the sexual exploitation of a child for the purposes of producing child pornography. A forensic examination of the computers uncovered evidence of over 4,500 trades of child pornography between Portway and others. Many of these trades involved Portway distributing child pornography to others based on their stated specific preferences, including images and videos appearing to depict dead children and the cannibalism of children. House of horror: Tucked in the basement of a Beechmont Street, Worcester, MA home federal authorities found a dungeon containing a child-sized homemade coffin, a steel cage, torture devices and butchering tools . Agreement: Geoffrey Portway, a UK citizen born in Spain and living in Worcester, Massachusetts had solicited a Kansas man, Michael Arnett (pictured), to kidnap a child whom Portway 'would ultimately rape, kill and eat.' Filthy: The apartment including the sink, pictured,was filthy when police raided it . Sturdy: The lid of the cage is extremely sturdy with multiple locks . 'Clearly, the facts of this case were . quite disturbing and we are grateful law enforcement acted when they . did,' said United States Attorney Carmen Ortiz. 'I hope that this case send a clear . message that we will prosecute to the fullest extent of the law those . who participate in these types of activities. 'Even though criminals attempt to hide in the anonymity provided by the Internet, the Department of Justice is committed to aggressively pursuing them to ensure that there is no place to hide.' 'An investigation that began in Milford in 2010 — expanded to Europe and beyond —has returned back to where it originally started: the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,' said Bruce Foucart, special agent in charge of the Homeland Security Investigation in Boston. Locked: The door to the basement, pictured, had a sturdy lock . Meat: Bags of meat, pictured, were found in the man's freezer though none of it was human . Freezer: Portway talked of chopping up little boys, freezing the parts in his freezer, pictured, and eating them over several weeks . 'Since we began this operation —Operation Holitna — a worldwide network of offenders has been, and continues to be,unraveled, including Portway.' Foucart added,'Thanks to the determination of HSI, along with our partners at the U.S. attorney's office, we have been able to rescue 160 children and arrest 51 perpetrators worldwide. This was all  as a result of the arrest of a Milford man, and subsequent advanced forensics of his digital media. 'Portway's guilty plea should serve as a stern warning to those inclined to abuse children or share images of child pornography: there isn't a place in the United States, on the Internet, or the planet in which you are truly safe. We will investigate you, we will prosecute you and we will bring you to justice.' Sinister: The dungeon, pictured, was discovered after police noticed Portway chatting online about the planned crimes and sharing child porn .

"King Oswald, the seventh-century ruler of Northumbria, is hardly a household name. But as the man who helped unite Britain and convert the English to Christianity, he deserves to be much better remembered, according to one archaeologist. Oswald was exiled as a young man before returning to his homeland in order to claim his birthright and become king - an adventure which apparently inspired J.R.R. Tolkien to create the character of Aragorn in Lord of the Rings. Hero: The character of Aragorn in Lord of the Rings was inspired by Oswald, the seventh-century king of Northumbria, according to archaeologist Max Adams . Legacy: Oswald was instrumental in the foundation of Lindisfarne monastery, whose remains still stand . Artist's impression: This mid-19th-century painting by Ford Madox Brown shows Oswald, left, receiving homage from Aidan, the Bishop of Lindisfarne; no image of the king survives from his lifetime . Max Adams, a visiting fellow at Newcastle University, has written a biography of Oswald which argues that the king - later venerated across Europe as a saint and martyr - was a key figure in rebuilding the English state after the collapse of the Roman Empire. The book, entitled King in the North, describes how Oswald Iding was born into the royal house of Bernicia, a kingdom covering the territory which is now Northumberland, County Durham and south-east Scotland. His father Æthelfrith united Bernicia with Deira, a territory roughly corresponding to modern Yorkshire, to create the land of Northumbria - but in 616, when Oswald was just 12 years old, Æthelfrith was killed in battle, and his son was forced to flee England and take refuge in western Scotland. The new king of the Northumbrians, Edwin, was a distant cousin of Oswald, but that would not have saved the young prince from the wrath of a ruler keen to eliminate potential rivals. Treasure: The great Lindisfarne Gospels, now in the British Library, would not exist if Oswald had not kept his vow to St Columba to found a new religious institution . Stunning: The opening of St Matthew's Gospel from the Lindisfarne manuscript, written at the Northumbrian monastery less than a century after the death of Oswald . Home: Oswald was from the fortress of Bamburgh, whose later replacement is pictured here . Family tree: Oswald was the product of a marriage between the royal lines of Bernicia and Deira . For nearly two decades, Oswald grew up in the kingdom of Dal Riata, an Irish-speaking region covering the west coast of Scotland and part of Ulster. Crucially for Britain's future, it was here - at the monastery of Iona, in the Hebrides - that Oswald was converted to Christianity, having previously followed the pagan faith of his Germanic ancestors. It was also in Dal Riata that the young man forged a reputation as a warrior, fighting alongside his Celtic hosts and earning the nickname 'Whiteblade', according to Mr Adams. When his uncle Edwin was killed by a Welsh king in 633, Oswald decided it was time to reclaim the kingdom which he was born to rule, and he marched south with an army the next year. Before meeting the enemy in battle, the prince erected a cross at a site called Heavenfield, near Hexham in Northumberland, and prayed to St Columba - promising to found a monastery if his prayer was answered. Fame: A decorated box made in Germany in the 12th century to hold some of the remains of King Oswald, who was venerated across Europe as a saint and martyr . Inspiration: Aragorn, left, was apparently based on Oswald by Lord of the Rings author J.R.R. Tolkien, right . Power: This entry from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle claims that Oswald held hegemony over the other kingdoms in England during his reign . King Oswald of Northumbria was a . crucial figure in early English politics, but author Max Adams believes . that he is also linked to the Anglo-Saxons' greatest cultural . achievement - Beowulf. The epic poem is set in a great feasting hall, Heorot, which Mr Adams compares directly to the halls where Oswald held court. It . is not known when Beowulf was written, but the poem contains references . to both Christianity and paganism, suggesting that it might date to the . period of conversion when Oswald ruled. Mr Adams says that he is not the first scholar to link the heroic king with the fictional warrior. 'Tolkien . thought there was a link between Oswald and Beowulf', Mr Adams told . MailOnline - adding that the character of Aragorn might have been . created as a composite of both men. In . Beowulf, the eponymous hero leaves his home, the land of the Geats, to . fight on behalf of the Danes, before returning to claim the Geat throne. The . story bears striking similarities to that of Oswald, an exile who won . back his birthright - not to mention that of Aragorn's quest to become . king of Gondor after helping lead the mission to destroy the . all-powerful Ring. Oswald was successful in battle and finally became king of Northumbria at the age of 30. He subsequently expanded his power, and was said by later Anglo-Saxons to have been the overlord of all England, as well as receiving tribute from the Scots and the Welsh. However, Mr Adams claims that Oswald's greatest achievement was not political, but cultural - fulfilling his vow to St Columba, the king set up a new monastery, populated by Irish monks, on the island of Lindisfarne. The community is now famous for producing the Lindisfarne Gospels, one of the most magnificent manuscripts in history, but Mr Adams insists that its significance, as the first religious institution set up by an English king, is much greater. 'It's the first state institution since Roman times,' the author told MailOnline. 'Oswald is the king who first makes Britain Christian - he binds church and state together.' The tradition of state-backed religion started by Lindisfarne was responsible for many of the key moments in British history, according to Mr Adams, from the Crusades to the Reformation. Oswald also seems to have had an impact on the English landscape, by developing the unique palace site of Yeavering, a few miles from the modern border with Scotland. This stronghold, occupied by several generations of Northumbrian kings, has been found to contain not only the drinking halls which many associate with the medieval period, but a bizarre 'grandstand' where kings could address their subjects or vice versa. Palace: Yeavering, now a desolate site near the Scottish border, was a thriving royal complex in Oswald's time . Remnants: 'Oswald's gate' is the only part of the seventh-century fortress at Bamburgh which survives today . Death: 'Oswald's well' in Oswestry, Shropshire is said to mark the site where the king died in 642 . Oswald ruled for eight years, before being killed in battle by the pagan King Penda, of neighbouring Mercia, at the battle of Maserfield - thought to have taken place near the town of Oswestry in Shropshire. Under normal Dark Age circumstances, that might have been the end of his Northumbrian kingdom - but thanks to the institutions created by Oswald, his younger brother Oswiu was able to take over, and the state survived intact. 'For the first time, there's an idea that the state might survive the king, which is the beginning of the world we live in today,' Mr Adams says. Despite Oswald's importance in forging the origins of the English government, we know very little about him as an individual person. The Venerable Bede, the great historian who told us nearly everything we know about seventh-century England, was more interested in religious controversy than in the personality of kings. Book: King Oswald's story is told in a biography by Max Adams entitled The King in the North . 'We can't tell how tall he is, or what . he looks like,' Mr Adams says.  'But he's probably more magical because . we don't know enough to know what a thug he probably was.' Oswald is not the only Anglo-Saxon king who helped craft the world we live in today - Offa, Alfred the Great and Ethelred the Unready were at least as influential - but Mr Adams says he perfectly embodies the clash of values which defined the transition from the ancient past to an England we can still recognise. In The King in the North, Mr Adams writes: 'In Oswald, pagan and Christian, British and Germanic, sacral and temporal were fused as in no other king of the early medieval period.' As a resident of the far north of England, the author was also attracted to Oswald because of the possibility of re-tracing the landscape where he lived, whether by returning to landmarks such as Lindisfarne (also known as Holy Island) and Bamburgh Castle, or by mapping out the smaller centres of power which defined how people lived. One previous writer who seems to have been inspired by the story of Oswald was Tolkien - who, when not penning his tales of Middle Earth, was Professor of Anglo-Saxon at the University of Oxford. Mr Adams believes that Oswald's return to his homeland after a long exile, winning the throne by bravery in battle, inspired the character of Aragorn, who joins Frodo the hobbit on a quest to destroy the Ring before returning to Gondor, the land of his ancestors, and claiming his rightful place as king. 'Tolkien is extremely familiar with Oswald's story,' the author says. 'He fulfils that need for a heroic type. The idea of the returning righteous hero is absolutely central to Tolkien's work.' According to Mr Adams, both Oswald and Aragorn fulfil a universal human need - the desire for a comeback, which can still be a powerful narrative for modern-day sportsmen and celebrities. While the seventh-century king is little-known today, he was famous across Europe for several centuries after his death - not as a ruler, but as a saint. Oswald's legacy continued throughout the medieval period, as his bones were scattered around Europe and treasured by the religious communities which held them.

"Sir Michael Wilshaw, Ofsted Chief Inspector, has announced that poor white children are now least likely to succeed at school . Poor white children in rural areas and coastal towns have been revealed as the the biggest under-performers in British schools. A report from Ofsted, set to be released later this week, outlines how the worst-performing pupils are now found in coastal towns and villages in the east and south-east of England. It is a dramatic shift from twenty years ago, when inner city pupils in large cities like London and Birmingham and ethnic minorities were the least likely to succeed academically. Now these children achieve exam results above the national average, while pupils in towns such as Hastings in East Sussex and Great Yarmouth in Norfolk are floundering at school. The findings were laid out by Ofsted's chief inspector of schools Sir Michael Wilshaw. He said: 'Many of these disadvantaged children live in areas that might be considered affluent but nonetheless are performing poorly. 'We need new policies and approaches to deal with underachievement in these areas.' The report, Access and Achievement, shows that poor British white pupils are the lowest performing ethnic group and since 2007 their qualification attainment has improved by just 13 per cent. By comparison, Bangladeshi pupils of a similar background have jumped by 22 per cent. Sir Michael, a former headteacher, told the Sunday Times: 'Where those youngsters aren't getting jobs, then they will be attracted to organisations like the English Defence League, and we need to worry about that as a society.' Although the gulf in achievement between the richest and poorest pupils in cities is closing, it remains 'stubbornly wide' elsewhere. The report, the first into the academic gap between rich and poor in a decade, also states that children from affluent families are nearly twice as likely to leave school with five good GCSEs than those from underprivileged backgrounds. Sir Michael announced measures to tackle the disparity, such as more closely monitoring schools and encouraging successful schools to support those nearby that are struggling. Change: Twenty years ago inner city pupils in large cities like London and Birmingham and ethnic minorities were the least likely to succeed academically . Earlier this week Sir Michael said children should be placed in sets from the age of 11 because state schools are failing to help the most gifted reach their potential. Mixed ability classes in particular are responsible for stunting their development because they are pitched at average pupils, he said. ‘Too many non-selective schools are failing to nurture scholastic excellence. While the best of these schools provide excellent opportunities, many of our most able students receive mediocre provision,' he added. ‘Put simply, they are not doing well enough because their secondary schools fail to challenge and support them sufficiently from the beginning.'","Ofsted chief says poorer white pupils in rural areas struggle at school .

"Earlier this week, charts revealed a number of rappers, including the group Wu Tang Clan, may have a wider vocabulary than Shakespeare did - and now researchers have taken this lyrical analysis a step further. As part of the Drug Slang in Hip Hop project, researchers studied the prevalence of different drugs in rap lyrics to plot how the popularity of substances have changed since the late 1980s. It found that weed and cocaine have consistently been prevalent in rap music, alcohol is on the decline and pharmaceutical drugs have seen a dramatic rise in recent years. As part of the Drug Slang in Hip Hop project, researchers studied the prevalence of different drugs in rap lyrics to plot how the popularity of substances has changed. This graph tracks the historical references of weed in hip-hop music. It peaked in the early 1990s and has remained consistently high ever since. The researchers found weed is still the most commonly referenced drug in rap music today . The top five rappers who made the most references to weed, cocaine, pharmaceutical drugs, codeine and MDMA . The charts also reveal how changes in political policy and society can directly influence rap lyrics. The researchers began by gathering data from the Rap Genius site – the same one used in Matt Daniel’s vocabulary study. In the context of the charts, prevalence of a drug was based on the total number of rap songs referencing that drug in a year, divided by the total number of songs released annually. The researchers excluded certain substances and slang phrases to prevent the results from becoming skewed. For example, heroin was left out because it is sometimes referred to as ‘boy’ - a common word used in other contexts. The stacked area graphs highlight the prevalence of different phrases, and therefore drug references, by nature of their vertical height. Historically, weed and cocaine have been the most prevalent drugs in rap lyrics, according to the research. Weed equally came out on top . as the most-mentioned substance in rap music today. The analysis revealed weed began its reign in the early 1990s with a steep increase from previous years, and has remained consistently high ever . since. This was reflected in society. In 1977, 11 states decriminalised marijuana possession, but during the 1980s . political policies about illicit drugs and the prosecution of . non-violent drug offenses increased. During the 1992 presidential election, Bill Clinton then voiced his opinion favouring treatment over incarceration. Cocaine was already popular in rap music during the late 1980s, the date the researchers began their analysis, but its prevalence dipped in the early 1990s. By 2004, prevalence was the highest it had ever been but towards the end of the decade its popularity fell again in line with a rising popularity of pharmaceutical drugs. A drop in cocaine references were also mirrored with a drop in alcohol-related lyrics . Pharmaceutical drugs were hardly mentioned in rap songs during the 1990s but over the past 20 years - and in particular since 2007 - their prevelance has soared. Morphine and oxy were the main pharmaceutical drugs mentioned in rap music prior to the mid-1990s. Since then, other prescription medications have become notorious for appearing in hip-hop songs including Adderall and Xanax . Example lyrics that include drug references include Jay Z's, pictured left, 2009 song Empire State of Mind, in which he raps 'MDMA got you feeling like a champion.' While Snoop Lion, previously known as Snoop Dogg, pictured right, has consistently rapped about weed in songs including his 'The Weed Iz Mine' collaboration with Wiz Khalifa in 2011, and references to 'real sticky icky' in Still D.R.E with Dr Dre in 1999 . And between 1992 and 2006, official . figures suggest the price of marijuana fell by 16 per cent while its . potency shot up 53 per cent and this may have influenced the rise in . related lyrics. Cocaine was already popular in rap music during the late 1980s, the date . the researchers began their analysis, but its prevalence dipped slightly in the . early 1990s. From 1996 to 2009, cocaine then became the drug . of choice for rap lyrics, and only marijuana proved more popular before . and after this time period. The charts also reveal that the year 2000 marked the beginning of a steep rise in codeine syrup's inclusion in rap songs. The prescription-strength cough syrup is also known as purple drank. Despite a brief dip in the mention of the drug around 2008, recent lyrics have shown an increased use of the syrup mixed with alcohol, soda, juice, or, as in the case of 'sizzurp,' Jolly Ranchers. Its sale and use has reportedly led to an escalation in crime and pharmacy robberies, added the researchers . According to the study, rapper Lil B, pictured left, made the most references to cocaine, MDMA, and codeine, including the I'm Heem lyric 'yeah dough fiend, drink mean, like codeine.' Eminem, pictured right, included the most references to the pharmaceutical drugs. For example, in I'm Having A Relapse track he raps 'pop a Xanax, relax' Alcohol's prevelance in rap lyrics has been the most changeable, pictured. It's consistently been popular, but particular brands have fallen in and out of favour. Rappers still have a preference for Hennessy cognac, also known as Henny, and its popularity began in the mid 1990s. While the prevalence of Patron and Cristal, which peaked in the mid and late 2000s respectively, has begun to taper off. The charts reveal that alcohol in general is now declining in rap lyrics, seemingly being replaced by illicit drugs . This chart reveals the number of songs mentioning the different drugs, including weed, cocaine, pharmaceutical drugs, codeine and MDMA . By 2004, prevalence of cocaine was the highest it had ever been, but . towards the end of the decade its popularity fell again in line with a . rising popularity in mentions of pharmaceutical drugs. A drop in cocaine references . were also mirrored with a drop in alcohol-related lyrics. In addition, it seems that cocaine’s popularity started to fall around the time codeine syrup became more popular. After experiencing a brief dip in the early 1990s, there was a significant shift in the prevalence of alcohol brand mentions in hip hop. In particular, several different brands have increased in popularity over the past decade. The research revealed rappers have long had a preference for Hennessy cognac, also known as Henny, and this popularity began in the mid 1990s. While the prevalence of Patron and Cristal, which peaked in the mid and late 2000s respectively, has begun to taper off. The charts reveal that alcohol in general is declining in rap lyrics, seemingly being replaced by illicit drugs. MDMA was one of the least mentioned drugs overall in the rap music analysed, and ‘molly’, the drug’s powdered form, began featuring in lyrics from around 2009. Morphine and oxy were the main pharmaceutical drugs mentioned in rap music prior to the mid-1990s. Since then, other prescription medications have become notorious for appearing in hip-hop songs. ‘Along with the steep rise in various . pain killers, including Percs, Lortab, and hydrocodone since the . mid-2000s, Adderall’s popularity has surged’, explained the researchers. ‘Rappers such as Danny . Brown, lyricist of ‘Adderall Admiral,’ explain they take it to help them . work, especially to counterbalance the often lazing effects of . marijuana.’ The charts reveal that the year 2000 marked the beginning of a steep rise in codeine syrup’s inclusion in rap songs.

"Theresa May has admitted she has ¿grave¿ concerns about fraud in the student visa system . Theresa May has admitted she has ‘grave’ concerns about fraud in the student visa system, which allows 200,000 foreigners into Britain each year. The Home Secretary said despite Government efforts to crack down on visa abuse, applicants were ‘finding other ways around the system’. Mrs May made her comments after she was confronted with evidence from a BBC Panorama investigation exposing rampant fraud in the student visa system. The programme exposed widespread abuse, including language tests at ‘trusted’ colleges taken by fluent English speakers, and multiple choice tests in which answers were read out by the invigilators. It also revealed a network of criminal immigration agents providing, for a fee, any document required to get around Home Office checks. Consultants offered undercover reporters a guaranteed pass in an English language test for £500 and a bank statement showing they had enough money to support themselves for £250. They were also offered an ‘all in’ package of everything needed for a visa for £2,800. One lawyer told the programme the student visa system was now a criminal ‘free for all’. Mrs May said the government had done a huge amount to tackle fraud, but admitted there was still abuse in the system. She told the programme: ‘The numbers of student visas have gone down and the amount of abuse has gone down. ‘But it’s clear that people are finding other ways around the system.’ She added: ‘In the immigration world you can never say you’ve done everything, you always have to look because people will look for the new way round the system. ‘I have known there is abuse of the system but well done for uncovering the further abuse that is taking place. ‘What you have shown is that people effectively go in to a situation where [the entry requirements] are being faked for them and that is a matter of grave concern.’ ‘We now have to look at the sort of documents people are providing and look at the kind of scams being undertaken behind that.’ Business Secretary Vince Cable oppose new restrictions while Yvette Cooper said the investigation showed Theresa May is presiding over a failing immigration system . Under the coalition, more than 700 colleges have been banned from bringing students in to the country from outside the EU. New tests, including English language and means testing, have been introduced to try and stop bogus students coming to Britain to work. The programme will prompt further calls for tighter controls on the student visa system. But there is significant opposition to new controls from the education sector, which makes millions every year from the 200,000 foreign students entering the country. Another 100,000 students already here have their visas extended. Liberal Democrats, including Business Secretary Vince Cable, oppose new restrictions, saying they act as a block on genuine students. Last year it emerged there may be up to 90,000 foreign students living in Britain illegally. Audits by universities and colleges threw up tens of thousands of students accused of breaking the rules by failing to attend their courses or even register. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: ‘This investigation shows Theresa May is presiding over a failing immigration system which too often focuses on the wrong thing and where illegal immigration is a growing problem. The danger of having such a weak system which is so easily and brazenly exploited is that it is unfair, undermines public confidence – and also makes it harder to maintain support for the graduate migration we need.’ The English tests seen in the report – said by Panorama to be run by company ETS – have since been suspended by the Home Office. Mrs May said: ‘This type of abuse is not acceptable and we will continue to clamp down. We have taken action and suspended the two colleges identified in the programme. ‘Applications made by students in the UK using the English Testing Service or associated with the colleges or immigration advisers mentioned in the programme have been put on hold pending the outcome of those investigations. ‘All further English language tests done through ETS in the UK have been suspended.’","Home Secretary said applicants are ‘finding other ways around the system'

"A 'supervolcano' eruption is the most catastrophic natural disaster that can hit our planet, short of an asteroid impact - and scientists now believe America's Yellowstone is more active than we thought. Two million years ago, an eruption of the supervolcano darkened the skies with ash from southern California to the . Mississippi River, releasing more than 500 cubic miles of ash into the sky. Now scientists believe that it was followed by a second eruption, around 6,000 years later - leading to fears 'explosive volcanism' from Yellowstone is more common than scientists thought. Etna erupts this year: Two million years ago, an eruption of the Yellowstone supervolcano darkened the skies with ash from southern California to the Mississippi River, releasing more than 500 cubic miles of ash into the sky . Castle Geyser and sunrise Yellowstone National Park Wyoming: Researchers now believe that the huge 'supervolcano' beneath the park is far more active than previously thought . Researchers at Washington State University and the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre say the biggest Yellowstone eruption, which created the 2 million year old Huckleberry Ridge deposit, was actually two different eruptions at least 6,000 years apart. ‘The Yellowstone volcano’s previous . behavior is the best guide of what it will do in the future,’ says Ben . Ellis, co-author and post-doctoral researcher at Washington State . University’s School of the Environment. ‘This research suggests . explosive volcanism from Yellowstone is more frequent than previously . thought.’ The eruption of super-volcanoes . dwarfs the eruptions of recent volcanoes and can trigger planetary . climate change by inducing Ice Ages and other impacts. One . such event was the Huckleberry Ridge eruption of present-day . Yellowstone Park about two million years ago, which was more than 2,000 . times larger than the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington. Short of a meteor impact, these super-eruptions are the worst environmental hazards our planet can face. Their results paint a new picture of a more active volcano than previously thought and can help recalibrate the likelihood of another big eruption in the future. Before the researchers split the one eruption into two, it was the fourth largest known to science. Steaming Mud Volcano at Yellowstone National Park in winter. Researchers now believe that the supervolcano beneath the park could be more active than thought . A car tries to outrun the dust cloud from a supervolcano in a documentary about the effects of an eruption . The new ages for each Huckleberry Ridge eruption reduce the volume of the first event to 2,200 cubic kilometers, roughly 12 percent less than previously thought. A second eruption of 290 cubic kilometers took place more than 6,000 years later. That first eruption still deserves to be called ‘super,’ as it is one of the largest known to have occurred on Earth and darkened the skies with ash from southern California to the Mississippi River. By comparison, the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens produced 1 cubic kilometer of ash. The larger blast of Oregon’s Mount Mazama 6,850 years ago produced 116 cubic kilometers of ash. A BBC documentary imagines what might happen were the supervolcano under Yellowstone to erupt again - the red area is the huge ash cloud unleashed by the eruption . The study, funded by the National Science Foundation and published in the June issue of the Quaternary Geochronology, used high-precision argon isotope dating to make the new calculations. The radioactive decay rate from potassium 40 to argon 40 serves as a ‘rock clock’ for dating samples and has a precision of .2 percent. Darren Mark, co-author and a post-doctoral research fellow at the SUERC, recently helped fine tune the technique and improve it by 1.2 percent—a small-sounding difference that can become huge across geologic time. ‘Improved precision for greater temporal resolution is not just about adding another decimal place to a number,  says Mark. ‘It's far more exciting. It's like getting a sharper lens on a camera. It allows us to see the world more clearly.’ The project asks the question: Might super-eruptions actually be products of multiple, closely spaced eruptions through time? With improved temporal resolution, in times to come, maybe super-eruptions will be not quite so super.","'Explosive volcanism from Yellowstone more frequent than thought'

"A Florida man has been sentenced to 105 years for preying on girls aged between 13 and 18 in what may be the  largest sexual extortion case in the history of the United States, authorities say. A Jacksonville federal judge gave the lengthy sentence to 31-year-old Lucas Chansle, who pleaded guilty to nine counts of producing pornography. Each count carries a sentence of 15 to 30 years as well as a $250,000 fine, New York Daily News reports. Over the course of three years, Chansler reached out to more than 300 minors in 26 states on Facebook and MySpace, concealing his identity behind more than 60 different screen names, Daily News reports. Sentenced: Lucas Chansler, 31, was sentenced by a federal judge to 105 years in prison in, what prosecutors say may be, the largest extortion case in the history of the United States . Prosecutors say he approached the girls on social media pretending to be a friend or acquaintance, he would gain the girl's trust then persuade them to expose themselves on video chat. Unbeknownst to them, he recorded it. News4Jax reports that Chansler would ask the girls, usually between the ages of 13 and 18, to video chat and would stream a video of a teenage boy masturbating to entice them. Once the girls exposed themselves, he would blackmail them into showing more, saying if they did not comply he would show the recorded video chat to their friends and ruin their reputation. Of the 350 targeted, the FBI confirmed that 103 were positively identified minors. The FBI reports that a search of Chansler's computer showed 80,000 images and videos, many of which depicted child pornography. Of the 3,000 videos the FBI found, 200 of those contained child pornographic. Targeted: Chansler targeted more than 300 girls in 26 states over the course of three years using 60 different social media accounts . He told the FBI that he targeted underage girls because adult women were 'too mart' for his schemes. Chansler was arrested in 2010 after the FBI used information given by the parents of one of Chansler's victims and worked with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to locate Chansler's St. Johns County residence, the FBI reports. The sexual extortion occurred from 2007 to 2010. In multiple videos uncovered by the FBI, many of the victims cried and begged Chansler not to make them continue. Chansler has been in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service since 2010, according to Daily News, but has not stood trial up until this year because his attorney questioned his competence, saying he suffered severe anxiety and depression, News4Jax reports. But, over the years, several psychologists have examined him saying he's very intelligent. He was even in a Master's program for pharmacy.","Lucas Chansler, 31, was sentenced by a federal judge to 105 years in prison in, what prosecutors say may be, the largest extortion case in the history of the United States .

"The NYPD is investigating if there are other potential abuse victims of actor Stephen Collins after a recording of him purportedly acknowledging that he molested underage girls was released. The audio comes from a 2012 counselling session he took part in with his estranged wife, Faye Grant. Grant has said she gave police the audio only after Collins refused to seek appropriate treatment. Scroll down for video . The NYPD is investigating if there are other potential abuse victims of actor Stephen Collins . The trial over Stephen Collins' divorce has been delayed after the attorney of his estranged wife Faye Grant withdrew from the case just hours before testimony was supposed to begin . The recording was first aired by celebrity website TMZ, but Grant denies giving it to them. The site said that two NYPD detectives have interviewed the woman Collins allegedly admitted to molesting when she was 10 and are keen to track down other potential victims. The actor has not been charged. Police looked into three cases of molestation and indecent exposure, but the alleged incidents are so old the statute of limitations has probably passed, officers believe. Collins’ divorce case with Grant has been complicated by the recording. And the 67-year-old actor has lost roles as a result of it, including a $75,000 part in the upcoming film Ted 2. His attorney Mark Vincent Kaplan said on Wednesday that the actor was also losing residual income on the 7th Heaven series. Last week it emerged that the divorce trial will be delayed because Grant’s attorney withdrew from the case just hours before testimony was supposed to begin. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Scott Gordon, the presiding judge over divorce cases, granted a motion by attorney Larry Ginsberg to withdraw from the case on November 5. Judge Mark Juhas, who was slated to preside over the trial, ordered the proceedings to be delayed until January 5 to give Grant time to find a new lawyer. The former couple had been scheduled to start an eight-day trial on how to divide their assets and how much spousal support Grant should receive. Collins, who starred in the series 7th Heaven, was not present in court. Grant represented herself at a hearing in which the trial was delayed and her estranged husband's lawyer sought to reduce her spousal support payments. Kaplan said having Ginsberg withdraw hours before the trial's start would be 'visiting a terrible hardship on Mr. Collins.' He said the actor has spent $1 million already on attorneys' and experts' fees in the case, and the delay would probably cost him another $200,000. Collins contends that his estranged wife should receive no support because the recording from a 2012 couple's counseling session and its subsequent posting by celebrity website TMZ has destroyed his career. Gordon ruled on the motion after meeting in closed session with Ginsberg and Grant. Kaplan, Collins' attorney, was kept out of the proceedings so that Ginsberg could give details on why he was leaving the case abruptly. Collins had worked steadily in television and movie roles since the early 1970s, including appearing in the 1979 movie Star Trek: The Motion Picture, left, . Gordon said Ginsberg's motion was not motivated by an effort to delay the trial and that there was a complete breakdown in the lawyer's communications with Grant. Collins filed for divorce in 2012 and most of the issues in the case have been about money, although Grant included details about the molestation allegations in court filings last year. Grant, also an actress, has said in court filings she put her career largely on hold during her marriage to Collins, is seeking to maintain $13,000 a month in spousal support payments. Juhas refused a request by Kaplan to reduce Collins' support payments immediately.","Stephen Collins allegedly recorded admitting he molested underage girls .

"The outlook for the economy is worsening, international experts said yesterday. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development expects output to shrink by 0.7 per cent this year – far worse than the 0.5 per cent growth it had predicted in May. Coalition ministers warned however that there was no ‘quick fix’ for the economy while ridiculing Labour’s solution to add more debt. Hard times: The UK is unlikely to pull out of its double-dip recession this quarter, global economic think tank the OECD has warned, meaning more suffering for British businesses and consumers . The Paris-based OECD also cut its forecasts for other major developed countries including Germany, France and Italy. But the UK downgrade was by far the . worst and came as a blow to Chancellor George Osborne’s battle to drag . the economy out of recession and wipe out the  deficit inherited from . Labour. David Cameron said yesterday that it . was difficult to kickstart growth: ‘If there was a button you could push . in Whitehall which just said “right, growth comes” I would have pushed . it long ago. What the Government can do is set the . conditions for growth, provide that background of low interest rates, . low tax rates – which we’ve done in this country – a steady and sensible . government, then we’ll find that households will want to come forward . and business will want to come forward and invest.’ In the Commons, Liberal Democrat . Business Secretary Vince Cable exploded with uncharacteristic anger as . Labour challenged the Government’s economic record. He said Britain’s problems stemmed . from a Labour boom that was allowed to go ‘out of control’, with ‘broken . banks, a very serious consumer debt problem and very major problems in . our export market’. World in crisis: This table shows the OECD's predictions for annualised quarter-on-quarter growth in the G7 economies . In a speech in Scotland last night, . Mr Osborne admitted the economic outlook remained uncertain but insisted . there were some positive signs. He said: ‘Our economy is healing – . jobs are being created, manufacturing and exports have grown as a share . of our economy, our trade with the emerging world is soaring, inflation . is down, much of the necessary deleveraging in our banking system has . been achieved, and the world is once again investing in Britain. ‘But the scale of the challenge is so great there are no quick fixes or easy routes to recovery. ‘Nobody is offering a credible or . convincing alternative economic strategy. There is no easy path to . recovery and prosperity. We in Britain have to confront our problems . head on, be honest about the scale of the challenge, and be consistent . in our determination to succeed.’ Britain is in the worst double-dip recession for more than 50 years and the longest period of economic weakness for a century. The slump which started in 2008 . outstrips even the Great Depression of the 1930s. Possible booster: The OECD's predictions do not take into account the effect of the London Olympics, which may help to boost the economy. However initial signs have been that it has not had the expected impact . However, analysts said . the OECD outlook for the UK was ‘overly pessimistic’ because it did not . take account of any bounce back from the disruption caused by the . Queen’s Diamond Jubilee. The International Monetary Fund has . cut its 2012 forecast to 0.2 per cent growth while the Bank of England . is expecting stagnation. The OECD has been one of Mr Osborne’s most influential supporters and has defended the Chancellor’s austerity plans. Pier Carlo Padoan, of the OECD, said . the slump was down to global factors, such as the eurozone, and added . that the Chancellor’s plan to tackle the deficit was ‘appropriate’. Rachel Reeves, a Labour Treasury . spokesman, said: ‘These very concerning forecasts show just how badly . the Government’s economic policies have failed. ‘David Cameron and George Osborne need to stop clinging on to their failed economic plan and change course now. ‘Without a serious plan for jobs and growth we won’t get the deficit down.’ The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street: Despite the warnings, the Bank of England maintained interest rates at 0.5 per cent and held its quantitative easing programme at £375billion .","International experts expect output to shrink by 0.7 per cent this year .

"The US military has deployed its first laser weapon ever to be used in combat. The science fiction made real armament is seven years in the making and comes at a cost of $40 million. Dubbed the 30-kilowatt-class Laser Weapon System, the devices was installed onto the USS Ponce in August, where the warship has been patrolling with it ever since. Navy officials say the weapon can set fire to targets at the speed of light. Those targets include aerial drones, speed boats and swarm boats, all potential threats to warships in the Persian Gulf, where the Ponce, a floating staging base, is deployed. Zap: The Navy officially launched the Laser Weapon System in August, the first ever laser combat weapon . Bloomberg reports that the system was given the okay for use in the field after passing a series of at-sea tests. 'I have to take it out and get it wet, and the Arabian Gulf's a pretty tough environment,' Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jonathan Greenert said. For the Navy, it's not so much about the whiz-bang technology as it is about the economics of such an armament, which costs pennies on the dollar compared with missiles and smart bombs, and the weapons can be fired continuously, unlike missiles and bombs, which eventually run out. The weapon has several power levels. The laser weapon system (LaWS) prototype combines light beams from six commercial, off-the-shelf solid-state welding lasers. Each beam has a power of 5.5 kilowats, to create a laser with a total power of round 33 kW. The light from the six lasers is said to be incoherently combined because the individual beams are not merged into a true single beam (i.e., the individual beams are not brought in phase with each other). Speed of light: Navy officials say the weapon can set fire to targets at the speed of light. Those targets include aerial drones, speed boats and swarm boats, all potential threats to warships in the Persian Gulf, where the Ponce, a floating staging base, is deployed . The laser actually uses six separate, commercial welding lasers that combine into a more powerful series of beams that can set fire to moving targets . Although the beams are quite close to one another, they remain separate and out of phase with each other, and are steered and focused by the beam director so that they converge into a single spot when they reach the intended target. Coherently combining the six beams into a true single beam (i.e., one in which the six beams are “phase locked”) would require a system with more-complex internal optics and electronic control systems. Source: Congressional Research Service . Persian Gulf: The laser system is mounted aboard the USS Ponce, which is patrolling the Persian Gulf and plans to use the weapon to fend of troublesome Iranian 'swarm' forces that use several smaller boats to attack much larger vessels . It may be used as a 'dazzling' warning shot to deter enemies or turned 'all the way up to lethal' said Chief of Naval Research Rear Admiral Matthew Klunder.' The weapon's range remains classified. Shooting the laser costs about $1 per shot, according to the Navy's July 31 report. Just like in the movies, the Navy's laser directs a beam of energy that can burn through a target or fry sensitive electronics. Unlike the movie, the laser beam is invisible to the human eye. The targeting system locks onto the target, sending a beam of searing heat. The Navy hopes that the laser will be invaluable in combating the small Iranian fast boats and surveillance drones that harass U.S. vessels in the area. This earlier iteration of the weapon is one of multiple prototypes tested. The current prototype was give the okay for use in the field after at-sea testing .","The solid-state Laser Weapon System is designed to target what the Navy describes as 'asymmetrical threats'

"Within a month of Apple's latest handsets going on sale, figures have revealed its customers flocked to buy the smaller model. The iPhone 6 accounted for 68 per cent of all sales through September and into early October, while its larger model took between 23 and 24 per cent. Apple's cheaper iPhone 5S and 5C handsets made up the rest of the sales. Scroll down for video . The iPhone 6 (pictured left) accounted for 68 per cent of all iPhone sales, during the first 30 days of launch, while its larger iPhone 6 Plus model (right) took between 23 and 24 per cent, according to figures from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners . Following last year's launch, the 5S and 5C accounted for 84 per cent of total iPhone sales in the first 30 days - proving the 6 range is more popular. The skew is being blamed on reports that stocks of the iPhone 6 Plus are lower because Apple is struggling to complete orders. The figures come from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIPR) analyst Steven Milunovich. He also noted that more people are buying larger models of the devices, in terms of storage, with the average capacity reported as 48GB. As Apple Insider points out, this is almost double last year's figure, but may be due to the fact Apple has removed the 32GB model from the range, offering a 16GB, 64GB and 128GB as standard. A separate CIPR report, from analysts Joshua Lowitz and Michael Levin, found that fewer people switched from Android to iOS this year, compared to last year. In September 2013, 23 per cent of iPhone customers said they had previously owned an Android phone, but this year the figure was closer to 12 per cent. The chart below shows which iPhones people who previously owned Android handsets bought this year, and last year. A separate CIPR report, from analysts Joshua Lowitz and Michael Levin, found that fewer people switched from Android to iOS this year, compared to last year. In September 2013, 23 per cent of iPhone customers said they had previously owned an Android phone, but this year the figure was closer to 12 per cent. But, it explained that although there were fewer people making the switch, those who did, chose the more expensive iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models, rather than the iPhone 5C and 5S. Typically, Android owners opt for cheaper iPhones - but this year was an exception. Last month, T-Mobile boss chief executive John Legere said the iPhone 6 Plus was 'exceeding expectations' - and was on par with the smaller iPhone 6 model. He said he had expected the Plus model to make up around 20 per cent of sales, but this figure has been closer to 45 per cent. Mr Legere was talking at Recode’s Code/Mobile event in Moon Bay California. He admitted the figures were more than twice the sales his firm had expected. These figures bolster those observed on the weekend the two devices were released back in September. A Piper Jaffray survey found the larger model was outselling the smaller version, and analyst Gene Munster said at the time the Plus was ‘more popular’. Following the launch, Apple reported it sold more than 10 million iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models (pictured) in a weekend - a three-day record for a new model. This beat the previous record of 9 million for last year's iPhone 5S and 5C. The 5S and 5C accounted for 84 per cent of total iPhone sales in the first 30 days in 2013 . In September 2013, 23 per cent of iPhone customers said they had previously owned an Android phone, but this year the figure was closer to 12 per cent. This chart reveals the number of people who have switched from a rival operating system and bought an iPhone in September 2013 and 2014 . In a survey, 57 per cent of shoppers intended to buy the iPhone Plus; with the larger screen, as well as the storage options, cited as the main driving forces. The iPhone 6 has a 4.7-inch screen, while the iPhone 6 Plus 5.5-inches. Both models include the Apple-designed A8 chip with second generation 64-bit desktop-class architecture, said to boost performance and power efficiency. They also have advanced iSight and FaceTime HD cameras, and users in the US can also to use the devices to pay for goods using Apple Pay. Besides larger screens, the new phones offer faster performance and a wireless chip for making credit card payments. In the US, the iPhone 6 starts at $199 for 32GB on a two-year contact, $299 for 64GB and $399 for 128GB. A SIM-only handset starts at £539 in the UK. The iPhone 6 Plus costs $299 on a two-year contract for 16GB, $399 for 64GB, $499 for 128GB. Unlocked, the handset starts at £619 in the UK. Prior to the release, the firm said it expected customers would ‘overwhelmingly’ prefer the smaller iPhone 6 - seen as the direct upgrade to the iPhone 5S. Figures from marketing firm Localytics earlier this month, however, reported a skew in the opposite direction. By studying app usage and analytics across a range of devices, its figures show the iPhone 6 taking 6 per cent market share, compared to the Plus model’s one per cent. The firm also found that the iPhone 6 is being adopted at twice the rate of its iPhone 5S predecessor - which had a three per cent share of all iPhones at this time last year. Although people who have bought the larger model are using it more. According to Localytics, the iPhone 6 Plus has ‘stronger user engagement’ with 13 per cent longer session length, and 11 per cent more app launches than the iPhone 6. Currently, last year’s iPhone 5S is the most popular model among consumers at 27 per cent of all iPhones. Following the launch in September, Apple reported it sold more than 10 million iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models over the first weekend - a three-day record for a new model. This beat the previous record of 9 million for last year's iPhone 5S and 5C. According to app analytics firm Localytics, the iPhone 6 Plus has ‘stronger user engagement’ than its smaller cousin, with 13 per cent longer session length, and 11 per cent more app launches than the iPhone 6 . During initial benchmark tests by Anandtech, the iPhone 6 was found to have the fastest web browsing and page loading times on any device, just ahead of the iPhone 6 Plus. The iPhone 6 also performed well in graphics testing, coming second with an average frame per second rate of 49.5. This was only behind the NVIDIA Shield tablet, on 57.1. The iPhone 5S was third, on 40.2, followed by the iPhone 6 Plus on 34.4. Furthermore, the display on the iPhone 6 Plus was praised by experts at DisplayMate, who called the screen ‘the best performing smartphone LCD’ the site has ever tested. Separate figures from Localytics report a sales skew in the same direction.

"People with high IQ scores aren't just more intelligent - they also process sensory information differently, according to new study. Scientists discovered that the brains of people with high IQ are automatically more selective when it comes to perceiving moving objects, meaning that they are more likely to suppress larger and less relevant background motion. ‘It is not that people with high IQ are simply better at visual perception,’ said Duje Tadin of the University of Rochester. ‘Instead, their visual perception is more discriminating.' Scientists discovered that the brains of people with high IQ are more selective when perceiving objects in motion, meaning that they are more likely to ignore larger and less relevant background motion . 'They excel at seeing small, moving objects but struggle in perceiving large, background-like motions.’ The discovery was made by asking people to watch videos showing moving bars on a computer screen. Their task was to state whether the bars were moving to the left or to the right. That ability to block out distraction helps to explain what makes some brains more efficient than others . The researchers measured how long the video had to run before the individual could correctly perceive the motion. The results show that individuals with high IQ can pick up on the movement of small objects faster than low-IQ individuals can. 'That wasn't unexpected, Tadin says. The surprise came when tests with larger objects showed just the opposite: individuals with high IQ were slower to see what was right there in front of them. ‘There is something about the brains of high-IQ individuals that prevents them from quickly seeing large, background-like motions,’ Tadin added. In other words, it isn't a conscious strategy but rather something automatic and fundamentally different about the way these people's brains work. The ability to block out distraction is very useful in a world filled with more information than we can possibly take in. It helps to explain what makes some brains more efficient than others. An efficient brain 'has to be picky' Tadin said. The findings were reported in the Cell Press journal Current Biology. An intelligence quotient or IQ is a score derived from a set of standardised tests developed to measure a person's cognitive abilities or ‘intelligence’ in relation to their age group. IQ tests do not measure intelligence the way a ruler measures height , but rather the way a race measures speed. Modern IQ tests produce scores for different areas  - such as language fluency and three-dimensional thinking - with the overall score calculated from subtest scores. The average score, according to the bell curve, is 100. Studies have linked IQ scores to morbidity and mortality and even social status. The average IQ scores for many populations have been rising at an average rate of three points per decade since the early 20th century, a phenomenon called the Flynn effect. It is disputed whether these changes in scores reflect real changes in intellectual abilities.","Experts found that a high IQ brain was better able to block out larger or more irrelevant images when focussing on a small moving object .

"Standing confidently on the beach, with a rifle casually slung over her shoulder, you would think twice about knocking over this woman's sandcastle. The bikini-clad subject is thought to be a solider and a member of the highly-trained Israeli Defence Forces. Since the surprising photo, snapped in Tel Aviv, was posted on the internet it has gone viral with many users reacted with shock at seeing such a hostile weapon on a sunny beach. Where to keep the spare bullets? The photo, which is thought to be an an Israeli soldier relaxing on the sand, became an internet phenomenon after being posted on the internet . Some internet users were perplexed as to why the woman in the photo would be at the beach with a rifle- which does not appear to have a magazine loaded - but not in her uniform. But other users were quick to point out there could have been practical reasons for the solider to take the weapon to the beach. Under Israeli military regulations, if members take their weapon out from their military base they must keep them near at all times. Punishments for losing or misplacing a weapon can include time in a military prison. The photo, which has now been viewed hundreds of thousands of users, seems to have originated on . Facebook under the title 'Only in Israel' and then spread across the . internet, including onto the social news website Reddit. Usual dress code: Israeli female soldiers man an army checkpoint - Israel's compulsory military service means that almost the entire female population must spend two years in the military after reaching 18 . One . user on the website wrote: 'An explanation for this photo (I served in . the IDF): the girl probably went to beach right after being at the base . and serves in a unit that requires her to carry a weapon (not . necessarily a combat role), she didn't want to go through the paperwork . and permission required to leave the gun at armory. 'Outside of the base we're required to either lock our weapons or have them on us. You can clearly see what she chose.' Another user wrote: 'The photo is taken on the beach in Tel Aviv, and it is commonplace to see such sights during the summer.' Israel's compulsory military service means that almost the entire female population must spend two years in the military after reaching 18. Women make up almost one-third of the force, and 50 per cent of its officers, making the Isreale Defence Forces one of the most gender-equal units in the world. It is not the first time that women from the IDF have been photographed in their bikinis on the beach. In a bid to promote tourism, in 2007,  Israel's Foreign Ministry backed a public . relations campaign out of its consulate in New York showing former . female soldiers in minimal wear on its sunny beaches. 'We want to make people in the world to see Israel through our glasses,' said Aviv Shiron, Deputy Director General for Media and Public Affairs in the Israeli Foreign Ministry. 'The image of Israel is not only men, either armed in uniform, or . Jewish orthodox dressed in black...you have beautiful women here,' added Mr . Shiron. In the same year a spread in July's issue of Maxim magazine featured female Israeli ex-soldiers in bikinis headlined 'Women of the Israel Defence Forces.'","Women make up almost one-third of the IDF and 50% of its officers .

"The new Defence Secretary personally overruled an ‘outrageous and juvenile’ attempt to make the Red Arrows trail the colours of the Scottish flag at the Commonwealth Games. Michael Fallon reacted with fury when told of the plan for the famous jet display team, part of Britain’s Royal Air Force, to replace their traditional red, white and blue smoke with just white and blue, representing the Scottish Saltire. It would have been a highly political statement just weeks ahead of a referendum in Scotland on whether the country should become independent, breaking up the 300-year-old union with England. Scroll down for video . A guide handed to journalists stated that the Red Arrows would use only blue and white smoke, apparently recreating the Scottish Saltire . The nine Hawk jets in the Red Arrows aerobatic display team flew over Celtic Park as the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh were driven into the arena . A guide handed to journalists at Wednesday night’s spectacular opening ceremony stated that as the Queen’s car came into the stadium, the ‘nine hawks of the Red Arrows fly overhead in a v-formation trailing blue and white smoke’. However, in the event, the jets trailed their traditional three colours, representing the Union Flag, to huge cheers from the 40,000-strong crowd inside Glasgow’s Celtic Park. TV images of the flypast, and the warmth of the welcome extended by the Scottish crowd to the Monarch, were seen as a blow to nationalist First Minister Alex Salmond’s campaign to persuade Scots to back independence in the September 18 referendum. A senior Government source revealed the request for the Red Arrows to produce white and blue smoke was overruled at the last minute by Mr Fallon, appointed to lead the Ministry of Defence in last week’s wide-ranging Government reshuffle. New Defence Secretary Michael Fallon blocked the attempt to paint the Saltire in the sky over Glasgow . ‘Michael Fallon personally refused the request. They wanted white and blue, but the Red Arrows are part of the Royal Air Force, keeping all of Britain safe. ‘The Secretary of State was not about to let politics interfere with our Armed Forces,’ the source said. A defence source added: ‘It’s just bizarre. Can you imagine England asking for just red and white for their events? Or Wales doing this same? ‘The Red Arrows have never flown with any other colours because they represent the United Kingdom. That’s what they do. You cannot request different colours.’ Former Labour defence minister John Spellar said: ‘Frankly, this would have been both outrageous and juvenile. In their reaction to the Red Arrows trailing red, white and blue, the Scottish crowd gave a very clear answer to the people who wanted to play games with the Games.’ Mr Salmond promised not to play politics with the Commonwealth Games, saying he would not use the event to push his campaign for Scottish independence. However, opponents say he has already broken that pledge by predicting this week that Glasgow will vote yes in the referendum and become ‘Freedom City’. The First Minister also used a press conference at the Games’ main media centre to attack George Osborne and suggest Scottish sporting teams would ‘flourish’ after independence. Mr Salmond has been accused of hijacking major sporting events in the past – prompting fury when he unfurled a Scottish flag behind the Prime Minister’s head when Andy Murray won Wimbledon last year. Mr Murray condemned the stunt, saying he ‘didn’t like it’. The Scottish First Minister also urged people to back ‘Scolympians’, a term he personally coined instead of Team GB to describe Scotland’s competitors at the 2012 London Olympics. The aerobatic display team's appearance in the skies over Glasgow was one of the highlights of the spectacular opening ceremony of the 2014 Commonwealth Games . Crowds in the Live Zone outside the main arena captured their own photos of the smoke trails against the sunset . Red Arrows insiders insist they only ever use red, white and blue smoke, wherever they are booked to perform . Commonwealth Games organisers blamed a typing error in the guide which could not be corrected before it went to press . In an initial statement, a spokesman for the Commonwealth Games said that there had been no plan for the Red Arrows to trail blue and white smoke, and the reference to such a flypast in the guide had been a typing error. ‘It was a mistake that was done in the editing. It was always the case that there would be the three colours,’ the spokesman said. But later, the position changed. A spokesman said: 'Glasgow 2014 would like to clarify that it was its ceremony’s producers who had initial conversations about Red Arrows trailing blue and white smoke to represent the host nation’s Saltire, but this was never formally requested. 'We were delighted with the participation of the Red Arrows who deployed their standard trail of red, white and blue in the ceremony.' A source close to Mr Salmond insisted the First Minister had not been aware of the request for blue and white smoke by the Games organisers. A Scottish Government spokesman said: ‘The Scottish Government made no such approach regarding the Red Arrows whose flypast was a spectacular highlight of a fantastic opening ceremony. Any claims to the contrary are completely untrue. ‘Glasgow 2014, as organisers of the Games, independently contract a private company to organise and stage the opening and closing ceremonies. ‘An approach was made by them to the MoD to explore whether it would be possible to have blue and white smoke in recognition of Scotland as the host Commonwealth nation. We believe that ultimately the UK Government did not want to proceed with this suggestion.’ Alex Salmond has been accused of abandoning his pledge not to use the 2014 Games to score political points . The opening and closing ceremonies of the Games have been produced on behalf of the organisers by US-based brand agency Jack Morton Worldwide, which was also behind the Commonwealth Games ceremonies in Manchester in 2002 and Melbourne in 2006. It is understood the agency held informal discussions in February, and one insider suggested that initially no objections were raised to the idea of the Red Arrows using white and blue smoke. A spokesman for the Better Together campaign against Scottish independence said: ‘If there was any attempt by the nationalists to play politics like this with Glasgow's Games it will be frowned upon by Scots. ‘The Red Arrows are loved by people in Scotland and right across the whole UK.' A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: ‘The Red Arrows are ambassadors for the United Kingdom and are famous for their red, white and blue smoke trails which represent the whole of the UK. ‘The flypast was to celebrate the Glasgow Commonwealth Games, the Commonwealth and the presence of Her Majesty so it was fitting that red, white and blue were used.’ The most recent poll of polls suggests Mr Salmond’s independence dream is likely to be crushed, indicating a 14-point lead for the no campaign.","Media guide said Red Arrows would fly with only blue and white smoke .

"Mrs Hodgkinson said she could not abandon her son who became her only child after her daughter died from a rare form of cancer . A teaching assistant who was sacked from a primary school over her contact with her sex offender son has won £28,300 in compensation. Tracy Hodgkinson, 47, informed her school bosses when her 18-year-old son was arrested in November 2009 for having a relationship with an underage girl. But she claimed that they then began to try and force her out of her job after she had taught for ten years at Halifax Primary School in Ipswich, Suffolk. Her son was jailed for two-and-a-half years in May 2010 for an offence of grooming and sexual activity with a girl aged under 14. Mrs Hodgkinson was dismissed in January last year after the 362-pupil school raised concerns about her contact with her son and claimed it no long had 'trust and confidence' in her. She took her case to an employment tribunal in Bury St Edmunds Suffolk, which ruled last December that she had been unfairly dismissed. The tribunal has now awarded her compensation of £28,300, but has made no order for her to be given her job back. Mrs Hodgkinson of Ipswich said she could not abandon her son who became her only child after her daughter died from a rare form of cancer in December 2004. She said: 'It is a weight off my shoulders. The whole process has really taken its toll, my health has suffered. 'I couldn't abandon my son, he's the only child I have left. Me having contact with my son, who has paid for what he did, posed no risk to the children. 'They tried to make me pay for his . crimes. I feel I can draw a line under it all now. I am very saddened by . what has happened, but glad that I stood up and fought for what I . believed in. The teaching assistant was dismissed  after the 362-pupil school raised concerns about her contact with her son and claimed it no long had 'trust and confidence' in her . 'I still can't really believe I had the strength to stand up and fight my case in front of barristers and lawyers. 'There were times when I contemplated taking my own life, but the memory of my daughter got me through. I really hope the school has learned from what happened.' Her son was living with his father, her ex-husband, at the time he was arrested over his relationship with the girl who had no connection with Halifax Primary School . Mrs Hodgkinson informed the school's headteacher Anna Hennell-James and Janice Lee, strategic manager for the learning and improvement service at Suffolk County Council, of his arrest. She asked for some time off and was told to remain at home until the school had decided on a strategy to respond to the situation. But she claimed that a subsequent meeting with the headteacher and a council official 'turned into a disciplinary hearing'. The school later raised concerns about her not reporting that there had been a request for a friend's 15-year-old daughter to visit her son in Norwich prison. The tribunal found that the school's statement that it had lost confidence in her was 'not based on reasonable grounds'. Mrs Hodgkinson claimed the visit didn't happen after she contacted the girl's parents to ask their permission and the mother refused it. She consequently did not inform the school because she did not consider it a 'serious matter'. The prison later admitted that the visiting request should not have been issued. The school also accused her of 'associating with offenders' after she met her son at a McDonald's restaurant following his release to a bail hostel in Ipswich. When the pair met, her son had a friend from the hostel with him. Mrs Hodgkinson went to an employment tribunal after losing an appeal against her dismissal. The tribunal found that the school's statement that it had lost confidence in her was 'not based on reasonable grounds'. It also ruled that disciplinary process was full of mistakes, misunderstandings and a lack of proper consideration. Mrs Hodgkinson had also not received any formal disciplinary warnings let alone a warning that her job was at risk. There was also no evidence that she had failed to spot or safeguard the interests of any child at the school before or after her son's arrest. A spokesman for Halifax Primary Schoool said: 'We are disappointed that the tribunal did not see fit to uphold our decision to dismiss Mrs Hodgkinson. 'Our main priority has always been, and will continue to be, the safety of children in our care.' Mrs Hodgkinson said: 'I am just so pleased that the little person has fought against all odds and won. 'At the end of the day I took them on because while I know my son has done wrong - I'm not disputing that and have never condoned his crime - it was his crime, not mine. 'I had worked at the school for ten years, I loved it there and my little girl loved it there before she died. Now I can't look at it in the same way. 'After losing my daughter I couldn't just stop seeing my son. He's the only child I have left. 'After I told the school it seemed everything I did was picked up on. It feels like they have tried to make me pay for what my son did. 'Me having contact with my son poses no risk to the children. 'They [the school] have tried to make me out to be a bad person. It's been a living nightmare.'","Tracy Hodgkinson, 47, informed her school bosses when her 18-year-old son was arrested in 2009 for having a relationship with an underage girl .

"Flavored milk must be nonfat, and there's a ban on trans fat . There will be more whole grains on school lunch menus this year, along with a wider selection of fruits and vegetables and other healthy options. The challenge is getting children to eat them. 'We don't want healthy trash cans. We want kids who are eating this stuff,' said Kern Halls, a former Disney World restaurant manager who now works in school nutrition at Orange County Public Schools in Florida. At a School Nutrition Association conference in Denver this summer, food workers heard tips about how to get children to make healthy food choices in the cafeteria. The problem is a serious one for the . nation's lunch-line managers, who are implementing the biggest update to . federal school-food guidelines in 15 years. New Department of Agriculture guidelines taking effect this fall set calorie and sodium limits for school meals. First Lady Michelle Obama, see today at the White House at a 'state dinner' lunch for children, has pushed for healthier eating and more exercise for children with her Let's Move campaign . Food workers in Denver this summer heard tips about how to get children to make healthy food choices in the cafeteria and tasted samples in advance of new guidelines . Schools must offer dark green, orange or red vegetables and legumes at least once a week, and students are required to select at least one vegetable or fruit per meal. Flavored milk must be nonfat, and there's a ban on artificial, artery-clogging trans fats. The guidelines were announced as the Obamas hosted the first ever White House 'kids' state dinner' celebrating the young winners of a national healthy recipe contest - the latest effort in Mrs Obama’s 'Let’s Move' campaign to combat childhood obesity. Top junior chefs presented their culinary masterpieces to the President and First Lady while Halls demonstrated some healthy recipes for curious cafeteria managers, joining White House chef Sam Kass to prepare a veggie wrap using a whole-wheat tortilla. Halls' main mission, though, was not . pushing new recipes but teaching cafeteria managers marketing strategies . used to great success by private-sector restaurants and food producers. The . first step, cafeteria workers were told, is to stop thinking of . lunchtime as a break from academics, but a crucial part of a child's . school day. It's a wrap! Former Disney World restaurant manager Kern Halls shows how it's done . Barack and Michelle Obama hosted the first ever 'Kids' State Dinner' at the White House in Washington on Monday which honored young winners of a national healthy recipe contest . 'Your job is not to serve kids food. Your job is motivate kids to be adventurous and healthy eaters,' said Barb Mechura, head of nutrition services at schools in Hopkins, Minnesota. Her school district recruited parent volunteers to be elementary-school 'food coaches', touring cafeterias and handing out samples of fruits and vegetables. Persuasive: Leslie Cunningham-Sabo has come up with some creative ways to get kids to eat their vegetables . The food coaches would also demonstrate eating them. Food coaching may seem silly, but kids who have had chicken only as nuggets or patties may not know how to eat bone-in chicken and need to see how a grown-up eats it before trying it themselves. As the kids graduate to middle and high schools, and grown-ups in the cafeteria aren't as welcome, schools can tap student ambassadors to be food coaches, perhaps asking the baseball team or a popular student athlete dish out veggies. Or high school seniors might give underclassmen samples of a new vegetable coming to the cafeteria. School cafeterias also are using cutting-edge market research. They're filming what kids eat, test-marketing new products before they go on the line and doing menu surveys to find out exactly what students think about a dish's taste, appearance and temperature. A Colorado State University professor studied the dining habits of kids in Loveland, Colorado, with an eye toward measuring ways to get them to choose healthier foods. Leslie Cunningham-Sabo, who photographed 'before' and 'after' pictures of kids' lunch trays, found that kids eat more fruits and vegetables if they have lunch after recess, instead of before recess. She found that corn consumption went up when generic 'corn' labels were replaced with colorful cards describing the vegetable as 'mellow yellow corn'. 'Don't put veggies in opaque containers or give them boring labels like ""corn"",' Cunningham-Sabo told the lunch workers, showing diagrams of how to lay out a service line to encourage trips to the salad bar. Another trick — just like supermarkets place impulse buys like candy and chewing gum by the checkout, lunch lines should place easy-to-grab fruits and veggies by their own cash registers. The 'kids' state dinner' was the latest effort in Mrs Obama's 'Let's Move' campaign to combat childhood obesity . Star-struck: President Obama greets a boy at the 'kids' state dinner' Her study saw cafeterias double their sales of fresh fruit when they placed it colorful bowls in a convenient place. 'You really have to be in their face with what's available,' Cunningham-Sabo said. The . marketing doesn't stop at the cafeteria doors. Lassen View Elementary . School in Redding, California, got children to eat more fruits and . vegetables when cafeteria manager Kathie Sardeson started a recess snack . cart bringing the foods straight to the playground for kids to munch . on. Her school also bought . an iPad 2 to raffle away to students who entered by choosing a healthy . breakfast yogurt parfait and turning in tickets attached to the bottom. She tempted kids to try unusual flavors by giving out 'Fear Factor Smoothies' including unexpected ingredients such as spinach. Sardeson said schools can be persuaded to invest more in nutrition promotions because the payoff is better students. Healthy delicacies were on offer at the 'kids state dinner' including the Summer Fruit Garland and Strawberryana Smoothie (left) and Yummy Cabbage Sloppy Joes with Baked Zucchini Fries (right) 'We get a lot of feedback from teachers that behavior problems are way down because the kids are eating right,' Sardeson said. Educators are coming around to recognizing value in having better school food, Mechura told the cafeteria workers. 'Food is one of the most important influences on your everyday brain cells,' Mechura said. Healthy eating habits, she argued, is as important as everything else schools are trying to teach. 'We have to change,' Mechura said. 'We have to build an environment that creates excitement about what we are doing rather than fear of new foods.' U.S. Department of Agriculture guidelines for school lunches will take effect this fall, including the first national calorie and sodium limits for what can be served on lunch lines. A look at what the new guidelines require, according to the School Nutrition Association: . Grains: . Grades K-5: 8 to 9 servings per week; Grades 6-8: 8 to 10 servings per week; Grades 9-12: 10 to 12 servings per week. Students should have at least one serving of grains each day, and one-half of offerings must be rich in whole grain.Meats/Meat alternatives: . Grades K-5: 8 to 10 ounces per week; Grades 6-8: 9 to 10 ounces per week; Grades 9-12: 10 to 12 ounces per week. Nuts, tofu, cheese and eggs can be substituted for meat in some cases. Milk: . Grades K-12: 1 cup per day. Fat-free, low-fat and lactose-free milk options are allowable. Fruits: . Grades K-8: One-half cup per day; Grades 9-12: One cup per day. Only half of the weekly fruit requirement can come from juice. Vegetables: . Grades K-8: Three-quarters cup per day; Grades 9-12: One cup per day. Weekly requirements for vegetable subgroups, including dark green, red/orange, beans/peas, starchy and others. Sodium: . By July 2014, sodium levels for lunches should not exceed: . Grades K-5: 640 milligrams; Grades 6-8: 710 milligrams; Grades 9-12: 740 milligrams. A timetable sets targets for further reducing sodium levels by 2022.Fats: . No more than 10 per cent saturated fats. No trans-fat, except for those naturally occurring in meat and dairy products. Total calories: . Grades K-5: 550 to 650 per day; Grades 6-8: 600 to 700 per day; Grades 9-12: 750 to 850 per day; Calories can be averaged over the week.","New Department of Agriculture guidelines taking effect this fall set calorie, sodium and other limits for school meals .

Driver Jeremy Foley- who was participating in his first race at the well-known course- and his co-driver Yuri Kouznetsov were going predictably fast around a curve on mile 16 of the course and went off the side of the road. Video of the crash shows that the Mistubishi Evolution 8 flips either 11 or 12 times before coming to a final stop alongside some small boulders. Evolutionm.net, a Mitsubishi enthusiast's site, says that Mr Foley was able to get out of the car by himself while emergency services had to help extricate his co-driver because of a possible shoulder dislocation.

"A school in Norfolk has banned students from wearing skirts in an attempt to crack down on 'immodest' clothing styles, after giving up on the struggle to stop girls from shortening their skirts. From September, both boys and girls at Diss High School will have to wear trousers. following a school ruling. The decision has been described as 'ridiculous' and 'poorly thought out' by parents, residents and local council officials. Diss High School has been caught up in controversy following their ruling that later this year they will be banning students from wearing skirts in their school . Diss High School, Norfolk. The school  has taken the decision to ban female pupils from wearing skirts, they will only be allowed to wear trousers . In addition to banning all skirts, the . governors also backed the school's decision to ban make-up for pupils in . years 7-11; which consists of children aged 10 to 16. The decision to ban skirts was floated by a group of governors, pupils and staff, who met last year as part of a focus group on school uniform. Head teacher Dr Jan Hunt, who claims that the tendency for some girls to shorten their skirts has led to the ban . Headteacher Jan Hunt said: 'Girls already wear trousers at Diss High School. 'The reason the school is making this compulsory is the tendency for some girls to wear really short skirts. 'Hemlines have risen to a level that is both impractical as well as immodest. 'Inevitably, this decision is popular with some parents and not with others.' Dr Hunt said: 'The same responses would be true for pupils. 'Financial support will be offered to parents to support this transition.' A Norfolk County Council spokesman said: 'In terms of uniform policy that is not something we administer, it is purely down to the school to make that decision.' Councillor Florence Ellis, a former teacher, spoke out against the ban. She said: ‘I think that setting rules . and regulations is good for parents and students, adhering to them is . preparation for life. 'We lost shirts and ties to polo shirts and sweatshirts thus lowering standards. 'They should be maintaining the rules . that have been successful in the past, like monitoring skirt lengths, . rather than an overall ban. Councillor Florence Ellis originally spoke out on twitter, raising questions and pointing out problems with the practicality of the ban . 'By not conforming to rules and . regulations in something like the length of a skirt can lead at a later . date to disregard for rules/law and order and may encourage anti social . behaviour. ‘What if there are parents or students who are against wearing trousers for religious reasons? 'What . happens when it gets to summer and girls no longer want to wear . trousers in the heat? Are they going to have to wear shorts? ‘I wonder has the school really thought this through.’ Local parents and residents have also spoken out against the prospective ban. Amber Ervine, 26, said: 'I don’t know . if I agree with it. I see teenage girls walking round with tiny skirts . but I don’t know if you can ban them from wearing them.' Jane Brown said: 'I think they should be able to wear skirts so long as they are not really short. 'I would restrict the length of them so they looked respectable.' Jane Brown, of Diss, who has been vocally opposed to the ban (left) and Amber Irvine, who is on the fence about the decision (right) Teresa Mayston, 56, said: 'It is ridiculous. I think it is silly to ban them at school because it is free choice, isn’t it? 'As long as the skirt is of a certain length then I think they should be able to wear skirts. 'But unfortunately I think the rules are not being adhered to and some of the skirts are not skirts.' Alison Moore, 49, said: 'It seems unfair to me. 'You are doing something that is penalising girls.' The decision has sparked outrage from some parents and students, but others have agreed with the policy, branding the short skirts 'immodest' Zoe Taylor, 44, said: 'I like girls to look like girls. I like the feminine side of wearing a skirt as part of a uniform. 'I used to have the trouser option, but I always chose the skirt because it is more feminine. 'Unfortunately, . the way children wear uniforms nowadays is inappropriate. I am not sure . how I would enforce having a certain length of skirt that had to be . adhered to.' The trend of short skirts has been . popular for ages, with recent films like St Trinian's, and provocative . advertising campaigns making the style even more popular in recent . years. The typical fabric . used to make school skirts makes them very easy to adjust, with methods . of adjustment ranging from simple sewing techniques to rolling up the . skirts at the waist to make them shorter.","Diss High School called short skirts 'immodest' and 'impractical'

"Swings and slides are being removed from Britain's school playgrounds because of the massive rise in compensation claims when children suffer minor injuries. Claims have become so common that education authorities face mounting bills even when children get hurt while breaking school rules by climbing walls or trees. The compensation culture is being fuelled . by lawyers offering parents no-win no-fee deals, it is claimed, with some firms even . setting up telephone hotlines to encourage parents to sue. Compensation claims resulting from injuries in playgrounds have become so common that schools are removing their play equipment (file picture) Schools are often advised to settle out of court without contesting claims up to £12,000 just to save on legal costs. More than £4million was also paid out to staff last year. Jonathan Isaby, political director of the TaxPayers' Alliance, told the Sunday Express: 'There is no doubt that the compensation culture has got completely out of hand. People need to accept that sometimes accidents do happen and no one is to blame.' Figures revealed parents with pupils at schools in Lancashire have been paid almost £800,000 in compensation for their children's injuries in the past five years. The payouts include a child who got more than £15,000 after falling off a wall and another who collected £6,000 after cutting a leg while sliding down a banister. In Essex, school bosses have paid out . £227,137 in compensation and legal costs in the past five years. A child . who tripped down a step cost the council £30,544 and a pupil got . £24,650 after falling off a climbing frame. And in Kent, the county council has paid out £700,000 . in compensation to children injured in school accidents since 2008. The . biggest payout to a pupil was £80,000. Schools are often advised to settle out of court without contesting claims up to £12,000 just to save on legal costs. More than £4million was also paid out to staff last year . To win compensation an injured child has to prove there has been a breach of the duty of care owed to them by the school. If the child has suffered as a result of negligence they can claim compensation for their suffering and funding for any medical treatment. Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said: 'Schools become so risk-conscious they no longer present children with challenges and they are wrapped up in cotton wool.' The National Union of Teachers defended its members for seeking compensation saying many claims result from premises or equipment which have 'not been sufficiently well maintained'.","Kent County Council paid out £700,000 to children since 2008 .

"The third woman to accuse Bill Cosby of raping her as a teenager has said that she is speaking out so that people know he's not 'Mr. Clean'. Joan Tarshis, a former publicist, wrote an essay for Hollywood Elsewhere on Sunday accusing the entertainer of assaulting her on two occasions in 1969, when she was 19. Tarshis said that after it happened, she felt she couldn't speak out because of how others idolized him but that she is now stepping forward in light of accusations made by other women. 'I thought nobody would believe me because of his image, you know, whiter than snow,' she told The Wrap. Speaking out: Bill Cosby, pictured left on Monday, has been accused of rape by a third woman, Joan Tarshis (right), who said he attacked her twice in 1969 when she was working as a writer for him . In the piece for Hollywood Elsewhere, she explained that she had been in Los Angeles to write for comedian Godfrey Cambridge and she was introduced to Cosby by two women she was staying with. He invited her to have lunch with him at Universal Studios and 'seemed to take a liking' to her, she said. He invited her back a few times and always poured her strong drinks, she wrote. One day, he asked her to work on some material with him so she went to his bungalow, where he poured her a drink and she started talking about her ideas, she said. 'The next thing I remember was coming to on his couch while being undressed,' she wrote. 'Through the haze I thought I was being clever when I told him I had an infection and he would catch it and his wife would know he had sex with someone. 'But he just found another orifice to use. I was sickened by what was happening to me and shocked that this man I had idolized was now raping me. Of course I told no one.' 'Victim': Tarshis has claimed that Cosby gave her strong drinks that caused her to pass out and that she wake up naked. She said she felt that she could not speak out because of his 'whiter than snow' reputation . In November 2006, Bill Cosby settled a civil lawsuit with Andrea Constand, a former Temple University employee who claimed he had drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia-area mansion two years earlier. Her lawyers said they had the names of 13 other women who had come forward voluntarily with similar accounts of drugging or abuse at the hands of Cosby - but the settlement was reached before the other women could testify. Last month, Barbara Bowman revealed to MailOnline that she had been drugged and raped by Cosby in 1985, when she was a 17-year-old aspiring actress. She was one of the 13 women willing to support Constand in 2006. Joan Tarshis has become the latest woman to accuse him of raping her. On Sunday, she revealed she was working as a writer for Cosby in 1969, when he drugged and sexually abused her on two occasions, she said. Her mother was proud of her daughter's new connection and so when Cosby called to invite Tarshis to a theater production, she felt as if she had to go to the show, she said. She met him at his hotel, where she says his shaving kit was filled with bottles of pills, and then they went to the show together. In the car, he gave her a drink, she said. After the show, she was having difficulties standing up and asked the chauffeur to take her back home, she said. 'The next thing I remember was waking up in his bed back at the Sherry, naked,' she wrote. 'I remember thinking ""You old s***, I guess you got me this time, but it’s the last time you’ll ever see me"".' Afterwards, she said nothing for 20 years. 'During those years as I grew into adulthood, I watched Cosby be praised by everyone from Presidents to Oprah to the Jello Corporation,' she wrote. 'It all made me ill.' Speaking to Inside Edition, she explained she felt helpless. 'He’s too powerful,' she said. 'How can you stop him? I’m just a little person. What am I going to say? ""He raped me?"" Who is going to believe that?' Speaking to The Wrap after she wrote the piece, she said that she decided to speak out after other women came forward. MailOnline exclusively shared Barbara Bowman's story last month. 'All through the years, before I mentioned it, before anything else came out, I knew I wasn't the only person,' she said. 'That it wasn't just me... I knew that he was a serial rapist.' She said she hopes her claims go some way to affecting the public's view of him. Accusations: Last month, Barbara Bowman, who is pictured with an image of her teenage self, told MailOnline how she had been attacked by Cosby. Bowman's story gave Tarshis strength to speak out, she said . She also said she waited until now because she didn't want her parents to find out. Both are now in their 90s and the news won't reach them, she said. 'They would have really, really been damaged by me telling them something, or finding out something like this,' she said. Squeaky clean image: Tarshis said that she hated seeing Cosby on TV, knowing what he had done . Today, she continues to blame herself, she said. 'It still kind of feels that way, that I should have known better,' she said. 'I know intellectually that's incorrect, but that's still a feeling that I have.' Tarshis, who lives in upstate New York, became a music publicist in the 1980s and represented Bob Marley and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, among others. She later worked as a journalist and is now getting a master's in mental health counseling, the Wrap reported. The renewed attention on Cosby's past began last month when comedian Hannibal Buress assailed him during a stand-up performance in Philadelphia, Cosby's hometown, calling him a 'rapist'. His remarks were captured on video and posted online, gaining wide exposure. Adding to the growing firestorm: One of Cosby's accusers, Barbara Bowman, leveled allegations of sexual assault against him - first speaking to MailOnline last month and later in an online column for the Washington Post. She explained that in 1985, she was 17 and an aspiring actress when Cosby 'brainwashed me into viewing him as a father figure, and then assaulted me multiple times'. Cosby, who was never criminally charged in any case, settled a civil suit in 2006 with another woman over an alleged incident two years before. On Sunday, Cosby's lawyer said he will not dignify 'decade-old, discredited' claims of sexual abuse with a response. John P. Schmitt said the fact that the allegations are being repeated 'does not make them true.' Silence: Bill Cosby, pictured with his wife Camille on November 6, refused to answer questions about the allegations when the couple were being interviewed by NPR this weekend . Support: Legendary saxophonist Tony Williams, pictured front with Cosby, has stood up for his long-time friend, saying that he believes that the alleged victims are going after the comedian's fame and fortune . 'He would like to thank all his fans for the outpouring of support and assure them that, at age 77, he is doing his best work,' Schmitt said. Also at the weekend, Cosby stonewalled National Public Radio host Scott Simon during an interview with Cosby and his wife, Camille, about their African-American art collection. Cosby fell silent when asked by Simon about 'serious allegations raised about you in recent days'. 'You're shaking your head, no,' the host said. 'Do you have any response to those charges? Shaking your head, no.' Legendary saxophonist, Tony Williams, has also defended his friend, saying he is angry that the claims have resurfaced again and believes the women are just after Cosby's fame and money. 'No, No. He don't have to rape anybody,' Williams told Fox Philly  29 in an interview on Sunday.","Joan Tarshis, a former publicist, described 'the assaults' publicly for the first time on Sunday in an essay for Hollywood Elsewhere .

"David Cameron should abolish corporation tax for small firms so they are better able to compete with large companies, Lord Saatchi has said. The former Tory chairman said the party should pledge to no longer charge the levy on firms with fewer than 50 employees. Lord Saatchi, who is chairman of the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS), has also called on the Conservatives to stop imposing capital gains tax on investors in small companies. The former Tory chairman said the party should pledge to no longer charge the levy on firms with fewer than 50 employees . The recommendations come in a report celebrating the 40th anniversary of the think tank co-founded by Baroness Thatcher. Lord Saatchi said getting rid of the £8billion annual corporation tax bill for small business would be a ‘call to arms’ for the Conservatives, which would bring a culture shift on the scale of Right to Buy in the 1980s. He said the policy would show ‘how the awesome power of taxation can be used to the benefit of everyone’ and allow small firms to ‘challenge cartel capitalism’. John Major and Lord Saatchi with Baroness Thatcher photographed in 2010 . Under the policy, millions of people would ‘enjoy the opportunity to say, “I am the captain of my ship”,’ he added. The . report to be published tomorrow will add: ‘By allowing profitable small . companies to retain more of their earnings it will become easier for . them to self-finance their own expansion.’ Lord Saatchi boasted that the removal of corporation tax for smaller firms would quicken the economic recovery. He told the Telegraph: ‘It’s worth remembering that the average UK company has five employees. The Policy, as I call it, would therefore abolish corporation tax for 90 per cent of UK companies, reduce the deficit faster than predicted by the Office for Budget Responsibility, expand employment faster than it predicts, increase competition, challenge cartel capitalism and let millions of people grow tall.’ In an . article for the newspaper, he said that Mrs Thatcher knew that big . companies posed as big a ‘threat to freedom’ as big government and that . competition made capitalism work. The . CPS report, entitled The Road from Serfdom, reports polls for the think . tank that show people have a distrust of big government, which Lord . Saatch argues is a ‘sorry outcome for all believers in free-market . capitalism’. Lord Saatchi said that socialism became unpopular and now capitalism has also become unpopular. He said that the tax system has been reduced from being a tool for ‘social engineering’ to being for ‘revenue generation’. He . added: ‘It is on a par, at least, with the NHS or the criminal justice . system in its impact on human lives, and its relationship between the . government and the people.’ Corporation tax is currently set at 20 per cent of profits for businesses with less than £300,000 profit. Maurice Saatchi co-founded the advertising agency Saatchi and Saatchi with his brother Charles. The firm was closely associated with Margaret Thatcher’s three successive election victories and famously came up with the ‘Labour Isn’t Working’ poster during the 1979 election campaign. He was co-chairman of the Conservative Party from 2003 until 2005. He stepped down from the role after the party lost the 2005, for which he was responsible for running its election campaign. Lord Saatchi was created a life peer in the House of Lords by the party in 1996 and under Iain Duncan Smith served as shadow Treasury spokesman in the upper house.","Pledge to no longer charge the levy on firms with fewer than 50 employees .

"Mars One is an ambitious plan by a Dutch entrepreneur to send people to Mars next decade and start building a colony there. The proposal has received fierce criticism for its lack of realistic goals, and now one study has dealt the team a crushing blow - by saying the colonists will begin dying in 68 days. Low air pressure, habitats at risk of explosion and a lack of spare parts are among the potentially fatal dangers that apparently await anyone who makes the inaugural trip. Scroll down for video . Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientists analysed the plan by Dutch company Mars One to create a colony on Mars by the next decade (illustrated). The researchers say it has a number of flaws and the proposal is doomed to failure including a risk of suffocation and starvation . The damning study was carried out by students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In their research they found a number of ‘failure conditions’ that would ultimately lead to the demise of the crew. ‘The first crew fatality would occur approximately 68 days into the mission,' the students write. First, the astronauts simply won’t have enough food. Based on Mars One’s mission plan, the students say the colonists would ultimately starve on Mars. 2018 - By this year Mars One wants to place a lander on Mars - the construction of which has not yet begun - to test landing technologies and also practice communicating with satellites in orbit. 2020 - This year Mars One plans to send a rover to the surface to find a suitable site for the future habitat. 2022-2023 - Mars One wants to send six SpaceX’s Dragon capsules - which SpaceX has yet to agree to – as the core habitable modules of the colony, connected with two inflatable units. 2024 - The first crew are taken to Mars on a hypothetical Mars Transit Vehicle - although no concrete plans are available for how this spacecraft would work. 2025 onwards - Additional crew habitat units are launched and added to the colony. Next, one of the goals of Mars One is to grow crops in some of the habitats on the red planet. But according to the students, this would create huge amounts of oxygen, in turn creating highly flammable environments. Oxygen would need to be vented while nitrogen levels would need to be maintained to keep up the air pressure; however, the technology to do this on another planet has not yet been invented. ‘Our habitation simulations revealed that crop growth, if large enough to provide 100 per cent of the settlement’s food, will produce unsafe oxygen levels in the habitat,' the researchers write. 'As a result, some form of oxygen removal system is required - a technology that has not yet been developed for spaceflight.’ Humidity within these modules would also likely be around 100 per cent - something that is not fatal, but certainly uncomfortable for the astronauts. They also say that spare and replacement parts will be greatly needed but, owing to the nine-month or so trip time from Earth to Mars, these will be hard to come by. First the scientists say that the astronauts will not have enough food and will starve. Plants will also produce too much oxygen in their habitats (illustrated) - causing suffocation and also posing a significant risk of explosions. There will also not be enough spare parts to keep the colony maintained . The researchers also say that spare and replacement parts will be greatly needed by frequent resupply missions to the red planet (illustrated) but, owing to the nine-month or so trip time from Earth to Mars, these will be hard to come by . ‘After 130 months on the Martian surface, spare parts compose 62 per cent of the mass transported to the Martian surface,' they write. And finally, they point out that even getting all the necessary equipment to Mars will require 15 launches of Space X’s upcoming super-rocket, the Falcon Heavy, at a cost of £2.8 billion ($4.5 billion). SpaceX are yet to fly this rocket, making the plans to use 15 of them before the launch vehicle has even been tested somewhat ambitious. The paper does offer at least one suggestion to ensure the long-term survival of the crew, though. They say a separate structure could be used to grow food and also store excess oxygen, dishing out only what is need to the modules inhabited by the colonists. Using separate modules to store plants and excess oxygen could make the crewed modules more habitable (illustrated), but this doesn't solve many of the other problems for the mission including a lack of replacement parts and a lack of technology necessary to make it feasibile . The researchers also point out that even getting all the necessary equipment to Mars (shown) will require 15 launches of Space X’s upcoming super-rocket, the Falcon Heavy, at a cost of £2.8 billion ($4.5 billion). ‘The first crew fatality would occur approximately 68 days into the mission,' the students write . Responding to the comments, Mars One CEO Bas Lansdorp told Popular Science that he thinks the findings are incorrect. ‘I've talked to very knowledgeable people - experts with companies like Lockheed Martin - who tell me these technologies will work,’ he said. However, he admits that some aspects including a lack of resupplies could be a problem. ‘The major challenge of Mars One is keeping everything up and running,’ he added. ‘We don't believe what we have designed is the best solution. It's a good solution.'","Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientists analysed Mars One's plan to create a colony on Mars by the next decade .

"Wine connoisseurs may be prepared to pay hundreds of pounds for rare bottles stowed in French chateaus for decades, but for most people supermarket plonk has to do. Now there’s a gadget that claims to make cheap wine taste better, by accelerating the ageing process using high frequency sound waves. The Sonic Decanter, which is yet to be launched, will use ultrasound to 'age' bargain bottles in just 20 minutes by altering the compounds in the wine and make it more drinkable. Scroll down for video . A good vintage? The Sonic Decanter (pictured) claims to make cheap wine taste better, by accelerating the ageing process using high frequency sound waves . Its Seattle, Washington-based makers say the high frequency sound waves improve flavour by breaking down preservatives, softening tannins and releasing aromas not normally found in young wine. The gadget relies on patented technology that uses ultrasound to change the molecular and chemical structure of wine to make it taste smoother and more intense. Usually such an ageing process takes years for molecules to change due to the interaction between each other, but ultrasound forces these reactions to happen faster, changing their properties and the taste of the wine. The Sonic Decanter, which has yet to be launched, will use ultrasound to 'age' bargain bottles in just 20 minutes by altering the compounds in the wine to make it more drinkable . To use the gadget, people will have to pour water into the base then place a bottle of wine inside it. They will then press a button on the gadget - or a smartphone app - to say whether the wine if white, red or rose. They can choose a suitable time to 'age' the wine by setting the timer. The device takes 20 minutes or less to change the molecular and chemical structure of wine, using ultrasound. This will bring out aromas usually only associated with vintage wines, soften tannins and enhance the wine's flavour, the company claims. The company writes on its Kickstarter page: ‘When used on wine the [ultrasound] Sonic Decanter promotes further extraction of flavours, aromas and mouth feel from interactions among phenolics and anthocyanins (types of additives and pigments) and which results in smoother more integrated mouth feel and a smooth, flavourful lingering finish. ‘ . The device allows for a more energetic reaction between the molecules and therefore a more complete molecular change, it explained. Natural gases such as oxygen and sulphur dioxide are expelled from the bottle, giving it a longer shelf life. ‘This results in an improvement in taste, aroma, mouth feel and an overall enjoyment in the wine drinking experience,’ the company claims. Users of the gadget will be able to operate it using a smartphone app and Bluetooth connection, as well as buttons on the gadget, so they can run the device for a specific time to create a wine that suits their palette. The Sonic Decanter will ‘age’ a rose, Sauvignon Blanc or Chardonnay for around 10 minutes, to release extra flavours, while Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah can take twice that long. It can also be used to ‘reinvigorate’ previously opened and re-corked bottles of wine, its inventors say. The launch of the Sonic Decanter is planned for June next year and it's available to pre-order on Kickstarter from $129 (£82). The gadget relies on patented technology that uses ultrasound to change the molecular and chemical structure of wine.

"A Florida woman today described the horrific moment she heard a black bear's jaw clamp down on her head after she was attacked in her own garage over the weekend. Terri Frana, 44, had 30 staples in her scalp and 10 stitches to her forehead after she ran into five bears outside her Lake Mary home on Saturday night. The terrified mother said that the bears reacted too fast for her when she stepped outside and as she was mauled she pleaded for help, screaming, 'Please, my kids need me.' Scroll Down for Videos . Scary: Terri Frana broke down in tears during an interview describing her bear attack . Jaws: The mother showed the cameras how the bear launched its jaws around her head and clamped them down . Frana, told NBC's Today show that the frightening encounter has left her very shaken. 'I can't close my eyes and not think about it, see it, feel it, but that will go away in time and I'm here,’ said Frana. 'I'm here for my kids.' Frana said she stepped outside to get her children, who had been playing on their bikes when she was charged by the bears. 'I saw this large bear charging at me,’ she said to the Today show. 'She opened her jaw and clamped down onto my head, and I could just hear her teeth marks going through my scalp.' Clamped: Frana needed staples to her head after she was attacked by a bear outside her own home on Saturday . Wounds: Frana showed the cameras how lucky she was to escape crippling injury after the bear mauling on Saturday . Frana revealed she could only think about her family during the bloody attack. 'I said, ‘Please, my kids need me,' she recalled. Amazingly, Frana managed to escape the attack and drag herself inside her home where she was found by her eldest son, Drew, 15, who called 911. Despite living in the neighborhood for 10 years, Frana feels that she and her family obviously became complacent about the threat posed by black bears. 'Unfortunately, we just got too comfortable with them being around,’ she said. Indeed, the number of reports of people coming into contact with black bears in central Florida have more than doubled from just under a thousand in 2009 to more than 2,200 last year. Frana's husband, Frank, said that he was just lucky to still have his wife with him after the attack. 'One of the bears stood up, knocked her . down and started to maul her,' Frank Frana, the woman's husband, said according to MyFoxOrlando.com. 'The bear actually had my wife's head in its mouth and started to drag . her towards the woods.' Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy . Frank Frana talks to the media on outside the Lake Mary, Florida home along with his son . Mrs. Frana was mauled and clawed but managed to escape, running back into her house to get her husband. They called 911 and she was taken to hospital with wounds to her head, face, legs and torso. The attack in Lake Mary, Florida, just north of Orlando, happened just 10 miles from another bear mauling where a woman was . jumped upon whilst walking her dogs home. Officials say the mother of four . received bite marks to her shoulders, arms and upper thigh. Doctors also . placed some 30 staples in her head and 10 stitches to cover up other . lacerations. The attack happened inside the Carisbrooke subdivision at a home on Brackenhurst Place on Saturday night. The house in Lake Mary, Florida where a woman was mauled by a black bear is pictured . Seminole County Sheriff Lt. Pete . Brenenstuhl said that the woman was set . upon by five bears ‘of various sizes’, suggesting it was a family of the . animals. He said the bears pounced on her the moment they saw her and ‘dragged her from inside the garage out into her driveway’. Florida Fish and Wildlife officials are looking for the 200-pound black bear who attacked Mrs. Frana. Several traps have been placed in the neighborhood in hopes of catching the bear. Wildlife officials are also out with tranquilizers, but say most bears are trapped at night. On Sunday, officials shot a bear that was aggressive toward them in the area where the attack happened, Bay News9 reported. They shot the bear at close range because it came up to them. Three other bears were captured and euthanized, while two more ran away. Wildlife . officials said that at this time of year bears were more likely to be . scavenging for food and that residents should be on the lookout. In December, Susan Chalfant suffered . serious head injuries after a bear ‘came out of nowhere’ and jumped on . her as she walked with her dogs in Longwood. The Florida woman was set upon by five bears (this image is stock) as she went to check on her trash . It was the worst bear attack ever . recorded in Florida and left the 54-year-old covered in blood and with . facial injuries that were so bad a neighbor hardly recognised her. She later told wildlife investigators: ‘That bear was trying to kill me. It just kept coming’. In . January two Scottish tourists were attacked by a bear whilst on holiday . in California after they walked straight past the animal oblivious to . its presence. Bob and . Irene McKeown did not see the black bear as they exited their daughter’s . house even though it was just 10ft away from them. It followed them to their car where it clawed Mr McKeown who had just put his wife in the vehicle. Wildlife officials said that the animal could have been looking for food. Urban sprawl has meant that towns are taking up ever more of the land where bears live - and their numbers are increasing too. In the 1970s an estimated 300 wild black bears were in Florida but that number stood at 3,000 in 2002, the most recent survey. Researchers believe there could be as many as 5,000 now.

"The study also found that 88 per cent of billionaires graduated from college - but dropping out of Harvard didn't stop Mark Zuckerberg making his fortune . The success of billionaires may be down to more than just hard work and good luck - they may also be smarter than most, according to a study. About 45 per cent of billionaires are in the top one per cent for brainpower, says Jonathan Wai of Duke University. He says that the top one per cent of wealthy people and the top one per cent for brainpower strongly overlap, reports CNBC. That ranks them as smarter than US senators and federal judges, of whom 41 per cent are in the top one per cent for cognitive ability, and Fortune 500 CEOS at 38.6 per cent. Only 21 per cent of the US House of Representatives were considered to be that smart. However, the study only judges brainpower by whether someone attended one of 29 elite - and often expensive - American colleges, using the colleges' admissions criteria of high academic grades to decide if someone is intelligent. The study found that 88 per cent of billionaires graduated from college, though a lack of degree did not get in the way of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg making his billions after dropping out of Harvard. Among members of the Forbes 400 list of America's wealthiest people, Charles and David Koch, co-owners of Koch industries, took degrees at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology while investor Warren Buffett graduated from UPenn and Columbia.

"Some children are simply too naughty to fit into everyday school life, the Government’s behaviour tsar suggested today. There is a group of youngsters who behave in very difficult and violent ways and who need much more help and support, according to Charlie Taylor. He indicated that there may be have been a rise in these types of pupils, many of whom display very bad behaviour from an early age. Unable to mix: Charlie Taylor said there is a group of youngsters who are simply too naughty to fit into everyday school life (picture posed by model) Giving evidence to the Commons education select committee this morning, Mr Taylor - former headteacher of The Willows, a special school in west London for children with behavioural, emotional and social difficulties - said that while behaviour in general is improving, there remains a groups of children that persistently behave poorly. He was asked by Neil Carmichael, Conservative MP for Stroud, why it was that increasing numbers of pupils are suspended from school for abuse or assault and, at the same time, Ofsted rates almost four-fifths of schools as good for behaviour. Worrying: Mr Taylor said there may be have been a rise in these types of pupils, many of whom display very bad behaviour from an early age . Mr Taylor replied that the numbers of schools rated as good has fallen from around 87 per cent as the bar has been raised on standards of behaviour. He told the committee: 'Though I would say generally, the trajectory of behaviour within schools is improving' It is now rarer in schools to have 'no-go areas where teachers fear to tread at lunchtimes and break times', Mr Taylor said. 'So things have improved. 'But . I do think there’s a group of children who show very extreme behaviour, . very difficult, challenging, violent behaviour, often quite young . children, and I would say possibly there has been an increase in those . sorts of children. 'You can . still be a school who is good on behaviour and still have pupils like . that within your school because you’re doing a good job with them. 'But . nevertheless there are certainly a group of children who need extra . interventions, who need more help, who need more support and for whom . the basic standards of just a really well-run school aren’t enough.' He added: 'The trajectory is in the right direction, but there’s a huge amount to carry on doing.' Mr Taylor has just been appointed the first chief executive of the Teaching Agency, which will oversee teacher training. Mr Taylor said that he had concerns that some training courses are not teaching would-be teachers enough about behaviour and how to deal with it. Behaviour expert: Charlie Taylor was the headteacher of The Willows, a special school in west London for children with behavioural, emotional and social difficulties, before his government appointment . 'Sometimes behaviour gets pigeon-holed . as a one off lecture at the beginning of the year,' he said, with a . lecturer handing out tips on how to deal with misbehaving pupils. Mr . Taylor has previously called for disruptive children to be identified . before they start school to stop them going 'off the rails' later on. Publishing . his report into alternative provision earlier this year, Mr Taylor said . that intervening to help naughty children when they are as young as two . or three is better than 'waiting until they are throwing tables . around'. Teaching unions . have previously raised concerns about misbehaving pupils, with a survey . by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) suggesting that poor . parenting could be fuelling bad behaviour in schools. It revealed that behaviour has worsened in the last five years, with pupils kicking, punching, pushing and shoving school staff. ATL general secretary Dr Mary Bousted said there is a minority of children who have a 'total disregard of school rules'. These youngsters are just as likely to be 'over-indulged' middle-class children as those from poorer homes, she said. Ofsted chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw has also warned that schools are often forced to act as 'surrogate parents' in a sometimes self-obsessed culture that fails to instil good values in children.","Charlie Taylor said cases difficult and violent pupils are on the rise .

"Legal dispute: Chef Gordon Ramsay is suing the businessman he ran his Fat Cow restaurant with . Chef Gordon Ramsay is suing the businessman he ran his Fat Cow restaurant with to force him to share the legal costs of a lease dispute. Fiery cook Ramsay is being sued by the landlord of the Los-Angeles-based eatery for a sum believed to be in the region of $6million dollars. It’s claimed that Mr Ramsay was in breach of contract on a long-term lease at the Grove Shopping center by shutting the Fat Cow down earlier in 2014. Now Ramsay is pursuing his ex-partner Rowen Seibel, saying that they’d agreed when they opened the restaurant in 2012 to share the costs of any lawsuits that might arise over the lease, according to TMZ. It added that Ramsay also wants Mr Seibel to contribute to half the bill should they lose the case. MailOnline has yet to receive a response from Mr Ramsay's representatives after a request for comment. Earlier this year, Ramsay was accused of running the Fat Cow as a 'dictatorship', by Seibel. He claimed in a New York civil suit that the cook made business decisions and ruled the burger joint with an iron fist, mimicking his demanding persona on the TV series Hell's Kitchen. Seibel claims Ramsay 'secretly shut down' The Fat Cow before re-opening on his own under the name GR Roast, in a $10.8 million suit rubbished by Ramsay's people as 'ridiculous'. And Siebel claims Ramsay assured him he would take care of a trademark problem surrounding Las Vacas Gordas, a Spanish restaurant in Florida who had registered The Fat Cow, alleging the chef told him: 'I am the trademark queen'. 'Ramsay attempted to run the business and make decisions on behalf of (his partners) similar to his television personality on Hell's Kitchen — as a dictatorship,' Seibel claims in court papers via his lawyer Paul Sweeney. 'Instead, in a dramatic money grab and breach of his fiduciary obligation to Seibel, Fat Cow LLC and FCLA, Gordon Ramsay began taking steps to secretly shut down Fat Cow Restaurant, using the trademark issue as his straw man excuse, and open a new restaurant at the premises without Seibel.' Earlier this year, Ramsay was accused of running the Fat Cow as a 'dictatorship', by his ex-business partner . Ramsay was sued by The Fat Cow staff members in a class action last year . Seibel invested $800,000 in The Fat Cow, but is not involved in Ramsay's new venture, where he will also film his reality TV series, Page Six reports. 'We're surprised that Mr Seibel has the audacity to file this ridiculous suit when he and his team were responsible for the day to day running of The Fat Cow and spectacularly mismanaged it resulting in a string of financial and legal issues,' a spokesman for Ramsay told MailOnline. 'Gordon Ramsay and his team immediately stepped in and tried to resolve these issues, but Seibel refused to engage in any meaningful conversations, rendering the restaurant unsustainable. 'Throughout, Ramsay was very forthcoming with Seibel that any future plan for another restaurant partnership in Los Angeles was impossible due to Seibel's refusal to operate and fund the restaurant properly.' Ramsay was sued by The Fat Cow staff members in a class action last year, where it was alleged they were paid below minimum wage and not given proper breaks.","Gordon Ramsay is suing ex-business partner Rowen Seibel for $300k .

Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia was reported missing on January 10, 2013 and found the next day dead inside a rolled-up gym mat at Lowndes High School. Police interviewed some of the former wrestler's fellow teammates as his parents call into question the alibi of one student. CNN reports that the student, who has not been named, confronted Johnson and told him 'it ain't over' after an incident between Johnson and the younger brother of the former student. While he was said to have been at a wrestling match at another school at the time of Johnson's death, lawyers are now saying the bus had not left yet at the time of Johnson's death. Kendrick Johnson's parents, maintain that their son's death was not an accident. They have filed a $100 million lawsuit alleging his classmates beat him to death- naming 37 people, including local law enforcement, plus the city of Valdosta as defendants.

Strange circumstance: Johnson was found dead inside a rolled-up gym mat (above) in January of 2013 . According to CNN, attorney Chevene King said the Johnsons have been kept in the dark about events regarding their son's death at the South Georgia high school. In footage posted on YouTube authorities arrested several family members who held hands, blocking a door to the courthouse. Meanwhile, another video posted to a Kendrick Johnson tribute page on Facebook shows family members later, inside the courthouse, joining hands in front of the checkpoint. The family and others can be heard chanting, 'No justice, no peace,' as officers step in to arrest them. The relatives, who call themselves the 'KJ 7,' were arrested and released on bond in the April 25, 2013, incident, King said. Shortly after her release, Jacquelyn Johnson told WCTV, 'I'm going to be right back out at the courthouse in the morning, ready to do it all over again, until we get justice.' But in a twist of fate, each of the seven family members could now face up to a year in prison, and a $1,000 fine.

"A vast ocean graveyard of British and German vessels sunk during the First World War has been discovered by a team of explorers. A total of 41 German U-boats, as well as three English submarines, have been unearthed at depths of up to 50 feet close to England’s southern and eastern coasts by a team led by underwater archaeologist Mark Dunkley. The find is expected to clear up a number of mysteries about the fates of ships that sank fighting in the conflict. 41 German submarines from the First World War have been discovered off the UK coast. Pictured, a U-boat stranded on the south coast of England in 1917 . The discoveries could bring to light the fate of a number of vessels which disappeared. Two German submarines, the U35 and U42 (pictured), surface off the Mediterranean coast . Mr Dunkley, who is is employed by English Heritage, said: 'We owe it to these people to tell their story. 'We divers only approach the boats with great caution. Venturing inside would definitely be extremely dangerous.' He says his team will now to use robots to cut through the hull to find the mysteries that lie within. 'Perhaps we'll find a cup or a sign with a name on it,' Dunkley told reports German news magazine Der Spiegel. Several U-boats with the German . Imperial Navy are still officially considered missing to this day. Lists . provide details on which of the U-boats the German naval forces . had lost by the time the war ended in November 1918, but the fate of . many is still shrouded in mystery. German U-Boat U-118 attracts the attention of locals after washing up on the beach at Hastings, 1919. The ships were labelled 'baby killers' by British propagandists . One such mysterious vessel is UB 17, which vanished with its crew of 21 men. Another is the UC 21, commanded by naval Lieutenant Werner von Zerboni di Sposetti, a minelayer that disappeared with all 27 hands. Dunkley believes he has found both. He know hopes to find memorabilia that will give a clue to the identity of those who died in what were undoubtedly horrendous and terrifying circumstances. The Germans used the submarines to inflict heavy losses on merchant shipping in the Great War. They only had 28 of the relatively new U-boats at the beginning of the war, but as the technology proved its effectiveness production was ramped up significantly. 'Many have forgotten how successful the German U-boat fleet was for a time,' added Dunkley. However, the risks to the crew were enormous. Torpedoes often misfired, killing crew, and aiming them was a difficult and uncertain process. If they missed, the slow-moving vessels were easy prey for warships, which would ram them or use depth charges. Nearly half of the 380 U-boats used by the German navy in World War I were lost.","Vessels discovered near south and east coasts .

But it seems Nasa has itself captured something very strange on camera, including a strange white light dancing across the horizon of the red planet, and four blobs hovering in the sky . While the images are certainly a curiosity, Nasa and photography experts insist that these are nothing more than blemishes on the images, picked up by the camera lens sitting on the rover at a distance of 350 million miles away. So what are the Mars anomalies? View the videos below: . 1) Some internet users claim to be able to see a speck of light rapidly traversing the Martian horizon n the images below . 2) It may not look like much, but on the dry and barren Mars landscape, any movement is unexpected - and some claim to be able to see a light which apparently lifts itself off the ground below . 3) On some returned images from the Curiosity, strange pinpoints appear in the . sky - are they spaceships, or just abnormalities on the camera? The Martian landscape: But what is that hovering over the background? Dots appear to float in the sky, leading some observers to suggest an alien presence . An inverse colour image shows the 'UFO's in sharper detail: Experts say these are 'dead pixels' on the camera - others are not so sure . So far, Nasa has not commented on any of the strange sightings, but alien hunters have suggested these are alien ships monitoring our baby steps into the universe. YouTube user StephenHannardADGUK, . part of a group called Alien Disclosure UK, spotted the anomalies on the . NASA images, publicly available on the space agency's website, and . applied a series of filters to try to shed light on the mystery. Referring to the four pin-points of light pictured in the skies of Mars (below), he . said: 'Four objects caught by Mars Curiosity, very difficult to make . out on original image so I have used a few filters to highlight. 'What are these four objects? UFOs, Dust particles, or something else? As always you decide.' However video analyst . Marc Dantonio - who, in the interests of full disclosure, has worked on . projects for the U.S. government - told the Huffington Post that these . are simply 'dead pixels' in the image - a regular problem in the world . of graphics. Indeed, many computers and mobile phones develop dead pixel problems, as do modern digital camera. Dantonio said: 'After watching the video, it is actually quite clear that these are one-pixel sized image anomalies. 'I fully concur at this point that these are dead pixels on the imager. 'All . CCD [cameras] have them, and in a bland atmosphere like that at Mars, . they would be very obvious as opposed to an active atmosphere like . Earth, where they could end up hidden for a long time before anyone . noticed them.' Another video appears to show an object rising from the horizon, followed shortly afterwards by another small object. NASA has not publicly commented on either 'sighting'. Curiosity, a six-wheeled vehicle the . size of a compact car, landed inside a vast, ancient impact crater near . Mars' equator on August 6 after an eight-month, 354-million-mile voyage . through space. Earlier . today, the rover was seen wiggling its wheels back and fourth during . final checks before it sets off across the surface of Mars. Engineers . at mission control have been running a series of tests before the . one-ton vehicle's first drive which is expected in the next couple of . days. The Martian motor was . also shown flexing its extending robotic arm for the first time. The . 7-foot-long (2.1-meter-long) arm maneuvers a turret of tools including a . camera, a drill, a spectrometer, a scoop and mechanisms for sieving and . portioning samples of powdered rock and soil. The . Mars rover Curiosity zapped its first rock on Sunday with a . high-powered laser gun designed to analyze Martian mineral content, and . scientists declared their target practice a success. The . robotic science lab aimed its laser beam at the fist-sized stone nearby . and shot the rock with 30 pulses over a 10-second period, NASA said in a . statement issued from mission control at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory . near Los Angeles. The strange shimmering lights seen by Curiosity: . The original image from the NASA website: The 'UFOs' are faint in this image, but observable through adjusting the contrast and brightness . The YouTube video - posted by a Stephen Hannard - puts the photograph through many different filters to try to find more clues as to their existence.

"A secret training manual for reveals that Apple's 'geniuses' are banned from saying words that will alarm customers like 'crash' and 'bug' and they're schooled in watching body language to understand what they need to do to make a sale. What the Genius Training Student Workbook teaches Apple employees goes far beyond the old adage of 'the customer is always right.' The latest version of the book, which has been obtained by Gizmodo, details the ways workers are taught to act and speak when faced with patrons. Best of the best? Apple is highly regarded for its customer service record . This isn't just technical training; it's human conditioning. Whatever psychological judo Apple . geniuses are taught seems to be working. Apple stores have the highest . sales per square foot of any retail space in the country -- by a wide . margin. And profits have increased five-fold in the past five years -- totaling more than $3.1billion last year. While there are rarely complaints about one’s experience at an Apple store, the employees are urged to exhibit much more than expertise and good customer service. Record: While there are rarely complaints about one's experience at an Apple store, the employees are urged to exhibit much more than expertise and good customer service . In fact, the workbook includes a list of terms that Apple genius bar employees are forbidden to say to customers. Among them are 'bug,' 'crash,' 'incompatible' and 'problem.' Instead, terms like 'condition,' 'does not respond,' 'does not work' and 'issue' are preferable. In fact, full chapters are dedicated to detecting their moods through body language, how to serve a customer through empathy and how to read their body language. Apple's Genius Training Student Workbook offers a list of words sales employees are never supposed to use -- either because they're bad for the pro-sales vibe or because Apple's legal department has deemed them liabilities. 'Get to Yes by avoiding Negatives,' the handbook admonishes. Here's a partial list: . According to Gizmodo, the Apple sales . model is summed up in the letters that make up the company name: . (A)pproach, (P)robe, (P)resent, (L)isten, (E)nd. The manual lets its employees know . that the company’s employees ‘deepens and restore relationships, help . [customers] discover and enrich their lives.' Any forceful behaviour on a salesperson’s part is strongly prohibited. Another page in the book lists a number of body language actions, split into whether they are 'positive' or 'negative.' Silent talking: The leaked handbook also details how Apple employees read customer body language during interactions . Among the physiological training Apple store employee receive is a crash-course in reading body language. Make not mistake: Apple employees are watching your every move for hints about how you're feeling and what they need to do to make the sale. Cooperation: Sitting on edge of chair, hand-on-face gestures, unbuttoned coat, head tilted . Expectancy: Hand-rubbing, crossed fingers . Evaluation: Hand-to-cheek gestures, head tilted, stroking chin, gestures with glasses, pacing . Acceptance: Hand-to-chest, touching, moving in closer . Confidence: Steepling hands, hands joined at back . Frustration: Short breaths, 'Tsk!', tightly clenched hands, wringing hands, fist-like gestures, pointing index finger, palm to back of neck, kicking ground or imaginary object . Boredom: Drumming on table, head in hand, blank stare . Suspicion and secretiveness: Sideways glance, feet or body pointing towards the door, rubbing nose, rubbing eye . Nervousness: Clearing throat . For example, 'touching' and ‘moving in closer' indicate acceptance, while 'fist-like gestures' and 'pointing index finger' are listed as acts of frustration. Another strange aspect of the training manual is the the section called 'Fearless Feedback.' It encourages Apple store employees to critique each other on how well they're adhering to the rigorous Apple-speak and policies presented in Apple training. The manual provides several sample 'conversation' between two geniuses. 'Hi, fellow Genius. I overheard your conversation with your customer . during the last interaction and I have some feedback if you have a . moment. Is this a good time?' 'Yes, this is a good time.' 'You . did a great job resolving the customer's iPhone issue. I was concerned . with how quickly you spoke to the customer. It seemed like you were . rushing through the interaction, and the customer had additional . questions.' Former Apple store employees scoffed at the 'Fearless Feedback' section, saying it's proof that the company is trying to train its sales force to behave like empathetic robots. 'Fearless Feedback was really hated around the place. If someone had Fearless Feedback, we'd listen, but then afterwards I'd have this uncontrollable urge to punch them in the face,' one former genius told Gizmodo. On its website, Apple calls the genius bar 'the best place to get support for Apple products.' Apple believes its training for genius bar employees is so good, the company is using them to promote their products. A new series of commercials features an Apple genius helping to sold the world's technology-related problems with a cheerful smile and seemingly infinite knowledge. Three commercials debuted during the London Olympic games. The ads seem to have backfired, though. Many viewers have called the genius character smug and slammed the company for painting customers and witless dolts. Versions of all three commercials posted on YouTube have received overwhelmingly negative votes.","Booked leaked by Gizmodo tells how Apple employees are taught to act and speak when dealing with customers .

"Chipotle customers are up in arms since it was revealed that the Mexican fast food restaurant has been rounding up bills to the nearest nickel in high-volume locations like New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts. Outraged, they demanded answers from the company as to why they are nicking pennies from their loyal customers and why the prevalent practice is not indicated anywhere near the registers. Chipotle defended itself saying that the registers rounds up, or down, in order to be more efficient and speed up long lines, adding that they don't make any profit off the practice. Overcharge: Chipotle customers are up in arms since it we revealed that Mexican fast food restaurant has been rounding up bills to the nearest nickel in high-volume locations like New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts . Jayson Greenberg notified the Star Ledger about the strange pattern he'd been noticing on his receipts. 'The receipts at the Chipotle in West Caldwell don’t add up when there are odd amounts involved,' he told the paper. He shared several receipts with the paper, showing how the company was adding 'rounding' charges to his bill. On July 13, he purchased $32.93 worth of food, with $2.31 worth of tax, but somehow it added up to $35.25, rather than $35.24. Another receipt showed a subtotal of $8.64 with a tax of $0.60, but the total was $9.25 rather than $9.24. He said it wasn't so much the pennies that bothered him, but the principle that the store was rounding up receipts, without telling their customers. Mr Greenberg asked the manager of his local Chipotle what had caused the confusion and he got a lackluster response. 'Oh, it’s a computer program. It is just rounding numbers. It takes a little from certain receipts and gives a little to others. What do you want? A few pennies?' the manager told him. Penny-Pincher: Outraged, they demanded answers from the company as to why they are nicking pennies from their loyal customers and why the prevalent practice is not indicated anywhere near the registers . Dinner: Chipotle defended itself saying that the rounds up, or down, to be more efficient and speed up long lines and that it does not make any money off the practice . After the paper inquired about the receipts, the restaurants started adding a 'rounding' line to all the receipts, indicating the peculiar practice. Chipotle defended the customer coin gouge, saying that after August 1, they would be up front about it. 'It is just rounding numbers. It takes a . little from certain receipts and gives a little to others. What do you . want? A few pennies?'Chipotle Manager . 'It’s something we do in some high volume markets, including New Jersey,' said spokesman Chris Arnold. 'The way it works is that prices auto-round to the nearest quarter and that’s indicated on the receipt. The idea is simply to limit the possible combinations of change on cash transactions to keep the lines moving quickly in high volume areas.' Furthermore, Chipotle has said it will no longer round up, only down. 'It was never our intention to have a policy that was confusing or misleading,' Mr Arnold said.","Chipotle restaurants routinely round up customer's bills to a nickel .
Previously, did not warn customers at the register .
After public investigation, now they will only round down ."
"Nokia as a brand might be down, but it's not out. The firm today gave internet users a hint of a new product that looks unlike a mobile phone - setting the inter alight with speculation over what it could be, from a TV set top box to take on the Apple TV and Amazon Fire, to a small computer. However, one thing it will not be is a mobile phone - as part of a recent deal with Microsoft, Nokia is not allowed to use its branding on phones until 2017 - but that means after this date, Nokia phones could also be resurrected. The firm today tweeted this mysterious image - . Following Microsoft's plans to ditch the Nokia brand across its smartphone range, the FFinnishfirm has unveiled plans to start licencing its name and expertise to other manufacturers, starting this quarter . Following Microsoft's plans to ditch the brand across its smartphone range, the Finnish firm also  unveiled a strategy to start licencing its name, expertise and technologies to other manufacturers, starting this quarter. Microsoft bought Nokia's phone business for £4.5bn ($7.2 bn) in April and announced it was dropping both the Nokia and Windows Phone brand names in October, in favour of just using Lumia. But, the Finnish firm will continue to trade as a separate company, focusing on mapping and network infrastructure. As part of the deal, Nokia is not allowed to use its own branding on smartphones until 2016, and on feature phones until 2024. The recent licencing plans were announced at the Nokia Capital Markets Day by president of Nokia Technologies, Ramzi Haidamus. Microsoft bought Nokia's phone business for £4.5bn ($7.2 bn) in April and announced it was dropping both the Nokia and Windows Phone brand names in October, in favour of just using Lumia. As part of the deal, Nokia is not allowed to use its branding on smartphones until 2016, and on feature phones until 2024 . He said: 'It is our goal to start licensing our brand in areas other than these two restricted areas, starting this quarter actually, in the areas we can and the areas where the brand is relevant.' Mr Haidamus did not go into detail what these areas are. It was a strategy used by Polaroid to bolster its failing brand over the past decade. Polaroid licenses its polarising technology to flat-screen TVs, for example, and its camera technology to tablets. Nokia Networks recently made a significant breakthrough in boosting battery life on phones, by increasing capacity by up to 49 per cent. The Finnish-based firm saw the results during its first live trial of a software known as High Speed Cell FACH on a 3G network. Nokia Networks has completed its first live testing of High Speed Cell FACH technology, with support from chip manufacturer Qualcomm. When using apps, phones send and receive small amounts of data, and Nokia's technology is designed to handle these so-called 'data packets' more efficiently. Nokia Networks recently made a significant breakthrough in boosting battery life on phones, by increasing capacity by up to 49 per cent. The Finnish-based firm saw the results during its first live trial of a software known as High Speed Cell FACH on a 3G network . This increases browsing speeds, power savings and response times . When running applications such as WhatsApp, Facebook, and Twitter, as well as browsing the web, sending emails and using services such as FaceTime, phones often send and receive small amounts of data, known as packets, of just a few hundreds of bytes or a few kbytes. High Speed Cell FACH is designed to handle these small data packets more efficiently than other software. This makes apps run faster, and also means they use less energy over the course of a day, for example. The technology additionally means operators can boost the speed and quality of their services, and support a higher number of phones on their networks. According to the recent Nokia tests, the 3G software boosts speeds and network response times by up to 65 per cent, and leads to up to 20 per cent faster browsing. Users also saw power savings of up to 49 per cent, which meant their battery life lasted almost twice as long - depending on which applications were being used. The lowest power saving was nine per cent. It also recently partnered with photography experts at C&A Marketing, which owns Ritz Camera stores and Calumet photography, to make Polaroid-branded cameras and accessories. After the restrictions on smartphone branding lifts, however, Nokia would be able to brand devices made by other manufacturers. These devices may also use technology being developed by Nokia's Network division.

'Some of today's press reports related to rumours about Microsoft dropping the Nokia brand have declared the death of the Nokia brand,' said Barry French, Executive Vice President, Marketing and Corporate Affairs. 'But, to paraphrase Mark Twain, ""reports of our death are an exaggeration."" 'Yes, we have sold our mobile phone business to Microsoft. But the Nokia of today is financially robust and has moved from weakness to strength. 'We have one of the world's best telecom infrastructure businesses, a global leader in the mapping and location business, a stellar intellectual property portfolio and some of the finest innovation capabilities of any company anywhere. 'Remember, Nokia started almost 150 years ago with just one paper mill. Over time we have repeatedly and successfully reinvented ourselves. 'We may not be the same Nokia of several years ago, but we are here, we are strong, and our brand is very much still alive. Not to mention kicking!' The recent name change by Microsoft brings an end to Nokia's brand being on mobile phones - a run that stretches back into the 1980s. It was first hinted at when Microsoft moved Nokia.com to be hosted on Microsoft's own site. Each country will gradually see branding changed from Nokia to Microsoft Lumia across various social media accounts, beginning with Nokia France. Nokia phones will likely elicit fond memories for many, though, with the Nokia 3310 in particular being one of the defining phones at the dawn of the cell phone age. First released towards the end of 2000, the phone went on to sell 126 million units world wide and continues to enjoy a cult status.

"Winston Churchill will be restored to the national curriculum as schools are ordered to teach children about Britain’s history. The national curriculum for history, to be published by Education Secretary Michael Gove next week, will give all children aged seven to 14 a clear narrative of the major events between the Bronze Age and the present day. The document, seen by the Mail, will state clearly that every pupil must ‘know and understand the history of these islands as a coherent, chronological narrative, from the earliest times to the present day’. British institutions: Figures such as Henry VIII and Winston Churchill will be reinstated onto the history syllabus, which will be published next week. British history will take a more prominent role on the curriculum . Mr Gove is insisting that pupils learn about leading historical figures such as Henry VIII, Elizabeth I, Oliver Cromwell and Queen Victoria. Pupils aged 11 to 14 will also be expected to study ‘the Second World War and the wartime leadership of Winston Churchill’, the only modern politician who is mentioned. He was banished from the curriculum in 1999. The current national curriculum, last updated by Labour in 2007, leaves big gaps in pupils’ knowledge and ditched the learning of significant dates and events in favour of focusing on historical themes. But the new curriculum makes British history the centrepiece of the curriculum, rather than, for example, the heavy emphasis on the Nazis. It also calls for pupils to study ‘how people’s lives have shaped this nation and how Britain has influenced and been influenced by the wider world’. That will involve study of . non-European subjects such as ancient China, India and Islamic . civilisation, rather than the primary focus being on European history as . at present. Earlier this . year, Mr Gove said he was worried that the curriculum and exams system . ‘mean that children thirsting to know more about our past leave school . woefully undernourished’. A . senior Whitehall source said: ‘Children will learn a coherent . chronological story of British history instead of Labour’s dumbed-down . curriculum that leaves pupils with big gaps in basic knowledge. They . will learn about major global phenomena such as classical Greece, the . Renaissance, and the Enlightenment, and about non-European civilisations . such as China.’ The . Education Secretary’s first attempt to rewrite the curriculum in . February was condemned as too prescriptive by Left-wing academics. He . has compromised by leaving teachers some freedom to decide precisely . what to teach. But he has stuck to his guns by ordering them to follow . clear chronology. Professor . Jeremy Black, the senior history professor at Exeter University, who . helped draw up the curriculum, said: ‘It is very important that we . understand our national history as part of being an active citizen. ‘You can’t debate our sense of national identity and our national interest unless you understand our national history. This curriculum puts British history first as well, which I think is right. ‘It kicks out the woolly empathy in favour of giving children more of a sense of where we are at that moment between the past and the future.’","New curriculum published next week will cover major events from the Bronze age to the present day .

"Experts have called for sugar-laden fizzy drinks to carry warning labels similar to those found on cigarette packets, in a bid to combat the adverse health effects. New York assemblyman Karim Camara has introduced a bill that will require health warning labels on certain drinks with added sugar. It comes after the World Health Organisation recommended slashing a person's daily intake of added sugar from 50g to 25g - or from 10 to five cubes a day. A regular can of Coke contains 35g of sugar, so that alone would exceed this limit. The size of the warning, said Mr Camara, should be dictated by the size of the drink. Sugar-laden fizzy drinks should carry warning labels to educate consumers that sugar causes obesity, diabetes and tooth decay, a New York politician claims . Should soda cans carry health warning labels like cigarette packets? Should soda cans carry health warning labels like cigarette packets? Now share your opinion . 'We can't sit back and pretend that sugary drinks aren't harmful to people,' he said. 'We have a public health crisis, which is a direct result of people consuming too much sugar. 'The research is clear: too much sugar leads to health problems such as obesity and diabetes. 'As a society, we have a moral obligation to educate people so they can make healthier choices.' The Brooklyn democrat said the labels should read: 'SAFETY WARNING: DRINKING BEVERAGES WITH ADDED SUGAR CONTRIBUTES TO OBESITY, DIABETES AND TOOTH DECAY.' Mr Camara was joined on the steps of City Hall by representatives from the American Heart Association, the American Diabetes Association and the Center for Science in the Public Interest. Past research has found sugary drinks are a primary contributor to type 2 diabetes, especially in children. In August, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that 40 per cent of children born between 2000 and 2011 would develop type 2 diabetes in their lifetime. Experts at the CDC estimate 35 per cent of Americans are obese, and 69 per cent are overweight. Obesity is known to cause other serious illnesses, including cancer, heart disease and stroke. Mr Camara said the aim of introducing warning labels on drinks is to educate the public, and lower the consumption of the drinks. He likened their goal to that of health campaigners who fought to include warning labels on cigarette packages. Brooklyn democrat Karim Camara has introduced a bill to include the warnings on all sugary drinks . 'This is about pragmatic legislation,' he said. 'This is not about an attack on an industry for the sake of the industry. 'This is about doing what's best for children and adults in our society. 'We cannot afford for our children to continue to be overweight, to continue to have learning problems, to have health problems that may lead to difficult lives and at times illnesses that can lead to the loss of life.' Mr Camara urged the beverage industry to support the bill after they spent $13million in New York State in 2010 to oppose a proposed penny-per-ounce sugary drink tax, arguing that education is what was really needed. Assemblyman Jeffrery Dinowitz, consumer affairs and protection chair, said: 'Studies have established a direct link between consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and rising rates of obesity, diabetes, and other major health problems in New York and across the United States, which cause thousands of deaths and cost billions of dollars in health care spending annually. 'We must do everything we can to make the public aware of the serious risks incurred by the over-consumption of sugar. 'Many years ago, when faced with a similarly devastating public health crisis, we chose to place warning labels on cigarettes and other tobacco products to allow citizens to make more informed choices about what they purchase. 'Given the scientific evidence of sugar's negative consequences for our society, is not only appropriate, but incumbent, upon us to use similar warning labels with sugar-sweetened beverages.' Nutrition policy consultant said warning labels are a 'smart way to educate consumers about the negative health impacts' of their favourite fizzy drinks. She said: 'Right now, the beverage industry bombards our kids with its own messages encouraging constant consumption. 'In 2010, for example, preschoolers viewed an average of 213 ads for sugary drinks and energy drinks, while children and teens watched an average of 277 and 406 ads, respectively.' Stephen Habbe, from the American Diabetes Association, said the type 2 epidemic in the U.S. has been 'in part, fuelled by the increased consumption of calorie-dense sugar-sweetened beverages'. He said nearly 30 million children and adults in the U.S. have diabetes, with more than 1.3million in New York diagnosed with the condition. The bill comes after the World Health Organisation recently recommended slashing a person's daily intake of added sugar from 50g to 25g - or from 10 to five cubes a day . Another 86 million Americans have pre-diabetes, putting them at risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Mr Habbe said: 'Diabetes kills tens of thousands of Americans every year and results in disabling complications for thousands of others. Earlier this year, the World Health Organisation published draft guidelines urging adults to eat no more than 12 teaspoons of sugar a day and to aim for six. The guideline amount slashed was amid fears sugar poses same threat as tobacco. The number of obese British adults is expected to double from one in four to one in two by 2050 – at a cost to the economy of £50billion a year. The WHO said the crisis was being fuelled by hidden sugar in processed food and drink such as yogurts, muesli, sauces, fizzy drinks, juice and smoothies. However, low-fat foods have also come under fire from experts, after it was revealed they often contain more sugar than the full-fat alternative. WHO also said children should try for less than six teaspoons and avoid cans of fizzy drink such as Coke, which contains seven spoons. Instead five or six teaspoons is the ideal figure that people should aim for. 'The American Diabetes Association supports reducing the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages through public information, education, and health policy, and applauds Assemblyman Camara for his interest in warning labels for sugar-sweetened beverages.' And the American Heart Association echoed Mr Habbe's backing of the bill. Robin Vitale said: 'There is no doubt that consumption of sugary drinks has increased dramatically in recent decades. 'It is important for our government leaders to work with the public health community to identify, test and implement effective evidence-based strategies to help reverse this dangerous trend. 'The American Heart Association supports a comprehensive, multi-pronged approach to combatting obesity which is a leading cause of heart disease and stroke. 'We are very interested in the proposed legislation by Assembly Member Camara as part of a broad range of public policy approaches addressing the consumption of sugary drinks.' The American Beverage Association told the New York Observer, warning labels will not change consumer behaviour. Spokesman Christopher Grindlesperger, said: 'Obesity is a serious and complex issue, but a misleading warning label on certain beverages will not change behaviors or teach people about healthy lifestyles. 'There's a better way to empower consumers to make the choices that are right for them. 'If we want to get serious about obesity, it starts with education – not laws and regulation.'","New York politician Karim Camara has introduced a bill that will require health warning labels on certain drinks with added sugar .

During the Vogue interview Cara also opened up about her much talked about campaign with fellow supermodel Kate Moss, 40, who she is often compared to. The pair appear together in Burberry's latest fragrance campaign dressed in just the brand's iconic trench coats. Cara said of the campaign: 'The shoot with Kate has to be one of my favourites. It was relaxed and easy and really was us being us, which meant Mario was able to get some amazing natural shots.' Cara described the sultry black and white campaign for Burberry as one of her favourites ever . Starring in campaigns like YSL's latest beauty ad has helped Cara earn over £2 million this year .

"Victim: Dr Martin Salia, who contracted Ebola while working in Sierra Leone, has died two days after being flown to Nebraska for treatment . The surgeon who was flown back to the United States this weekend after contracting Ebola working in Sierra Leone has died, the University of Nebraska Medical Center announced. Dr Martin Salia was diagnosed with the deadly virus on November 10 and arrived in Omaha for care on Saturday, where doctors described the 44-year-old as 'extremely ill' and in perhaps worse condition than any other Ebola patient treated in the U.S. By Sunday the Sierra Leone native's condition had deteriorated to extremely critical. He died early Monday morning, around 4am. 'It is with an extremely heavy heart that we share this news,' said Dr Phil Smith, medical director of the Biocontainment Unit at Nebraska Medical Center, said in a statement Monday morning. 'Dr Salia was extremely critical when he arrived here, and unfortunately, despite our best efforts, we weren't able to save him.' Dr Salia had advanced symptoms of the virus when he arrived, doctors said, including kidney and respiratory failure. They desperately tried to save him by placing him on dialysis, a ventilator and giving him several medications to support his organs. He also received a blood transfusion from an Ebola survivor and a dose of the experimental serum ZMapp. 'We used every possible treatment available to give Dr Salia every possible opportunity for survival,' said Dr Smith. 'As we have learned, early treatment with these patients is essential. In Dr Salia's case, his disease was already extremely advanced by the time he came here for treatment.' Dr Salia was born in Sierra Leone but was a permanent resident of the United States and lived in New Carrollton, Maryland with his wife and children. He would spend about four months at a time working overseas. The U.S. State Department  helped facilitate the transfer of Dr Salia. The U.S. Embassy in Freetown said his wife planned to reimburse them for the cost of the private medevac flight, which has not yet been calculated. The travel costs and care of other Ebola patients flown to the U.S. have been covered by the groups they worked for in West Africa. Scroll down for video . Too sick to walk: Health care workers in protective suits helped transport Dr Salia from a medevac plane to an ambulance on Saturday, after he arrived in the U.S. for treatment at University of Nebraska Medical Center. The center previously cured two other patients of the deadly virus, currently sweeping through West Africa . Family: Dr Salia (second right) is survived by his wife Isatu Salia(second left) and two sons. The surgeon was born in Sierre Leone, but was a permanent resident of the U.S. who lived in New Carrollton, Maryland with his family when he wasn't working overseas . Ebola has killed more than 5,000 people in West Africa this year, mostly in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leona. Of the 10 people treated for the virus in the U.S., all but one has recovered. Dr Salia's death is even more tragic considering he went nearly a week, believing he was Ebola-free. The doctor started showing symptoms of the virus on November 6, but his initial test came up negative. However, CDC officials say some doctors are unaware that Ebola tests can be inconclusive in the first three days the virus is in the system. Now the three people who hugged Dr Salia after hearing news of the negative test result are in quarantine, over fears they may have been infected. So far none are symptomatic. 'We were celebrating. If the test says you are Ebola-free, we assume you are Ebola-free,' said Komba Songu M’Briwa, who cared for Salia at the Hastings Ebola Treatment Center in Freetown, told the Washington Post. 'Then everything fell apart.' After receiving his Ebola test results,  Dr Salia was released from the Ebola treatment ward but remained feverish and weak. For the next five days, his symptoms worsened to the point he started vomiting uncontrollably and suffered a high fever and diarrhea.  He was prescribed malaria medication but his condition did not improve. Eventually he called colleague Alhali Osman at the hospital where they both worked, expressing fears that  he might still have Ebola 'in spite of what the test said'. On November 10, Dr Salia took another test and this time he tested positive. It's still unclear how Dr Salia contracted the virus, since his hospital did not treat Ebola patients. Doctors there say they work with the understanding that any of their patients could be infected, which leaves them at high-risk of catching the disease since they normally only wear gloves as protection. Since the star of this year's outbreak, 320 health care workers in Sierra Leone have died of the disease. The faces of some doctors have been plastered on billboards across Freetown with he words  'some of our national heroes killed by Ebola'. Scene: The UNMC in Omaha is one of a handful of medical facilities in the United States specially designated to treat Ebola patients . Dr Salia's wife, Isatu Salia, said in a telephone interview this weekend that when she spoke to her husband early Friday and that his voice sounded weak and shaky. The couple had two children together, ages 12 and 20. 'We're very grateful for the efforts of the team led by Dr. Smith,' Mrs Salia said Monday. 'In the short time we spent [at Nebraska Medical Center], it was apparent how caring and compassionate everyone was. We are so appreciative of the opportunity for my husband to be treated here and believe he was in the best place possible.' Sierra Leone is one of the three West African nations hit hardest by the Ebola epidemic this year - the largest in history. Five other doctors in Sierra Leone have contracted Ebola, and all have died. Dr Salia was the third Ebola patient to be treated by the UNMC, one of a handful of medical facilities in the United States specially designated to treat Ebola patients. Both of the previous patients, Dr Rick Sacra and NBC cameraman Ashoka Mukpo, survived. Officials at the University of Nebraska Medical Center held a press conference Monday morning to announce Dr Salia's death and all the methods they used to try and save his life. Dr Phil Smith, director the center's biocontainment unit, pictured speaking at the conference above . Following Dr Salia's death, hospital officials held a press conference to detail the methods they used in trying to save the surgeon's life. University of Nebraska Medical Center Chancellor Jeffrey P Gold,  said health care workers at the center 'performed a truly heroic effort' and 'gave it their all' during Dr Salia's 36 hours of care in the U.S. Dr Gold also thanked the nation for the 'remarkable' outpouring of grief and support following Dr Salia's unfortunate death. 'We used the maximum amount of supportive care and every advanced technique in order to save his life,' Dr Gold said. 'We are very, very sorry the outcome is not the one we all wished for.' Dr Gold went on to say that Dr Salia's death should be a lesson of how serious the Ebola epidemic is, and how after a certain point there is little health care workers can do to save a patient. There are currently no other cases of Ebola in the United States, where nine other people have been treated for the killer virus. Dr Salia was the tenth. Only one other - Liberian-born Thomas Eric Duncan - has died from the disease on U.S. soil. Wife: Isatu Salia, seen here with her husband, described him as 'caring' and 'hardworking' Sons: The medic, who has at least two sons, including Hinwaii (left) and Maada (right), came down with symptoms of Ebola on November 6 and tested positive for Ebola last results on November 10 . Despite some hopeful signs - Liberia has lifted its state of emergency and the Democratic Republic of the Congo announced the end of its own, unrelated, outbreak of Ebola - the recent deaths of three people in Mali have fueled fears of a new African hot spot. There is no known cure for Ebola, one of the deadliest known pathogens, but trials for several possible treatments were announced this week in West Africa and Canada. The disease is spread through contact with bodily fluids. Dr Salia received his surgical training from a group called the Pan African Academy of Christian Surgeons, which seeks to train African doctors on a level comparable to training they would receive in the U.S., said Richard Toupin, of Auburn, Indiana, a fellow medical missionary. 'He is one of the best-trained surgeons in his country,' Toupin said. 'He is a very competent surgeon.' Bruce Steffes, executive director of PAACS, said Salia graduated from the surgical training program in 2008. The training includes a requirement to practice in Africa for four years after completion. As a result, Steffes said, Dr Salia was free to practice anywhere he wanted, but elected to stay in Sierra Leone, where the need for surgeons is immense. 'People like Martin are just absolutely dedicated, highly trained... and doing their best in absolutely horrifying conditions,' Steffes said. In an interview last April, with United Methodist Communications, Dr Salia spoke about his passion for health care. 'I knew it wasn’t going to be rosy, but why did I decide to choose this job? I firmly believe God wanted me to do it. And I knew deep within myself. There was just something inside of me that the people of this part of Freetown needed help,' he said. 'I see it as God’s own desired framework for me,' Dr Salia added. 'I took this job not because I want to, but I firmly believe that it was a calling and that God wanted me to. That’s why I strongly believe that God will have brought me here, will fix whatever comes to my door, (my) way. And I’m pretty sure, I’m confident that I just need to lean on him, trust him, for whatever comes in, because he sent me here. And that’s my passion.' Epidemic: .

"The number of homeless children in the U.S. has surged in recent years to an all-time high, amounting to one child in every 30, according to a comprehensive state-by-state report that blames the nation's high poverty rate, the lack of affordable housing and the impacts of pervasive domestic violence. Titled America's Youngest Outcasts, the report being issued Monday by the National Center on Family Homelessness calculates that nearly 2.5 million American children were homeless at some point in 2013. The number is based on the Department of Education's latest count of 1.3 million homeless children in public schools, supplemented by estimates of homeless pre-school children not counted by the DOE. In good care: In this June 2014 photo provided by Transition House, a homeless shelter in Santa Barbara, California, Melody, aged four, gets to work with some paints . The problem is particularly severe in California, which has one-eighth of the U.S. population but accounts for more than one-fifth of the homeless children with a tally of nearly 527,000. Carmela DeCandia, director of the national center and a co-author of the report, noted that the federal government has made progress in reducing homelessness among veterans and chronically homeless adults. 'The same level of attention and resources has not been targeted to help families and children,' she said. 'As a society, we're going to pay a high price, in human and economic terms.' Child homelessness increased by eight percent nationally from 2012 to 2013, according to the report, which warned of potentially devastating effects on children's educational, emotional and social development, as well as on their parents' health, employment prospects and parenting abilities. The report included a composite index ranking the states on the extent of child homelessness, efforts to combat it, and the overall level of child well-being. States with the best scores were Minnesota, Nebraska and Massachusetts. At the bottom were Alabama, Mississippi and California. California's poor ranking did not surprise Shahera Hyatt, director of the California Homeless Youth Project. The crux of the problem, she said, is the state's high cost of living, coupled with insufficient affordable housing. 'People think, ""Of course we are not letting children and families be homeless,"" so there's a lot of disbelief,' Hyatt said. 'California has not invested in this issue.' Hyatt, 29, was homeless on and off throughout adolescence, starting when her parents were evicted when she was in 7th grade. At 15, she and her older brother took off and survived by sleeping in the tool sheds, backyards and basements of acquaintances. 'These terms like ""couch surfing"" and ""doubled-up"" sound a lot more polite than they are in practice,' she said. 'For teenagers, it might be exchanging sex for a place to stay or staying someplace that does not feel safe because they are so mired in their day-to-day survival needs.' Growing problem: Volunteer Jodi Kirkland, center right, helps out at Transition House in California - The Golden State accounts for more than one-fifth of the homeless children with a tally of nearly 527,000 . Near San Francisco, Gina Cooper and her son, then 12, had to vacate their home in 2012 when her wages of under $10 an hour became insufficient to pay the rent. After a few months as nomads, they found shelter and support with Home & Hope, an interfaith program in Burlingame, California, and stayed there five months before Cooper, 44, saved enough to be able to afford housing on her own. 'It was a painful time for my son,' Cooper said. ""On the way to school, he would be crying, ""I hate this.""' In mostly affluent Santa Barbara, the Transition House homeless shelter is kept busy with families unable to afford housing of their own. Executive director Kathleen Baushke said that even after her staff gives clients money for security deposits and rent, they go months without finding a place to live. 'Landlords aren't desperate,' she said. 'They won't put a family of four in a two-bedroom place because they can find a single professional who will take it.' She said neither federal nor state housing assistance nor incentives for developers to create low-income housing have kept pace with demand. 'We need more affordable housing or we need to pay people $25 an hour,' she said. 'The minimum wage isn't cutting it.' Among the current residents at Transition House are Anthony Flippen, Savannah Austin and their two-year-old son, Anthony Jr. Flippen, 28, said he lost his job and turned to Transition House as his unemployment insurance ran out. The couple has been on a list to qualify for subsidized housing since 2008, but they aren't counting on that option and hope to save enough to rent on their own now that Flippen is back at work as an electrician. Austin, due to have a second child in December, is grateful for the shelter's support but said its rules had been challenging. With her son in tow, she was expected to vacate the premises each morning by 8am and not return before 5pm. 'I'd go to the park, or drive around,' she said. 'It was kind of hard.' The new report by the National Center on Family Homelessness - a part of the private, nonprofit American Institutes for Research - says remedies for child homelessness should include an expansion of affordable housing, education and employment opportunities for homeless parents, and specialized services for the many mothers rendered homeless due to domestic violence. Efforts to obtain more resources to combat child homelessness are complicated by debate over how to quantify it. Repercsussions: Child homelessness increased eight percent  from 2012 to 2013, according to a new report, which warns of potentially devastating effects on children's educational, emotional and social development . The Department of Housing and Urban Development conducts an annual one-day count of homeless people that encompasses shelters, as well as parks, underpasses, vacant lots and other locales. Its latest count, for a single night in January 2013, tallied 610,042 homeless people, including 130,515 children. Defenders of HUD's method say it's useful in identifying the homeless people most in need of urgent assistance. Critics contend that HUD's method grossly underestimates the extent of child homelessness and results in inadequate resources for local governments to combat it. They prefer the Education Department method that includes homeless families who are staying in cheap motels or doubling up temporarily in the homes of friends or relatives. 'Fixing the problem starts with adopting an honest definition,' said Bruce Lesley, president of the nonprofit First Focus Campaign for Children. 'Right now, these kids are sort of left out there by themselves.' Lesley's group and some allies have endorsed a bill introduced in Congress, with bipartisan sponsorship, that would expand HUD's definition to correlate more closely with that used by the Education Department. However, the bill doesn't propose any new spending for the hundreds of thousands of children who would be added to the HUD tally. Shahera Hyatt, of the California Homeless Youth Project, says most of the homeless schoolchildren in her state aren't living in shelters. 'It's often one family living in extreme poverty going to live with another family that was already in extreme poverty,' she said. 'Kids have slept in closets and kitchens and bathrooms and other parts of the house that have not been meant for sleeping.'","America's Youngest Outcasts report calculates that nearly 2.5 million children were homeless at some point in 2013 .

"Russian beauty: Ruslana Korshunova is pictured above on the catwalk aged 18 . New details have emerged of the last days of a Russian supermodel who leaped to her death from the ninth floor of a New York office building. Ruslana Korshunova was 20 when she plummeted from a building next door to her apartment in Manhattan's financial district in 2008. It brought to an end a career that had seen her photographed for Vogue, parade down the catwalk and front luxury ad campaigns, helped along by her flowing hair and a rare genetic quirk that meant her piercing blue eyes always seemed to glisten. The details of her death have baffled many - but new light may have been shed on her state of mind by an investigation into the Rose of the World cult that she joined shortly before her death. Details of the cult were revealed to the New York Daily News by journalist Peter Pomerantsev, who researched Korshunova's case for an upcoming book. In its pages, the Rose cult's reputation for 'dehumanizing' treatment of its followers was spelled out in detail, including meetings characterized by shouting, confusion and emotional domination. Pomerantsev, who joined the cult to experience it first-hand, said that while he was there its 'coaches' humiliated and blamed members for the wrongs in their lives - and even described Korshunova as a 'typical victim'. The unnamed male leader said: 'Ruslana was typical victim... [sic] Sometimes it's better to commit suicide than not to change.' She was driven to the group after her modelling career took a knock, and at a time her personal life was in disarray after she was jilted repeatedly by rich men who dazzled her with their wealth then left her. Korshunova was born in Kazakhstan, then part of the Soviet Union, to a Russian mother and a father in the Red Army. After the collapse of the USSR, she was picked up by modelling scouts, who seized upon her beauty and flew her to catwalks and parties around the world. Korshunova jumped from an office building next to her apartment - pictured above is her covered body in Manhattan's Financial District . Bystanders look at the model's body lying on the street in 2008 after she cut a hole in construction mesh on the ninth floor and jumped . The Rose Of The Word cult, known as Roza Mira, is an organization based in Moscow that has grown out of the works by Russsian mystic Daniil Andreev. The mystical writer aimed to unify concepts of the world's major religions but also believed in reincarnation and karma. The cult grew out of a group known as Lifespring in the U.S. in the 1980s. The organization went bankrupt after former members sued for mental health damage. Journalist Peter Pomerantsev, who studied the cult, told the Daily News that the group aims to humiliate members, blaming them for their problems. One rape victim was told it was her fault. The cult even advocates that it is better for members to die if they cant change their ways. Her high point was fronting a campaign for Nina Ricci perfume, and her glamorous lifestyle brought her into contact with rich, powerful men who would shower her with gifts to win her affection. One enamored man even flew the model to his private Caribbean island. But after one particularly destructive break-up with an unnamed handsome tycoon, who reportedly promised to marry her, her mental state took a turn for the worse. The break-up impacted her professional life, and bookings dried up, leading her towards the Moscow-based group, Rose of the World. Her ex-boyfriend Artem Perchenok told the New York Post at the time that the 20-year-old would 'take it out on herself' when a modelling job went badly. Not long after signing up for one of their courses - which reportedly cost more than $300 a day - Korshunova was found dead on the street. An NYPD investigation determined that her death was indeed a suicide, though friends and family are reluctant to believe she would have killed herself. Video Source YouTube .

The 20-year-old model was reportedly brokenhearted over the end of a relationship with a handsome tycoon . Her mother Valentina and brother Ruslan, live in Kazakhstan and at the time of her death, the model had been sending money to support them. Investigators found no suicide note  but the model had written messages online about her despair over her failed relationship and missing family and friends in Kazakhstan. They found a hole cut in construction mesh on the ninth floor along with a knife. And the fact of her landing so far from the building - having cleared it by 28 feet - suggests that by the end she was certain enough of her fate to take a running leap.

"A drizzly lunchtime in central Birmingham and I’m standing in a rubbish-strewn lay-by, squinting into a pile of discarded takeaway boxes and fizzy drinks cans. ‘D’you see?’ asks Adrian Timms, bending forward and pointing into the mess. Before me is half a dead rat — the best part of a torso, a pair of chunky hind legs, and a thick, snake-like tail. Where there should be a head, there’s a gaping wound, the surrounding fur matted with dried blood. Rats! The number of calls to Birmingham's rodent-catchers has increased 300 in the last year . Adrian, 47, is a rat-catcher. Five years ago, after packing in a career in IT to ‘spend more time with nature’, he set up Pestforce Birmingham with his father David, 73. Today, they’re taking me on a tour of the city to seek out the ‘giant rats’ which are reported to be terrorising the population. There have been 5,100 calls to the city council’s rat-catchers in the past year — 300 more than in the 12 months before — with some people claiming to have seen ‘cat-sized’ creatures ‘wide as bricks’ stalking the streets. Adrian agrees, saying he’s seen one that was 17in long. It may all sound rather far-fetched — but there’s plenty of scientific evidence showing that rats are getting bigger. ‘Creatures can certainly change in size,’ says Robin Allaby, professor in evolutionary genetics at Warwick University. He points out that humans became . bigger with improved nutrition — for example people got larger after the . Industrial Revolution because of the increase in the amount of meat in . their diet. Progress: Humans have grown bigger since the Industrial Revolution, when we increased our meat intake . ‘It may well be the same with rats,’ he says. Dr Allaby believes their increasing size is probably down to the sugary and fatty foods thrown away by humans. Across the country there have been sightings of enormous ‘super rodents’ and ‘massive mutant rats’ have allegedly been spotted in Bradford and County Durham. One shocking photo, taken in a Tunbridge Wells park by 50-year-old Mark Willmot, shows his Jack Russell clutching a dead rat between his teeth. It’s almost as big as the dog. If the rotting specimen in Birmingham doesn’t quite live up to these ratzilla proportions — what remains of the rodent measures approximately 8in — it’s still pretty big, its fur unexpectedly thick  and bushy. Adding to the revulsion, Adrian suggests the missing half of the corpse has most likely been eaten by other rats. ‘That’s the thing — they’ll eat anything!’ he says. No wonder they are growing so big. Enormous! This rat caught by Mark Willmot's Jack Russell in a Tunbridge Wells park was frightening . And the problem is compounded by many councils’ decisions to cut rubbish collections to once a fortnight and the way they encourage us to recycle unwanted food by putting it into slop buckets which are then left out  on the pavement to await the bin men. For example, Birmingham Council makes only one household bin collection a week, so rubbish bags full of discarded food are left on the street for days. This offers a true banquet for rats and, as Adrian says: ‘Any creature will continue to grow if you give it food.’ He says dumped refuse is meant to be collected within two days of it being reported — but then points to several flimsy plastic bags that have apparently been lying here for weeks. Rats love chewing on things and gnawing through plastic bags takes them seconds. Their teeth never stop growing. So, if they don’t constantly use them, their incisors would get so long that they’d curve back under their chin and pierce their brains. Another explanation for the emergence . of super-sized rats could be evolution. Dr Allaby says: ‘In evolutionary . history, rats have grown gradually bigger — for instance it happens . over time on islands where they have no predators and don’t need to be . small enough to get away quickly.’ Scavengers: Any creature will continue to grow if offered food. For rats, there's the added incentive that their teeth never stop growing - so if they don't constantly gnaw, their incisors would pierce their own heads . He mentions the now-extinct Tenerife giant rat, which grew to weigh over 2lb more than two million years ago. Indeed, scientists at Leicester University recently warned that rats in areas with a plentiful food supply and few predators could one day evolve to be as large as sheep. Though Dr Allaby cautions that significant changes would take ‘thousands’ of years. Whatever the cause, Britain’s rat population is also increasing. There are more than 80 million — that’s 1.2 rats per person and nearly 40 per cent more than in 2000. And the oft-quoted ‘fact’ that you’re only ever 6ft away from a rat is a myth, you’re unlikely ever to be much more than a 100ft from one. While this may all be great for Adrian’s business, it can be devastating for anyone unfortunate to suffer an infestation in their home. This brings the threat of disease — for rats are remarkably efficient at spreading a host of illnesses. As well as thread worm and Weil’s disease (a bacterial infection which can lead to organ failure and internal bleeding), brown rats can carry tuberculosis, salmonella, E. Coli, foot and mouth, toxoplasmosis (a parasite inducing flu-like symptoms) and cryptosporidium, which causes severe gastrointestinal problems. Disease: Rats carry E. Coli bacteria (pictured) alongside thread worm, Weil's disease and salmonella . No wonder one of Adrian’s clients, Ken Wong, who has hired him to eradicate rats from the two-bedroom house he shares with his wife and ten-month-old son Kingsley, is so worried. ‘We can’t have our son here,’ he says. ‘If we can’t get rid of the rats, we’ll have to move.’ Giant rats can also cause huge amounts of damage. Last year they were blamed for starting a massive fire at a coach company headquarters in Southampton. They had chewed through electric cables, sparking a blaze which destroyed six coaches. Another 15in rat was caught recently after it chewed through a concrete wall. As we rattle around Birmingham in his van, Adrian regales me with his own stories of havoc. ‘I’ve seen them eat through boxes of goods in shop store-rooms. Once, I dealt with an infestation in a church where rats had eaten all the Sunday School children’s sweets and drunk all their orange juice.’ He helped a family after rats had stolen chocolate Dime bars from their sitting room. Taking the blame: The disasters attributed to rats have been numerous - from a fire which gutted six coaches in a Southampton depot last year, to the Black Death which killed millions of people centuries earlier . Rats are also rather partial to dog food. Adrian says: ‘People think if they have a dog, rats will stay away. But by leaving their food on the ground, you’re only encouraging them. Getting rid of rats can take months and involves far more than simply laying a trap. M  ost rats, says Adrian, are ‘too clever’ to be deceived by traditional traps, which consist of a baited cage with a door that slams shut when the rat is inside. ‘They have ‘neophobia’, so they are scared of anything new. If you lay a trap in their path, they’ll just run around it to avoid it,’ he says. Alternatives include the use of gas or glue boards, which trap the rats as they scurry across. Adrian prefers bait boxes — bulky plastic shoebox-like containers in which he hides a small pouch of bright red rodenticide. Its effect is slow-acting, so the rats don’t learn to associate the bait with what’s killed their fellow rodents. Even this isn’t foolproof, however. It’s feared some rats are developing immunity to traditional poisons. In any case, the bigger the rat, the higher the dose of poison needed to kill it. Even then, there’s the on-going problem of keeping them away. New species? Conservationists discovered this 1.4kg giant rat living in the Indonesian jungle in 2007 . Rats can multiply almost as fast as they’re caught. They become fertile at three months and have a gestation period of just 21 days. The average litter contains ten babies, each with a life expectancy of three years. By the end of my day rat-catching, I don’t know whether I’m relieved or disappointed that we’ve not spotted anything to match a huge rat spotted a few years ago in West Yorkshire before it was shot dead by a man with an air rifle. But that’s the clever thing about rats, says Adrian — no matter how big, they’re amazingly good at avoiding human interaction. Not only are they shy and fast-moving but, unlike mice, they don’t tend to leave droppings. Instead, they have a ‘toilet area’ which they use — usually somewhere hidden, like under a cupboard. Worryingly, this means  infestations can go for months, if not years, undetected. ‘We had an old couple once in a nice clean house who only discovered they had rats living under their house when they started chewing through the floorboards,’ says Adrian. ‘There were dozens of them.’ So can anything put a stop to Britain’s giant rats? Adrian thinks there’s only one solution — and it’s not just a matter of laying more traps. ‘Ultimately, people have to take responsibility for the state they leave things in,’ he says. ‘If they’re going to leave food out, what do they expect? It’s not Nature’s fault. The only way to reduce the rat population is to reduce our mess.’","Rodents could be growing as humans did after the Industrial Revolution .

"Two 19-year-old college students were killed by a train after they were allegedly hanging out and drinking on the tracks, causing it to derail and bury them under tons of coal. Howard County police identified the victims as Elizabeth Conway Nass and Rose Louese Mayr of Ellicott City, Maryland. Nass was a student at James Madison University in Virginia and Mayr was a student at the University of Delaware, police said. The women had both posted photos and updates to their Twitter pages, one of their feet hanging off the bridge in Ellicott City, about 13 miles west of Baltimore, and another, which read: ‘Drinking on top of the Ellicott City sign.’ Scroll down for video . Tragic end: Elizabeth Nass, left, and Rose Mayr, right, both 19, were killed last night after they were apparently drinking on a train bridge, causing the coal freighter to derail . Good friends: Rose, right, pictured with an unidentified friend, left, was a college student . Inspecting: Officials look at part of the CSX freight train that derailed alongside a parking lot overnight in Ellicott City . Earlier, Nass had tweeted: ‘Once before I leave you for school… you, me, a handle of burnett’s, and some form of public transportation.’ Burnett's produces a variety of liquors, including vodka and gin. Another photo Mayr posted showed what appeared to be two women's legs dangling from a bridge. 'Levitating,' Mayr wrote. Ellicott City is a picturesque small town where there are several bars, and gift and antique shops in converted old buildings. The railroad runs across Main Street in Ellicott City, about 13 miles west of Baltimore. A person who answered the telephone at Nass' home declined to comment as did a family member who answered the phone at a number listed for the Mayr family. Two train operators were not harmed. Officials had to use cranes to remove some of the railroad cars. 'Many of those train cars fell onto automobiles, literally fell onto automobiles with the coal,' Howard County Executive Ken Ulman said. 'So you have massive piles of coal and heavy train cars on top of automobiles.' Last tweet: Mayr's last tweet was this picture looking down from the bridge down on Ellicott City . Residents checked to see if their cars or friends' vehicles had been damaged on Tuesday morning. Several grey CSX train cars were still on the bridge while others could be seen derailed farther down the rail line. A number of cars were in a wooded area of the train track that runs along the Patapsco River. Benjamin Noppenberger lives downtown and said he was getting ready for bed when he heard the derailment. He and his wife thought it sounded like gunshots and waited about 10 minutes to go outside. 'We could see all the cars that fell over. I just saw catastrophe,' he said. Jill Farrell, a 35-year-old assistant professor who lives across the street from the tracks, said she heard what sounded liked squealing brakes and then a huge crash. Massive damage: Coal that spilled from the derailed freight train, bottom, partially covers cars in the parking lot below . Long day: Workers begin to clean up the wreckage; the train  derailed while crossing an overpass west of Baltimore, killing the two 19-year-old women and crushing several cars parked near the bridge . Rich history: An official walks past part of the derailed train; The train was passing through historic Ellicott City, around 13 miles outside of Baltimore . 'It actually sounded like trains went off the tracks, and then silence,' she said. The tracks follow the route of the nation's first commercial railroad between Baltimore and Ellicott City, completed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad in 1830. Young people often party in the nearby parking lot and often hang out on the tracks, despite fences around the area. 'It's just sort of a magnet for teenage high jinks,' said Shelly Wygant of the Howard County Historical Society.

Chronicling: An official photographs derailed train cars . Overpass: Officials stand underneath a bridge where part of a CSX freight train derailed overnight . Jim Southworth, investigator in charge for the NTSB, declined to speculate on a possible cause. He said the train was going about 25 miles per hour and was equipped with video recording devices that investigators will review to help them determine what happened. Southworth said the train had two locomotives, was 3,000-feet-long and weighed 9,000 tons.About 100 pounds of coal spilled into a tributary of the Patapsco River, a major Maryland waterway that parallels the tracks, said Maryland Department of the Environment spokesman Jay Apperson. He said much more coal lay along the edge of the tributary, raising concerns it could boost the acidity of the water or threaten aquatic life. 'We could see all the cars that fell over. I just . saw catastrophe.' Witness Benjamin Noppenberger . It is not clear if the women died having been hit by the carriages or if they were in the cars when the accident happened around midnight. The NTSB is currently investigating signals, communication, conditions of the track, conditions of the bridge and equipment. They are also determining if 25 miles per hour was the correct speed for that stretch of track, said Southworth. A track expert is flying in from Chicago. Southworth also noted that the train was equipped with video that can provide information in the direction the train was headed. The incident was the second partial derailment this month in Howard County on the railway's Old Main Line .

"Taking vitamin pills containing high doses could be bad for your health new research suggests . Taking vitamin pills in high doses could be bad for your health, say scientists. A study found that voles who were given a lot of vitamins C and E had a reduced lifespan of up to a quarter. Researchers said the findings, published in Biology Letters, raise questions about the benefits of popping the supplements. The human body does not make or store vitamin C and gets its supply from fruit and vegetables. It only needs 40mg a day to keep cells healthy and promote healing. Vitamin E helps maintain the structure of cells and is found in foods such as nuts, seeds, and cereals. A man needs just 4mg a day and a woman should have 3mg. But tablets containing up to a hundred times this amount are available in health food shops. Researchers fed field voles large quantities of Vitamin E or C from the age of two months and compared their longevity to groups given a regular diet. They say that voles were used for the study as giving such high quantities of vitamins to humans would be unsafe. High doses of dietary antioxidants, such as vitamins, are commonly suggested to slow the process of cellular ageing by lessening the damage to proteins, lipids, and DNA. Previous research had shown the lives of mice could be extended by giving them supplements, but the opposite was found to be true in voles. They had much shorter lives on average if given extra Vitamin E or C. But despite these effects, the vitamin supplements had some effect in decreasing damage caused by aging. Professor Colin Selman, of Glasgow University, said: ‘When we began our research we expected voles' lifespans would be boosted by the vitamin supplements in a similar way to the mice we had tested previously so we were surprised to see that was not the case. ‘Our findings suggest major differences exist in the effects of high doses of antioxidants on oxidative damage and lifespan across species.’ Britons spend £175million a year on supplements and pills containing antioxidants claimed to help combat disease. Scientists think it is safer for people to get the vitamins they need by eating a healthy and varied diet, rather than by taking supplements . Most popular are Vitamins C and E and beta-carotene - the pigment found in carrots, tomatoes and broccoli which the body converts into Vitamin A. Ten million Britons take these vitamins regularly but some scientists have dismissed them as useless while others have branded them dangerous. Professor Selman said: ‘There's been a lot of research suggesting at best vitamin supplements produce no benefit and at worst can have deleterious effects. ‘Vitamin E pills have been linked with prostate cancer and an increased risk of all-cause mortality for example. ‘Most of the benefits have been shown in lab rodents so it's interesting the supplements were reduced the lifespan of voles which usually live for about 500 or 600 days. ‘What we did not look at is what they actually died of so it would be important to discover that in the future.’ Professor John Speakman, of Aberdeen . University, said: ‘It's unlikely randomised controlled trials examining . the effects of antioxidant supplementation on human lifespan would be . possible so we are dependent on the results of animal studies. ‘It's . impossible at this stage to extrapolate the results from this small . amount of data we have on voles and mice but it does suggest caution is . warranted in the use of high doses of antioxidant vitamins.’ Graham Keen, Executive Director of the Health Food Manufacturers' Association commented: 'The vitamin and mineral supplements industry has an exceptional record of both safety and efficacy, in the UK and worldwide. 'Figures published by the Food Standards Agency showed that there were only 11 reported reactions to food supplements over an 11 year period, the majority of them in the lowest category of harm.'","Diets rich in Vitamin C and E reduce life expectancy of voles by up to 25% .

"Flares may never be back in fashion, but with a little help from a 1970s film icon, Qantas are about to take off on a nostalgia trip. The flag carrier airline of Australia unveiled their newest boeing 737-800 aircraft on Monday but with a retro-themed 70s livery, as a tribute to 70 years of the iconic flying kangaroo logo. And who better to take a journey down 1970s memory lane with than Travolta, who is also a Qantas ambassador and massive aviation . aficionado. He even stepped out in his Qantas uniform at the event in Seattle, Washington. Scroll down for video . Qantas ambassador John Travolta unveils Qantas' new retro-designed Boeing 737-800 at the Boeing Field in Seattle, Washington . News.com.au reported that standing beneath a giant mirror ball dangling from the Boeing hangar, Travolta quipped to guests and the media: “I don’t know whether to do an Aboriginal dance or a disco dance!” After stepping out of the Qantas plane, he walked down a red carpet with two Qantas air hostesses dressed in original Pucci uniforms from the 70s. Aussie DJ Grant Smilie blasted Elton John's Rocket Man through the Boeing Hangar as the new plane was revealed. John Travolta (third right) points to the 1970s livery that Qantas was famed for throughout the world . Travolta later told news.com.au that the retro livery had particular significance to him and his career. When he took his first flight to Australia in 1980 it was on a Qantas 747SP in this colour. 'It was at the peak of my arrival in film and television,' Travolta explained. 'I’d been famous for about five years but it was my first big international trip to Australia, and I was excited, I was going to meet Olivia (Newton-John) there and she was going to take me to her house. 'I was there to promote Urban Cowboy, the movie, so my memories of this time-frame of livery are exciting, it represents a lot for me.’ The new Qantas boeing 737-800 aircraft with the retro-themed 1970s livery that made the airline so famous .

Qantas pilots and cabin crew get the red carpet treatment as the air carrier's new boeing 737-800 aircraft is unveiled . The legendary Ochre colouring that reflected the colours of the outback where Qantas was established in 1920 . The plane is the 75th Boeing 737 aircraft in its fleet, and will fly throughout Australia when it arrives in Sydney on Wednesday. The aircraft will operate across all domestic routes from November 20, and it will no doubt bring back many happy memories for passengers. The livery is also timed to mark Qantas’ 94th birthday this month. The signature element of the 1971-1984 livery design was the ochre band around the window line of the aircraft. Ochre reflected the colours of the outback where Qantas was established in 1920. The winged kangaroo logo is used on the tail and was adapted from the original 1947 version designed by Gert Sellheim. Qantas ambassador John Travolta was the ideal man to honour the 1970s and the airline's retro look . In 1984 the flying kangaroo discarded its wings, evolving to its current slender and stylised form. Qantas’ Chief Financial Officer, Gareth Evans, said the livery signifies the airline’s outback roots. The famous 1970s Qantas livery that is making a comeback on the airline's new boeing 737-800 aircraft . 'It’s a livery that will be familiar to Australians because the 70s and 80s saw Qantas become a truly global airline,' he said. 'It was a new era where long haul travel became a realistic aspiration for ordinary Australians. Millions of Australians experienced this overseas travel for the first time on a Qantas aircraft painted in this iconic design.'

"Under threat: British dairy products and the farms which produce them are under threat from cheap, often poor quality, foreign imports . Every day for the past three decades, Sue and Tom Flowers have risen at 4.45am to begin milking their 500 Holstein Friesian cows on their 370-acre dairy farm near Buxton, Derbyshire. They do not finish tending to them until 10.30pm. ‘Cows don’t allow you to take a rest,’ says Sue. ‘We work 365 days a year.’ Tom, 65, and Sue, 52, took over Old House Farm from Tom’s father 30 years ago. With the help of their son Edward, 26, they produce 7,000 litres of milk a day, which is sold to a nearby dairy processor and distributed to retailers around the country. The couple hope Edward will continue the family business when they retire. But they are worried. Despite putting in 18-hour days, Sue and Tom are struggling. They receive 33¼p per litre of milk — which, says Sue, is barely enough to cover the cost of producing it. ‘We scrimp and save, mend and make do, but I don’t know why we should be under such pressure,’ she says. Such is the situation faced by thousands of British dairy farmers. Two decades of relentless price slashing by supermarkets has seen them unable to break even — let alone earn a living. In 2012, the average dairy farm was losing around £40,000 a year. Sue has seen dozens of her friends in the farming community simply give up and seek a different way of making a living. The number of dairy farms has plummeted from more than 34,000 in 1996 to just over 10,000 today. British dairy products are being replaced by cheap, often poor quality, foreign imports. As recently as 2008, Britain was entirely self-sufficient in dairy produce. Now, British-produced goods account for only 80 per cent of the market. Some  £2.6 billion worth of dairy products are imported annually. And, to the horror of farmers, things are about to get worse. Last Monday, Tesco — which has seen its profits tumble, faced with competition from budget stores Aldi and Lidl — fired the opening salvo in a supermarket price war that is almost certain to see milk prices falling again. The grocery giant announced it would be cutting the price of its four-pint (2.27 litres) milk bottles by an unprecedented 39p, from £1.39 to £1. The price of a six-pint (3.41 litres) bottle of milk is down from £1.99 to £1.48. The move brings it into line with Asda, Aldi and Lidl, which have sold four pints of milk at £1 for more than a year. It also means milk at Tesco is cheaper than many mineral waters. This sounds like good news for the consumer — but only in the short term. Farmers fear it could eventually spell the end of the British dairy industry. To Sue Flowers, the news was a slap in . the face. ‘They are trying to devalue a wholesome product,’ she says. ‘It makes me livid.’ 'They are trying to devalue a wholesome product': Tom and Sue Flowers, who run a Dairy farm in Friden, Derbyshire, are 'livid' at Tesco's decision to slash the price of its milk to just 25p a pint . When announcing the cut, Tesco proudly declared that its suppliers wouldn’t suffer. The supermarket gets its own-brand milk from a select group of 650 farmers, who will still be paid above the cost of production. For the other 9,000-odd dairy farmers in Britain, however, such assurances offer little comfort. ‘They claim it won’t affect us, but it’s a lie,’ says David Handley, a dairy farmer from Monmouthshire, who chairs the grassroots Farmers For Action campaign. ‘Every other retailer will want to follow suit.’ Though Tesco farmers may be insulated, the majority of dairy farmers — around 75 per cent — don’t belong to price-guaranteed pools. They sell directly to processors, who set their prices according to what retailers will pay. ‘The whole supply chain will come under pressure,’ says Mansel Raymond, chair of the National Farmers Union milk board. ‘Soon, someone will come along and try to undercut Tesco.’ Sure enough, on Tuesday Sainsbury’s also slashed the price of four pints from £1.39 to £1. The Co-operative cut the price of one and two-pint bottles to 45p and 85p. On Friday, Waitrose — having insisted it had no plans to cut milk prices — reduced four-pint bottles from £1.39 to £1 for customers with a mywaitrose card. Morrisons, meanwhile, undercut them all by reducing two-litre cartons of Meadow Park milk — equivalent to just over 3.5 pints — from 97p to 84p (meaning it costs around 24p a pint). How long until every retailer in Britain does the same? And how long before Tesco tries to gain the commercial edge again by cutting its price further? Race to the bottom: Sainsbury's responded to Tesco's price cut by slashing its milk prices to match, while Morrisons went further and cut the price of its milk to the equivalent of 24p a pint . It’s the latest chapter in a struggle that began in 1994, when the Milk Marketing Board, which had previously set milk prices according to production costs, was abolished. The move shifted power away from farmers and into the hands of supermarkets, who began demanding ever-cheaper produce. Whereas in 1997 dairy farmers were receiving 25p per litre of milk, by 2006 it was 17p per litre — 4p less than the 21p cost of making it. By 2010, it was back up to around 25p per litre, but 5p below the cost of production. As a result, consumers developed a growing — and, say farmers, unrealistic — expectation that milk should be available cheaply. Some warned that the only way for the British dairy industry to survive would be to go the way of the U.S., and reorganise farms into so-called ‘mega farms’, where thousands of animals are reared indoors and production costs are lower. Already, cows are suffering. The average yield per cow has more than doubled in the past 40 years. In 2012, British cows produced an average of 7,604 litres each during their ten-month lactation — nearly 1,000 more than ten years ago. This increased demand places the animals under physical strain. Over-milking can result in disease and infection and shorten their working lives. Whereas dairy cows can live up to 20-25 years, producing milk for 15 years, today the average British cow has just three years of milking, and is then sent to slaughter. Meanwhile, with more than two dairy farms going out of business every day in Britain, farming has one of the highest suicide rates of any profession. Suffering: The average yield per cow has more than doubled in the past 40 years, an increased strain that places the animals under strain, resulting in disease and infection and shortening their working lives . But the supermarkets haven’t suffered. Their average gross margin — the difference between the price they sell milk for, and the price they pay farmers or milk processors — is estimated to be more than 30 per cent. Little wonder farmers have begun taking matters into their own hands. In July 2012, more than 2,000 took part in protests around the country, blockading milk-processing plants and disrupting supermarket supplies. Ironically, until Tesco’s latest move, it appeared their action might have paid off. Following the protests, the then farming minister Jim Paice drew up a ‘voluntary code of conduct’ for processors allowing farmers to terminate contracts if they could no longer afford to produce at the price offered. A number of supermarkets established ‘pools’ of dedicated milk suppliers to whom they guaranteed the cost of production — an approach pioneered by Marks & Spencer in 2000. Several processors, including Arla Foods, which supplies Morrisons, and Muller Wiseman, which supplies Sainsbury’s, increased the price paid to farmers. With the cost of production at around 28-30p per litre, the average farmer was, by the start of this year, receiving around 31p per litre. Given that the average farm produces around a million litres a year, that works out at a household income of £10,000 — not even the minimum wage, but an improvement on recent years. The fact that Tesco’s price cut should come at the moment when, for the first time in more than a decade, dairy producers had reason to be optimistic only makes it harder to swallow. For some, the writing is already on the wall. For example, this is the first year Peter and Youleite Parks won’t be producing any milk on their second-generation farm in Surrey. Having worked 12 hours day, seven days a week for more than a decade, they have given up after what Youleite, 59, describes as ‘years of not making a penny’, and are selling off their dairy cows one by one.","More than two British dairy farms go out of business every day .

"It’s barely 11am on a sweltering Saturday morning in Memphis, Tennessee, and the air is thick with the smell of charred meat. A nearby loudspeaker blasts out Eighties rock while, all around me, men in stetsons and sunglasses sweat over enormous steel cookers billowing smoke. Welcome to the World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest – aka the ‘Super Bowl of Swine’ – where it’s never too early to fire up the grill. 'Barbecue virgin' Alice-Azania Jarvis gets stuck in to the World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest . A team of butchers from Asda travelled to Memphis, to barbecue with the best in the world . The fierce cooking competition attracted 100,000 entrants and visitors . Now in its 36th year, the competition attracts more than 250 entrants who battle it out across dozens of categories – from best ribs to best chicken wings - for cash prizes of up to $50,000 and, ultimately, the chance to be crowned Grand Champion of Barbecue. Teams with names such as The Notorious P.I.G., Lords of the Swine and The Grandmasters of Cooking Disasters have been here since Thursday, setting up their stalls in preparation for today’s extravaganza. The competition grounds – a mile long stretch of grass along the Mississippi river – are heaving with the 100,000 barbecue fans and spectators who’ve paid $10 a head to be here. As competition organiser Diane Hampton - a businesslike woman in khaki trousers and horn-rimmed glasses - puts it: ‘This is the granddaddy of grill contests.’ To a barbecue virgin such as myself, it’s all a little overwhelming. I’m here because, as well as teams from virtually every US State, there is one lonely British delegation, who’ve entered two categories: beef brisket and best ribs. Sent by the supermarket ASDA, the nine-strong group – six men, three women, all ASDA employees - is hoping to take on the Yanks at their own game. And let’s get one thing straight – it is very much their own game. Because you can forget charred sausages and limp burgers - this is Southern Barbecue in all its smoky, super-sized glory. Here, great slabs of meat are slow-cooked over wood fires for up to 18 hours at a time. The fat of the meat melts slowly, keeping it tender, while the wood infuses it with flavour. Alice-Azania Jarvis samples some of the delicacies the competition has to offer . Cooked to perfection: Meat is slow cooked for up to 18 hours and judged by how tender it is . Alice tries some of the beef brisket and ribs cooked up the British Asda team . It’s a culinary art dating back to . the Wild West, and every town across the South has its own version – . from Memphis’s sticky ribs to North Carolina’s pulled pork. All are represented here, cooked by teams of red-faced men armed with tongs and lots and lots of beer. Each one has its own pitch, where . they have erected their barbecue along with plastic chairs, tables, . gazebos and huge tarpaulin banners bearing their team’s name. Most have . wired up their own sound system, too – hence the Eighties rock. Looking around, I can’t help but think . our British team – authentic as their beef brisket and ribs may look - . stand about as much chance of winning as Eddie the Eagle at the Winter . Olympics in 1988. But Mark Richmond, a former professional chef who now works for ASDA’s recipe team and is heading up the British contingent, is confident. ‘No matter what anyone says, we’re here to win – and I think we can.’ He has been practicing since this time last year, even setting up a barbecue in the car park of ASDA’s Leeds headquarters. By lunchtime, the aroma of pork ribs and beef brisket hanging in the air, my appetite is getting the better of me. Disappointingly, the meat being grilled by competitors is reserved for the competition judges - but a strip of food trucks running through the middle of the site is a meat-lover’s paradise. There are dozens of stalls offering everything from chicken wings and pulled pork to ribs and burgers. Master butchers sharpen their knives ahead of the competition . Each of the 285 entrants have their own specialty from sticky ribs to pulled pork . About 100,000 barbecue fans turn up to the competition to sample the huge range of griddled meats .

T-shirts emblazoned with ‘Grillmaster’ and . ‘The Fame is the Flame’ sell like hotcakes while elsewhere you can buy . butcher’s knives, barbecue tongs and rhinestone-encrusted cowboy hats. As the day wears on, and the mercury soars over 30 Celsius, a mood of focussed calm descends over the competitors. Many here are seasoned hands on the . barbecue circuit (yes, there is such a thing – Memphis’s World . Championship is the crowning jewel in a calendar of similar events . across the South, from Kansas to the Carolinas). Competition is fierce . and every team has its own ‘secret’ for success. This . is the 10th year that Memphis oil refinery workers Lee Smith,39, and . Todd Swirka, 41, have entered. Their team is called Refined Swine, and . their grill is shaped like a huge cylindrical drum. They built it . themselves. Says Lee: ‘It's the highlight of the . year. We enjoy cooking and there's camaraderie between the teams. We're . entering the ribs - we have our own dry rub on it. That's the trick - . but we can't tell you what's in it.' The . seven judges allocated to each team are no less dedicated. In . preparation for today, they have undergone eight hours of training – . taking in everything from animal anatomy to lessons in meat texture. Entrants come up with a range of imaginative names including the Notorious P.I.G and Lord of the Swine . The barbecue Memphis meat fest is not suitable for vegetarians . BBQ kings: Jason Kobeck (left) and Mark Morris of team Refined Swine at the Super Bowl of Swine . Judging is a complex combination on . stall inspection (teams get points for cleanliness) and a blind taste . test in an enormous tent at the heart of the festival site. ‘There . are three things we look for: appearance, tenderness, and taste,’ says . Ron Childers, a local weatherman who has been judging barbecue contests . in his spare time for more than a decade. Munching through all that meat, he says, can be daunting. ‘I always put on a couple of pounds at competition time – you just take two bites of each entry but you end up consuming a lot.’ Finally, though, more than six hours after they begin, Ron and co are ready to give their verdict. As the sun sets over the banks of the Mississippi, an excitable local news anchor named Brian Basham takes to a stage in the centre of the site to announce the winners. The top ten in each category traipse up one by one to whoops of applause and the odd yell of 'we love pork'. In all, the ceremony takes almost two hours - not that anyone seems to mind. The British team don’t quite make it up– finishing 39th (out of 108) in the beef brisket category and 67th (of 121) in the pork ribs. Those are won by Fireman John's, a group from Madison in Mississippi headed up by, yes, a fireman named John, and High Life on the Hog, from nearby Corvada, respectively. And the Grand Championship – awarded to whoever scores highest overall, regardless of category – goes to Sweet Swine of Mine, from Olive Branch in Mississippi, who also won the Pork Shoulder category. Nevertheless, Mark and his team are satisfied: 'It's about the learning. We're competing against the kings of Barbecue - and one day we'll be one of them. We'll be back next year.'","About 100,000 barbecue fans travelled to the competition in Memphis .

Half the ear was left flapping down and Smith’s face was covered in blood . The 32-year-old said: ‘I could still see. I still had my hands. I wanted to fight. I’m disappointed. It wasn’t the way I wanted that fight to end. I wish my ear hadn’t done that. Man, that ear was a bummer.’ She explained that she had been draining the cauliflower ear every night and said that it now looked ‘pretty gnarly’.

"David Cameron loves it, Dick Cheney's a fan and even Justin Bieber likes a game. Now Angry Birds, the online game played by 200 million people worldwide, has been given the royal seal of approval too. The Duke of Cambridge has teamed up with makers Rovio Entertainment in a bid to raise awareness of the plight of the pangolin. Pangolins - or scaly anteaters - will appear in an Angry Birds tournament over the next seven days, with William calling for more to be done to save the animals. Scroll down for video . Partnership: The Duke has teamed up with the makers of Angry Birds in a bid to save the pangolin . Important: William said he hopes that more people will become aware of the pangolin through Angry Birds . Speaking in a video message that accompanied the launch of the new-look game, William said he hoped the appearance of pangolins in Angry Birds would give a boost to efforts to stop poaching. 'The humble pangolin, a scaly anteater, is one of the most endangered animals on the planet because of poaching,' he said. 'The pangolin runs the risk of becoming extinct before most people have even heard of them.' Pangolins are the world's only fully scaly mammal but numbers have gone into freefall in recent years, thanks in no small part to poaching. The animals, which live mostly in China and south-east Asia, are considered a delicacy and are also in high demand for use in traditional medicine, as well as for use in home decoration. As a result, the animals now boast the unfortunate distinction of being one of the most trafficked species in the world, with an estimated one million individuals taken from the wild in the last decade according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Endangered: The pangolin is considered a delicious delicacy in its native China and Vietnam . Animal lover: William, seen here inspecting a bilby at Sydney Zoo, has long supported conservation efforts . Giving it a go: Prince William tries his hand at the new Angry Birds pangolin game . So marked has the decline in their numbers become, all eight species of pangolin were added to the IUCN's 'Red List' during the summer, which means they are at imminent risk of extinction. 'All eight pangolin species are now listed as threatened with extinction, largely because they are being illegally traded to China and Vietnam,' said Professor Jonathan Baillie, Co-Chair of the IUCN SSC Pangolin Specialist Group, following the announcement in July. 'In the 21st century we really should not be eating species to extinction – there is simply no excuse for allowing this illegal trade to continue.' The Duke of Cambridge is president of an umbrella charity called United for Wildlife, which aims to tackle poaching, whether of pangolins or of larger animals such as rhinos and elephants. 'As president of United for Wildlife, I am working with some of the world's largest conservation organisations to fight the illegal wildlife trade,' he added. Important work: The pangolin is critically endangered thanks to near constant poaching . Lucky: This pangolin was rescued but many more are killed to be used in traditional Chinese medicine . Awareness: William, Harry and the Duchess of Cambridge are all supporters of United for Wildlife . 'This criminal trade is responsible for the illegal slaughter of tens of thousands of animals a year, famously elephant and rhino. 'These species are being pushed to the brink of extinction due to poaching. These magnificent creatures will die out in the wild during my lifetime if we do not take notice now.' The Duke hopes that this week's Angry Birds tournament, which follows a similar effort with the game Runescape earlier this year on behalf of rhinos, will encourage more people to get involved and spread the word about pangolins. 'I would love your help to spread the message about this crisis. It may sound trivial set against other world problems, but it is an important part of the jigsaw - and it is one that you can do something about. 'There is evidence that poaching funds criminal gangs, even terrorist organisations, and it deprives ancient communities of their heritage and livelihoods. 'By spreading the message about poaching, I hope you can be part of a movement that says no to poached ivory and rhino horn, and many other animal parts.'","William appeared in a video to promote an Angry Birds tournament .

"He was darling of Goodison Park this time last year, hailed by supporters for bringing back ‘the School of Science’. Having got Everton playing a slick, fast brand of football that almost took them into the Champions League, Roberto Martinez could do no wrong but, suddenly, he has become the topic of an increasingly heated debate. The argument? He needs to change and get Everton playing a more solid and direct style, like David Moyes favoured. Maybe some watched Real Sociedad’s backs-to-the-wall victory against Barcelona and were reminded of similar big wins that their former manager had inspired. Roberto Martinez is under pressure at Everton with his team lying just four points ahead of the relegation zone . Everton have been struggling in the Premier League and have failed to hit the heights of last season . A 2-0 defeat by Hull on New Year's Day was Everton's fourth Premier League loss in a row . In many ways, Saturday’s match against Manchester City would have suited Moyes perfectly. He had an outstanding record against them, drilling his players to stay in two banks of four before pouncing on the break or at a set-piece. Everton were a persistent thorn in City’s side. But I will be honest — talk of Martinez needing to change is baffling. He has said he is not a manager who will play percentage football. He has principles and it should be remembered he got the job at Everton on the back of hatching a plan that toppled City in the 2013 FA Cup final. These same people 12 months ago were saying Moyes should have been more open and dynamic like Martinez yet here they are saying Martinez now needs to be pragmatic like Moyes. So where is the consistency? Romelu Lukaku's late goal earned Everton an FA Cup third round replay against West Ham . Everton's squad features a lot of the same players from last season such as Lukaku and Steven Naismith . Martinez took Everton to the brink of Champions League qualification last season . Everything he has worked on over the past 18 months, all his principles, get thrown out of the window if he switches. Had Martinez felt ‘defence first’ was the way to take Everton forward, he’d have been doing it since day one. Look at Brendan Rodgers. A few weeks ago, Liverpool were criticised for being too open, so he made them solid and took seven points out of nine, conceding one goal. Yet that wasn’t him. As soon as he could, he got his technical players back in the team. Do not take this as me trying to sugarcoat a sequence of four consecutive losses in the Barclays Premier League — Everton’s worst run since December 2005 — and a last-gasp draw against West Ham in the FA Cup. But to suggest the manager’s position might be vulnerable is madness. Martinez talks to Ross Barkley during Everton's defeat by Southampton at St Mary's in December . David Moyes saw his Real Sociedad side beat Barcelona last Sunday in La Liga . An own goal from Barcelona defender Jordi Alba was enough for Real Sociedad to earn a 1-0 victory . So it should not be about him changing or copying what Moyes did: it is about being better at what he does. He will recognise better than anyone that performances have not been good enough and issues need to be addressed. Confidence is a problem. Everton threw away four points in the first two games against Leicester and Arsenal and Martinez thinks the scars remain. You can see that. When Everton are confident, they are aggressive and the ball moves quickly. Without confidence, they are laboured and ponderous. Other aspects need to be factored in. Phil Jagielka, Leighton Baines and Tim Howard have not been at their best. Is that down to the lingering effects of the World Cup or is it because they are another year older? What about Sylvain Distin (37) and Gareth Barry (33) too? Everton have several players ageing in the same area of the pitch. Is that why, after 20 games, they have conceded 33 goals compared with 19 at this stage last season — or is it because Martinez hasn’t tweaked things to make them less exposed? Brendan Rodgers has seen his Liverpool side struggle this season, much like Martinez . Then there are the effects of the Europa League. Everton have been superb in Europe. They beat Wolfsburg, who are second in the Bundesliga, home and away and finished top of their group. That shows there is a good side waiting to emerge. Does playing in Europe liberate them? There is no doubt the added games have hindered domestic results — they have taken only seven points from 18 after Europa League fixtures — but at least that dream is alive, unlike the target in August, which was Champions League qualification. They won’t get into the top four and that will also play on the minds of players who got so close last year. When Liverpool almost won the title in 2009, we lost two of our 38 games. The following season, we lost two of our first three. Psychologically, it becomes difficult when belief wanes. When you then factor in the devastating injuries to John Stones and James McCarthy — players who bring the best out of Jagielka and Barry — you can see why Everton are in the bottom half of the table but, even if they lose to City, I don’t see them fighting relegation. Phil Jagielka and Gareth Barry look dejected after Everton fell behind against West Ham . Jagielka has struggled to reproduce his form from last year in a blue shirt this season . Leighton Baines has been in indifferent form recently for Everton after a strong start to the season . Sylvain Distin reached the age of 37 in December . I remember a similar situation to this in January 1997. Everton had a run of four straight defeats, which included an FA Cup shock against Bradford. A few weeks later, they hastily and unexpectedly parted company with manager Joe Royle. Royle had saved the club from relegation, won the FA Cup in 1995 and got Everton back into the top six but losing him set them back years. Only when chairman Bill Kenwright brought in Moyes did they begin to move forward again. The club really found their stride last season. Martinez, who has the best win percentage of any Everton manager in the Premier League era, masterminded a double over Manchester United, a 3-0 demolition of Arsenal and inflicted Jose Mourinho’s first defeat since his return to England. What the noise around Martinez has shown, is that football — more than ever before — is about winning and his task now is to give Evertonians ‘proper’ memories. He has to find a way of bringing silverware to Goodison. Young defender John Stones has seen the first half of his season ruined by injury . James McCarthy has missed a number of matches so far this season due to hamstring injuries . Everton topped Europa League Group H ahead of Wolfsburg, Krasnodar and Lille . He delivered a club Premier League record of 72 points and while that was fantastic, it won’t live long in the memory. City’s emergence and the financial strength of other clubs means getting into the top four will always be a struggle. Winning a cup, however, should not be impossible. When I was kid watching the 1987 title-winning side, nobody would have believed only one more trophy would be added in the next 28 years. That is the only thing Martinez should be worried about changing. Jamie Carragher's Liverpool side only lost two games in 2008-09 when they almost won the title . Simeone makes me want to put my boots back on! The Ballon d’Or is awarded to the world’s best player in Zurich on Monday but I am far more interested in who is named coach of the year. Carlo Ancelotti, for securing Real Madrid’s 10th Champions League, and World Cup winner Joachim Low will have their supporters but if it was down to me, the prize would go to the third man on the shortlist — Diego Simeone. His work with Atletico Madrid, which was crowned by winning La Liga last season, has been unbelievable for the past three years and I watched in awe again on Wednesday night when he inspired his side in the Copa del Rey to a third consecutive victory over Real. Diego Simeone has been nominated for coach of the year at FIFA's awards in Zurich on Monday . Simeone is one of three finalists after guiding Atletico Madrid to the La Liga title in 2014 . The Argentine boss broke the Barcelona and Real Madrid dominance to win the Spanish title . A 2-0 victory over rivals Real on Wednesday was Atletico's third straight Madrid derby win . That is three straight derby wins after losing the Champions League final to their neighbours. You would have thought losing in Lisbon would have had a psychological impact on Atleti but nothing could be further from the truth. Simeone is the type of manager you would run through a brick wall for — I’d even come out of retirement for him! — and you can see his squad have total belief in him. He would be a magnificent addition to our game. In some ways, Atleti remind me of the Liverpool sides I played for under Rafa Benitez and Gerard Houllier. We might not have been the easiest on the eye but we had absolute belief that wherever we went in Europe we would get a result. Simeone has given that to Atleti. Atletico were denied Champions League glory as well after losing to Real Madrid in the final in Lisbon . Italian Carlo Ancelotti is another finalist for coach of the year after his exploits with Real Madrid . Joachim Low guided his Germany team to World Cup glory in Brazil this summer . This week I'm looking forward to... Pardew’s League debut with Palace . So the big question for Crystal Palace’s new manager is whether he can have the same effect as Tony Pulis and keep his side in the Premier League. Alan Pardew has a tough baptism against rejuvenated Tottenham today but his first game as Newcastle manager was against Liverpool in December 2010. Newcastle won that 3-1. Some seem surprised he has made the move but, in many ways, it makes a lot of sense. Geographically, it will help his family and professionally he will get more help from his board and supporters. Pardew  is a good manager and I admire that he has been working in the Barclays Premier League for a long time. It will be interesting to see how things map out at club for which he has a genuine affinity. Alan Pardew was named as Crystal Palace's new manager in place of Neil Warnock . Pardew's first game in charge of Newcastle in December 2010 saw them beat Liverpool 3-1 .","Everton are on their worst run since December 2005, but the Goodison Park fans must get behind Roberto Martinez .

"Prince Charles might be the royal family's best-known gardening fan but it seems he isn't the only one after it was revealed that Prince Harry will take part in next summer's Chelsea Flower Show. The royal is to present an African-themed garden on behalf of his charity, Sentebale, which supports orphans and vulnerable children living in Lesotho. But Harry, 30, isn't doing it alone, with garden designer Matt Keightley revealing that Prince Charles has had almost as much input as his son. Scroll down for video . Green-fingered: Prince Harry is to take part in next year's Chelsea Flower Show with a charity garden . Charles, who famously once admitted to talking to the plants at his Highgrove estate in Gloucestershire, has taken an advisory role in the design. 2013's Sentebale garden, which was designed by Jinny Blom, was awarded a silver gilt medal but Mr Keightley, 30, hopes to go one better and pick up a gold. The centrepiece of his garden design will be a building inspired by Sentebale’s new residential facility for children with Aids/HIV that is opening in Lesotho next year. There will also be a dramatic rocky waterfall which is typical of the rugged terrain of Lesotho, known as the Mountain Kingdom. The young designer’s garden, which is will cost a six figure sum, is being sponsored by a charitable foundation set up by entrepreneur David Brownlow. His spokesman Ben Rawson said: 'Prince Charles has the Prince’s Foundation for Building Community, which has worked with Sentebale in Lesotho. Stylish: The garden, which has been designed by Matt Keightley, has had input from Prince Charles . Resemblance: The design is supposed to mirror the rugged terrain of mountainous Lesotho . Man in charge: Garden designer Matt Keightley, 30, is in charge of the charity project . 'As patrons of the two charities, both Prince Charles and Prince Harry, have had input into the design of the garden. Prince Charles has a tremendous interest in gardening from the work he has done at Highgrove. 'I think he probably cares more about raising awareness about Lesotho than he does winning a gold medal for the garden. 'But that would be nice for the designer and contractors as recognition of their efforts.' Rawson, who is commercial director of Brownlow’s investment firm Havisham Group and a trustee of his David Brownlow Charitable Foundation, added: 'Matt’s garden will be Lesotho-themed. 'He cannot use native plants because they would not survive here at that time of year and so he has to use European flowers for the same look. 'This is about trying to give people a window into Lesotho and inspire them to dig into their pockets to help Prince Harry to finish the work he has started out there.' In a 1986 interview, Charles, who is devoted to environmental issues, famously said: 'I just come and talk to the plants, really - very important to talk to them. They respond.' He was filmed in 2013 by BBC1’s Countryfile making hedgerows at Highgrove and presenter Julia Bradbury asked if this was something he still did. The green-fingered heir to the throne joked self-deprecatingly: 'No, now I instruct them instead.' Charles, 66, visits Chelsea most years, while Harry, 30, attended for the first time in 2013 and gave his father and the Queen a guided tour of his Sentebale garden. Keightley, who is based in Richmond, south-west London, designed a World War I-themed garden at Chelsea in 2014 for military charity Help for Heroes, which Harry also supports. It was inspired by the tales of his brother serving five tours of Afghanistan and soldiers wounded serving their country. His ""Hope on the Horizon"" garden was in the shape of the Military Cross, the decoration for extreme bravery awarded since 1914, and was also awarded a silver gilt medal by the Chelsea judges. Keightley, who has been designing since the age of 17, scooped the prestigious People’s Choice award too on his Chelsea debut. After the show, his entire garden, which included an avenue of hornbeam trees, was rebuilt at a recovery centre run by Help for Heroes in the garrison town of Colchester, Essex. Pretty: Mr Keightley's design for the 2014 show's Help For Heroes garden . Gardening fan: Prince Charles and the Queen are regular attendees at the RHS Chelsea Flower Show . Proud: Harry last entered in 2013 and showed the Queen around the Sentebale creation on the opening day . Keightley said: 'I am honoured to be working with Sentebale, The Prince’s Foundation for Building Community and Prince Harry on this very special garden. 'It is such an inspirational project that I am delighted to be able to help raise awareness of. 'Last year was my first RHS Chelsea Flower Show and to have achieved the silver gilt and the People’s Choice awards for the Hope on the Horizon garden was incredible and I am thrilled to be working once again at the world-famous show and I will be incorporating so many positives of the great work that Sentebale does in the garden design.' Sentebale chief executive Cathy Ferrier said: 'Matt Keightley has created a truly inspirational garden that will be a representation of the experience that the children in Lesotho go through during our Mamohato camp. 'The garden will give visitors a taste of Lesotho and the bright, vibrant atmosphere of the Mamohato camp and will include a rock waterscape feature, which is representative of the mountainous region.' Close: Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall were also given a guided tour of the garden . Partnership: Harry and garden designer Jinny Blom were awarded a silver gilt medal for their efforts . A Chelsea insider predicted that the public will love the latest design - putting Keightley on course for a gold medal. He said: 'Keightley’s garden is a proper show garden that you know visitors will love. The last one got lots of publicity but you didn’t see the crowds looking at it. I think this one will do better.' Blom’s 'forget-me-not' garden in 2013 boasted willows, pines and a traditional Lesotho round house. Sentebale means ‘forget-me-not’ in Sesotho, the main language spoken in Lesotho, where the charity, founded by Harry in 2006, works with victims of extreme poverty and Aids/HIV. Harry emailed her his feedback from Camp Bastion, in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, where he was serving as an Apache helicopter co-pilot. The Prince’s Foundation for Building Community is a charity dedicated to promoting 'beautiful, harmonious and enduring' urban development using sustainable principles. It acts as a 'champion', bringing together developers, designers, local authorities and local communities and has advised Sentebale in the design of its new Mamohato Children’s Centre in Lesotho. The charity confirmed Charles’ involvement in the Chelsea garden but declined to give any details. Brownlow, who works in the financial services industry, is a trustee of Charles’ Dumfries House in Ayrshire, Scotland and chairman of the Prince’s Foundation for Building Community. Last year, he donated £1.5 million to fund the restoration of the Dumfries estate’s four and a half acre walled garden.","Prince Harry, 30, is overseeing the creation of an African-themed garden .

"I was filling the camper van with petrol at 3.30am in Salome, Arizona, and couldn't help but notice the large man with an out-of-control orange beard walking towards me. 'Could you tell me when Pippa's passing this way?' he asked. The Pippa in question was Pippa Middleton, who, with her brother James were members of an eight-person team participating in the 2014 Race Across America (RAAM) cycle race. Wide open spaces: America - with landmarks such as the Grand Canyon - is a wonderful country for cycling . I was a member of a team in the same event, so I had the answer - but not the one he was looking for. He'd missed her: Pippa and her crew were slightly quicker than us, and a few hours ahead. The news disappointed my bearded friend. RAAM is regarded as one of the toughest cycle races in the world, with competitors starting on the West Coast in Oceanside, California, and finishing 3,020 miles and a total of 170,000ft of climbing later in Annapolis, Maryland, on the East Coast. Once the clock starts, it doesn't stop until the team cross the finishing line. For solo riders, this means an average of 90 minutes' sleep every 24 hours during the seven to 11 days they are on the road. Girl on a mission: Pippa Middleton took part in the 2014 RAAM (left); in her usual glamourous mode (right) When I say I was part of a team, I must confess that I wasn't actually taking part. I was a member of the 13-strong back-up crew required to make sure our four riders, all raising money for Asthma UK, travelled across the US as quickly and safely as possible, and we did it in seven days, nine hours and 42 minutes. The race is in its 34th year and attracts somewhere in the region of 350 riders and more than 1,000 support crew who handle all the logistics - including food, fluids, navigation, laundry, medical needs and bike repairs, so that all the riders have to do is race. It was a major life experience for all our riders. None had experienced sleep deprivation on this scale. Crew tended to get a couple of hours' sleep every 14 hours or so, with riders slightly more. For the first 24 hours everyone runs on adrenaline, the next 24 are tough but bearable, but by day three you can see only what other crew members aren't doing and fail to recognise anything they actually do. It was on the third day of the event that we actually saw crew members from another team wrestling each other by the side of the road. And we heard of another team who'd been forced to hire an additional back-up vehicle as two of their crew could no longer share the same space. This thing is tough. However, after day three the body becomes more used to the lack of sleep and some form of 'status quo' returns. Although there were more dark moments along the way, I can no longer recall them and it's the highlights that will live with me for ever. An A-list attraction: Passing through Monument Valley (in Arizona and Utah) was one of David's highlights . From a scenic point of view, the route is stunning. A few personal recollections in chronological order: . *The 4,000ft descent from the San Diego mountains via 'The Glass Elevator' - the road into the Mojave Desert, 170ft below sea level with temperatures in excess of 110F. * The stunning Monument Valley, characterised by clusters of vast iconic red sandstone buttes. * Riding at 10,000ft over the snow-capped Rockies. * The arrow-straight roads disappearing into the horizon across the High Plains of Kansas. * The Mississippi River and the beautiful, densely wooded Appalachians. * The famous Civil War battlefield at Gettysburg in Pennsylvania. We arrived at the Atlantic Ocean in Annapolis shattered but with the most amazing sense of achievement, and a bond between a group of individuals that will last for ever. The logistics of getting a team of four cyclists non-stop to the end of a 3,000-mile race are complicated. As a crew, we planned for several months prior to the race while the riders trained. We decided to operate two crews and work in seven-hour shifts. Each shift would see two riders alternating on the road, usually doing a half-hour stint each before swapping. At the end of seven hours, they'd be replaced by the two riders who had been resting. On the road behind each pair of riders there was a driver, a navigator and a nutritionist, who ensured that the riders were topped up with fluids and food. Just another 2,000-ish miles ago: A member of David's team keeps the pedals turning across America . In the Mojave Desert, one of our riders consumed more than six litres of fluid during his seven-hour shift and still managed to lose some 4lb in weight. Supporting these people were the guys and girls in the motorhome, who made sure that a hearty meal was prepared for the riders coming on to shift and something even more substantial for those coming off. They also took care of laundry, food shopping, the constant supply of ice, blogging, updating our website, and any other unforeseen requirements thrown at them. The motorhome was also the communications hub, which presented its own set of challenges when no signal of any form could be detected for many miles in the more remote areas along our route. One of the 'unforeseens' came when we discovered that a couple of our riders and crew couldn't sleep in a moving vehicle. To solve this problem we'd anticipate where a shift would end and try to book a motel room there. The resting riders would be driven about 120 miles along the route and deposited in the room. The incoming riders would jump into the 'still warm' beds and rest before themselves being transported a further 120 miles to the next change of shift. As a crew member, I got to meet a few locals as I travelled from west to east. Apparently more than half of Americans have never travelled outside the USA, almost two-thirds do not even own a passport and more than a few have never been outside their own state. So when you mention you're part of a team cycling across America, they're stunned and impressed in equal measure. Continental divide: David's route took him over the wide water of the River Mississippi (pictured here in Iowa) I'm not suggesting the following encounter is typical, but it certainly made an impression on me… . Halfwaythrough the race we were having some difficulties with a faulty generator on our motorhome. So one of our crew wandered over to a giant truck, explained our problem to the driver and asked if he could possibly help. After a moment, the driver looked down and said: 'I don't know nothing about generators.' He then paused for several seconds before continuing: 'But I know a whole lot about chickens.' Fortunately, we hadn't experienced any problems with chickens, so his expertise in this area wasn't required. A few of our crew and cyclists were so moved by the overall RAAM experience they are planning a 'race within a race' next year. As 2015 sees the Rugby World Cup taking place, they approached numerous former international rugby players from around the world and invited them to participate. Many have responded saying they're keen. It seems cycling is the preferred method of keeping fit for retired players with 'dodgy knees' (they have no idea what they're letting themselves in for!). If you fancy taking part in such an experience, ask yourself the following questions: Do I have a sense of adventure? Can I function on very little sleep? Do I have a modicum of common sense? Am I willing to commit to a seriously tough challenge? If the answer to all of these is yes, take a look at the RAAM website - www.raceacrossamerica.org. Who knows, you might be inspired to get a team together and enter the challenge. Our team covered all our costs (excluding flights, which were paid by each individual) through corporate sponsorship and in addition raised more than £50,000 for Asthma UK. A landmark on the way forward: David was also entranced by the Gettysburg battlefield in Pennsylvania . We never did catch up with Pippa's team, who were riding for another charity, the Michael Matthews Foundation, which campaigns for education for all. They finished almost a full day ahead of us. I know how incredibly hard our cyclists worked, so hats off to Pippa's team. She may have a famous sister and a 'party girl' reputation, but on this occasion she definitely walked the walk... or, more accurately, cycled the cycle, all the way across America.","The Race Across America is a cycle event that crosses the whole country .

"TV star Ben Fogle has spoken for the first time about the heartache of nearly losing his wife during the birth of his stillborn son. According to Mr Fogle, his wife Marina left within 20 minutes of death, as she struggled to give birth to their third child, a son who was stillborn at 32 weeks in August. The thought of losing his wife, with whom he already has two children, as well as their baby was, he revealed, 'terrifying' and 'unbearable'. Scroll down for video . Left: Ben Fogle and wife Marina, whom he nearly lost in August during the birth of their stillborn son; Right: Marina and Ben with their children Ludo, 4, (left) and Iona, 3 (right) 'For her to come within 20 minutes of dying was a huge bolt for me and was so terrifying I can't even explain it. The thought of life without her was unbearable', the 41-year-old   told The Sun newspaper. The presenter also admitted that the harrowing experience was a reminder of the fragility of life and has made him appreciate every moment with his young family - Ludo, four, and Iona, three. He described how the son he never had the pleasure of meeting inspires him and motivates him to ensure his children 'enjoy every moment of their life'. 'There's a little boy we never got to know and if there's anything we owe him in getting so close to having met him, and yet so far, it's to live life even more for him,' he told the newspaper: . The father-of-two says that since the ordeal in August, not a day goes by when he doesn't say 'I love you' to his family and says the experience taught him he to never take life  for granted. The star (right) and with wife Marina (left) said of the experience: 'For her to come within 20 minutes of dying was a huge bolt for me and was so terrifying I can't even explain it. The presenter says his philosophy is now to  smile, be happy and to seize opportunity that he possibly can. Nevertheless, the heart-wrenching experience, which he described as 'a shock in every way', also forced the TV explorer to reevaluate his way of life and seek a simpler existence for his family. In his new series of New Lives In The Wild, which is back on Channel 5 on Friday at 9pm, he meets people who have quit the rat race for alternative lifestyles, something he aspires to himself. Next year, he added, he plans to road test a new way of life for his family life in French Polynesia or Patagonia.

"Three-month-old African pygmiy hedgehog Finn, posing in a cup at owner Emma Crossan's home in Wilpshire, Lancashire . With her brown and white spikes, beady black eyes and small nose, Sabrina the hedgehog is certainly an unusual-looking pet. But her owner, 35-year-old Kirsten Zverina, is besotted. ‘She has a wonderful personality,’ enthuses the project manager from London. ‘She recognises me and smiles when she’s happy. She’s a lovely creature.’ Kirsten, who bought Sabrina for £150 from a breeder in Dorset two years ago, isn’t the only one to fall for the charms of a ‘hedgie’. It’s thought there are now more than 10,000 being kept as pets in the UK. Fans delight in posting photographs of their pets dressed in comical outfits online. Some have even become celebrities. Biddy, a three-year-old hedgehog from Oregon in the U.S., has more than 400,000 followers on Instagram. Another, Norman, has become an internet sensation after his owner posted photographs of the hedgehog skateboarding and taking a bath. He can be recognised by his single white tooth, which protrudes comically from his mouth. So how did the hedgehog become such a popular pet? There’s no doubt they are sweet looking. They rarely grow longer than 11 ins and weigh around 1 lb. The type most people buy as pets — the African Pygmy — is a cross between the White-bellied hedgehog, native to central and eastern Africa, and the Algerian hedgehog. Some are pale, like the snowy Dark Eyed White hedgehog; others, like the Cinnamon Pinto, are cappuccino-coloured. The Chocolate Snowflake Pinto is dark brown. Despite . having up to 6,000 quills each — which protrude when they curl into a . ball — they are surprisingly docile and easy to handle. ‘If they like . you, the spines lie flat and they can be picked up and patted,’ says . Kirsten. ‘They enjoy being cuddled — Sabrina often falls asleep on my . lap in the evenings. When they’re happy, they make little squeaks, which . sound like purring.’ Unlike some cats and dogs, they do not trigger allergies, nor do they give off the strong odour of hamsters or rats. Scroll down for video . Fans of pygmies often post comical pictures of the pets online, with some becoming internet sensations . They are nocturnal, which means that they don’t get lonely if their owners work in the daytime. This isn’t the first time pet hedgehogs have been popular. Children’s author Beatrix Potter had one named Mrs Tiggy-Winkle which inspired her famous story of the same name in 1905. Victorian families often kept hedgehogs in kitchens as a form of pest control, as they eat insects. Today, European Hedgehogs — the type found in the wild in the UK — are protected and it is illegal to have them as pets. African . Pygmies, however, have been kept as pets since they were first brought . into the UK just over a decade ago, after becoming fashionable in the . U.S. in the late Eighties. It is only recently that they have become . hugely popular. Last . week, it was reported that the African Pygmy Hedgehog Registry had seen . a 5 per cent rise in membership in the past six months. Norman, pictured, has become an internet sensation after his owner posted photographs of the hedgehog skateboarding and taking a bath . However, keeping a hedgehog is not something to be taken lightly. While they may suit those working long hours who cannot meet the demands of a dog that needs walking, they are far from low maintenance. They must be kept in a warm environment — above 21 degrees celsius. Metal cages aren’t recommended, as hedgehogs are accomplished climbers and tend to clamber up the metal bars. Give them the run of a room, however, and they may get into difficulties. In 2011, firemen in the West Midlands were called to rescue a hedgehog that had become stuck after climbing onto a high bathroom shelf. The African Pygmy Hedgehog Club, which promotes responsible ownership of hedgehogs in the UK, recommends keeping them in a large vivarium or glass tank. Hedgies are . also vulnerable to health problems. They can suffer from Wobbly . Hedgehog Syndrome, which may sound amusing, but actually has a . devastating effect. This . incurable neurological disease causes the animal to become gradually . paralysed. It is thought that damage to the immune system through . over-breeding could be to blame, since the disease has not affected wild . hedgehogs.It can be fatal. Before she adopted Sabrina, Kirsten owned . another hedgie, named Charlotte, who developed Wobbly Hedgehog Syndrome . and died aged two. Emma Crossan, 24, with her pet pygmies Swarley, left, who is is three months old and Ella, right, who is six months old . Their normal lifespan is between three and eight years. ‘It was terrible,’ says Kirsten. ‘She was like a family member and there was nothing we could do.’ Hedgies have sensitive stomachs and are prone to obesity, which can cause complications, such as fatty liver disease and heart attacks. Helen Dickerson, a 36-year-old volunteer at Animals In Need in Northamptonshire, adopted her pet hedgehog Samson from the National Exotic Hedgehog Rescue Service in November 2012. He had been abandoned by a family who claimed their children ‘didn’t want him any more’ and weighed nearly 2lb — far too much for his 6 in-long frame. ‘I had to put him on a low-fat diet and he was clearly unhappy — he’d roll into a ball and hiss and push his spikes out. It took quite a bit of cuddling and attention before he came round and relaxed,’ she says. Owners are . advised to feed their hedgehogs a mix of low-fat cat foods — mixing . varieties ensures that should one brand be discontinued, the hedgehog’s . stomach won’t be too upset by a sudden change. For a treat, they enjoy . live insects as well as certain cooked foods, such as chicken and boiled . eggs. Kirsten says Sabrina is fond of mint, while Charlotte would lap . up anything sprinkled with coriander. One . way to stop hedgehogs putting on too much weight is to set up a hamster . wheel. They are energetic when given the chance, and can run the . equivalent of more than three miles a night. The type most people buy as pets, the African Pygmy, is a cross between the White-bellied hedgehog, native to central and eastern Africa, and the Algerian hedgehog . The African Pygmy Hedgehog Club, which promotes responsible ownership of hedgehogs in the UK, recommends keeping them in a large vivarium or glass tank . There is, of course, a danger that if hedgies become too popular, then unscrupulous breeders will attempt to cash in on the trend. Dedicated societies such as the African Pygmy Hedgehog Registry and the African Pygmy Hedgehog Club keep lists of approved breeders, but on websites such as Gumtree, hedgehogs are advertised for sale anonymously for up to £200. But many ‘backyard’ breeders don’t understand — or don’t care — that hedgehogs have delicate reproductive systems. Mate a hedgehog younger than six months and it may be unable to care for its young. But if a mother hedgehog is more than a year old when she has her first litter, her  pelvis may have fused, requiring  a Caesarean. Emma Crossan, a 24-year-old breeder from Lancashire, and head of the African Pygmy Hedgehog Club, says: ‘There should be a licensing system in place.’ Hedgehog conservationists warn fraudsters may attempt to catch wild European Hedgehogs to pass off as pets. Hugh Warwick, hedgehog conservationist and author of A Prickly Affair: The Charm Of The Hedgehog, fears such fraud is inevitable. Last week, it was reported that the African Pygmy Hedgehog Registry had seen a five per cent rise in membership in the past six months . He says this would be disastrous for our indigenous hedgehog population, which is already struggling — population figures have plummeted by 37 per cent in the past decade — and leave unsuspecting customers with animals they can’t handle. ‘Wild hedgehogs are very different creatures and are totally inappropriate as pets,’ he says.  Following the similar recent trend for ‘micropigs’, several owners found that rather than buying specially bred miniature pigs, they had been sold baby farm animals. Earlier this year, 46-year-old Donna Davidson was threatened with eviction from her rented home in Leicester after she bought what she believed to be a micropig — only for it to grow into a 21st hog. Animal charities are warning that the sudden popularity of the pygmy hedgehog could lead to people buying them on impulse, then abandoning them. Since the start of 2013, the National Exotic Hedgehog Rescue Service has taken in 89 discarded pygmies. ‘We’re seeing an increase of hogs coming in for various reasons, such as job losses and change of circumstances,’ says Rachel Cookson, who works for the Rescue Service. For devoted hedgie fans such as Emma, Kirsten and Helen, that prospect is heart-breaking. Helen says: ‘People just think, “Oh, aren’t they cute”, and get them on a whim but, in fact, they need a lot of care.’ Nevertheless, she says that, for those prepared to look after their hedgies properly, African Pygmies are a joy: ‘They are amazing creatures. Samson is quirky, funny and unique. He makes me smile every day. He’s gone from being a ball of spikes to part of the family.’","More than 100,000 pygmy hedgehogs are now being kept as pets in the UK .

"An Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear program could trigger a bloody month-long war on multiple fronts, killing hundreds of Israelis or more, the Israeli Cabinet's civil defence chief warned today. It was the most explicit assessment yet of how the government sees events unfolding in the aftermath of an Israeli attack. Matan Vilnai, who is stepping down as the 'home front' Cabinet minister to become Israel's ambassador to China, described the scenarios to Israel's Maariv daily at a time of heightened debate about the Iranian nuclear threat. A threat: Footage from the Iranian state TV channel IRIB, purporting to show a successful test-fire launch of a short range missile . Vilnai, a retired general who was . deputy military chief of staff, has spent the past five years overseeing . upgrades of Israel's civil defence systems, including air-raid sirens, . bomb shelters and a public alert system. In the Maariv interview, Vilnai said . 'the home front is ready as never before'. Nonetheless, he said the . country must be braced for heavy casualties in the case of conflict with . Iran. Vilnai said the government has . prepared for the possibility of hundreds of rockets and missiles falling . on Israeli population centers each day, with the expectation of 500 . deaths. 'It could be that there will be fewer . fatalities, but it could be there will be more. That is the scenario . that we are preparing for according to the best experts,' he said. 'The . assessments are for a war that will last 30 days on a number of fronts.' Israel is convinced that archenemy . Iran is trying to build nuclear weapons, dismissing Tehran's claims that . its nuclear program is for civilian purposes. Israel considers . nuclear-armed Iran to be a mortal danger. Iran backs anti-Israel . militants with funds and weapons, and its leaders often call for . Israel's destruction. In his latest pronouncement, Iranian . Supreme leader Ali Khamenei said Israel will disappear from 'the scene . of geography.' Addressing war veterans in Tehran on Wednesday, he said . Iran considers it its 'religious duty to save this Islamic country . (Palestine) from the clutches of the Zionist occupiers.'

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Israel will disappear from 'the scene of geography' Israel's government has prepared for the possibility of hundreds of rockets and missiles from sites like this in Iran falling on Israeli population centers each day, with the expectation of 500 deaths . Israel's leaders have indicated an attack is a possibility if they conclude the international community has failed to halt the Iranian nuclear program. Mr Vilnai did not elaborate on how he reached his assessments, but his office relies on intelligence and other assessments about Iranian weapons capabilities and Israeli susceptibility. Defence Minister Ehud Barak has also said the Israeli death toll could be in the range of 500 in such a conflict. 'Just as the citizens of Japan have to realise that they can have earthquakes, so the citizens of Israel have to realize that if they live here, they have to be prepared to expect missiles on the home front,' Vilnai said. 'It's not pleasant for the home front, but decisions have to be made, and we have to be ready.' At a news briefing in Washington on Tuesday, Leon Panetta, the U.S. defence secretary, reaffirmed the U.S. assessment that Israel has not yet decided whether to strike, while the U.S. military chief, Gen Martin Dempsey, echoed a widely held assessment that an Israeli operation would only set back, not destroy, Iran's nuclear project.","Speculation is growing that Israel is planning a unilateral attack on Iran .

"Eating fruit and grains is an important step for boosting male fertility . Cutting down on red meat, coffee and alcohol can boost a man's fertility scientists say. A study has discovered that a poor diet and obesity can lower sperm concentration and affect their ability to swim towards an egg. Specialists are now encouraging a diet high in fruit and grains to increase the chances of successful IVF treatment. In the past female fertility problems have been linked to obesity as well . as smoking and drinking, but it hasn't been clear before now if the same . applies to men. But the latest study of men with partners who were undergoing a type of fertility treatment, has revealed that those who regularly drank alcohol and ate poorly were slowed down on the fertility front. Lead researcher Edson Borges, from the Fertility-Assisted Fertilization Center in Sao Paolo said: 'The sperm concentration was negatively . influenced by body mass index (BMI) and alcohol consumption, and was . positively influenced by cereal consumption and the number of meals per . day.' The Brazilian study involved 250 men with partners who were undergoing a type of fertility treatment called . intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Each participant was asked how often they ate a range of foods, including fruits and . vegetables, beans, grains, meat and fish, as well as how much they drank . and smoked. Semen samples were then analysed to . assess sperm health and concentration and each couple were monitored . during the  IVF process. Specialists are now encouraging a diet high in fruit and grains to increase the chances of successful IVF treatment . Eggs were successfully fertilised in . about three-quarters of the treatments, and just under forty per cent of women . got pregnant during the study. From the speed of their sperm to their . partner's chance of pregnancy, men who drank and had a poor diet were less fertile. Lynn Westphal, a women's health . and fertility specialist at Stanford University hopes that the results, published in the Fertility and Sterility journal, will encourage men to make healthier lifestyle choices. 'We talk about having a healthy . lifestyle and trying to eliminate any of these things that are bad for . health, but I think most of the emphasis tends to be on making sure the . woman is as healthy as possible. 'I think this is really interesting data . that lifestyle factors for men, even when you're doing ICSI, are . significant. 'This is probably more of a difference than most people . would have thought.'",Specialists say diet high in fruit and grains increases the chance of successful IVF treatment .
"These poignant last scenes filmed by Lynda Bellingham show her playing a cancer stricken mother opposite her own son. In a moving film, which echoes her own real life experience, the actress weeps as she reveals to her son she has been diagnosed with cancer in Too Close for Comfort 2. In one particularly emotional scene Miss Bellingham, who lost her battle with cancer on October 19, cries for more than a minute as the news of her diagnosis sinks in. Director Donna Taylor revealed that the actress's real-life son Michael Peluso, who played her on-screen child Sam, was on set during the emotional performance and had to leave the room at points. Scroll down for video . Poignant last scenes filmed by Lynda Bellingham show her playing a cancer stricken mother opposite her own son . The actress's real-life son Michael Peluso played her on screen child Sam in Too Close for Comfort 2 . Ms Taylor told the Mirror: 'Lynda was the most wonderful actress but I swear they were real tears. 'Despite putting on a brave face most of the time, she often said there were times at night when she used to get quite scared. And this was that moment. 'Michael couldn't bear the sound of her crying and to see her upset, so he had to go in the other room. He couldn't cope with it. Everyone was crying afterwards.' With echoes of her real life resolve, during the film, a sequel to Too Close to Comfort, Ms Bellingham's character Mary tells Sam that she has cancer but vows to fight on. She says: 'I am not going to die. I am a fighter.' Director Donna Taylor revealed that Mr Peluso was on set during the emotional scenes and had to leave the room at points of his mother's moving performance . In one particularly emotional scene Miss Bellingham, who lost her battle with cancer on October 19, cries for more than a minute . The poignant moment was filmed just weeks after Miss Bellingham had told her son that she was battling cancer in real life and scheduled around her gruelling chemotherapy sessions. Ms Taylor and the late actress had worked together on Too Close for Comfort in 2011 and had wanted to make a sequel together. But after Miss Bellingham was diagnosed with cancer, Ms Taylor said the direction of the film was influenced by her real life battle, writing her fight with the disease into the story line. She said she had hoped that the role would help her psychologically. 'That's why we wrote the character as an upbeat person who would face cancer head on.' Miss Bellingham insisted that some of the proceeds from the low-budget film would go to the charity Action Against Cancer in a bid to raise awareness of the disease. The poignant moment was filmed just weeks after Miss Bellingham had told her son that she was battling cancer in real life and scheduled around her gruelling chemotherapy sessions . The director - who also wrote and starred in the film, about a man's quest to track down his real mother and the consequences it brings - said the upbeat and energetic actress and presenter would offer people cups of tea in between filming, despite them begging her to take it easy. The final scenes of the film were shot in June just two months before Lynda's own cancer had spread to her lungs and liver. Lynda died in her husband Michael’s arms on October 19 at the private London Clinic where she’d received treatment. Her death came just ten days after the publication of her memoirs, There’s Something I’ve Been Dying To Tell You, in which she revealed for the first time she had terminal bowel cancer and spoke about the pleasure of acting opposite her son in the film. She wrote: 'Some of the scenes became very emotional – it was hard enough to play that role but the storyline was all too real for me, it was my life – but it was a joy to work with my son.'","In a moving film, which echoed her own real life experience, the actress weeps as she reveals to her son she has been diagnosed with cancer .

"Kellie Maloney stopped breathing during facial reconstruction surgery and was kept alive on an emergency respirator . Kellie Maloney stopped breathing for more than an hour during facial reconstruction surgery and was kept alive on an emergency respirator, it has been reported. Transsexual Maloney, formerly known as boxing promoter Frank Maloney and who is now 18 months into a transition period to change gender, is believed to have suffered a heart murmur triggered by a reaction to the anaesthetic she was placed under. Maloney, who has three daughters from two marriages, had announced that her final operation was booked for January 13. But The Sun reports that medics have now cancelled the genital and breast surgery to complete her transition, warning that it is too dangerous. A source told the paper: 'She can't go ahead with the sex change now. She's in utter turmoil.' Under NHS guidelines, transsexuals have to live as a woman for two years before they are allowed corrective surgery. Private clinics recommend one year to ensure that their patients can cope with the change. Kellie has already received hormone therapy, hours of hair removal electrolysis, voice coaching and counselling. She was scheduled to have an operation that will involve 'the realignment of her male genitalia to become female genitalia' as well as having breast implants - which doctors said could be up to a B or a C cup. Maloney had travelled to Belgium 11 days ago to undergo facial surgery, but she is said to have had a reaction to the anaesthetic which meant she could not breathe on her own for a number of hours. The operation involved nose augmentation, cheek fillers and an eye-lift. She has since returned home and is said to be recovering with her family in Maidstone, Kent. Before coming out as a transgender female, Kellie was better known as international boxing promoter Frank Maloney, who took Lennox Lewis to become the undisputed Heavyweight Champion of the world. Earlier this year she shocked the macho world of boxing by announcing her decision to change her sex and live as a woman. Ahead of her surgery, Kellie told Lorraine Kelly that she wanted to have her nose made slightly smaller. 'My youngest daughter told me my nostrils were too big,' she said. Kellie Maloney with daughters Sophie, right, and Lilly, left.  Medics have now reportedly cancelled her genital and breast surgery to complete her transition, warning that it is too dangerous . 'I was always concerned about my chin but they tell me it's within the female parameters and the gender doctor can do the full operation, hopefully, and breasts in January.' She added: 'I am living really well now, I am pleased that the public are really good to me and my daughters are great. The operation will be the final piece of the jigsaw, then I can start living my life properly. 'Most of my friends are retiring but I am living life all over again.' Kellie is also sharing her story and supporting others within her support group, talking at events and helping other transgender people. She even revealed that she's toying with the idea of getting back into boxing to prove that women can do it too. 'At least it will stop me shopping,' she joked. MailOnline has contacted Ms Maloney's representatives for comment.","Maloney is now 18 months into a transition period to change gender .

"Surrounded by sleeping pills, anti-depressants and empty bottles of cough syrup,  the bodies of two British newly-weds were found dead in an Indian hotel. Police say James and Alex Gaskell – both teachers with first-class degrees – died of an overdose in their locked room near the Taj Mahal. A guide book, travel bag, mobile phone and other holiday paraphernalia were found on their double bed. Scroll down for video . Old-fashioned romance: The couple in 2012 (left) and smiling at a temple days before their deaths (right) The shocking scene is a stark contrast to the happy image that Mrs Gaskell, 24, had posted a few days earlier of the couple smiling in front of a temple in Delhi. Her 27-year-old husband had posted a series of messages on Twitter outlining his casual attitude to drugs. His final tweet, on Sunday, two days before their bodies were found, said how easy they were to obtain in India. ‘Codeine under the counter here. With Valium, Xanax and Lyrica. Winning,’ he wrote. Earlier he said: ‘One prescription in India (after you have told the doctor what to write) will take you faaaaaar...’ In another post he said: ‘I am absolutely off my face on drugs.’ Tragic waste: Mr Gaskell pictured as a schoolboy . India is a popular destination for drugs tourists keen to acquire powerful prescription medicines from chemists, with few questions asked. It is unclear whether the couple died from an overdose of prescription drugs or from another substance. Although Mr Gaskell made no secret of his craving for pills, relatives of his wife insisted yesterday she was anti-drugs. The couple, who married last November, were found dead in the Hotel Maya in Agra. As well as strips of coloured capsules, police discovered a prescription for the anti-anxiety drug diazepam. Mr Gaskell was found lying on his side while his wife was slumped in a crouched position. There was evidence in the room that one or both of them had been sick. Rajesh Gupta, who owns the hotel which is a popular haunt for backpackers, said the couple checked in on Monday night. He said: ‘Later they ordered the dinner at 9pm and by 10pm our room service went with dinner. He knocked on the door and James Gaskell opened the door and took the dinner – he didn’t allow our employee inside the room and closed the door. ‘They booked only for one night and were supposed to inform us about an extended stay. ‘When they didn’t come down, our hotel staff knocked their door at 11:30 am on Tuesday, but there was no response and door was locked inside. He informed the manager quickly who later informed the police. ‘Later police arrived and found that both were dead on the bed. Both the television and air conditioner were on. Died: James Gaskell, 27, and his wife Alexandra, 24, pictured together in India just weeks before their death . Drugs paraphernalia: Police found these strips of tablets - thought to be sleeping pills and anti-depressants - next to the couple's bodies on the bed in their hotel room along with bottles cough syrup (not pictured) ‘Police found five empty bottles of cough syrup, strips of sleeping pills, anti-depressants and a medical prescription from the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in Delhi, mentioning a drug called diazepam – used to treat anxiety disorders.’ Shalabh Mathur, who is a police chief in Agra, said: ‘From the prescription, it appears that the woman had some sort of headache. ‘A lot of anti-depressants, pain killers and other medicines were found in the room . ‘There were no apparent signs of any struggle or forced entry into the room. We have looked at all possible scenarios and it looks like a case of a drug overdose.’ Ish Anand, the Delhi doctor who prescribed Mr Gaskell the diazepam, said: ‘He said he’d been on the medicine for a long time and he had come to me for a repeat prescription. He was addicted to these pills so it’s not safe to come off them immediately, he has to come off them slowly. So I gave him a different dose as a repeat prescription. ‘You need to slowly reduce your intake, it is very serious if you stop taking them immediately, so I felt it reasonable to give him another prescription. Travelling: The couple, both teachers, arrived in the country in July before visiting Agra in early October . Clues: Police forensics officers gather evidence from the hotel room where the couple were found dead . India is seen as a honey-pot for so-called drugs tourists because of the easy availability of prescription medicine. On social media, James Gaskell made it clear – even before he left Britain for India – that he was aware drugs would be more easy to obtain there. Both prescription and over-the-counter drugs in India have come under increasing scrutiny this year, amid claims over safety lapses, falsified drug test results and the sale of fake medicines. Earlier this year, a UN report warned that prescription drug abuse was on the rise in India – with medicines being mixed with dangerous substances. Drugs enter the region’s illicit markets through various channels, being diverted from India’s pharmaceutical industry and smuggled from Afghanistan, the report said. ‘Prescription drug abuse is growing in India,’ the report added. Concerns over India’s over-the-counter and prescription drugs have been expressed by US regulators. Margaret A Hamburg, of the Food and Drug Administration, visited India in February to express her growing unease with the safety of Indian medicines because of ‘recent lapses in quality at a handful of pharmaceutical firms’. India’s pharmaceutical industry supplies 40 per cent of over-the-counter and generic prescription drugs consumed in the US. ‘He seemed stable, calm, alert and walked well. It was a medicine that I just continued to give him; it wasn’t a new prescription. He was very well informed about the medicine and I felt he knew what he was doing.’ Mrs Gaskell’s stepfather Greg Pike told the Mail that her husband took drugs to treat depression. ‘This wasn’t two young people on a drug-fuelled trip around India,’ he insisted. ‘They went to there to experience the Indian way of life and the culture. ‘Alex has always been very wary of drugs and drug culture. She just wasn’t interested.’ The 67-year-old architect added: ‘James was a very intense young guy. He had really strong views about social injustice and there were a lot of things in the world he was unhappy about. He was like a student from the 60s. ‘It’s no secret that James had bouts of depression. That maybe came from all the things that he had going around in his head. I know he had taken anti-depressants while out in India.’ Mr Pike, of Marple Bridge, Cheshire said: ‘They had been planning the trip to India for some time and we were surprised when they decided to get married first. It seemed an old-fashioned idea.’ The couple both taught languages at Manchester International College and wanted to teach English abroad on an extended work-holiday that would take in Indonesia. ‘It wasn’t just a holiday, they planned to be away for some time,’ said Mr Pike. Mrs Gaskell’s mother, Anna-Louise, 46, was said to be too upset to speak last night. Mr Gaskell’s mother Ann Palmer, who runs a consultancy business, refused to comment at her home near Sevenoaks in Kent. His father Phil, who lives in Wilmslow, Cheshire, posted on Facebook: ‘I can’t understand how I should feel at the moment, my mind is blank. Just very sad.’ Family member Diane Gaskell said on Facebook – beneath a picture of James as a schoolboy: ‘He was a cutie, and when I see him and Alex at their wedding reception never in a million years would I have dreamed this would happen.

"A wealthy businessman is being sued by his former secretary who claims she was forced to view e-mails containing pornographic photographs of strangers and even naked pictures of the man’s wife. The $4 million legal action has been filed against Bill Berkman, a managing partner in the private equity firm Associated Partners, by his former executive assistant Nancy Woods. According to the lawsuit filed in Manhattan’s Federal District Court she claims her job forced her ‘to review offensive, lewd e-mails and attachments which subjects were naked or scantily clad women’. Wealthy New York businessman Bill Berkman, left, is being sued by his former secretary who claims she was forced to view e-mails containing pornographic photographs of strangers and naked pictures of his wife Ronit Golan Berkman, right . She claims Berkman emailed these photos to his friend Gerald Cardinale, the former head of Goldman Sachs’ private-equity business, who in 2007 helped Alex Rodriguez negotiate a new $275 million contract with the New York Yankees. According to Wood's suit, e-mails between Berkman and Cardinale included ‘inappropriate pictures of random and unsuspecting women on the street from a favorite bench shared by Berkman and Cardinale, from the subway and from the East Hampton seaplane.’ The New York Post reports that photos in the lawsuit appear to been taken without the women’s knowledge and included young women in short skirts in Soho. One e-mail sent from Berkman to Cardinale allegedly included an image of wife Ronit Golan Berkman’s bottom along with the text, ‘Ronit in a bikini from our trip in Cabo.’ In her $4 million lawsuit, former executive assistant Nancy Woods, above, claims she was forced her 'to review offensive, lewd e-mails and attachments which subjects were naked or scantily clad women' Cardinale is alleged to have sent Berkman an email containing a nude photo of actress Lake Bell and a message that read, 'You need to take photos of Ronit in these poses... tonite!!' The lawsuit also claims that Berkman 'regularly sends pornographic material he maintains at Wickr, Top Secret Messenger.' Mail Online has reached out to Berkman for comment on the lawsuit. An attorney for Berkman told the Post: ‘Ms. Woods has worked for the company for six years. She was aware her employment was about to be terminated, and we believe she filed this lawsuit to retaliate against and embarrass her employer. ‘The referenced e-mails were personal ones between friends, which Ms. Woods should not have reviewed. Her claims are without merit and will be vigorously defended against.’ Associated Partners' managers, brothers David and Bill Berkman, are the scions of a Pittsburgh family that made a fortune in communications. The family business started selling greeting cards and went on to own radio and TV stations and eventually operate and sell off early cellular networks.

"Young girls are fast becoming internet sensations not because of their vocal skills or dance moves, but because they resemble living dolls. Staring doe-eyed at the camera, with cupids bow lips and a porcelain complexion Dakota Rose has been hailed a real-life Barbie. Known to her fans as Kota Koti, she has amassed a global audience with her YouTube fashion and beauty tutorials. Scroll down for video . Dakota Rose is being hailed as the real-life Barbie for her doll-like features . In most of the videos she remains silent while subtitles provide the viewer with a step-by-step guide on how to apply . cosmetics, style hair or dress fashionably. 'I usually prefer something lighter. I would only wear this to a club, night time event,' she writes below a 6 minute video demonstrating how to apply 'nighttime eye make up'. It is said that Dakota is especially popular across Asia as her sense of style appears to be inspired by the Japanese anime culture, in which big eyes and long straight hair are key features. Little is known about the teenager but some websites suggest she is aged between 16 and 18 and from the west coast of America. Despite her growing success, some commentators have warned that she could encourage the sexualisation of children. Venus Palermo, known online as Venus Angelic, has also gained popularity for resembling a living doll . Venus Palermo has 78 videos on her official YouTube page - ranging from makeup tutorials to nail art . A Bolivian newspaper, Opinion.com.bo reported: 'Thousands of girls around the world have shown interest in this girl, wanting to look like her. 'It is a great risk that girls are being influenced in this way.' Experts have also expressed their concern. Dr Gray, clinical director at The British CBT & Counselling Service (www.thebritishcbtcounsellingservice.co.uk) warned that too much emphasis on physical appearance from an early age could have 'disastrous consequences', encouraging anxiety, depression and eating disorders later in life. She told MailOnline: 'At any age placing too much value on physical appearance can be potentially detrimental to a person’s self esteem and sense of self worth. 'Equally concerning is why these images have been created and for what purpose. 'Distorting or enhancing pictures of children so that they appear older and more sexual surely crosses the line between how we should treat the children in our society and how we should not.' But Dakota is not the only one to have fashioned herself as a living Barbie. Venus Palermo, known online as Venus Angelic, is a 15-year-old girl who has also taken to the internet detailing how to look like a living doll. After spending time in Japan and inspired by the craze for Japanese anime she decided to give her image an overhaul on her return to London two years ago. She now has 78 videos on her official YouTube page - ranging from makeup tutorials and nail art to dancing and her Facebook page boasts over 13,000 fans.

Despite critics her mother approves: 'She actually thinks it's cute to wear cute and frilly clothes.' While Venus said. 'I don't think that I will ever stop. I think I will grow in my style and just keep doing what I love.' While the living doll-look is going global, in Asia it has been a long-running trend. As early as 2010 it was reported that an increasing amount of Japanese women were aspiring to look like dolls, embracing femininity and obliterating sexuality altogether. Naoko Kamijyo, then 19, told the New York Times: 'I’m no great beauty, but I love to be made up. I want to change myself, to be unrecognizable. Who wants to go through life just being themselves?' She reportedly woke up at 5am every morning, spending at least two hours applying false eyelashes, false hair extensions, layers of foundation and other makeup products in a bid to look like a Barbie doll. A recent poll in Taiwan of 13,000 students revealed nearly half started surfing the internet before the age of seven, and some start as young as three. It found a correlation between the frequency of online social networking and the level of concern with appearance and self-image.

"A vegan mom whose newborn son was taken into care for five months after she refused to take him to hospital for weight treatment has revealed the moment he was taken away by cops. Sarah Markham, from Florida, was finally allowed to care for her son Caleb last week following a judge's orders, although she still faces child neglect charges. Caleb was taken into care in June when, instead of following a doctor's orders to take him to an emergency room, Markham decided to try supplementing her breast milk with a vegan formula. Separated: Sarah Markham whose newborn son was taken into care for five months after his diet left him dehydrated, has spoken of the moment he was taken away . Charges? The new mother was finally reunited with her son Caleb last week, although she still has an arraignment scheduled for this week . Reunited: Caleb was taken into care in June when, instead of following a doctor's orders to take him to an emergency room, Ms Markham decided to try supplementing her breast milk with a vegan formula . 'Caleb was losing some weight so I had some concerns that I was only breastfeeding and that is when they said we needed to supplement,' she told Today. 'Instead of taking him to the hospital I went and got the formula,' she said. Markham's doctor then reported the new mother to Child Protective Services - she was arrested for child neglect and 12-day-old Caleb was away and given to her parents. Police had to call a locksmith to get into her home. Victory: Markham regained custody of her child last week after he was taken away because she wanted to supplement her breast milk with a soy formula . Healthy: 'He's still on a soy formula – he's been on it, he likes it, he's doing well. He's growing healthy, and I can't ask for anything more,' Markham said outside the courtroom . Defensive: Caleb's grandfather, who has been caring for the boy, has said there is absolutely no child abuse in this case and that his daughter is a fit mother . An arrest report says Markham was 'argumentative' and 'defensive at times' and did not have a 'sense of urgency'. Markham's lawyer Mark O'Mara does admit that the infant 'was, in fact, having trouble gaining weight,' but writes, 'Sarah believes the doctor would NOT have recommended she go to the hospital if she hadn't challenged him by asking for an alternative.' After her arrest, he adds, the newborn was taken to the hospital and fed the vegan formula by those caring for him, 'and that's all they did for the baby.' But Markham insists she was acting with her son's best interests at heart. Growing: Caleb, pictured here just days after being born, is now  a healthy 17 pounds and is back in his mother's custody where he still consumes a vegan baby formula . 'As a new mom you have this wonderful joy when you are pregnant, you want to meet the the little person inside for the first time and you want them to see you as the protector, you are mommy,' she said. Last week the judge decided that Markham was not an unfit mother and said she could have him back if she promises to meet with a nutritionist. Markham, who has a degree in health science, agreed to visit a nutritionist but said her son, who had lost 10 per cent of his body weight, is still on a soy formula. Arrested: Sarah Markham in a mug shot after her arrest . 'He's still on a soy formula – he's been on it, he likes it, he's doing well. He's growing healthy, and I can't ask for anything more,' Markham said. 'There's no case, there's no abuse, there's no neglect, there's simply a doctor who has been challenged by a mother and he didn't like it,' grandfather Bo Markham told WFTV. Caleb now weighs 17 pounds and has been taken care of by his grandparents who believe their daughter is a fit mother. Last Wednesday's case was for the sole purpose of regaining custody but Markham  still faces criminal charges that her lawyer is confident a judge will dismiss as well. 'My hope is that they'll simply dismiss it and not go forward on this at all,' Mark O'Mara said. Markham is a Christian Seventh-day Adventist and holistic healing and a vegan diet is in her system of beliefs. Because of her choice not to take her son to the hospital, Markham  was only allowed to see her son during supervised visits and only a few times a week, according to Seminole County Child Protective Services. 'They've kept a child away from a mom,' said attorney Mark O'Mara to WFTV. 'My client can only see her child once a week or twice a week because they're requiring the child be out of the county,' he said prior to Markham regaining custody. O'Mara said that Markham's parenting was 'not even close' to child neglect. Healthy: Markham's now healthy baby had lost 10 per cent of his body weight and doctors told her to take the baby to the hospital but she tried giving him a vegan baby formula instead . Markham is a Christian Seventh-day Adventist and holistic healing and a vegan diet, even for her child,  is in her system of beliefs. Pictured: Markham, her son and the baby's father . 'It's absurd. It's a mom trying to do the best she can, acting as a vegan which she has the entire right to do taking care of her child,' he said. Markham's son is now healthy and she is happy to have him home. 'She has done everything they've asked her to do: Mental health evaluations, drug evaluations, parenting classes, everything they've asked her to do she's done, and she's done it very well, and yet we have to go to trial on this tomorrow. It's absurd,' said O'Mara before winning the custody battle.","Sarah Markham, from Florida, lost her son Caleb 12 days after he was born .

"The Downing Street Plebgate row took a sensational turn last night after a police constable said the former Tory Minister he claims called him a ‘f****** pleb’ must pay him up to £200,000 damages, and be gagged from speaking out. PC Toby Rowland, who claims he was abused by former Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell when he refused to let him cycle through the Downing Street gates, has tabled his astonishing demands in court documents obtained by The Mail on Sunday. Speaking out for the first time since the incident in 2012, the police officer insists Mr Mitchell DID use the term ‘f****** plebs’ – and in a dramatic twist, implies Mr Mitchell apologised for using the words. Court claims: PC Toby Rowland, left, intends to launch a £200,000 libel suit against former Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell, right, claiming that he called him a 'f****** pleb' when he asked for the gates of Downing Street to be opened for him in September 2012 . He says Mr Mitchell phoned him to say sorry afterwards ‘with the clear implication he admitted using the said words’ – but later repeatedly lied about it to try to save his career. It is the first time anyone has suggested Mr Mitchell owned up to calling No 10 police ‘f****** plebs’. The former Minister, who was forced to resign from the Cabinet as a result, has already stated that he rang PC Rowland to apologise for ‘using Anglo-Saxon language’. But he has never admitted he called him a ‘f****** pleb’. Now PC Rowland is demanding up to £200,000 in ‘aggravated damages for slander’ and has asked the court to grant an injunction to ‘restrain’ Mr Mitchell, and anyone acting on his behalf, from repeating his claim that Rowland fabricated the allegation. As he fought to clear his name Mr Mitchell has been aided by Tory MP David Davis and senior Labour figures such as Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee. PC . Rowland’s request for an injunction would appear to extend to them and . would mean they would also be silenced by court order. Both . Mr Davis and Mr Vaz would almost certainly refuse. In theory, the gag . could apply to Mr Mitchell’s wife, Sharon, a family doctor who has . vigorously defended her husband. Conversely there are those who believe that Mr Mitchell’s ability to call on the help of friends in  high places has given him an unfair advantage in his battle with PC Rowland. The bombshell new claims are contained in a statement of more than 10,000 words by PC Rowland to the High Court, setting out his libel claim against Mr Mitchell. It says PC Rowland wants ‘damages including aggravated damages for libel, and if appropriate, slander’. He also wants ‘an injunction to restrain [Mitchell] whether by himself, his servants, agents or otherwise howsoever, from further publishing or causing the publication of the same or similar words defamatory to the claimant.’ The controversial nature of parts of his statement are bound to raise the temperature in the breakdown in police relations with the Government as a result of Plebgate. One policeman has been jailed for falsely claiming he witnessed the incident, three others face Metropolitan Police disciplinary hearings this week over other misconduct allegations. And the Police Federation has been accused of using Plebgate to undermine the Government’s attempts to reform the police. PC Rowland’s counter claims against Mr Mitchell, his demand for up to £200,000, and a gag on an MP, could further inflame tensions. The stakes could not be higher: PC Rowland claims Mr Mitchell falsely accused him of ‘dishonesty and corruption’ and ‘humiliated’ him. David Cameron is keen to restore Mr Mitchell to the Cabinet – but he has no chance of doing that if he loses the libel case to PC Rowland. The former International Development Minister last night stood by his claim that he never said ‘f****** plebs’. He told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I have always made clear that the police account of what happened that night is untrue. Thanks to good investigative journalism much of the truth has already come out. ‘There are ten police officers facing some form of misconduct inquiries for what they did and one has gone to jail, with three gross misconduct hearings taking place in London, starting tomorrow. My legal defence to these allegations will be filed shortly.’ PC Rowland says he wrote down Mr Mitchell’s ‘f****** plebs’ alleged comment in his notebook 90 minutes after the event and immediately emailed it to senior officers. Rowland also says: . Until now, PC Rowland, 43, has not uttered a word in public since the incident 19 months ago. Rowland’s lawyer Des Browne QC states: ‘The claimant (Rowland) cannot say how much he expects to recover, save that he does not expect the amount in damages to exceed £200,000.’ Rowland’s ‘statement of claims’ filed to the court, declares: ‘On the evening of 19 September the claimant, on duty in Downing St, declined to open the main gate to allow the defendant to pass through with his bicycle, explaining it would be against security policy. ‘The claimant opened the pedestrian side gate for the claimant. The defendant said to the claimant: “Best learn your f****** place – you don’t run this f****** government, you’re f****** plebs.”’ The alleged comments were leaked to the Press and Mr Mitchell was forced to resign as International Development Secretary. But he claimed he did not utter the ‘toxic phrase’, joked about PC Rowland’s ‘alleged logbook’ and said he was the victim of a police ‘stitch up’. PC Rowland says it meant Mr Mitchell had accused him of ‘fabricating the damning allegation that [Mitchell] had called Rowland and/or police “f****** plebs” ’. Justifying his demand for up to £200,000 damages, Rowland’s lawyer declares: ‘He has been very seriously injured in his personal and professional reputation and suffered great distress, humiliation and upset.’ Mr Mitchell’s allegations ‘could not be more serious for a serving officer, let along one engaged in protecting members of the Government. The impact on his career could be devastating.’ Mitchell was ‘well aware how serious it was to make such allegations... he knew were baseless’. PC Rowland says: ‘Initially [Mitchell] did not allege [Rowland] had lied. In fact he apologised [to Rowland] privately by phone not long after the incident. ‘The clear implication was that he admitted to using the said words.’ Mr Davis said last night: ‘The idea a policeman can ask for £200,000 damages from an elected Member of Parliament, ask a judge to gag them and to gag any other MPs or friends and relatives who wish to speak up freely for them, undermines the very democracy the police are supposed to safeguard.’ Andrew Mitchell’s claim that he is the victim of an orchestrated police smear campaign will receive a boost this week when three officers face gross misconduct hearings over their role in the saga. The cases have been brought as a result of Operation Alice, the Scotland Yard investigation into Plebgate. Two officers have already lost their jobs as a result: PC Keith Wallis, who was sacked from the force and sentenced to 12 months in prison for fabricating a witness statement purporting to be from a member of the public; and PC James Glanville, who was fired for leaking PC Rowland’s ‘f****** plebs’ version of events to The Sun. Now two women and one man, all from the Diplomatic Protection Group, face the prospect of further disciplinary action. The first hearing, tomorrow, is for an unnamed constable accused of forwarding PC Rowland’s log to Glanville. Two further hearings will be held for a PC accused of falsely claiming not to have been in contact with Wallis, and for a constable accused of giving false statements to Operation Alice. Both women have been suspended from duty, while the male officer has been on restricted duties. The fake email sent by Wallis to John Randall MP, the Government’s Deputy Chief Whip, proved fatal to Mr Mitchell’s career because it appeared to offer independent corroboration of the police log version of events. It purported to come from a member of the public present outside the gates, and claimed that the incident had been witnessed by other tourists. David Cameron rang Mr Mitchell after reading the email and told him to quit the Cabinet. Mr Mitchell has said that the emergence of the email was ‘the worst moment of my life’, adding: ‘Suddenly I realised I was being stitched up. I knew . it was false but I didn’t know what to do. I realised something terrible was happening to me over which I had no control.’ Mr Mitchell was given the nickname ‘Thrasher’ at school, and some say his reputation for high-handedness was why not all Tory MPs immediately rowed in behind him when the controversy broke. One said: ‘Andrew can have quite an off-hand manner about him at times.’ Mr Mitchell has continuously maintained he is the victim of a smear campaign. ‘If this can happen to a senior Government Minister, then what chance would a youth in Brixton or Handsworth have?’ he has said. Mr Mitchell admitted swearing ‘in exasperation’ but always denied losing his temper. Central to Mr Mitchell’s argument is CC TV footage, released in December 2012, which cast doubt on the police account by showing only a brief interaction between Mitchell and the officer – and no tourists. He received a further boost in October 2013 after a report from the Independent Police Complaints Commission concluded three officers had given a false account of a meeting they had with Mitchell at his constituency office in October 2012, and that the findings of a subsequent investigation had been changed at the 11th hour to recommend no disciplinary action be taken. That prompted Mr Cameron to call for Mr Mitchell to receive an apology over the incident. The officers issued a statement in which they apologised for misleading the public.

"Chat and messaging apps could be the downfall of Facebook, experts claimed today. The huge rise of apps such as Whatsapp, Kik and Wechat among teens could cause major problems for Facebook, they say. The key is teenagers - who say apps are 'blowing up' among their friends, rather than Mark Zuckerberg's established networking giant. Teenagers are increasingly turning to chat apps to share pictures, researchers say - and it could spell trouble for Facebook . Combining elements of text messaging and . social networking, the apps allow photos, music and video to be easily shared. Waterloo, Ontario-based Kik has racked up 40 million users since launching in 2010. Silicon Valley entrants in the race . include Whatsapp, funded by Sequoia Capital, and MessageMe, launched . earlier this month by a group of viral game makers. MessageMe has received seed-stage . funding from True Ventures and First Round Capital, among others, and . claimed 1 million downloads in its first week. Meanwhile, Asian companies are producing some of the fastest-growing apps in history. Tencent's WeChat boasts 400 million . users - far more than Twitter, by way of comparison - while LINE and . KakaoTalk claim 120 million and 80 million users, respectively. The apps even offer similar features, allowing users to create personal profiles, build networks of friends and share photos, videos and music. That might sound precisely like Facebook, but hundreds of millions of tech-savvy young people have instead turned to a wave of smartphone-based messaging apps that are now sweeping across North America, Asia and Europe. The hot apps include Kik and Whatsapp, both products of North American startups, as well as Kakao Inc's KakaoTalk, NHN Corp's LINE and Tencent Holdings Ltd's WeChat, which have blossomed in Asian markets. Combining elements of text messaging and social networking, the apps provide a quick-fire way for smartphone users to trade everything from brief texts to flirtatious pictures to YouTube clips — bypassing both the SMS plans offered by wireless carriers and established social networks originally designed as websites. Facebook Inc, with 1 billion users, remains by far the world's most popular website, and its stepped-up focus on mobile has made it the most-used smartphone app as well. Still, across Silicon Valley, investors and industry insiders say there is a possibility that the messaging apps could threaten Facebook's dominance over the next few years. The larger ones are even starting to emerge as full-blown 'platforms' that can support third-party applications such as games. To be sure, many of those who are using the new messaging apps remain on Facebook, indicating there is little immediate sign of the giant social media company losing its lock on the market. And at a press event this week, the company will unveil news relating to Android, the world's most popular smartphone operating system, which could include a new version of Android with deeper integration of Facebook messaging tools - or possibly even a Facebook-branded phone. But the firms that can take over the messaging world should be able to make some big inroads, investors say. 'True interactions are conversational in nature,' says Rich Miner, a partner at Google Ventures who invested in San Francisco-based MessageMe, a new entrant in the messaging market. The WhatsApp app, which bypasses traditional social networks and allows teens to chat directly with each other, even sharing pictures, music and video . 'More people text and make phone calls than get on to social networks. If one company dominates the replacement of that traffic, then by definition that's very big.' Facebook spokespeople declined to comment for this article, citing this Thursday's planned announcement. Facebook's big challenge is reeling back users like Jacob Robinson, a 15-year old high school student in Newcastle upon Tyne in the U.K., who said the Kik messaging app 'blew up' among his friends about six months ago. It has remained the most-used app on his Android phone because it is the easiest way for him to send different kinds of multimedia for free, which he estimated he does about 200 times a day. Robinson said he trades snapshots of his homework with friends while they stay up late studying for their exams — or not. 'We also stay up in bed with our phone all night, just on YouTube searching for funny videos, then you quickly share it with your friends,' he added. 'It's easy. You can flip in and out of Kik.' Facebook 'has really started to lose its edge over here,' said Robinson, who found his interactions on Facebook less interesting than his real-time chats. Waterloo, Ontario-based Kik has racked up 40 million users since launching in 2010. Silicon Valley entrants in the race include Whatsapp, funded by Sequoia Capital, and MessageMe, launched earlier this month by a group of viral game makers. MessageMe has received seed-stage funding from True Ventures and First Round Capital, among others, and claimed 1 million downloads in its first week. Meanwhile, Asian companies are producing some of the fastest-growing apps in history. Tencent's WeChat boasts 400 million users - far more than Twitter, by way of comparison - while LINE and KakaoTalk claim 120 million and 80 million users, respectively. Both have laid the groundwork to expand into the U.S. market. The growth in the messaging apps reflect the dramatic shift in Internet usage in recent years, as Web visits via desktop computers have stagnated while smartphone ownership and app downloads have skyrocketed. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has publicly called Facebook a 'mobile company' to emphasize the company's priorities. Waterloo, Ontario-based Kik has racked up 40 million users since launching in 2010 . Last year, he splashed $1 billion for photo-sharing app Instagram, which has remained red hot, while Facebook also launched its own Messenger app, offering a suite of smartphone communication tools. Still, Facebook has also been forced to play defense. Earlier this year, the company cut off its data integration with a young startup called Snapchat and then mimicked its feature with a new messaging tool called Poke, which sends messages that self-destruct. It has also shut off its integration with messaging apps like MessageMe and Voxer. At the same time, Facebook has also hired graphic artists to draw emoticons and graphics for Messenger that emulate features of the wildly popular Asian apps like LINE, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Path limits the number of people you can friend . Dave Morin, an early Facebook . employee who left to found the 'private' social network Path in 2010, . said he recognized last summer the critical role of messaging functions . in smartphone apps, and quickly began working to incorporate them. Since . Path released a new version of its app earlier this month, the number . of Path's daily users has risen 15 percent, which Morin attributed to . the new messaging features. 'What's . the number one reason why people have this thing?' said Morin, holding . up his iPhone. 'It's to call, to text, to communicate.' Messaging, Morin added, is 'the basis for the mobile social network.' Launched in November of 2010, Path has grown to include over five million people sharing life with close friends and family all over the world. The company is headquartered in downtown San Francisco. However, unlike Facebook and Twitter, Path is billed as an intensely private experience aimed at your real friends. There’s a 150-friend limit on the service, although most never reach that.The upside is that it seems to be used a lot more — there is none of the worry of your boss seeing your terrible holiday photos, and the gorgeous-looking app is also simple to use. 'People have this deep desire to remember things, to remember their lives. 'It’s a source of real happiness for people,' founder Dave Morin told the Evening Standard. 'It’s the participation of your friends and family in the story that’s exciting.' While established social networks move to incorporate messaging features, the new-wave messaging apps are looking to grow into social networking platforms that support a variety of features and enable innovations from outside developers. 'The tried and true approach for a social network is first you build a network, then you build apps on your own, then you open it up to third party developers,' said Charles Hudson, a partner at early stage venture capital firm SoftTech VC. The moves mirror Facebook's younger days, when its user growth and revenues were boosted by game publishers like Zynga Inc, which made popular games like FarmVille for the Facebook platform. In the South Korean market, for instance, eight of the top ten highest grossing Android apps are games built on top of KakaoTalk. Tencent announced in November that it would introduce a mobile wallet feature enabling payment for goods with WeChat. And Tencent also makes money in China by using the app's location data to displaying nearby merchants' deals to potential customers. If the messaging apps reach a certain scale, they could form networks that rival Facebook's 'social graph,' the network of user connections and activities that enable highly targeted delivery of content and advertising. 'The folks on your address book are very different from your Facebook friends and your LinkedIn contacts, and that's a natural place for a very powerful graph to be created,' said Jim Goetz, a partner at Sequoia Capital. Teens are increasingly turning to apps rather than traditional social networks . Ted Livingston, the 25-year old chief executive of Kik, said he developed the capability for his service to support external features in November, and he plans to open the platform to outside developers in the near future. Livingston said Kik and Whatsapp were 'in a race to see who's the first to build a platform.' Whatsapp, which has been the most widely downloaded communication app for both iOS and Android in recent months, according to analysis firm App Annie, has been profitable by selling subscriptions to its service for $1 a year. Although it has remained mum about its platform plans, the company has been rumored to be in talks with Asian game publishers about hosting games, according to news reports in South Korea. Goetz declined to address the reports, saying only that because it relied on a subscription business model, Whatsapp did not need to sell games or ads to make money. Still, he said, the Whatsapp team 'spends a lot of time thinking about the developer community.'","Experts say teenagers are increasingly turning to messaging apps instead of Facebook .

"Fish-oil supplements credited with a range of health benefits could trigger prostate cancer. Experts found that omega-3 fatty acids may raise the risk of the most lethal form of the disease by more than 70 per cent. Researchers warned against omega-3 pills, and recommended eating just one or two meals of oily fish per week. Fish-oil supplements are said to protect against heart attacks and strokes, stave off arthritis, boost brain power and prevent behaviour disorders in children. Taking omega-3 fatty acids, derived from fish oils, can increase a man's risk of high-grade prostate cancer by 71 per cent . However, scientists found that those with the highest levels of omega-3 in their blood were 71 per cent more likely to develop fast-growing, hard-to-treat prostate tumours. They were also more likely to contract the slower, less deadly form of the disease, with the overall prostate cancer risk raised by 43 per cent. The team from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre in Seattle warned: ‘There is really no evidence that taking dietary supplements is beneficial to health, and there is increasing evidence that taking high doses is harmful.’ Dr Alan Kristal said the levels of omega-3 linked to the increased cancer risk would be reached by taking just one supplement a day, or three or four meals of fish such as salmon and mackerel each week. Of mealtimes, he said: ‘There are good things in fish, so the message is moderation. It is probably not bad for you, and it tastes good.’ Taking omega-3 was also associated with a 44 per cent greater chance of developing low-grade prostate cancer . However, he stressed that when compared to fatty acids received by eating oily fish, the amount consumed via pills was ‘huge’. It is unclear how fish oil could trigger tumours, but omega-3 may restrict the immune system, or damage our DNA. It is also unclear if it helps tumours to grow and spread. The finding came amid a wider research project of more than 2,000 men, examining whether supplements of vitamin E and the mineral selenium can help prevent prostate cancer – the most common cancer in British men, killing more than 10,000. Selenium provided no benefit, and vitamin E increased the odds of contracting the disease. Dr Kristal said: ‘As we do more and more of these studies – and I have been involved in them most of my career – we find high doses of supplements have no effect or increase the risk of the disease you are trying to prevent. ‘There is not really a single example of where taking a supplement lowers chronic disease risk.’ Professor Malcolm Mason, of Cancer Research UK, said: ‘The results of this study are surprising, and we clearly need more research to understand what is behind them.’ Although he stressed the researchers could not be certain whether the study’s participants ate oily fish or took omega-3 supplements, he said the results ‘show how complex the effects of food supplements might be’. Dr Iain Frame of Prostate Cancer UK agreed that ‘larger and more complex studies will need to take place before we understand how the risks of a diet high in omega-3 balance against [its] benefits’. Several recent studies have called omega-3’s benefits to the heart into question, too. One, which examined 20 studies involving almost 70,000 people, found that those who took omega-3 were no less likely to die of a heart attack or stroke than others .","Supplement was also increased low-grade prostate cancer risk by 44% .

"Baz Luhrmann's big-screen adaptation of The Great Gatsby this year brought the glamour of jazz age America gloriously to life. Audiences were dazzled by the bright lights of New York and the palatial mansions of Long Island. However, as these pictures demonstrate, much of what was shown was pure cinematic trickery. They reveal how, with help from modern technology, a few cars and a group of actors were translated into a teeming metropolitan scene, and how an almost empty field became a sumptuous formal garden. The stills, released by visual effect supervisor Chris Godfrey, reveal that many of the movie’s most spectacular scenes were, in fact, shot with nothing but a series of blue and green screens in the background. Taxi to nowhere: Bustling Broadway was actually created with just a few green screens and less than a dozen cars . Talking to himself: Gatsby, played by Leonardo Di Caprio, is seen with friend Nick Carraway, played by Tobey Maguire, in front of Long Island Sound - but in reality it was little more than a blue screen . The vanishing mansion: The horseman is real enough, but the sumptuous estate and perfectly manicured gardens are a CGI sleight of hand . The technique — known as chroma key — is used in TV weather reports to create the illusion of the forecaster standing before an animated map, which is then overlaid on the screen. Today, thanks to innovations in computer-generated imagery (CGI), backdrops can be created from scratch with the help of 3D modelling programmes similar to those used by architects designing a building. Impressive as it may be, the method is not without its flaws. Shooting before a screen means that actors must avoid wearing clothes that match it, because everything of that colour will automatically be replaced by background footage. For all that, chroma key allows directors to take their audiences on dazzling flights of fancy. Indeed, those who have seen the new film version of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel (there was a 1974 version with Robert Redford) would struggle to guess that most of The Great Gatsby was shot not in New York State, where Fitzgerald’s tale is set, but in Luhrmann’s native Sydney. All that jazz: A car full of revellers on the Queensboro Bridge was seen in the film... but all the scenery was added later . Dream home: The palatial mansion home of Gatsby's lover Daisy was conjured up by computer magic . The wheel deal: Jay Gatsby's flamboyant 1929 yellow Duesenberg actually roared around a car park - not the streets of Manhattan .","Dazzling scenery in Luhrmann film was actually created with the help of green and blue screens and CGI .

"A 21-year-old student not only survived a potentially life-threatening injury after snapping her ankle and becoming stranded while hiking on a mountain, but she also produced a hilarious video of her ordeal while waiting to be rescued. Alexandra 'Lexi' De Forest, of Fort Collins, Colorado, forced herself to stay calm and incredibly focused on comedy while coping with the excruciating pain after falling while hiking in Wyoming last Saturday. Attempting to jump over a large trench the brunette slipped, shattered her ankle and was left stranded on the mountainside unable to move. As her companion rushed to find help, the Colorado State University senior made the video diary on her phone to distract herself from the horrifying prospect of dying alone in the wilderness. Scroll down for video . Staying positive: Lexi De Forest snapped her ankle while hiking in Wyoming last Saturday. Rather than panicking, the pretty brunette made a hilarious video diary until her rescuers arrived . ‘Speaking out loud and my . stream-of-consciousness settled me,’ she told FoxNews. 'I was talking . about my loved ones and my dog. Anything to keep me from staring at my . ankle. It was pretty gross.' De Forest had earlier set off on a camping trip to Vedauwoo mountain with her friend Erik . Henry and they had managed to watch the sun go down from the top of a nearby rock . formation. After the sun had set, the pair were marching on to a nearby campsite when they . came across a trench eight-feet-deep and six-feet-across. 'So, this is me. I just broke my ankle. Eww. For the second time now come on, Lexi, you’d think you’d be better at this by now…this walking thing.' 'This is me moving my foot, and it's . really gross. I'd show you more but if I looked at it, I might vomit on . myself. And no one wants to see that.' 'I am really scared. But in, like, the calmest, coolest sense.' 'I’m not going to tell you how scared I am of bears right now.' 'Big shout out to my fam.' 'I have made a lot of good decisions…was one them probably . wasn’t jumping over that trench.' 'Optimism is key' After Henry successfully leaped across the trench, it was De Forest’s turn. But as she prepared to jump she slipped and fell in. The student admitted . to a brief moment of panic when she first saw her detached ankle. ‘I felt blood all over me, my knees and elbows were cut, and my plan . immediately was to crawl down the mountain,’ she told FoxNews. But that plan came unstuck when crawling proved too painful. Henry then tried . to carry his injured companion down the mountainside but became too . exhausted to carry on. At 8pm, with night quickly setting in, Henry rushed off to find help. Now left alone De Forest refused to panic and instead began documenting her terrifying ordeal on her phone. The footage starts with a shot of De Forest’s foot completely twisted round with blood running down her trainers. ‘So, this is me. I just broke my ankle. Eww. For the second time now’, she begins the film, ‘like, come on, Lexi, you’d think you’d be better at this by now… this walking thing.’ Trying to forget the excruciating pain and frightening situation, De Forest talks to the camera nonstop for almost seven minutes as she waits to be rescued. Ouch! Lexi showed the backwards angle her foot was in after she fell while trying to jump over a trench . Inspirational: Aron Ralston, left, became trapped under a boulder while hiking in a remote Utah canyon, he freed himself by sawing off his right arm below the elbow with a small utility knife. James Frano, right, played Ralston in Danny Boyle's film of the incredible feat, 127 Hours . ‘This is me moving my foot, and it's really gross. I'd show you more but if I looked at it, I might vomit on myself. And no one wants to see that. 'I don’t know first aid for a foot that is not attached to your ankle so I’m doing the best I can,’ she jokes. But at one point the student admits to just how petrified she is: ‘I am ******* scared. I am really scared. But in, like, the calmest, coolest sense. ‘I’m not going to tell you how scared I am of bears right now,’ she continues, flashing her pearly whites with a laugh. Referencing her agony only a few times, De Forest desperately focuses on other things, giving shout outs to her friends and family, as well as describing her surroundings. When she spots the lights of her rescuers in the distance she whoops and cheers before reminding herself that ‘optimism is key.’ At one point she even breaks into song – recounting how she can still feel her toes. Admirers: Lexi has become an internet sensation and won a legion of admirers after posting a YouTube video of her terrifying ordeal . Stranded: Lexi spent an hour alone unable to move on the Vedauwoo mountainside while her friend rushed to get help . Continuing to joke and stay positive, . she says: ‘I have made a lot of good decisions…was one them probably . wasn’t jumping over that trench.’ De Forest was stuck on the mountainside alone for an hour and, as the video ends at 9pm, her rescuers arrive. She was airlifted to the Medical Center of the Rockies in Loveland, Colorado and was released on Wednesday night. Her ordeal echoes the incredible story . of ‘127 hours’ hiker Aron Ralston, who was forced to saw off his own . arm after it was trapped under a bolder for five days. And, as she recovers from the fall, De Forest can take solace that the inspirational video has won her a legion of online admirers. While many praise her positive attitude, others compliment her beauty – focusing in on her perfect teeth. ‘I think this lady should be endorsing some sort of dentistry product. What perfect teeth!’ one user comments on Gawker. One . commentator posted on the Reddit website, ‘Wow, not only a bad ass but . super gorgeous’ while another simply writes: ‘10/10. Would marry.’ However, the hiker is currently off the market as she has started dating Henry, her heroic rescuer. Since she posted the video onto YouTube on Wednesday, it has been seen more than 21,000 times. Beneath the video De Forest writes: 'Just hanging out on top of a mountain. At night. Alone. With a broken ankle. No biggie.' MailOnline has reached out to De Forest for comment. Distraction: De Forest says that she made the video to desperately try and distract herself from the terrifying prospect of dying in the Wyoming wilderness .

"A Seattle woman was attacked and dragged 20 feet by a grizzly bear while working for a Canadian mining company in Alaska - but survived with minor only injuries. Julia Stafford, 20, a University of British Columbia student, smartly played dead after the bear knocked her - and a male colleague - over and on to the ground. Attacked: Julia Stafford was working for a Canadian mining company in Alaska when she - and a male colleague - were attacked by a grizzly bear . 'It bit my hand and kind of dragged me 20 feet over the rocks and just left me,' Stafford told The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner from her hospital bed while ironically holding - you guessed it - a teddy bear. 'I was worried I was going to die briefly, but it was fine once she let me go and ran away...It happened really quick.' The hair-raising encounter reportedly occurred about 1:30 p.m. Sunday afternoon - just two days after another grizzly bear ate a hiker in Denali National Park and Preserve. Dangerous Encounter: Stafford was reportedly dragged some 20 feet by the beast after it knocked her over - and then just as suddenly meandered away . It happened when Stafford and Kerry - his last name was not available - were collecting rock samples in the rain near a foggy ravine for Pure Nickel Inc., a Canadian company. 'The bear sort of walked out of the fog and it had two cubs with it,' Stafford told the News-Miner. 'We started walking uphill to get away from it and it started walking toward us. 'We stopped once we saw it was following us and tried to get the bear spray out but by then it was already running toward us. Striking Twice: The attack on Stafford and her colleague came only two days after hiker Richard White of San Diego was eaten by a bear in Denali National Park and Preserve . 'I was wearing gloves and they were wet and it was confusing,' she reportedly added. 'There was just not enough time to get the bear spray out.' Stafford, a geological engineering student, suffered cuts to her right hand and scratch marks on her back that required stitches. She told the News-Miner she will need surgery for a broken bone in her hand, as well. The attack happened two days after a lone backpacker in Denali  was killed by another grizzly bear that has since been fatally shot by an Alaskan state trooper. It was the first fatal bear mauling in the park's 95-year history, officials have said. Richard White, 49, of San Diego was killed after he brazenly violated the quarter-mile berth that hikers at the park are required to give bears. During that incident, officials said, White spent eight minutes taking photos  of his killer from a range of about 50 yards before the bear turned and attacked.","Julia Stafford survived the attack with only minor injuries, but will need surgery to repair a broken hand .

"Shaun Bailey has been moved to a position in the Cabinet Office after losing his job as a special adviser before a number of former public school pupils were appointed at Downing Street . The only black working class adviser to David Cameron has alleged he has been pushed out of Downing Street by an Old Etonian 'clique'. Shaun Bailey has been moved to a 'non-position' in the Cabinet Office after losing his job as the Prime Minister's special adviser for youth and crime before a number of former public school pupils were appointed, it has been reported. Mr Bailey last night insisted on Twitter that he was 'very happy' with his move to the Cabinet Office. But according to a report in the The Telegraph, he has told friends he was not allowed into Downing Street's inner circle because he was 'different'. According to the report, Mr Bailey, who ran to be an MP in the London constituency of Hammersmith in the 2010 election, had privately told of his frustration that his concerns about the party's lack of appeal in black, working class communities had not been listened to. A friend of Mr Bailey told the paper: 'They just didn't get what Shaun was saying.' The source said he warned the party needed to show it was diverse, if it wanted to be able to say it was. The friend said: 'Shaun always says that you can see from space that the place is dominated by those from Eton.' The father-of-two, who is in his early 40s, is understood to still hope to become a Conservative MP. He was seen as a rising star when he was picked by the Tories to run against Labour MP Andy Slaughter in Hammersmith in 2007, and only narrowly lost out. Despite the defeat, Mr Bailey, who grew up in north Kensington, west London, was later appointed Mr Cameron's 'Big Society Ambassador' before moving onto his role as special adviser for youth and crime, an area in which he has great experience. Mr Bailey, who narrowly lost out in his bid to become Conservative MP for Hammersmith in 2010, was once thought of as one of David Cameron's favourite young politicians . A youth worker for more than 20 years, Mr Bailey first worked as a drugs councillor before co-founding his own charity, My Generation, which focuses on social problems among the young. Shaun . Bailey has long been spoken of in the higher echelons of Downing Street . as a future political star, and has even been mooted as a future Home . Secretary or Mayor of London. He grew up in west London, becoming . a security guard at Wembley and the Trocadero centre in order . to fund his degree in computer aided technology at South Bank . University. But Mr Bailey, a former army cadet and . keen gymnast, made his mark as a youth worker, helping drug addicts before setting up his own charity, My Generation, . which helps young people with social problems. In 2007 he was selected as the . Conservative party candidate to fight for a seat at the 2010 elections . in the constituency of Hammersmith, but he narrowly lost out to Labour MP Andy Slaughter. Despite the defeat, he had made his mark with Number 10, pioneering ideas on youth crime and breaking Britain's dependency culture. He was selected as Mr Cameron's Big . Society Ambassador in 2011 and later as the Prime Minister's special . adviser on youth and crime. His removal from the role puts question marks over his ambition to again stand as an MP for the 2015 elections. Mr Bailey was paid £60,000 to advise Mr Cameron but he was moved to the Cabinet Office in January. He is believed to now be earning £36,000 a year and is on a one year contract. Mr Bailey last night wrote on Twitter: 'Very happy with my move to the Cabinet Office. The PM's office have treated me well.' A Cabinet Office spokesman said: . 'Shaun Bailey is undertaking a part-time role with the Office for Civil . Society as the Government's Communities and Youth Engagement Champion. 'His . experience and background, which include working as the PM's adviser on . Youth and Crime mean he is well placed to advise on the Government's . initiatives for young people in their communities.' A .

Tory MP Therese Coffey revealed . she was encouraging the Prime Minister to undergo so-called . ‘unconscious bias’ training in a bid to help make both the Government . and the Conservative Party more diverse. Mr . Cameron has been accused of displaying schoolboy sexism towards female . MPs in the Commons – once telling shadow Treasury chief secretary Angela .

"Maybe it’s his enormous, bulging brown eyes. Or the permanently wrinkled up-turned nose. Or it could be his pointy, over-sized ears. There’s little doubt that Alan, a diminutive five-month-old French bulldog, has a certain je ne sais quoi. ‘Most people associate bulldogs exclusively with England, but this one’s different and definitely full of character,’ says Alan’s besotted owner, Lisa Bristow, a 31-year-old marketing director from London. ‘I can’t walk him down the street without people stopping and admiring him.’ All ears: French bulldogs are loved for their comical looks . They aren’t the only ones. The French bulldog — a kind of ‘bulldog-lite’ which emerged in the 19th century when traditional bulldogs were mated with pugs and terriers to create a miniature version — is one of the fastest growing breeds in Britain, with owners willing to pay £1,000 for one. Last year, the Kennel Club received 6,990 new French bulldog registrations — an increase of 49 per cent on the previous year and of more than 1,000 per cent compared to ten years ago. Enthusiasm for ‘Frenchies’ as fans call them, far exceeds enthusiasm for traditional British bulldogs — the Kennel Club had a thousand fewer registrations for the British breed. Celebrity owners include the Beckhams, whose Frenchie Scarlet is a regular fixture on Victoria’s Twitter page — as well as fashion designer Henry Holland, former Made In Chelsea star Millie Mackintosh and the Oscar-winning actress Reese Witherspoon. X-Men star Hugh Jackman is rarely seen without his cream-coloured French bulldog Dali, while Girls Aloud singer Sarah Harding is devoted to her French bulldog Yogi. So what is it about the Frenchie that has turned it into the dog du jour? X-Men star Hugh Jackman is rarely seen without his cream-coloured French bulldog Dali . Certainly not their looks. With their squashed snouts, bulging eyes, stocky bodies and squat spindly legs, they’re unlikely to win any beauty prizes. But for owners, their comical appearance is part of the charm. ‘They are known as the clowns of the canines, and it’s so true,’ says Daisy Dickinson, a 27-year-old beauty writer from Cambridge, whose dog is five-year-old Roxy. Fans often post photos online of their Frenchies dressed up to look as ridiculous as possible. Some dogs have become celebrities in their own right. Sir Charles Barkley, a 21-month-old cream Frenchie, appeared on a range of canine ‘hoodies’ after his owners set up an Instagram photo account that  attracted 200,000 followers on the picture-sharing site. Another, Trotter, has nearly 190,000. He is beloved for his exhaustive collection of hats. French Bulldogs are particularly well-suited to owners who live in cities and work long hours. They rarely grow taller than 12 inches or weigh much more than 2st, and dislike extreme temperatures, so are suited to indoor-living. They enjoy human company, are affectionate with owners, and good with children. It’s not the first time Frenchies have experienced a moment in the spotlight. They were all the rage in mid-19th century France. Despite their name, the dogs partly originated in Britain. They were introduced to the Continent by Nottingham’s lace workers who, displaced by machinery after the Industrial Revolution, moved to Normandy in search of work. In Britain, breeders had seen their size as a defect, but by the 1850s in France, they had become a Parisian must-have, known as ‘bouledogues francais’ and popular among artists, writers and high-society ladies. Their return to favour now fits with a longer-term trend for diminutive breeds, or ‘handbag dogs’, which has already seen chihuahuas, pugs and miniature poodles enjoy a place in the spotlight. Kennel Club secretary Caroline Kisko says: ‘People see a picture of a celebrity out carrying a small dog and want one, too.’ But although responsibly-bred Frenchies can enjoy long and healthy lives, living for more than a decade, the breed is prone to health problems. Their short snouts and compact heads, the result of centuries of selective breeding, mean their airways are compacted. They struggle to regulate their temperature, and find breathing in warm weather difficult. Exposure to extreme heat can be lethal. A French bulldog has his teeth cleaned at the Harrods pet parlour . They also have notoriously delicate digestive systems, a reputation for flatulence and a tendency to allergies. French bulldogs can suffer spine and knee pain, and tend to suffer eye problems, such as glaucoma, corneal ulcers and cataracts. The Kennel Club has a register of ‘assured’ breeders on its website, who have been checked over and will only register certain colours of the breed — ‘brindle’, a mix of coloured and black hairs, such as Alan and Roxy; ‘pied’, predominantly white; and ‘fawn’, similar to brindle but with black eyelashes and rims. Other colours, such as the grey-black . ‘blue’ bulldog beloved of celebrities are not approved because they . often suffer from a condition which can result in hair loss and chronic . skin inflammation. Frenchie fans insist that - when properly looked after, this is a breed which can rival any other . And breeders with no Kennel Club affiliation advertise French bulldog puppies online — including Blues — for anything from £500 to £1,600. Frequently, they are based abroad. Some unscrupulous Eastern Europeans breed them in pitiful conditions, and because pets from the EU no longer need to be quarantined, smuggling puppies has never been easier. Last year, the number of dogs coming from Romania increased by more than 1,000 per cent. Another unexpected side-effect of the craze has been the recent wave in bulldog thefts. In February, a seven-month-old French bulldog puppy was stolen from a garden in Aberdare, but was recovered two weeks later. A month earlier, a five-month-old French bulldog was stolen from a home in Stratford-upon-Avon. And a man wielding a knife seized a two-year-old French bulldog from a home in Huddersfield in December. Frenchie fans insist that — when properly looked after, this is a breed which can rival any other. ‘With careful, knowledgeable breeding and care, they can be healthy, lovable, funny little dogs with huge personalities and with no more or less problems than your average Labrador,’ adds Daisy Dickinson. As for Roxy’s status as a fashion icon — it’s just an added bonus. ‘I can see why they’ve stolen the hearts of so many . . . Roxy’s my best friend and I adore her.’","Breed emerged in the 19th century when traditional bulldogs were mated with pugs and terriers .

"A headteacher who introduced a policy of handing out razor blades to a pupil so they could self harm 'safely' at school has been cleared of misconduct. Laura Blair, the former head of Unsted Park School - a specialist school in Surrey for children with Asperger’s syndrome and ‘higher functioning autism’ - was investigated after whistleblowers at the school alerted the authorities. However a disciplinary panel of the National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL) has now cleared Miss Blair of unacceptable professional conduct. Laura Blair introduced a policy of handing out razor blades to a pupil at Unsted Park School, pictured, in Godalming, Surrey, so they could self harm. She has been cleared of of unacceptable professional conduct . The panel heard how the headteacher allowed a ‘controlled self-harm’ policy at the school in Godalming, in a bid to control the behaviour of a single pupil, referred to as Pupil A, who had a history of self harming. Just six days after the policy was launched a number of whistleblowers at the school raised concerns - saying they were worried the pupil could accidentally kill themselves - and the policy was scrapped by the headteacher. The panel heard how the pupil was given a ‘sterile disposable razor blade’ and was allowed in a room by themselves so they could ‘self harm’ - with a teacher checking in on them every five-10 minutes. When the pupil had finished, teachers would dress and clean the wounds. Just six days after the 'controlled self harm' policy was launched at Unsted Park School, pictured, a number of whistleblowers at the school raised concerns - saying they were worried the pupil could kill themselves . A spokeswoman for the Priory Group, which is responsible for running the school, said last year that it was a ‘short term procedure’ in the ‘best interests of the pupil’ after it was introduced in January 2012. George Brown, a former child support worker at the school, told the panel this week that he had raised concerns that the pupil ‘could bleed to death in as little as two minutes if an artery was cut’. But the NCTL panel this week found that the former head - who left the school after her botched policy came to light in March last year - was not guilty of unacceptable professional conduct. The panel ruled that the ‘controlled self harm policy’ was ill-advised and ‘badly thought out’, but that it came about because of ‘failings in communication’ between school chiefs and a ‘lack of experience’ of Miss Blair’s part. When the pupil had finished using the razor, teachers would dress and clean the wounds, a disciplinary panel of the National College for Teaching and Leadership heard (file picture) John Pemberton, the chair of the panel, said that Miss Blair was responsible for the policy, saying that she had told them ‘Pupil A’s behaviour was becoming an increasing cause for concern’. He said that Miss Blair ‘failed to follow best practices’ due to her lack of experience and her keenness to help Pupil A. He told the panel: 'She said that she won’t make the same mistake again and the panel accepts this.' The school principal Steve Dempsey and general manager Phil Jonas were both cleared of any involvement in the policy. A spokesman for the Priory Group, which runs the school, said: 'The company notes the decision of the NCTL.' Siobhan Freegard, founder of parenting website Netmums said: 'Children who self harm need intense help and support - but this sends out the wrong signals. 'Having an adult in a position of authority not only condone your actions but assist you in them could make children think the behaviour is normal and not a danger to them. 'While the clearly teacher felt she was acting in the child's best interests, it may show that specialists in this area need more training and guidance. 'Self harm is a cry for help and shows kids are not coping. 'They need love and care to get to the root of their issues, not a razor blade to slash open their skin.' A spokesperson from charity Selfharm.co.uk said when the policy was revealed last year: 'The issue of controlled self-harm has proven to be effective in some areas, but only under the correct supervision. 'Self-harm is sometimes the safest option for a young person - if they’re using self-harm to make life a bit easier to manage, then taking it away from them without replacing it with something else can actually bring on a desperate kind of depression that could make them slide from self-harm to having suicidal ideation. 'I’d rather someone be self-harming in a way they can manage as safely as possible than be left stranded with no way to cope and be thinking about more desperate measures. 'In essence, it’s not possible to say that it’s a right or wrong approach to dealing with self-harm in young people - that judgment comes down to how it’s being supported, the policies in place and the point at which someone is deemed appropriate to engage in such a programme. 'I’d be horrified if a school was trying to manage such a scheme, but open-minded to an appropriate residential facility implementing it as one of many care pathways.'","Laura Blair allowed 'controlled self harm' at Unsted Park School, Surrey .

"A woman has claimed that she was told to stop dancing at an African arts festival in Missouri because she is white. Susan Stone, who performs at St Louis arts festivals dressed in brightly-colored tutus, said she was dancing at the African Arts Festival in Forest Park when a member of staff approached her. In an interaction that she caught on camera, the man repeatedly told her to sit down before making remarks that were racist, she said. Scroll down for videos . Upset: Susan Stone complains about her treatment by a festival staffer in a YouTube video. Stone, who was wearing this tutu at the time of the incident, says he asked her to stop dancing because she was white . 'This is not the ballerina arts festival, this is not the European arts festival,' he said, according to a video of their conversation. 'It is not the Caucasian arts festival.' In another video describing the altercation, she said the man threatened her with jail before a guard put one handcuff around her wrist, dragged her away from the dance area and put her on a bus. 'I have been discriminated against because of gender and lots of things but never because I'm white,' she told KMOV. 'They're supposed to be sharing the African culture with everybody. How can you do that if you want someone out? I feel angry because they're missing out . on the beauty of everything.' Altercation: She captured the altercation in a blurry video. The man can be heard saying 'it is not the Caucasian Arts Festival' and he also can be heard threatening her with jail . Caught on camera: She was upset by the remarks made by this man pictured on her video . The co-chairman of the event told the news channel that Stone was being disruptive between performances and did not stop when she was asked to. But he admitted that the employee did not act appropriately. 'That's something that's unacceptable and that's an apology from me because we want everyone to showcase their talents and their abilities,' Jason McNairy told KMOV. On her YouTube channel, danceoflifedancer, Stone says she has been a dancer for 13 years and has never been treated like she was at the festival. Performance: Stone has been dancing for the public for 13 years, calling it the Dance of Life . Proud: She said she has never been so poorly treated, and the event organizer has now apologized .

"In tests, it took just minutes to home in on bowel tumours before dramatically shrinking them . A two-in-one drug that seeks out and destroys tumours while being kind to the rest of the body has been developed by researchers. In tests, it took just minutes to home in on bowel tumours before dramatically shrinking them. In some cases, mice whose cancer was thought to be terminal were cured. The drugs also act by ‘stealth’, sneaking into cancerous areas without causing damage to the surrounding healthy cells. In standard cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy, drugs attack anywhere in the body, meaning healthy cells as well as cancerous ones are damaged. This indiscriminate attack on the body’s cells leads to side effects including hair loss and nausea. But using the new technique, normal cells should not be affected, meaning that patients are spared the usual side effects. Excitingly, the U.S. researchers believe the same technique could be used to combat other cancers, such as those of the breast, prostate, lung and skin. Bowel cancer is Britain’s second biggest cancer killer, after lung cancer, and claims more than 16,000 lives a year. The Californian researchers began by searching for a compound that targets tumours rather than healthy tissue. They settled on one called IF7,  a small protein that seeks out  the blood vessels that tumours need to grow and spread around the body. They attached IF7 to a fluorescent probe and injected it into mice with bowel tumours. Within minutes, the tumours lit up. Bowel cancer is Britain's second biggest cancer killer, after lung cancer. It claims more than 16,000 lives a year . They then linked IF7 to a powerful cancer drug, gave the two-in-one compound to diseased mice, and watched the tumours shrink. The results were dramatic, with many treated tumours disappearing completely within a fortnight, even at low doses. Writing in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers said that IF7 targets tumours with ‘unprecedented’ speed.","Disease is Britain’s second biggest cancer killer, after lung cancer, and claims more than 16,000 lives a year .

"Show of force: A police officer armed with an assault rifle and a baton gun on the estate in Luton . With a heavily-armed policeman guarding the playground, assault rifle at the ready, it could be the scene of a terror alert. In fact, this is a routine patrol just yards from a suburban primary school. The show of force is designed to calm residents of an estate plagued by gang shootings. In the past four months there have been nine gun-related incidents in Luton linked to the Marsh Farm and Lewsey Farm estates. In the latest, a 16-year-old boy was shot in the back early on Saturday morning. He may never walk again. The violence has left law- abiding families so terrified they welcome the patrols, even if they risk scaring children. Faye Bell, 37, a mother of two, said: . ‘The armed police might seem heavy-handed to some people but to us they . are hugely reassuring. ‘It’s very sad that it has come to this but we need the police to be armed so they can protect our kids.’ The officers, with a dog unit, have . been patrolling the estate near the rundown Purley shopping centre all . week. Marsh Farm residents told the Daily Mail yesterday that the armed . patrols had given them the confidence to go outside. Shannon Read, 17, said: ‘I don’t really come out of my house at all so it’s reassuring to know these patrols are here. ‘I knew the lad who got shot on Saturday so it has been even more terrifying recently.’ Darren Putney, 46, added: ‘Some of . the children on the way to school or in the play area look frightened. ‘But the police need to make their presence known.’ The officers carry Heckler and Koch G36C assault rifles with 5.56mm calibre ammunition that can pierce body armour. A boy walks past an armed officer as police patrol the Marsh Farm Estate after a spate of shootings . They were introduced in response to . the threat of a ‘marauding’ terror attack, like the one in Mumbai . involving a gang of men with semi- automatic rifles.

Parents in Luton appear resigned to . the patrols. Lisa Conway, 25, a mother of three, said: ‘A Taser gun is . not going to be enough when you are dealing with armed gangs.’ Bedfordshire Police have also invoked .

Richer said: ‘Obviously we are concerned that there could be further . incidents and we are doing everything we can do to prevent it.’ A judge at Luton Crown Court yesterday condemned the gang violence. Kyle Beckford, 22, was sentenced to 24 years for killing Delaney Brown, 19, by driving a stolen BMW at him last year. Judge Richard Foster said: ‘Gang . culture gives its members a sense of belonging, of self importance ... There can be no excuse for the men of this town to live in this gang . culture.’","Bedfordshire town suffers nine shootings in four month crime wave .

"The crisp white powder crunches under foot, stacks of crystalline rock sparkle and ‘icicles’ glitter from above. No, it’s not a secluded Alpine cave but a clinic in West London. The white powder isn’t snow, it’s salt. So are the icicles and the rocks piled in the corner. I am standing in the Adalex Clinic’s recently-opened ‘salt grotto’. The grotto (actually, it’s less of a ‘grotto’ than just a plain old room with assorted sun loungers) is the brainchild of Grace Hart, a psychologist. Magic grotto? A sceptical Alice-Azania Jarvis chills out in the salt cave in West London . She says that such grottos are commonplace in her native Poland, and claims that a spell in its salty confines — a typical session lasts an hour and costs £25 — offers all manner of health benefits, from relieving asthma to improving blood circulation and lowering blood pressure. Above all, after an hour in the grotto I should experience, she says, a sense of ‘psycho physical comfort’. Which definitely sounds like a good thing — even if I’m not entirely sure what she means by it. Actually, quite a lot of what clinic manager Grace says about the health benefits of the salt grotto doesn’t bear close scrutiny. ‘It’s about feeling good, mentally and physically,’ she tells me. ‘You will feel calm and refreshed, and you won’t have any anxiety.’ Benefits: Salt is rich in minerals such as iodine, potassium and bromide . The apparently miraculous power of salt is all, she says, down to its ‘micro-elements’. Salt is rich in minerals such as iodine, potassium and bromide. Usually, we get these by eating it — but Grace believes we can absorb them by sitting in a room full of the stuff. ‘We are depleted of micro-elements because our water is polluted, our diet is bad. But micro-elements like bromide have a calming effect on the brain. If you are stressed out, you can become calm in a natural way.’ As well as a new-found sense of calm, after an hour in the grotto, she promises, I should feel reinvigorated and healthy. ‘The air is very clean inside the grotto — ten times cleaner than normal air,’ she continues. ‘Salt is anti-fungal and anti-bacterial. You start breathing slower and deeper as the salt opens up your bronchial airways. You breathe better and you feel better.’ While it may sound like bunkum (OK, it definitely does sound like bunkum), in Central and Eastern Europe they have been using salt grottos — both natural and artificial — for donkey’s years. The first was set up 150 years ago after Dr Feliks Boczkowski, a Polish physician from Wieliczka, near Krakow, noted that local salt miners didn’t suffer from lung diseases. A natural grotto was carved out within the Wieliczka mines themselves, 400 feet underground. It became popular with those suffering respiratory disease, and is still in use today. Before I’m allowed into Grace’s grotto, she hands me a pair of blue plastic shoe covers to protect both the salt and my shoes. To keep the salt fresh, it is regularly topped up from the stash of enormous 25kg sacks kept in a storage room at the back. And it definitely is salt. After Grace closes the grotto’s outer door and leaves me alone, I taste a pinch just to be sure. The PA system in the corner plays a pan-pipes version of Just The Way You Are, while angled lamps make the salt look rosy pink, with blotches of blue on the ceiling and orange stripes along the walls. Believer: Former psychologist Grace Holt says an hour in the salt cave offers all manner of health benefits . It’s a little like being in a Seventies nightclub. Nevertheless, after 20 minutes in the cave, the promised sense of calm is indeed descending. In fact, I’m starting to nod off. I’m seated on a squishy sun lounger and wrapped up in a snuggly blanket which Grace has provided. Though there are magazines in the waiting room, in the grotto there’s nothing to do but drift in and out of sleep. Clients are asked to leave their mobile phones behind. There is a soporific sound of gently trickling water coming from what looks like an enormous garden water feature. This, explains Grace, is the grotto’s ‘evaporation tower’. A good six feet high, it features an artfully-arranged fan of salt-encrusted twigs inside a giant wooden display case. Water flowing from a tank concealed within the tower’s wardrobe-like structure is trickling over them. It’s brine, brought over from Poland, Grace tells me. ‘It is one of the most healthy, healing waters,’ she says. It is a very special mineral water. Sitting near it as it flows, many of your positive ions will change to negative ions, which always make you feel better. ‘In the city, there are a lot of positive ions — which make you feel anxious, angry and agitated. Tranquil: Though there are magazines in the waiting room, in the grotto there¿s nothing to do but drift in and out of sleep . Negative ions make you feel refreshed and fantastic.’ From what I can remember of GCSE physics, ions are simply atoms or molecules with positive or negative electrical charges. Why they should leave you anxious or refreshed eludes me. The twigs, meanwhile, are birch — a ‘healing wood’ according to Grace. But of course! The salt itself is equally exotic. The three tons which cover the floor have been brought from Poland, while the rocks lining the walls and piled at the corners are Himalayan salt imported from Pakistan. According to Grace: ‘Not every salt has all the special properties. Himalayan salt has 84 different micro-elements.’ In total, the room contains more than 10 tons of salt. Building it took a month and cost £35,000. There’s no doubt that lolling around in my sun lounger is a rather pleasant way to while away an hour — but how does the scientific evidence stack up? Unfortunately, there isn’t a huge amount. ‘I know of no good scientific evidence about this approach and see no reason why this should be any better than relaxing in any other quiet environment,’ says Professor Edzard Ernst, a physician and former Professor of Complementary Medicine at Exeter University. Wendy Sadler, of Science Made Simple, an independent organisation aimed at explaining scientific research to the public, agrees — and questions the idea that exposure to ‘micro-particles’ and ‘negative ions’ can make you feel calmer and more energised. She says: ‘There’s no reason at all you should feel calm because of exposure to negative ions. And there have been no studies that have shown mineral water will convert positive ions to negative ones.’ Neither is there much to support the myriad other health benefits salt grottos purport to offer. Malayka Rahman, research officer at Asthma UK, says that while some sufferers have noticed short-term benefits, it is not clear whether that’s down to salt or simply the effect of an hour’s relaxation. A couple of months ago a similar business, the Salt Cave — a company which operates a chain of grottos across the UK — was forced to remove a section of its website which claimed salt therapy could treat various ailments, including cystic fibrosis and psoriasis. The Advertising Standards Authority concluded that there was insufficient evidence. Inconclusive: Unfortunately there isn't much scientific evidence to support the supposed health benefits of using a salt cave . Grace is unperturbed by such naysayers. ‘There’s always a war between traditional doctors and alternative therapies,’ she says. ‘The medical world is like a Mafia. You can’t patent a natural thing like this, so there’s no money in it for them.’ And anyway, she says, business is booming. Though the clinic is ghostly quiet during my time there, Grace claims her grotto often has 30 customers a day. Clients hoping to treat their asthma are recommended to make two or three visits a week for seven or eight weeks — at a cost of more than £400. It sounds an awful lot to realign your ions, if you ask me. You can even hire the grotto for private parties — complete with champagne and canapés in the clinic’s sleek white reception area. The next marketing opportunity is a new wrinkle cream made with hemp oil and (yes, you guessed it) Himalayan salt. Grace says: ‘Salt keeps moisture in the skin and smooths it out. Look, I’m 62, but I don’t have many wrinkles.’ (It is true that she does look some ten years younger than her age.) As for me? Well, I can’t say I experience any great transformation. Grace tells me I should sleep deeply that night, and certainly I leave the clinic feeling relaxed. But whether that’s the salt at work or has more to do with the fact that I’ve spent an hour snoozing on a sun lounger, I don’t know. At any rate, it was a perfectly pleasant — if expensive — way to spend a morning. As for any supposed health benefits . . . well, I’d take those with a pinch of salt.","Adalex Clinic is a recently-opened  'salt grotto' in West London .
