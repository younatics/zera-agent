"A man accused of luring a 15-year-old girl to her death over Facebook was intending to abduct her then stage a fake rescue so he could be hailed as a hero, a court has heard. Kyle Dube, 21, is charged with the 2013 murder of Nichole Cable, who was found in woodland in Bangor, Maine, after an eight-day search. Police have said Dube told others that he'd intended to abduct Nichole and later come to her rescue. His plan was to kidnap her while wearing a ski mask, return later without the disguise, find her and be hailed as a hero, authorities have said. The news came as Dube's trial got underway in Bangor with opening statements and tearful testimony from the mother of Nichole, a high school sophomore from Glenburn . Elaborate plot? Kyle Dube, 21, (left) allegedly abducted Nichole Cable, 15, (right) in 2013 so that he could stage a rescue and be hailed as a hero. She was found dead in woodland in Bangor, Maine . Dube is pleading not guilty to abduction and murder, arguing that somebody else committed the crimes. According to prosecution, phony Facebook account was traced to his home, his DNA was found on a hat at the end of Nichole's driveway and cell tower records show that he was in the area of Nichole's home. Defense attorney Wendy Hatch said Monday that the state rushed to judge Dube, and she argued that someone else had committed the crimes. 'We are here to show you the state has holes in their case. They have mistakes, big mistakes,' Hatch told the jury, adding that Dube 'got up the next morning, got dressed, kissed his daughter goodbye and went to work.' Assistant Attorney General Donald Macomber said Dube's DNA was also found on Cable's fingernails, and he had scratches on his face after she disappeared. He also said Dube alluded to the crime while having an emotional outburst as officers tried to calm him down while he reported to jail for an unrelated traffic offense. Accused: Prosecutors say Dube, pictured with his attorney, left a hat with his DNA on it near Nichole's home . 'Dube responded it was what he had done, that they didn't know he had done, that he was worried about,' Macomber said. Monday's statements marked the beginning of a trial that is expected to last two weeks and includes a witness list with more than 80 names. The case prompted discussions about the appropriate use of social media at the high school she attended in Old Town. Nichole's mother, Kristine Wiley, testified that she knew Dube as a friend of her daughter's who came by their house two or three times before her disappearance. Assistant Attorney General Donald Macomber hold up a picture of Nichole Cable during opening arguments on the first day of Kyle Dube's trial at the Penobscot Judicial Center in Bangor, Maine, on Monday . Between tears, she testified that Dube reached out to her with an offer to baby-sit her other children after Nichole vanished but before her body was found. Wiley said Dube first told her he had heard Wiley said he was responsible for Nichole's disappearance. Wiley said she denied the accusation and that Dube then told her 'if I needed anything, call' and that he would watch her other children for her. She said she never took him up on the offer. Dube, of Orono, appeared in court on Monday with closely cropped hair and wearing a black suit. He showed little emotion as the trial began. Police have said the fake Facebook profile was under the name of another young man who had no involvement in the abduction. That man, Bryan Butterfield, testified on Monday that he was aware Dube didn't like him.

"A peaceful, child-free zone with the Egyptian sun beaming down by the poolside was the holiday Ray Green had hoped for at the Three Corners Ocean View at El Gouna. Instead the 52-year-old from Cramlington, Northumberland, who has a heart condition and can't walk more than 100m, found himself at the heart of a spring break-style all-night pool party. Mr Green says he was misled by the Thomas Cook brochure for the resort which offered no warning that regular parties with lasers and loud music, with revellers bused in from around the area, were held at the resort. He added that the bass in the sound system was at such a level it forced a glass to fall off the table of his room. Ray Green, 52, from Cramlington, Northumberland, received £250 compensation in vouchers from Thomas Cook after his supposed-to-be peaceful wintersun break to an El Gouna resort was ruined by a pool party . A quiet, sun-soaked pool was what Mr Green expected, but instead there was an all-night party, he said . 'The hotel was supposed to have a nice quiet pool area as advertised by Thomas Cook,' Mr Green told the Trinity Mirror. 'It was lovely, no kids, no noise, just the Egyptian sun and relaxation. However, what Thomas Cook failed to promote in the brochure is that the normally quiet pool sometimes hosts a party starting at 10pm until sun-up. 'It was complete with lasers and people being bused in from all of El Gouna, and the bass actually made my glass fall off the table. 'The next day, the pool area was littered with people trying to sleep. The queue to complain to the customer relations desk that morning was large but she apparently was not available.' Mr Green also complained to the holiday company about the room he was given because it was too far from the main area of the hotel. Mr Green also complained his Three Corners Ocean View hotel room was too far from amenities . His complaints led to Thomas Cook changing its advertising to make it clear accommodation is in two blocks . 'I was also unhappy about the room because we were put in an annex 150m (164yds) away from the main facilities, which was also not mentioned in the brochure,' he said. 'As I get out of breath after 100m it was hard for me to walk back and forth to the amenities.' Ray, who was on holiday with his partner, complained about both issues to Thomas Cook and received an offer of less than £100 in compensation, which was increased to £250 in vouchers following enquiries by the press. 'I don't feel that they are taking me seriously because they have made an offer of £82 in vouchers,' he said before the increased offer, which he accepted because he wished to travel in the future with Thomas Cook. 'I thought the days of miss-descriptions in holiday brochures were in the past.' A Thomas Cook spokesman said the company 'would like to apologise to Mr Green for any inconvenience he may have experienced while staying at the Three Corners Ocean View in Hurghada. 'It is never our intention to disappoint our customers, and we are always concerned to hear of anything that could affect their enjoyment while on holiday with us. 'Our customer services team have been in touch with Mr Green since his return to the UK to offer our apologies, and we are happy to say this matter has now been resolved to his satisfaction.' Thomas Cook apologised to Mr Green 'for any inconvenience he may have experienced' in Hurghada . Since the misunderstanding with Mr Green about his room's location, Thomas Cook has made a clarification on their website explaining that the resort's accommodation in in two separate blocks. The Thomas Cook representative said: 'We can confirm that we have reviewed all details for the Three Corners Ocean View on our website, as well as clarified the copy set to feature in future brochure editions.' However, there is still no mention of the pool parties in their literature, which is advertised within the hotel. 'The hotel has a pool party. This is not mentioned in the brochure but advertised in hotel when it is in operation. 'It is on every Thursday from 10pm to 2.30am and it normally only operates from February to November. The hotel has confirmed that the last pool party was on November 6 for 2014 and during [Mr Green's] stay there was only this one pool party.'","Ray Green, 52, said he was misled by Thomas Cook's brochure .

"The heartbroken family of slain ISIS hostage Kayla Mueller have shared her final letter to them from captivity. Carl and Marsha Mueller and their son Eric, who confirmed that Kayla had died two weeks ago, shared the last note they received from her as they appeared on the Today show on Monday. 'I am OK, healthy, remaining strong and being treated kindly. Do not worry... I love you all,' she wrote in the undated letter. 'My heart longs to be with you all as... I have never felt before, but praise be to God you are in my dreams almost every evening and for just those brief moments in my sleeping conscious that we are together I am given a warmth. Scroll down for video . Devastated: Kayla Mueller's parents Marsha and Carl, right, and her brother Eric, left, told the Today show of their exasperation that she could not be saved. They confirmed her death earlier this month . 'It's warmth enough for me to wake with a smile. Warmth enough to keep me company through the days, and warmth enough to keep my heart near to home and therefore to God.' Mueller, who grew up in Prescott, Arizona, was captured in August 2013 after leaving a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Aleppo, Syria as she visited her boyfriend, who was Syrian. On February 10, Mueller's family and U.S. officials confirmed that she had died. The Islamic State group claimed the 26-year-old international aid worker had died in a Jordanian airstrike, but that has not been confirmed. The Pentagon said it didn't know how she was killed. Her family shared the note as they spoke about their daily battle after she was captured; they worked hard to keep her name out of the press because they feared for her safety. Her brother said her situation worsened after the government traded five Taliban commanders for a captive U.S. soldier last May. The militants increased their demands after the U.S. swapped Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl. Missed: Kayla, 26, was kidnapped while in Syria in August 2013 and ISIS said she died during an airstrike in Jordan, but that has not been confirmed by U.S. officials. ISIS told the family about her death by email . Final words: Her family shared this letter - her last from captivity. She assured them she was being treated kindly but said that she missed them and often felt a 'warmth' when she thought about tem . 'That made the whole situation worse because that's when the demands got greater,' he said. 'They got larger. They realized that they had something.' His father, Carl Mueller, said that the United States' willingness to swap for Bergdahl but not pay ransom or allow ransom to be paid for his daughter 'was pretty hard to take'. 'I actually asked the president that question when we were in the White House,' Carl Mueller said without elaborating. They said they had been instructed to pay $6.2 million for Kayla's release but even if they had been able to raise the money, U.S. government policy would have prohibited them from paying the ransom. 'I really feel that we had a chance to get Kayla out,' said her father Carl, who called his daughter 'SK' - short for 'Special K'. 'We were in communications with them, unlike other families. But how do you raise $6.2 million? You know, it pretty much made it impossible.' He went on: 'We understand the policy about not paying ransom, but on the other hand, any parents out there would understand that you would want anything and everything done to bring your child home. And we tried, and we asked. But they put policy in front of American citizens' lives. And it didn't get it changed.' State Department officials have repeatedly said that the government does not pay ransoms to ISIS or exchange prisoners with the militant group. 'The United States government policy, in terms of how we operate, is we don't make concessions to terrorists. That is our policy,' spokeswoman Jen Psaki said during a news conference in January. Disappointment: Her mother said she often expected Kayla to walk through the door, as the family said they wished U.S. government policy had allowed them to do more to help their daughter . Questions: They said that when the U.S. government swapped five Taliban fighters for captive soldier Bowe Bergdahl (pictured) last May, the militants holding Kayla made greater demands . Some U.S. lawmakers were outraged by the exchange of five Taliban commanders held at the Guantanamo Bay prison for Bergdahl, an Idaho native who left his post in Afghanistan and was captured and held by the Taliban for five years. President Obama's administration has defended the swap. The Joint Chiefs of Staff unanimously supported the exchange, insisting that the United States has a sacred commitment to men and women who serve that it will never leave anyone behind on the battlefield. Meanwhile, Kayla's mother said that she was still 'in denial' about her daughter's death. 'I still expect Kayla to come through the door,' Marsha Mueller said. 'We always had that little bit of hope that we would always get her home.' The family also unveiled a new foundation set up in her memory, Kayla's Hands, devoted to the causes that she felt passionate about. 'She had to be busy with her hands doing something to help people,' her mother said. 'And as long as she was, she was just joyful. She just didn't have enough power as one little person. Maybe we can get the world behind her, or at least behind Kayla's Hands.' On the Today show on Monday, the Mueller family shared the final letter they received from Mueller while she was imprisoned. The letter does not have a date. Everyone, . Once again you are being contacted by prisoners who have been released.They will explain to you the situation. As I said in my last letter (that I pray you received from the three women). I am OK, healthy, remaining strong and being treated kindly. Do not worry... I love you all . All that I have said in the previous letter stays true. Give your suffering to the Lord, let our creator support you. Continue to pray, by God I feel your love and your prayers. As I shared with you in my last letter part of a song, I will share with you another. This one I have written for little Lex [Kayla's niece Alexis]: 'Oh my Grace. I close my eyes, you bring me home.' I look towards the day when I can sing to her the rest. I do not know what you have told her, but if it's appropriate, tell her Auntie Kayle sends her big hugs and kisses. Tell her I am very sad that I am far and that we cannot Skype like before, but when I come home we can play, make music together and have so much fun... She's my little Grace and I love her so much. My heart longs to be with you all as... I have never felt before, but praise be to God you are in my dreams almost every evening and for just those brief moments in my sleeping conscious that we are together I am given a warmth. It's warmth enough for me to wake with a smile. Warmth enough to keep me company through the days, and warmth enough to keep my heart near to home and therefore to God, Mark 12:28-30. 'The first of all the commandments is hear O'Israel, the Lord thy God is one Lord.

"Hana Khan has been found guilty of funding terrorism after sending boyfriend Jafar Turay £1,000 while he fights in Syria . The girlfriend of a jihadi fighter is facing jail after sending £1,000 to Syria to fund his terrorist activities. Hana Khan wired the money to her boyfriend Jafar Turay after he sent her 'disturbing' photographs of children posing with AK-47 rifles in the war ravaged country. The 23-year-old from Willesden, northwest London was found guilty of funding terrorism at the Old Bailey today. Turay, 28, fled the UK in 2012 after converting to Islam. He is wanted by British police on attempted murder charges said to have been committed before he travelled to Syria. During a two week trial, jurors heard how Khan, sent him £1,000 via Western Union transfer after telling him he looked 'beautiful' in a photograph taken with the Islamic State flag. She received three other photographs of children, thought to be under 10, posing with weapons in Aleppo. The 23-year-old was found guilty of two charges of funding terrorism. Anton Atkins, 31, was cleared of four charges of funding terrorism involving combat trousers and a total of £1,600. Prosecuting Chris Hehir rejected Khan's claim that she did not know Turay was fighting on behalf of Islamic State, describing the images sent to her as 'disturbing'. Referring to the co-defendants, he said: 'They knew that he had gone there to fight: in other words to use or threaten serious violence in furtherance of a cause,’ he said. ‘They knew - or at the very least should have suspected- that anything they gave him materially might be used in furtherance of fighting, by him or others. 'They are profoundly disturbing images because a deadly weapon is being put in the hands of young children who smile as if it is a good thing to hold an AK-47 or similar weapon. ‘He clearly has very little respect for the innocence of children.’ After receiving photographs of Turay posing with the ISIS flag, Khan told him he looked 'beautiful'. Anton Atkins, right, was cleared of four counts of funding terrorism after sending Turay £1,600 and a pair of trousers . The 23-year-old (left) will be sentenced next month. Atkins told the court he thought Turay was 'showing off' and that he had in fact gone to Egypt to study Arabic . The court heard how Atkins, from Woolwich, south east London, thought Turay was exaggerating in messages sent over the free service Whats App. In one, Turay, known as Joel Daley before converting to Islam, told him: 'get the loogah - as much as you can anyway - beneficial - u know this.’ But Atkins claimed he thought the jihadi was merely exaggerating and had gone to Egypt to study Arabic rather than join terrorists in Syria. He sent him £1,600 and a pair of black combat trousers. Khan however was found guilty of knowingly funding terrorist activities. She was released on conditional bail and will be sentenced on March 27. While the jury accepted she had knowledge of her boyfriend's intentions, Judge Gerald Gordon dismissed the idea Khan was an Islamic State follower or supporter. ‘Unlike some she is not, in my view prone to fundamentalist beliefs herself,' he said. ‘I think it is more the attraction of Jafar Turay.’ Khan will be sentenced for two counts of funding terrorism at the Old Bailey (above) next month .","Hana Khan was found guilty of funding terrorism at the Old Bailey .

"A couple has given up their life in California to embark on a transcontinental journey across the U.S. and Canada--all while hauling their home, a 125-square-foot house, behind them. Guillaume Dutilh and Jenna Spesard spent a year building their tiny home before leaving Los Angeles behind to start a life on the road. Now, the couple and their dog Salies are 10,000 miles and 25 states into the trek they've dubbed Tiny House Giant Journey. Scroll down for video . Tiny House Giant Journey: Guillaume Dutilh and Jenna Spesard spent a year building their tiny home before leaving Los Angeles behind to start a life on the road in a transcontinental trek they've dubbed Tiny House Giant Journey . 'We stumbled upon the tiny-house movement, and I said, ""This could be cool,""' Dutilh recalled to the Marblehead Reporter during a November stop in Massachusetts. 'We’ve never built anything or gone a journey like this, and it’s a good challenge, and we can make it our own.' The couple built the wooden dwelling on a 20 foot trailer from Tumbleweed Tiny Homes, a popular purveyor of the trendy little buildings. According to their website, the  6’8″ wide and 10’6″ high home weighs a meager '10,100lbs with all of our belongings including water and propane.' They pull the home between campgrounds, parks and event spaces with their 2006 Ford F-250. The couple met online two years ago. They both worked in behind the scenes jobs in the entertainment industry. Once they decided to build the home, it took one year to construct using reclaimed wood among other materials. 'It took a year to build it. It was suppose to be a four-month build, but it ended up being a year,' said Dutilh. Stunning: The couple met online two years ago.

"The Prime Minister's chief of staff being married to the Liberal Party director has been labelled as a conflict of the interest and the cause for in-house fighting between its members. In two explosive emails sent to the party's 27-member federal party executive and Tony Abbott on Sunday night, the party's Federal treasurer Phil Higginson expressed his outrage about Peta Credlin and her husband Brian Loughnane being placed in such influential roles describing it as the 'most serious current dilemma' within the Liberal party. In his unashamed rant, Mr Higginson said he could not understand 'how this party ever let a husband and wife team into those roles' adding that it would never be allowed in the corporate world. 'A managing director would never allow his executive assistant to be the wife of the chairman,' he wrote. Scroll down for video . The Prime Minister's chief of staff Peta Credlin (right) and her husband Liberal Party Federal Director Brian Loughnane (left) have been blamed by the party's Federal treasurer Phil Higginson for a rift in the party . Mr Higginson went on to say that the people responsible for the decision to allow Credlin and Loughnane to take on the powerful positions should 'hang their collective heads in shame'. The honourary treasurer said he found it a 'complete mystery' as to how the husband and wife duo were selected for the influential jobs which required 'competitive tension' and confidential discussions with both sides of the Liberal party . 'I am overwhelmed daily by the sheer vitriol and pent-up animosities and enmities that exist. 'I haven't worked pro bono for over four years in this role and over 10 years for my good friend (Mr Abbott) to see him brought down this way,' the email was reported as saying in The Herald Sun. Mr Higginson went on to say that if the situation wasn't so serious that he would find it 'almost amusing' while calling on the party to take immediate action. 'It immediately brings about the cessation of open communications to the federal director, contributes to wooden and unreliable communication and a reluctance towards open and trusting lines of communication, and, dare I say it, retribution,' the leaked email said. Mr Higginson also claimed that he had only signed off on the party's 2013/14 accounts in the past week due to a 'significant delay' in the information about expenses that he requested from Mr Loughnane and the party's secretariat, Fairfax media reported. He also highlighted concerns over financial reporting standards within the party, and said he would stand down from the treasurer's role before June.

"The former director of dinosaur replicas at the Natural History Museum has claimed his  wife is keeping him prisoner in a garage at their Hamptons mansion as she waits for him to die. Martin Cassidy, 84, made the claims in his pending divorce case from 62-year-old paper heiress Kate Wallach, whom he married 28 years ago, the New York Post reported. He claims she is waiting for him to die so she can avoid a divorce payout. 'I am a literal and figurative prisoner of my wife,' he said in the affidavit. Life of luxury: Martin Cassidy, 84, claims he is being kept prisoner in a garage while his wife enjoys the comforts of their $20million estate (pictured). He is trying to throw out their pre-nup and divorce her . Heiress: Kate Wallach-Cassidy, 63, is pictured Thursday in the driveway of her home in East Hampton. Her lawyer claims the paper heiress does not want to divorce her husband . Wife and mother: Mrs Wallach-Cassidy, seen last week with her son, Camaron, believes her husband of 28 years may be suffering from dementia . Cassidy claims that he only has a small bed, two flimsy folding chairs and a nail to hang his clothes on in the 30-by-40-foot room, and that maids bring him small cans of soup to eat. Meanwhile, his wife lives in luxury at their $20million estate, he claims. 'I have been relegated by the defendant to a small room on the property, in a far corner of this huge house, and to small bathroom with no bathtub or shower,' Cassidy said, the Post reported. Instead, he must rely on staff to give him the occasional sponge bath, he said. Wallach, a mother of five, owns a 20 per cent interest in her family's paper-distribution company Central National-Gottesman, and is worth more than $200million, court papers say. She inherited the share from her father, successful businessman and noted philanthropist Ira Wallach, who passed away in 2007 at age 97. Cassidy signed a pre-nuptial agreement that cut him out of her fortune ahead of their wedding nearly three decades ago. But Cassidy said he didn't realize what he was signing and only did so because Wallach said it would make her parents happier. He is now calling on the court to overturn the agreement. He also wants more than $30,000 a month from his wife, who now gives him an allowance of $2,500 a month. However, Wallach denies cutting Cassidy out of her life and believes he is developing dementia, according to her lawyer, the New York Post reported. Her lawyer Kenneth Weinstein said that she doesn't even want to divorce him, and that her husband lives in luxurious conditions. A court-appointed guardian is looking into whether Cassidy is mentally fit, and a judge will receive a finding next month. During that time, Cassidy will remain at the property. Stately home: A view of the family's home on Pondview Lane in East Hampton. Mrs Wallach-Cassidy claims her husband lives in luxurious conditions, but the 84-year-old insists his wife is just waiting for him to die . 'Imprisoned': He claims he is being held in this garage, pictured, with no kitchen or proper bathroom . But his lawyer has appealed the order and said Cassidy would prefer to stay at a rental home in Amagansett. So far, the guardian has found Cassidy's living conditions to be, 'not, by any stretch of the imagination, luxurious.'

"Up to 450,000 people may have eaten the frozen berries suspected of transmitting hepatitis A, as four more people were diagnosed with the disease on Saturday. 70,000 packets of the Chinese berries are sold each week in Australia, putting nearly half a million people at risk and sparking concerns over potential future cases. 18 people in total have been diagnosed with hepatitis A, which has an incubation period of seven weeks, leading health experts to believe that more cases will come to light. Scroll down for video . Up to 450,000 people may have eaten the frozen berries suspected of transmitting hepatitis A . Approximately two percent of the country's population may have consumed the berries, said Finn Romanes, public health physician and Victorian government medical adviser. 'We are still working on this outbreak and we think that there will be more cases come to light,' Mr Romanes told The Australian. Consumers are being urged not to buy or eat Nanna's Raspberries one kilogram packs, Nanna's Frozen Mixed Berries one kilogram packs and 300 and 500 gram packs of Creative Gourmet Mixed Berries. While only the Nanna's Mixed Berries product has been linked with the outbreak, and the other products have been recalled as a precaution, a Health Department spokesperson said that the source of the disease was still unconfirmed. 'However, the berries are the only common exposure for cases,' the Heath Department said in a statement on Saturday. Despite the Federal government refused to release statistics relating to the scare, it has been revealed that three Victorians were the first to contract Hepatitis A, between  Christmas and New Years. The Victorians were all interviewed by health authorities, and found that all three had consumed the berries, corroborating similar findings in NSW. An estimated one in 100 people who have eaten the contaminated berries will develop the disease, a figure which the Federal Health Department labelled as 'worse case scenario'. Four frozen berry products imported by Patties Foods, and sourced from China's Shandong province, were recalled this week due to fears they are linked to the viral disease Hepatitis A . The Department of Agriculture is contacting companies that have imported Chinese berries to find out about the source of the berries and supply chain food safety management systems. Early last week, the Red Cross Blood Service banned those who had eaten the berries from donating blood for two months, but lifted the ban on Saturday when they found the blood supply was not at risk. It has been revealed the frozen berries  are from the Shandong province in east China, the Daily Telegraph reports. Cities and villages in Shandong are reportedly plagued by chemical and industrial waste pollution, with farming land laying adjacent to factories and petrochemical plants. One river running through the village of Jinling is so polluted by nearby chemical factories that the water is red coloured and has a foul smell, according to local Chinese reports. The small town of Jinling in east China's Shandong province is located near the Qilu Chemical Industrial Park in Zibo City, according to the Epoch Times. A river which flows in the Chinese village Jinling in the Shandong province is one of China's most polluted areas, reportedly where frozen berries are grown and packed before they are imported and sold in Australian stores . The small town of Jinling in east China's Shandong province is located near the Qilu Chemical Industrial Park in Zibo City . In previous reports, there have been claims that the company releases chemical distribution into the river, which was once sparkly clear but has now visibly been contaminated and also emanates a stench. Residents also say there's a 'cancer virus' floating around the village as cancer is quite common in the town. This comes as reports emerged that health tests weren't conducted on any frozen berry products imported to Australia while similar goods have been tied to hepatitis breakout in North America and Europe,The Australian reports. Australia's largest juice bar chain Boost Juice has also distanced itself from a growing Hepatitis A scandal after it emerged the company sources frozen berries from China. Other major chains have taken Chinese Goji berries off the menu as a precaution amid growing customer concerns over imported fruit, after 13 cases of Hepatitis A in Australia were linked to frozen berry products imported from the country. Boost Juice general manager Adam Neill says the company imports raspberries and strawberries used in their smoothies from China. 'However, these berries are from different regions to those featured in current news reports and are not affected,' Mr Neill said. 'This fruit is Individually Quick Frozen (IQF) as it locks in all the health and nutrition benefits of fresh fruit and is packaged in Boost-dedicated facilities.' Mr Neill added that Boost Juice individually tested each batch of fruit in accordance with HACCP (Australian) and SQF (International) standards. 'One hundred per cent of our batches are also subject to microbiological and pesticide tests,' he said. 'Boost believes that any time Australian companies need to source product offshore, they should be testing every single batch.' A spokesman for Kick! Juice, which operates juice bars all over Australia, said the company sources their berries from the same Chinese supplier used by Boost. Four frozen berry products imported by Patties Foods, and sourced from China's Shandong province, were recalled this week due to fears they are linked to the viral disease Hepatitis A. A spokeswoman for juice bar chain Top Juice said the company had never sourced berries from China, but had decided to stop serving goji berries – which originate from China – as a precaution. 'For the time being we aren't supplying goji berries, the fact they are a Chinese berry we want to eliminate doubt from customers,' she said. 'We originally sourced [goji berries] from Australia and from the U.S., we've just removed that for the time being to maintain safety. 'We have never sourced our berries from China because we don't like the quality of them.' She added that Top Juice - which operates 35 stores in New South Wales and Victoria - sources its strawberries and blueberries from Australia, blackberries and boysenberries from New Zealand, cranberries from the U.S. and acai berries from Brazil.","450,000 people may have eaten  berries suspected of passing on Hepatitis A .

"Gone are the days when bigger meant better as many stars opted for subtle and sleek hairdos at last night's Oscars. When it comes to award ceremony hair understated appears to be popular, and last night's locks were classically beautiful, conforming to old world Hollywood glamour. The most favoured look appeared to be about keeping hair off the shoulders with Julianne Moore and Marion Cotillard opting for soft up-dos and Naomi Watts and Margot Robbie choosing the trendy LOB (long bob). Scroll down for video . When it came to red carpet trends off the shoulder hair won the style stakes with Marion Cotillard, Julianne Moore and Cate Blanchett opting for low slung buns and casual chignons . Celebrity hairdresser Matthew Curtis talks FEMAIL through the latest hair trends to hit the red carpet with his favourite (and not so favourite) looks of the evening. Anna Kendrick: Textured, glamorous pleat . Anna Kendrick's effortless pleat is a red carpet classic if a little 'safe' Anna sports a relaxed, textured effortless pleat which complements the simplicity of her beautiful coral dress. This season on the red carpet, as well as on the runways, we've seen an abundance of effortless and un-done styles, so Anna's choice is a great combination of on-trend and glamour, making it perfect for the Oscars. However, some critics might say she's played it a little safe, as the style is similar to her low twist chignon from last year's Oscars. Felicity Jones: Natural, soft bun . Felicty Jones' natural bun worked in favour of her dramatic dress choice . She may not have received the best reception for her choice in gown, but her natural soft bun is perfectly in keeping with runway styles for this spring and summer. Women that are wearing dresses with a high neckline want to embrace effortless, textured hair, as it avoids distracting too much from the dress. Rosamond Pike: Textured knotted 'un-do' Rosamund Pike won best hair in Matthew Curtis' books with her take on the Grecian up-do . Rosamond's look is without a doubt my favourite from this year's Oscars red carpet. It's a stunning transition from the overly done Grecian up-do, which we see far too often on the red carpet, into a more textured, knotted un-do. The texture running through the front of the hair keeps the style soft and elegant, allowing the knot at the back to be a little tighter. Gina Rodriguez: Off-balance chignon . Matthew wasn't keen on Gina's play-it-safe chignon as he says it has been overly set . Gina's hair is a play-safe chignon that hasn't quite gone to plan. The style for me is a little off balance to the one side and overly set. The look could have been made a little softer and elegant if there was more texture running through the front. with the bun positioned towards the nape of the neck. Unfortunately, for me, her deep blue gown and hair do not work together to create that wow factor we so want from the red carpet. Margot Robbie: On-trend sleek LOB . Margot Robbie's LOB (Long Bob) wins points in the trend stakes . This year already we've seen so many celebrity icons revamping their look from long styles to the on-trend, effortless LOB (Long Bob) - Rosie Huntington-Whitely and Kim Kardashian to name a few. Margot has worn this style straight with a deep side parting, keeping her look sophisticated and stunning, so that her natural beauty and her gorgeous red dress make the statement. Dakota Johnson: Simply pony . Dakota Johnson's simple pony tail was a bit of a let down at her first big awards ceremony . Wearing a simple ponytail can always be a risk at such a big awards ceremony. Although it's a versatile style, and one which is timeless, with so much anticipation about her red carpet arrival, could Dakota's look have been too simple this year? Opting for a straight pony, this look gives a nod to the Nineties' poker-straight trend that we are seeing more and more of. I like that she has kept the look delicate and feminine by simply wrapping a thin piece of hair around the elastic - a style which is easy to re-create at home and can be worn as a day look or straight out for dinner. Marion Cotillard: Effortless low bun . This look may look effortless but works well for awards seasons as it keeps the eye focused on the dress . A beautiful take a on a red carpet hair style which works well for the awards season, but also follows this seasons trend of a simple hair-up with a twist. The deep side parting, effortlessly twisted into a gorgeous low bun at the nape of the neck, complements the high line of Marion's white dress. Julianne Moore: Classic chignon . The chignon is always a favourite on the red carpet and one that is pretty fail safe . A great sleek chignon that's almost as timeless as the ponytail. This is a classic hairstyle that will always be red carpet worthy – Julianne's looks absolutely perfect for the red carpet. Naomi Watts: Nonchalant textured LOB . Naomi Watts gave the LOB an updated textured feel with her beachy waves . Also embracing the LOB, Naomi's Oscar style is such a wearable look that we will be seeing a lot more of in the world of film and fashion. Rather than wearing it sleek like Margot Robbie, Naomi's LOB has a nonchalant, textured feel to it. This look is super easy to re-create at home, using a curling wand on the mid-lengths of the hair, but leaving out the ends for a more lived-in feel. Sienna Miller: Twisted un-do . Sienna Miller's un-do is not to try hard but achieves an elegant finish . A simple but stunning and effective look. Sienna's beautifully twisted un-do, that's not overly polished, works perfectly with her Oscar de la Renta dress. Cate Blanchett: Grecian chignon . The textured Grecian look is a messier take on the classic red carpet chignon . A little too Grecian with the hair, but still working towards an on-trend, textured chignon, Cate is looking incredible as always. There is always a high expectation for Cate's red carpet look and she doesn't really ever get much wrong. Gwyneth Paltrow: Straight, slicked back . Matthew wasn't madly keen on Gwyneth Paltrow's 90s look as he believe it did not flatter the dress . Although Gwyneth is working the natural Nineties sleek and slicked back look, I don't feel this style complements her dress. A better look would had been a simple low twisted bun or ponytail, so that focus is on the detail of the dress. Reese Witherspoon: Confused hair . Matthew was not impressed with Reese Witherspoon's hair as he says it didn't look styled or natural . For me Reese has got it spot on with the dress, yet her hair doesn't seem to know whether it's supposed to be 'un-done' or 'done'. It's neither styled nor natural. If she hadn't gone for such a strong centre parting, but more of a deep side part, it would have given the look a softer and effortless feel which would have worked better for her.","The hair trend at the Oscars appeared to be understated .
Stars opted for low buns or natural bobs rather than over styled looks .

"Located on the outskirts of an idyllic Cheshire hamlet, the once grand Cledford Hall belonged to a wealthy Victorian farmer and landowner. But now the former mansion and an adjoining Grade II listed barn are due to undergo a £3.2million transformation into what has been described as a Butlin’s-style holiday camp for travellers. The plans have infuriated residents in the hamlet of Cledford, near Middlewich, who claim that with other such camps in the area already they are ‘being treated like the county dustbin’. Cheshire East council plans to turn Cledford Hall, a 200-year-old derelict building and grade II listed barn, into a toilet and shower facility for gipsies at a cost of £3.2million - locals have opposed the proposals . Council bosses, who say they are required by law to provide a transit site, want to demolish the run-down hall dating back to 1828 to provide nine transit pitches, a permanent warden’s pitch and a play area. The barn would become a washing and toilet block and have an office for the warden. Plans were stalled due to the Grade II listing of the hall, but the listing was cancelled after a fire three years ago. The camp has been approved by planners and will be considered by the full council next month. Residents fighting to stop the move include builder Bob Moody, 66, who has spent £120,000 renovating his ‘dream’ retirement cottage opposite the site entrance and fears the £250,000 property and others will be left worthless. He called the plans an ‘outrageous use of taxpayers’ money’, adding: ‘None of us can understand why the council should think it necessary to spend such a large amount of money providing a luxury Butlin’s-style holiday camp for travellers in such lovely countryside. Bob Moody has spent around £120,000 renovating his retirement cottage and said he believes the development is a waste of council money, will devalue his home and attract more gipsies to the area . Cledford Hall was previously listed but was taken off the register last year after a fire at the building . ‘These plans haven’t had a single letter of support and I’m led to believe there has even been an objection letter from other gipsies and travellers. There are already gipsy camps in the Middlewich area and it’s time some other towns bore some of this burden. We feel we are being treated like the county dustbin. My wife is devastated and can hardly talk about it.’ Neighbour Claire Bertram said: ‘The cost of the site is completely ridiculous.’ Trevor Ratcliffe, a website developer, said: ‘It’s disgusting that public money is being spent this way. The area is now becoming a travellers’ town.’ The property is part of the history of the area and dates back around 200 years but will be demolished . Bob Moody has launched a petition opposing the development, and is pictured outside his renovated home . Councillor Don Stockton, Cheshire East Council’s cabinet member for housing, said: ‘The site is designed to reduce the number of unauthorised encampments as these have a serious impact on residents and businesses. 'There were 81 unauthorised encampments last year and until we have a transit site in place the police cannot use their powers to move travellers on. ‘Local authorities have a duty to make every effort to bring dilapidated listed buildings back into use.’ Mr Moody said he has traveled several hundred miles in search of the perfect materials for his Victorian home . Villagers in Cledford have branded the cost of the scheme, likened to a Butlins holiday park, as ridiculous . The development was first proposed after a fire at the 19th century building destroyed the interior .","Cledford Hall, built in 1822, will be developed into facilities for gipsies .

"Betrayed: Beverley Neville found out her husband of 13 years was living a double life . Beverley Neville used to be thankful for her chauffeur husband who worked all the hours he could to pay the mortgage on the house they shared in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, after she was made redundant. Beverley, 58, believed that husband, Raymond, 55, often had to stay away from home as he worked night shifts and was regularly hired to drive to Cardiff. But she was shocked to discover her husband of 13 years was not the man she thought he was. In fact, many of the times he had stayed away 'working' he was actually seeing another woman. And Beverley was stunned to find out he wasn't just having an affair - he had committed bigamy by marrying the other woman after forging divorce papers. Recalling the events that led to her shocking discovery on today's This Morning, Beverley said: 'One of the times he told me he was away in Wales I became worried because I couldn't get hold of him for ten days. His mobile kept going straight to answerphone. 'I had started working as a carer then and by coincidence, the son of one of the ladies I looked after worked at the same chauffeur company. I asked him to try and contact Raymond and he did - on a different number to the one I had. 'Raymond was living a double life and had two mobile phones and he wasn't in Wales, he was in China.' Beverley confronted her husband when he returned home but he denied everything. He said his work was 'top secret' so he couldn't tell her where he had been. 'Oh so you're Pinocchio working for MI5 now?' she retorted at the time. Suspicious of what he had been up to, Beverley later checked her husband's emails - which she had access to, as she did his invoicing for him. This was how she discovered he was married to a Chinese nurse, April Chang, who he had set up home with less than 20 miles away in Harrow, North London. Beverley was stunned. She told presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford: 'I didn't know about his double life. I didn't have a clue as it was happening over a long period of time. If you married someone who is a chauffeur who does night work, how would you know any different?' Scroll down for video . Beverley told Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford on today's This Morning how she discovered her husband had married another woman by checking his emails after becoming suspicious of his behaviour . The betrayed wife revealed how things had started out so differently when she first met Raymond at a dance in 1997 and she had been instantly attracted to him. She recalled: 'When I first met him, I danced with him and he asked for my number. We got on really well and had the same interests, we both enjoyed dancing and going out, we were hunky dory.' Caught up in a whirlwind romance, Beverley said yes when Raymond proposed to her a year later. It was only after they tied the knot that it became apparent Raymond was prone to withholding the truth. He'd failed to tell Beverley that he had been married before and was a father. She said: 'I didn't know until after I married him that he had been married before and had children. He said if I found out he had children it might put me off.' Beverley said they were happily married for a time until she was made redundant and Raymond volunteered to start doing extra shifts, which meant he would be away from home more. Raymond Neville pictured with April Chang who he tied the knot with while still married to Beverley . Then in 2010, he came home and told Beverley about a money-making scheme he had heard about. 'One time he came home and told me about a friend who had a Chinese nurse for a girlfriend. She was struggling for a visa to stay in Britain and he couldn't ­marry her as his ­divorce hadn't come through,' she explained in an earlier interview in The Mirror. Beveley said she's now trying to move on with her life after her ex has been sentenced for his crimes . 'Raymond told me he was ­looking for someone else to marry her for a fee – just to keep her here. 'I thought it was really sad that someone was in that ­position, but even sadder ­anyone would be ­desperate enough for cash to marry someone they didn't love. 'I thought to myself: ""we may be poor, but I love my husband, and that's worth a lot""'.' But unbeknownst to Beverley, Raymond went on to marry Chinese nurse April himself in a £10,000 visa scam - and then he fell in love with her. They tied the knot at a registry office in Camden, North London, which Beverley only discovered two years later when she checked his email following his mysterious trip to China. April appeared to have no idea Raymond was still married as he had forged divorce documents to make their union possible. Beverley reported his bigamy to the police in fear that she may be accused of being involved in the visa scam. In December last year, Raymond admitted perjury, bigamy and making forged statements and was sentenced to nine months, suspended for 18 months. On This Morning, Beverley said while Raymond admitted his crimes in court (while the 'Chinese lady was in floods of tears'), he has yet to confess his crimes to her. 'Still to this day he hasn't admitted to me what he did and he showed no remorse in court, he didn't offer a word,' she said. She added that she's now trying to 'get on' with her life. 'I have to start again and keep myself busy and I have plenty of friends. I don't know if I would marry again.'","Beverley Neville, 58, from Herts, married Raymond, 55, in 1997 .

"Aaron Hernandez's housekeepers testified on Monday about finding guns in the 'man cave' of his home and how the ex-NFL star's fiancée threatened them with deportation if they cooperated with authorities following Odin Lloyd's murder. Marila Prinholato was the first cleaner to take the stand on Monday. She testified that she cleaned at the North Attleboro mansion in Massachusetts every Tuesday for up to seven hours. She said that she would sometimes smell 'marijuana' at the home and that the bed in the 'man cave' appeared to have been slept in on several occasions. Scroll down for video . Marila Prinholato (pictured left) testified on Monday about finding two guns at Aaron Hernandez's Massachusetts home in 2013. Grazielli Silva, who ran the cleaning company, also testified . Defense attorney Charles Rankin, right, cross-examines a witness during the murder trial for former NFL player Aaron Hernandez, left, on Monday in Fall River, Massachusetts . Ms Prinholato also testified that during one round of cleaning, a gun fell out from under the mattress. The cleaner then testified that a different weapon fell out of Hernandez's pants pocket when a colleague went to hang them up. She added that she saw both guns at the home on the seven occasions she worked there. Ms Prinholato told the jury that after Odin Lloyd was found murdered on June 17, 2013, around a mile from Hernandez's home, the Pats star and his fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, put pressure on her to sign a legally-binding confidentially document. She did not sign it. Hernandez betrayed little emotion as he watched the witnesses testify in court on Monday. Odin Lloyd's mother, Ursula Ward, was also in the public gallery at the Bristol County Superior Court in Fall River, as she has been each day since the start of trial. Hernandez's defense attorney, Michael Fee, then got up to cross-examine Ms Prinholato. Fee said that the confidentiality agreement was given to Ms Prinholato before the murder and that the defendant had passed along one he got from another Pats player. Grazielli Silva, who ran the cleaning company used by Hernandez, then took the stand. Ms Grazi said that she learned of the confidentiality agreement three weeks before the murder but did not receive the form until after the shooting death of Lloyd. Like her colleague, she didn't sign it. Hernandez's lawyer then asked Ms Grazi about her U.S. immigration status to which she confirmed she was illegal. The defense then asked if she thought cooperating with prosecutors would help her stay in the U.S .

Defense attorney Michael Fee quizzed Aaron Hernandez's former cleaner, Grazielli Silva, in court on Monday speculating that she was cooperating with prosecutors in the trial because of her illegal immigration status . At the beginning of court proceedings on Monday, witnesses heard loud bangs that sounded like fireworks in a Massachusetts industrial park where the bullet-riddled body of a man ex-NFL star Aaron Hernandez is accused of fatally shooting was found hours later, they testified on Monday. Two employees of Needletech Products Inc, a surgical needle manufacturing company in North Attleborough, Massachusetts, said they heard the sounds between 3am and 3.30am on June 17, 2013, during breaks from their overnight shifts at the company. 'I heard a loud bang, four or five times,' said Barbara Chan, a Needletech machine operator who had been taking a nap in her car. 'I thought it was fireworks... It was two slow ones and three fast ones.' Another Needletech employee, Michael Ribeiro, was listening to the radio in his pickup truck outside the company's facility when he said he heard 'a loud banging sound, like fireworks going off'. The body of Odin Lloyd, a semiprofessional football player who had been dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancée, was found by a teenage jogger a short distance away later that day. Lloyd, 27, had been shot six times and police found five empty .45-caliber shell casings nearby. Odin Lloyd's body was found with gunshot wounds in an industrial park in June 2013 . A single .45-caliber shell was found in a dumpster at a rental car agency, removed from a car Hernandez returned. Authorities have not located the gun used in the slaying. Hernandez, who lived less than a mile from the industrial park, has been charged with Lloyd's murder and various firearms offenses. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of life in prison. Hernandez, 25, had a $41 million contract with the New England Patriots when he was cut from the team shortly after being arrested in June 2013. Prosecutors contend Hernandez and two friends, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, picked up Lloyd at his Boston home in the early hours of June 17, 2013, before driving him to the industrial area where his body was found. Wallace and Ortiz also have been charged and will be tried separately. All three men have pleaded not guilty. Associate Justice Susan Garsh reconsidered an earlier ruling to exclude text messages between Lloyd and his sister, saying the sister could testify that texts were sent at certain times, but not about their contents. Hernandez will face a second trial later this year on charges he killed two Cape Verdean men outside a Boston nightclub in 2012.","Marila Prinholato testified on Monday that she had found two different weapons while cleaning at Hernandez' North Attleboro home .

"Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is learning that major leagues pitchers throw harder than in the minors, as journalists are piling on the newly minted Republican front-runner – first with gotcha questions and now with questions about an abortion flip-flop over a period of just four months. The New York Times highlighted on Monday a campaign ad Walker made in October as he fought through a tough re-election contest. 'I'm pro-life,' he says in the video, but Walker also announced his support for 'legislation to increase safety, and to provie more information to a woman considering her options. The bill leaves the final decision to a woman and her doctor.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . FRONT-RUNNER: Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has surged to the front of the GOP presidential pack, opening him up to instant media slaps about inconsistencies in his political record . FOUR MONTHS AGO: Walker made a campaign ad in October 2014 saying he supported legislation that would keep abortion legal, albeit 'safer,' although he insisted he was pro-life . POLITICAL MINEFIELD: Pro-life partisans make up a large part of the Republican electorate that will decide who is nominated for president next year – and they could stay home on Election Day if a pro-choice candidate is named . But last month, according to a witness who spoke with The New York Times, Walker met privately with potential donors to his nascent presidential campaign and boasted that he supported a 'personhood amendment' – which holds that human life begins at conception and practicaly bans abortions along with so-called 'morning after contraceptives.' His evolution from a blue-state governor to a potential GOP primary winner is similar to that of Mitt Romney four years ago: Walker must straddle between his moderate positions at home and the need to appeal to the Republican Party's evangelical Christian base. Abortion is one of America's most hotly contested and emotionally charged political issues. Entire lobbying industries have sprung up to defend abortion clinics – especially those run by the moneyed Planned Parenthood – and to push a rollback of the 1973 'Roe v. Wade' Supreme Court decision that enshrined the practice in American law. Walker delivered a breakout Jan. 24 speech In Iowa, crescendoing on a boast that he had 'defunded Planned Parenthood' in hist state's budgets, something that GOP conservatives wand to see replicated at the federal level. But in October he dodged questions from The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel about his support for a proposed 'partial birth' abortion ban – a law that would prohibit terminating a pregnancy that was more than 20 weeks old. The Times reports that Walker has also expressed a  preference for abortion bans even in cases of incest and rape. In his Iowa speech, he he drew loud applause from a red-meat audience when he recalled signing 'pro-life legislation.' AMERICAN CROSSROADS: The battle over abortion continues to hold Americans' attention and generate protests more than 40 years after it came to a head in the Supreme Court . WALKER'S HOME STATE: University students and staff braved cold weather this month to protest Walker's proposal to cut state spending on higher education . Walker is learly a front-runner, more than 16 months from the Cleveland, Ohio convention that will annoint a GOP presidential nominee. One surprise poll result, published Monday, has him in a statistical tie for the lead with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the lone-star state, one of America's largest and most conservative political strongholds. Cruz attracted 20 per cent of support from Texas Republicans, followed by Walker with 19. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, favored by moderates and already lapping the field in fundraising, was a distant third with just 9 per cent. Uber-conservative doctor Ben Carson came in with the same number. Walker is expected to give Bush a run for his donors' money, potentially representing a political consensus between the establishment and the right wing. FLIP-FLOPPER? Walker isn't the only public figure to have a change of heart on abortion: Norma McCorvey, the 'Jane Roe' in 'Roe v. Wade' who sued for her right to have an abortion, is now an anti-abortion activist . 'I think he’s going to make the case we nominate the most conservative person possible who has the ability to win in a general election,' Republican Party of South Carolina chairman Matt Moore told the Times. Walker's team is already learning how to make hay when reporters ambush him with emotionally charged questions deigned to throw him off-balance. Fundraising emails went out shortly after The Washington Post cornered him on Friday by asking if he thought President Barack Obama is a Christian. By Sunday night his appeal for money pledged that Walker 'refuses to be distracted by the small, petty, and pale ideas that the ""gotcha"" headline writers for the Liberal Media want to talk about.'","In October the Wisconsin governor pledged to support legislation focused on 'safety' during abortions .

"Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani may have come under fire for saying that President Barack Obama does not love America, but he has at least one 12-year-old backer in Georgia. Middle school student CJ Pearson made a YouTube video in which he said that the commander in chief had a 'downright hate for the American values our country holds'. The video, posted Saturday on his channel, has garnered more than 112,000 views as of Sunday night. CJ Pearson, a 12-year-old from Georgia, posted a video backing former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani's comments criticizing President Obama's . The middle schooler said the president is 'not willing to defend our country against the evil of terrorism domestic and abroad' A 'public figure' page for the student says he has 'considered himself a conservative since the mere age of 8, supporting John McCain in his 2008 Presidential Campaign'. He said in his video that if Obama really loved America he would call Islamic State 'what it really is, an assault on Christianity' The student added that the president, who has ordered airstrikes on ISIS and asked for approval to send limited ground troops, was 'not willing to defend our country against the evil of terrorism domestic and abroad'. The student said that the president 'wouldn't try to take away what hard working Americans have worked for their entire lives' and 'wouldn't take away the rights of the American people'. Giuliani has said that he stands by his comments made last week. However, he wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal saying that he 'didn’t intend to question President Obama’s motives or the content of his heart'. Giuliani wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal saying that he didn't want to question Obama's motives or heart . He said it was weak, however, to show 'any reluctance to hold up America and its ideals in contrast to the nation’s enemies'. The former mayor also criticized Obama's comments about torture and American exceptionalism. Republicans such  Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who sat next to the former mayor when he made the comments, have been asked to follow up on the original remarks. The possible presidential candidate said he didn't know if Obama loved his country or if he was Christian, despite the president repeatedly talking about his faith. Other conservative figures have tried to distance themselves from Giuliani. Indiana Governor Mike Pence, another potential candidate for a 2016 White House run, said 'I don't think it helps to question the president's patriotism' on Fox News Sunday. The Midwestern governor criticized Obama for being 'fully willing to lecture the people of this country about the crusades, but is unwilling to call Islamic extremism for what it is'. Indiana Governor Mike Pence said that questioning the patriotism of Obama (pictured at the 2015 Governors Dinner) was not helpful .","CJ Pearson said president 'not willing to defend our country'

Within hours she had activated an emergency beacon amid but a team was unable to locate her in the blizzard because mountaineers say the sub-zero temperatures prevented it from working properly. Her body was discovered 24 hours later, with emergency responders being sent in the wrong direction by the faulty technology. Others have said it was 'negligent' for her to be up there and her decisions showed her 'inexperience'. Tragic: BNP Paribas credit trader Kate Matrosova, 32, was found dead 24 hours after she called for help as she hiked up Mount Madison . Married: Matrosova was dropped off at the range at 5am on Sunday by husband Charlie Farhoodi (left) who is listed on LinkedIn as the Vice President of JP Morgan. The couple shared a $1 million apartment in Manhattan . Emergency: A search team was unable to locate Matrosova (pictured in January) for 24 hours after her call . When she activated the tracking device, it triggered an instantaneous alert at Tyndall Air Force Base in Panama City, Florida. Operators called the number associated with account, but it went straight to voicemail because her phone was switched off. It meant no one dialed 911 until her husband, who was sitting in his hotel room at the time, was contacted by staff at the Florida base. Volunteer mountain rescuer Steve Larson told the Boston Globe if they had Mastrova's correct location they would not have spent hours trekking through the woodland in the wrong direction. 'One lesson in all this, for all of this whiz-bang technology, it obviously is not spot-on,' he said. Fish and Game Lieutenant Wayne Saunders said her beacon was designed to function in temperatures as low as minus 20. But he said the air was far colder, meaning it could have tricked the technology. Mike Pelchat, a states park employee, added: 'Maybe she relied a little too much on the technology. Maybe she thought she could turn back. But the temperatures, and the wind, got the best of her.' Max Lurie, 28, who responded to the second Mountain Rescue Service call, told the Globe: 'It was cold — one of the coldest nights of the year — and the wind was howling. I don’t go up there when there are conditions like that. 'It was negligent for her to be up there. Her decision clearly speaks to her inexperience.' Grueling: Mt Madison (pictured, not with Matrosova) was hit by 100 mph winds and a blizzard on Sunday night . She had been attempting to climb the Presidential Range of the White Mountains - which includes the highest peak in the Northeast - Mount Washington - elevation 6,300 feet . Russia-born Matrosova, who lived in a $1 million apartment in Midtown Manhattan with Farhoodi, planned to climb to the top of  Madison before venturing across three other summits in the so-called Presidential Range, reports claim. As the day progressed, the region was hit by winds exceeding 100mph and temperatures plummeted to -30F. The BNP Paribas credit trader  sent her coordinates to rescuers on Sunday afternoon. After a failed attempt on Sunday, a National Guard crew flew over the area with a helicopter on Monday morning but couldn't see anything because of blowing snow and had to turn back. 'Unfortunately, a lot of the coordinates that we received over the night were all over the place within a mile circumference,' Fish and Game Lt. Jim Goss told WMUR-TV. Mount Madison is part of a series of summits named after presidents and other prominent Americans, which is collectively called the Presidential Range. She was found between Mt Madison and Mt Adams (top right), believed to have died from exposure to the cold . Plans: Authorities say Matrosova planned to climb all four peaks of the Presidential Range on her own . Matrosova, whose full name is Ekaterina, hailed from Omsk, Russia, before moving to Chicago to study in 2002 . Matrosova's Facebook showed her to be very active, with numerous images of hikes and white water rafting . According to WMUR-TV, Matrosova was going to venture through Mount Adams, Mount Jefferson and Mount Washington after reaching the top of Mount Madison. She found between Mount Madison and Mount Adams. A team made up of Fish and Game officers, Mountain Rescue Services members and Androscoggin Valley Search and Rescue members braved 108mph winds and frigid temperatures to reach the area. 'I guess if you are gonna hike in this type of weather you need to be in a more sheltered area, not up on an open exposed ridgeline,' Goss said. 'There's just no room for error in a place like that.' It is believed Matrosova, whose full name is Ekaterina Matrosova, hailed from Omsk in Russia before moving to Chicago to study in 2002. She completed a Bachelor of Science majoring in Finance and Marketing at Chicago's DePaul University in 2006. Matrosova's first job was with JP Morgan as a financial analyst, before moving to Beach Capital Management where she reached the role of Investment Adviser. In 2012, she attended Harvard University Extension School to study Numerical Analysis before obtaining a masters in financial engineering from the University of California, Berkeley's Haas School of Business in 2013. Vice President: Widower Charlie Farhoodi's job on LinkedIn is listed as Vice President of JP Morgan . Tribute: This picture was posted on Facebook in tribute to Matrosova with a friend called her 'a vibrant spirit' After interning for a year at BNP Paribas, she accepted the role of Credit Trading Associate in August 2014. Based on Facebook pictures, she appeared to be very active, with numerous images of hikes and white water rafting. Her interests are listed on LinkedIn as mountain climbing, judo and scuba diving. Friends and relatives paid tribute to Matrosova online, posting pictures of the 32-year-old. One wrote: 'Rest in peace...' with a photograph of Matrosova hiking through sunlight snowy woodland. Another described her as 'a vibrant spirit'. A blizzard watch was issued for coastal New England over the weekend that touched on the edge of the White Mountain National Forest, which encompasses the Presidential Range. The region saw up to 14 inches of snow in some areas.","Kate Matrosova, 32, found dead in New Hampshire mountains last Monday .

"Four new mysterious giant craters have appeared in the Siberian permafrost in northern Russia, sparking fears that global warming may be causing gas to erupt from underground. Scientists spotted the new holes, along with dozens of other smaller ones, in the same area as three other enormous craters that were spotted on the Yamal Peninsula last year. The craters are thought to be caused by eruptions of methane gas from the permafrost as rising rising temperatures causes the frozen soil to melt. Scroll down for video . Unexplained: The first of the new craters discovered, named B1 (pictured above), shows signs of an huge eruption of gas . It has sparked fears that the craters could become more common as climate change continues to warm and led to warnings that the area is facing a looming natural disaster. One of the more popular theories is that the giant hole was caused by a phenomenon known as a pingo. This is a subsurface accumulation of ice that has been covered by land. When the ice melts it can leave behind a gaping hole that it once filled. The other favoured theory is that the hole was caused by an explosion of methane underground. TheYamal Peninsula is rich in natural gas, and a mixture of water, salt and gas could result in an explosion. However in an article for Drilling and Oil magazine, Professor Bogoyavlensky there were no traces of the gas found in the soil nor were there any charred rock. Instead he suggests it could also have been caused by an eruption of gas from the underground reservoir, possibly as pressure has increased as temperatures have risen. The other theory is that it was caused by a meteorite, but most experts have ruled this possibility out as the phenomenon does not resemble normal impact craters. One of new craters, surrounded by at least 20 smaller holes, is just six miles from a major gas production plant. Experts have predicted there could be up to 30 more are waiting to be discovered. Scientsts, however, are still largely baffled by the exact processes causing the craters. Professor Vasily Bogoyavlensky, deputy director of the Moscow-based Oil and Gas Research Institute, part of the Russian Academy of Sciences, has called for 'urgent' investigation of the new phenomenon amid safety fears. Until now, the existence of only three Siberian craters had been established when great caverns in the frozen landscape were spotted by passing helicopter pilots. 'We know now of seven craters in the Arctic area,' Professor Bogoyavlensky told The Siberian Times. 'Five are directly on the Yamal peninsula, one in Yamal Autonomous district, and one is on the north of the Krasnoyarsk region, near the Taimyr peninsula. 'We have exact locations for only four of them. 'The other three were spotted by reindeer herders. 'But I am sure that there are more craters on Yamal, we just need to search for them. I would compare this with mushrooms. 'When you find one mushroom, be sure there are few more around. I suppose there could be 20 to 30 craters more.' Two of the newly-discovered large craters - also known as funnels to scientists - have turned into lakes, revealed Professor Bogoyavlensky. 'It is important not to scare people, but this is a very serious problem. 'We must research this phenomenon urgently to prevent possible disasters. We cannot rule out new gas emissions in the Arctic and in some cases they can ignite.' Explosion? This crater (named B3) was spotted near to Antipayuta in the Yamal Peninsula after locals saw a flash of light nearby . This map shows the location of the new craters (labelled B1-4) along with the previously discovered holes marked with black dots . The top satellite image shows an accumulation of ice beneath the surface, known as a pingo, while a more recent image shows a lake has formed in a crater scientists have called B2, surrounded by smaller holes . Professor Bogoyavlensky said that the parapet of the craters suggested an eruption of gas from a shallow underground reservoir. The first hole was spotted in 2013 by helicopter pilots 20 miles from a gas extraction plant at Bovanenkovo, on the Yamal Peninsula. An examination of the area using satellite images, comparing landscapes in the past with the present day, has alerted Russian experts to the prospect that the phenomenon is more widespread than first thought. Abyss: This crater, called B1, was first spotted 18 miles (30 km) from the Bovanenkovo by passing helicopter pilots . Simmering: Methane gas can be seen bubbling up out of this lake in the Yamal region and is thought to be an old crater . Experts are particularly interested in a crater they have named B2, which just six miles to the south of the Gazprom gas field at Bovanenkovo. Old satellite imagery shows no sign of craters at the site but more recent images show there is now a lake there measuring about 5,000 square metres. The lake is thought to have formed in a hole that is 100 metres by 50 metres in diametre and is surrounded by 20 smaller holes filled with water that are around one to two metres wide. Residents living near to another of the craters, close to Antipayuta on the Yamal Peninsula, reported seeing a flash of light. This has led some to conclude that it was the result of gas trapped in the permafrost exploding. Professor Bogoyavlensky said: 'We need to answer now the basic questions: what areas, and under what conditions, are the most dangerous? Last year scientists took a closer look at one of the older craters by climbing 54 feet down its frozen sides . When this crater was discovered in 2014, theories ranged from a man-made hoax, to aliens or a meteorite . 'These questions are important for the safe operation of the northern cities and infrastructure of oil and gas complexes.' There is already scientific concern that Lake Baikal, the largest and oldest freshwater lake in the world, but well outside the Arctic Circle, could be at risk of similar gas explosions. Scientists have previously said there is growing evidence that rising temperatures in the region could be the main catalyst triggering the blasts. It is thought permafrost at the sites could have one million times more methane hydrates locked inside than ordinary gas. One expert estimated that the total explosive power of the craters has been the equivalent of about 11 tonnes of TNT. Scientists are attempting to visit all of the craters, like above, to better understand how they were formed . In the winter the sides of the craters freeze, like above, making it easier for scientists to take samples . There are also two tectonic fault lines across the Yamal Peninsula, with another possibility being that the blow-outs are caused by a deadly combination of heat leaving these rifts, a higher than normal air temperature, and the 'fire ice' melting. Professor Bogoyavlensky revealed one picture of a Yamal lake showing signs of what he calls 'degassing'. 'This haze that you see on the surface shows gas seeps from the bottom of the lake to the surface,' he said. 'We call this process 'degassing'.' He is not sure if this lake, too, was previously a crater 'or if the lake formed from another process. 'More important is that the gases from within are actively seeping through this lake.'","Four new craters have been spotted by scientists in the Yamal peninsula, in Siberia .

"A dog found frozen to the ground in Ecorse, Michigan, last Tuesday is lucky to be alive but may yet loose a leg or two due to her owner's cruelty . Elsa, a 10-year-old chow mix, was rushed to Healthy Paws Medical Center  after a Good Samaritan spotted the poor animal suffering in freezing conditions and called for help. According to rescuers from the local animal shelter it took them 30 minutes to free Elsa from the icy ground.

The 10-year-old chow mix, who was found frozen to the ground last Tuesday, is lucky to be alive but may yet loose a leg or two due to her owner's cruelty . 'They had to pour warm water on her. Her two legs were frozen. The side of her face and her side, she was literally laying [sic] frozen to the ground,' Patricia Trevino of the River Rouge Animal Shelter told FOX 2. The temperature was five degrees with a windchill of -10 on Tuesday morning at 10 a.m. when the rescuers arrived, but they don't know how long the animal was left outside. Elsa's owners had cruelly wrapped her leash around her which had prevented her from being able to reach either food, water or shelter. 'The dog was incoherent, was not responsive. She didn't start crying until the water was poured on her,' said Trevino. Elsa suffered frost bite to her ears and feet, with her toes were frozen together so that they bleed when she tried to walk on them after she had been revived . Elsa suffered frost bite to her ears and feet, with her toes were frozen together so that they bleed when she tried to walk on them after she had been revived. According to Trevino, Elsa isn't out of the woods just yet and could lose a leg or two. FOX 2 reports that the veterinarian who had been working to save Elsa was too overwhelmed to speak on camera about what the dog had suffered. Healthy Paws are taking donations over the phone as they battle to save Else. 'It's going to pay her bill so she can be treated and stay here as long as she needs to stay until she recovers,' said Trevino. The dog's owners have been charged with cruelty and are due to appear in court.","Elsa was rushed to Healthy Paws Medical Center after a Good Samaritan spotted the poor animal suffering in freezing conditions and called for help .

'I felt the charge come from my back down to my leg and it contracted and [my leg] was pulled back and I was blown away, I was like ""woah"". We found out later on that I could stand. 'I could not only pull my my left leg back, I could also move my toes, I could move my ankles, I could do the same thing on the right side as I could on the left side, I could extend my legs.' He added: 'I feel extremely blessed to be able to be a part of this program. It's hard to really find a word that describes how great - I mean, it's really unbelievable. I can actually do it.' Although experts have said Mr Stephenson's movement is promising, they have warned that the treatment isn't a cure. The patient still cannot walk and has to use a wheelchair to get around. Mr Stephenson, a former ProAm motocross racer, was attempting an 80-foot jump in Kaufman County when his bike locked up and he crashed to the ground on June 9, 2009, according to KLTV.

'I was trying to catch fifth gear on a certain section of the track and I finally did it. Then I started going off the face of the jump and the bike locked up,' said Mr Stephenson. 'I was just kind of going through the air and it was just nose down. I tried to jump away from it … Then we landed on the front and did lots of cartwheels and somersaults.' Speaking to the Reeve Foundation, he added: 'I knew instantly that I couldn't feel my legs. The doctors explained that... there was basically no hope for me to regain any mobility or movement.' Mr Stephenson, who had cracked one of his vertebrae and practically exploded another one in the crash, underwent surgery at Parkland Hospital in Dallas to fuse part of his spine together.

"Utah cancer researcher Uta von Schwedler was found dead with wounds that pointed to a homicide, but she also had a fatal level of the anti-anxiety drug Xanax in her system that made her death a mystery, a medical examiner testified Monday. Prosecutors charged her 51-year-old ex-husband John Brickman Wall with murder after saying he killed von Schwedler during a bitter custody battle in 2011. However, assistant medical examiner Erik Christensen stopped short of ruling her death a homicide or suicide. Accusations: John Brickman Wall, pictured center in court on Monday, is currently standing trial for the murder of his ex-wife Uta von Schwedler . Suicide or homicide? Von Schwedler was a cancer researcher. She was found dead in her bathtub in 2011 from knife wounds and a Xanax overdose . Mystery: Assistant medical examiner Erik Christensen said in court on Monday that the Xanax in Von Schwedler's system was a mystery - no pill fragments were found in her stomach and there were no wounds on the skin to suggest she was injected . 'If she had no Xanax in her system I would have certified this death a homicide,' Christensen testified at the murder trial of Wall. Xanax is generally difficult to overdose on and isn't available in a liquid form that could be forcibly injected, he said. Suspicious: In court on Monday, the medical examiner testified that it's difficult to overdose on Xanax - suggesting she was force fed the depression drug . 'She just happened to take this and happened to be killed the same night? That doesn't really make sense,' the medical examiner said. Von Schwedler didn't have a history of anxiety or depression, or a prescription for Xanax. Other experts said the drug could make someone more relaxed and less likely to fight back while taking up to an hour to have an effect. In the months after von Schwedler's death, her family called for more investigation, and the couple's oldest son fueled speculation by saying he thought his father killed his mother. Wall was arrested and charged with murder in April 2013, nearly 18 months after her death. His trial, expected to last a month, began last week. Wall's defense attorneys say von Schwedler took the Xanax herself, and cut her own arms and legs before her death. Under questioning from defense lawyer G. Fred Metos, Christensen acknowledged that it's possible the cuts were self-inflicted, and that the leg is an unusual place for a defensive wound. He also said he would typically expect more wounds if she was fighting for her life. Christensen had enough doubts about the case that he went to back to police to ask what else they had found during their investigation, but he was initially told the case was closed. Other officers did go back and do more investigation, but the case against Wall remains largely circumstantial. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","John Brickman Wall is currently standing trial for the murder of his ex-wife, cancer researcher Uta von Schwedler .

"An Oscar winner admitted that he tried to kill himself when he was 16 and urged kids who feel different to 'stay weird' as he accepted the award. Graham Moore took the opportunity to raise awareness about depression and suicide when he collected the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for the Imitation Game. The Columbia University graduate first paid tribute to Alan Turing, the subject of the film who solved the Enigma code, as he had never received recognition for his achievements while he was alive. Moving: Graham Moore, who won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay said: 'I tried to commit suicide at 16 and now I'm standing here' The writer then said: 'I tried to commit suicide at 16 and now I'm standing here. I would like for this moment to be for that kid out there who feels like she doesn't fit in anywhere. 'You do. Stay weird. Stay different, and then when it's your turn and you are standing on this stage please pass the same message along.' After the war Turing was prosecuted for homosexuality. He killed himself at the age of 41 in 1954. Since his death, his discovery of the code has been credited as one of the main reason's Allied forces were able to defeat Hitler's army. He was never recognized for his achievements while he was alive and was pardoned posthumously for his crime. Earlier in the evening, another reference to suicide was included in an acceptance speech when Dana Perry mentioned that her son had killed himself. Perry made her comments in accepting the Oscar for best documentary for 'Crisis Hotline: Veterans Press 1.' 'We should talk about suicide out loud,' she said.

Reaching out: The screenwriter urged children who felt left out: 'Stay weird. Stay different, and then when it's your turn and you are standing on this stage please pass the same message along' According to BuzzFeed, Moore grew up on the north side of Chicago, the son of two lawyers who divorced and then married two other lawyers. In an interview with the site he described how he started writing at the end of college and came up the an idea for a screenplay while out drinking with his friend Ben Epstein, who was at New York University film school at the time. He said: 'It was one of those nights where you tell a joke, and you tell it again, and the joke gets funnier as the night goes along, even though it might never have been that funny to start with. But it was an idea for a comedy. 'I hadn’t written fiction since a couple short stories in high school, but he was in film school so he wanted to write movies.' Moore's debut novel, The Sherlockian, was a New York Times best seller in 2010.","Graham Moore spoke as he collected Best Adapted Screenplay award .

"Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne has joked about his struggle with alcoholism but insisted he hasn't fallen off the wagon despite being pictured popping into an off-licence recently. The 47-year-old, who was briefly sectioned for his own safety in October, appeared in good health as he appeared on BT Sport's Matchday Live With Fletch and Sav show yesterday. Touching on his lengthy battle with drink and drugs, the former Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle midfielder joked: 'I've been on a whiskey diet – I lost three days!' Scroll down for videos . Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne appeared in good spirits on BT Sport's Fletch and Sav show . The 47-year-old appeared healthy with glowing skin and an eccentric grey beard during yesterday's TV stint . Gascoigne, who retired from football in 2004, was joined by fellow guest Russell Brand on the show and opened up about his struggles with alcoholism. He even joked: 'I've been on a whiskey diet – I lost three days' The star, who put his recent stint in hospital following an apparent alcohol binge down to 'just to a little blip', insisted photos of him shopping in a off-licence last month didn't mean he had resorted to his old habits. He told TV presenters Robbie Savage and Darren Fletcher: 'I was only buying cigarettes.' Gascoigne, who retired from football in 2004, was spotted emerging from a branch of Oddbins in Poole, Dorset, in his slippers in January. Wearing an oversized sheepskin coat, yellow t-shirt and jeans, he kept a carrier bag hidden as he left the convenience store. And in December last year, he was spotted popping to an off-licence in east London, although it wasn't clear whether he bought anything at the store. A month earlier he was pictured looking downcast as he put the bins out in front his property in the wealthy Sandbanks area of Poole, Dorset, wearing a blue dressing gown, tartan pyjama bottoms and slip-on shoes. Despite his previous public struggles with alcoholism, Gascoigne appeared happy and relaxed on the sport show yesterday and teamed his new healthy, glowing appearance with an eccentric grey beard. Gascoigne's fellow guests on the BT Sport Fletch and Sav show included Rio Ferdinand and Russell Brand . All eyes in the star-studded north London studio were on Gascoigne during the rare TV appearance . As well as making light of his dark times, the footballer also touched on the struggles of being in the spotlight. He told fellow guests Jimmy Greaves and Russell Brand how his fundamental aim on a football pitch was to 'entertain the fans, win them over', but admitted that sometimes it all became too intense for him. He also admitted that even today 'it's sometimes hard to go to games' because he ends up 'analysing myself.' He added: 'I drive myself nuts. What would I have done there?' It prompted comedian Brand, who has also struggled with alcohol and drug addiction in the past, to reassure the footballing great. He turned to Gascoigne and told him 'the greatness is still in you,' before adding: 'You mustn't feel sad. You've given the game so much.' Brand later said of the former footballer: 'He transcends clubs and football because he was such a beautiful player and a genius.' Comedian and West Ham fan Russell Brand tweeted this picture of himself and Ian Wright giving Paul Gascoigne a kiss after the trio appeared on BT Sport's Matchday Live with Fletch and Sav on Sunday . TV presenter Gary Lineker took to Twitter to make a series of positive comments about Gascoigne's interview . Gascoigne's rare television appearance also appeared to be well-received by fans. TV presenter Gary Lineker took to Twitter to make a series of positive comments about his interview. He wrote: 'Gazza is on @FletchAndSav on @btsport and seems in good form. Now that fella could really play. 'Gazza was so good and loved having the ball so much he'd only pass it to you if you had no choice but to give it straight back to him.' He later added: 'Great to see Gazza in such sparkling form. Love the lunatic.' The former professional footballer's appearance on the show is one of his rare public outings since his hospitalisation in October last year, during which he was placed on a three-day emergency detox. Gascoigne was spotted shuffling out of his local off-licence in a pair of slippers in January. Despite keeping the carrier bag hidden from view, he said during yesterday's TV interview that he had just bought cigarettes . The former England, Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle footballer was also spotted emerging from an off-licence in east London in December last year. However, it was clear in the photos that he didn't buy booze . Last year, the ex-footballer was spotted looking downcast as he put the bins out outside his home in the wealthy Sandbanks area of Poole, Dorset, wearing a blue dressing gown, tartan pyjama bottoms and slippers . The star, who made 57 appearances for England, was first sectioned under the Mental Health Act in 2008 following an incident at a Newcastle hotel. His latest sectioning in the early hours of October 24 came following an apparent alcohol binge. During his time in hospital, he is said to have taken the opportunity to improve his health and fitness by doing up to 800 press-ups, sit-ups and squats every day. Gascoigne, who now prays every morning, claimed he had only drunk for one year out of the last 18 and admitted he was lucky to have nipped his relapses in the bud quickly. Last month, he admitted that 'the only person who can save me is me', and vowed to stay on the straight and narrow after listening to doctors' warnings that alcohol will kill him.

"A man has been accused of luring a six-year-old girl into his motel room with snacks, throttling her, and then stuffing her body under his bed. John P Roberts, 55, was charged with the murder of schoolgirl Jasmine Miller this weekend, after she went missing in Branson, Missouri. A probable cause statement said her lifeless body was found under the bed in Roberts's room, in the same long-stay motel where Jasmine's family were living. Scroll down for video . 'Lured and strangled': John P Roberts, left, allegedly tricked six-year-old Jasmine Miller, right, into coming into his motel room, then strangled her and hid the body under the bed . 'Sweet girl': Neighbors described how Jasmine was compassionate and comforted an ill neighbor after he was too weak to push his children on a swing set . Jasmine's family reported her missing Saturday night, and officers searching the roadside lodgings at the Windsor Inn found her soon after. Police said in a news release that they believe he acted alone. Roberts was already on bail after being charged with a burglary - which he has claimed he committed so he could afford to eat. Roberts remained jailed without bond Monday in Taney County after making his first court appearance on a first-degree murder charge in Jasmine's death. Roberts met with his public defender and was scheduled to appear in court next on March 10, online court records show. They do not identify the public defender. Neighbors described Jasmine as a sweet girl who was eager to help other people. Paul Dubois, a cancer sufferer whose daughter was friends with Jasmine, described how she consoled him in a park after his illness left him too weak to push his kids on the swings. He said: 'She hugged me and said it doesn't matter the fact that I can't do what other parents can do.' Hotel: Taney County Prosecutor Jeffrey M. Merrell has said it seemed both Miller and Roberts were Windsor Inn guests . At the same time, other residents at the motel were shocked that Roberts could be a murderer. Kristen Patteron, who said she spoke to Roberts every day, told local TV station KSPR:  'He would help out with anything anybody asked him to.' She told the television station: 'I couldn't believe that he would do something like that - I would have never imagined him to even have that kind of a thought in his head to do something like that. Windsor Inn resident Tammy Meyer said her children played with Jasmine, and she and her 17-year-old daughter helped search for the girl before she was found. Judson Wall, who is representing Roberts in the burglary case, was not available for comment.","John P Roberts allegedly used snacks to tempt Jasmine Miller into room .

"Caught: 36-year-old Joseph M. Bekken was charged Thursday in 1st District Court with attempting to procure a prostitute, attempting to misuse public money, bribery, using a computer in a scheme to defraud and burglary . The former financial aid director at North Idaho College is accused of offering scholarship money to students in exchange for sex. Joseph M. Bekken, 36, was charged Thursday in 1st District Court with attempting to procure a prostitute, attempting to misuse public money, bribery, using a computer in a scheme to defraud and burglary. Bekken, a married father of four who has been fired, was being held in the Kootenai County Jail on $100,000 bail on the felony charges. 'This is conduct that has been going on for many, many years,' Kootenai County Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Jedediah Whitaker told Judge Scott Wayman. Whitaker said that Bekken came to North Idaho College in 2010 from his previous job as a financial aid counselor at Grand Canyon University in Phoenix, Arizona. Police said Bekken at North Idaho College advertised on Craigslist for several semesters and agreed to meet a female student at a Coeur d'Alene apartment complex on February 2nd. According to police documents through the Coeur d' Alene Police Department, officers were notified by the FBI of ads targeting NIC students. FBI Agents and Spokane Detectives working internet crimes responded to ads that said 'Hello, I have a proposition for NIC students.' The message detectives received was 'I have some grant money that I can get applied to your account. I just look for some fun in return.' With the approval of NIC President Joe Dunlap Coeur d' Alene, officers created a fake student account and responded to the NIC ads again. The response officers got back was the same as before, 'I have some extra grant money to allocate. Just looking for some potential fun on the side.' Officers asked what they would have to do and were told, 'I'm completely open. Sex, oral, etc...watching.' The next day he received a reply stating, 'i have some extra grant money to allocate. looking for individuals who can and want to receive it. just looking for some potential fun on the side.' The email conversation continued over the next 10 days and included an exchange of photos, with an male undercover police detective using female images he found online with no visible faces. At one point the officer, writing as 'Sheryl Roberts,' wrote about being uncomfortable with the situation. The response, allegedly from Bekken, was, 'Well, I'm really antsy honestly. I've never done anything like this and I hope it doesn't come back to bite me. Anyhow, I hope you are discreet and I will be to (sic). If this works, we can keep it going for future semesters.' A few days later the detective received emails about the scholarship money and how to access it. They arranged to meet 11am February 2 at what the undercover officer said was 'her' residence, an apartment on Julia Street behind a Lowe's store. Undercover: Police say Bekken advertised on Craigslist for several semesters and agreed to meet a female student at a Coeur d'Alene apartment complex on Feb. 2, but it turned out to be an undercover sting . When Bekken knocked on the door, the detective and an FBI agent approached him and took him to the police station for an interview. Police say Bekken agreed to be interviewed by police on February 2nd and said he'd also been using Craigslist in Arizona to set up sexual encounters. Bekken said he used Craigslist to find others, mostly men, for casual sexual encounters when he worked at Grand Canyon University in Phoenix, Arizona. Bekken said a few semesters ago he got the idea to offer scholarship money for sex and posted his offer to NIC students in the 'casual encounters' section of Craigslist, according to a police report. He said, police reported, that when he moved to Idaho he got the idea to trade scholarship money for sex. Bekken ultimately deposited a total of $587 in grants into the student account before being detained at a meet-up arranged by police. The college fired Bekken later that day, and Coeur d'Alene police arrested him Wednesday, when he was booked into the Kootenai County Jail. Bekken told police he hadn't successfully arranged any such encounters. Bekken is married and has four children. In Boise, state officials expressed shock over the allegations but said they're confident NIC and police are responding appropriately. 'This is just very much an anomaly and I just don't know what to say,' said Don Soltman, who represents North Idaho on the state Board of Education, which oversees all public higher education institutions in Idaho. Blake Youde, spokesman for the state board, said financial aid personnel at Idaho's colleges and universities are professionals who take their jobs seriously. 'I am confident that this is not a standard situation,' Youde said. Bekken previously worked as a financial aid counselor at Grand Canyon University and at the University of Phoenix. Whitaker, the prosecutor, in statements made in court on Thursday left it unclear why Bakken left Grand Canyon University in Phoenix. Judge Wayman denied Bekken's request for a public defender, noting the job he had at North Idaho College had paid him about $74,000 a year. It wasn't clear on Friday if Bekken had hired a private attorney.","Joseph M. Bekken, a former North Idaho College Financial Aid Director, is being held on a $100,000 bond .

"Henry's third wife: Kate Phillips as Jane Seymour in Wolf Hall . Viewers of the BBC's flagship historical drama Wolf Hall have reacted with shock after the 'C-word' was used on the latest episode of the programme. Fans of the Tudor-themed series questioned whether the use of the word, usually considered the rudest swear word in English, was 'really necessary'. And 24 members of the public have filed official complaints  objecting to the use of the word in the programme, which is aired on BBC2 just after the 9pm watershed. Wolf Hall, which is based on the best-selling novel by Hilary Mantel and chronicles the rise of Henry VIII's adviser Thomas Cromwell, regularly uses bad language in an apparent bid for historical accuracy. But the episode broadcast last Wednesday was the first to feature the C-word, during a discussion between courtiers about Henry's third wife Jane Seymour. As the king, played by Damian Lewis, looked out of the window at his future bride, he mused: 'Does not Mistress Seymour have the tiniest hands?' While he walked away, courtiers mocked him behind his back, with one saying: 'Does she not have the whitest throat?' At that point, one nobleman joked: ‘Has she not got the wettest c*** you ever groped?’ Scroll down for video . Shock: This scene in Wolf Hall featured the use of the C-word, considered the most offensive in English . Complaint: Some viewers took to Twitter to express their outrage at the use of the obscenity . Some viewers took to the internet to express their surprise at the obscenity - which followed a warning about 'very strong language'. Suzie Warren wrote on Twitter: 'Was the ""very strong language"" really necessary? #rude'. A spokesman for Ofcom revealed that the regulator has received four complaints about the swearing in the episode, adding: 'We will assess these complaints before deciding whether to investigate or not.' In addition, 20 viewers complained to the BBC directly. The moment was also featured on Gogglebox last week, provoking visible shock from the TV viewers who star in the Channel 4 reality show. Hit: The drama, starring Damian Lewis as Henry VIII and Mark Rylance as Thomas Cromwell, is on BBC2 . A spokesman for the BBC said: 'Wolf Hall is broadcast after the watershed and the language in this powerful scene was taken from Hilary Mantel’s original text.' Wolf Hall has attracted acclaim from critics and viewers for its lavish production values and Mark Rylance's starring performance as Cromwell. Author: Wolf Hall novelist Hilary Mantel has frequently courted controversy in the past . However, it has also been the subject of controversy over its decision to use only candles to light the set, and accusations that some details are historically inaccurate. The novel by Ms Mantel won the 2009 Booker Prize, while its sequel Bring Up the Bodies was given the same award three years later. But despite the author's success, she has courted high-profile rows after describing the Duchess of Cambridge as a 'shop window mannequin' and writing a short story fantasising about Margaret Thatcher being assassinated. The book of Wolf Hall also uses the C-word, which has been part of the English language since at least the 13th century. In its earliest centuries the word was not considered particularly obscene, and it appears multiple times in the works of Geoffrey Chaucer. But by the time of Shakespeare, shortly after the era in which Wolf Hall is set, the term appears to have become a taboo, and though the playwright alludes to it he never uses it outright. A BBC poll from 2000 found that people considered it the most offensive word of all, even ahead of vile racial slurs.","Tudor-themed drama broadcast the word 'c***' during last week's episode .

"A horse rider who had her leg sliced off in a horrific motorbike crash is hoping to win a place in the Paralympics after learning to walk again with the help of a prosthetic limb made by her grandfather. Kerry Waters, 30, was lucky to survive after being thrown from her motorcycle when she crashed into a ditch in October last year after being blinded by sunlight. However, as she was flung from the motorbike, she collided with a telegraph pole and the supporting wire sliced her right leg off from just above the knee. The horse enthusiast, from Ashingdon, Essex, was left distraught that she may never be able to walk or ride again, but has now surprised doctors by getting back on her feet after just four months. Horse enthusiast Kerry Waters, 30, lost her right leg in a horrific motorcycle crash in October last year. Despite her leg being amputated, Ms Waters is now back on her horse and hopes to enter the Paralympics . The biker (pictured left before the accident) was thrown from her motorcycle after crashing into a ditch. Her right leg was sliced off after she collided with a telegraph pole and she is now learning how to walk again . The dental nurse, who has been riding horses since the age of two, now hopes to represent the UK at the Paralympics after her grandfather Dennis made her a prosthetic wooden leg. She said: 'When I was lying in hospital I never thought I'd be back riding ever again, I thought it was all over for me. 'I was a very sporty person and I've had to learn to adjust my life around my leg, I think my passion to get back on the horse has helped my recovery. 'I've always loved horses and needed to start riding again, but the NHS were quite slow making a riding leg me so my granddad started work on his own version. 'It doesn't look very pretty but he painted the toenails pink for me just to give it a more girly feel. 'I'm a real fighter but it was tough learning how to walk with my prosthetic, thankfully my family and friends helped me get through it all. 'I don't think I could have done it without them - I'm eternally grateful. 'Sometimes I think they forget I've got a prosthetic leg when we're out walking and I have to ask them to slow down for me to catch up.' Ms Waters (pictured above before the accident) led an active life and was a keen bike and horse rider . She has now been given hope after her grandfather Dennis made her a prosthetic wooden leg to help her get back on her feet. He even went to the effort of painting the toenails on the false limb with pink nail varnish . Ms Waters (pictured with friends after a fundraising run) now leaves a fairly active life and goes to the gym . Ms Waters said she feared she would never walk or ride again after being thrown off her motorcyle in the crash last October. She recalls: 'I remember looking down at the speedometer, I was doing 40mph and looked up to be blinded by the sun. 'Then the handlebars started shaking, I barely had time to think other than to realise the danger I was in and hit the ditch. 'I can't remember hitting the telegraph pole or the supporting wire that took my leg clean off. 'I woke up with my hands by my side facing down without my helmet. I started to panic and tried to stand up to see where it was. 'A lady came over to help me while I sat up, it was then that I realised I didn't have a leg. 'I kept shouting at her, asking where my leg was over and over. 'It was all very surreal, it's weird but there wasn't any pain at all.' Before falling unconscious she managed to give her phone to the woman who came to her aid and asked her to call her family. She was then airlifted by Essex Air Ambulance to St George's Hospital in London and rushed straight into surgery, where doctors decided to amputate to the knee because her wound so full of dirt and gravel. Ms Waters was a keen biker before the crash in October last year in which she was thrown from her vehicle . Her leg was virtually sliced off in the crash but had to be further amputated above the knee due to the injury . Ms Waters has undergone four months of rehabilitation but is now able to walk with the help of prosthetics . Ms Waters also suffered a fractured femur and severe grazing across her body in the crash, leaving doctors no other option than to induce a coma with breathing apparatus to keep her alive. She said: 'I remember waking up to my sister stroking my forehead and mum holding my hand, I was in a state of shock. 'I couldn't talk because there were tubes in my throat, all I could do was look at my missing leg. 'My mum couldn't keep eye contact with me and I panicked so much that I had to be sedated. 'All I kept thinking was how my life would change and how active I used to be, I really struggled to comprehend what happened.' However, after months of rehabilitation she can now walk and ride again and uses the prosthetic limb to help her move forward with her life. She said: 'My life has been completely changed, it's a struggle to put on my prosthetic leg but I still lead a very active life, I got to the gym several times a week and enter the Paralympics. 'I'm not as active as I used to be but I'm still able to do a lot. Ms Waters said she is eternally grateful to her family for their support and help, particularly her grandfather Dennis (together left after the accident), who created her a wooden prosthetic leg to help get her riding again . The dental nurse has joined Riders for the Disabled Association in the hope of breaking through into the Paralympic team. She hopes she will be able to represent the UK at the Games with the help of her false leg . 'At first I blocked the accident out - I don't think I'll ever be able to accept what happened - but I'm learning to live with it and at least I can still walk. 'I've overcame a lot to get where I am now, I keep setting the bar high and pushing myself more and more.' Ms Waters has even joined her local Riders for the Disabled Association in the hope of breaking through into the Paralympic team. She added: 'It's everyone's dream to represent their country doing something they love. 'I'm entering a lot of competitions and hope to be picked for the team.

"An al-Qaeda linked terror group has issued a chilling propaganda video threatening Western shopping centres and singling out 'Jewish owned' Westfield malls as targets. In a 76-minute long message issued overnight, a masked militant purportedly from the al-Shabaab organisation encouraged Islamic fundamentalists to strike at shopping centres around the world. Dressed in military fatigues, the spokesman named complexes owned by Frank Lowy's Australian group as among potential targets, dwelling on two Westfield malls in East and West London. 'If just a handful of mujahideen fighters could bring Kenya to a complete stand-still for nearly a week, just imagine what the dedicated mujahideen could do in the West to American or Jewish shopping centres across the world,' he said. Scroll down for video .

Return fire: Shortly after the Westgate Mall incident in September 2013, Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack. More than 60 people died, while around 200 people were injured.

Or any of the hundred or so of the Jewish owned Westfield shopping centres. ‘Take the Westfield shopping centre in (London's) Stratford or White City for example, what would be the implications of such an attack, one can only imagine. ‘All it takes is a man with firm determination, of which our Muslim ummah (community) has plenty of. ‘So hurry up and hasten to Heaven and do not hesitate.'

Westfield was co-founded by Sydney resident Mr Lowy and operates scores of complexes in Australia, the United States and United Kingdom. Daily Mail Australia has approached Westfield for comment about whether any precautions are being taken in Australian centres. Shortly following the bloody September 2013 attack, al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the Westgate siege which left 67 people dead and hundreds injured. In the newly-released video, al-Shabaab runs a documentary-style account of the deadly attack, complete with images of terrified men, women and children running for their lives through the mall. The footage, posted online by the terror group, includes images of terrorist activity and discusses Kenya's military intervention in Somalia. The masked militant then appears on-screen and suggests a range of attacks on the Western targets. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson has warned visitors to the Mall of America to remain vigilant.

"A former ballerina allows mothers to bring their babies to her pole-dancing class - and says it's cheaper than getting a babysitter. Anna Milosevic, 34, from London, founded Pole Fit after she had her daughter Faye last summer and realised there was nowhere she could go to get her pre-baby body back, and bring her child with her. The pole-dancing instructor's solution  was to create a class where new mums can work out on poles while their infants sit on cushions on the floor and watch - but she insists it's a clean-cut, family-friendly environment. A former ballerina holds pole fitness classes for new mums and allows them to bring their babies to watch . She has even added a soft play area so toddlers and older babies can  enjoy themselves as their mothers tackle the core-strengthening routines. The 34-year-old, who is married to husband Vedran, 35, said she 'wanted to tone up' after the birth of her baby. Anna said she soon became aware of other mums who wanted to get fit post-birth but struggled with managing childcare. 'I knew other new mums who wanted to lose their baby weight too. Anna Milosevic wanted to get fit after giving birth to her daughter Faye and having trained as a pole fitness instructor new the benefits of pole dancing.

'I don't teach the mums anything that you would see in a strip club and don't let the kids have a go because of the connotations. It's harmless.' Children as young as a few months old watch their mothers twirling on the pole and she said the baby girls who attended the class liked it, while the boys were less interested. Anna has designed her classes to fit around new mums, allowing them to bring children up to two into her lessons as she says that it is cheaper than childcare. Pictured: Some mums at a class . Anna's range of exercises are designed to help new mothers build up and strengthen their core muscles and improve their posture. Pictured: Anna teaching during her classes . The babies are never allowed to join in on the classes but Anna says having them watch is harmless . 'They don't care what's going on,' she said. 'It means their mums would get to exercise without having to find someone to babysit for them.' Anna's range of exercises are designed to help new mothers build up and strengthen their core muscles and improve their posture. The mother-of-one says that her classes are designed to go hand-in-hand with being a new mum and wanting to shape up. 'Most mums already have upper body strength from picking up their babies. 'I spoke to my midwife to find out how soon new mums could exercise safely and what exercises were suitable. Aside from the poles, the classes are crammed with toys for babies and young children to play . 'I learned that eight weeks is enough time for the body to heal following a pregnancy, including after a woman has had a caesarean section. 'So only mums whose babies are eight weeks and older, and are fit enough to take part, are allowed to join. 'Some of the classes I run are shorter as newborns can get restless.' Anna now holds classes for mothers with babies up to eight months old, then up to 18 months. The classes are tailored so that mothers can tend to their babies at any point . Aside from the poles, the classes are crammed with toys for babies and young children to play with as well as soft mats and pillows help to keep the babies propped up and comfortable during the sessions. The classes are tailored so that mothers can tend to their babies at any point, to feed them or stop them crying. She added: 'My classes actually work better when there are lots of mums there. 'There are two people to every pole so while one mum is exercising the other can tend to their babies.'","Anna Milosevic opened her pole fitness class wanting to tone up after birth .

"There's nothing more awkward than rocking up to an event in the same outfit as someone else and luckily for the stars at Sunday night's Oscars, they managed to avoid such a mishap. But for Jennifer Lopez and actor and director Robert Duvall's wife, Luciana Pedraza, it was a near miss. Whilst the two stars didn't wear the exact same dress, the styles of their frocks were so similar, they may as well have. Scroll down for video . Jennifer Lopez, let, and actor and director Robert Duvall's wife, Luciana Pedraza, right, looked strikingly similar in pretty peach gowns on the Oscars red carpet on Sunday night . The two red carpet beauties looked pretty in peach wearing strikingly similar gowns on the red carpet last night. Jennifer Lopez, 45, looked the vision of youth in a dazzling Elie Saab Haute Couture gown, which came complete with hand-embellished crystal detailing. Pedraza, 43, meanwhile, looked remarkably similar to Lopez in a Jad Ghandor number. Both gowns were slashed to the midriff, revealing ample cleavage, and came with showstopping tulle skirts. The duo even accessorised in sync, both carrying boxy clutches and wearing diamond drop earrings.

She may oozed glamour but Lopez's voluminous gown presented some technical difficulties of its own. The  star suffered a bit of a train trip after presenting the Best Costume Award to The Grand Budapest Hotel's Milena Canonero with Chris Pine, but fortunately the Star Trek actor saved her from making an even more embarrassing misstep. Jennifer's heels appeared to have gotten caught in the cascading material as the pair walked off the stage at The Dolby Theater in Hollywood, California. Earlier in the evening, the singer-dancer-entrepreneur needed a helping hand from the valets when exiting her limousine. Speaking to Lara Spencer on the red carpet, Jennifer explained she has a tried and tested formula for walking the red carpet. She said: 'I knew it would be a challenge, but I like a challenge.

"Resplendent in a sparkling black top and tailored trousers, Monaco's Princess Charlene looked every inch the yummy mummy as she ramped up the glamour for a cocktail party last week. Joined by husband Prince Albert, 56, the new mother was making the most of a rare night away from her two-month-old twins, Jacques and Gabriella. The event, which was held at the Monte-Carlo Casino, was the work of the Princess Charlene of Monaco Foundation and was intended to raise funds for its Learn to Swim programme. Scroll down for video . Chic: Princess Charlene was glamorous in sparkling black at a Monte-Carlo cocktail party last week . Charlene, a former Olympic swimmer, is passionate about water safety and, in 2014 alone, her Foundation taught 40,000 children how to take to the sea in safety. And it seems her concerns are a family affair, with the Princess joined for the event by her brother Gareth as well as her husband. He was at the event with Gavin Varejes, president of South Africa Rugby Legends, which has joined forces with the Princess Charlene Foundation to bring a group of underprivileged South African children to Monaco. The group, who will arrive next month, will take part in the Saint Devote Rugby Tournament next month. In the summer, a group of Monégasque children will travel in the opposite direction and take part in a tournament in the country of Princess Charlene's birth.

Family affair: Charlene, second left, was joined by her brother Gareth, left, and husband Albert, centre right . Gift: Charlene was presented with a print of Nelson Mandela's hands by Gavin Varejes (left) Speaking in a statement released after the event, the Princess Charlene Foundation said the exchange was part of an ongoing programme to promote sport in schools. 'The Sport and Education programme supports the belief that physical education is an important tool that contributes to the well-being of children,' read the statement. 'Sport plays a fundamental role in a child’s developmental process. It allows young people to learn about the importance of key values and life skills such as respect, cooperation, honesty, fair play, interaction, communication, competition, determination and adherence to rules.' Last week's cocktail party is the third time Princess Charlene has appeared in public since the birth of her twin babies in December. Her first appearance came on the 7th January, when, with her husband, she appeared on the balcony of the Palais Princier to present the two tiny babies to their adoring public. At the end of January, Charlene joined her husband Prince Albert for the traditional St Devote service, which marks the death of a 4th Century martyr. During that event, she helped husband Albert to set fire to a fishing boat - a tradition that's been going strong since the reign of Prince Louis II in 1942. Important work: Charlene's Foundation is organising a rugby exchange programme for children . Big announcement: The exchange will bring South African children to Monaco and vice-versa .

"Calling to book a table, make a doctor's appointment or phoning for help when stranded at the side of the road are tasks many people  take for granted. But for the deaf, simple tasks like these typically require expensive equipment or a mediator - until now. The Pedius app was created to help deaf people speak to friends, family and businesses on the phone using voice recognition and real-time speech translation. Scroll down for video . Pedius (pictured)  uses voice recognition and speech translation to make calls more natural. When a call is made using the app the user types a message on the screen. This is translated to speech in real time, so the recipient can 'hear' them. The recipient's spoken response is then immediately translated into text . When a call is made using the free Android or iOS app, the user types a message on the screen. This is translated to speech in real time, so the recipient can hear the request or conversation.Their spoken response is then immediately translated into text. Pedius was developed by Italian entrepreneur Lorenzo Di Ciaccio after he heard a story about a deaf man whose car had broken down. The driver was unable to communicate by phone and was left waiting for hours hoping someone would notice and help him. Last year a visually impaired developer from Denmark  launched an app designed to help blind people 'see'. The free Be My Eyes app connects blind people to a sighted volunteer using a live video chat. The volunteer can then answer questions and see the blind person's surroundings using a phone's camera. Be My Eyes takes advantage of an iPhone feature called VoiceOver. This lets people who are completely blind use the device using synthetic speech and a touch-based interface. Pedius does not require both users to have specific hardware, and all communications and interactions are private. If the voice transcription is not accurate enough, Pedius automatically shows alternatives, and if it's still not enough, a user can ask the recipient to repeat themselves using the 'R' button. Users can additionally record messages using their own voice by pressing the microphone button. Although the app is free, calls cost 15p per minute when made in the UK, Italy and Ireland and users need to add credit to the account to make these calls. A typical top-up starts at £3.99, but credit packages are also available in £5, £10, £20 and £50 bundles. From next month, users will also be given 20 free minutes every month. Pedius launched in Italy in 2013 and is now available in the UK, US and France. The firm plans to expand further into Europe later this year. 'Being able to make a simple phone call is something we often take for granted,' said Mr Di Ciaccio. 'There are over 70 million people in the world who have profound to severe hearing loss and are unable to use phones. If the voice transcription is not accurate enough Pedius automatically shows alternatives, and if it's still not enough, a user can ask the recipient to repeat themselves using the 'R' button. Users can record messages by pressing the microphone button (left) and use contact lists by connecting existing accounts (right) Earlier this year Google released an audio translation function for its Translate app. Transcription experts at Verbalink recently tested the tool's accuracy when compared to human translators. For the first test, Google Translate and a translator called Adriana were asked to translate a promotional document about Argentina’s National Beekeeping Council from Spanish into English. For the second test, both had to translate a minute of Spanish audio into English. For both document and audio translation, Google was able to capture the 'overall gist' of the content and Verbalink said it would be useful for quick, general understanding. Transcription experts at Verbalink recently tested Google Translate's accuracy when compared to human translators (pictured). Google’s translations 'were too raw to be used for any professional purpose, and readability was often compromised by poor word choices and questionable grammar', explained the firm . But Verbalink added that Google’s translations 'were too raw to be used for any professional purpose, and readability was often compromised by poor word choices and questionable grammar'. In the second test, for example, Google failed to translate the word 'ya ya'. Adriana had a higher degree of overall accuracy and a greater ability to capture the tone and style of the original documents. By being able to  consider the subject matter, context, and target audience, Adriana's translations sounded more natural. 'Of course, a human translator won’t fit in your pocket, and they may not always be able to accompany you to that very authentic Thai restaurant or overseas vacation,' explained Verbalink. 'When you need immediate results, and they don’t have to be perfect, it’s OK to use Google Translate. '[But] for any sort of business or commercial documents, or anything that has to be precise, it’s best to stick with human translators.' 'A smartphone is something most people have, so Pedius is designed to help make everyday life easier by offering a more accessible way to communicate whenever they like over the phone.'

"A Mississippi lawmaker has been accused of racism after accusing all of the black people in his town of being on welfare benefits and food stamps. State Representative Gene Alday sparked outrage after making the comments in an interview with local media. The Republican, who was first elected to the House of Representatives in 2011 and was a former mayor of the town of Walls, was asked about improving education and boosting reading levels by electing superintendents in schools. Mississippi representative Gene Alday stands before the house to apologise for comments he made about black people in a local newspaper interview . But he disagreed with the idea telling the Clarion Ledger: 'I come from a town where all the blacks are getting food stamps and what I call 'welfare crazy checks'. They don't work.' He later turned to healthcare provision in his hometown in Desoto County by recalling a trip to the emergency room, saying: 'I like died. 'I laid in there for hours because they (black people) were in there being treated for gunshots.' Fellow Republicans were quick to distance themselves from Mr Alday's comments and House Representatives also called for his resignation. They held a press conference saying they were concerned by his use of language and are calling for discussions with top elected officials to discuss the issue. Mr Alday had said that all of the blacks from his hometown of Walls were all on welfare benefits and were receiving food stamps . This prompted Mr Alday to say his comments were taken out of context and that he isn't a 'bad person' when he addressed the chamber on Tuesday. He also denied being racist, saying he was a supporter of civil rights. He added: 'Yes, it's true that most of the blacks in my hometown are on welfare. But they're good people. I don't have anything against anybody. 'I'm a straight-up guy. In my little town they had little civil rights walks and I was with them. I'm with everybody.' His apology was greeted with applause by the house and he says he will stand for re-election despite the calls for him to step down.","Republican Gene Alday asked about education in interview with media .

"Sean Penn is in hot water over remarks he made about a ‘green card’ into relation to Mexican-born Oscar-winner Alejandro Inarritu who won Sunday night’s Oscar for best director. Penn arrived on stage at the end of the Sunday's Academy Awards telecast to hand out the award for best film. In announcing the win for Birdman, Penn asked, 'Who gave this son of a bitch his green card? Birdman.' Sean Penn is in hot water over remarks he made about a ‘green card’ into relation to Mexican-born Oscar-winner Alejandro Inarritu who won Sunday night’s Oscar for best director . One of the first to call Penn out was filmmaker and immigration activist Jose Antonio Vargas . Twitter quickly went into meltdown with users denouncing Penn’s ill-judged ‘joke’ as 'insensitive' to the plight of many immigrants in the United States and 'racist.' One of the first to call Penn out was filmmaker and immigration activist Jose Antonio Vargas. 'Mexican director = green card joke. Not funny, just plain xenophobic. Wtf, Sean Penn?!' he tweeted. Others, including TV presenter Mario Lopez, pointed out that the comment was made about a Mexican while no one questioned the immigration status of the countless British and Australian actors in attendance. The term 'green card' refers to a document that confers permanent residency to immigrants in the United States. While the remark about Inarritu's immigration status struck many as an insult, the director insisted it was nothing more than a brutal joke between old friends. 'I found it hilarious,' Inarritu said after the ceremony. 'Sean and I have that kind of brutal (relationship) where only true friendship can survive.' Penn's ill-judged attempt at humor was considered racial insensitive by a number of people on Twitter . Other people commented that no one would make such a racial-charged 'joke' about the countless Brits and Australians present at the event . Inarritu directed Penn in his 2003 film 21 Grams, and the pair remain friends. Penn posed for pictures with Inarritu after the ceremony. The director, who won three Oscars on Sunday night, said he has told many similarly brutal jokes at Penn's expense. 'I make on him a lot of very tough jokes that I will not tell you,' Inarritu said. Joke or not, the remark struck many online as problematic for an awards ceremony that had been criticized for not having more nominees of color. Inarritu joked that after his three wins on Sunday night, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences might institute a residency requirement. His win in the best directing category marks back-to-back wins for Mexican-born directors; last year Alfonso Cuaron won that honor for Gravity. TV presenter Mario Lopez was quick to point out that the comment was made about a Mexican while no one questioned the immigration status of the countless British and Australian actors in attendance . Director Alejandro Inarritu, seated, insisted afterwards that Penn's remark was nothing more than a brutal joke between old friends . 'Maybe next year, the government will inflict some immigration rules (on) the academy. Two Mexicans in a row, that's suspicious, I guess.' It took some of the sting out of Penn's words, but Inarritu also used the opportunity of having some of the last words in the Oscar telecast to celebrate immigrants. The director called on his fellow Mexicans to build a better government, and said those who have come to the United States should be afforded the respect that previous generations of immigrants have been given. 'I want to dedicate this award for my fellow Mexicans, the ones who live in Mexico,' Inarritu said. 'I pray that we can find and build the government that we deserve. And the ones that live in this country who are part of the latest generation of immigrants in this country, I just pray that they can be treated with the same dignity and the respect of the ones who came before and (built) this incredible immigrant nation.'","Sean Penn joked about a 'green card' before awarding the best film Oscar to Mexican-born director Alejandro Inarritu on Sunday night .

"A New York writer has discovered that his stolen iPhone ended up in China - after photos of a stranger posing beside an orange tree started appearing on his iCloud. Matt Stopera explained in an article on Buzzfeed how, a year after his phone was pinched from a Manhattan bar, he was scrolling through his pictures and started seeing images of the man and set off to investigate how the images had ended up there. In a bizarre twist, the story has brought him fame across China, where internet users tracked down the man, dubbed Brother Orange - and Stopera now hopes to visit the country to meet him. Stopera first noticed hundreds of unfamiliar photos on his phone a few weeks ago. Scroll down for video . Bizarre: Buzzfeed writer Matt Stopera, pictured, said he was stunned when he learned his stolen iPhone had ended up in China - and that he was able to see photos a man there was snapping of himself . 'I was going through my photos and I was like, ""Oh my God, who is this person?""' he told CBS. The photos included selfies of a man in front of orange trees, as well as images of fireworks, stores and menus - and Stopera guessed they had been taken from somewhere in Asia. More images started appearing: people on motorbikes, children pointing at chickens and stock photos of models, plants and cars. When he mentioned the bizarre happenings to a friend, they told Stopera that most stolen iPhones end up in China - and told him to go to an Apple store immediately. 'The next day, I went to the Apple Store and tried to explain to them that pictures from some guy in China were showing up on my phone,' he explained in his Buzzfeed article. Strange: He first noticed the photos earlier this month - a year after the phone was snatched in Manhattan . Odd: Images of Chinese store fronts and firework displays began appearing on his phone's photo stream . 'They were confused. I got sent around the store until some guy made me log into my iCloud account. Sure enough, there was my old iPhone on network. 'That was it. There it was. My stolen iPhone had gone from the East Village to China. Incredible.' He deleted everything from his old phone and was told that he should no longer have any trouble, although the phone would also stop working for Brother Orange. 'The reason his pictures were showing up on my current phone was because he must have been logged into my iCloud account,' he said. But letting go wasn't easy. 'To be honest, I was kind of upset about the whole thing,' Stopera wrote. 'I kind of liked getting his picture updates and as long as he couldn't access my info, I was OK with it.' Luckily, that was only just the beginning of their relationship. New-found fame: After sharing his story online, it was picked up in China. He joined Chinese social networking site, Weibo (pictured), and discovered that he had hundreds of messages of support from people . Found! After the story was shared, people managed to track down the man in the photographs . After sharing his story online, it was found by readers in China and shared on their version of Twitter, named Weibo. People started calling the anonymous man 'Brother Orange' because of the selfies beside the orange tree. Stopera learned of his new-found internet fame in China when users contacted him to say the story had been viewed thousands of times across Weibo. Chinese internet users found out that the photos had been snapped in Guangdong and got to work finding out the real identity of Brother Orange. Stopera soon received a photo of his old iPhone. 'Apparently Orange Man’s nephew heard about the story and posted pictures of my phone and pictures of his uncle on Weibo,' Stopera wrote in a follow-up article. A Chinese blogger connected the two and said that Brother Orange wanted to invite Stopera to his home and 'prepare the famous local food for you'. Life-changing: After contacting the man - known as Brother Orange because of his poses beside the orange tree in the photo feed - Stopera was invited to China and said he now hopes to visit the country . Stopera shared this image of him saying hello to his new friend in China and is now planning his trip . 'Matt, you are welcome to come to my house to taste downight Meizhou Hakka vegetables,' Brother Orange wrote on Weibo in a message that has since been translated. Stopera said he is now planning a trip to China. 'I think it's actually going to happen,' he told CNN, adding that he has been overwhelmed by the kind messages he has received from so many Chinese internet users.

"A sculpture exhibition showcasing the best of Victorian craftsmanship will soon be unveiled at Tate Britain. Among the collection is a 7ft ceramic elephant and range of jewellery from Chatsworth House as well as bronze and marble sculptures. The exhibition, titled Sculpture Victorious, will be shown at Tate Britain from February 25 for three months. Among pieces included in Sculpture Victorious is a 7ft ceramic elephant by Thomas Longmore and John Henk dating back to 1889. The exhibition is being shown at Tate Britain until the end of May . Intricate metalwork and jewellery is also featured in the collection. Above, The Eglington Trophy, created in 1843 by Edumund Cotterill and R&S Garrard .

Among its sculptures is the well-known Athlete Wrestling with a Python by Frederic Leighton and Hiram Powers' Greek Slave. A Royal Game, a bronze statue by Sir William Reynolds-Stephens depicting Queen Elizabeth I and Philip of Spain is also part of the collection. Perhaps the most noticeable piece is Thomas Longmore and John Henk's 1889 Elephant, a towering 7ft tall. The Victorian era brought about a flurry of productivity among British sculptors with artists able to access a wider range of materials. The sculpture imagines the political and religious struggle between Elizabeth I and Philip of Spain, with the latter's chess pieces the ships of the Armada and the British queen's the fleet that destroyed them . The bronze chess pieces which represent each country's ships are faced toward one another in the sculpture . Dame Alice Owen, 1897,  by George Frampton (left) and Eagle Slayer, 1851, by John Bell (right) are among the statues in the collection . Constant building and development created more places for their works to be displayed while monuments erected across the country inspired more art. Queen Victoria was reportedly a great fan of the art form which had already seen wide success across Europe. It was under her reign that pieces were commissioned for the first time to decorate the Houses of Parliament. In addition to a surge in the number of large sculptures and statues, artists began to consult manufacturers about their production of intricate materials. This brought about an increase in detailed jewellery and smaller ornaments, both of which are showcased in the Tate Britain collection.

"Lisa-Jayne Samuels has been jailed for perverting the course of justice after she accused a man she barely knew of raping her - putting him through a year of hell . A mother-of-four has been jailed after she put a man through a year of hell by making up claims he had raped her. Lisa-Jayne Samuels, 29, invented the allegation because she wanted her mother to feel sorry for her, a court heard. She even had police draw up an e-fit to back up the bogus claims and picked a man, Terry Brown, out in an ID parade. Her allegation hung over Mr Brown for more than a year before she finally admitted she had made up her claim that he spiked her drink and attacked her. During that time he was attacked by a gang and his pregnant partner lost her baby, the court heard. Samuels' own lawyer described her actions as 'loathsome' when she was sentenced at Basildon Crown Court, Essex. She pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice and was jailed for 20 months. Samuels, of Southend, Essex, called 999 at 1am on October 10, 2012, claiming to have been raped at the town's cliffs. When interviewed, she gave a detailed description of her attacker, claiming she had been drinking with friends at the Last Post in Southend, where she met a man she knew from a night shelter who spiked her drink and attacked her. An e-fit was drawn up and Mr Brown, of Basildon, Essex, was arrested the following year. But he was later released without charge after police uncovered inconsistencies in Samuels's story. CCTV from the Last Post and a nearby off-licence showed no sign of Samuels at the time she claimed to be there, and the friends she claimed she was with on the evening were found not to exist. During a voluntary interview with Samuels on December 6, 2013, she eventually admitted to making up the whole story. She said she had lied to try and reconcile with her mother. It is understood she had seen Mr Brown, who hardly knew her, on the night she claimed she had been attacked and based the details of her fictitious attacker on him. Samuels has a history of making such claims. In 2002, she made false claims to police, but later admitted it was so her mother would not find out she had slept with a Kosovan man. In the same year, she phoned police saying she had been raped in a public toilet and also made a hoax fire call to 999. The court heard Samuels, who had made false claims in the past, invented the allegation because she wanted her mother to feel sorry for her . Sentencing Samuels, Recorder Anthony Abell said: 'Rape is one of the most serious and repulsive crimes there is. 'A false allegation of rape can have dreadful consequences on the innocent person who has committed no crime whatsoever. 'It seems your initial call to the police was an impulsive act but you persisted in it, you made an e-fit and identified your supposed attacker in a line up - that was not impulsive. I have a duty to the public, meaning your sentence must be immediate and must be of some length. ' Samuels  has struggled with addiction to alcohol and problems with drugs, including crack cocaine. Her defence solicitor, Paul Vickers, tried to argue her sentence should be suspended, but he was unsuccessful. He said: 'She accepts what she has done was loathsome and describes her actions as stupid. 'You are dealing with a lady who was homeless, intoxicated and in the grip of an addiction, who botched a scheme to enable her to get the support of her mother, to try to get her to feel sorry for her and to take her back and to rebuild her relationship with her. ' Samuels claimed she been attacked after drinking in the Last Post pub in Southend, but it later emerged she was not there at the time she claimed she had been .","Mother-of-four claimed she had been raped after drinking in Southend pub .

"A serving British soldier who went to fight ISIS was being flown home last night after he was found near the border between Syria and Iraq. The 19-year-old private serving with the 2nd Battalion of The Princess of Wales’s Royal Regiment left for the region last week after telling his parents he wanted to help the Kurdish Peshmerga. He was the first British soldier to have gone to fight against the terror group and his disappearance fuelled fears that he could have been a prime beheading target for Islamist jihadists. The 19-year-old soldier who reportedly left  to fight against ISIS is now returning to his unit, it emerged today . The soldier, who is now said to be ‘safe and well’, was in Dubai on leave from his base in Cyprus when he decided to travel to the war-torn country. He was due back at his base yesterday when it emerged the Ministry of Defence had located him and were flying him back. The MoD refused to confirm whether they had found him or whether he had reached out, but last week a defence source said they would not send police to the Middle East looking for him. Speaking during Commons defence questions, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said: ‘The House may also want to know the soldier reported as missing last week has now been located and is being returned to his unit.’ As the soldier was not considered AWOL, it is not clear whether he will face disciplinary action. A defence source said: ‘We are just grateful to have him back at the moment.’ The private is understood to be serving with the 2nd Battalion of The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment . Pictured: Peshmerga fighters outside Mosil, Iraq. A number of foreign fighters have come from around the world to join Kurdish forces in the battle against ISIS . The soldier, who has not been named for security reasons, left his base after sending a message to his family saying: 'I'm with other British people and a Canadian at the moment. I don't know how to explain it to you but I really want and need to do this and I will be safe. He added: 'I have good skills and I can speak the language, I can help these people and help with this fight. I will get in trouble for being AWOL, but it's minor and no prison sentence.' The private joined up at the age of 16 after leaving school and had reportedly been learning Arabic. He was said to have once shared a barracks with murdered Fusilier Lee Rigby. He is understood to have visited the area with the military for a training exercise before he decided to return to fight. He is thought to have been fighting alongside a group called Lions Of Rojava, who have Americans, Canadians and other Britons among their number. The serviceman, who has not been named for security reasons, was stationed in Cyprus and is believed to have travelled to the region via Dubai while on annual leave. He is thought to have then entered Iraq . The soldier reportedly posted a picture online over the weekend showing him standing next to Canadian ex-serviceman Brandon Glossop. In the post, he referred to Glossop as his 'wingman' and, in a message to his family, added: 'I'm all safe guys.' The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment are based at the Tower of London, where the soldier will return to find out whether he faces a court martial. In December it emerged that two former British soldiers had travelled to Syria to fight against ISIS after feeling 'compelled' to take up arms following the murder of aid volunteer Alan Henning. News of the soldier came as the Defence Secretary was urged to clarify exactly what Britain's plan is for the campaign against ISIS in Iraq. Labour MP John Woodcock said it was troubling defence chiefs had failed to outline the objectives for the campaign against ISIS, also known as Isil, in recent evidence to a Commons committee. Speaking at Commons defence questions, the Barrow and Furness MP Mr Woodcock said: 'Do you think it is acceptable none of the service chiefs who gave evidence to the defence committee's recent inquiry was willing or able to articulate the UK's objective or strategic plan in Iraq? What is our plan exactly?' Mr Fallon replied: 'Our plan in Iraq is very simple - it is to disrupt threats to the UK mainland and our interests overseas, secondly it is as part of an international coalition to defeat Isil, including discrediting its violent ideology. 'It is thirdly to mitigate the impact of Isil and other violent extremist groups on the stability of the region as a whole.' It is understood the British soldier joined a group called the Lions Of Rojava, who boast, 'It is better to live one day as a Lion that a thousand days as a sheep.' They are the foreign fighters who have travelled to Syria to fight, not for jihad, but on behalf of the Kurdish communities who are defending their communities from the advance of Sunni Islamists. Just as hundreds of young Europeans have gone to fight for the radical Islamists of Islamic State, so increasing numbers are now travelling to fight for their avowed enemies, the Kurds. Westerners in Kurdistan: A photo of Western fighters from the Lions Of Rojava Facebook page . Jordan Matson, a former U.S. soldier now with Syrian Kurds' People's Protection Units (YPG), operates The Lions Of Rojava Facebook page openly calling for volunteers to travel to join the fight. Just as many of the Islamic State's foreign volunteers have been drawn from the ranks of Sunni Muslim youth worldwide, many of the initial YPG volunteers have come from the Kurdish diaspora. Last August a hairdresser from South London was reported to be the first Briton to travel to fight alongside Kurdish forces. Ethnic Kurd Mama Kurda from Croydon, 26, travelled to Iraq to join the Kurdish peshmerga as they desperately tried to halt Islamic State's lightning advance. But since then many others have been inspired to take up arms against Islamic State, perhaps also inspired by the radical socialist experiment underway in the Kurdish autonomous region of Rojava. Brothers in arms: Briton Jamie Read, right, with American Jordan Matson, who is also fighting in Syria . Inspired by the social ecologist and anarchist Murray Bookchin it has adopted a vision of 'libertarian municipalism' calling for Kurds to create free, self-governing communities. Last October it was reported that a currently serving British Royal Marine had been questioned by police on suspicion he was travelling to fight with Kurdish militias during his leave. The 22-year-old Commando was quizzed after he prepared to fly from California on a one-way ticket to Turkey. He was suspected of being in contact with Kurdish militant groups. Two women, Canadian Jew Gill Rosenberg, 31, and Danish Kurd Joanna Palani, 20, have also reportedly travelled to fight with the Kurds, inspired perhaps by the images of female fighters on the front line against Islamic State terrorists. It is perhaps the only place in the world where women are fighting on the front line of armed conflict. There are also claims that a number of European biker gangs have travelled to Syria and are helping to assist the resistance. Leaders of the Cologne-based Median Empire Motorcycle Club, which has strong Kurdish links, have posted images of their German riders posing in the city - some of them carrying weapons. The news came just days after three members of a notorious motorcycle gang from the Netherlands were told they had not committed any crime by travelling to Kobani to join the fight against ISIS.","Private with Princess of Wales's regiment went to fight while on leave .

"If you don't know what a word means, it's best to just not say it. One Cleveland, Ohio news anchor learned that lesson the hard way when she 'accidentally' uttered a racial slur on-air Monday morning, during a chat about last night's Oscars.

'It's hard to really hear her voice with all the jigaboo music whatever you want to call it...jigaboo,' Capel said in a misguided attempt to compliment the pop star. From the shocked look on African-American Dawson's face, he understands the term but doesn't draw attention to the gaffe as they turn the segment over to their traffic reporter.

"The average British holiday in 2015 will be a couple's sunshine break to Spain, taken out of season, in a hotel with a healthy spending budget to enjoy once we're there. A survey of over 2,000 UK adults by Monarch Airlines revealed that over half of all breaks booked for 2015 are for trips to sunny Spain – more than three times as many as its closest rival destination, Greece which took second spot with 17 per cent. An astounding two thirds of holidays in 2015 will be taken by couples, well ahead of the 21 per cent of bookings made groups of friends, and family holidays with the children, which account for 19 per cent of this year's planned breaks. Spain is set to be the most popular 2015 holiday destination according to research carried out by Monarch . Greece was some way behind Spain in second as the most likely holiday destination for 2015 . Ian Chambers, head of retail and online at Monarch Airlines said: 'This research into 2015's holiday plans show that our customers will be enjoying some seriously relaxing breaks this year. 'Spain's popularity amongst those looking for sun, sea and sangria is as strong as ever, and with Greece being the second most popular destination for 2015 it's no wonder that our new Greek routes are in high demand. 'It's also great to see savvy travellers making the most of the exceptional bargains that are to be had outside of the traditional peak season – June is a month that offers the excellent weather conditions of high summer without the crowds. 1) Spain – 58.3% . 2) Greece – 17.2% . 3) Portugal – 16.1% . 4) Americas – 13.8% . 5) Italy – 12.5% . 6) Turkey – 12.2% . 7) Cyprus – 11.7% . 8) France – 9.1% . 9) Egypt – 6.4% . 10) Croatia – 5.3% . 'However as our research shows, more people are seizing the opportunity and those looking to secure one this year need to act fast to make sure they're not left behind.' The most popular months for travel are outside of the school summer holidays, with almost half of those surveyed (45 per cent) booking a break in September, followed closely by getaways in May (32 per cent) and June (31 per cent). Only one in five of those polled were planning to travel in the traditional peak season of July or August. The appeal of a real break complete with room service and housekeeping is just too strong for most Brits, with over two thirds of holidaymakers booking hotel accommodation over a villa or apartment. The nation's holidaymakers are also keen to ensure they're able to make the most of their hard earned break – the most popular amount of spending money to take on holiday is a sizeable £400-£500 per person, with a lucky 12 per cent taking over £1,000 as holiday spends. Many couples have decided Spain will be the choice for them on holiday in 2015 . The Americas are the fourth top choice destination for Britons this year according to Monarch . Italy sneaks into the top five with 12.5 per cent of Britons opting to visit the Mediterranean country .","Spain set to be almost three times as popular as next-placed Greece .

"Two people have died and 16 have been hospitalized in North Carolina after contracting a superbug which led to the deaths of two patients in Los Angeles. Eighteen people have contracted carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE, in the state so far this year, officials have confirmed. Kevin McCarthy, a spokesman with the Carolinas HealthCare System, told CNN 15 of the patients had CRE upon admission to the unnamed hospital in Charlotte, three acquired it in the hospital. Scroll down for video . Concerning: Health officials give a news conference outside the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center of Los Angeles after seven people contracted a killer superbug. Eighteen people have also been diagnosed with the deadly strain in Charlotte, North Carolina . It comes after two people died at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center last week after routine endoscopic procedures. Seven people, including an eighteen-year-old man, were diagnosed with the superbug and has been linked to surgical tools used on as many as 500,000 patients. Officials warned that as many as 179 people who had endoscopies at the UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center may have been exposed to the so-called superbug. The procedures were done between October 3 and January 28. All five of the confirmed infected patients who remain alive are under treatment, said UCLA spokeswoman Dale Tate. The infections all occurred during procedures in which a specialized scope, known as a duodenoscope, was inserted down the throat to diagnose and treat pancreatic and bile duct diseases. The outbreak has raised questions about whether methods for cleaning the endoscopes were adequate. The 18-year-old man, whose name has not been released, was among those infected by CRE, said attorney Kevin Boyle, a member of his legal team. The man went to the medical center in mid-2014 for a pancreatic ailment and received an endoscopy, Boyle said. The man became ill and was hospitalized a short time later. By November, he had been diagnosed with CRE. The youth spent 83 days in the hospital, mostly in the intensive care unit, the attorney said. 'It's definitely a severe infection,' he said, adding that the infection had landed the young man back in a Los Angeles hospital. The 18-year-old was not in the intensive care unit but was under 24-hour monitoring. 'The (man's) prognosis is unknown,' Boyle said on Saturday. He would not give the name of the hospital where the young man is being treated. Deadly strain: The patients were infected with the carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae bacteria (artists impression). It has been linked to an endoscope used in routine procedures . Further details on the conditions of the five infected patients have not been disclosed, and details on the circumstances of the two deaths have not been made public. Officials have said there is no broader threat to public health, and that hospital officials have called and sent letters to at-risk former patients. All of them are at home, rather than at a hospital, Tate said. No further infections have been reported. Corey Egel, a spokesperson for the California Department of Public Health, said the short-term risk window for additional CRE infections among the patients who came into contact with the scopes was over. There remains, however, a possibility of future infections if the organism was able to colonize inside any of the patients. 'Any person who is colonized with any multi-drug resistant organism is at some increased risk in the future of developing an infection with that organism,' he said. The medical center has said that it had been sterilizing the duodenoscopes implicated in the infection, which it began using in June, according to manufacturer standards. It has said it now uses a more rigorous process that exceeds national standards. The two infected scopes were immediately removed from use for return to the manufacturer, Olympus Medical Systems Group . Olympus did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Hospitals across the United States have reported exposures from the same type of medical equipment in recent years. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said it was working with other government agencies and scope manufacturers to minimize risks to patients. California's public health department said no other hospitals in the state have seen a similar outbreak.","18 people diagnosed with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae .

"Eight British schoolgirls have travelled to Syria in the last seven months using a route which has become known as the 'jihadi bride trail' - and hundreds more besotted British women have proposed marriage to extremists online. The true figure is likely to be even higher as the police and families have imposed news blackouts in some cases, prompting fears that Britain's anti-terrorism agencies are losing the battle against the radicalisation of young Muslims on the internet. School friends Shamima Begum, 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Amira Abase 15, from Bethnal Green Academy are reported to be in Syria after flying out of Gatwick for Turkey earlier this month. A fourth unnamed girl from the same school went out in December. 'Groomed': Shamima Begum (left) is thought to have been contacted directly using Twitter by a female IS fighter. She later flew from Gatwick Airport to Turkey with friends Kadiza Sultana (right) 16, and Amira Abase .

Flight to terror: Clutching their luggage, the three teenage friends prepare to board a flight to Istanbul . Radical websites like Jihad Matchmaker, which offers to arrange marriages between Muslim women and Jihadists, have been blamed for encouraging young, impressionable girls to travel to Syria. Hundreds of besotted British women have put marriage proposals to jihadists fighting on the front line with Islamic State, according to security sources. One European fighter in Syria who has become a pin-up jihadi fighter has been bombarded with proposals from women all over the world, desperate to be associated with a 'holy warrior'. Jihad Matchmaker, which states it is based in Syria, uses the motto ‘keep it halal and get married.’ Its official Twitter account says: ‘Jihad Matchmaker is here to link up those seeking marriage in Syria in a halal manner.' It is not known how many jihadi brides it has matched to jihadi fighters but it has 378 followers, many of whom are young Western Muslim women. Last year it was forced to deny it was linked to any terrorist groups after it was alleged to been responsible for helping to radicalise teenage girls in the UK. It encourages Muslim women seeking a jihadi husband to make contact through a third party or agent who can represent the girl’s interests under Islamic law. It also claims: 'All actions will be conducted via Shariah acceptable routes and means once agreement and compatibilities are established.' Gone: Yusra Hussien was aged 15 when she told her parents she was going on a school trip before leaving her home, heading to Heathrow airport and boarding a flight to Turkey in October last year . Terror twins: Salma and Zahra Halane fled Manchester in June 2014 to join the Islamic State, becoming the first known British jihadi schoolgirls to travel to Syria . The schoolgirls who fled last week followed the same route used by two 16-year-old twins from Manchester, a 15-year-old from Bristol and another 17-year-old girl from south London. All four are believed to have married Islamic State fighters after travelling to Syria via Istanbul from UK airports. Manchester twins Salma and Zahra Halane fled in June 2014 to join the Islamic State and are the first known British jihadi schoolgirls to travel to Syria. But according to reports they are now teenage widows after their jihadi fighter husbands were killed in battles with Kurdish forces or in Coalition bombing raids. In October Yusra Hussien, 15, a GCSE A* student, from Easton, Bristol, left in October with another teenager, Samya Dirie. Both flew to Turkey from Heathrow in October last year before being escorted into Syria. Jihadi bride: Aqsa Mahmood. A lawyer for her family said they are 'full of horror and anger' that she is being allowed by Twitter to 'recruit and encourage' others to travel to Syria . In contact: Shamima Begum, 15, sent an open message (pictured) to Aqsa Mahmood, 20, who had fled to Syria from Glasgow to be a 'jihadi bride' in 2013, asking her to open a private line of communication . Zahra and Salma Halane are also extremely bright and had 28 GCSEs between them. They were planning to become doctors, having just finished their first year of sixth-form college. They too were said to have been radicalised over the internet. Their father Ibrahim and mother Khadra travelled to the region to try to bring them home, but without success. It is estimated that a total of 60 British women are in Syria living with the Islamic State. Yusra Hussien was aged 15 when she told her parents she was going on a school trip before leaving her home, heading to Heathrow airport and boarding a flight to Turkey in October last year. The City Academy pupil and another girl, Samya Dirie, 17, from London, then made their way to territory controlled by violent extremist group Islamic State in Syria.

It was reported earlier this month that Yusra contacted some friends to say she is now married. Friends of Yusra, now 16, have claimed that the Bristol teenager contacted them on social media to confirm she was married in Syria living with the Islamic State. Speaking when she first went missing, Yusra's mother Safiya Hussien, 40, said: 'Please come back. I love you so much, all your brothers and sister, we miss you so much, the house is not the same since when you left.

"A knitter has been awarded a British Empire Medal - after sending 13,000 colourful woolly hats to soldiers serving overseas. Tina Selby, 51, set up the Hats For Heroes campaign because she did not want British troops to get cold on the front line. She had originally planned to send around 500 colourful beanies to servicemen stationed in Afghanistan, after reading how the morale of service personnel can be boosted by receiving treats from home. Trooper: Tina Selby, 51, has been awarded a British Empire Medal - after sending 13,000 colourful woolly hats to soldiers serving overseas . Grateful: Members of 2 Rifles CSS Katt (Logistic Corps) wear their woolly hats with pride as they pose alongside their Mastiff while in Afghanistan . However, after starting her efforts in 2009, Mrs Selby found she could not stop making the hats and ended-up recruiting a small army of knitters to help her. She has also been sent hats from other crafty types who heard about her campaign, and has received cash donations enabling her to buy more wool. As the beanies are only worn when the troops are off duty, Mrs Selby says they do not have to be in any particular colour, but has advised those taking part in the campaign not to use white or fluorescent wool for safety reasons. Winters in Afghanistan can be particularly harsh, with temperatures dropping as low as -20c, making the hats a must have accessory for many servicemen and women. Crafty: Mrs Selby set up the Hats For Heroes campaign because she did not want British troops to get cold on the front line . Ongoing: Mrs Selby couldn't stop making hats and ended-up recruiting a small army of knitters to help her, as well as receiving hats from other crafty types who heard about her efforts . Depending on the style knitted, it takes around one or two balls of wool to make the hats - typically costing between £5 and £10 depending on the type of yarn used. Mrs Selby has now been honoured for her 'innovative' campaign, based out of her home in Penarth near Cardiff, Wales. However, she says her efforts are a 'drop in the ocean' compared to the work done by the soldiers fighting on foreign soil. Cosy: Members of Support Company 1 Yorkshire Regiment model an array of knitted hats, made by Mrs Selby and her army of knitters . Support: Mrs Selby says her efforts are a 'drop in the ocean' compared to the work done by soldiers fighting on foreign soil . She added: 'I was proud and humbled to receive the award. It was nice to have the recognition but I didn't do it for that.' Mrs Selby set up the campaign in 2010 and plans to send out a total of 17,000 hats before she is finished, meaning she has another 4,000 to go. With the withdrawal from Afghanistan now underway as of the end of 2013 there were around 5,200 troops left in Helmand Province - compared to the end of June 2011 when there were roughly 9,500. Mrs Selby says she now has enough hats to cover the final deployment in Afghanistan and has asked her knitters to down tools so the final consignment can be posted out.

"David Cameron today pledges to protect a raft of pensioner benefits to ensure 'dignity and security in retirement'. In a major pitch to grey voters, the Prime Minister will vow to continue paying for the winter fuel allowance, free bus passes, TV licences, prescriptions and eye tests for as long as he is in Downing Street. He will repeat the pledge, which he first made at the last election, as he rejects the argument that such benefits are an 'unnecessary luxury' in times of financial difficulties. Instead, he said it is 'our fundamental duty' to care for those who have 'done the right thing'. They deserve 'comfort, independence, companionship, health' he said in a speech, adding: 'No one has put in as much as our elderly. These people have fought wars, seen us through recessions – made this the great country it is today. 'They brought us into the world and cared for us, and now it's our turn – our fundamental duty – to care for them.' Last year Mr Cameron refused to say whether pensioner benefits would be continued for another five years, amid reports of opposition from within Cabinet. It emerged at the time that senior ministers, including Iain Duncan Smith and George Osborne had both argued for the guarantee to be dropped. Both Labour and the Lib Dems have called for restrictions on elements of some pensioner benefits for the better off. In 2010, during the television debates, Mr Cameron rounded on Gordon Brown, accusing him of scaremongering by telling older people their benefits would be cut under the Tories. Today he said: 'In 2010, I looked down the barrel of the camera and made a clear commitment to the British people that I would keep these things. 'And that wasn't a commitment for five years – it was a commitment for as long as I was Prime Minister. 'I know some people don't like this. There are those who say it's an unnecessary luxury during a time of national financial difficulties. They're wrong. Say that to the older woman who can keep warm tonight, on this cold February evening, because she's been given the money to heat her home. 'Or the widower heading into town on the bus, doing his shopping, seeing people for the only time that week. Or the bedbound lady whose whole day is brightened by the TV; or the sick man whose pain is kept at bay. 'Comfort, independence, companionship, health – these aren't luxuries; they're what people who have worked and saved all their lives deserve. 'And think what we would give up if we did take them away – the principle that if you've done the right thing you will get the benefits of living in Britain.' Rejecting the argument that pensioner benefits need to be reduced to pay for cuts to the overall welfare bill, he will point out that the 'biggest saving' made by the Government has been as a result of raising the retirement age. He will also hint that Labour, which has said it will cut winter fuel payments for richer pensioners, could go further and restrict the benefits 'far more aggressively' or even abolish them altogether. That suggestion will be furiously rejected by Labour. The Winter Fuel Allowance costs around £2billion a year, the free TV licence for over-75s £600million, free bus passes £1billion and free prescriptions and eye tests £4billion. Tory analysis suggests that Labour's policy of means-testing winter fuel payments will save just £75million after administration costs – or just 4 per cent of the budget for the benefit. That compares to Labour's estimate of £105million a year. Enjoying the ride: Joan Dyson, 70, and Marion Pickering, 67, use their right to free travel on a London bus . In this Parliament the Lib Dems have refused to countenance any further welfare reform unless Mr Cameron agrees to cuts to benefits for the better off. It is Lib Dem policy to remove winter fuel payments and TV licences from higher rate tax paying pensioners but continue the pensioner bus pass, free prescriptions or eye tests for all. Lib Dem pensions minister Steve Webb said: 'The working age poor will pay the price for the Conservative ring fence for the very wealthiest pensioners. Lib Dem pensions minister Steve Webb said: 'The working age poor will pay the price for the Conservative ring fence for the very wealthiest pensioners' 'The Conservatives are proposing £12 billion pounds of welfare cuts which is the equivalent of a £1500 cut for eight million people. 'By ruling out any changes to benefits of wealthy pensioners they are showing their determination to balance the books solely on the backs of disabled people and the working age poor.' Mr Cameron pledged last year to keep the 'triple lock', which guarantees the value of the £113-a-week basic state pension, until at least 2020 if he wins the election. Mr Cameron said: 'The truth is this: the big savings will only come by restricting these benefits far more aggressively – or by abolishing these benefits altogether. 'That's why I have to warn people – beware of politicians promising just to cut one or two of these benefits, and only by a bit. Once they have started chipping away at these benefits, believe me, before long, they'll start getting rid of them altogether.' The announcement was welcomed by campaign groups representing older people. Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: 'Age UK supports the continuation of older people's universal benefits because they are the best way we have of getting extra help to those who need it, and because older people tell us they value them highly.' Paul Green of Saga said: 'There appears to be much in today's announcement that will appeal to the Saga generations.' Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary, said: 'David Cameron's government has let millions of pensioners down, failing to act on rising fuel costs and rip off pension fees and charges. 'Pensioners will find it hard to take pre-election promises seriously from a Prime Minister who has introduced the granny tax, increased VAT, and caused the Tory NHS crisis which has damaged social care services. 'Labour has a better plan for pensioners. We will support the triple lock, freeze energy bills and ensure savers are protected against pension rip-off pension charges and mis-selling. As part of our plan to get the deficit down in a fairer way, we will stop paying the winter fuel allowance to the richest five per cent of pensioners and reverse David Cameron's tax cut for millionaires. Accusations that we will end pensioner benefits are simply untrue.'","Prime Minister will today reaffirm pledge he made at the last election .

"More than 11,000 amendments have been proposed in U.S. congressional history, but only 17 have been added to the Constitution. If some of the thousands of amendments had been approved, life as we know it in America would change radically: There would be no president, Americans would declare their allegiance to the United States of Earth, and it would be illegal to get a divorce. As numbers show, though Congress and the states can change the U.S. Constitution through the amendment process, it's very rare. The U.S. Constitution (left) was created in 1787 and went into effect in 1789. The Bill of Rights (right) and its first ten amendments went into effect in 1791. Since then, 17 amendments have been added . One failed proposal, for example, came in 1893 from U.S. Representative Lucas Miller from Wisconsin, who said that America should change its name to 'the United States of Earth', according to Yahoo. 'It is possible for the Republic to grow through the admission of new States into the Union until every Nation on Earth has become part of it,' Miller, who wasn't nominated for a second term, suggested. 1876: A three-person, Roman-style triumvirate should replace role of president . 1876: Eliminate the Senate and Presidency . 1876: Forbid religious leaders from occupying a governmental office or receiving federal funding . 1893: Rename America the 'United States of the Earth' 1893: Abolish the U.S. Army and Navy . 1894: Acknowledge that the Constitution recognizes God and Jesus Christ as supreme leaders in human affairs . 1912: Marriage between races should be illegal . 1921: Divorce should be illegal . 1916: Put all acts of war to a national vote. Any 'yes' voter has to register as a volunteer for service in the U.S. Army . 1933: Limit income to $1million - all excess goes toward lowering national debt . 1936: Allow American people to vote on whether or not country should go to war . 1938: Forbid drunkenness in all states and U.S. territories . 1947: Income tax for individuals should not exceed 25 per cent . 1948: Give the right of citizens to segregate themselves from others . 1971: American citizens should have the alienable right to an environment free of pollution . source: constitutionfacts.com . An amendment, first proposed in the 1880s, that would regulate marriage and divorce was introduced to Congress every year for about 60 years. Former President Theodore Roosevelt, too, lobbed to give Congress power over divorces without passing an amendment. And one 1921 amendment tried to eliminate the idea of divorce entirely. 'Congress shall have power to establish and enforce by appropriate legislation uniform laws as to marriage and divorce: Provided that every state may by law exclude, as to its citizens duly domiciled therein, any or all causes for absolute divorce in such laws mentioned,' the proposal read. In 1876, a citizen named Augustus Wilson proposed to Congress that the role of the president be eliminated and replaced with a three-person, Roman-style triumvirate. That same year, residents of Potter County, Pennsylvania, suggested an amendment that would eliminate the Senate and Presidency. National Archives records show that they were upset because the Senate 'always advanced the interest of the money, railroad and manufacturing speculators to the prejudice of the common welfare'. And in 1933, U.S. Representative Wesley Lloyd, from Washington, proposed that excess income for millionaires making more than $1million per year be put toward lowering the national debt. A 2005 proposal - the Flag Desecration Amendment - came within one vote of passing Senate in 2006 after the House had approved it. The Corwin Amendment, which guaranteed the rights of states that legalized slavery to keep 'persons held to labor or service by the laws of said State', was approved by Congress in 1861, but it was not ratified by the states. To become part of the Constitution, an amendment must be proposed by two-thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives or by two-thirds of the state legislatures in what's called a constitutional convention. For the proposed amendment to then be approved, three-quarters of the state legislatures have to vote to ratify it. Lucas Miller (left) proposed that America change its name to 'the United States of Earth' in 1893 because he believed the nation could take over every nation on Earth. Though Theodore Roosevelt (right) never proposed an amendment to make divorce illegal like many others did, he lobbied to give Congress power over the subject . For an amendment to become part of the constitution, it must be first proposed by two-thirds the Senate and House or two-thirds of state legislatures. It then is up to the states to approve the proposal. Three-quarters of the states must vote to ratify it for the amendment to become valid . U.S. House of Representatives member Thomas Corwin proposed an amendment that guaranteed the rights of states that legalized slavery to keep 'persons held to labor or service by the laws of said State'. It was passed by Congress in 1861 but failed to ratify . A few proposed amendments came close to ratification, including the Titles of Nobility Amendment, the Equal Rights Amendment and the Child Labor Amendment. But since the Bill of Rights, the first ten amendments passed in 1791, 99 per cent of the amendments haven't made it through the congressional approval or constitutional convention, . Of the 17 that have made it through the process, one has already been repealed – the 18th Amendment, which established Prohibition. The 27th Amendment established in 1992, the last to be passed, barred Congress from giving itself a pay raise during the current season. In today's 113th Congress, many proposed amendments focus on balancing the governmental budget and allowing campaign financing. Others include outlawing same-sex marriages nationally, imposing limits on Senate and House terms, repealing the 22nd amendment that limits the presidency term and eliminating the 16th amendment and income taxes.","More than 11,000 amendments have been proposed in Congress .

"Aiming to undercut Apple's latest hit service, Google is teaming up with three major U.S. wireless carriers to prod more people into using its mobile wallet. Google's latest volley calls for its payment service to be built into Android smartphones sold by AT&T Inc., Verizon Wireless and T-Mobile USA later this year. Smartphone owners currently have to download the service, called Google Wallet, and install the app on their phone if they want to use it to buy something instead of pulling out cash or a credit card. Google is teaming up with three major U.S. wireless carriers in an effort to prod more people into using its mobile wallet and undercut the rapid success of Apple's rival payment service. The counterattack announced Monday is just the latest example of how the competition between Google Inc. and Apple Inc. is extending beyond the technology industry's traditional boundaries. Besides payments, Silicon Valley's two richest companies are expanding into fields such as home appliances and cars to increase their power and profits. Apple's rival service, Apple Pay, already comes embedded in the latest versions of the company's mobile software. Besides trying to make it more convenient to use Wallet, Google also is hoping to improve the nearly 4-year-old service. Toward that end, Google Inc. is buying some mobile payment technology and patents from Softcard, a 5-year-old venture owned by the wireless carriers. Financial terms weren't disclosed. Although Google and the wireless carriers got a head start with their digital wallets, the concept hadn't gained much traction until Apple Pay debuted last fall. The service has become more popular than Apple expected, according to a recent presentation by CEO Tim Cook. Just three months after Apple Pay's November debut, Cook said the service accounted for two out of every three dollars spent across the three major U.S. card networks, when no card was used. About 2,000 banks and credit unions have agreed to offer Apple Pay to its customers. Apple hasn't said how many merchants are set up to handle its mobile payment services. If Apple builds on that early momentum, the Cupertino, California, company could become the leader in what is expected to be a booming market. Nearly 16 million U.S. consumers spent about $3.5 billion on tap-and-pay services last year, according to the research firm eMarketer. Apple Pay (pictured at its launch with Tim Cook)) has been a hug success. Apple Pay launched earlier this year and lets people with an iPhone 6 and 6 Plus pay for goods by tapping their handsets on NFC readers. It works by holding the phone up to a card reader and pressing a finger on the TouchID button. This confirms the person's identity, and the payment is made as if the user had presented and signed their card. All details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely. If an iPhone is lost, users can suspend all payments via the Find my iPhone service. By 2018, eMarketer predicts those figures will rise to 57 million U.S. consumers spending about $118 billion. Companies that provide mobile wallets make money by collecting processing fees from merchants and banks. Samsung Electronics, another major smartphone maker, may be ready to join the fray after buying a mobile payment startup called LoopPay. That deal, announced last week, fueled speculation that Samsung will include a digital wallet on its next phone. Apple Pay's popularity probably helped forge the unlikely alliance between Google and the wireless carriers. Google traditionally has had a prickly relationship with the carriers, largely because it doesn't believe enough has been done to upgrade wireless networks and make them cheaper so more people can spend more time online. Media reports say Google is considering selling its own wireless plans to consumers. LoopPay (left) calls itself a 'wallet solution' that lets customers pay with their phones and tablets 'virtually everywhere'. It consists of an app and a device, which is either a fob or a phone case. If the firms do partner up, LoopPay's technology could be built into Samsung phones (Galaxy S5 pictured right), tablets and watches . The pre-installation of the Wallet app is similar to what Google already does with its search engine, Gmail and YouTube on millions of other phones running on Android — an operating system that Google has been giving away for years to ensure people keep using its products on mobile devices. Google profits from the traffic by showing ads.","AT&T, Verizon Wireless and T-Mobile USA will include Google Wallet on Android phones .

"The mother of a four-year-old girl who was found unconscious and turning blue after wandering away from home at 3am has told police she had left the house to joyride and smoke marijuana. Rebecca Reyes, 23, has been arrested after her daughter was found cowering by a neighbor's door in New London, Connecticut on Friday morning and rushed to hospital with hypothermia. She called 911 at 3.38am to report that the girl was missing, and said she had woke up and found her daughter's bed empty. When police asked Reyes if she had left the house at any point, she then said she had quickly left her three children, aged five, four and two, to go to the store, and returned to find the girl gone. Scroll down for video . Arrested: Rebecca Reyes, 23, was arrested after her daughter wandered away from their home on Friday morning while Reyes went to smoke marijuana and go joyriding with a friend, police have said . But when pressed, she admitted she had left around 2am to go joyriding and smoking with a friend, before returning at 3am, NBC Connecticut reported. Responding officers also reported that the home was covered with dirty laundry  mixed with toys and food. They also said they smelled marijuana and rotting garbage, NBC reported. The children were sleeping on mattresses on the floor with no sheets or blankets, police said. Police said Reyes was unemotional and did not inquire how her daughter was when the girl was eventually found after two and a half hours. 'Detectives said they're really wasn't a lot of remorse of her at that point. She had other things going on her agenda than taking care of her children at the time,' Peter Reichard, the New London Police acting police chief, told Fox CT. Mother: Reyes, pictured, has a two-year-old son and two daughters, aged four and five . 'No remorse': Police said Reyes, pictured in court on Friday, did not ask how her four-year-old daughter was when she was found blue and unconscious after being outside for more than two hours . 'What parent in their right mind goes out at 2:00 a.m. leaves their three infants behind to score drugs?' The New London Police and Fire Departments, police from Waterford, and Connecticut State Police searched for the girl. She was discovered between a storm door and a door of a nearby apartment for warmth. She was wearing only a t-shirt, jeans and boots, police said. She was turning blue and unconscious, and her temperature had dropped to 90 degrees as outdoor temperatures plunged to just three degrees (-16C). Her fingers were red and swollen and she had 'frost nips' on her arms, back and legs, police said. The girl, who was taken to hospital for treatment, later told police officers she had woken and looked for her mother but could not find her. Scene: The girl told police she had woken up in the night and had not been able to find her mother . The child, who is now out of the hospital, and her two siblings are now being cared for by their mother's father. The girl's own father is in prison, WTNH reported. Last year, she wrote on her Facebook page beneath an image of her children: 'Everything i do is for them. Im not living for likes,for people to like who i am,i dnt care what people think abt me, all im living for since the birth of my first,is my children. Point blank. Im just being Mommy to them.' Reyes has been charged with three counts risk of injury to a minor, first-degree reckless endangerment and false statement. She appeared in court on Friday and will remain in jail on $250,000 bond. She is due back in court on March 13. See below for video .","Rebecca Reyes, 23, called police and told them she had woken up and her daughter was missing from their Connecticut home .

"With the trademark curly hair and giant personality, it is difficult for Adam Jones to blend into the background. The uninformed supporter still stops the Welsh prop in the street to commiserate with him on his country’s latest defeat, unaware that he is no longer in the squad. Jones has been a household feature in Wales teams over the last decade and is one of the most recognisable and popular figures to wear the dragon red jersey. The 33-year-old has experienced some tough autumn evenings at the Millennium Stadium, but none quite as difficult as this November, having been left out of the squad for the first time in his career. Jonathan Davies (left), Adam Jones (centre) and Ian Evans sing the Welsh national anthem . Wales coach Warren Gatland has opted for young prop Samson Lee over veteran tighhead Jones . Jones (right) moved to the Cardiff Blues from the Ospreys during the summer . The frontrower admits it has been ‘tough’ and ‘odd’ as an outsider looking in, but has still not given up hope of making next year’s World Cup squad, even if it is just to avoid those awkward moments in the supermarket. ‘Someone’s wife came up to me in Tesco and said “unlucky at the weekend, you almost beat ‘em"",' said Jones. ‘Then the bloke nudged her and said “he wasn’t playing, he wasn’t picked!” It’s happened a couple of times; people assume I was there because I’ve been involved for such a long time. I guess I’m quite recognisable with the hair and that. That’s been the hardest bit. I always had a good rapport but I haven’t given up on the dream quite yet.’ A summer move from the Ospreys to Cardiff Blues has given the forward renewed hope. Jones was caught in the crossfire of the funding row between the WRU and the Regions, which has now been resolved, and found himself unemployed and without a club when he returned from the summer tour to South Africa. Jones (left) and Wales captain Sam Warburton catch a breather against Ireland in Cardiff in February 2013 . He turned to his first club Neath, who he joined in 2000 as a part-time labourer making patio slabs. They invited the Welshman to join their pre-season training and, after coming close to hanging up his boots, Jones was offered an alluring opportunity with the Blues. ‘I’d be lying if I said I didn’t fancy knocking it on the head and saying, “f*** it, I’ll just go to university or something”,’ said Jones. ‘I missed the day-to-day camaraderie of being in a team; all the chopping and the p*** taking. You become pretty used to something when you’ve been doing it for 14 or so years. ‘Not having an income was a bit of a ball ache too, but I’d been pretty thrifty so I always had a bit saved up. It dragged on for months but I was always thought in the back of my head that I still had something to offer. Then Cardiff came in on the Sunday and it was all done by Tuesday. The whole thing made me realise how important rugby was to me. I’d have been pretty dumb to pack it all in.’ Jones and fellow front row veteran Gethin Jenkins (left) celebrate with the 2013 Six Nations title . A lack of fitness was Warren Gatland’s reason for substituting Jones 32 minutes into his milestone 100th Test against South Africa at Kings Park in June. Jones was left out of the squad for the second Test altogether and he has not played for his country since. It harked back to 2003, when Jones became known as the ’30-minute man’ after he was hauled off by Steve Hansen early in the World Cup quarter-final in Brisbane against England, but the latest episode was more painful. For a player who was being courted for interviews all week ahead of the Test in Durban, it was a huge crash down to earth. ‘It was my 100th Test match so to go from such a high to getting hauled off wasn’t nice,’ said Jones. ‘I’m not going to lie, the last week out there was hard work. I’m not sure how I would have coped without Ian Evans [the veteran second row]. I’m probably still bitter about it now but it’s happened. Jones, speaking to the media during the 2013 Lions tour of Australia, has always been a popular figure . ‘It was harder this time than in 2003, because I’m so much further down the line. I’ve got to a certain standing and achieved things, so it hurt more. When I was younger it happened and I just had to suck it and see. But I understand that Gats and these guys get paid to make these big decisions and they have to do what works for them.’ Gatland turned to 21 year-old Samson Lee, who is regarded as Jones’ long-term successor. The Scarlets prop has started every Test since Jones was ousted and has the seal of approval from the man himself. ‘Samson is excellent,’ said Jones. ‘He’s been phenomenal for his club and I think we’ve got a little gem there.

"Workers form a picket line outside the Lyondell-Basell oil refinery in Houston, Texas earlier this month . Motorists have been warned to expect a hike in gas prices as the first nationwide refinery strike in 35 years has reduced American oil production by a fifth. The United Steelworkers union have said that workers at the largest refinery in the country, Motiva Enterprises refinery in Port Arthur, Texas, started their strike at midnight on Friday. Employees at two other refineries and a chemical plant in Louisiana also planned to strike. The union said in a statement that it expanded a strike that started February 1 at refineries largely in Texas and California because the industry has refused to 'meaningfully address' safety issues through good-faith bargaining. The union also wants to discuss staffing levels and seeks limits on the use of contractors to replace union members in doing daily maintenance work. Negotiations for a new contract began on January 21 with Shell Oil Company, which is serving as the lead company in bargaining talks. Shell spokesman Ray Fisher said in an email that the company was 'extremely disappointed' with the latest development. Mr Fisher said: 'We believe this move sets the wrong tone for both parties to move forward and reach an agreement . 'We remain committed to continued safe operations and productive negotiations.' United Steelworkers represents about 30,000 workers at refineries, terminals, petrochemical plants and pipelines across the country. The walk out started with about 3,800 workers at nine refineries and then grew to include locations in Indiana and Ohio. This latest expansion adds another 1,350 employees to the strike. The workers who were to begin striking on Saturday at midnight work at Motiva refineries in Convent and Norco, Louisiana, and a Shell Chemical plant in Norco. The Port Arthur site is a joint venture between Shell and Saudi Refining Inc. It produces more than 600,000 barrels per day. Oil companies and energy experts have said that improved plant technology and strike-contingency plans should ease the blow to production from these strikes. The United Steelworkers Union said in a statement that it expanded a strike that started February 1 at refineries largely in Texas and California because the industry has refused to 'meaningfully address' safety issues through good-faith bargaining . But economists say pockets of the country served by refineries targeted in these strikes have likely already seen some impact to gas prices. That includes California, which depends more on in-state refineries for its fuel, said Amy Myers Jaffe, an energy economist at the University of California, Davis. 'The price of gasoline didn't soar in California, but it went up a little bit after the strike,' she said. She added that the labor dispute's influence on price may grow as refineries finish the maintenance work they typically do at this time of year and start preparing to increase gasoline production. She added: 'The longer it goes on, then the more likely it is going to influence gas prices.'","United Steelworkers union have expanded a strike across U.S. oil refineries .

"A Burlesque dancer has become an unlikely hero after getting fired for being 'too fat' as she says hoards of women have reached out to her in support. Ruby Rage claimed Lucky Pierre's dumped her because she was too curvy and accused the New Orleans club of having  issues with her body type. But both high-profile figures in the burlesque community, Facebook commenters and an army of women have lashed out at the French Quarter nightclub. She told WGNO ABC: 'The amount of women that have reached out to me and have told me like 'you're my hero' it hit close to home for a lot of people and in my own community here in New Orleans a lot of people have supported me. Scroll down for video . Dancer: Ruby Rage, pictured, has claimed that Lucky Pierre's let her go due to her size . Dismissal: Rage has said she was informed 'that upper management didn't think that my body type fit in with the burlesque show' 'Bella Blue has decided to pull the show from Lucky Pierre's after a lot of the attention. I know a lot of people who work at Lucky Pierre's have gotten backlash from this and it's unnecessary for employees that still work there to get harassed. 'I feel that if anyone wants to work there they should, I just wanted to make it known that this happened to me and it wasn't right.' 'I have had this happen before, I have been told 'Oh sorry, you can't do a gig because of your weight' you know it's one of those things, you show up to an interview, you interview for a spot and you don't get it, no big deal. 'It's not about me losing the job, it's not about me losing the gig, it's about someone saying I'm too big to do burlesque, I don't fit a certain body image to do burlesque and that is wrong. 'Burlesque is accepting of men, women, different genders, transgendered, it does not matter.' The club became the target of online criticism after performer Ruby Rage claimed Lucky Pierre's dumped her because of her weight. Rage had been part of 'The Blue Book Cabaret' show at the club. Rage told 21st Century Burlesque 'I have been working at Lucky Pierre’s for around a year. About three weeks ago I stopped seeing my name on the schedule, so naturally I asked about this because I thought it was a technical error with my phone/computer on my end.' 'I finally had the chance to speak with [show producer] Bella Blue, and she told me that upper management didn't think that my body type fit in with the burlesque show,' she told the website. Lucky Pierre's said in a Friday Facebook page statement 'Let's face the facts, in the long history of the art there is an expected image.' The club also said that 'The world has a standard for burlesque and our dramatically comical musical show will achieve that standard.' Lucky Pierre's cited a number of current and former burlesque stars who are not plus-size as examples, including Dita von Teese and Blaze Starr, and included a video of Miss Exotic World champion LouLou D'Vil performing. The post received hundreds of comments - many of which slammed Lucky Pierre's and came to Rage's defense. Others pointed to Miss Exotic World champion Dirty Martini as an example of a famous burlesque performer, who herself is a plus-size. Speaking out: Lucky Pierre's posted this Facebook post in regards to the controversy . Examples: Lucky Pierre cited Dita von Teese, left, and Blaze Starr, right, as examples of burlesque's 'expected image' Second message: Lucky Pierre's later posted a second statement online . Anger: The first Lucky Pierre's post has received hundreds of comments - many of which slammed the club and came to Rage's defense . D'Vil herself commented on the post, writing 'If a performer is able to entertain the audience, nothing else matters. And that's my opinion.' The Burlesque Hall of Fame criticized Lucky Pierre's message on Facebook Saturday, claiming it was factually incorrect. Writing for 21st Century Burlesque on Sunday, Dirty Martini said 'I read the statement [from Lucky Pierre's] and was interested to find that they justify their argument using some sort of burlesque time machine with examples handpicked from the past to prove their point. To this sort of logic, there is no argument. It’s like using Hitler, Mussolini and Saddam Hussein as examples of why power corrupts in politics.' Lucky Pierre's published a second Facebook statement Sunday. 'There was never a statement by any representatives of Lucky Pierre's about size,' the statement said. 'It is a shame that people are using a sensitive subject like body shaming to incite a misled mob. The standard we clearly explained was about skill, costume and entertainment.' Several Facebook comments regarding the second post accused the Bourbon Street club of 'backpedaling.' Joining in: The Burlesque Hall of Fame commented on Facebook about the controversy in the burlesque community . Statement: Ruby Rage has said 'It's the talent of the performer and what they bring to that stage that really matters' Lucky Pierre's spokesman 'AJ' told NOLA.com 'It is my understanding that the point the [Facebook] post was attempting to convey is that the changes were not specifically about size but rather the entire show. We are looking for more energy, better costumes, and more crowd participation. We have worked on this particular act since October and unfortunately there was little improvement. The worst part is this misinformation is now affecting other acts and in the end it will only hurt our loyal staff. That is very sad and I hope our fans can see past this web bashing.' On Saturday, Bella Blue wrote on Facebook 'A lot of you have asked for comment on what is going regarding what happened with Ruby Rage. I promise to make a clear and concise statement when the time is right. Please know that this situation involves and affects a lot of people and creates a ripple effect far and wide. That being said, also know that Ruby's community loves and supports her. 'On a personal note, Ruby and I are friends. We have talked extensively about this in private. And we will continue to be friends and work together for many years to come.' Blue announced that she 'will no longer be producing at Lucky Pierre's' on Facebook Monday. Daily Mail Online reached out to Rage, Blue, and Lucky Pierre's for comment. Rage directed Daily Mail Online to a statement she earlier gave to NOLA.com, which said in part 'Some may agree with Lucky Pierre's, and some may not. But the bigger picture here isn't just this, it's the fact that burlesque is something that accepts everyone. So please don't sit in the corner calling a show burlesque when you truly do no accept everyone's appearance. It's the talent of the performer and what they bring to that stage that really matters.'","Ruby Rage has claimed that Lucky Pierre's fired her due to her size .

"It may not be a fruit that you automatically reach for in the supermarket, but the large and exotic breadfruit is being touted as a wonder food. Known by its Latin name, artocarpus altilis, the fruit has lumpy green flesh and a potato-like texture so that it can be served as part of a main meal or turned into sweets. It was once a staple in the Jamaican diet and now experts believe it could provide food security on the island, which imports more than half of its food. Scroll down for video . Wonderfood? Breadfruit (pictured) - Artocarpus altilis - has lumpy green flesh and a potato-like texture so that it can be served as part of a main meal or turned into sweets . The fruit . is widely eaten throughout the Pacific Islands and more breadfruit are . produced per hectare than rice, wheat and corn, New Scientist reported. Just one breadfruit, which weighs around 7lbs (three kgs), provides the carbohydrate portion of a meal for a family of five. The fruit can be ground into flour and used in sweet and savoury dishes, including pancakes and crisps. It is rich in vitamins and minerals, as well as being a high source of gluten-free carbohydrate and protein. The protein in the fruit has a higher proportion of aminio acids than soy. Diane Ragone of Hawaii’s National . Tropical Botanical Garden (NTBG) has been studying the plant since the . 1980s, which some people say is bland and starchy. Mary McLaughlin, founder of the charity Trees that Feed, said that the high-protein fruit can be used to make pancakes. A third of a cup of breadfruit flour is added to the same quantity of orange juice as well as one egg, cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla. The mixture is fried in a pan and this recipe makes pancakes for three people. Breadfruit crisps and pasta are being developed so that the food can be more easily stored. The NTBG said that mature breadfruit is a healthy substitute for any starchy food such as rice and potatoes if it is boiled, steamed or baked. Small immature fruit can be boiled, pickled and marinated. They are said to taste like artichoke hearts. Ripe fruits are creamy and sweet and can be eaten raw or used to make cakes and pies. Even the flowers found on the trees can be candied and eaten as sweets. She has studied . hundreds of varieties from 34 countries. Together . with Nyree Zerega of Northwestern University in Chicago, she traced back . the roots of the fruit using DNA analysis to the breadfruit ‘Eve’. Most . of the fruit she examined included fingerprints of a plant called . the breadnut that grows in New Guinea. The breadnut is thought to be the . ancestor of the breadfruit. In 2003 Dr Ragone created the NTBG’s Breadfruit Institute, which includes an orchard on the island of Maui. Scientists . there are working with the charity Alliance to End Hunger with the aim . of distributing breadfruit to places without a regular supply of food . across the world. ‘Traditionally in Polynesia you would plant a breadfruit when a child . was born, because that would guarantee food throughout the child’s life’ Dr Zerega said. Breadfruit trees require little care and thrive in the tropics. Now . experts are investigating which varieties best suit certain . environments and climates – as well as local tastes – in countries . lacking food security. Breadfruit (pictured) was once a staple in the diet of Jamaicans and experts think it could provide food security on the island, which imports more than half of its food. It is viatamin and mineral rich, as well as being a high source of gluten-free carbohydrate and protein . Just one breadfruit, which weighs around seven lbs (three kilograms) provides the carbohydrate portion of a meal for a family of five. The fruit can be ground into flour and used in sweet and savoury dishes, including pancakes and crisps . Breadfruit was first bought to the Caribbean in the 18th Century to feed slaves. Lieutenant William Bligh first bought the fruit to Jamaica from Tahiti. It is said that on the way, his crew mutinied and set him adrift, dumping the cargo of breadfruit plants overboard with him. On his second attempt as a captain in 1792, he brought 2,000 of the plants to Jamaica and 678 bore fruit. Intended as a stable and cheap food for slaves, breadfruit was not much liked and it took around 50 years for it to be incorporated willingly into local dishes. Scientists think that the fruit's ancestor is the breadnut, which is native to New Guinea. Breadfruit is so called because of its high . carbohydrate and fibre content. When it is just ripe enough to eat, it . is more like bread as it is starchy and dry, but  when it is softer and . riper it tastes sweeter and is more moist. They are also identifying which varieties of the fruit produce the best yields and protein content. They think that some of the fruit are highly tolerant to salt, which could prove important in the Caribbean as sea levels rise. However, some varieties of breadfruit relied upon by people in the eastern Pacific are proving to be less robust. Scientists are trying to use tissue culture methods to create breadfruit trees that yield more fruit sooner. While progress is difficult, the experts have grown disease-free trees that start bearing fruit at two years of age – three years sooner than is usual. From the varieties propagated, 35,000 trees have now been sent to 26 countries, including Jamaica and Haiti. A variety called Ma’afala, which is native to Samoa, bears fruit a different time to varieties found in the Caribbean, extending the time when the nutritious fruit is available. It is hoped that one day there could be forests of breadfruit trees throughout the Caribbean. The starchy fruit can be ground into flour and used in sweet and savoury dishes, including pancakes and crisps (pictured)","Breadfruit has lumpy green flesh and a potato-like texture .

"A 13-year-old girl suspected of stabbing a classmate to please the internet meme Slender Man told police she was 'excited' to kill her friend - because she thought it would help prove the horror character exists. Anissa Weier and friend Morgan Geyser, who were 12 at the time of the alleged incident, also told police different accounts of the horrific act when they were interviewed in the Milwaukee suburb of Waukesha, Wisconsin. The pair are accused of knifing Peyten Lautner 19 times before leaving her for dead in the woods on May 31, 2014. She managed to save herself by crawling to get help from a passing bicyclist.

Survived: Peyton Lautner (above) was stabbed 19 times in the woods on May 31, 2014. She managed to save herself by crawling out of the woods and flagging down a passing bicyclist . Harrowing: Morgan is seen with blood on her shirt during the interrogation (above) A video of the suspects' chilling interrogation was released by police last week. During questioning, the girls told officers they tried to kill the girl to appease the mythical character. One of them however said: 'I was excited because I wanted proof that he existed because there were a bunch of skeptics out there saying he didn't exist. 'I was afraid of what would happen if I didn't ... I didn't want to find out what would happen if we didn't.' According to NBC, one of the girls said the other told her they could become Slender Man's 'proxies' if they killed the victim . In the video of the interview, obtained by WISN, the girls both say they told Peyton they wanted to go bird watching, this after planning their attack on the school bus. 'People who trust you become very gullible,' Morgan told police.  'And it was sort of sad.' Anissa is more emotional during her interview, wiping away tears at one point. Anissa said at one point Slender Man would kill their families if they did not kill Peyton . 'We told her we were going to get help,' she told police about the moments after the two stabbed Peyton. ' 'But we weren't. We were going to run and let her pass away. So we ran.' The girls were running off to find Slender Man, and were later picked up walking along a highway off-ramp, and Morgan had a knife in her backpack. In the interrogation video, Morgan can also been seen with blood on her shirt, which she has photographed at one point. She also begins singing to herself at one point during the six-hour interview, and told police of her plan; 'You have no idea how difficult it was not to tell anyone. I knew we'd get in trouble.' When she described the actually stabbing, she said; 'It just sort of happened. It didn't feel like anything. It was like air.' Morgan and Anissa said they stabbed their friend to appease the Slender Man . As for Slender Man, Morgan described him as a man with 'tendrils that are very sharp.' 'I see him in my dreams,' she told police, . Anissa said in her interview that she did not have the same visions as Morgan, but knew she had to kill her friend for the Slender Man. 'I decided to go along, tag along, to prove the skeptics wrong,' she said. Then, when asked if she saw the Slender Man, she told police; 'Uh huh, after Morgan stabbed [Peyton].' She also revealed that Morgan said to her; 'I kinda sorta made a deal with Slender saying that if I didn't, if we didn't kill Peyton that he would, would either or could kill our families and everything we love.' The two girls are charged in adult court with attempted first-degree intentional homicide. If convicted, each could be sentenced to up to 65 years in the state prison system. Their attorneys want their cases moved to children's court where a conviction could send them to a secure facility until age 25. Waukesha County Circuit Judge Michael Bohren said he intends to issue a ruling in the case March 13.","Anissa Weier and Morgan Geyser have been accused of stabbing Peyton Lautner 19 times in Waukesha, Wisconsin, in May 2014 .

"For many people, becoming a parent is the most important task in life. For one MP, however, children are simply the ‘opium of the masses’. Conservative backbencher Rory Stewart has hit out at people who think of their offspring as their ‘purpose’ in life – despite admitting he would like to become a father himself. He said: ‘If we say the purpose of life is our children, that’s neither a purpose nor a meaning. But I’m sure I will be as besotted as everybody else when I have them.’ Conservative MP Rory Stewart says people should not let their lives be driven or defined by having children . Playing on revolutionary Karl Marx’s infamous statement that ‘religion is the opium of the masses’, Mr Stewart described children as the new ‘opium’. His comments come just five months after he criticised society for worshipping children as they once worshipped God. On that occasion he also compared children to ‘opium’, but focused his attack on society’s tendency to prioritise the needs of young people over the elderly. It is not known what the 41-year-old’s wife Shoshana Clark, 33, will make of his comments, which he made in an interview with the Radio Times. The pair, who have been married for almost two years, have yet to have children of their own. They first met when she and her first husband, an aid worker, moved to work for the Turquoise Mountain Foundation, a charity Mr Stewart set up in 2006. The MP made the comments in an interview with the Radio Times magazine . She became its chief executive a few months later and moved in with him after ditching her husband in 2010. Mr Stewart, who is MP for Penrith and the Border, has made a documentary about the boundary between Scotland and England for BBC2, called The Story of Britain’s Lost Middleland. Before entering Parliament, he served as a soldier and a diplomat and wrote a book about his experiences walking across Afghanistan. Mr Stewart said his life is ‘slower’ now he is an MP, adding: ‘Being a backbench MP is a bit of an anti-climax for a superhero.’ And he said politicians have less power than many voters realised: ‘The politicians think the journalists have power, the journalists think bankers have power, bankers think lawyers have power. The truth is, nobody has power.’ The MP – who is Scottish – is campaigning against Scottish independence and thinks Hadrian’s Wall is a ‘pernicious scar across the landscape’. But he said he was unable to talk about his campaign while promoting his new documentary because it ‘might put the BBC in a difficult position’. He added: ‘I think I probably began filming feeling that what the programme would discover was that there was a strong sense of British identity and that there would be no difference either side of the border. ‘But I found that Scottishness and Englishness are actually strong, instinctive things, whatever the historical reasons. Even the accent changes – just two inches across the border.’","Rory Stewart says children are 'neither a purpose nor a meaning'

"An Ohio police dog that went missing two months ago and gained 24,000 Facebook followers on a page created by his owner has finally been found safe and sound. K-9 Karson and his handler, officer Jerry Popp, shared an emotional reunion on Sunday after the dog saw Popp and immediately jumped into the front seat of his police truck. Popp said he fell to the snow and cried after they found his furry friend. He ran away on December 20. Officer Jerry Popp has been reunited with his K9 Karson, who gained nearly 24,000 followers on Facebook while he was missing . After Karson saw his owner he immediately jumped into Popp's truck, where they shared an emotional hug . But the reunion wasn't quick, according to a post Popp wrote on Karson's Facebook page. Although Popp called commands to Karson he was not close enough to be seen, and the scared dog began to run from the truck. Popp ran for the Belgian Malinois on foot, while Sergeant Ron Fithen pursued him in their truck. After the dog finally gave up and stopped running, Fithen got out of the truck and laid down in the snow. Popp wrote that Fithen wanted to appear 'small and nonthreatening' as he began to talk to the K9. Popp then walked behind Karson, who immediately jumped into the truck when he saw him. As Popp fell the ground and cried, Fithen and a lost dog specialist consoled him and then enveloped him in a group hug. 'Getting the furry boy home is just a loss of words,'  Fithen told WLWT 5. 'Just being there at the moment when I met eyes with Karson knowing he was coming home today that - that has made my year.' Karson at first ran from Popp and his fellow officer because he didn't recognize them and was scared . Popp fell to the ground and cried after Karson was finally safe and found in the truck. An officer and lost dog specialist comforted the handler before enveloping him in a group hug . Popp immediately updated Karson's Facebook fans after the rescue. 'Karson has been found. I have him in the truck next to me,' he wrote. # . 'He's alive and healthy. It's all over finally.' The K9 went missing two days before Christmas after escaping from a boarding kennel where he was staying while Popp was on vacation. Karson lost 14 pounds while he was away, surviving record-breaking low temperatures. Popp said he was getting plenty of sleep and being very quiet as he recovered at home. The devoted handler posted frequent updates about Karson after he went missing, keeping the dog's followers informed as the police received numerous sightings and tips. Karson's Facebook page had a devoted following and users were overjoyed to hear of the dog's safe return . Facebook users shared their joy with news of the dog's return. 'I can't say how relieved I am for you and your family and the department,' one user wrote. 'I along with my 9 year old daughter have been following you and K9 Karson since day one. We have checked this site everyday over a hundred times a day reading every post and hoping Karson would be found.' Another user advised Popp to get some much needed sleep. 'Rest well with your boy... cause he has thousands of tennis balls to play with you,' they wrote. Police Chief Duane Weyand said Karson wasn't 'just a dog' but a member of the department and the community. 'That's been our driving force that he belongs here. He's one of us.'

"A teenage girl who was left in a coma after a suspected hit-and-run has spoken out for the first time. In an interview with Nine Network's A Current Affair on Tuesday night, April Lee Gillen tried to recall the night that changed her life. The 17-year-old, of Berkeley which is south of Sydney, also told of the shocking moment she woke up to discover that she was pregnant. Police, who described the hit-and-run incident 10 months ago as 'a horrific and violent attack against a young vulnerable girl', have also revealed the case is now being investigated as an attempted abduction. Scroll down for video . A teenage girl who was left in a coma after a suspected hit-and-run has spoken out for the first time . April Lee Gillen was on life support after suspected hit-and-run 10 months ago . Police, who described the incident 10 months ago as 'a horrific and violent attack against a young vulnerable girl', have also revealed the case is now being investigated as an attempted abduction . While she was in hospital, April discovered she was pregnant and gave birth to her son on Christmas Eve . April was walking home after a date with her boyfriend on the night of April 19 when police claim she was hit by a car. At about 2am the following morning, April was found on the kerbside and was quickly rushed to hospital in a critical condition. Daily Mail Australia previously reported the teen was admitted to hospital in a critical condition after suffering 'extensive head injuries' a police statement said in April. In what could be a clue for investigators, she is believed to have posted the following status to her Facebook account shortly before the incident. 'Phones on 1 percent walking from warrawong to berks (Berkeley) and some Asian guy just stopped me telling me to come home with him cause it's safe and I need help wtf sos'. According to police, a number of residents near Northcliffe Drive in Lake Heights - where April Lee was hit - heard a 'loud noise' shortly before the critically injured teenager was found bloodied on the side of the road. Daily Mail Australia previously reported the teen was admitted to hospital in a critical condition after suffering 'extensive head injuries' a police statement said in April . Many questions are still left unanswered for April (left) and her mother Leonie (right) In what could be a clue for investigators, she is believed to have posted the following status to her Facebook account shortly before the incident . At the time Lake Illawarra Inspector Steve Worthington told reporters: '(The Facebook message) is certainly vital information our detectives are following up, but until we can speak to April herself, we need further information from the public.' April was in an induced coma for two weeks with a severe brain injury. 'After I found out that it was an abduction I was terrified,' she told A Current Affair. 'If I didn't put up that fight I could be dead right now.' But there were many questions that still remain unanswered for April to this day. 'I just think: ""Why me? Why did you pick me out of all people?"",' she said. 'I wouldn't wish this on anyone - what I went through... no other teenager girls.' And as April continued her recovery for two months at Wollongong Hospital, she also made another shocking discovery. According to police, a number of residents near Northcliffe Drive in Lake Heights - where April Lee was hit - heard a 'loud noise' shortly before the critically injured teenager was found bloodied on the side of the road . Police releaved CCTV footage of a black BMW SUV that was near where April was found . 'Am I pregnant? Oh my goodness!' April recalled the moment when her sister broke the news. 'I said to mum it's my little baby. I'm giving birth to him and bringing him into this world so I'm not going to think about getting rid of him at all.' But for mother Leonie, who initially thought she had lost her daughter, her concerns grew about whether April was able to raise a child. 'Later on as April healed much more she was clearer, well spoken and quite determined in what she wanted so I said to April I will be right by her side. And it's the best decision we've made,' she said. Baby Jacobie was born on Christmas Eve and April is grateful for her mum's support. 'Thank God my mum's there beside me. She helps me a whole lot.

"A renowned poet was murdered by her stepson in an argument at her idyllic country farmhouse, a court has heard. Writer Anne Cluysenaar, 79, was stabbed to death by stepson Timothy Jackson, 48, with a kitchen knife during a family row. University lecturer Ms Cluysenaar was found with knife wounds to her chest and neck at her Little Wentwood Farm in Usk, South Wales. Jackson is now facing life in prison after pleading guilty to murder at Cardiff Crown Court. Anne Cluysenaar was stabbed to death at her home last November following a family row. Her stepson Timothy Jackson (right) has now admitted her murder . The court heard the peace of the picturesque home she had set up with Jackson's father Walter, 77, was shattered on November 1 when her stepson visited from his home in Sheffield. The couple had celebrated their 39th wedding anniversary the day before she was murdered. Police and paramedics were called following a violent family argument and discovered Ms Cluysenaar's body in the living room. Prosecutor Roger Thomas QC said Jackson picked up the murder weapon from a sideboard during an argument with his stepmother. He said: 'The knife was clearly a household knife and was in the room and when the murder took place. 'It was obviously picked up in the course of the incident that took place.' Ms Cluysenaar and her husband lived at their cottage in South Wales for 25 years before the brutal murder . Belgium-born Ms Cluysenaar came to Britain after her family fled the Nazis during World War Two. She started writing poetry as an eight-year-old and went on to write hundreds of poems in her life which were printed in literary journals and magazines. She had also lectured in literature and linguistics at universities across the country including Manchester, Dublin and Aberdeen. Anne moved to the smallholding with her husband Walter and had lived there for more than 25 years before her brutal murder. Jackson was remanded in custody and told to expect to serve a lengthy jail term when he is sentenced next month.","Police found writer's body dead after family row at South Wales home .

"It’s a chocoholic’s worst nightmare: a disease ravages cocoa crops, causing a worldwide chocolate shortage and the price of sweets to soar. But a steamy greenhouse near London is helping to ensure that cocoa crops around the world remain disease-free. The International Cocoa Quarantine Centre (ICQC) is nurturing quarantined cocoa plants so that they can be shared with cocoa-producing countries to produce new, more disease-resistant varieties. The International Cocoa Quarantine Centre (ICQC) is designed to nurture quarantined cocoa plants so that they can be shared with cocoa-producing countries to produce new, more disease resistant varieties. This image shows a researcher taking cocoa beans from an opened cocoa fruit inside the facility . Inside the ICQC, the plants thrive tropical conditions where the air is a balmy 23°C (73 °C). ‘Cocoa plants are generally quite difficult plants to grow,’ said Heather Lake, a technician at the newly-revamped centre, which is funded half by the British chocolate industry and half by the US government. ‘They don't like too much sunlight, they don't like too much shade. It's quite difficult to get the climate correct.’ Hosted by the University of Reading and situated in the village of Arborfield, west of London, the ICQC boasts 400 cocoa plant varieties, grown in 10,760 square feet (1,000 square metres) of greenhouse space. Cocoa plants are difficult to grow because they need the right mix of sunlight and shade. Here, horticultural technician Heather Lake checks the leaves of young cocoa plants  for pests . A steamy greenhouse near London (pictured) is helping to ensure that cocoa crops around the world remain free of diseases to cope with our growing appetite for sweet treats and keep it affordable . At a time when changing tastes in emerging economies like China and India are fuelling global demand for chocolate(stock image), the centre acts as a vital resource for producer countries when pests or droughts strike crops . Chocolate drinks were made as early in 1,900BC. The Mokaya and pre-Olmec people of Mesoamerica first roasted and ground cocoa beans to make 'chocolate'. The Aztecs believed that cacao seeds were the gift of Quetzalcoatl, the God of wisdom, and the seeds had so much value they were used as a form of currency. The Latin name for the cocoa tree is Theobroma Cacao which means ‘Food of the Gods’. Originally prepared as a drink, chocolate was served as a bitter, frothy liquid and was often mixed with spices, wine or corn. It was believed to give the drinker strength and boost their libido. Sugar was first added to cocoa in the 16th century when chocolate became popular the form we now recognise. It was originally only eaten by the rich. Chocolate houses sprang up in London in the seventeenth century and were frequented by the upper classes - by 1700 there were 2,000 in the capital. By the 20th century, the sweet was popular with all classes and chocolate was considered a staple and featured in war ration packs. The UK has the seventh highest consumption of chocolate in the world. The average Briton eats 17.49lbs (8kg) of chocolate per year, according to The World Atlas of Chocolate, but Switzerland takes the top spot. A total of 40 per cent of chocolate is consumed in Europe. Its aim is to reduce the amount of diseases affecting cocoa plants by quarantining them before sharing them with different countries to produce new, more resistant varieties. Diseases such as Black Pod and Mirid can decimate valuable crops. Andrew Daymond, manager of the ICQC, told MailOnline that there are various fungal diseases of cocoa such as blackpod, which is found worldwide, witches broom disease in South America and frosty pod rot, which is found in Central America and parts of South America. 'These all spread by fungal spores. Another disease that it important in West Africa is Cocoa Swollen Shoot virus. This is spread by insect vectors.' Most of the efforts to increase cocoa supply are geared towards improving yields on existing farms rather than increasing the area cultivated. Breeding of improved varieties that have better resistance to pests and diseases and higher yield potential is one route to achieve this and at the same time improve farmer livelihoods. The plants in the greenhouse were grown from cuttings or seeds collected from disease-free crops in the wild, on expeditions to the tropics. At a time when changing tastes in emerging economies like China and India are fuelling global demand for chocolate, the centre acts as a vital resource for producer countries when pests or droughts strike crops. ‘That's where we come into play,’ said Dr Daymond, which was set up 30 years ago. ‘We are the main hub for international movements of cocoa plants.’ New plants are needed because almost three quarters of the world’s cocoa is grown in West Africa, despite originating from South America, according to the International Cocoa Organisation. Such a heavy concentration of production in one region - the Ivory Coast and Ghana alone represent 60 percent - makes it vulnerable to shocks. For example, the price of cocoa jumped to almost $3,400 (£2,202) a tonne in September, amid fears that the Ebola crisis in West Africa could affect cocoa supplies. Both Ivory Coast and Ghana have so far been spared by the outbreak, but Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, which collectively produce 0.7 per cent of the world’s cocoa, saw their yields plummet when the disease struck. Cocoa prices later rebounded, and even rose 15 per cent overall, last year. There is also the potential threat to the industry from plant diseases, which in West Africa can mean up to one third of the annual harvest is lost. The plants in the greenhouse were grown from cuttings or seeds collected from disease-free crops in the wild, on expeditions to the tropics. Here, technician Heather Lake checks the plants for signs of disease, which are all hooked up to a watering system to ensure they thrive . Hosted by the University of Reading and situated in the village of Arborfield, west of London, the ICQC boasts 400 cocoa plant varieties, grown in 10,760 square feet  of greenhouse space. An image showing on variety of cocoa, and a pod is pictured left, and right, a technician polinates buds from flowers on a cocoa plant . New plants are needed because almost three quarters of the world’s cocoa is grown in west Africa, making it more vulnerable to pests and disease, according to the International Cocoa Organisation. Here, a technician hand pollinates buds from flowers on a cocoa plant, to ensure the crop thrives . Dr Daymond explained: ‘In each cocoa-growing country, they face particular challenges to do with pest and diseases, low yield potential of planted materials, extreme weather events. ‘The basic objective of the project is to allow safe movement of cocoa plants from one part of the world to another.’ Because Britain has no endemic pests or diseases affecting cocoa, the centre can grow resistant varieties before dispatching them around the world. The current quarantine procedure involves experts looking for signs of disease over a two year period, but research is under way to speed up the process. Because Britain has no endemic pests or diseases affecting cocoa, the centre can grow resistant varieties before dispatching them around the world. More mature cocoa plants are shown . ‘When we do an export, we send the small branches off a tree…we then remove all the leaves and we just send a stick,’ Dr Daymond said. He explained that producer countries can then ‘establish a plant that is genetically identical to the plant that they received the cutting from’. The centre also researches the effects of climate change on cocoa crops and is looking at developing new varieties that would be more resistant to droughts or increased carbon dioxide levels, in a bid to meet the demand for chocolate.

Experts at Kew Gardens are advising the coffee industry how to grow more resilient plants, amid fears that the Arabica variety will be wiped out by the end of the century. The Ethiopian bean - the world’s most popular type of coffee - is severely threatened by drought. With dry weather predicted to become more frequent in east Africa, Arabica plants could be eradicated in the wild by 2080, experts say. Experts at Kew Gardens are advising the coffee industry how to grow more resilient plants, amid fears that the Arabica variety will be wiped out by the end of the century. A stock image of arabica beans is shown . This is because those growing in coffee plantations are from limited genetic stock and are unlikely to have the flexibility required to cope with repeated dry spells and other threats, such as pests and diseases. Now horticulturists from the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew are finding alternative species and educating coffee giants. Professor Kathy Willis, head of science at Kew, said: ‘We’re finding alternative species and talking to Starbucks and Sainsbury’s and other big coffee importers and producers so that information flows through to big business. ‘By 2050-2080 there could be a 100 per cent reduction in Arabica coffee in the wild because of the dry, so we will need to move to the other 124 species of coffee.’ This is because those growing in coffee plantations are from limited genetic stock and are unlikely to have the flexibility required to cope with repeated dry spells and other threats, such as pests and diseases, which could potentially create a shortage of good coffee (a stock image is shown) She said Kew coffee research head Aaron Davis was looking in countries such as Madagascar for more resistant strains of coffee that can be grown with better climatic tolerance than Arabica, but lots of the varieties found there taste ‘horrible’. While there are almost 125 species of coffee, Arabica is the most popular by far and is considered the most important global commodity, after oil. Kew is setting up a new company in May called Kew Consultancy Services to sell commercially useful information. ‘We are focusing Kew’s science in those areas where we can truly make a unique impact on people’s lives, thanks to our unrivalled collection of specimens and the world-leading expertise of our evolutionary botanists, mycologists, taxonomists and systematists, Professor Willis said. Kew has cut 100 jobs in the last eight months - half from the science department - after a cut in Government funding.","The International Cocoa Quarantine Centre (ICQC) is based near London .

"Helpless whimpers carried through the frigid Minnesota night air led a passing truck driver to a burning trash can, at the bottom of which he spotted a puppy engulfed in flames. Clayton Van Wert said he was visiting the garbage dump on the edge of the Red Lake Indian Reservation Friday night when he made the shocking discovery. With little regard for his own safety, Mr Van Wert, a father of three, reached into the flames and pulled the crying pup to safety, burning his hands and singeing his hair in the process. Burnt to a crisp: Truck driver Clayton Van Wert took this heart-wrenching photo just minutes after pulling this tiny puppy from a burning trash bin in Minnesota. He said his fur was the color of charred marshmallow . Survivor: The 5-month-old husky mix is lucky to be alive after being pulled from a burning trash bin by a Good Samaritan Friday night in Minnesota . Torched: The puppy's fur was charred and had to be shaved off so that the medics could assess his skin . Skin and bones: Phoenix is five months old, but doctors say he was brought in weighing only 19lbs . The trucker is convinced that the husky mix was too small to jump into the 4-foot-tall container on his own, suggesting that someone had deliberately tossed the pooch in and left him for dead. Van Wert contacted a tribal conservation officer, who took the badly burned dog to a rescue shelter on the reservation. From there, the pooch was transferred to Act V Rescue and Rehabilitation, an animal shelter in Bloomington. Dr Vicki Schulz, the veterinarian who has been treating the pup, appropriately dubbed Phoenix after the mythological bird that rose from the ashes after being burned, says most of the dog's hair was charred to a crisp. The rescue team revealed in a Facebook post Sunday that Phoenix is five months old but was brought in weighing only 19lbs - or about half of what a dog like that should weigh. The severely malnourished puppy suffered the most serious burns on his knees and two of his paws, leaving him in pain that requires medications. Worse for wear: The malnourished pup suffered the most serious burns on his knees and two of his paws . Road to recovery: Phoenix will undergo several rounds of skin grafting for his burns . Four-legged victim: Clayton Van Wert, the truck driver who rescued the pooch, said given Phoenix's size, there is no way he could have jumped inside the 4-foot-tall trash bin on his own . Talking to the Minneapolis Star Tribune about his heroic rescue, Mr Van Wert, 55, who owns a towing and auto recovery company, choked back tears as he recounted the moment he reached into the burning bin and retrieved the howling puppy with his gloved hands. Van Wert, himself a lifelong dog owner, said as soon as the pooch was out of danger, he walked over to him on his burned paws and showed no trace of fear. Van Wert said the top of the puppy's fur was the color of toasted marshmallow and crumbled to ashes at the slightest touch. Phoenix is now on the road to recovery, but he still has to undergo several rounds of skin grafting for his burns. The team at Act V who are treating the abandoned puppy are asking for donations to cover the mounting costs of his care. As of Monday night, authorities have not found whoever dumped the dog in the burning bin.","Clayton Van Wert, 55, heard whimper coming from a trash container Friday night and found a tiny husky mix engulfed in flames inside .

"A young man who suffered a horrific brain injury will embark on an incredible charity bike ride as a moving memorial for his friend, Kim Hunt, who was killed in a tragic murder-suicide. Ms Hunt; a beloved intensive care nurse, wife and mother, was found dead in September last year as a result of a suspected murder-suicide. Her husband Geoff and their three young children Fletcher, Mia and Phoebe were also tragically found dead on their country property, all with gunshot wounds. Mrs Hunt suffered from a traumatic brain injury after a car crash in 2012. Just weeks beforehand and mere kilometres away, fellow Lockhart resident Luke Stojanovic sustained very similar injuries after a bike accident. A photograph taken of friend Kim Hunt (left) and Luke Stojanovic (right) before Kim's tragic death, during one of their 'many dinners in the courtyard together at Liverpool Brain Injury Unit' The Hunt family, Geoff (back left), Kim (back right) and their children (left to right) Phoebe, Mia and Fletcher, were all tragically killed in a suspected murder-suicide in September 2014 . Luke Stojanovic (left) just days after his accident at the high dependency ward in Canberra with his lifelong best friend, motocross champion Jackson Strong . Stojanovic, 22, is now preparing to ride to honour Mrs Hunt and to raise money for the Liverpool Brain Trauma Unit and Wagga Base Hospital Intensive Care Unit. The hospitals were vital in helping both himself and Mrs Hunt recover from their traumatic brain injuries and is also the place where their friendship was formed. The road ride has long been a dream for the 22-year-old and he had often discussed his plans with Ms Hunt. ‘Kim had indicated that she would like to support Luke by riding part of the way with him,’ family friend and the fundraiser organiser, Mandy Strong told Daily Mail Australia. ‘We say to him “Kim is there with you, she’s just sitting on your shoulder keeping you going.’ Stojanovic will ride a staggering 180 kilometres on his charity ride. He will set off from Ramsay Private Hospital in Nowra, where he is currently undergoing rehabilitation as an outpatient, and finish in Liverpool where he spent nine months after his accident. Mr Stojanovic (left) and Mrs Hunt (right) were both Lockhart residents and formed a close friendship as they fought to overcome their brain injuries . Kim (in red, holding daughter Mia) is remembered as a loving wife, mother and friend. She was also a dedicated intensive care nurse and showed incredible strength to overcome a horrific brain injury . He hopes to raise money to help brain injury sufferers along the way. ‘I am calling my ride the Luke Stono’s “Never Give up Ride”,’ said Mr Stojanovic. ‘I want to undertake this fundraising event to help others like myself so they can better themselves and be the best they can be.’ He hopes to complete the ride in 10 days from April 22 to May 1. 'I will do this by riding a recumbent push bike that has been specially modified to suit my disability,’ explained Stojanovic. The driven 22-year-old is focussed on using the event to commemorate the wonderful Hunt family. He and the Lockhart community want people everywhere to learn about what Kim achieved as a nurse, a brain injury sufferer and as a friend. Stojanovic also hopes the ride will send a message of hope to other people with brain injuries, as evidence of what they are capable of achieving. The pair, both residents a small town in the NSW Riverina named Lockhart, formed a close bond as they both fought to recover from their brain trauma. ‘Both accidents were really similar, just weeks and kilometres apart from each other,’ said Jackson Strong, Luke’s lifelong best friend and a renowned motocross star. The road ride has long been a dream for the 22-year-old and he had often discussed his plans with Ms Hunt. She had promised to ride part of the way with Luke to support him . A poster promoting one half of the fundraising campaign, made by Kim Hunt's sister Jenny Blake . The Lockhart community will come together for a charity ride on March 7 to raise funds for brain injury sufferers and to remember the beloved Hunt family (pictured) On June 20, 2012 Stojanovic, then a 20-year-old up-and-coming motocross rider, missed a seat grab and landed on his head whilst training for motor cross stunt riding. Shortly afterwards, on July 14, Ms Hunt suffered life-threatening injuries when she flipped her car twice while on the road leading to her Lockhart home. Her then-four year old daughter Phoebe was also in the vehicle and suffered minor injuries . The two Lockhart residents met and formed a tight bond at the very beginning of their long road to recovery. ‘Luke and the Hunt family made a connection in hospital and that never ended. 'Whenever Luke came to Lockhart, Kim and the Hunt family would always make sure they all came up to spend time with him,’ Mr Strong told Daily Mail Australia. Mr Stojanovic is motivated to raise money to improve the resources at the two hospitals to help provide care for other people who are suffering. ‘Throughout my days in Liverpool Hospital I was able to meet others of all ages with different degrees of brain injuries, who were fighting their own battles and who in return were inspirational people to me,’ said Mr Stojanovic. ‘After spending so much time in the Rehab Unit, I realised that these people, and the Brain Injury Unit overall, would benefit from new equipment and a total make over.’ Kim and Luke gave each other a lot of strength and lifted each other with their friendship. Mr Stojanovic has made incredible progress thanks to his determined efforts to recover from his injury. He is pictured with his friends shortly after the accident in June 2012 . Mandy and Jackson Strong are organising the Lockhart bike ride and say the community will do anything to keep the memory of the Hunt family alive . ‘They went through the same hospital circuits and the families became quite close. They maintained a connection,’ agreed Mr Strong. ‘Going through the same thing with a brain injury, it was so good for them to be able to talk with each other.’ ‘Kim recovered more quickly than Luke so she was also inspirational for him, motivating him by showing him what he is capable of achieving.’ The bike ride is an important step for Luke and the rest of the community who mourn the deaths of the treasured Hunt family. ‘When the tragedy happened it hit Luke pretty hard and he wants to do everything he can to keep their memory alive,' said Mr Strong. ‘I think everyone in the community feels the same and they will do whatever they can.’ ‘The whole ride is about what an amazing person Kim was, the recovery she had and keeping awareness alive for people in the same situation. ‘Kim and Luke’s lives show people that they can make something positive out of it.’ Before Stojanovic embarks on his ride, the Lockhart community will come together and hold ‘The Kim Hunt and Family Memorial Ride’ to raise funds for two intensive care units and show their support . Stojanovic has worked tirelessly to recover from his brain injury, spending hours a day on the bike at the gym at his rehab centre. ‘Luke rides a specially remodelled bike. He does a lot of training and goes for rides. He does up to 60 kilometres a day, depending on his fitness.’ ‘I’ll be riding next to him but probably only go be able to go half as far as Luke will. He’s pretty fit!,’ said Mr Strong. Before Stojanovic embarks on his ride, the Lockhart community will come together and hold ‘The Kim Hunt and Family Memorial Ride’ to raise funds for two intensive care units and show their support. Members of the community will ride 93 kilometres from Wagga to Lockhart on March 7. ‘I am extremely lucky to have the love and support of all my family, friends and our local community,' said Mr Stojanovic. 'Also for dedicated nurses, doctors, rehab physiotherapists and everyone who is helping me with my recovery' Kim and Luke formed a close friendship during their recovery. Whenever Luke came home to Lockhart Kim, her husband Geoff and their three young children (L to R) Phoebe, Fletcher and Mia would always visit . People are encouraged to take part in the day in whatever way they can, whether it be riding part of the way by joining in at Mangoplan and The Rock, joining in for a barbeque at Lockhart Swimming Pool. Mrs Strong is campaigning for people to donate online to help raise funds for the intensive care units that made such a difference to Mr Stojanovic and Mrs Hunt’s lives. It is also fitting as Mrs Hunt had been a dedicated and caring nurse who spent so much time helping those in need at both Wagga Wagga Base Hospital and Lockhart District Hospital. ‘I am extremely lucky to have the love and support of all my family, friends and our local community. 'Also, for the dedicated nurses, doctors, rehab physiotherapists and everyone who is helping me with my recovery,’ said Mr Stojanovic. The response from the community has been astounding according to Mrs Strong. ‘It’s what small towns do best. They look after each other and help each other through.’ For more information visit the Facebook page here.

"HSBC is having to weather yet more controversy after the United States named it as one of the banks it's investigating over the possible manipulation of precious metals markets. The British banking giant is already mired in a scandal surrounding allegations that it helped wealthy clients dodge taxes and was fined last year for manipulating foreign currency markets. Now it is being probed over the fixing of gold, silver, platinum and palladium prices. HSBC is having to weather yet more controversy after the United States named it as one of the banks it's investigating over the possible manipulation of precious metals markets . The banks probed by the US government over possible manipulation of precious metals markets also include  Bank of Nova Scotia, Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Societe Generale, Standard Bank and UBS . Barclays, previously fined for the attempted manipulation of the Libor financial benchmark, is also being probed. The investigation is being carried out by the Justice Department with help from Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates raw materials and derivatives . The Bank of Nova Scotia, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Societe Generale, Standard Bank and UBS are also under the spotlight, according to the Wall Street Journal. The probes are at the preliminary stage, but HSBC, in releasing yearly results Monday, noted requests from the Justice Department and the CFTC over the precious metals probe, the Journal said. A trove of leaked documents shows that HSBC's Swiss private bank turned a blind eye to illegal activities of arms dealers and blood diamond traders while helping rich people evade taxes, according to a report based on the documents that was published earlier this month. The data relate to accounts worth £650billion held by more than 100,000 people and legal entities around the world. What happened . A former HSBC employee-turned-whistleblower, Herve Falciani, gave the data to French tax authorities in 2008. France shared it with other governments and launched investigations. The French newspaper Le Monde obtained a version of the data and shared the material with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which analyzed the material together with The Guardian and the BBC. What the files show . The leaked documents mainly cover the years 2005 to 2007. HSBC, which is based in London but has operations globally, served those close to the regimes of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, former Tunisian leader Ben Ali and Syria's Bashar Assad. The consortium said clients include former and current politicians from Britain, Russia, Ukraine, Kenya, India, Mexico, Lebanon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zimbabwe, and Algeria. Switzerland had the greatest number of clients of the data examined, followed by France, the United Kingdom, Brazil and Italy. In terms of ranking by value, Switzerland was first with $31.2 billion, followed by the United Kingdom with $21.7 billion; Venezuela with $14.8 billion; the U.S. with $13.4 billion; and France with $12.5 billion. Why it matters . Though some of the details of such operations were disclosed previously, when HSBC was fined in 2012 by the U.S. for allowing criminals to use its branches for money laundering, the new information suggests HSBC took an active role in assisting the wealthy in hiding their money from authorities. 'The bank repeatedly reassured clients that it would not disclose details of accounts to national authorities, even if evidence suggested that the accounts were undeclared to tax authorities in the client's home country,' the consortium said. 'Bank employees also discussed with clients a range of measures that would ultimately allow clients to avoid paying taxes in their home countries.' Crawford Spence, a professor of accounting at the University of Warwick, said this case was different than other recent tax scandals. 'HSBC has been complicit in clear tax evasion and law breaking rather than legitimate tax avoidance,' he said. Potential fallout . The disclosures could see governments step up their efforts to prosecute tax evaders and the bank itself. Governments are looking to crack down on tax evasion to bolster their coffers depleted by the financial crisis and amid criticism that the rich aren't paying their fair share. In Britain, the report sparked criticism of tax authorities. The national tax agency clawed back £135million ($236 million) from some of the 3,600 Britons identified as using the Geneva branch of HSBC, but only one person has been prosecuted. France, by contrast, launched 103 legal actions. 'You are left wondering, as you see the enormity of what has been going on, what it actually takes to bring a tax cheat to court,' Margaret Hodge, chair of Parliament's Public Accounts Committee, told the BBC. Hodge said the former chairman of HSBC, Stephen Green, must face questions about whether he was 'asleep at the wheel, or he did know and he was therefore involved in dodgy tax practices.' In Belgium, an investigating judge is considering arrest warrants against some former and current officials of the HSBC bank if cooperation in an investigation on the Swiss operations does not improve. What HSBC says . HSBC stressed that the documents were from eight years ago and said it has since implemented initiatives designed to prevent its banking services from being used to evade taxes or launder money. Franco Morra, CEO of HSBC's Swiss subsidiary, said the new management had shut down accounts from clients who 'did not meet our high standards.' 'These disclosures about historical business practices are a reminder that the old business model of Swiss private banking is no longer acceptable,' he said in a statement. The investigation centers on prices for gold, silver, platinum and palladium. It is being carried out by the Justice Department with help from Commodity Futures Trading Commission . Barclays paid £290million in penalties to US and UK regulators in June 2012 to settle Libor rate-rigging claims. Libor, which stands for London Inter-Bank Offered Rate, is a benchmark that indicates the interest rate that banks charge when lending to each other and is seen as fundamental to the operation of both UK and world markets. Alleged rigging is said to have involved the submission of false figures in order either to make more money or to paint a false picture of a bank's health. A review in September 2012 found that the manipulation of the way it was fixed had damaged trust in the financial system. HSBC was one of several banks named in lawsuits filed in U.S. courts last year alleging a conspiracy to manipulate gold, silver, platinum and palladium prices, as well as precious metals derivatives, during the daily precious metals fixes. The century-old gold fix is a standard price for the metal that banks set twice a day over the phone. Some gold traders claim they were harmed by a scheme to manipulate the fix. The banks operating the precious metals benchmarks, known as the fixes, said last year they would no longer administer that process. An electronic daily silver price benchmark is now administered by Thomson Reuters and CME Group, while the London Metal Exchange provides twice-daily benchmark platinum and palladium prices. ICE Benchmark Administration will run an electronic gold price benchmark from March 20 to replace the London gold fix. Switzerland's financial watchdog said in November it had found a 'clear attempt' to manipulate precious metals price benchmarks. An investigation by German regulator Bafin found no signs of attempted benchmark price manipulation in precious metals, newspaper Handelsblatt reported last month. HSBC is currently under intense scrutiny over practices at its Swiss private bank, where it is said to have helped clients dodge taxes. It said past practices at this bank were 'unacceptable' as it reported that 2014 net income fell 16 percent to $13.7billion. HSBC acknowledged Monday that 2014 profits 'disappointed' and said the figures included the costs of paying settlements to cover past failings. These include $550million the bank set aside last year to cover penalties for manipulating foreign currency markets.","Investigation centers on prices for gold, silver, platinum and palladium .

"A Philadelphia man has been arrested in the stabbings of two members of rapper Nicki Minaj's tour, one of whom died. Authorities say 31-year-old Pierce Boykin was arrested Monday on charges of attempted murder, aggravated assault and related offenses. Police Capt James Clark said more arrests could come. Last week, authorities said they were looking for two suspects. The double stabbing on Wednesday left 29-year-old Devon Pickett dead and a second member of Minaj's tour, 27-year-old Eric Parker, severely wounded. Scroll down for video . Collared: Police in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania arrested Pierce Boykin, left, on Monday in connection to a deadly bar stabbing that left one of Nicki Minaj's tour managers dead and another in critical condition. Minaj pictured on the right attending a Marc Jacobs fashion show on February 19 in New York . Victims: De'Von Pickett (left), Nicki Minaj's tour manager, was stabbed to death last week, while Eric Parker (right), 27, remains in critical condition . Police sources told Philly.com that Boykin critically injured Parker, and that Pickett was killed by another assailant in the same fight. Police say the stabbing occurred outside a bar after the victims argued with a man inside, allegedly over a woman. According to Minaj, the crew members had arrived in Philadelphia only two days earlier to rehearse for a tour. Boykin or an attorney for him could not be reached Tuesday to comment on the charges. Minaj shared the news of the fatal bar fight on Twitter last week, writing; 'Two members of my team were stabbed last night in Philly. One was killed. They had only been there for two days rehearsing for the tour.' She also called the incident 'another senseless act of violence that took the life of a great guy.' Parker is expected to survive the incident. Scene: It has now been revealed that Pickett and Parker were fighting with the rival group over a female bartender who works at Che Bar & Grill, near where the altercation happened . It has now been revealed that the fight was over a female bartender who worked at the restaurant where Pickett, Parker and friends dined Tuesday night. When they were leaving Che Bar & Grill early the next morning, Minaj's employees got in a confrontation with a group of local men on the sidewalk outside. It's alleged that both Parker and a man from the rival group were both dating the female bartender. 'Both of the parties  knew a female who worked at the bar, and the arguments centered around her,' Capt Clark told WPVI. When she came out, Parker's group tried to escort her to the car. The situation escalated when Parker asked the woman if she was ok and someone in the other group pulled out a knife. Music veteran: Pickett (above) had worked in the music industry for years, helping out on tours for Rihanna and singer K. Michelle . Both men were in town to rehearse for Minaj's European tour, which begins next month in support of her new album The Pinkprint. Rihanna also paid tribute to Pickett, who previously worked on her tour, writing; 'Can't believe this is true! one of the nicest, coolest, funniest people I've ever met and toured with! We had so much fun together!!! Sad to lose a beautiful spirit like yours#RIPDayDay.' Rapper Fabolous also paid tribute, writing; 'My heart is heavy right now... God opened my eyes this morning at 9:49am. For some reason at that time I woke up thinking about both of these guys. They both work with me, but I couldn't figure out why they were in my mind at 1st wake up. Wasn't sure if I had a dream & they were in it or just some wake up & process things type shit.. But at 10:04 my brother hit me & told me... 'My friend died & my friend Eric Parker is in critical condition in the hospital fighting for his life. I am still in shock & don't want to believe this. And it hurts even more knowing how good these two dudes are. How hard these guys work. And how loyal they are to whoever they are down with & each other. Please send Eric Parker your blessings & a prayer for him to pull thru. Survivor: Parker (above with Questlove of The Roots) is in critical condition but expected to survive. It's believed that Boykin is the man who stabbed him . Friends with Bad Gal RiRi: Pickett worked on Rihanna's Glow In the Dark Tour (both pictured above) Tour manager to the music stars: Pickett also worked with K. Michelle (both above) on her first tour . 'And RIP to the fallen soldier Day Day. I can't even believe I'm saying that with your name attached to it. & I HATE this being a post!! I will miss your energy, your vibe, & you but I'll hold on to your spirit!! ' Singer K. Michelle wrote; 'I'm in real shock. Woke up this morning to some awful news that you passed. My heart is broken. You managed my first tour ever the Rebellious Soul Tour. 'You Were so supportive and excited about the growth of my career. When are we going to stop killing eachother? They don't even know they took away one of the best. You've guided so many careers. The road for many artist won't be the same. My heart hurts. Praying for your family and I know you are in a better place.' Pusha T also remembered Pickett; 'It's killing me to talk abt you in the past tense. I don't believe I've ever met someone as selfless as you. No one as humble and for the team as you. I hired you as my road manager simply because I knew you were more honest than me. 'There were stronger, more experienced, more polished candidates for the job but they weren't better than you. You made me see good in people. You gave everyone a chance, they should've gave you a chance. You didn't deserve this. Love you.'","Pierce Boykin, 31, was arrested Monday and charged with attempted murder, aggravated assault and other offenses .

"The FTSE 100 soared to a record high today as Britain's economic growth was given a 'pat on the back' by a leading international think-tank. The index of leading companies trading on the London Stock Exchange closed at 6,949.6, beating its previous life-time high set on December 30, 1999 at the height of the dot-com boom. It is a major boost for Chancellor George Osborne who was today lauded by the OECD for his 'remarkable' stewardship of the economy. The FTSE 100 Index has risen to a record high, its previous life-time high set on December 30, 1999 . Today's rally on the stock market means the FTSE 100 is now 13 percent higher since hitting a low in December and has risen by almost 6 per cent in 2015. Stocks rose in part after the European Central Bank agreed a 1.1 trillion euro (£820 billion) stimulus scheme to buy bonds, or parcels of government and corporate debt. Bank of England governor Mark Carney also revealed today that record low inflation means interest rates could be cut even further to near zero, in a boost for homeowners. OECD chief Angel Gurria, on a visit to London, even echoed a Tory slogan by hailing the Government's 'long term economic plan'. But he also warned that UK plc's recovery would be in jeopardy unless productivity improved - and highlighted the continuing threat from high property prices. Launching the OECD's latest survey of the British economy, Mr Gurria noted that 2.6 per cent growth last year was the highest in the G7. The organisation expects the rate to be the same this year. Chancellor George Osborne has been buoyed by a string of positive economic news, including a 'pat on the back' from the OECD . Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said interest could be cut below 0.5 per cent - but it was still more likely that they would rise . Interest rates could be cut even further from their already record low of just 0.5 per cent, the Bank of England Governor Mark Carney revealed this morning. The Bank chief said the banking system could cope with interest rates being cut closer to zero – but refused to say how far they could fall. However, Mr Carney insisted it was still more likely that rates would go up after inflation returns to normal after a period of falling prices this year. Mr Carney said that three-quarters of the current weakness in inflation was due to falling prices of oil and food, which he said was a 'temporary, one-off development'. He stressed that if there was any evidence of a sustained fall in inflation, the Bank could 'if necessary' cut interest rates from their current 0.5 per cent low to zero, but he emphasised that the 'focus of policy is towards tightening'. He said: 'Because of the resilience of banking and building societies has increased, we are in a position where we could, if necessary, cut bank rates towards zero. That is – to a level that is still above zero – but we haven't specified a specific level.' Mr Gurria said the performance of the labour market had been 'remarkable', with three million jobs created over the past five years. Relative to the size of the UK population, the figures were even better than those recorded in the US over the period, he said. 'Even as unemployment has fallen, inflationary pressures have vanished ... real wages are on the rise,' Mr Gurria told a press conference in the Treasury. 'We are predicting this economic expansion will continue this year and next. What a difference effective economic policies can make.' The fall in the oil price combined with fears over Greece had pulled markets lower at the start of 2015 but ECB stimulus and tentative hopes of a new deal on Greece's debts have, together with a slight bounce-back for oil, helped them recover. It comes after the FTSE 100 ended 2014 lower than it started in the first annual fall since 2011, leaving investors hoping for a better performance this year. Tom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity Personal Investing, said that UK shares had underperformed relative to Wall Street in the last couple of years, leaving them relatively cheap. Equities had been held back by falling commodity prices and anxiety over the Scottish referendum, meaning the market now offers better valuations for those hunting dividends, he said. Added to the likelihood of interest rates remaining low until the end of the year, it produced a 'positive combination' for investors. Mr Osborne seized on the praise from the OECD, including the Tories' election slogan about having a 'long term economic plan'. The Chancellor wrote on Twitter: 'The OECD report shows we have right strategy & Sec Gen Gurria says 'Britain has a long term economic plan & we need to stick to it' - I agree.' Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: 'This report confirms that the UK economy is returning to health and highlights the vital role of key Liberal Democrat policies in the turnaround. 'Our dramatic increases in the personal allowance, the greening of the economy, the focus on infrastructure, and putting the financial sector back on an even keel are just a few examples of where Liberal Democrat thinking has been central to the economic turnaround. 'Our commitment to continue the same balanced approach in the next parliament is in stark contrast to the Conservatives, who are abandoning fairness and the centre ground. 'By urging years of cuts for cuts' sake, by unfairly finishing the job of balancing the books on the backs of the least well-off and undermining our position in Europe, they will put this hard-won recovery at risk.' Shadow chief secretary to the treasury Chris Leslie said: 'The OECD is right to highlight the challenge of increasing productivity in order to sustainably raise living standards and so get the deficit down. 'This is what Labour's better plan for Britain's prosperity, which we published this month, is all about. Our plan includes cutting business rates for small firms, reforming the banking sector, investing in training and apprenticeships and keeping Britain in a reformed EU. 'Government standing back and hoping wealth will trickle-down from the top to everyone else simply won't work. We need a recovery that reaches kitchen tables across Britain, not one which has left working people £1,600 a year worse off since 2010.'","Index breaks record set in December 1999 at the height of dot-com boom .

But this is Phillip Lemonheigh being pushed into court in a wheelchair – then getting up and going for a stroll when he thought no one was looking.

The jobless stepson added: ‘You should have seen how slow he was walking. 'As long as he takes it easy he is OK, otherwise he gets tired so easily.’ The court heard how Lemonheigh, who did not have a driving licence, stuck ‘emergency response’ signs on his wife Noreen’s Renault Laguna.

"British troops are being sent to Ukraine to help the country defend itself against Russia, David Cameron announced today. About 75 soldiers will be deployed to carry out tactical intelligence and some basic 'defensive' infantry training. The revelation came as the Prime Minister warned there would be 'dreadful' consequences to appeasing Vladimir Putin. In a clear reference to the Second World War, Mr Cameron said Britain had 'made these mistakes' before, adding: 'It's not a sensible thing to do.' Mr Cameron said the Russian President's goal was to swallow up swathes of territory on its border. He told MPs that if Britain and the West did not stand up to Russia now, Mr Putin would target other countries after annexing parts of Ukraine. About 75 British soldiers will be sent to Ukraine to carry out tactical intelligence and some basic 'defensive' infantry training, the PM said today . Mr Cameron confirmed the British military personnel being sent to Ukraine will be deployed  over the next few weeks. Giving evidence to the Commons Liaison Committee, Mr Cameron said: 'We are not at the stage of supplying lethal equipment. We have announced a whole series of non-lethal equipment, night-vision goggles, body armour, which we have already said that we will give to Ukraine. 'Over the course of the next month we are going to be deploying British service personnel to provide advice and a range of training, from tactical intelligence to logistics to medical care, which is something else they have asked for. 'We will also be developing an infantry training programme with Ukraine to improve the durability of their forces. This will involve a number of British service personnel, they will be away from the area of conflict but I think this is the sort of thing we should be helping with.' The Prime Minister said he was not advocating sending 'large numbers of British troops' to Ukraine. But he said the EU and US should use its economic might to punish Mr Putin. Mr Cameron said: 'Of course there is short-term pain when you are putting sanctions on a country there's short term pain to your own economies. 'But in the medium to long term the countries of Europe depend on a rules-based system where people obey the rules. 'The instability we will yield if we don't stand up to Russia in the long-term will be deeply damaging to all of us, because you will see further destabilisation – next it will be Moldova or one of the Baltic States. 'That sort of instability and uncertainty will be dreadful for our economies, dreadful for our stability – and that's why Britain takes such a clear view.' Mr Cameron said the Russian President Vladimir Putin's goal to swallow up swathes of territory was becoming increasingly clear . Pro-Russian Donetsk residents receive a free meal during a rally as people celebrate the Russian festival 'Defender of the Fatherland'  in Donetsk, Ukraine, yesterday . He said Mr Putin's 'strategic goals' were becoming clear. 'We've now seen a very clear pattern of behaviour. We saw it Georgia, with the creation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, we've seen it with Transnistria – we're now seeing it with Ukraine. 'He would like if countries respond weekly to try to restore some of the Russian near abroad to Russia. That is what he would like to do in my view. That is not acceptable. These countries are democracies and should be able to decide their future.' Mr Cameron said allowing Russia to swallow up its smaller neighbours with Russian-speaking minorities would be wrong. He said: 'We've made these mistakes in our history, or talking about far-away countries of which we know little – and it's not a sensible thing to do. 'I'm not saying we should send huge numbers of British troops to Ukraine or even that we're at the stage of arming the Ukrainians – but what we should do is make the weight of our economic power that Europe and America play against Russia if they continue to behave in this way. 'Putin knows if he continues down this path he will have a very different relationship with Europe, with Britain, with the US, with the West.' Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko has asked for military help to defeat Russia's military advance, David Cameron said today . Members of the Ukrainian armed forces ride an armoured personnel carrier in Artemivsk, eastern Ukraine, today . Mr Cameron also insisted that Russia's annexation of Crimea and supporting Ukrainian rebels had not been a success for Moscow. He said: 'Let us not talk ourselves into some idea that it's all been a fantastic success for Russia – it hasn't been. 'A couple of Russian planes fly around the Channel. But we shouldn't talk ourselves into a situation where we think we can't defend ourselves – we absolutely can. The Prime Minister also insisted that Russia knew Britain and other members of Nato were 'rock solid' in support of its eastern European members. He said: 'President Putin absolutely knows that we would stand by our article five obligations. If a country of Nato is attacked, an attack on one is an attack on all. That is Nato doctrine – I sign up to it absolutely.' Mr Cameron said Britain was keeping up the pressure on Mr Putin from within the European Union. He said: 'Britain's role is to be at the tougher end of the spectrum, keeping the European Union and the European Union together.' By James Slack . Vladimir Putin attended a wreath-laying ceremony to mark the 'Day of the Fatherland's Defender' in Moscow yesterday . Ministers have been accused of kowtowing to Russia by refusing to publicly identify Vlaidimir Putin ‘henchmen’ with links to the UK. Despite a series of provocative acts by the Russians – including buzzing Bear bomber jets off the coast of Cornwall last week – the Home Office said it did not want to upset ‘international relations’. The decision provoked fury among MPs and campaigners who accused the Government of being on bended knee to the Russian lobby of ‘murderers and torturers’. Senior MPs say that, where a decision is taken to ban Russian officials from travelling to the UK on the grounds their presence here would be harmful, they should be publicly identified. This is considered crucial as, by omission, it would also reveal which of the President’s wealthy associates – including men with links to a notorious murders and the mafia – have not been excluded. There are fears a string of Russians who may even pose a threat to national security are still being allowed in, to avoid angering Putin. Tory Dominic Raab warned: ‘If we are serious about trying to alter Putin’s behaviour, should we not start by making sure that those who bankroll him cannot enjoy the fruits of their labour here, clandestinely in luxurious comfort? ‘Those individuals who bankroll Putin and his like should know that when they cross the line and engage in serious international crimes, their association with him and support for him will bar their ability to enjoy the luxurious Knightsbridge lifestyle that so many of them crave. ‘People carrying dirty money and individuals with blood on their hands should not be welcome on the streets of Britain. This is not just a question of moral principle. ‘Sooner or later, if we keep allowing such unsavoury characters into the UK, bringing all their baggage and vendettas with them, we risk finding that it is British citizens who are caught in the crossfire or worse.’ The campaign to name Putin associates banned from Britain was inspired by Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who was tortured and murdered in 2009 whilst detained, on instructions from the Kremlin, for exposing a $230 million tax fraud committed by Putin’s ‘cronies’. In the US, a law was introduced banning the Russian officials allegedly involved in the killing from entering the country. All have been publicly named by the Obama administration. MPs have been calling for a similar law in the UK since 2012. Yet, while promising to similarly exclude the guilty men, the Home Office refuses to say who has been banned – raising fears a number of those responsible have been allowed to slip through the net to avoid offending Putin. Tory MP Dominic Raab has accused of kowtowing to Russia by refusing to publicly identify Vladimir Putin ‘henchmen’ with links to the UK . On Monday evening, a band of senior MPs – including the chairmen of seven Westminster select committees - attempted to introduce a clause to the Serious Crime Bill. This would have forced the Government to identify the people who it had excluded from the country and, therefore, those who remain free to travel here. However, despite the continued Russian hostility to Britain, Home Office Minister Karen Bradley was ordered to block the legislation in order to not offend ‘international relations and foreign policy objectives’. A string of prominent Tory backbenchers had backed the naming of Putin’s ‘henchmen’, including ex-solicitor General Sir Edward Garnier, who said the case for changing the law was ‘unassailable’. Mr Raab accused the Home Office officials blocking the legislation of burying their heads in ‘a comfortable secrecy and lack of transparency’. The Government’s ‘unbelievable’ stance also angered campaigners. The British businessman Bill Browder, who employed Mr Magnitsky, said: ‘Who are British ministers serving here? They are more worried about a dictator in a foreign country than in keeping the British people safe. ‘The Russian torturers and murderers lobby seems to hold a lot more sway here in the UK than the US.’ Justifying the decision, Mrs Bradley said changing the law would have ‘serious implications for the security of our borders and therefore to the national security of the country’. She added: ‘There is a further risk that publication of individuals excluded from the UK may undermine international relations and foreign policy objectives. ‘That risk is intensified if the excluded individual has connections with a foreign Government or well known organisation that may be working in partnership with the UK to broaden our interests abroad. That is one example. ‘Also, ongoing investigations into the activities of an individual could be jeopardised if they became aware of the fact that they were on the list.’","About 75 soldiers will be deployed to carry out  'defensive' infantry training .

"Just weeks after a Brisbane stadium banned the use of selfie sticks at a One Direction concert, the promoter of a national festival has followed suite. Branding them as narcassistic, Soundwave festival promoter AJ Maddah took to Twitter this week to express his outrage over the accessories, leading to a ban which revellers have embraced with open arms. 'Dear people with those f***ing camera sticks: please have some consideration for people behind you trying to enjoy the show. Thank you,' Maddah wrote on Sunday. Selfie sticks have been banned at the upcoming legs of the Soundwave festival . The festival's promoter took to Twitter last week to express his hatred for the contraptions . He has now warned fans they will have selfie sticks and tablets confiscated at the gates and put in a cloak room if they try to bring them in . After support from fans and festival goers calling for him to ban them, the promoter told his followers to 'consider it done'. Maddah also warned patrons if they tried to bring tablets into the upcoming legs of Soundwave - which hits most Australian capital cities - they would be confiscated. 'No tablets allowed at #SW15 (Soundwave 2015)', he posted on Twitter. In a follow up interview with Fairfax, Maddah called the selfie sticks egotistic and said they get in the way of others having a good time at concerts. 'It is just the ultimate expression of narcissism,' he told the publication. After many fans took his side on Twitter about barring the devices he made it official . He said no one would be allowed to bring a tablet into a Soundwave festival 'ever again' Maddah has pointed out the danger but also inconvenience they are to other festival goers . The promoter said the final straw came when he saw someone taking a photo of themselves with a selfie stick instead of the band on stage . 'Most of them are pointed at the stage with kids taking photos. But I think the one that kind of put it in perspective for me was there was a band set going and a young girl pointed it at herself,' Maddah added. He said that was the final straw for him and said if she hadn't been a paying attendee he would have grabbed the stick off her and kicked her out. Maddah said there was no way he would allow selfie sticks or tablets into the Sydney leg of Soundwave this weekend, and would instead confiscate them and put them in a cloak room until after the festival. Maddah made sure to make his point clear on social media this week . Some other uses also pointed out the dangers of the selfie sticks being used as weapons . The promoter helped the ban would help fans simply go and have a good time watching the performances . The promoter said not only was he concerned about fans illegally recording bands' sets, they posed a danger and also an inconvenience for those there to see the performances. 'It is insane that people don't have enough courtesy to care about the people around them,' Maddah said. 'Just don't bring them,' he said, after seeing too many at the Adelaide and Melbourne legs of the festival. This comes just weeks after Suncorp Stadium banned fans from bringing their selfie sticks to One Direction concerts, much to the outrage of teenage girls across the state. Last week in a similar move Suncorp Stadium banned One Direction fans from taking selfie sticks to the concert . The restriction was listed under Suncorp Stadium's One Direction Frequently Asked Questions section. 'For the safety and comfort of other patrons, selfie sticks are not permitted into the stadium for this event,' the stadium's website said. Other restricted items included alcohol, pepper spray or mace, fireworks, studded jewellery, spurs and unusually long wallet chains.","Soundwave promoter AJ Maddah has banned selfie sticks from the festival .

"New Zealand skiing holidays and Kiwi wines are set to get more expensive with economists predicting the Australian dollar will fall to parity with the New Zealand dollar . ANZ economist Daniel Been said the Aussie and Kiwi dollar will likely reach parity for the first time since both currencies were floated, after the AUD hit a record low 103.01 Kiwi cents last Thursday. 'At the moment momentum suggests that parity is more likely than not,' Mr Been said . New Zealand skiing holidays (such as in Queenstown, pictured) are set to get more expensive with economists predicting the Australian dollar will fall to parity with the New Zealand dollar within 12 months . Settled snow is seen covering houses on New Zealand's lower South Island  in Queenstown . 'It's very difficult to see what structures will change that will prompt a change - a catalyst for a sharp reversal is not all that obvious.' Mr Been co-authored a report about the AUD/NZD with fellow ANZ economist Sam Tuck. Mr Tuck said the two currencies would probably hit parity in the next year, with the options market suggesting there is a 57 per cent it will happen. He said this would make New Zealand products more expensive for Australian consumers. 'Australians who like to come over to Queenstown of Christchurch for a skiing holiday in winter, it will make that more expensive and make the Snowy Mountains more attractive,' Mr Tuck said. New Zealand wines would also become more pricey if the AUD and NZD hit parity . A tractor mulches dead wood  at one of winemaker Villa Maria Estate Ltd.'s vineyards in Marlborough, NZ . 'Those who enjoy Kiwi wines will have to pay a bit more for it.' Mr Been said parity would not have a big impact on the Australian economy, and parity would be 'unlikely to sustain itself for a long period of time'. 'For the Australian economy I don't think the consequences are as large as they are for the New Zealand economy,' he said. 'New Zealand makes up about 4 per cent of our exports basket, but we make up about 20 per cent of the export market for NZ.' In their report, Mr Been and Mr Tuck said decline in the AUD will add competitiveness pressures on the New Zealand economy. 'A sustained push through parity would make holidaying in destinations like Queensland or Tasmania far more attractive on a relative basis,' they wrote. The Australian dollar hit a record low of 103.01 Kiwi cents last Thursday . The report said the move toward parity was due largely to the fact that the New Zealand economy had confidence whereas the Australian economy did not . The report said the move toward parity was due largely to the fact that the New Zealand economy had confidence whereas the Australian economy did not. New Zealand is enjoying growth beyond the housing sector, but in Australia 'the malaise is going to be hard to shake in the near term', the report said. 'In May last year, as the new government's first budget was delivered it provided a watershed moment,' Mr Been and Mr Tuck wrote. 'It hammered home the consequences of the declines in the terms of trade and that Australia's incomes in aggregate were unlikely to rise. 'This means that the momentum in Australia is going to be hard to shift and the RBA will likely have an easing bias for much of 2015.'","Experts say the Aussie and Kiwi dollar will likely reach parity for first time .

"A businessman who paid Eastern European workers just £30-a-day to pick crops in the fields charged them £30-a-week to sleep on mattresses on the derelict ground floor of a former pub, a court has heard. Mohammed Aslam, 71, lived in the upstairs area of the The Smut Inn in Oldham, Greater Manchester, and he had converted it into a modern living area with high standards. But Oldham Magistrates' Court heard that the ground floor, where up to ten men slept on mattresses, was squalid and did not have any heating. Mohammed Aslam charged each of his workers £30-a-week to live on a mattress in the former pub, pictured . Council officials believe that up to ten men slept on the ground floor of the pub without heating . Mr Aslam lived on the first floor of the building, pictured,  which had been renovated to a high standard . The men were also expected to wash in the former pub's toilets, while a fire escape had been jammed closed with a paint roller, meaning it could not be opened easily in the case of an emergency. Oldham Council said the men living at the property told investigators that they were being paid £30 per day to pick coriander in the fields of North Wales and East Yorkshire. But they were also made to pay £30 per week for their squalid accommodation. There was no heating and the lighting could only be controlled from one switch behind the old bar. Photographs from inside the property were taken by Oldham Council who prosecuted the property's owner Mohammed Aslam, 71. They showed that many of the pub's windows are boarded up. But despite the poor conditions downstairs the council found that Aslam lived on the first floor of the property which had recently been renovated to a high standard . Last year Environmental Health Officers were informed by the police that the men were staying on the ground floor of the property. Aslam paid his tenants £30-a-day to work in fields picking crops of coriander across Wales and Yorkshire . The ground floor of the building, which used to be The Smut Inn, did not have any proper washing facilities . The ground floor area which used to be the bar had been partitioned into separate 'bedrooms', pictured, . Officers arranged with Greater Manchester Police and Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service to visit the premises just after midnight on July 1, last year. The owner Aslam had just arrived back from work with the men who were all working for him. When officers went into the property they found the bar still in situ but the seating area had been poorly partitioned off to make bedrooms. A prohibition order was served at the time of the visit stating that an interlinked fire detection system was to be installed or the workers were not allowed to stay there. A follow up visit carried out by officers on September 10, last year revealed that the prohibition order hadn't been complied with and there was still workers living there. Legal proceedings were then launched by the council. At Oldham Magistrates Court Aslam pleaded guilty to 11 offences under the Housing Act 2004 of Management of Houses in Multiple Occupation (England) Regulations 2006. He was fined £2,200 with £2,600 costs. Councillor Dave Hibbert, Cabinet Member for Housing, Planning and Transport, said: 'In this day and age it is shocking that a landlord would allow their tenants to live in such a poorly maintained property. 'The council gave Aslam an opportunity to put the faults right in his property but he failed to do so. 'All landlords have a responsibility to their tenants and must ensure that the properties they rent out are safe and healthy to live in. We will take action against those who think they can get away with letting out substandard properties. 'Oldham Council is committed to working with landlords for the benefit of all the Borough's residents.'

"Alleged terrorism plotter Omarjan Azari was urged to 'pick a random unbeliever' and kill him or her, and then film the body next to an ISIS flag, a court has heard. Azari, 22, was denied bail on Tuesday after Sydney's Central Local Court was read extracts of a conversation between him and Islamic State member Mohammad Baryalei, during which it's alleged they discussed a plot to kill random members of the public. 'Just pick a random unbeliever,' Baryalei is alleged to have said. 'What you guys need to do is pick any unbeliever. 'Finish him, finish her, put the flag of the state in the background.' Scroll down for video . Push: A supporter of Omarjan Azari is pictured pushing a news photographer into a parked car as he leaves Central Local Court today . Azari was arrested at his Guildford home in Sydney's west in mid-September during the biggest counter-terrorism operation in Australia's history . Hidden: A supporter of Omarjan Azari attempts to shield his identity from the waiting media . Azari was refused bail and remains in custody after prosecutors revealed parts of a transcript where the suspect was allegedly ordered to conduct a beheading plot. His supporters are pictured pushing a photographer . Kingpin: Baryalei, pictured above, allegedly ordered Azari to behead a 'random unbeliever' The court heard he Azari instructed to also choose American, French or British backpackers as 'that would be better'. The crown alleged Azari is heard to say 'yeah' in agreement multiple times. 'It's evidence of an agreement ... and the particular manner agreed,' crown prosecutor Peter Neil, SC, said. He said there was strong evidence either Azari by himself, or with others, was planning to randomly pick someone and 'kill them, cover them with the Islamic State flag, film it and send it to Mr Baryalei'. In denying bail, Magistrate John Andrews said he was not satisfied the extraordinary circumstances needed to grant Azari's release existed, and described the prosecution case as strong. Azari appeared via video link from Goulburn's supermax prison. Outside the court, supporters of Azari clashed with media, resulting in a brief scuffle with two cameramen. Earlier, Azari's defence lawyer accused Prime Minister Tony Abbott of prejudicing the case against his client. Barrister Steven Boland said Mr Abbott's public statements about the case were an 'unprecedented intrusion by a sitting PM into criminal proceedings'. Departure: More supporters pour out of Central Local Court in Sydney . Hats down: Omarjan Azari remains remanded in custody . Mr Boland said Mr Abbott spread misinformation about the case. 'Mr Abbott has deliberately or otherwise spread misinformation that has no support in the evidence,' he said. '(It) gives rise to a substantial possibility that Mr Azari's interests have been harmed by the power of Mr Abbott's statement. 'The people of Australia have been told that there's a plot to behead people. It was made up.' Azari was arrested at his Guildford home in Sydney's west in mid-September during the biggest counter-terrorism operation in Australia's history. Since those raids, Mr Abbott has stepped up his rhetoric on national security. Mr Boland said the allegation of plotting an attack was untrue and argued Azari's custody conditions at Goulburn's supermax prison were excessively onerous for someone with no criminal conviction. Azari is facing three other terrorist financing charges. The matter is next expected back in court on April 29.","Terror suspect Omarjan Azari was refused bail today .

"Companies behind nuisance calls and texts will be fined up to £500,000 under a crackdown on firms which plague millions of families. Ministers will announce today that they will change the law to making it much easier to levy tough penalties on those responsible for the menace, MailOnline has learned. The communications watchdog will no longer have to prove messages are causing a 'substantial damage or substantial distress' before taking action against those responsible, including holding bosses personally liable for fines. Ministers will announce tomorrow that they will change the law to making it much easier to levy tough penalties on those responsible for the menace . Last year there were more than 175,000 complaints made to the Information Commissioner's Office about nuisance calls and texts. Four in five people are regularly cold-called at home, according to consumer group Which?, while a third of people feel intimidated by the messages. Spam text messaging is also on the increase, particularly communications about debt or accident claims. Industry figures show there are one billion unwanted phone and text messages a year. Some firms are believed to have illegally obtained mobile and landline numbers. Others are operating outright scams. Culture Secretary Sajid Javid vowed to act after seeing evidence that so many people were suffering cold calls that six in ten people said they no longer want to answer their own phone. A consultation was launched in October last year on lowering the threshold for legal action. It is understood that ministers will announce tomorrow that they will go ahead with the change, to make it easier to take action against firms behind nuisance calls. Legislation is expected to be amended shortly with the change coming into effect before the general election. A government source told MailOnline said: 'Companies have bombarded people with unwanted marketing calls and texts, but have escaped punishment because they did not cause enough harm. 'So we're making it easier for companies to face the consequences of ignoring the law and subjecting us to calls or texts we have said we don't want.' The ICO had levied a fine of £300,000 against the co-owner of a marketing company, Tetrus Telecoms, which sent hundreds of thousands of texts about PPI and accident claims. Culture Secretary Sajid Javid vowed to act after seeing evidence that so many people were suffering cold calls that six in ten people said they no longer want to answer their own phone . But a tribunal upheld Christopher Niebel's appeal that the messages did not meet the legal test to prove 'substantial harm or distress' had been caused. Ed Vaizey, Tory digital minister, said: 'For far too long companies have bombarded people with unwanted marketing calls and texts and escaped punishment because they did not cause enough harm. 'This change will make it easier for the Information Commissioner's Office to take action against offenders and send a clear message to others that harassing consumers with nuisance calls or texts is just not on. 'We're also going to look at whether the powers the ICO have to hold to account board level executives are sufficient.' According to new research from alldayPA, which handles calls for 23,000 small businesses, some companies are being targeted with as many as 30 cold calls a day. David Joseph, board executive at alldayPA said: 'The number of cold-callers targeting businesses is out of control and has become a real drain on the time and resources especially for smaller companies and home businesses.' Earlier this month Information Commissioner Christopher Graham demanded more powers to rein in firms that bombard pensioners and Alzheimer's sufferers with nuisance text messages and cold calls.. He urged ministers to change the law to make it easier to clamp down on unwanted calls and spam texts by companies promising to write off debts, pursue compensation and sell anything from mobile phones to double glazing. Mr Graham said: 'The current rules around marketing calls are a licence for spammers and scammers. 'The elderly and vulnerable are particularly at risk, and this can only add to the worries of those who care for them. The Government is letting people down. 'Time and time again the Government talks about changing the law and clamping down on this problem, but so far it's just that – talk. We seem to be going round in circles. The Government need to lay the order, change the law and bring in a reform that would make a real difference.' Ministers insist they are determined to tackle the problem of nuisance calls. Rules on data sharing were changed last year to make it easier for Ofcom to give information to the ICO on companies breaking the law. The ICO has powers to take action against companies who break the existing rules on direct marketing. Since January 2012, the watchdog has taken enforcement action against nine companies for nuisance calls and text messages, hitting them with fines totalling £815,000. The ICO states: 'We meet with companies to discuss their compliance with the law and monitor their progress. And we now have the power to fine those who break the law.' Separately, Ofcom has powers to deal with abandoned and silent calls by taking action against offenders that persistently misuse a network or service resulting in annoyance, inconvenience or anxiety. To date Ofcom has fined seven companies totalling £1,926,500 for abandoned and silent calls. Mr Javid said in October: 'Companies have bombarded people with unwanted marketing calls and texts, but have escaped punishment because they did not cause enough harm,' the Culture Secretary said. 'Being called day after day may not be 'substantially distressing', but that doesn't make it acceptable. 'I want to make it easier for companies to face the consequences of ignoring the law and subjecting us to calls or texts we have said we don't want.' Consumer group Which? welcomed the announcement today. Executive director Richard Lloyd, who chaired the Nuisance Calls Task Force, said: 'These calls are an everyday menace blighting the lives of millions so we want the regulator to send a clear message by using their new powers to full effect without delay. 'It's also good news that the Government has listened to our call and is looking into how senior executives can be held to account if their company makes nuisance calls. 'The regulator can now go after the worst offenders for flouting cold-calling rules: just one more nuisance call could see those companies facing a big fine.' Two companies that appeared in the BBC TV series The Call Centre, starring eccentric boss Neville Wilshire, were fined £225,000 for nuisance payment protection insurance calls in 2013. Separately, communications regulator Ofcom has the power to deal with silent calls by taking action against firms that persistently misuse a network or service resulting in 'annoyance, inconvenience or anxiety'. To date, it has fined seven companies a combined £1,618,000. However, watchdogs have complained the law as it stands makes prosecutions and fines difficult. The ICO levied a fine of £300,000 against one firm but the decision was reversed on appeal as no substantial harm or distress had been shown. The watchdog warned the ruling had left it almost powerless to deter such companies even if they churn out industrial quantities of messages.","Ministers to announce tomorrow that it will be made easier to impose fines .

Across aisle sat Terri Hernandez, mother of the defendant, who returned to court after a number of days away. As proceedings began, a woman who cleaned Hernandez's Massachusetts home testified that the former Patriots star's fiancée was visibly nervous the day after Lloyd was killed. Hernandez's fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, spent time on the telephone, peeking out the window and crying after hauling away a large trash bag in the trunk of a red car, 31-year-old Carla Barbosa, a native of Brazil, told the court. Miss Jenkins was not in court on Tuesday. 'She was nervous, she was walking back and forth,' said Barbosa, who added that police were outside when she left the house on June 18, 2013, a day after Odin Lloyd's bullet-riddled body was found. Ex-Pats player, Aaron Hernandez, looks at a photograph of the body of Odin Lloyd, displayed as evidence in Hernandez's murder trial at Bristol County Superior Court in Fall River, Massachusetts . The jury was shown surveillance footage of Shayanna Jenkins, Aaron Hernandez's fiancée, leaving their home with a large trash bag on the day after Odin Lloyd's murder . The day after Lloyd's body was found on wasteland a mile from the Hernandez home, the football player's fiancée, Shayanna, was seen on their own surveillance cameras taking a large trash bag from the home . Earlier that day, Barbosa testified, she saw Jenkins carry a large trash bag out of the home. 'It was held close to her, she had her arms around it,' she said in Portuguese, which was translated by an interpreter. Jenkins has pleaded not guilty to perjury charges for lying to a grand jury about not knowing where she disposed of a box Hernandez had asked her to throw out. She was granted immunity recently but it remains unclear if she will testify. Prosecutors showed video from Hernandez's home surveillance system of Jenkins carrying a large trash bag from the house. Lloyd's body was found on June 17, 2013, in an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez's house. Lloyd, 27, had been shot six times, and police found five empty .45-caliber shell casings nearby. They found another 45-caliber shell in a dumpster at a rental car agency, and witnesses testified it had been removed from a car Hernandez returned. Police have not found the gun used in the slaying. Prosecutors contend Hernandez and two friends, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, picked up Lloyd at his Boston home, before driving him to the North Attleborough industrial area where his body was found. On Monday, two other housekeepers testified that they found several guns around Hernandez's home in the weeks before Lloyd's murder . Marilia Prinholato, 28, said that a black handgun fell onto the floor while she was changing sheets in a basement guestroom at the house where Hernandez lived with his fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, and their baby. 'I just took the gun and looked at it and put it back,' Prinholato said, adding that the gun was 12 to 16 inches (30 to 40 cm) long and had a full magazine. Prinholato said another housekeeper, Grazielli Andrade Silva, showed her a second, smaller gun that Silva found in a pocket of a pair of pants the former tight end left in the master bedroom. It was silver with black accents, she said. Hernandez's house cleaners, Grazielli Silva (left) and Marila Prinholato (right), testified during the murder trial on Monday about finding guns at the NFL star's Massachusetts mansion . Silva testified that the gun was small enough to fit in the palm of her hand, and that she saw another gun, like 'a normal gun that the police use,' in Hernandez's sock drawer. Lloyd's body was found by a teenaged jogger on June 17, 2013, in an industrial park about a mile  from Hernandez's home. Authorities have not located the gun used in the slaying. Hernandez, who has pleaded not guilty, had a $41 million contract with the New England Patriots when he was cut from the team shortly after being arrested in June 2013. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of life in prison. He will face a second trial later this year on charges he killed two Cape Verdean men outside a Boston nightclub in 2012. Earlier on Monday, two people who worked in the industrial park where Lloyd's body was found testified that they heard sounds like fireworks at the time of his death.","Victim Odin Lloyd's mother, Ursula Ward, cried as photos of his body were shown during Hernandez's murder trial in Fall River, Massachusetts .

"A former bank manager has pleaded guilty to systematically stealing over $1.4 million from two customers in suburban New York, including a 92-year-old ex-policeman. Bank manager: Maria Rodriguez of Mount Kisco has pleaded guilty to systematically stealing over $1.4 million from two customers in suburban New York . Maria Rodriguez of Mount Kisco entered guilty pleas Monday, Westchester County District Attorney Janet DiFiore said in a news release. 46-year-old Rodriguez was a branch manager for M&T Bank in Ossining. Rodgriuez pleaded guilty to one count of third-degree criminal tax fraud, as well as one count of first-degree grand larceny and one count of second-degree grand larceny, DiFiore said. The district attorney said in the release 'We entrust our money and investments to our financial institutions and their employees. Both victims put their trust as well as their money in the hands of someone who they had faith in, but ultimately took advantage of that trust and stole from them.' Several of Rodriguez's subordinates called the bank's whistleblower hotline. The bank contacted authorities. DiFiore said the thefts began in June 2008. The first victim 'trusted the defendant to assist her with her personal banking and banking for her business,' the news release said. 'Over the course of five years, the defendant stole money from the victim by writing unauthorized checks to cash, making unauthorized cash withdrawals, and requesting an ATM card and making unauthorized ATM withdrawals.' The first victim had $1,112,127.40 stolen from her, DiFiore said. The 92-year-old victim used to a be a police officer in Ossining Village, according to DiFiore, and reportedly lost $256,644. DiFiore said in the release that the man thought he was withdrawing interest alone from his bank account. Rodriguez was instead making unauthorized withdrawals, she said. Rodriguez faces up to 25 years in prison when she's sentenced on May 20.

"The temperatures in London still signal winter but Victoria Beckham is hailing the beginning of spring. The fashion designer has commissioned a new art installation for the front of her 36 Dover Street clothes store to signal the start of SS15 season. Last season, Victoria worked with Shirazeh Houshiary on a Christmas tree at the shop, this time she collaborated with acclaimed set designer Andy Hillman on a floral design. Scroll down for video . Victoria Beckham has installed a giant pink foxglove in her London shop that was designed by Andy Hillman. He also created vinyl foxglove pictures for the store's front window . The designer created a giant foxglove, complete with pollinating bees, to sit at the bottom of the main staircase in the store. The sculpture has been suspended from the ceiling to make it look like it is growing up from the stark concrete floor. Andy also designed a vinyl foxglove floral to cover the glass window at the front of the shop, which continues out onto the stairs that lead up to the door. Victoria's upside down Christmas tree installation created a mass of public attention when it was built at the store for the festive season. The foxglove installation is designed to coincide with the beginning of the SS15 fashion season . The large sculpture comes complete with giant fake pollinating bees . It was similar to the tree that Shirazeh Houshiary created for the Tate in 1993, which Victoria referenced when thinking of Christmas decorations for the store last autumn. Victoria, 40, opened her Dover Street boutique in September, the first standalone store for her high-fashion brand which has been winning critical acclaim since it launched in 2008. The store houses handbags, sunglasses and the Victoria Victoria Beckham collection on the ground level and her main collection upstairs. Victoria Beckham poses for the camera in her Dover Street store . In an exclusive tour of the Dover Street space back in September, the designer told MailOnline why she shunned traditional features such as a till and a window display in favour of a more contemporary space. ‘It’s the first time people can see the brand through my eyes,’ she said. ‘I didn’t want a traditional shop window, just a plain window, and a huge concrete sliding door.’ On the subject of tills, she added: ‘We’re not going to have any ugly tills anywhere. Payment is with an iPad, so we can go to the customer on whatever floor she’s on.’ Last season, Victoria worked with Shirazeh Houshiary on a Christmas tree at the shop .","Victoria Beckham has installed a giant pink foxglove in her London shop .

"'Bland': Amanda Redman, former star of New Tricks, criticised the programme when she left in 2013. It is now cancelled to make way for more BBC drama . It has already been criticised by its own cast for not being as good as it used to be. Now BBC1 has called time on detective drama New Tricks after 12 years on our screens. Bosses said they will axe the programme, which follows a squad of retired police officers recruited to investigate unsolved crimes, after its twelfth series this year to ‘increase the range of drama on the channel’. All of the original line-up – James Bolam, Amanda Redman, Alun Armstrong and Dennis Waterman – have already quit the show. Mr Bolam, 79, said it had ‘gone stale’ when he announced his departure in 2011. Miss Redman, 57, who left in 2013, said it was ‘bland’, adding: ‘The characters are not being as anarchic as they used to be, which I think is a huge shame.’ Launched in 2003, the light-hearted crime drama won legions of fans as long-suffering boss DSI Sandra Pullman, played by Redman, and her irreverent team of old-school policeman looked into unsolved crimes. Viewers were won over by the on-screen chemistry between Redman, James Bolam, 79, Alun Armstrong, 68, Dennis Waterman, 66. But, over the years, the ageing team gradually left to be replaced with the slightly younger alternatives of Denis Lawson, 67, Nicholas Lyndhurst, 53, and Tamzin Outhwaite, 44. Armstrong also complained about developments in the series, saying: ‘My character has got saner. Which I’m not too enamoured with.’ BBC bosses promised that the final series, featuring 10 new episodes, would go out on a high. Last September, Waterman became the last member of the original cast to announce he was leaving the show. The star – who also sings the theme tune – said it was because he missed ‘the old crew, the original line-up’. His spokesman said at the time: ‘The chemistry between [the original line up] on the set was remarkable.’ He added that there had been ‘no big falling out’ - simply that the old team had worked together for a long time. Waterman will only feature in two episodes of the final series, which began filming last November. Larry Lamb, 67, will replace him for the last episodes. The original crew: James Bolam, Dennis Waterman, Amanda Redman and Brian Lane in a publicity photo for the very first series of New Tricks, which was launched on BBC One in 2003 . In a joint statement, Charlotte Moore, Controller BBC One and Ben Stephenson, Controller BBC Drama said: ‘We are incredibly proud of New Tricks and would like to thank Roy Mitchell the brilliant creator, Wall to Wall and Headstrong, and all the cast and teams involved across the 12 series. ‘However, on BBC One it’s important to make room for new series and continue to increase the range of drama on the channel, so it won’t be returning after the next series airs this summer’ Fans of the show took to social media to express disappointment that New Tricks was over but also conceded that it was perhaps the right time to do so. Andrew White, from Doncaster, said: ‘It had run its course really, hadn’t it?’ Matthew Donovan, from Watford, tweeted: ‘So sad to hear this. I’ve been a huge fan since series one. Can we please have the odd special still? ‘ . Gaynor Rowse, from East Sussex, tweeted: ‘No what a shame, no doubt it will be replaced with rubbish. Really don’t know why I pay my TV licence.’","Cancellation comes after all the original line-up left the much-loved show .

"The company has agreed to rebrand its 'eco superstar' A major lightbulb producer has given way and agreed to stop branding old-fashioned products as ‘eco’ bulbs. The Daily Mail revealed last month that Osram and Philips, two of the biggest manufacturers of lightbulbs, were selling basic halogen bulbs with ‘eco’ branding. Consumer groups accused the firms of trying to ‘greenwash’ their products, encouraging people to buy them because they think they are more environmentally friendly and could save them money. But in reality halogen bulbs are among the least energy efficient bulbs widely available today. They have been surpassed by several technologies including LEDs and compact fluorescent (CFL) bulbs - some of which will burn ten times less energy. Now, just weeks after the Mail’s expose, Osram has agreed to rebrand its ‘Eco Superstar’ bulb as ‘Halogen Classic’. Christian Boelling, a spokesman for the Germany-based firm said: ‘We have decided not to use the term ‘Eco’ for our halogen products any more. ‘This change will be implemented in the course of an already planned packaging change. ‘The advantages of dedicated lamp types will still be communicated in the future. This includes longer lifetime, the possibility of disposal in household waste and better light quality. The adjustment will be implemented as soon as possible.’ Previously Osram had tried to insist that Eco stood for ‘economy’ as well as ‘ecology’ - reflecting the cheaper price of the halogen bulb. But the firm has now changed its stance. Mr Boelling said: ‘From our point of view, the term ‘Eco’ is not crucial for our customers. ‘For this reason we decided not to use it anymore.’ Philips, however, is continuing to sell its EcoClassic bulb. A spokesman said consumers are given enough information on packets to make an informed decision. The Energy Saving Trust estimates that replacing every halogen bulb with LEDs will save a family £40 a year in electricity bills. Philips EcoClassic bulb and Osram Classic Eco Superstar bulb each only earn an energy label grade of C or D, the third and fourth out of five efficiency bands. The Energy Saving Trust estimates that replacing every halogen bulb with LEDs will save a family £40 a year in electricity bills. They will last just 2000 hours and consume ten times more energy than the latest LED technology, researchers say. Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a think tank in London, said: ‘Low-energy lightbulbs are one of the success stories of recent years, saving British households about a billion pounds per year and helping to reduce the carbon emissions that are changing our climate. ‘So it’s great that Osram has seen sense and put consumers back in charge of their energy saving. We would urge other companies still using misleading labels to follow suit and help consumers make informed choices about their energy bills and carbon emissions.’","Daily Mail revealed companies were selling halogen bulbs with 'eco' labels .

"Terry Ditrich had her first car - a Corvette Stingray - stolen from the parking lot of her work six months after she bought it in Duluth, Georgia, in 1972. At the time police said the car was a likely stripped of its parts and dumped in the Chattahoochee River. But the cops recently called her saying it had been found, 42 years after it was taken from her. The only problem is that she no longer actually owns it. Finally found: This Corvette Stingray was stolen from its owner in 1972, but has now turned up, thanks to the smarts of a car restorer who recently bought it . Well-kept: The car is in exceptional condition, the only problem is that the original owner no longer owns it . Impounded: Owner Terry Dietrich now needs a court order to get her car back after 42 years . The new owner, car restorer Gary Green, bought it from a widow in North Carolina. Green checked the vehicle identification number (VIN) and realized it matched a 1969 Corvette convertible and thought something was amiss. He the realized there was another VIN stamped into the frame and engine. Green called police, who verified the car was stolen in November 1972. The car was impounded and Dietrich was told it had been found, all these years later. However, Dietrich had financed and insured the car through Allstate, who paid out the title when it was stolen. That gave Allstate legal ownership of the car. Now, neither Allstate nor the state of Georgia can provide a title to Dietrich. 'If I could get that car back, it could roll back up the same driveway, pull back into the same carport it left 11-14-72. How awesome is that?' Dietrich told 11 Alive. Great condition: The car was looked after very well by its former owner . Slick: Interestingly, owner Terry Dietrich lives in the same place she did when the car was stolen . Reunion: Dietrich hopes the car will finally be returned to her after all this time . Flashback: This is a photo of Terry Dietrich taken around the time the car was stolen in 1972 . Dietrich now needs a court order in order to get the car released to her. However she says she can't afford to get one. Without a court order the car will stay impounded and eventually be auctioned off. 'If I cannot have the car back, I do not want to see it,' Dietrich told 11 Alive. 'And I will have to get over (losing it) all again.' Hot rod: Unless a court order allows her car be released, it’ll head off to police auction for the highest bidder .","Car stolen in Duluth, Georgia, in 1972 .

"University students have published an online guide and map which details the best places to smoke cannabis on campus without getting caught. The Aberdeen Tab, a student-run online publication, has highlighted the three best places to smoke cannabis joints in the grounds of the University of Aberdeen without being 'busted'. The article, written by Hal Duke - who is listed as having studied at the university - comes with its own detailed map 'for when times get tough' and points students in the direction of public places to 'enjoy a J in peace'. The Aberdeen Tab, a student-run publication, has highlighted the three best places to smoke cannabis joints at the University of Aberdeen without being caught in a new online guide which comes complete with a map . The online article, written by Hal Duke who is listed as having studied at university, comes with a handy map 'for when times get tough' and points students in the direction of public places to 'enjoy a J in peace' Among the 'best places' touted by the student publication is the iconic 13th century Balgownie Bridge over the River Don and an electricity substation near university accommodation. The article has already been liked by more than 10,000 people on Facebook. In the online piece, Mr Duke writes: 'Even with weed becoming more socially acceptable as an alternative (addition) to alcohol, there are still risks involved with smoking up in public. 'The threat of getting busted constantly hangs over you like untapped ash as you stand out in the open, nervously puffing on something that clearly isn't a cigarette. 'Even if you don't turn around to find the stern hand of a porter on your shoulder, it may just as easily be the eager hand of a fellow student looking to get in on something they didn't shell out for. 'Toke in fear no longer.' He advises students take a walk to the secluded Seaton Gardens which involves climbing through an opening in the wall. He claims the spot 'boasts 360 degree wall coverage to keep the worst of the wind from stealing the best of your smoke, benches to kick back on, and enough chill vibes to inspire several reggae albums'. Among the 'best places' touted by the student publication is the iconic 13th century Balgownie Bridge over the River Don (pictured), as well as an electricity substation situated close to university accommodation . An electricity substation (pictured) is listed in the guide as the second best place to smoke cannabis. It is described as 'the ultimate in stealth spots for those concerned about bumping into any potential leachers' He lists the electricity substation as option number two, describing it as 'the ultimate in stealth spots for those concerned about bumping into any potential leachers/porters/leaching porters'. The third option, for those 'who like a little jaunt with their joint', is highlighted as Balgownie Bridge over the river Don. He writes: 'Once there, you will be treated to a spectacular view across the Don where you can ponder the mysteries of the universe and inter-connectivity of nature in peace.' A University of Aberdeen spokesman could not comment on whether the student would be spoken to about the online article but said: 'The University of Aberdeen has a zero-tolerance approach to drugs on campus. 'The views expressed refer to a number of sites which are not part of the University's campus. 'The University signposts students concerned about drug misuse to relevant support services.'

"The cold weather currently gripping the nation has cancelled work, scrapped flights and ruined plans for millions - but one man refuses to be cowed by Mother Nature. Fraser Cunningham, a 56-year-old engineer, has been cycling to work every single day for the past eighteen months. And even though the temperature in his home town of Madeira, Ohio, has plunged as low as -10°F in recent weeks the biting cold hasn't stopped him pedaling the 16 and a half miles to work and back while others shiver at home. Taking the sub-zero way: Fraser Cunningham, 56, is pictured above on his 17-mile cycle ride to work. When he left his home in Madeira, Ohio, it was -10°F . Something on your face: Cunningham, an engineer for General Electric, wears protective gear, but can't stop icicles forming on his voluminous beard during the cycle . Wrapped in thermals, a protective coat, two pairs of gloves, a helmet - and his voluminous beard - Cunningham spends as long as two hours each way to his job at General Electric. Nonetheless, his commute on Friday was so bitter that his eyelids froze open as he rode. When he shows up around 7.30 each morning, shivering and sporting huge icicles in his beard, his first stop in the bathroom to melt away the damage with warm water. And with another bout of snow predicted this week in a seemingly relentless winter, Cunningham's dedication is likely to be tested again. When the going gets tough: In cold weather, Cunningham's trip can take as long as two hours. To combat icy roads, he swaps to his 'fat bike', which has monster tires less likely to slip . Precarious: In Dallas, the semi truck was left dangling off the I-45 highway as icy roads coated the region . This, and more of this: Cunningham is used to the biting cold - but southern states like Arkansas, the state capitol of which is pictured, have also had unwonted blasts of snow . More to come: Through Wednesday rain and snow could still fall across Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama . Getting chilly: Snow could return to the mid-Atlantic region Wednesday night, hitting Virginia, Tennessee, North and South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama . Explaining his cast-iron commitment, he said: 'I’m going to characterize myself as a bit of a stubborn person.' 'Getting in the car (to go to work) is an option, but only in an absolute, dire emergency.' The option has, rarely, been taken before - he missed his last cycle on July 22, 2013, and his continuous record is around 20 months. He switched to cycling more than a decade ago, and says he will continue until he retires. Cunningham's show of resilience in the cold comes as yet another snowstorm is predicted in the relentless march of bad weather that has left all but two states with snow on the ground. Chill: Pictured above, a man uses a snow blower in La Plata County, Colorado, where two feet fell Monday . Totals: Snow could fall in all the above locations by Thursday - leaving Florida potentially the only U.S. state with no snow at all . First-timers? These kids in Tyler, Texas, were dealing with snow as well Monday when they crossed the street . Given up: Schoolbuses took kids home early in Tyler after the school district called it quits due to bad weather . Snowy: In Oxford, Mississippi, this student made his way across the state university campus in the Monday snow . Forecasters say the fourth wintry blast in quick succession could sweep into the south and move up the Atlantic coast later this week. According to the Weather Channel, northern Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi and Alabama could be snow-hit Tuesday. By Wednesday the precipitation is expected to drift north into Tennessee, North Carolina and Virginia. According to many assessments, South Carolina could also be hit with some snowfall - which would leave Florida the only U.S. state with no snow on the ground. Though the fresh totals are mainly expected to be three inches at most, some areas such as Raleigh, North Carolina, could be hit by up to eight. Coverage: According to The Weather Company, snow is on is on the ground in 48 out of 50 states - with only Florida and South Carolina currently bar .

"Pebble has revealed a colour version of its popular smartwatch in a bid to fend off Apple and Google. Called Pebble Time, the firm has turned to Kickstarter, where it funded its original watch, for the £$199 colour version. The campaign has already been a huge success - with Pebble hitting its target in just seventeen minutes. Scroll down for video . The Pebble Time will cost $199 and will ship in May - although is cheaper for Kickstarter backers . Pebble Time features a new colour e-paper display and microphone for responding to notifications, meaning it can also do voice dictation and even calls. 'At its heart, Pebble Time is an awesome watch,' the firm says.'The new color e-paper display is easy to read and always-on, perfect for displaying incoming notifications and your favorite watchface.' Pebble hopes the battery life of its watch will be a major selling point - both the Apple Watch and Google's Android Wear watches need to be recharged every night. 'Compared with display technology like LCD or OLED, power consumption is minimized, enabling Pebble Time to achieve an industry-leading battery life of up to 7 days.' However, the screen is far lower resolution, and can only display 64 colours. 'It's not going to break any records for number of pixels or whatever,' Eric Migicovsky of Pebble told Backchannel. 'But it does what it has to do to be on a smart watch. 'It's color, it's always on and it uses, for all intents and purposes, the exact same power as our black-and-white display.' The watch will also be able to be fitted with any standard watch strap . The watch is also far thinner, at just 9.5mm. 'Its ergonomic, curved design fits comfortably on either wrist and slides easily under dress shirts,' the firm says. The new design was first leaked yesterday on Pebble's own website. The watch has a new 'timeline interface to allow people to see information depending on what's in their diary or the time of day. According to 9to5mac, the new watch is set to have a thinner design and a colour e-paper-like display. It spotted an image showing off the watch on Pebble's own servers. 'Now, thanks to an image hosted on Pebble's own servers, we have a look at a device with a physical appearance matching the device we described. 'The device looks to have a larger bezel, as well as buttons that are smaller compared to its predecessor.' As we reported, the watch is going to be thinner than the current generation, but you can't really see that based on this image alone. The new watch is also far thinner, at just 9.5mm. And while the new device will have a color display and a slimmer hardware profile, it's said to have battery life that compares to the first generation Pebble. On the inside, the next Pebble is going to have a Cortex M4 processor and a 6-axis gyroscope. Unlike the Apple Watch, the new Pebble won't have a touch screen, and its resolution is definitely on the low side compared to Apple's upcoming device. Compatibility: The smartwatch is compatible with Android 2.3+ and iOS 5+ . Connectivity: The Pebble connects to a smartphone via Bluetooth . Messaging: Wearers can see texts, tweets, calls and app notifications – but they can't use the watch to type messages or make calls, like with the Apple Watch, for example. Battery: The battery lasts for between five and seven days on a single charge and can be recharged using a USB cable with a magnetic connector. Tough: The watch is water resistant with a scratch and shatter-proof e-paper screen. Screen: 144 x 168 pixels, measuring 3.2cm . Apps: The watch has a 'thriving' app store with staples like Twitter as well as fitness apps. Users can also create their own. The Pebble can store eight apps and watch faces at a time. Extras: A vibrating silent alarm and hundreds of watch faces. Colours: White, black, red, grey and orange. Size: The watch is designed to fit most 2.2cm watch straps. It measures 5.2cm x 3.6cm x 1.15cm deep. Weight: 38g . Price: £99 ($99 in the US) and £180 ($199) for the Steel model. The current watch allows wearers to read texts and tweets on their wrist, as well as see incoming calls, check the weather, access fitness apps and tell the time. It is compatible with Apple and Android devices and connects to a smartphone via Bluetooth so users don't have to rummage in their handbag or pockets for their phone to see app notifications and messages, because they appear on the watch's screen. Pebble's device is the second most funded product in Kickstarter history and the new Pebble Steel model is also now available in the UK for £180. The Apple Watch is set to go on sale in April, with prices from $349 . The Moto 360 runs Google's Android Wear software - but has so far failed to attract buyers . They are water resistant and have a battery that lasts for between five and seven days. In contrast, it's predicted that the Apple Watch, which is due to be released early next year, will need to be recharged daily. Firebox predicts that the already popular devices will be in demand from UK customers for Christmas, partly because they are more affordable than some rival offerings. Since its US release last year, Pebble has developed its open-source platform so that anyone can create an app for the device and companies are offering fitness tracker apps like Jawbone and Misfit, so people can check their running pace without carrying another gadget, for example. The upadter Pebble watch, called Pebble Steel, has an e-paper display – like a miniature Kindle – so it can be easily read in bright sunlight, while a flick of the wrist illuminates the screen so it can be used in a the dark. The £180 Pebble Steel Smartwatch is pictured. It has a choice of more luxurious straps, compared with the original watch . The watch has an e-paper display – like a miniature Kindle – so it can be easily read in bright sunlight, while a flick of the wrist illuminates the screen so it can be used in a the dark too. Staples such as Twitter, Yelp and Foursquare are available too.

But it wasn't until little Isaac's life hung in the balance at just 11 days old that Anna was inspired to make some changes to her lifestyle and get fit. Anna Lloyd vowed to lose weight after her little boy Isaac contracted bronchiolitis at just 11 days old - she wanted to be healthy for her family and now weighs 11st 4lb . Poor little Isaac, pictured in ICU in January 2012 was left with his life hanging in the balance after contracting the respiratory tract infection at just 11 days old . As Isaac, now three years old, battled against his illness, tied up to a respiratory machine, Anna made a 'bargain' at his hospital bedside that they should both get healthy. When Isaac recovered and was allowed out of hospital, she kept her promise by joining her local Slimming World group and started exercising and her weight dropped to a much healthier 11st 4lb. Anna said: 'At one stage it was touch and go for Isaac. It was like his lungs had given up and he was being constantly monitored. Anna has now lost weight and is happy with her family. She is pictured here with her husband Tim and their two children Isaac and Isabel . Anna cradled a new born Isaac when he was just three days old, shortly before he was taken back into hospital with an infection . 'I sat by his bedside and it dawned on me that he might not survive. It was the worst moment of my life. 'That's when I made a bargain with him. I said: ""If you get healthy for me, I promise I'll get healthy for you.""' She continued: 'Now looking at Isaac, you'd never guess what he went through when he was only days old. 'He's my inspiration and I'm going to make sure I stay fit and healthy so I can be the mum he deserves.' Anna said she always the 'fat girl' when she was growing up and was teased right through school: 'My parents tried to get me to eat healthily but you have to want it for yourself and I always loved sweets and chocolates. On her wedding day in 2007 Anna was a size 20, she said her husband, Tim, was one of the first people to accept her for her size . 'When I met my husband Tim I was a size 18 and 14st which made me very shy and self-conscious. I didn't think anyone would love me just for me but Tim saw passed my size and we got married in September 2007 with me in a size 20 dress.' In 2008 Anna fell pregnant and found that her weight spiralled out of control, as she felt like she had a 'green light' to eat whatever she wanted. With a BMI of 40, Anna was warned that hers was a 'high risk' pregnancy and she was closely monitored throughout. But everything went smoothly and her daughter Isabel was born in November 2008 weighing 8lb 4oz. At her largest Anna was gorging on take-aways and unhealthy ready meals. She has since joined Slimming World and dropped five stone . But Anna struggled to lose the weight she'd gained during the pregnancy and even stayed in her maternity clothes as Isabel grew into a toddler. By the time Anna fell pregnant with her second baby, in March 2011, she weighed 16st 4lb at just 5ft 4in tall. 'My doctor suggested I join a slimming group for overweight mums, which was mortifying, but I found it really helpful and it stopped me gaining more weight during my pregnancy,' said Anna. 'Isaac was born weighing 8lb 9oz but just a week after we brought him home he developed a nasty cough and it got so bad we had to rush him back into hospital. 'By the time we got him there, he was struggling to breathe and started to turn blue. Everything happened really quickly. A doctor said he had bronchiolitis and had oxygen piped into a headbox to help him breathe.' Anna is now a size 12 and she says she wanted to be healthy for her children . Lttle Isaac was hooked up to a CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machine which encouraged his lungs to work and was transferred by ambulance to Alder Hey Children's hospital in Liverpool where he was ventilated and won his battle for life. With Isaac on the road to recovery, Anna joined her local Slimming World group, cut out fatty takeaways and started to make her own healthy meals, incorporating lots of fresh vegetables and lean met. Along with her new healthy diet, Anna started walking regularly and even took part in a 5k Race for Life. After a year she started boot-camp classes and her fitness improved by leaps and bounds. Isaac is now happy and healthy and although he still has some problems with his breathing Anna has revealed that it hasn't stopped him living a good life . After three years of healthy eating and exercise, Anna has dropped an impressive 5st, now weighing 11st 4lb, with another stone to lose to reach her target weight of 10st 4lb. She now helps other people who are eager to lose weight as she leads two Slimming World classes each week. 'Losing weight has improved every aspect of my life,' she added. 'I can spend quality time with my family doing things I wouldn't have dreamed of before, like going for long walks and swimming. Now I'm a size 12, I can shop wherever I want, not just in plus size stores, which is fantastic.' As for Isaac, he's grown into a happy, confident and active toddler. He still has a weakness in his lungs and uses his inhaler three times a day but that doesn't stop him from jumping and climbing, she says.","Anna Lloyd from Crewe promised her son Isaac she would get healthy .

"Organic food is seeing a revival with sales up £1.4million a week amid evidence of nutrition benefits and the launch of budget ranges in discount stores. The market is bouncing back from a disastrous downturn in the wake of the financial crisis and cost of living squeeze that forced families to cut back their food budgets. Total sales in 2014 exceeded £1.86billion, taking them back up the level last seen in 2009. Families are buying more organic food, particularly dairy produce, despite the fact that they have made big cut backs on conventionally produced food, according to a study by the Soil Association. The organic food market is bouncing back from a disastrous downturn in the wake of the financial crisis . The value of sales of organic products increased by 4per cent in 2014, despite a general fall in all food spending of 1.1per cent in the year. More than a quarter of spending on organic products - 27.9per cent - is in the dairy aisles with sales of milk and yoghurt up by 6.5per cent, which is in stark contrast to the 3per cent fall in non-organic products. Sales of organic eggs were up 15.8per cent, against a fall of 6.2per cent for conventional eggs, while chicken was up by 8.2per cent compared to a fall of 3.3per cent for the non-organic equivalent. Organic fresh fruit sales were up 6.4per cent, tea by 13.7per cent, cereals by 4.2per cent and biscuits by 7.2per cent. There was a dip of 2per cent for organic vegetables, however the fall was a fraction of the five-fold reduction in spending on vegetables from other sources. More than eight in ten households bought some organic products in 2014, according to research by the Soil Association, which sets industry standards. The nutritional credentials of organic received a significant boost last July when landmark research from Newcastle University showed organic fruit, vegetables and cereals were up to 69per cent higher in a number of key antioxidants. The higher levels of the antioxidants, which are recognised as being beneficial in preventing cancer, were equivalent to eating 1-2 extra portions of fruit and vegetables a day. The same research also found lower levels of toxic heavy metals and reduced exposure to pesticides. The Newcastle study was a huge boon for the industry which had previously suffered following a report from the Food Standards Agency which found no meaningful nutritional benefits. There has been a slight reduction in spending on organic vegetables and fruit but overall, organic food sales are booming . A decision by Aldi and Lidl to promote organic food has also delivered a huge increase in sales. The chains are supporting the sector in the belief it will help attract the middle income families they are trying to win away from the major supermarkets. Aldi sells a 1.14litre (2pint) carton of organic semi-skimmed milk for 89p, which compares to 75p for the conventional equivalent. A box of six organic eggs is £2 at Tesco, which is double the price of the free range equivalent. Chief executive at the Soil Association, Helen Browning, said: ‘Three years ago, commentators were writing off the organic market in the UK. Now, with a third year of steady growth, and against a falling overall food market, it’s clear that reports of organic food’s demise were premature to say the least. ‘This reinvigoration may be partly related to an improving economy, but it’s also testament to the fact that retailers and manufacturers who continued to invest in organic lines have continued to thrive. Now, even the discounters are beginning to stock organic ranges.’ The Produce World Group is the UK’s leading grower and supplier of fresh organic vegetables. Its director of agriculture, Andrew Burgess, said: ‘The continuous growth of organic products, despite numerous challenges in the retail environment, highlights the strength of the organic sector. ‘We know from our own figures that more people are buying organic, with taste and quality being big reasons behind this consumer trend.’","Organic food is seeing a revival after a downturn following financial crisis .

"A man who stabbed his girlfriend to death with a kitchen knife after she allegedly told him 'I want you to do it' has been found not guilty of murder. Friends and family of Amy Aiton shook their heads and wept as Michael John Aller, 48, was found guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter on Tuesday. A man yelled out 'you got away with murder, you grub', as Mr Aller was led away after the ruling. Amy Aiton was brutally stabbed  by her partner Michael John Aller in 2012. The court heard Ms Aiton dared Mr Aller to kill her. The Supreme Court found Aller was suffering from an abnormality of the mind when he carried out the 'ferocious' attack. The court head Mr Aller had 'smashed' six cans of bourbon and Coke and several schooners of beer prior to the fatal altercation with Ms Aiton at their Narara property on July 31, 2012. During the fight, he alleged Ms Aiton noticed him looking over at a knife. ""I glanced at it and she saw me glance at it and she said, `Go on ... I want you to do it. You either do it or I'm going to ... do it to you',"" he claimed. Mr Aller said he 'snapped...and repeatedly stabbed Amy.' After brutally stabbing Ms Aiton repeatedly with a kitchen knife, Mr Aller changed into clean clothes and headed to Sydney for a night of drinking at a hotel. Mr Aller had a violent past and history with alcohol abuse, and was hospitalised twice before he killed Ms Aiton in 2012. He turned himself in to police the next morning, and said the duo had an argument that spiralled 'way out of control'. The court also heard Mr Aller had a history of violence and alcohol abuse, and was admitted to hospital on two separate occasions in 2008 and 2011. In 2008, he allegedly threw a brick through his ex-wife's house, and in 2011 he said he had been 'betrayed' by a woman who had an AVO out against him. Mr Aller spent almost nine months in a rehabilitation centre from October 2011 to June 2012, during which time he admitted to thinking about harming his partner and his wife while drunk. It was shortly after leaving rehabilitation that he met Ms Aiton, who had developed a marijuana addiction to cope with injuries suffered in a car accident. Justice Peter Hidden said there was nothing to suggest Mr Aller was capable of the sort of extreme violence shown when killing Ms Aiton. Judge Hidden agreed with the recommendation of forensic psychiatrist Dr Richard Furst that it was highly likely Mr Aller had a serious mental illness prior to the offence, despite some doubts remaining over claims he was 'hearing voices' at the time of the killing. Mr Aller will be sentenced at a later date.","Amy Aiton killed by her partner in 'ferocious' stabbing attack .

"One in five children are  affected by their parents' heavy drinking, with some being verbally abused, physically attacked or left unsupervised, a new report has found. The troubling statistics show more than one million children across Australia are impacted in some way by other's drinking habits, with a further 142,000 'substantially affected' and 10,000 already under child protection. Family violence campaigner and Australian of the Year Rosie Batty is launching the report, 'Hidden harm: Alcohol's impact on children and families,' at NSW Parliament House in Sydney on Tuesday. One million Australian children are affected by their parents' drinking with 10,000 already under child protection as a result, a new report has found (stock image pictured above) Researchers behind the report say alcohol abuse is a factor with almost half of child abuse cases reported each year. Children are also being left unsupervised, verbally assaulted and physically attacked, according to the report. However, the most common harm experienced by children is witnessing verbal or physical conflicts between parents. The report was created after the combination of data provided from child protection services, and surveys and interviews conducted with families impacted by alcohol abuse. Family violence campaigner and Australian of the Year Rosie Batty (pictured) launched the report at NSW Parliament House in Sydney . Experts have said the report highlights the devastating impacted alcohol abuse has across the community, and called for governments to invest in a number of new strategies and plans to tackle alcohol-related problems. Domestic Violence NSW chief executive Moo Baulch said it is time for family violence to be considered a national emergency. 'If there is any comfort at all to be found at present, it is that the issue of domestic and family violence has found itself, not before time, front and centre of the national agenda and public awareness,' Ms Baulch said. 'Governments are now looking to act and I for one welcome robust research findings that provide us with a more complete picture of the problem, and help identify and explore the policies that may address it.' Foundation for Alcohol Research and Education chief executive Michael Thorn said his organisation has created a blueprint for reducing alcohol-fueled family violence. 'We need targeted screening of young people at greater risk of harm; and measures that reduce the availability, target the price, and regulate the promotion of alcohol,' Mr Thorn said. 'We need national public education campaigns that acknowledge and address the role of alcohol in family violence.' There were almost 30,000 police reported incidents of alcohol-related domestic violence in 2011 in just the four states and territories where data is available - NSW, Victoria, the Northern Territory and Western Australia.","One in five Australian children are affected by parents' drinking .

"Rajendra Pachauri has stepped down amid claims he sexually harassed a woman working at his office in Delhi . The head of the UN climate change panel has stepped down amid claims he sexually harassed a woman working at his office in Delhi. India's Rajendra Pachauri pulled out of a meeting in Kenya this week after Indian police started an investigation into the complaint from a 29-year-old researcher. The 74-year-old, chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) since 2002, has denied the claims against him, according to a court order. But today Mr Pachauri, who has also suffered cardiac problems, ended his 13 turbulent years in charge after announcing he was stepping down. It has been reported that the woman claims the alleged harassment included unwanted emails, texts and phone messages. His second term as IPCC chair had been due to . end in October 2015. In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Mr Pachauri . said that his inability to travel to Kenya showed he may be . unable to ensure the 'strong leadership and dedication of time . and full attention by the chair' needed by the panel. 'I have, therefore, taken the decision to step down from my . position as chair of the IPCC some months before completion of . my term,' he wrote. He collected the Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of the IPCC in . 2007, when the panel shared the award with former U.S. Vice . President Al Gore. Findings by the IPCC about global warming are the main guide . for action by almost 200 governments which have agreed to work . out a deal in December 2015 to combat climate change. The panel . completed a set of mammoth reports last year. The United Nations said the IPCC had appointed vice-chairIsmail El Gizouli as acting chair and would continue business asusual. Rajendra Pachauri pulled out of a meeting in Kenya this week after Indian police started an investigation into the complaint from a 29-year-old researcher . Mr Pachauri told Ban Ki-moon (pictured) that his inability to travel to Kenya showed he may be unable to ensure the 'strong leadership and dedication of time and full attention by the chair' needed by the panel . 'The actions taken today will ensure that the IPCC's mission . to assess climate change continues without interruption,' Achim . Steiner, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment . Programme, which oversees the IPCC, said in a statement. Mr Pachauri said he had considered retiring last year after the . IPCC completed a series of reports that raised the probability . that climate change is mainly man-made to at least 95 percent . from 90 percent in its previous study in 2007. He weathered pressure to quit after an error in the 2007 . report exaggerated the rate of melt of Himalayan glaciers.

"A Chinese man is urging officials to toughen up animal protection laws after discovering local children had been using fireworks to play a sick form of Angry Birds with live sparrows. The children trapped the birds in a variety of ways - including using catapults to knock them down - before strapping the stunned or injured birds to fireworks, lighting them and sending them into the air to explode. The sick game was discovered by Huang Chu, 45, from Lantian county in north-western China's Shaanxi province, after he spotted children running away from something in a local park. The sick game was discovered by Huang Chu after he found children had strapped an injured bird to a firework. He took this picture in the hope officials will toughen up animal protection laws in the country . He investigated and discovered it was an unexploded firework. He said: 'I realised it was not going to go off as the fuse had run out, but when I went to walk past it I saw there was a sparrow tied to the side of the firework. 'I took a picture and then I set it free, and it flapped off under a bush.' He  then spoke to  people in the park - where the children had been setting off fireworks all morning - and found several more bloodied and mutilated dead birds which had already been torn apart by the fireworks. He said: 'I spoke to an older boy who told me that the others had been playing Angry Birds, shooting the fireworks across the park and pretending to be playing the video game of the same name.' The children said they were pretending to play popular video game Angry Birds (pictured) - but with real birds . Angry Birds is a popular video game franchise played primarily on mobile phones. In it, the player must fling a wingless bird at a pig’s fortress in order to gain points and get through to the next round. Mr Chu added: 'I posted images online because people should be aware of what's happening and maybe it will increase pressure for animal rights laws to finally be introduced here in China.'","Huang Chu, 45, saw children had strapped a live sparrow to a firework .

"'Fake' autographs: Classical singer Katherine Jenkins (pictured) has called in trading standards . Classical singer Katherine Jenkins has called in trading standards officials to investigate a company for selling allegedly fake signed photos of her. The 34-year-old mezzo-soprano posted on Twitter yesterday that Autographed Music Photos in Maldon, Essex, was selling the pictures - adding: ‘I did not sign these’. But the company claimed to MailOnline today that it obtained the four signed images and a Christmas CD from a supplier who bought them at a charity auction in 2012 after they were donated by her management. Miss Jenkins tweeted yesterday: ‘Want to warn you that Autographed Music Photos is selling “authentic” photos signed by me. I did not sign these and we're reporting to trading standards.’ However the company said it was ‘aggrieved’ that Miss Jenkins had taken to Twitter to report a problem with the pictures before members of her management had got in touch. A spokesman told MailOnline: ‘We're quite annoyed she tweeted without anybody contacting us first, so that we could do something about this. As soon as we were aware of it, we immediately removed them. ‘We only had three or four photos and a Christmas CD signed by her. I've gone back to the guy who bought them from a charity auction, and [he said] they were donated by her management in 2012.’ It was tonight still unconfirmed where the photographs came from, but Miss Jenkins's management insisted that she 'obviously knows her own signature' and 'did not sign' them. Took to Twitter: Miss Jenkins is concerned about a company selling allegedly fake signed photos of her . Autograph session: Miss Jenkins is pictured signing copies of her new album at HMV Cardiff last November . He added: ‘If anybody contacts us, whoever it is, we're always responsive and immediately take action. We've certainly had no disgruntled customer about it. It's come completely out of the blue.’ Miss Jenkins's memorabilia would usually sell for £20 to £30, the company said, adding that it had not yet been contacted by trading standards - but would keep the items available for inspection. But Miss Jenkins’s manager, Jonathan Shalit OBE, told MailOnline: ‘We tried to contact the company. Katherine also hardly ever signs her photos “Katherine Jenkins” so you can quite clearly tell someone is forging them. ‘Katherine spends hours and hours of time to sign things herself and that's why she was particularly upset as she doesn't want her fans to be ripped off. She regularly tweets that people can send in anything as she is happy to sign them for free. Happy couple: Miss Jenkins with her partner, film director Andrew Levitas, whom she married last year . ‘It was brought to our attention as a fan had purchased one which had a certificate of authentication and had asked Katherine to personalise it. 'Katherine obviously knows her own signature and realised straight away she did not sign it. ‘We still have this in our possession as proof and when on further investigation we looked at their website they themselves had four or five different forms of Katherine's signature. We also emailed autograph trading standards and they are assisting.' Autographed Music Photos insists on its website that all signed items are supplied by 'an established music and media industry employee, a person that we've known both personally and professionally for many years'. The firm - which is is run from a £350,000 four-bedroom detached house - also claims to be a member of the Universal Autograph Collectors' Club, although it is not listed within the Florida-based organisation's official dealer directory. Website: Autographed Music Photos claimed it obtained the four signed images and a Christmas CD from a supplier who bought them at a charity auction in 2012 after they were donated by her management . The Autograph Fair Trade Association confirmed tonight that it was investigating the complaint, but this could take months – and it was normal practise to ask trading standards to get involved. An AFTAL spokesman said: ‘Katherine's management company contacted us to say that there was a company called Autographed Music Photos selling autographs of her that were not authentic. ‘We had a look at it, and there were probably about half a dozen that Katherine said weren’t her signature. They do have a lot of quite unique stuff. It’s not a company that we’ve heard of before.’ An Essex County Council spokesman said: ‘The ECC’s trading standards team has not received complaints about this company and is not currently pursuing any investigation into this matter.’","Mezzo-soprano criticises Autographed Music Photos of Maldon, Essex .

"A Darwin man knew it was no laughing matter when he spotted a kookaburra wedged into a parked car's numberplate. Russell Crow, 50, found the beautiful blue-winged kookaburra jammed into the vehicle bumper at Humpty Doo United servo, 40 km south of Darwin. After noticing the bird was still alive, Mr Crow managed to move the animal from harm's way with some unlikely utensils, reports NT News. The blue-winged kookaburra was found wedged into the front of a parked car's bumper at Humpty Doo United servo . Mr Crow assumed thought the animal was long dead when he first noticed it. 'Even when I walked over to it, I could see it had an eye open but I still thought it was dead — it was pretty still,' he told NT News. After photographing the peculiar scene, the kookaburra moved its head. But when Mr Crow attempted to freeit with his hands, the bird attacked him. 'I was trying to pull it out with my hands, but he kept trying to bite me,' he said. Kookaburras have extremely strong beaks which they use to soften their food. In turn, they can inflict a painful bite. Mr Crow resolved to use a mop and bucket to free the captive bird, which was miraculously unharmed. The blue winged kookaburra is susceptible to being hit by cars on country roads due to being a slow flyer . 'I used the mop to pry him out, and it worked. I was expecting him to have a broken wing or to be injured in some way, but as soon as he hit the ground he flew off and into a gum tree.' Mr Crow left a note on the car advising them to check their grille after striking an animal on the road. The blue winged kookaburra is native to northern Australia and southern New Guinea. Due to being slow flyers, they are susceptible to being hit by cars on country roads. The  assistant curator for Territory Wildlife Park Damien Stanioch said the car was travelling between 60-70km/h when it hit the bird. The bird was found at Humpty Doo United servo, 40 km south of Darwin in the Northern Territory .","Russell Crow, 50, found the blue-winged kookaburra wedged into a car .

"A woman has exacted the ultimate revenge on her roommate after she wrapped every item in his bathroom with cling wrap and aluminium foil. Shari Griffin, who lives in Darwin, was getting her roommate named Chris back for parking horizontally across both car spaces in their apartment block as a prank. 'I came on a Sunday night at 9.30pm and... at the time I had to do a 50-point turn and go back down three storeys and park on the road. I was pissed off,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

"A Colombian military cook is being investigated after he was seen taking a bath in a cauldron used to make soup for troops. Victor Gamboa, 27, was caught by a fellow chef as he stripped off and got into the huge vat before starting to wash his hair and body. The incident took place in Bogota last July, but the news of Mr Gamboa's unusual choice of bathtub only reached top brass this week after pictures were leaked online. Disgusting: Victor Gamboa, 27, was caught on camera as he stripped off to take a bath, washing his 'hair, feet and genitals' in a military soup cauldron at a base in Bogota, Colombia . Gamboa, who serves in the Colombian Military Police Battalion in the Colombian capital was snapped in the kitchen at the base, stripping off and climbing into the huge vat of water. Sous chef Juan Camargo Cubillos, 24, said Gamboa then took a bottle of shampoo and began washing his hair before turning to the rest of his body. Caught: Gamboa is now under investigation after pictured of his 'soup bath' leaked online . 'He was dressed in his uniform but then took it off and climbed into the vat of water which is used everyday to make soup,' Mr Cubillos told a local newspaper. 'First he washed his hair and then started doing his feet and genitals. 'It was completely grotesque and I couldn't believe what I was seeing. 'But when I asked him what the hell he was doing he just laughed and said I shouldn't worry about it.' Mr Cubillos says the incident in July last year was hushed up  and that he was told to delete all photos, but they have now emerged on the internet. Base commander General Raul Antonio Rodriguez said: 'It's illogical for a soldier to do this because the cauldrons are lit for 18-hours-a-day at high temperatures. 'It looks like it all happened in July 2014 when the place was shut after an order from the Health Secretariat. 'But everything is under investigation and if disciplinary measures are needed, they will be applied immediately.'","Victor Gamboa, 27, caught taking a bath in a military soup cauldron .

"A house was 'disintegrated' and five people rushed to the hospital on Tuesday when a natural gas leak caused a dramatic explosion in a New Jersey neighborhood. New Jersey Natural Gas workers were called to Oak Avenue in Stafford Township Tuesday morning after reports of a suspicious odor in the neighborhood. While investigating a possible leak, a house at the far east end of the street exploded - sending flames into the air, shattering windows of surrounding houses and shaking the ground a mile around. Five workers were injured in the blast - with at least one who was in an extremely critical state and needed CPR on the scene. The current condition of the five gas workers is not currently known. Devastating: Five New Jersey Natural Gas workers were injured - one critically - when a leak caused a massive explosion that leveled a house on the New Jersey shore Tuesday morning . The explosion was captured by a police dash cam that was parked nearby . The house disintegrated into tiny little pieces after the explosion . The debris went flying all the way down the street . Helicopter footage of the blast site shows debris littering the street, smoke filled air, and a hole in the ground - the basement that is the only remnant of the leveled home. 'The house has been disintegrated,' Stafford Township Mayor John Spodofora told NBC New York. The sheer force of the blast was felt across the community, with some saying the tremor shook their homes as far as a mile away. 'It was kind of like a mini-earthquake,' Plowing contractor Max Von Newss said. 'You were thinking it was like a bomb.' 'It looks like a war area. It's just destruction. There's debris all over the place,' Mr Von Ness added. All that's left: The above scene shows where a house used to stand before the explosion which virtually disintegrated the structure . Devastating: Residents first reported a gas odor around 8:55am on Tuesday . Earth-shattering: Those in the community could feel the explosion shake their homes from nearly a mile away . Victims: The conditions of the five injured workers is not immediately known . Without homes: About 75 to 100 homes in the surrounding area have been evacuated and the gas line shut off . The gas odor was first reported around 8.55am, and were trying to contain the leak at 10:45am when the blast occured. Neighborhood resident Barbara Cotov told the Press of Atlantic City that the smell was 'terribly strong' and filled her entire house. She says she was told to evacuate by men in uniforms who said: 'To be safe, you need to leave.' She felt the blast as she was driving to get coffee and buy groceries. 'When I saw all that smoke, I said ""Oh my God, is that my house,""' she said. Luckily, her house had been spared.

"A 'devious and calculating' accounts manager who stole £23,000 from a TV star's home improvements company was jailed for 16 months today. Abeyomi Ogunagbadaro, 44, had only been working at home expert Alison Cork's Alison At Home furniture business in Regent Street, central London, for six weeks when he started stealing from the firm. The financial controller, who was on a £42,000-a-year salary, had access to the company's online bank account and was able to launder payments via two innocent friends he duped into giving him their bank details. 'Devious and calculating' accounts manager Abeyomi Ogunagbadaro (left) who stole £23,000 from a TV star Alison Cork's (right) home improvements company was jailed for 16 months today . Mother-of-two Ms Cork, 51, has appeared in a number of home and garden shows and is best known for her ITV series 'Don't Move, Improve'. Ogunagbadaro, who started work at the company Alison At Home on March 4 last year, admitted one charge of fraud by abuse of position and was jailed for 16 months when he appeared in front of Southwark Crown Court today. The fraud was only discovered after Ogunagbadaro had left the company in May of that year. Peter Zinner, prosecuting, said: 'This was a very sophisticated, pre-planned fraud by a devious and calculating defendant who abused his position as a financial controller to his own financial gain. 'The offence, say the Crown, was aggravated by the use of various lies and by the involvement of two innocent people in an attempt to launder, or disguise, where the monies were being transferred to. 'Those two innocent people were put in the threat of prosecution by their unwitting involvement.' Abeyomi Ogunagbadaro, 44, had only been working at home expert Alison Cork's Alison At Home furniture business, based on the third floor of this building in Regent Street, central London, for six weeks when he started stealing from the firm . Mr Zinner told the court that soon after starting with Alison At Home, Ogunagbadaro had made a number of mistakes, but had tried to cover this up by pretending that a young relative had died. 'His employment commenced on the 4 March 2014, but there were immediately problems during his probation period with accounting errors and processing errors which resulted in him being spoken to by supervisors,' Mr Zinner said. 'To elicit sympathy from his employers the defendant lied about illness and death of a child in his family and because of that he was given a little bit of latitude and time off.' However, the story was a sham and there had been no death or illness in his family. 'As his performance was not good he parted company, it seems amicably, with Alison At Home on May 7 but shortly afterwards the owners of the company decided they would do an audit and in particular they were concerned about three unrecognised transfers,' said Mr Zinner. Two payments of £4,000 each were made to Vanessa Murphy and a further £15,000 was sent to Daniel Collen. Mother-of-two Ms Cork, 51, (pictured) has appeared in a number of home and garden shows and is best know for her ITV series 'Don't Move, Improve' Interior design and homes expert Alison Cork is best known for her appearances on Peter Andre's 60 Minute Makeover and her own ITV daytime show 'Don't Move, Improve', where she travelled the country with co-presenter Michael Holmes. The pair would assess a homeowners’ current property and suggested two options of how they could renovate in order to meet their family’s needs. They would then return to see if the family had listened to their advice, and check out the finished results. Mother-of-two Ms Cork, 51, has also worked as a presenter on Carlton Food Network, the BBC and Channel 5, as well as radio stations LBC and BBC Radio Wales. She has also written on homes and interiors for numerous publications, including the Mail On Sunday. Ms Cork launched her furniture business Alison At Home in 2012, and has also been behind two collections for online site Made.com. She also offers help and advice on homes and decorating, as well as lifestyle and cookery tips via her Alison At Home website. Her latest venture, One Regent Place, which sells discounted home and garden products launched last year. Ms Cork is also an ambassador for The Prince's Initiative for Mature Enterprise (PRIME), which was set up by the Prince of Wales to help support entrepreneurs over the age of 50 and campaign for older workers' rights. 'The two payments were made without the consent or authority of the accountants signing off at Alison At Home, the recipients of the funds were not related to the business and suspicion fell on Mr Ogunagbadaro as he had actioned all the transfers.' Ogunagbadaro had tricked his friends into receiving the money by telling them he wanted to conceal a bonus payment from his family and lying that he needed help keeping the cash because he had a drug problem, the court was told. But Charles Shelton, mitigating, said there was 'still a chance of redemption' for his client. 'The whole situation is highly regrettable,' he said. 'We have here a man who was in a downward spiral of drink and drugs that reach its nadir.' He said Ogunagbadaro only spent '10 per cent' of the money on himself and used the rest to fund 'the shallow circle of friends who he doesn't hang out with any more'. But none of the money has ever been recovered and Ogunagbadaro has not paid a penny back. Judge Martin Beddoe said the fraudster was a 'mature and educated man'. 'Very shortly after starting a trusted job on a very good salary employed as a financial controller for this firm, you gained access to their online banking system,' he said. 'You were trusted to use it for the purposes of your job and you abused their trust in you by setting up the transfer for funds totalling £23,000 from your employer's accounts.' The judge added it took Ogunagbadaro only six weeks to set up the 'apparatus to defraud'. 'Apart from the seriousness of the deceit of your employers and the very considerable breach of trust as far as they are concerned, to commit this crime you had to trick, and did trick, with elaborate lies two friends of yours,' said Judge Beddoe. 'It was in my judgement a sophisticated fraud, sophisticated enough to be given that description and it involved gross breaches of trust along the way. 'There was nothing reckless about your conduct Mr Ogunagbadaro, it was quite purposive and deliberate.' The judge also criticised the defendant for blaming alcohol and cocaine as 'excuses latched on to'. Ogunagbadaro, of Kilburn, north west London, was led to the cells carrying his belongings in a Louis Vuitton rucksack.","Abeyomi Ogunagbadaro, 44, worked at Alison Cork's furniture business .

"Ann Walters, 61 (pictured at age 39), was found dead on her living room floor, 10 hours after she called NHS 111 for help . A distraught son found his mother dead on her living room floor nearly 10 hours after she phoned for medical help. Ann Walters' call to the NHS 111 line was categorised as an emergency, passed to the 999 service and an ambulance was dispatched to her home. The journey was estimated to take around seven minutes. However, for reasons that remain unclear, the ambulance turned back when it was just four minutes away - under instruction from the NHS 999 service. Mrs Walters, 61, had a hole in her heart and it is thought she died from died from heart failure. Her son Lawrence Thorpe, 24, found his mother on the living room floor of her home in Portsmouth, Hampshire, at 6pm. He checked her phone log and discovered she had called the NHS 111 line at 8.25am. However no medical help arrived at his mother's home until an out-of-hours GP arrived at 8.30pm that evening. It remains unclear why the GP had been asked to attend, given that Mrs Walters' initial call had been passed to the emergency services. And it is not known whether the GP was called by the NHS 111 service or the 999 service, however both are run by South Central Ambulance Services (SCAS) in the area. SCAS said it had launched two investigations into the incident, which occurred on December 28 last year. One investigation will focus on why the ambulance was sent back and the other on why it took so long for an out-of-hours GP to attend. Mr Thorpe believes had the ambulance arrived at his mother's home, she could still be alive today. He now wants to know why help was sent so late. He said: 'Knowing there was an ambulance minutes away from reaching my mum, I believed it could have saved her life. 'Even if it was only for an hour so, my sister Felicity could have had a chance to say goodbye.' Mr Thorpe continued: 'At about 8.30pm, an out-of-hours GP came to the house to see my mum. 'Obviously we told him what had happened and he said he had been called at 4.45pm. The ambulance service is now carrying out an investigation into Mrs Walters' death. Her daughter Felicity Thorpe, 25, (left) and son Lawrence, 24, (right) believe that had she received help sooner, she may have lived . Mrs Walters (pictured here aged 54) had a hole in her heart and it is thought she died of heart failure. An ambulance sent to  her was recalled when it was just minutes away from her home . 'However, because of a high workload he said he couldn't get to her until 8.30pm.' SCAS has said it does not know why an earlier ambulance was cancelled, but the phone operator involved has been suspended, according to Mr Thorpe. He said: 'I'm infuriated that she called for help and that no help came. 'Instead I was left to find my mother dead, and my sister - who hadn't spoken to my mum for several years - was robbed of her chance to say goodbye. 'I want to share this story so that in future, others may not have to suffer a similar fate. 'At least that way, her possibly-preventable death will not be in vain.' A SCAS spokesperson said: 'The original call was answered and correctly assessed by the NHS 111 service and was very quickly and appropriately passed to the 999 service given the nature of the call and the information given by the caller. Felicity and Lawrence Thorpe, Mrs Walters' children, say they were 'robbed' of the chance to say goodbye to their mother (pictured here aged 23) 'A full investigation is currently underway focusing on all aspects of our response to this patient. 'South Central Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust takes our response to patients very seriously and we would like to apologise to the family for the distress caused as a result of this regrettable incident and would like to offer our sincere condolences. 'We are in contact with the patient's family so that we can fully address their concerns. 'SCAS follows all internal policies and procedures in the handling of such cases. 'As this investigation is still ongoing we are unable to comment further at this time.'","Ann Walters, 61, was found dead at 6pm on December 28 last year .

"The Duke of Cambridge today admitted that he is a fan of the BBC show Dragons' Den as he awarded businessman and former panelist James Caan a CBE. James Caan, who visited the palace today to receive the honour, said it was 'amazing' to meet William and admitted he was thrilled to find out that the prince was a regular viewer. William was making his final UK appearance at the investiture ceremony ahead of his visit to China and Japan, with the Prince set to fly to Tokyo on Thursday. James Caan received a CBE at Buckingham Palace today that was presented to him by Prince William who admitted that he was a fan of Dragons Den . The business mogul received a CBE for services to entrepreneurship and charitable services through his James Caan Foundation. James, 54, who was born in Pakistan but moved to the UK aged two and now resides in London, said: 'He said to me ""we miss you on Dragons' Den""'. It is not clear who the 'we' refers to but it suggest that the Duke might enjoy the show with his wife the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate - unless of course it is the royal 'we'. The entrepreneur added that it was a delight to meet the Prince and it served as a reminder of the importance of British heritage. He said: 'It was amazing to meet the Duke. He is just so charming.' When James met the Duke of Cambridge he told James that 'We miss you on Dragons' Den'. Pictured: The dragons in 2010 (left to right) Duncan Bannatyne, Deborah Meaden, Peter Jones and Theo Paphitis . James continued: 'I just adore the British history and culture and the whole formality of today. 'We should treasure this in this country.' The entrepreneur was one of the formidable judges on the BBC television programme from 2007 until 2010. And the former dragon says he is still struck by some of the more outlandish inventions pitched to him on the show. 'I remember a couple who came on the show because they felt married couples don't get a good night's sleep because the woman moves over to the husband or vice versa. 'They felt the way to solve that issue was to invent a white sheet with a black line down the middle. 'I thought, why don't you just use a ruler? 'It's a good reminder of some of the crazy ideas you get in the den.' Hanah (left) and Jemma Caan, stand with their father James Caan, as he holds his Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) outside Buckingham Palace . Despite leaving the show five years ago James revealed that, like William, he tunes in to Dragons' Den regularly. And the entrepreneur is looking forward to seeing the new judging line-up after panelists Duncan Bannatyne and Kelly Hoppen announced their departure from the show. He said: 'I think it's good to change things and dragons. Once you have been on the show for a while it becomes bland because you can anticipate each other. 'Any time a new dragon comes in it makes it more edgy.' The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge often like to spend time at home watching television when not undertaking official duties. In the past, the royal couple has revealed themselves to be fans of the TV dramas Homeland and Downton Abbey, as well as the ITV talent show X Factor. Nikki Gewirtz was one of the honorees at Buckingham Palace today . The Duke of Cambridge was on cheerful form today as he took part in an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace. Resplendent in a gold-braided uniform, the 32-year-old smiled broadly as he welcomed honorees to the Palace, among them Nikki Gewirtz, the 44-year-old founder of jewellery brand, Lola Rose. Ms Gewirtz, whose pieces are a favourite with the Duchess of Cambridge as well as numerous celebrities, joins an exclusive club of designers honoured by the Palace, most famously Vivienne Westwood and Alice Temperley. Speaking to MailOnline, Gewirtz says she was 'absolutely delighted and humbled' to spot her name on the New Year's Honours list, which also included actresses Joan Collins and Sheridan Smith. 'I am absolutely delighted and humbled,' said the ecstatic designer. 'The fashion industry has been incredibly supportive and to be joining the ranks of such eminent talent is an honour.' Now Gewirtz, who was presented with an MBE, is hoping her unexpected success will encourage other budding designers to follow in her footsteps. 'I believe that we must celebrate British designers,' she explains. 'We have some of the finest in the world. 'It's the ability to think outside the box and break rules that results in the extraordinary and as a nation, we shine at turning things on their head and coming up with something unique.' Among the designers to have honours bestowed on them in recent years are Betty Jackson who in 1987 was handed an MBE and in 2007 a CBE. Alice Temperley and Anya Hindmarch have both been handed gongs, as has Vivienne Westwood who turned up to collect her MBE in 1992 wearing no knickers beneath her dress. She repeated the trick for a second time in 2006 when she was invited to Buckingham Palace to collect a Damehood from Prince Charles. Luckily for the Duke of Cambridge, Gehwirtz had no such inclinations and the investiture ceremony, which is usually done by the Queen or Prince Charles, passed off smoothly. On Thursday, the prince will fly to Tokyo for the start of a six-day tour that will also take him, for the first time, to Beijing. During his visit, which will involve a trip on one of Japan's legendary bullet trains, he will be introduced to his Japanese opposite number - Prince Hisahito of Akishino. The meeting is not expected to be particularly formal, however, as Prince Hisahito is just eight years old. After Japan, he will travel on to China where he will visit Beijing and Shanghai.

"It's not every day that a property boasting one of the most ancient wonders of the world hits the market. Built on an expansive 431 hectares in Esperance, Western Australia, the full-size recreated Stonehenge has long been a sight to rival the real thing- and for only $5 million the granite marvel could be yours. Kim and Jillian Beale unexpectedly became the proud owners of the unusual backyard edifice in 2009, when the replica commissioned by the quarry next to their property failed to find the funding required to transport it to the Margaret River. Scroll down for video . The Esperance Stonehenge is the only complete life-size Stonehenge replica in the world . The edifice, along with a homestead and 431 acres, has hit the market for the asking price of $5 million . 'The community was keen for it to stay, and there was some talk of the Rotary Club taking responsibility for it, but a site just didn't come up in time,' Kim told Daily Mail Australia. 'So we decided to put our hand up. There was some doubt as to whether we could make it work, but we did,' he said. The cattle farmers erected the edifice, which is the only complete life size replica of pre-historic English structure Stonehenge made entirely of granite in the world, and decided to operate it as a tourism venture. 'It was meant to be a semi-retirement plan, but it's become so popular it's turned into a full-time job,' said Kim. Esperance Stonehenge, hit the local tourism industry in 2010, weighing over 2500 tonnes and made of 137 stones of local pink granite from the quarry. Since then, the unusual wonder has seen over 30,000 visitors and has made a name for itself both nationally and overseas. The unusual wonder has seen over 30,000 visitors since it opened as a tourist attraction in 2010 . The Beales have applied to  subdivide the property to separate Esperance Stonehenge from the farm they run . The homestead boasts three bedrooms and two bathrooms and is just 90 metres away from the edifice . The Beales live in the two-storey farmhouse, also up for sale, just 90 metres away from the structure, gaining a view that few in the world could lay claim to. 'We've transformed the shed into a really lovely office which overlooks the Esperance Stonehenge, and our house is right next door, so all day, five days a week I look at it,' Kim said. The property has been on the market for a year, as the couple look for an actual retirement plan to put into action. Advertised as Lot 35, Merivale, Esperance, the asking price is $5 million, though the Beales have applied to rezone and subdivide the property to separate Esperance Stonehenge from the beef farm they also run. 'We put it on the market because we know the age we are at. This could develop into a huge tourist precinct. If there's anyone who is passionate about tourism and something a bit different, this could be the right property for them,' Kim said. 'It's an iconic structure, and we have quite a few overseas tourists who come in and know about it. Australians might not see ancient history as something important and never know the worth of these structures,' he said. Estate agent for the property, Ron Johnstone, described the expansive site as a unique opportunity . The Beales believe their 'once-in-a-lifetime' property will make some lucky buyer happy . Mr Beale said that visitors often take as many pictures of the cattle as they do of the structure . 'We're still trying to figure out exactly how it was made- we always tell people we couldn't work it out and just cheated.' Estate agent for the property, Ron Johnstone, described the expansive site as a unique opportunity. 'We've had quite a bit of interest, and once we get the subdivision through we may get more offers focused purely on Stonehenge or the beef far,' Mr Johnstone said. The property offers the best that the South Coast of Western Australia has to offer, combining the two prosperous industries of agriculture and tourism. The beef farm supports Gelbvieh cattle stud and commercial cattle, and boasts abundant pastures which have been well tended to. Advertised as Lot 35, Merivale, Esperance, the asking price is $5 million . The homestead boasts three bedrooms and two bathrooms . The two-storey house also offer a spacious living, dining and kitchen area with polished floorboards . 'There are often cows sitting on either side of the road as people drive down. We get hundreds of people walking down the path, especially when cruise ships come through, and they spend as much time taking photos of the cattle as they do of the Stonehenge,' said Mr Beale. With 4.7 kilometres of road frontage, not to mention rolling coastal views, the Beales believe their 'once-in-a-lifetime' property will make some lucky buyer happy. The two-storey house also offer a spacious living, dining and kitchen area with polished floorboards.

"The United States is probing major banks over possible manipulation of precious metals markets, it has been reported. The investigation centers on prices for gold, silver, platinum and palladium. It is being carried out by the Justice Department with help from Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates raw materials and derivatives. The banks probed by the US government over possible manipulation of precious metals markets include HSBC, Bank of Nova Scotia, Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Societe Generale, Standard Bank and UBS . The banks targeted are HSBC, Bank of Nova Scotia, Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Societe Generale, Standard Bank and UBS, according to the Wall Street Journal. The probes are at the preliminary stage, but HSBC, in releasing yearly results Monday, noted requests from the Justice Department and the CFTC over the precious metals probe, the Journal said. HSBC was one of several banks named in lawsuits filed in U.S. courts last year alleging a conspiracy to manipulate gold, silver, platinum and palladium prices, as well as precious metals derivatives, during the daily precious metals fixes. The century-old gold fix is a standard price for the metal that banks set twice a day over the phone. Some gold traders claim they were harmed by a scheme to manipulate the fix. The banks operating the precious metals benchmarks, known as the fixes, said last year they would no longer administer that process. The investigation centers on prices for gold, silver, platinum and palladium. It is being carried out by the Justice Department with help from Commodity Futures Trading Commission . An electronic daily silver price benchmark is now administered by Thomson Reuters and CME Group, while the London Metal Exchange provides twice-daily benchmark platinum and palladium prices. ICE Benchmark Administration will run an electronic gold price benchmark from March 20 to replace the London gold fix. Switzerland's financial watchdog said in November it had found a 'clear attempt' to manipulate precious metals price benchmarks. An investigation by German regulator Bafin found no signs of attempted benchmark price manipulation in precious metals, newspaper Handelsblatt reported last month. HSBC is currently mired in a scandal surrounding allegations that the bank helped wealthy clients dodge taxes. It said past practices at its Swiss private bank were 'unacceptable' as it reported that 2014 net income fell 16 percent to $13.7billion. HSBC acknowledged Monday that 2014 profits 'disappointed' and said the figures included the costs of paying settlements to cover past failings. These include $550million the bank set aside last year to cover penalties for manipulating foreign currency markets.","Investigation centers on prices for gold, silver, platinum and palladium .

"Julie Bishop has revealed the heartbreaking moment Myuran Sukumaran's mother hugged her tightly and begged her to save her  son from the firing squad. Lawyers for Bali Nine duo Myuran Sumkumaran and Andrew Chan lost an appeal on Tuesday to challenge Indonesia's presidential decree to spare the men from execution. The Foreign Minister said while the pair's lawyers were lodging an appeal, she hoped Indonesia would see the 'value in these men's lives' as the federal government seeks a stay of execution. 'My last meeting with Mrs Sukumaran she hugged me so tightly I could hardly breathe,' Ms Bishop told Nine's Today show. Scroll down for video . Julie Bishop has revealed the heartbreaking moment Myuran Sukumaran's mother, Raji, hugged her tightly and begged her to save her drug smuggler son's life . Lawyers for Bali Nine duo Myuran Sumkumaran and Andrew Chan lost an appeal on Tuesday to challenge Indonesia's presidential decree to spare the men from execution . 'She begged me to do all I could to save the life of her son whose own life had been rehabilitated in such an extraordinary way. 'No person could fail to be touched by the anguish of the families.' It comes as a Jakarta court determined on Tuesday it couldn't examine Indonesian president Joko Widodo's decision to refuse clemency for Chan and Sukumaran as they await execution in Bali. Lawyers for the two Australians will appeal the court's decision not to hear their last-ditch challenge, arguing it would be unthinkable if they were executed in the meantime. Authorities say preparations are being made to move the convicted drug smugglers to the prison island where they are set to face the firing squad, with the move ""very likely"" this week. 'We are very disappointed that the appeal was lost at this point,' Ms Bishop said. The Foreign Minister said while the pair's lawyers were lodging an appeal, she hoped Indonesia would see the 'value in these men's lives' as the federal government seeks a stay of execution. Myuran Sukumaran's mother, Raji (pictured with his siblings Chinthu (left) and daughter Brintha (right) begged Julie Bishop to save her son's life as he awaits execution in Bali . 'We continue to appeal to President Joko Widodo's sense of generosity and his sense of forgiveness and hope that he will consider these clemency pleas and that there will be a stay of execution.' Ms Bishop said she wasn't understating the gravity of their drug crimes, but noted it was 10 years ago and they had made efforts to rehabilitate with Chan now a priest and Sukumaran being an accomplished artist. 'Both men have been rehabilitated in the most remarkable way. They are adding value to prison life in that they are working with other prisoners. 'They are rehabilitating other prisoners and helping Indonesia with this whole process of rehabilitating people, such as drug offenders.' Todong Mulya Lubis, the pair's lawyer, said that their legal team would appeal the judge's decision after court ruled it couldn't examine Indonesian president Joko Widodo's decision to refuse clemency . Lawyers for Andrew Chan (left) and Myuran Sukumaran (right) will challenge the presidential decree that denied them clemency in a Jakarta court . Lawyers for the Bali Nine duo now have 14 days to lodge an appeal, according to one of their lawyers Peter Morrissey. '(Indonesia) have a court system, they have a rule of law and when you have the rule of law it stands to reason that you just don't execute the people who are litigating,' Mr Morrissey said. 'So what we think will happen is that the Indonesian executive will likely cooperate with the rule of law and act in accordance with it and not do anything drastic unless all legal impediments really are removed. And right now there is a live appeal on foot. 'We are very hopeful about it, you know. We are not going to give up. Even if we had no hope we wouldn't give up. But we do have hope because the argument is a sensible good argument.' Advisers to Indonesia's President Joko Widodo (pictured) say he should get the executions over and done with . It's a rare challenge, and the only one like it was brought by an anti-drugs group against the decision to grant clemency to another Australian drug smuggler, Schapelle Corby . Lawyers for the pair argued in court that the Indonesian president  did not follow due process when he denied the Bali Nine pair clemency. They claimed that President Joko did not consider their circumstances  because the pair were death row drug offenders. The only other case ever deemed to be outside the realm of the court was brought against fellow Australian Schapelle Corby. When the same challenge was brought by an anti-drugs group against the decision to grant clemency to the convicted drug smuggler in 2012, the court ruled that it had no power to overturn presidential decrees. The 37-year-old is now free on parole. Authorities say it's 'very likely' the Bali Nine duo will this week be relocated to the island where Indonesia plans to execute them. Ms Bishop said she wasn't understating the gravity of their drug crimes, but noted it was 10 years ago and they had made efforts to rehabilitate with Chan now a priest and Sukumaran being an accomplished artist . Ms Bishop said both men have been rehabilitated in the most remarkable way and were helping to rehabilitate other prisoners in Bali . Reports from the Indonesian government indicate that the duo will be transported via military planes to Nusakambangan penal island. It has not been confirmed whether the government will use a Hercules plane which will mean a journey by both air and land for the pair, or the smaller airforce fighter jets which can land directly on the island. Four jets from Denpasar airport have the capacity to land in the regency of Cilacap, where Nusakambangan is located, and would take an estimated three hours to fly the 900 kilometres from Bali to the island where the Australians are scheduled to be executed. If the Indonesian government made the decision to deploy a Hercules from Densapar, where the pair are being held, to Yokyakarta, the former capital in East Java, Chan and Sukumaran would then have a four-hour road journey to reach the Cilacap port to be ferried to Nusakambangan Island. Chan and Sukumaran were to be transferred from their Bali jail cells to the island last week, but it was found to have inadequate isolation cells. Indonesian Attorney General HM Prasetyo on Monday said preparations were now 'about 80 per cent' complete. Construction materials have been arriving on the island and a jail official has said there are orders to accelerate the works for completion within days.

"A Chinese woman was kept in a filthy shed and 'treated like an animal' after her parents locked her up because they did not approve of her boyfriend, it has been claimed. Zhang Qi, 24, was allegedly forced into the dilapidated building in Jingang in central China's Hubei province, after her mother and father ordered her to split up with her lover in 2009. Despite being told the relationship was over, she tried several times to run away - but her parents told everybody she was mentally ill and being locked up for her own protection, a villager said. Zhang Qi (pictured) was kept in a filthy shed and 'treated like an animal' after her parents locked her up because they did not approve of her boyfriend, it has been claimed . The 24-year-old was allegedly forced into the dilapidated building (pictured) in Jingang in central China's Hubei province, after her mother and father ordered her to split up with her lover in 2009 . Chow Jen, 50, said: 'Her parents are powerful people here and everyone was told not to interfere. 'Everyone knew about the girl in the house. I moved away and only come back to visit occasionally so I don't care about their threats, and that's why I was happy to expose these pictures online after the local authorities refused to do anything.' He said they had claimed that she was mentally unstable and locking her up was for her own good - and that villagers then forced themselves into pretending it was not their business. There has been no official comment on the claims or on the current status of the young woman since the images were posted. Villager Chow Jen said she visited Zhang Qi and found her lying on a pile of straw before posting pictures online . But many copies have been removed by Chinese censors without reason being specified, it has been reported. Chow Jen said: 'Every time I came back for Chinese New Year I went to visit her secretly. 'On my latest visit though I saw her lying on a pile of straw with a couple of blankets and some food around her and I just decided enough was enough. 'Whether what they say about her having mental problems is true or not, she is being treated like an animal here and I'm sick of it so I contacted the police, and then posted the images online.'","Zhang Qi kept in shed in China's Hubei province since 2009, it is claimed .

"A teenage boy has been arrested after teachers found he had a 15in Rambo-style knife in class. The knife, which has a 10in blade - one side razor sharp and the other serrated - was allegedly found in the 15-year-old boy’s bag yesterday at an unnamed school in Croydon, south London. Sergeant Matt Smith, who works as a neighbourhood officer in the Fieldway area of Croydon, posted a photograph of the huge knife and its holster online earlier this week. Huge blade: The knife, which has a 10in blade - one side razor sharp and the other serrated - was found in the boy’s bag yesterday at an unnamed school in Croydon, south London . Under the image, Sgt Smith wrote on Twitter just after 8pm on Monday: ‘The team have charged a teenager for taking this knife into school. He awaits court appearance.’ Sgt Smith did not reveal the  school’s name. The teenager was charged under section 139A of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 for possession of an offensive weapon on school premises. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ‘Police were called on  February 3 to a school in Croydon to reports that staff had confiscated a knife from a student. Officers attended and seized the knife. ‘A 15-year-old boy from Croydon was arrested the following day and was bailed for further enquiries. 'He was charged on February 21 with possession of an offensive weapon on school premises and was bailed to appear at Croydon Youth Court on April 2.’ People found guilty of the offence upon conviction at a magistrates’ court can face a fine or six months in jail, or both. At a crown court, the jail term can go up to four years or a fine, or both.

In one 11-day period last year there were six stabbings in Croydon, with knife arches being brought into a number of the borough’s senior schools in an attempt to combat the problem. Eliza Rebeiro, founder of the Croydon-based organisation Lives Not Knives, told MailOnline: ‘There needs to be more support in schools for young people but specific support for teachers.' She added: 'The whole community needs to work towards preventing such things from happening. We do not know if this young person was being bullied or actually intended to use the knife.’ Tracey Ford, who launched the Jags Foundation after her son's murder, added: ‘We are coming up against youth-on-youth violence very, very regularly in Croydon and other parts of London. ‘More and more incidents are happening but they are not fatal and they are not being reported.

"His many decades of entertaining on stage and screen have earned Sir Bruce Forsyth a considerable fortune. And with six children, nine grandchildren and three great-grandchildren, it's no surprise the entertainer, 87, wants to be able to share as much of the wealth with them as possible. But while he may be known more for his light-hearted banter than political commentary, the former Strictly Come Dancing host has revealed his frustration at the amount that will be taken from his estate in inheritance tax, describing it as 'a bit over the top'. Sir Bruce stands with wife Wilnelia, his daughters Laura (left) and Charlotte and son Jonathan after he was knighted by the Queen . Sir Bruce, pictured with daughters Debbie (left) and Julie (right), says inheritance tax is 'a bit over the top' Sir Bruce, who has a keen interest in politics and once revealed he tapes Prime Minister's Questions each week, also told the Radio Times: 'I think your inheritance should go to your children more than back to the country that you've lived in. 'I'm not saying you don't owe the country something, of course you owe your country a lot for living there all those years. But I think it can be a bit over the top.' Sir Bruce's company, Bruce Forsyth Enterprises, is worth £5.7million and he lives in a house near London worth an estimated £4million. His estate would be exempt from inheritance tax if he leaves everything to his third wife, former Miss World Wilnelia Merced, 57, who is the mother of his only son, JJ. The entertainer had three daughters – Debbie, Julie and Laura – with his first wife Penny Calvert, a former dancer with whom he split in 1973. That year, Sir Bruce married Anthea Redfern, his hostess on The Generation Game. The couple had two daughters, Charlotte and Louisa, but their six-year marriage ended following allegations of infidelity. The entertainer - pictured with daughters Julie (left) and Louisa (right) in 2006 - has a company worth £5.7million and a house worth £4million . Sir Bruce was pictured with his wife, first wife, six children, eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren on Mother's Day 2009. Below, key to who is who. In the interview, Sir Bruce declined to say which political party he supports. But he described David Cameron as 'the most pleasant man' who has 'done a good job'. He also used the interview to hit out at reality TV, saying he was tired of the format. He said: 'I have had enough of it. I don't know how long it's been going on but it's probably well over 10 years.' He added: 'I'd like to see performers playing together, having fun together, entertaining together, instead of this thing that we're caught up in.' Sir Bruce quit Strictly - although he still presents one-off specials - after 11 series and a decade in the job. 'I was beginning to feel a bit stale. It's an awful thing to feel as a performer, that you're not enjoying it as much as you should do and you're not giving as much as you could,' he said. Sir Bruce (pictured left in 1977 and right in 2013) declined to say which political party he supports. But he described David Cameron as 'the most pleasant man' who has 'done a good job' His estate would be exempt from inheritance tax if he leaves everything to his third wife, former Miss World Wilnelia Merced, 57, who is the mother of his only son, JJ . He said of the show's rival, The X Factor: 'I don't watch it because they have singer after singer after singer after singer... and then, after that, they have another singer. 'That, to me, isn't entertainment. It's a very good show, it's produced very, very well and I'm all for giving young people a chance to become big names, but I want more in two hours of entertainment than only singing.' The veteran star is returning to the stage - the London Palladium - with his one man show as part of a three-leg tour in the spring. Asked if going on stage felt better than sex, he replied: 'Well, it's pretty close.' Sir Bruce, who has vowed not to retire, also gave his thoughts on death, saying: 'As I get nearer to it I fear it less because with the tiredness one gets at times, you think, 'Is it just like having a nice long sleep?' I wouldn't say I fear it. 'I think I'll be completely at peace when it does happen to me because I've been so lucky. I've had a wonderful career.' And he said on immigration: 'It should benefit the country, whatever decision is made. It needs sorting out.'

"It is one of the most unlikely links on Earth. A new Nasa satellite has revealed the stunning link between the Sahara desert and the Amazon rainforest. For the first time it showed vast dust clouds travelling high in the atmosphere. Scroll down for video . Nasa's Calipso collects 'curtains' of data that show valuable information about the altitude of dust layers in the atmosphere. The data show that wind and weather pick up on average 182 million tons of dust each year and carry it past the western edge of the Sahara at longitude 15W. This volume is the equivalent of 689,290 semi trucks filled with dust. The dust then travels 1,600 miles across the Atlantic Ocean, though some drops to the surface or is flushed from the sky by rain. Near the eastern coast of South America, at longitude 35W, 132 million tons remain in the air, and 27.7 million tons – enough to fill 104,908 semi trucks – fall to the surface over the Amazon basin. About 43 million tons of dust travel farther to settle out over the Caribbean Sea, past longitude 75W. Scientists have not only measured the volume of dust, they have also calculated how much phosphorus – remnant in Saharan sands from part of the desert's past as a lake bed – gets carried across the ocean from one of the planet's most desolate places to one of its most fertile. 'This is a small world,' said said lead author Hongbin Yu, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Maryland who works at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. 'And we're all connected together.' A new paper published Feb. 24 in Geophysical Research Letters, a journal of the American Geophysical Union, provides the first satellite-based estimate of this phosphorus transport over multiple years. A second paper published online by Yu and colleagues Jan. 8 in Remote Sensing of the Environment provided the first multi-year satellite estimate of overall dust transport from the Sahara to the Amazon. It is the first time a Nasa satellite has quantified in three dimensions how much dust makes this trans-Atlantic journey. This trans-continental journey of dust is important because of what is in the dust, Yu said. Specifically the dust picked up from the Bodélé Depression in Chad, an ancient lake bed where rock minerals composed of dead microorganisms are loaded with phosphorus. Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for plant proteins and growth, which the Amazon rain forest depends on in order to flourish. Nutrients – the same ones found in commercial fertilizers – are in short supply in Amazonian soils. Instead they are locked up in the plants themselves. Fallen, decomposing leaves and organic matter provide the majority of nutrients, which are rapidly absorbed by plants and trees after entering the soil. The data show that wind and weather pick up on average 182 million tons of dust each year and carry it past the western edge of the Sahara at longitude 15W. But some nutrients, including phosphorus, are washed away by rainfall into streams and rivers, draining from the Amazon basin like a slowly leaking bathtub. The phosphorus that reaches Amazon soils from Saharan dust, an estimated 22,000 tons per year, is about the same amount as that lost from rain and flooding, Yu said. The finding is part of a bigger research effort to understand the role of dust and aerosols in the environment and on local and global climate. 'We know that dust is very important in many ways. It is an essential component of the Earth system. 'Dust will affect climate and, at the same time, climate change will affect dust,' said Yu. This volume is the equivalent of 689,290 semi trucks filled with dust. The new dust transport estimates were derived from data collected by a lidar instrument on NASA's Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation, or CALIPSO, satellite from 2007 though 2013. Yu and colleagues focused on the Saharan dust transport across the Atlantic Ocean to South America and then beyond to the Caribbean Sea because it is the largest transport of dust on the planet. Dust collected from the Bodélé Depression and from ground stations on Barbados and in Miami give scientists an estimate of the proportion of phosphorus in Saharan dust. CALIPSO collects 'curtains' of data that show valuable information about the altitude of dust layers in the atmosphere. CALIPSO sends out 20 laser pulses every second, and each is only 20 billionths of a second long. Knowing the height at which dust travels is important for understanding, and eventually using computers to model, where that dust will go and how the dust will interact with Earth's heat balance and clouds, now and in future climate scenarios. This estimate is used to calculate how much phosphorus gets deposited in the Amazon basin from this dust transport. Looking at the data year by year shows that that pattern is actually highly variable. There was an 86 percent change between the highest amount of dust transported in 2007 and the lowest in 2011, Yu said. 'Wind currents are different at different altitudes,' said Trepte. 'This is a step forward in providing the understanding of what dust transport looks like in three dimensions, and then comparing with these models that are being used for climate studies.' Climate studies range in scope from global to regional changes, such as those that may occur in the Amazon in coming years. In addition to dust, the Amazon is home to many other types of aerosols like smoke from fires and biological particles, such as bacteria, fungi, pollen, and spores released by the plants themselves. In the future, Yu and his colleagues plan to explore the effects of those aerosols on local clouds – and how they are influenced by dust from Africa.","Nasa satellite took 3D readings of dust clouds travelling .

"One of Britain's most powerful independent politicians 'wouldn't know the truth if it slapped him in the face,' an electoral fraud trial heard today. Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman, 49, faced the claim at the High Court after he branded a Labour opponent 'institutionally racist' - despite the 'institution' being one man. Rahman is in his second term in the deprived East London borough, where critics claim voters were intimidated, opponents were smeared and ballot papers were forged in last year's election. Scroll down for video . Row: Tower Hamlets Mayor Lutfur Rahman (left) told the High Court Labour opponent John Biggs (right) was 'institutionally racist' - but a barrister told him: 'You wouldn't know the truth if it slapped you in the face' Historic: The High Court is hearing the rare electoral trial, which could result in a new election, mayor Rahman being suspended or banned from office or completely exonerated . The claims led four voters to force a rare electoral fraud trial against Rahman at London's High Court, where he denies all the allegations against him. If commissioner Richard Mawrey QC finds allegations of corruption proved, he has the power to declare the election void. Case: Lutfur Rahman is facing a litany of allegations in a rare High Court electoral fraud trial . Today a row erupted as Rahman was asked whether he stood by comments he made about John Biggs, his  former colleague in the Labour party who became a rival after Rahman left. He attacked Mr Biggs, 57, as being 'institutionally racist' after he said in 2013 that the Mayor was biased in favour of the Bangladeshi community. The London Assembly member had told the BBC: 'All of the Mayor's Cabinet are Bangladeshi and his primary policy focus has been the concerns of one community, the Bangladeshi community'. Rahman said the comments were 'outrageous' and maintained the East End community had been in uproar - despite being unable to cite any specific examples. The court heard his campaign manager, Alibor Choudhury, issued a press release the following February which claimed Mr Biggs was 'Dividing the East End' and insinuated he was a racist. Rahman repeatedly avoided giving direct answers about whether he felt Mr Biggs was a racist, until Commissioner Mr Mawrey, a deputy High Court judge, intervened. The judge asked: 'Is it your view that Mr Biggs is a racist?' Rahman replied: 'What I would say, my Lord, is racism comes in various forms. 'There is direct racism and indirect racism, institutional racism.' The judge repeated the question, to which Rahman replied, 'My personal view is that he is institutionally racist'. The judge was left baffled and replied: 'I don't think an individual person can be institutionally racist'. Francis Hoar, for the voters who have brought the case, agreed - saying: 'A human being can't be an institution, its as simple as that'. Pressed again, Rahman said, 'What I would say, my Lord, is racism comes in various forms, various forms. 'He is not a racist in the sense of skinheads, Dr Martens, cropped hair et cetera. 'He is a highly intelligent person, but racism can also come in very subtle forms.' Both forms of racism cause 'the same devastation', the mayor added. Victory: Rahman after his first election win in 2010. He won another vote against Labour last May . But Mr Hoar said to Rahman, 'You have done nothing but lie. You wouldn't know the truth if it slapped you in the face.' Rahman spoke directly to the judge, responding, 'My future is in the hands of my Lordship'. He said he would not 'throw away' his future by lying. The trial has been brought by four petitioners, Tower Hamlets residents Andrew Erlam, Debbie Simone, Azmal Hussein and Angela Moffat. Mayor Rahman denies any wrongdoing. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","UK's first elected Muslim mayor is subject of a rare electoral fraud trial .

"Alaska has become the third U.S. state to legalize the recreational use of marijuana. This follows a vote last November which saw an 53-47 outcome in favour of legalizing marijuana use by adults in private places . Smoking marijuana in public remains illegal, and police officers in the state's largest city, Anchorage, have been told to remain vigilant. High five: Alaska Cannabis Club CEO Charlo Greene, who famously quit her job as a journalist on live TV last year to support the cause, smokes a joint at the medical marijuana dispensary in Anchorage, Alaska . As of Tuesday, adult Alaskans can keep and use marijuana as well as transport, grow and give it away. A second phase, creating a regulated and taxed marijuana market, will not start until 2016 at the earliest. Alaskans caught smoking weed in public can expect a $100 fine, but the full details regarding what constitutes a violation has yet to be ironed out. Lawmakers have left the question to the alcohol regulatory board, which is planning planned to meet early today to discuss an emergency response. In the meantime, communities across the state have adopted different standards of what constitutes 'smoking in public'. Green day: Adult Alaskans can now use marijuana as well as transport, grow and give it away, but smoking in public remains illegal . Celebrating: Peter Lomonaco, co-founder of the Alaska Cannabis Club, and CEO Charlo Greene roll a joint at their medical marijuana dispensary in Anchorage, Alaska . Anchorage Police Chief Mark Mew said his officers will be strictly enforcing the public smoking ban. He even warned people against smoking on their porches if they live next to a park. Further  north, in North Pole, smoking outdoors on private property will be OK as long as it does not create a nuisance, officials there said. The newly formed  Alaska Cannabis Club, which is having its grand opening on Tuesday in downtown Anchorage, is, unsurprisingly, celebrating the new law with a joint. Its CEO, former television reporter Charlo Greene who famously quit her job with a four-letter walkoff on live television last year to devote her efforts to passing the initiative, is promising to give away weed to paying 'medical marijuana' patients and other 'club members.' Meanwhile, Alaska Native leaders worry that legalization will bring new temptations to communities already confronting high rates of drug and alcohol abuse, domestic violence and suicide. Violation: The full details regarding what constitutes 'smoking in public' has yet to be ironed out so different areas of the state has interpreted the law differently (pictured is the Alaska Cannabis Club in Anchorage) 'When they start depending on smoking marijuana, I don't know how far they'd go to get the funds they need to support it, to support themselves,' said Edward Nick, council member in Manokotak, a remote village of 400 that is predominantly Yup'ik Eskimo. Both alcohol and drug use are prohibited in Nick's village 350 miles southwest of Anchorage, even inside the privacy of villagers' homes. But Nick fears that the initiative, in combination with a 1975 state Supreme Court decision that legalized marijuana use inside homes — could open doors to drug abuse. Initiative backers promised Native leaders that communities could still have local control under certain conditions. Alaska law gives every community the option to regulate alcohol locally. From northern Barrow to Klawock, 1,291 miles away in southeast Alaska, 108 communities impose local limits on alcohol, and 33 of them ban it altogether. But the initiative did not provide clear opt-out language for tribal councils and other smaller communities, forcing each one to figure out how to proceed Tuesday.","As of Tuesday, recreational use of marijuana is legal in Alaska .

"It's a source of sadness to grandparents everywhere – their teenage grandchildren don't spend enough time with them. And it appears that even fashion designer Dame Vivienne Westwood, 73, isn't immune. Dame Vivienne – once the first lady of punk – said she was disappointed that her 17-year-old granddaughter Cora Corré had failed to call or see her. She said Miss Corré had missed her fashion show at the weekend so she could go on a skiing holiday instead. Scroll down for video . Dame Vivienne Westwood (right) said her  granddaughter Cora Corre (left) missed her fashion show to go skiing, pictured at the designer's  Red Label catwalk show last year . Asked about the young model, who made her London Fashion Week debut last year, Miss Westwood revealed Miss Corré had not 'kept in touch'. She added: 'I am very disappointed. I think she is wasting her opportunity. She should use me. I'll be dead and she will think, 'What was that woman talking about?' It is not the first time Dame Vivienne has publicly criticised her granddaughter. In an interview recently she said: 'She's a beautiful girl, but I wish she would use it to stand for something. I would also like to see more of her. She's teenager, she's busy.' The designer with models on the catwalk during her London Fashion week show on Sunday . Daisy Lowe on the catwalk during the Vivienne Westwood Red Label show in Kensington on Sunday . And she said she hoped her granddaughter would ask to read her diary. She said: 'I think my diary is a point of view you wouldn't get anywhere else. I am trying to understand the world we live in. I think she could get a lot from it.' Miss Corré is the child of Agent Provocateur founders Joe Corré, Dame Vivienne's son with the late Malcolm McLaren, and his ex-wife Serena Rees. The couple sold the lingerie chain following their divorce in 2007. Miss Corré, who went to the progressive boarding school Bedales with fellow model Cara Delevingne, made her catwalk debut aged just four in one of her grandmother's fashion shows. She was signed by Next Models last summer, and in September she took a bow with Dame Vivienne at the close of her grandmother's Red Label show.","Vivienne Westwood is 'disappointed' grandchild does not call or see her .

"Roy Stratford, 44, was jailed for four and a half years after police caught up with his scam, but officers were unable to get any of the money back . A conman builder who scammed the elderly out of their life savings and left one woman so shocked she dropped dead from a heart attack has been jailed. Roy Stratford, 44, was given four and a half years behind bars today after charging victims for emergency roof repairs despite having no experience in the roofing trade. In July 2013 he charged one couple £26,000 to fix a leak, but in reality he simply spent an hour nailing a single roll of felt - which can cost as little as £10 - across their roof. Suspecting that they had been conned, the pair, from Uxbridge, north west London, called in a surveyor to inspect the job. When they were told when Stratford had done, the wife dropped dead from a heart attack. In September of the same year Stratford conned another couple in their 80s in Hillingdon, west London, this time charging them £16,000 for 'emergency' repairs to their roof. However, instead of carrying out the repairs he simply painted their chimney stack. When police finally caught up with him they connected him to a series of similar frauds across the country, but were unable to claw back any of the money he tricked out of people. Detective Constable Anji Dawson, of Hillingdon CID, said: 'Stratford is quite simply a cowboy and a coward who targeted and exploited the elderly and vulnerable for his own financial gain. 'He tricked his way into their homes and conned them out of their life savings.' Stratford admitted two counts of fraud by false representation and was jailed at Isleworth Crown Court. Isleworth Crown Court (pictured) heard Stratford charged one couple, in their 80s, £26,000 to fix a leak in their roof, but actually just nailed a roll of felt to it . When they discovered the con, the wife died of a heart attack .","Roy Stratford, 44, posed as a roofer to con elderly couples out of money .

"A premature baby who surprised his parents when he was born 11 weeks during a holiday in New York has finally arrived to his home in the UK. Tiny baby Dax Johnston spent six weeks in the Big Apple after he was born weighing just 3lbs to Lee Johnston, 30, and Katie Amos, 30 who were on a four-day 'trip of a lifetime'. The anxious new parents had to wait for the all clear before they could fly their premature son home after the surprise delivery. But it was another week of careful monitoring at a British hospital before they could finally take Dax back to the family home. Premature baby Dax Johnston is finally home in Burgh-Le-Marsh with parents Lee Johnston and Katie Amos-  seven weeks after his surprise birth in the Big Apple . Mother Katie was ecstatic to finally be settling back in at Burgh-Le-Marsh,in Lincolnshire, with their son. She said: 'This is the day we have been hoping and praying for since the very beginning. 'It's a huge relief to have Dax home, I can't believe how quickly he's come on in just one week - we couldn't be more proud. He now weighs over 6lbs so he's practically doubled in size. 'I feel mentally and physically exhausted so it will be great to sleep in our own bed and get Dax into a routine. 'A few weeks ago we never dreamt we would have him home so soon, it seemed like a lifetime away. The ecstatic parents were delighted to bring their little boy home from Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, Lincolnshire (pictured) where his feeds and weight have been closely monitored after arriving from the US . New mother Katie said she loved New York but admitted she would not be travelling there again if pregnant in the future after the debacle . Tiny baby Dax was just 3lbs when he was born to his British parents during their four-day trip of a lifetime in New York . 'The doctors in New York had originally said the earliest we could leave was on March 10th which was Dax's due date so it really is a miracle. 'Both hospitals in the UK and the US have been incredible and really supportive – we couldn't have asked for better care. 'Now we can finally see him in his nursery which has been ready since before we left for New York.' The couple, who are both personal trainers, had saved for years for their dream city break to the US but never banked on having their child there. Katie said: 'New York has become a very special place to us and we can't wait to take Dax in the future. We feel like we have an American family now, we met so many kind and helpful people whilst we were there. 'The Ronald McDonald House, who helped us with our accommodation, went above and beyond and even threw me a baby shower – it was really emotional when we said out goodbyes. Katie said it was a huge relief to finally have her son home who has almost doubled in weight since he was born 11 weeks premature . After spending the first six weeks of his life as an American citizen, Dax was flown back to the UK via private jet and has now been allowed to come home for the first time . Katie and Lee had been sightseeing at Central Park when Katie unexpectedly went into labour- almost three months early . 'I definitely want more children in the future but as much as I love New York, I've learnt my lesson and won't be travelling there again whilst I'm pregnant.' Katie and Lee had been sightseeing at Central Park when Katie unexpectedly went into labour- almost three months early. Not only did they have the early arrival of their son to contend with, but the hospital initially refused to accept their medical insurance, leaving them with a staggering $130,000 medical bill. Katie said: 'We were beside ourselves with worry, but we had to focus on Dax. When he was born he was so tiny and weighed just 3lbs, he needed all of our attention. 'Luckily around a week later our insurers, Allianz, re-opened after the holidays and confirmed we were covered. 'Dax was a fighter from the beginning though and didn't need any lifesaving operations. 'He had a bit of reflux which is normal and Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA), but they are quite common in premature babies so nothing too serious thankfully. When Dax arrived early his parents had further concern after the hospital initially refused to accept their medical insurance, leaving them with a staggering $130,000 medical bill . Despite being born almost three months before he was due, 'fighter' Dax didn't need any lifesaving operations and has already doubled in weight since the birth . 'The next problem was getting Dax a passport, we just wanted to get him home so we went for an American one as this was considerably faster. 'When we had it in our own hands it was a huge milestone then we just needed the okay for him to fly.' Fortunately for the family they were able to fly home over a month early thanks to having their own private jet. They were given the all clear by Lenox Hospital in New York on the Thursday evening and arrived back in the UK two days later. At Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, Lincolnshire,  his feeds and weight were monitored for a week before he was finally allowed home. Katie said: 'We only had a short window to get Dax home as Pilgrim Hospital had a bed for him but this could change at any minute. From the minute we were told we could leave everything was a blur. 'We had to pack and gather all of our things before being transferred directly to our plane by an ambulance. We landed and took off in total eight times as we had to stop off three times to refuel before we made it back to East Midlands airport. After the family were given the all clear by Lenox Hospital in New York and secured the youngster a passport, he was flown back to the UK on the couple's private medical jet and has now been released from a UK hospital to see his home for the first time . The couple are now looking forward to showingoff Dax son to their family and friends who are yet to meet him . 'It wasn't a private plane like you'd imagine, it was very cramped but it had all the things Dax needed for his big journey home.' The couple are now looking forward to showing off their son to their family and friends who are yet to meet him. Lee said: 'It's great having the little man home, we can finally get him into a bit of a routine. We're now organising a big welcome home party for him to thank everyone. 'It's so nice being able to pick clothes from our whole wardrobe again and have all of our home comforts. The thing me and Katie have been looking forward to most is being able to sleep in our bed with Dax by our side. 'He seems to be settling in really well so I've now gone back to work as someone needs to pay the bills. 'We couldn't be happier, Dax is coming on in leaps and bounds and has surpassed all of the doctor's expectations. Our next mission is for Dax to get big enough so we can take him back to meet his new adopted American family. 'We have promised to keep in touch with all of the people who helped him on his journey, and they're all excited for him to go back.'","Baby Dax finally came home seven weeks after he was born in New York .

"A young female teacher who began an affair with a sixth-former at one of Britain’s top boarding schools has been banned from the classroom for life. Ruth Vaughan, who was 24 at the time, first kissed the pupil and exchanged phone numbers with him in June 2013 during his leavers’ ball at the £30,000-a-year Oakham School in Rutland. Although she did not teach the boy, she got to know him when she helped with the co-ed school’s cadet force, a professional conduct panel hearing was told. The sixth-former – named only as ‘Student A’ – claimed he began a sexual relationship with Miss Vaughan in July 2013. Banned: Ruth Vaughan is no longer allowed to teach after having an affair with an 18-year-old . However Miss Vaughan, a newly qualified design and technology teacher who started at the school in September 2012, insisted that she did not have sex with Student A until his second week of university. Miss Vaughan, who gave evidence to the hearing via videolink from Saudi Arabia where she now lives, accepted that the relationship was inappropriate even though the teenager had left the school, and expressed regret at her actions. She was found guilty of unacceptable professional conduct and banned indefinitely from teaching in any school, sixth-form college, youth accommodation or children’s home in England. Alan Meyrick, who chaired the hearing in Coventry, said: ‘The panel considered that the relationship with Student A was borne out of the position of trust that Miss Vaughan was in as a teacher in Student A’s school – despite him having recently left.’ He added: ‘Miss Vaughan’s obligations would not have changed overnight. This was indicated by the school policy preventing social media interactions with former pupils until September 1 after the pupil left the school. ‘If such interaction was prevented, it is apparent that a relationship would also have been a serious breach of the school’s policies, practices and ethos.’ The hearing was also told that Miss Vaughan bought two other underage Oakham students alcoholic drinks in a pub. But the panel did not consider the action to be blameworthy, as she was unaware that they were under the age of 18. Mr Meyrick went on to say: ‘There was no indication that Student A was vulnerable.’ But he added: ‘I am satisfied that the conduct of Miss Vaughan fell significantly short of the standards expected of the profession.’ Work: Vaughan was a design and technology teacher at Oakham School, a £30,000-a-year boarding school . One of the most distinguished schools in the country, Oakham has a long and noble history. It was founded by Archdeacon Robert Johnson in 1584, and later became the first public school to go online in 1995. The school - whose Latin motto in English means 'And, like runners, they pass on the torch of life' - has a proud history of sporting sucess. Notable former pupils in the world of cricket include England's Stuart Broad and former national team captain Percy Chapman, who skippered the team between 1926 and 1931. The school has also produced several rugby union stars such as former England player Lewis Moody, current national player Tom Croft, Gloucester's Rob Cook and Leicester Tigers' Matt Smith. Crista Cullen, who was part of Team GB's bronze-winning hockey team at the London 2012 Olympic Games, also attended the school. Other noted former pupils in the world of showbiz and entertainment include Jamiroquai frontman Jay Kay, comedian Miles Jupp and actor Matthew Macfadyen.","Ruth Vaughan hooked up with 18-year-old Oakham pupil at a leavers' ball .

"It may be known as the red planet, but sunsets on Mars are blue. Nasa has released a new video on the social media site Vine showing the sun dipping towards the Martian horizon, captured by its exploratory rover Opportunity. The time-lapse video of the eerie sunset was created by piecing together images taken by Opportunity. The images show a darker, dustier sky than here on Earth that perhaps loses some of the romance that often accompanies sunset on our own planet. Two strange, cloud-like plumes reaching high above the surface of Mars have created a stir among scientists. The plumes were seen rising to altitudes of over 155 miles (250 km) above the same region of Mars, and could help explain what makes up the Martian atmosphere. It is thought that they could be made of particles of water or carbon dioxide or perhaps an aurora shimmering above the poles. Past surveillance by scientific orbiters have suggested Terra Cimmeria to have a 'strip' with a strong but localised magnetic field. If this is the case, the Martian 'aurora' would be a remarkable 1,000 times brighter than its  equivalent on Earth. But 'both explanations defy our current understanding of Mars' upper atmosphere', scientists admit. And rather than turning the sky a deep orange, as happens on Earth, the setting sun gives the sky a deep blue tinge. Although much of the surface of Mars is a deep red colour, it is this thick dust that also turns the sunset blue. However, Dr John Bridges, a planetary scientist at the University of Leicester who studies Mars, warned that the cameras on the Opportunity rover may not be conveying the true image. He said: 'We do have to be a little careful with the colour produced by the cameras on this rover as they are a false colour image. 'What is very striking though is how much smaller the sun appears compared to here on Earth. 'Taking images like this can teach us a great deal about the atmosphere on Mars. 'Most of the dust is in the troposphere, which is about 40km up on Mars. 'There is a lot of effort to find out how high up dust clouds can get up on Mars - particularly after some cloud-like plumes were spotted that appear to be much higher in the atmosphere than we thought dust can go.' The sun appears just five eighths of the size it does on Earth when viewed from Mars while thick dust in the atmosphere filters out the red light from the sun, giving sunsets a deep blue colour, as pictured above . Scientists say sunset on Mars would have a blue light, however, as the red dust in the atmosphere filters out much of the red light from the sun. As the sun dips lower in the sky, its light has to travel through the lower layers of the atmosphere where the dust is thicker. On Earth our own atmosphere scatters blue light creating the red and orange shades that light up the sky at sun down. It is not the first time Nasa has shown the world what a sunset on Mars would look like and it released a longer video in 2010. Opportunity has seen around 3940 sunsets since it arrived on Mars. Scientists use the cameras of the Opportunity rover, shown above in an artists impression, to study the sunsets on the red planet to help them quantify how much ice and dust is in the atmosphere of the red planet . From the surface of the red planet the sun appears about five eighths of the size it is when seen from the Earth. The red planet receives just 40 per cent of the light we experience on Earth, meaning the sky appears much darker as the sun begins to fall towards the horizon. However, twilight can continue for up to two hours after the sun has set - far longer than on Earth - as sunlight is scattered around to the night side of the planet by the abundance of dust high in the atmosphere. The average length of a day on Mars is about 24 hours and 37 minutes. Scientists running the mars rovers take occassional images of the Martian sunset to help them determine how high into the atmosphere the Martian dust billows. They low angle of the light also makes it easier for them to see ice clouds that can form in the sky. At 141,610,000 miles from the sun, the average temperature on the surface of Mars is around -66°C (-87°F). Nasa's Opportunity rover has traveled close to the same distance as an Olympic marathon during its mission as can be seen in the image above which charts its path across the Martian surface over the past 11 years .","Nasa's Opportunity rover captured the sunset from the surface of Mars .

"A plus-sized athlete who wrote a blog post about curvy competitors has hit back at critics who say she is promoting obesity. Leah Gilbert, from Newcastle - 160 kilometres north of Sydney - in New South Wales, trains for half marathons and weighs in at 90 kilograms. The fitness instructor penned a piece for fitness blog Sportette called 'I'm Plus Size and I'm an Athlete' with the purpose of trying to change change people's perception of trimness equalling fitness. Leah Gilbert, 36, is a fitness trainer who penned a blog post called 'I'm Plus Size and I'm an Athlete' But along with the positive reactions she was criticised for encouraging people to be obese, which Ms Gilbert insists was not her goal. The 36-year-old has addressed the backlash on her blog, Body Positive Athletes. The response has been shared more than 2,000 times on Facebook so far. In it Ms Gilbert acknowledge with the good feedback comes the negative as well. 'There was the anticipated argument that in being satisfied with how my body functioned for me at my racing weight of 90 kilograms I was actively promoting obesity,' she wrote. The Newcastle woman (left) said big, strong and power players - such as NRL player George Rose (right) - were not accused of promoting obesity . 'In discussing the history of... weight divisions in both running and triathlon, I was glorifying a group of people who were too ""lazy"" to work hard to achieve normal weight and wanted it ‘easy’ when it came to competition,' she said. Ms Gilbert questioned why male athletes did not face the same criticism as their female counterparts. 'There is a lot of double standards sometimes as far as what strengths are celebrated in males sports that aren't celebrated as much in female sports by society,' she told Daily Mail Australia. On her blog, Ms Gilbert expands: 'When a younger boy presents a larger form, there tends to be (albeit stereotypical) conversations around what a great prop or front rower he would make. 'Big, strong, powerful [NRL] players such as Paul Gallen and ""Big Georgie Rose"" become their role models. A number of T20 Big Bash stars such as Craig Simmons also present a larger form and are respected for their strength and power, not to mention our top rugby union players such as Benn Robinson. The blog post garnered a positive response but also attracted negative ones, which Ms Gilbert has addressed in a new piece . The endurance athlete questioned why male athletes did not face the same criticism as their female counterparts . 'Funnily enough, I don't think I have heard many of these players questioned over their roles in the promotion of obesity.' Despite some of the negative feedback, Ms Gilbert said she was happy her message had been spread. 'The result that I'm seeing from me working on message is people are getting more active,' she said. 'The message I've been working on is creating a positive response among most people and I just think our health situation is at such a crisis level that we should try some other approaches rather than [fat] shaming. 'I actually have some good statistics from the National Eating Disorder Collaboration that say why it's good to give our adolescent girls in the shapes and size in their role models. 'In one of their recent reports, 70 per cent of adolescent of females said they had some sort of body dissatisfaction.' Ms Gilbert also cited a Mission Australia report that said body image was the third biggest concern for teenagers. 'It makes me really passionate about getting a range of role models of all different shapes and sizes and abilities so we can keep them in sport,' she said. 'They should view their body from a functional perspective than as an aesthetic. It takes them from a small waist point of view to a ""what I need to do to perform in my chosen sport"" view.'","Leah Gilbert penned a blog post about being plus-sized and an athlete .

"The shocking moment a driver was forced off the road when he was cut off by a lorry has been captured in a terrifying dash-cam video. Jim McLaughlin was driving his van to work when a huge articulated truck pulled into the road ahead of him, apparently without checking for oncoming traffic. He immediately took evasive action and swerved his vehicle onto the grassy verge, coming to a stop as the lorry continued down the road without stopping to check Mr McLaughlin was unhurt. Scroll down for video . Danger: Jim McLaughlin captured video of himself being forced to take evasive action when a lorry, pictured here approaching from the right, pulled out in front of him . Sudden: The lorry pulled out onto the road in the Scottish Highlights and cut Mr McLaughlin off . Video captured by a camera mounted on the van's dashboard shows that the lorry driver would have had a clear view of the road before pulling out. Mr McLaughlin, who was travelling from his home in Inverness to his fruit and veg business in the Highland town of Tain, has now posted the video on YouTube in a bid to shame the driver. 'I was just driving along listening to music on my way to work and I saw the guy coming from the right side, but I assumed he would come to a stop,' the 52-year-old said. 'But then I just saw the truck come right across and nearly crash into me. I thought I was dust. Everything seemed to happen very fast and incidents like this have happened at this junction in the past. Shock: The lorry was going at a high speed and did not appear to see Mr McLaughlin's van . Emergency: The van driver swerved out of the way of the lorry, dislodging snow from the roof of his vehicle . 'After the incident I drove after him and he stopped in a lay-by three or four miles on where I explained to him that he nearly killed me and after that he apologised. 'I ride a motorbike too and people do it all the time because they're harder to see, but I don't know how you can miss a van. 'The whole point of putting the video online is because people have been trying to get something done about that junction. 'I have seen so many close shaves there myself and you draw your teeth in, but I think this one was the closest. It is happening every week and someone will eventually get killed.' Visibility: Mr McLaughlin's windscreen was hard to see through as he swerved onto a grassy verge . Blind; The lorry ignored the near-miss accident and simply carried on down the road . Local councillor Maxine Smith said: 'I have seen the video and it is just terrible. The thing is, there are near misses at this junction all the time. 'I get emails weekly about this and fortunately this driver saw it coming and took evasive action, which was lucky because there was a lorry coming up behind as well. 'I think with evidence like this it is crucial that people send in their accounts of things like this happening.' A spokesman for Police Scotland confirmed they were aware of the incident. G A McKenzie, the company which owns the lorry, refused to comment on the video.","Jim McLaughlin was driving his van to work in the Scottish Highlands .

"Workers cut down a 60-year-old tree in a couple's garden after misreading a map and trespassing on their property. Gary Taplin arrived home to find a pile of logs where his 30ft false acacia had been standing for six decades outside the house in Witham, Essex. He is now planning to sue the housing association which wrongly chopped down the historic tree. Anger: Gary Taplin arrived home to find that a 60-year-old tree in his garden had been chopped down . Attractive: The tree, circled, had stood next to Mr Taplin's home since the 1950s . It is thought that workmen were supposed to be targeting three younger trees which stand a few yards from the family's home on a patch of communal land. But they apparently read the map wrongly and stepped over a small fence to enter Mr Taplin's private garden. The 52-year-old engineer said: 'My wife cried because it was so shocking and upsetting. 'It was a lovely old tree. It gave us privacy and was a real feature of the house and garden. I used to prune it and look after it. It was such a shock to see it had gone. Demolished: Workers initially cut down the tree and left the remains in Mr Taplin's garden . Error: The contractors apparently meant to cut down the trees standing on communal land, but instead stepped over a fence into Mr Taplin's garden . 'I have asked for an explanation on how they got it wrong. All the trees were marked with numbers so I can't understand how they got the wrong one. 'They haven't only cut down our tree but they were trespassing by being on our land without our knowledge or permission. 'There were still tree parts in our garden nine days on - they should have been cleared away.' Father-of-three Mr Taplin, who has lived in the house for 28years with his wife Julia, fears the value of the property will be affected by the loss of the tree, and is planning to take legal action over the blunder. Devastated: Mr Taplin and his wife Julia were upset about the loss of their 60-year-old tree . Damage: The homeowners say their garden is not the same without the majestic false acacia . Greenfields Community Housing Ltd has admitted its contractors cut the tree down by mistake and apologised to the family. A spokesman said: 'Greenfields and our contractors have offered our sincere apologies to Mr Taplin and his family for the removal of the tree.

"A quick-thinking diving instructor used plastic sandals as a makeshift splint after a woman drove a quad bike off a 60ft cliff and shattered her leg. Melanie Simmonds, 31, from Farnborough, Hampshire, was on a cheap holiday with her boyfriend Jay Buckley in Kefalonia, Greece, when they decided to hire the vehicle instead of taking a taxi. But the former care worker said that while she was in the driving seat the wheels locked and she was unable to steer, leaving them hurtling down the cliff, stopping short of the water's edge. Melanie Simmonds, pictured with her then boyfriend Jay Buckley, on the quad bike which they later crashed . She frantically rung the last number in her phone which went through to the driving school and one of the instructors - Peter Tovey - was able to rush to their side. Miss Simmonds said: 'I'd been wearing cropped jeans and underneath my bones jutted through bloodied flesh on my left knee, right shin and ankle. 'The diving instructor was with us in minutes using his flip flops as splints on my shattered bones. 'When the ambulance arrived I was put on a stretcher and winched slowly up the cliff face. It took 30 minutes and felt like I was screaming forever.' Miss Simmonds in hospital after the incident in which she suffered a broken nose and hand a multiple fractures to her legs . Plaster casts were put on her legs in a Greek hospital soon after she crashed off a 60ft cliff on the quad bike . Miss Simmonds had suffered multiple breaks in both legs, a broken finger and fractured nose in the accident, which happened in June 2010. Mr Buckley, who she has since split from, sustained only minor injuries. The crash was not deemed anyone's fault but the couple were not covered for quad biking in their insurance. She explained: 'Taxis were so expensive so I suggested we hire a quad bike to get back. They were so cheap to hire for the day. 'We'd seen other people do it and they looked fine. We both strapped on our helmets. I was in the driving seat with Jay holding on to my hips. 'I was enjoying the scenery of the stunning coastal road with a steep drop down with sheer cliffs on one side. The crash happened in Kefalonia, Greece, in June 2010 during a cheap holiday break for the care worker . Miss Simmonds during a dive on the trip. The last number she had called was the driving school so when she crashed she called them and an instructor was sent to rescue her and her ex-boyfriend Jay Buckley . The diving instructor took off his flip-flops and made a makeshift splint to support her leg until emergency services could arrive and airlift her to hospital . 'But as we drove along, I spotted a sharp corner up ahead. I turned the handlebars into it. But as I tried to turn out again, the wheels seemed to lock. 'I was helpless as we plummeted off the cliff. If I hadn't been wearing my big camera bag on my back I think I would have been paralysed or worse, as it protected my back. 'The next thing I knew I was lying at the bottom of the cliff on the shore, with the bike in the sea and water lapping at my arm - if I'd landed a yard away I would have drowned.' She was told that Greek doctors could only do the minimum to help and they pulled her bones back together and gave her painkillers. After 10 days she was allowed to leave but needed to remain stretchered. Miss Simmonds said: 'Getting back to the UK was a nightmare. I had to spend 16 hours in an ambulance and we reserved nine seats on the plane back.' The return trip took two days and cost £8,000, which was 26 times more than the £300 trip initially cost them. Her nose was split in two in the incident and she underwent a number of operations to fix it. Pictured after her second surgery . Miss Simmonds was left in a wheelchair (right) for six months and had to have her leg put in a brace (left) A doctor told her she will never regain full strength in her legs again. Pictured right, Miss Simmonds getting ready to dive while on the holiday that left her in hospital . She had to have a metal rod through the whole bone in a second operation, which left her right leg bruised . After landing at Heathrow airport, Miss Simmonds was taken to Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey. She said: 'Family rushed to see me and I'd never been more pleased to see them. Doctors found I had multiple breaks in both legs, a broken finger and a broken nose. 'I needed a metal rod in my right leg, a plate in my left knee and another in my nose. The doctors there were absolutely brilliant. 'I was just so grateful. I've never appreciated the NHS so much.' After 11 days in hospital, she was allowed home but still needed seven operations.

Miss Simmonds (left) cycled 250 miles in a charity race for the Halow Project, which she now works for, in May 2013 after recovering from her accident . 'I was in a wheelchair for six long months. Doctors said I'd never regain full strength in my legs. I could walk but not run long distances. 'People told me I was lucky to be alive, but it didn't feel like it. I left my job and spent my days at home feeling low.' A year after the accident, Miss Simmonds started working with The Halow Project, a local charity for young, disabled people and now has a new partner Craig Ifaia, 31. Miss Simmonds said: 'Looking back, I wouldn't change what happened. I believe everything happens for a reason. Without it, I wouldn't be who I am today. 'I wouldn't have a job I love, or be confident that I can take on anything. It's been a long road, but I refuse to let that holiday disaster shatter my dreams.'","Melanie Simmonds, 31, was on cheap holiday in Greece with her boyfriend .

"Figures show parents are shelling out hundreds of pounds to buy school uniforms, with many families ending up in debt as a result. Stock photo . Parents are shelling out hundreds of pounds to buy school uniforms, with many families ending up in debt or forced to cut back on essentials to pay for them, research has shown. A report by the Children’s Society discovered families with school-age children spend an average of £316 a year for a child at a state secondary and £251 for one at a state primary. The poll of 1,000 parents found that around £2.1billion is spent a year on school clothes in the UK – £1.3billion more than the amount mothers and fathers think would be ‘reasonable’. But nearly 800,000 pupils go to school in ill-fitting uniform as their parents cannot afford to buy new items, while 400,000 have been sent home for wearing ‘incorrect’ clothes. School uniform policies risk dividing pupils into the 'haves and have-nots', leaving those without the right kit at risk of bullying and embarrassment, the Children's Society report warned. The findings, based on a poll of around 1,000 parents, found that 95% of mothers and fathers think school uniform costs are 'unreasonable'. Shoes were the most expensive item at £56 on average for secondary school children and £53 for primary age youngsters, followed by coats and bags (£55 for secondary and £44 for primary). Blazers set parents with secondary school children back £42 on average, and £32 for those with youngsters at primary school. An analysis by the charity suggests that nearly 800,000 pupils go to school in poorly-fitting uniform because their parents cannot afford to keep buying new items, while a further 400,000 have been sent home for wearing 'incorrect' clothes. And around a quarter of a million have had their school chosen based on the cost of its uniform. One parent said: 'My oldest daughter, they sent her home and said she wasn't allowed to come back until she had the correct shoes. So then I had to write a letter to say that we'll be able to get some in a week or so, I didn't have any money.' And another told researchers: 'School uniform is a constant source of anxiety. I am not ashamed of being poor but I always want my children to look as well cared for as others. I go without so my children can always have what is needed.' The research found that around £2.1billion is spent a year on school clothes in the UK. Stock photo . 'In many cases, parents have to cut back on other essentials in order to afford uniform costs,' the report says. 'More than one million children live in families that have cut back spending on food or other basic essentials as a result of the cost of school uniforms. More than half a million are living in families that have got into debt as a result of uniform costs.' One of the key reasons for high uniform spending are policies that force parents to buy specific items from specialist shops. Families who had to shop in a specific place saw costs pushed up by £48 on average for secondary school children and £93 for primary school pupils. According to the Children's Society's calculations, in total parents pay around £2.1 billion a year on school clothes - around £1.3 billion more than the amount mothers and fathers think would be 'reasonable'. Overall, private school uniform costs were the highest, the report found, followed by grammar schools and local council-run state schools. The charity is calling for Government guidance, which says uniform should be affordable, to be made statutory and reissued to schools. The Government should also look at capping the cost of uniforms, it adds. Lily Caprani, of the Children's Society, said: 'We know that children whose parents cannot afford the cost of specialist uniforms face punishment and bullying for not having exactly the right clothes or kit. It's time for the Government to introduce legally binding rules to stop schools from making parents pay over the odds for items available only at specialist shops.' The Opinium Research poll surveyed 1,007 UK parents of school age children between January 23 and 27.","Poll found around £2.1billion a year is spent on school clothes in the UK .

"When it came to choosing the perfect ensemble for a visit to Dents glove factory in Wiltshire, there was one accessory the Duchess of Cornwall just had to wear – a pair of Dents gloves. Ever the diplomat, Camilla arrived at the factory, which is a short journey from Highgrove, with her hands encased in a cosy black leather pair. She was there to see the glove-making process in action and if she couldn’t resist skating quickly past a display featuring the skins of peccary pigs used to make the gloves, it was a different story when Ruby the dog appeared. The Duchess of Cornwall wears a black pair of Dent gloves for an official visit to the factory today . Camilla presents a long-service certificate (and a canine cake) to Ruby the rescue dog at Dents glove factory . The pet, which belongs to Dent’s chief executive, Deborah Moore, had been brought to the factory to meet the Duchess and take part in a reception for those with a long history of service. Ruby, who has been coming to the factory each day for more than a decade, joined other long-standing members of staff and, like them, was presented with a special certificate. Camilla, the owner of several pet dogs herself, couldn’t resist crouching down to give the dog a pat and exclaimed: ‘How very well behaved she is!’ as she did so. Thirteen-year-old Ruby, a black Labrador, was then given a slice of a specially made doggy cake by the Duchess, which the pet swiftly wolfed down. Good dog! Camilla pats Ruby on the head as he tucks into his special canine cake . Hands on: The Duchess gets to grips with a glove cutting machine at Dents factory . Resplendent in navy blue tartan, the Duchess chatted animatedly as she swept through the museum. She was shown by a member of factory staff, right, a skin from a peccary pig, which is used to make the finest leather . The moment came at the end of a visit which had also seen the Duchess tour the factory’s museum, accompanied by local staff – some of whom have been working at the factory for more than 50 years. Given the factory’s long history of producing gloves for royalty and famous names alike, it was far from being an onerous one and, as with the Duchess herself, the accessories remain popular with the royal family – in particular, the Queen. One of Her Majesty’s pairs, the ones she wore to the 1953 Coronation, were on display, as was another pair once owned by Queen Victoria. Further pairs once belonged to racing driver Stirling Moss, Trafalgar victor Admiral Horatio Nelson and, oldest of all, Elizabethan explorer and courtier, Sir Walter Raleigh. After the Duchess visited the factory, she headed over to the offices of Community First - a Wiltshire based initiative that aims to tackle disadvantage, where she was presented with a bouquet of flowers (left). Shortly before she headed into the building, Camilla was caught up in a strong gust of wind (right) Ever the professional, the Duchess continued to smile as her hair was swept sideways by the blustery weather . The Duchess, who was making the first of two visits in Wiltshire today, certainly appeared to enjoy it and chatted animatedly as she swept through the museum, resplendent in a navy blue dress. Inspecting a pair of gloves dating from 1507, she expressed her amazement over the length of the fingers – a big fashion trend in the early Stuart period. ‘I can’t get over how long they are!’ she said. Another pair of gloves picked up by the Duchess belonged to Admiral Nelson, although in a grisly twist, they still had blood on them. But with another engagement to attend, Camilla soon had to depart – this time bound for Devizes where a visit to Community First’s new offices awaited.

Founded in 1965, Community First is a Wiltshire based initiative that aims to tackle disadvantage and improve the quality of life for people living in the county. Camilla's day wasn't entirely without incident, however, with the February breeze getting the better of her as she arrived at the Beacon Business Centre in Hopton Park, Devizes. Luckily, the Duchess appears to have deployed the Queen's trick of having tiny weights added to the hem of her skirts and was spared what could have been an embarrassing moment. Camilla looks on as Janet Jay, right, inspects a just-made leather glove . Dents was founded by master craftsman John Dent in Worcester, England, in 1777. Thanks to his meticulous workmanship and eye for creativity, Dents soon developed a reputation as a leading leather glove company. From the beginning, it used only the very finest English leather and perfected techniques of cut and fit which became world famous as ‘Dents’ secret fit’. Its gloves and accessories were soon being sought by the famous and fashionable in Paris, New York, Montreal and Sydney. Now sold in more than 30 different countries around the world, the gloves remain popular in every strata of society and make regular appearances on TV, most notably on ITV drama Mr Selfridge. They are also the glove of choice for Daniel Craig’s James Bond and last appeared on the silver screen during Skyfall. As Camilla’s visit, and the opening of the factory by Princess Anne four years ago, reveals, the gloves are almost enormously popular with the royal family. Dents also produces the coronation gloves, including those worn by George VI and Elizabeth II.","The Duchess toured the Dents glove factory in Warminster .

"The mother of a British soldier who is returning home after going to  fight  ISIS in Syria says she is relieved that her 'Rambo' is safe - but admits he has been 'bloody stupid'. The 19-year-old private, who is serving with the 2nd Battalion of The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment, was being flown home last night after being found near the border between Syria and Iraq. Last night, his mother said she was 'extremely angry' with her son, but dubbed him 'Rambo' after saying he was brave. The mother of the 19-year-old soldier who  left  to fight against ISIS has called her son 'bloody stupid' Rambo is a film series about a troubled Vietnam War veteran, played by Sylvester Stallone. She said: 'Rambo is coming home. I've asked them to leave me in a room with him for two minutes. It's the same scenario as when your child runs in the road and you grab them and smack them for doing something so bloody stupid. 'I'm extremely angry with him, but for someone to do that shows they have balls.' It was reported on Thursday that the teenager had left his base after telling his family he was joining the Kurdish Peshmerga in their battle against the extremist group because 'these guys need our help'. The soldier, from East Sussex, was in Dubai on leave from his base in Cyprus when he decided to travel to the war-torn country. He was the first British soldier to have gone to fight against the terror group and his disappearance fuelled fears that he could have been a prime beheading target for Islamist jihadists. But he was reportedly found 'safe and well' near the front line in Kurdistan after his fellow rebel fighters revealed his location. Diplomats then got in touch with Peshmerga forces, who arranged for him to be dropped off at the British Consul in Erbil, where an officer from his regiment was waiting. It is not known whether or not he will face formal disciplinary action, as he was on leave at the time of his disappearance, but if he is charged with going AWOL or desertion he could be sentenced to detention or imprisonment. Desertion carries a maximum sentence of life in prison if the serviceman involved is judged to have been avoiding active service, while going AWOL or failing to attend for duty can bring a two-year sentence. However, hundreds of troops go AWOL each year without facing any disciplinary action, and according to the latest available figures the most severe sentence handed out for desertion in recent years was 18 months at the military detention centre in Colchester. The private, who disappeared last week, is serving with the 2nd Battalion of The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment . Pictured: Peshmerga fighters outside Mosil, Iraq. A number of foreign fighters have come from around the world to join Kurdish forces in the battle against ISIS . Defence Secretary Michael Fallon had yesterday told the Commons that the serving soldier, who has not been identified, had been found and was being returned to his unit. He said: 'The House may also want to know the soldier reported as missing last week has now been located and is being returned to his unit.' The MoD had previously said they would not send police to the Middle East looking for him. Yesterday, a defence source said: 'We are just grateful to have him back at the moment.' The soldier left his base after sending a message to his family saying: 'I'm with other British people and a Canadian at the moment. I don't know how to explain it to you but I really want and need to do this and I will be safe. He added: 'I have good skills and I can speak the language, I can help these people and help with this fight. I will get in trouble for being AWOL, but it's minor and no prison sentence.' The private joined up at the age of 16 after leaving school and had reportedly been learning Arabic. He was said to have once shared a barracks with murdered Fusilier Lee Rigby. He is understood to have visited the area with the military for a training exercise before he decided to return to fight. The serviceman, who has not been named for security reasons, was stationed in Cyprus and travelled to the region via Dubai while on annual leave . He is thought to have been fighting alongside a group called Lions Of Rojava, who have Americans, Canadians and other Britons among their number. The soldier reportedly posted a picture online over the weekend showing him standing next to Canadian ex-serviceman Brandon Glossop. In the post, he referred to Glossop as his 'wingman' and, in a message to his family, added: 'I'm all safe guys.' The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment are based at the Tower of London, where the soldier will return to find out whether he faces a court martial. In December it emerged that two former British soldiers had travelled to Syria to fight against ISIS after feeling 'compelled' to take up arms following the murder of aid volunteer Alan Henning. News of the soldier came as the Defence Secretary was urged to clarify exactly what Britain's plan is for the campaign against ISIS in Iraq. Labour MP John Woodcock said it was troubling defence chiefs had failed to outline the objectives for the campaign against ISIS, also known as Isil, in recent evidence to a Commons committee. Speaking at Commons defence questions, the Barrow and Furness MP Mr Woodcock said: 'Do you think it is acceptable none of the service chiefs who gave evidence to the defence committee's recent inquiry was willing or able to articulate the UK's objective or strategic plan in Iraq? What is our plan exactly?' Mr Fallon replied: 'Our plan in Iraq is very simple - it is to disrupt threats to the UK mainland and our interests overseas, secondly it is as part of an international coalition to defeat Isil, including discrediting its violent ideology. 'It is thirdly to mitigate the impact of Isil and other violent extremist groups on the stability of the region as a whole.' It is understood the British soldier joined a group called the Lions Of Rojava, who boast, 'It is better to live one day as a Lion that a thousand days as a sheep.' They are the foreign fighters who have travelled to Syria to fight, not for jihad, but on behalf of the Kurdish communities who are defending their communities from the advance of Sunni Islamists. Just as hundreds of young Europeans have gone to fight for the radical Islamists of Islamic State, so increasing numbers are now travelling to fight for their avowed enemies, the Kurds. Westerners in Kurdistan: A photo of Western fighters from the Lions Of Rojava Facebook page . Jordan Matson, a former U.S. soldier now with Syrian Kurds' People's Protection Units (YPG), operates The Lions Of Rojava Facebook page openly calling for volunteers to travel to join the fight. Just as many of the Islamic State's foreign volunteers have been drawn from the ranks of Sunni Muslim youth worldwide, many of the initial YPG volunteers have come from the Kurdish diaspora. Last August a hairdresser from South London was reported to be the first Briton to travel to fight alongside Kurdish forces. Ethnic Kurd Mama Kurda from Croydon, 26, travelled to Iraq to join the Kurdish peshmerga as they desperately tried to halt Islamic State's lightning advance. But since then many others have been inspired to take up arms against Islamic State, perhaps also inspired by the radical socialist experiment underway in the Kurdish autonomous region of Rojava. Brothers in arms: Briton Jamie Read, right, with American Jordan Matson, who is also fighting in Syria . Inspired by the social ecologist and anarchist Murray Bookchin it has adopted a vision of 'libertarian municipalism' calling for Kurds to create free, self-governing communities. Last October it was reported that a currently serving British Royal Marine had been questioned by police on suspicion he was travelling to fight with Kurdish militias during his leave. The 22-year-old Commando was quizzed after he prepared to fly from California on a one-way ticket to Turkey. He was suspected of being in contact with Kurdish militant groups. Two women, Canadian Jew Gill Rosenberg, 31, and Danish Kurd Joanna Palani, 20, have also reportedly travelled to fight with the Kurds, inspired perhaps by the images of female fighters on the front line against Islamic State terrorists. It is perhaps the only place in the world where women are fighting on the front line of armed conflict. There are also claims that a number of European biker gangs have travelled to Syria and are helping to assist the resistance. Leaders of the Cologne-based Median Empire Motorcycle Club, which has strong Kurdish links, have posted images of their German riders posing in the city - some of them carrying weapons. The news came just days after three members of a notorious motorcycle gang from the Netherlands were told they had not committed any crime by travelling to Kobani to join the fight against ISIS.","Soldier's mother dubbed her son 'Rambo' but said he was 'bloody stupid'

"An Idaho lawmaker provoked ridicule after asking if a swallowed camera could be used to conduct a remote gynaecological exam on a pregnant woman. Republican State Representative Vito Barbieri made the bizarre remark as the House State Affairs Committee heard nearly three hours of testimony on a bill that would ban doctors from prescribing abortion-inducing medication via video conference or phone call. Dr Julie Madsen was testifying in opposition to the bill when Mr Barbieri asked if a swallowed camera could be used for a remote exam. Idaho Representative Vito Barbieri, who provoked ridicule after asking if a swallowed camera could be used to conduct a remote gynaecological exam on a pregnant woman . And when Dr Madsen replied that it would be impossible because swallowed pills do not end up in the vagina, Mr Barbieri added: 'Fascinating. That makes sense', amid the crowd's laughter. The committee ended up approving the bill 13-4 on a party-line vote and now it will go to the House floor for a full vote. Mr Barbieri, who sits on the board of a crisis pregnancy centre in northern Idaho, voted in favour of the legislation. Under the bill, abortion-inducing medication would not be able to be administered through telemedicine - which does not currently happen in Idaho, and requires doctors to make 'all reasonable effort' to schedule a follow-up visit. The bill is also backed by the anti-abortion group Idaho Choose Life. Anti-abortion advocates argue that the bill will protect women who may have an adverse reaction to abortion medication. Those opposed say that the bill is an attempt to restrict abortions, pointing to women living in rural areas where access to clinics is already limited. The measure is one of several abortion-related bills Idaho lawmakers are considering this legislative session. Meanwhile in the Idaho Senate, lawmakers are considering a bill that would require doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a local hospital. Republican Representative Linda Bateman said: 'Children have no way to really challenge the forces that harm them and unborn children are especially susceptible to harm. Mr Barbieri, who sits on the board of a crisis pregnancy centre in northern Idaho, voted in favour of the legislation to ban doctors from prescribing abortion-inducing drugs via video conference or phone call . 'In my view, this may reduce the number of abortions.' However, this isn't the first time Idaho lawmakers have received attention while debating abortion legislation. In 2013, Republican Representative Ron Mendive drew audible gasps in a committee when he asked if the American Civil Liberties Union-Idaho's pro-abortion stance also meant they supported prostitution. A year prior, Republican Senator Chuck Winder drew national criticism after he suggested on the Senate floor that a doctor should ask a woman who says she was raped if it could have been caused by 'normal relations in a marriage.' The House State Affairs Committee is considered one of the most conservative committees in Idaho's Republican-controlled Statehouse. Already this year, the committee has rejected a proposal that would provide legal protections to gay and lesbian people and halted legislation proposed by a 14-year-old girl to designate the Idaho Giant Salamander as the official state amphibian. It has endorsed, however, a bill that would expand parental rights in Idaho law.","Idaho state affairs committee was hearing testimony on a new abortion bill .

"Judge Lynn Roberts, pictured, ruled Essex County Council must pay a  proportion of the legal costs the couple incurred during the 14-month long legal battle . The adoptive parents of a seriously-disabled child have won £14,000 in legal costs after a year-long battle with the local council over care for their son. The five-year-old, known only as 'K' for legal reasons, was diagnosed with learning difficulties and severe mental health issues after being placed with the couple in 2011. A dispute broke out between the couple, referred to as NP and SP, and Essex County Council over who should pay for the preparation of a care plan to meet the complex need of the young boy. Judge Lynn Roberts, sitting at Chelmsford Family Court, ruled last month that Essex must pay a large proportion of the legal costs the couple incurred during the 14-month long legal battle. Lawyers for the couple warned that if other local authorities were to act like Essex, it will become 'impossible' for 'hard to place children' like child K to find homes with loving families. In the written judgement released today, Judge Lynn Roberts said that at the time K was placed with the couple, aged 22 months, 'the extent of his difficulties had not been understood'. It meant the couple found themselves 'parenting a child with an array of problems' without any support as Essex had not identified the child's difficulties - or the assistance they would require. Despite these challenges, the judge said, the proposed adopters are 'devoted' to the boy and he is 'very much part of their family'. They filed their application to adopt K in July 2013. By this point, the couple claim they had raised issues about the levels of support they needed for several months. This was done in light of the adoptive mother's health deteriorating, said Judge Roberts. Local authority officials made it clear Essex would not pay for any assessment of K's complex needs - required to draw up a care plan - and expected them 'to sort out the issues with the social workers'. The court ordered the council to carry out an assessment and put together a proposed care plan but delays and missed deadlines meant an agreement was not reached until November 2014. During this time, the council also failed to address the particular needs of K until it received a report from children's charity Barnardos. A dispute broke out between the couple, referred to as NP and SP, and Essex County Council (headquarters pictured) over who should pay for the preparation of a care plan to meet the complex need of the young boy . Judge Roberts said the proposed adopters argued that, without expert legal advice and representation, they would not have achieved the support plan they now had and which is vital for K. August 2011 - Child K, then aged 22 months, is placed with prospective adoptive parents. July 2013 - The couple filed to adopt. They claim that by this point they had been raising issues about the support the boy required for several months. 8 November 2013 - Court orders the council to produce a report and assessment, to include the extent of the child’s complex needs and the services which are to be offered. Prior to this, the Council made it clear they expected the couple to 'sort out the issues with the social workers'. Later that day, the Council submitted a care plan, saying 'it was not a draft'. 20 December 2013 - Further order made about obtaining further medical records for K. January 2014 - Council misses deadline to produce report and assessment, including care services to be offered. February 2014 - Council misses deadline to produce medical records. Hearing was put off until June. Mid-September 2014 - Solicitors for the couple chase the council for new report and support plan after it was not submitted in August. 30 September 2014 - Solicitors wrote about the Local Authority meeting the proposed adopters costs, but this was not agreed. 5 November 2014 - Local Authority filed yet another support plan. This support plan did not in fact say what the social worker had indicated it would say. 14 November 2014 - Another support plan emerged which was acceptable to the couple with a couple of minor amendments. 18 November 2014 - They applied for an Order that the Local Authority pay their costs. 25 November 2014 - Judge heard submissions in relation to the costs incurred by the prospective adopters in their adoption of K. 12 December 2014 - Judge orders local authority to pay £14,000 in costs. Today - Written judgement released . The county council argued it should not have to pay the couple's costs bill and contended it had been 'generous' to the family in terms of funding - particularly regarding the final support plan. The judge concluded that without the proposed adopters' expert legal advice, 'either the placement would have broken down because the appropriate support was not in place, or the adoption would have gone ahead but without the support which all now agree is necessary, which would have meant K and his parents would continue to struggle.' The judge said there had been 'great delay', and it appeared the local authority was slow to recognise the extent of K's difficulties and the demands his care was making on NP and SP. The couple sought just over £17,000 in legal fees, but the judge ruled they were entitled to £14,000. She said this reflected the fact that NP and SP had been successful in securing the right support plan necessary to make an adoption order possible. It also reflected fact that the county council 'were unreasonable and delayed and did not comply with orders of the court'. Commenting on the ruling, Nigel Priestley, representing the couple, said: 'Many people must wonder - ""Why did it take so long?"" Less committed couples would have thrown in the towel years ago.' Mr Priestly added: 'The Government want more adoptions. They want to see hard to place children finding homes in loving families. 'If other local authorities act like Essex it will be impossible for this key policy to succeed. Why should adopters have to fight for support and risk their own money in this way? 'There is no legal aid for contests over support plans. The costs in this case ran to five figures before Essex were told to pay. 'The local authority knew that they would have to find a specialist foster placement or residential home for K if this placement failed. Essex attitude was inexplicable': . NP said the council's approach was 'a disgrace' and the local authority 'fought us all the way'. He added: 'Essex didn't understand how the pressure from K's behaviour was building and (my wife) became seriously ill. 'We realised we needed legal representation. An inadequate support plan was prepared. 'We tried to negotiate changes to the plan. Social services and the independent reviewing officer said that this was the final version. There could be no additional support. 'We are delighted by the judge's decision to make Essex pay towards our costs.' Judge Roberts said she had made the final adoption order on the day she considered the issue of costs. Judge Roberts, sitting at Chelmsford Family Court (pictured) said the adopters argued that, without expert legal advice and representation, they would not have achieved the vital support plan they now had for K .","Boy was placed with couple in August 2011 when he was 22 months old .

"Emergency operators are still largely in the dark when it comes to pinpointing the location of 911 calls seven years after a police failed to trace a call from a kidnapped mother-of-two before she was murder. Denise Amber Lee, 21, was sexually assaulted before being shot dead and dumped in a shallow grave by killer Michael King, despite managing to make a desperate 911 calls. Officer's were unable to trace the 21-year-old's mobile phone signal and seven years on less than half of all 911 calls include the GPS coordinates of the phone used, according to 10 News. Kidnapped mother-of-two Denise Amber Lee, 21, was murdered after police failed to trace her desperate 911 call . The mother-of-two, pictured with her children, was murdered by Michael King who is currently on death row . This is despite the likes of Facebook and a large number of other apps being able to pinpoint the exact location of their user. Two decades ago the Federal Communications Commission required phone carriers to locate 95 per cent of mobile calls, but only those made outside. When the calls are made from inside a building or car, the phone's GPS tracking is often disrupted, as was the case for Mrs Lee. 'It's unbelievable how many lives could be saved every year if the FCC would improve the cell location requirements from the cell providers,' said Mrs Lee's widower, Nathan, in 2013. More than 70 per cent of all emergency calls are made from a mobile phone, but unlike landlines do not alert dispatchers to the callers' location. 'We get location information from cell phones on just a little less than 50% of our calls,' Jerry Wheeler, Sarasota County's Public Safety Communications manager, told 10 News. If the signal is weak the dispatcher only receives the location of the mobile phone tower and that can be miles away from the actual phone. The FCC updated their rules earlier this year, but scrapped initial proposals to have a 30 second limit to locate mobile phone calls to 911. Instead, within the next two years mobile phone providers will need to provide location data on 40 per cent of calls and increases to 70 per cent in five years. By six years they will need to be able to tell dispatchers coordinates within 50 metres of the call in 80 per cent of cases, the FCC said according to 10 News. 'It's unbelievable how many lives could be saved every year if the FCC would improve the cell location requirements from the cell providers,' said Mrs Lee's widower, Nathan, in 2013 . Discovery: Denise Amber Lee's body was found in a shallow grave on January 19, 2008 after a widespread search . Technology experts say that the main issue for mobile phone companies and their lawyers is the issue of privacy. Mrs Lee was abducted from her Florida home by Michael King in January 2008 and managed to make a six minute 911 call while trapped in her green Camero. During the call she said: 'I'm sorry. I just want to go. I just want to see my family. I just want to see my family again please. Oh please. I just want to see my family again.' An eyewitness also told police exact cross streets of where the crime was unfolding, but because of inefficiencies in the 911 system, the calls weren't dispatched. The mother-of-two was later killed and dumped in a shallow grave where she was found two days later. Michael King was later convicted of Lee's murder, and is now on death row.","Less than half of 911 calls from cell include exact location of phone used .

"Hershey's has announced it is pulling GMO ingredients from its most popular chocolate snacks after complaints from thousands of consumers. Its biggest sellers, including Hershey's Kisses Milk Chocolates and Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bars, will start featuring 'simpler ingredients' this year, the U.S. confectionery giant announced last week. The company is also dropping emulsifier polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR) and artificial vanillin, the Confectionery News reported. PGPR reduces the viscosity of chocolate and is used by companies as a replacement for expensive raw ingredient cocoa butter. The decision comes amid a growing backlash against 'Frankenfoods'. Critics of GMO (Genetically Modified Organisms) foods consider them environmentally suspect and a possible health threat. But many in the food industry insist the foods are safe, the technology boosts food production, and its use is less environmentally harmful than traditional farming methods. Changes: Hershey's Kisses Milk Chocolates (left) and Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bars (right) will start using 'simpler ingredients' this year, the company said - in a move applauded by anti-GMO demonstrators . Hershey's joins other companies including General Mills, Unilever and Post Foods in responding to consumers' demand to remove GMO ingredients from products. And just last week, Nestle announced that it will cut artificial colors and flavors from its U.S. confectionery by the end of 2015. Hershey's acted after tens of thousands of people urged the company to drop GMO ingredients on their Facebook page and through emails in a relentless campaign led by GMO Inside. But in a statement, John Roulac, co-chair of GMO Inside, said that Hershey's has further to go. 'Hershey's needs to take the next step and go non-GMO with all of its chocolates, and get third-party verification for non-GMO ingredients. This includes sourcing milk from cows not fed GMOs and agreeing to prohibit any synthetic biology ingredients, starting with vanilla,' he said. Complaints: Hershey's was flooded with complaints from people calling for them to drop GMO ingredients . Celebration: Many thanked the company after the decision - while others accused them of caving in to pressure, saying there is no scientific evidence proving that GMO products are harmful . 'Consumers are increasingly looking for non-GMO products and verification, and Hershey's and its competitors would be wise to offer third-party verified non-GMO products to consumers.' Much of Europe, including Germany and France, wants to ban GMO crops amid concerns over their impact on the environment, food and human health. The administrations in Scotland and Wales also oppose the technology having seen the problems that have emerged in the U.S., such as superweeds, which have proven difficult to control. But Britain and Spain support the technology and are keen to see the crops in the fields and on dinner plates as soon as possible. Last month, the European Parliament voted for a new approvals process in growing GMO crops - meaning that they could appear in UK fields from next year. The system will allow each country to decide for itself whether or not to grow a GM crop – once it has been ruled safe by EFSA, which is the EU's food safety body. Critics of GMO foods consider them environmentally suspect and a possible health threat. They fear that pollen from GM plants will spread to other conventional and organic crops, so polluting the entire food chain. But many in the food industry insist the foods are safe, the technology boosts food production, and its use is less environmentally harmful than traditional farming methods. The move comes after Hershey's said last December that it was exploring transitioning away from high fructose corn syrup. It announced its decision last week. 'We all want and deserve to know what's in our food,' said the company's president and CEO John P. Bilbrey in a statement. 'We will strive for simplicity with all of our ingredients, but we may not achieve it with every product. This is a journey and it will take time. 'We are equally committed to sharing what we achieve and what we don't. For ingredients that may not be as simple, we will explain what they are and why we need them to provide the great flavors, aromas, textures and appearances that our consumers know and love.' The company said the new ingredients would be more expensive but promised to maintain consumer prices, the Confectionery News reported. GMOs are plants and animals that have had been created by mixing DNA from different species to make a new one. They are found in many strains of corn, sugar beets and soy, among other foods. There has been debate over the health impacts of the technology, and there has been a push throughout Europe to drop what critics have dubbed 'Frankenfoods'. Last May, Vermont ruled that GM food must carry a label - the first state to make labeling a legal requirement. The legislation will come into force in 2016. Debate: Critics say genetically modified foods are environmentally suspect and harmful to consumers' health, while supporters say that the technology boosts food production and that they are safe to eat . Maine and Connecticut have previously passed laws requiring labels on GMO foods, but their laws don't take effect unless neighboring states follow suit. Last year, the Biotechnology Industry Organization said in a statement that scientists and regulators worldwide recognize that foods made from genetically modified crops are safe. 'And these same GM crops have enabled farmers to produce more on less land with fewer pesticide applications, less water and reduced on-farm fuel use,' BIO Vice President Cathleen Enright said.","Hershey's Kisses Milk Chocolates and Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bars will start featuring 'simpler ingredients' this year, the company announced .

"Pensioners are now better off than almost 60 per cent of the entire population, while young people have seen a slump in their fortunes. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s people in their early twenties had more disposable income than most, but over several decades their comfortable position has been steadily eroded, according to research by the Financial Times. At the same time, older people are now better off than most, as the Tories seek to woo the grey vote ahead of the general election. Scroll down for video . Throughout the 1960s and 1970s young people had more disposable income than most, but over several decades their comfortable position has been steadily eroded, according to research by the Financial Times . David Cameron was yesterday forced to deny he was putting wealthy OAPs ahead of struggling families and young people. He repeated his 2010 pledge to cut Winter Fuel Payments, free bus passes, TV licences, prescriptions and eye tests for wealthy pensioners. But at a time when deep cuts are needed to the welfare bill, critics accuse the Prime Minister of targeting the working poor while protecting the well-off in retirement. According to the FT research, people aged 20-25 on average incomes after housing were better off than more than 60 per cent of the population. But dramatic shifts in their fortunes mean they are now only better off than 40 per cent of people. By contrast, people aged 65-69, who were more comfortable than just 20 per cent of people in the 1960s and 1970s now have more disposable income than almost 60 per cent. It suggests Baby Boomers born in the 1940s are the luckiest generation, enjoying high standards of living in their teens continue today. The relative wealth of pensioners has led to calls for them to bear their share of public spending cuts. David Cameron was yesterday forced to deny he was putting wealthy OAPs ahead of struggling families and young people as he announced pensioner benefits would be protected from cuts . Mark Littlewood, director general of the Institute for Economic Affairs think tank, said: 'Politicians must stop trying to woo elderly voters at the expense of other generations. 'The elderly cannot remain immune to public spending restraint and abolishing these benefits would help ease the burden on the working age population.' The Tories hope that the promise to protect £7.5billion in pensioner benefits will secure the support of older voters. Mr Cameron claimed people in retirement cannot adjust their incomes if benefits are cut, whereas younger people could find extra work. In a speech in Hastings yesterday, the PM said: 'We need to make sure that we are fair as we reduce the deficit, we need to make sure the richest pay the most - and they have and they will in future. 'The fact is, if something happens to you when you're old, or to your income, you can't as easily change your circumstances as younger people can. 'You can't as easily move house, or change job, or go full time. You need to know support is always there for you - and that's another reason why I want to protect these benefits.' Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg has accused the Tories of targeting the working poor for cuts while protecting pensioners . But the idea has been slammed by the Lib Dems, who want to remove winter fuel payments and TV licences from higher rate tax paying pensioners but continue the pensioner bus pass, free prescriptions or eye tests for all. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: 'That is the Tory policy - tough on the weak but soft on the strong. Nothing asked of rich pensioners but working age poor to be hammered.' Liberal Democrat Pensions minister Steve Webb added: 'The working age poor will pay the price for the Conservative ring fence for the very wealthiest pensioners. Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'At a time when we're trying to find savings everywhere else in government, it's hard to shake the suspicion that austerity stops at 65. 'The extraordinary debt that politicians have racked up will weigh very heavily on our children and grandchildren, and continuing these policies into the next Parliament will only add to that potentially back-breaking burden.'","Research shows how average pensioners are better off than 60% of people .

"His hands and feet were clearly visible - but baby Silas Philips was in no rush to enter the world. Born still inside his amniotic sac, he has since been described as a 'medical miracle' by doctors. Silas was delivered three months premature at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in California. And doctors performing the Caesarean section on his mother, Chelsea, were astonished to see his amniotic sac was still intact. Pictures show Silas curled up inside with the placenta and umbilical cord, his tiny hands and a leg clearly visible. Scroll down for video . Silas Philips was born three months premature at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in California. Doctors performing the Caesarean section were astonished to see he was still in his amniotic sac . Born still inside his amniotic sac, Silas has since been described as a 'medical miracle' by doctors . Doctors performing the Caesarean section on his mother, Chelsea, were astonished to see he his amniotic sac was still intact . And until the bag was broken, he was still getting oxygen through the placenta, CBS reported. The amniotic sac is a bag of clear, pale fluid inside the womb where the unborn baby develops and grows. The fluid helps to cushion the baby from bumps and injury, as well as providing it with fluids it can breathe and swallow. It also maintains a constant temperature for the baby. Typically the amniotic sac breaks on its own during birth, which is commonly referred to as a mother's 'water breaking'. Or during a C-section, the surgeon cuts through it to deliver the baby. Doctors say the chance of the amniotic sac remaining completely intact after birth is 'ultra rare'. It was a moment that mesmerised Dr William Binder, who delivered Silas. 'Even though it sounds cliched, we caught our breath,' he said. 'It really felt like a moment of awe... and one that will stick in my moment for some time. Until the bag was broken, Silas was still getting oxygen through the placenta. Doctors who delivered say the moment 'caught our breath' 'He was seconds old and still in the water bag, with the placenta and umbilical cord tucked inside.' After taking a few seconds to snap the incredible sight in front of him, Dr Binder set to work removing Silas out of his amniotic sac and getting him breathing. Jessica Alba's daughter Haven was born inside the amniotic sac in 2011 . However Silas's mother didn't realise the excitement her son had caused until her mother showed her Dr Binder's photo. 'It was definitely like a clear film where you could definitely make out his head and his hair,' she told CBS News. 'He was kind of in a foetal position and you could see like his arms and his legs curled up. 'It was actually really cool to see. And when I heard that was actually really rare I was like ""oh my gosh you're a special little baby"".' Despite being born at just 26 weeks, Silas is doing so well that doctors hope he will go home within the next month. Actress Jessica Alba has spoken out about her daughter Haven who was born inside the amniotic sac in 2011. She said at the time: 'The doctor had never seen anything like it before. He grabbed the nurse and said: 'Look at this!'. 'I was in the middle of pushing and he told me to hold on a minute and not to push. 'He was wearing basketball shorts and a T-shirt and said: 'Oh I have to get my scrubs on for this!' The sac burst on its own after she came out. It was a trip.' In fact Jessica's experience inspired Haven's name. She explained: 'When I was in recovery we still hadn't chosen her name. [Her father Cash Warren] picked her up and said she came into the world in her 'safe haven' and [her name] clicked right then for both of us.' The amniotic sac starts to form and fill with fluid within days of a woman conceiving. Amniotic fluid is mainly water, but from about week 10 onwards, the baby passes small amounts of urine into the fluid. The amount of amniotic fluid increases gradually during pregnancy until about week 38, when it reduces slightly until the baby is born. The amniotic sac is a bag of clear, pale fluid inside the womb where the unborn baby develops and grows. The fluid helps to cushion the baby from injury, and provides it with fluids so it can breathe and swallow . Being born 'en caul' is the term used when the child is born within an intact amniotic sac, which occurred in the story above. It is also known as a 'veiled birth'. Most en caul births occur in premature babies. Statistics relating to such births are sparse, but deliveries involving any form of caul are thought to occur in roughly one in 80,000 births. Being born 'with the caul', as it is known, occurs when a child is delivered with a portion of amniotic membrane on their face. 'Caul' literally means 'helmeted head' or 'veil'. A baby with the caul is called the 'caulbearer'. Being born with the caul in medieval times was interpreted as a sign of good luck and that the child was destined for greatness. Saving the caul was considered an important tradition of childbirth. The midwife would rub a sheet of paper across the baby's head and face, pressing the material of the caul onto the paper. It would then be presented to the mother, to be kept as an heirloom. Other traditions have linked the caul to fertility and some say it protects a person from the forces of evil, such as witches and sorcerers.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"The missing Malaysia Airlines flight 370 was hijacked on the orders of Vladimir Putin and secretly landed in Kazakhstan, an expert has claimed in a wild new theory. Jeff Wise, a U.S. science writer who spearheaded CNN's coverage of the Boeing 777-200E, has based his outlandish theory on pings that the plane gave off for seven hours after it went missing, that were recorded by British telecommunications company Inmarsat. Wise believes that hijackers 'spoofed' the plane's navigation data to make it seem like it went in another direction, but flew it to the Baikonur Cosmodrome, which is leased from Kazakhstan by Russia. However Wise admits in New York Magazine that he does not know why Vladimir Putin would want to steal a plane full of people and that his idea is somewhat 'crazy'. Scroll down for video . New theory: An aviation expert believes that Russia hijacked MH370 - which disappeared 40 minutes after flying out of Kuala Lumpur on March 8 last year - as part of a secret mission, and landed it at Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan . Expert: Jeff Wise is a science writer, author and member of aviation experts the Independent Group . Scene: This crumbling airport was built for planes to self-land at Baikonur, meaning if MH370 was hijacked, the people responsible would not have to be pilots in order to set the plane down. Wise contends a Boeing 777 could easily fit at the base . Possibility: Wise said that the plane would have landed in the dark, and had 90 minutes to either refuel and fly somewhere else or cover up before sunrise broke . Satellite: Images taken from the sky show the disused airport, which is part of the Baikonur complex, where Jeff Wise believes MH370 landed . 'If Russia has the savvy to plan an insanely complex special operation, they also have a track record of implementing such schemes,' Wise wrote on his website. 'Kazakhstan lacks the means and technical savvy to carry out a sophisticated hijack, the same is not true of Russia. 'Russia is (arguably) the only country that stands apart from the West and yet is as technically advanced in the aerospace industry as the United States.' Wise admits he does not know why Vladimir Putin would want to steal a plane full of people and that his idea is somewhat 'crazy'. 'Maybe he wanted to demonstrate to the United States, which had imposed the first punitive sanctions on Russia the day before, that he could hurt the West and its allies anywhere in the world,' Wise wrote in New York Magazine. 'Maybe what he was really after were the secrets of one of the plane’s passengers. 'Maybe there was something strategically crucial in the hold. 'Or maybe he wanted the plane to show up unexpectedly somewhere someday, packed with explosives. 'There’s no way to know.' Wise also noted there were three Russian men onboard the flight, two of them Ukrainian passport holders. Secret plot?: Russian President Vladimir Putin orchestrated the disappearance of flight MH370 as part of an attack against the West, an aviation expert has claimed . Space port: MH370 registered its last satellite 'ping' near Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, Wise claims . Heading south: Satellite data from Flight MH370 showed that the plane made several turns after the last radio call, before finally heading towards Antarctica . The theory follows a new documentary that claims MH370 was deliberately flown off course by someone in the cockpit. Aviation disaster experts analyzed satellite data  and discovered - like the data recorded by Inmarsat - that the plane flew on for hours after losing contact. Careful examination of the evidence has revealed that MH370 made three turns after the last radio call, first a turn to the left, then two more, taking the plane west, then south towards Antarctica. According to Malcolm Brenner, a world's leading expert in the causes of aviation disasters, those turns 'strongly suggest' someone in the cockpit deliberately flew MH370 off course. 'This accident has caught the attention of the world in a way I have not seen in a forty-year career in aviation,' Mr Brenner says. The claims are being made in a new National Geographic documentary out next month where Mr Brenner and a team of experts try to solve the mystery of MH370. This follows confident claims by the Australian co-ordinator of the search that the doomed jetliner will be found within the next few months. Evidence: According to Malcolm Brenner, a world's leading expert in the causes of aviation disasters, those turns 'strongly suggest' someone in the cockpit deliberately flew MH370 off course . As the current search for the Malaysia Airlines plane is set to wrap up by the end of May, Australian Transport Safety Bureau Commissioner Martin Dolan said he was hopeful his team would unearth the wreckage by then, News.com.au reported. But the Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre is remaining tight lipped about the issue, saying the Chinese, Malaysian and Australian governments would be assessing what to do next. Flight MH370 vanished on March 8, 2014 while travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board. No trace of the jet has been recovered since then but Mr Dolan believes his team are close to discovering the wreckage. 'I don't wake up every day thinking 'This will be the day' but I do wake up every day hoping this will be it, and expecting that sometime between now and May that will be the day,' Commissioner Dolan told News Corp. 'It's been both baffling and from our point of view unprecedented - not only the mystery of it, but also on the scale of what we're doing to find the aircraft. 'As we keep on pointing out, we don't have a certainty only a confidence that we'll find the missing aircraft.' The search for MH370 has so far been fruitless, with the crash site initially thought to be in the South China Sea or Gulf of Thailand. Accident: Relatives of passengers of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 held placards during a protest demanding to know why the Malaysian government had announced recently that the fate of MH370 was an accident . But search efforts were then redirected to the southern part of the Indian Ocean. This late start meant any trace of the wreckage on the surface of the ocean floor would have sunk and it is thought some of the debris would have appeared on the shores of Sumatra in Western Indonesia. So far, they have been unsuccessful in tracking down any piece of the aircraft but experts were trying to predict its floating patterns to locate the wreckage site by considering 'how the aircraft would've collided with the water'. The Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre, which, headed by Australia, is conducting the search says that so far the underwater operations have scoured 22,000 square kilometres of the ocean bed, equalling around 36 per cent of the priority search area. It is estimated that if there are no delays with vessels, equipment or from the weather, the underwater search will be mostly finished some time in May. The 'Go Phoenix' supply ship has remained in the area, 2,500km to the south west of Perth, western Australia, but three vessels involved in the underwater search have this week suspended operations to return to port in Australia for scheduled visits. Despite months of searching in the area, there have been no sightings of debris on the surface or any clues that the aircraft is lying on the sea bed in region covered so far.","Jeff Wise is a science author and member of the Independent Group .

"A 95-year-old man's arm was elevated using a carrier bag and later a pillowcase after nurses struggled to find a specialised medical sling. After waiting for 12 hours on a trolley at New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton, Joseph Ward's family were told staff would have to use a carrier bag to secure his arm. When he was transferred to another ward, an orthopaedic doctor replaced the bag with a pillowcase, to help drain Mr Ward's arm of excess fluid. Mr Ward's daughter, Jane Crutchley, who said she was forced to go and buy a sling herself, has branded her father's treatment an 'outrage'. Joseph Ward, 95, had his arm elevated using a pillowcase, left, and plastic carrier bag, right, at New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton, after medics told his family there were no specialised slings available . Ms Crutchley said: 'It is outrageous that staff are so stretched they couldn't even get a sling for a 95-year-old man. 'In the end I was so frustrated that I went and bought one myself for £39.99.' But the hospital said the temporary slings were used to ensure the 95-year-old's medical needs were met and that he was not left in pain. Mr Ward fell at his home in Wednesfield in the West Midlands on February 11. He was found on the floor by a district nurse, who had visited the diabetic 95-year-old to give him his insulin. The nurse took him straight to A&E at New Cross Hospital. There, medics told his family he needed a sling after they diagnosed  compartment syndrome - a painful, and potentially serious condition caused by swelling and bleeding in a bundle of muscles. The condition is thought to have been caused by the pressure of Mr Ward lying on his arm all night. Medics said he needed his arm elevating to reduce the swelling and help drain the built-up fluid away. But his daughter claims staff 'couldn't find one (a sling) so they used a triangular bandage combined with a green carrier bag'. She said: 'Later when he was moved to a different ward - diabetic ward C16 - they tried using a pillow case.' His daughter Jane Crutchley, claims she was forced to buy a traditional sling, pictured, branding her father's treatment an 'outrage' Ms Crutchley claims her father still hadn't been given a specialised sling a week later, prompting her to take matters into her own hands. She went to buy a sling herself, at a cost of £39.99. 'His arm needed to be fixed at a specific angle to his shoulder and so a normal sling wasn't enough,' she said. 'So to find out that they were still using a plastic bag and a pillow case a week later was awful. 'It wasn't comfortable and he appeared to be in so much pain. 'Dad is fiercely independent and he lives in his own home. And at the moment it's been taken away from him. 'He's normally very with it but at the time he was so disorientated that I don't think he could protest. 'It's fortunate that my sister and I are there to look after him but so many other people are completely alone and don't have someone who can go and buy them the equipment they need. 'I'm no medic but he is still in pain and his arm doesn't appear to have improved at all. 'I feel that the delay in this could have slowed down the recovery to his arm.' A spokesman for the Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, which runs New Cross Hospital, said the trust's head of nursing Rose Baker has personally apologised to Mr Ward. 'With no Bradford sling in stock and to keep the patient comfortable while elevating his arm, staff on both wards used improvised slings and pillows,' he said. 'On ward C21 a temporary sling was made using a bag because it was cleanable and met hospital infection control standards. 'It was then replaced with a pillow case sling by an orthopaedic doctor on ward C16. 'This is a widely used and accepted practice to provide elevation. An alternative sling was then sourced from the fracture clinic which the patient is now using. 'At no time was the patient uncomfortable and his medical needs were met at all times. An incident report has been filed and any lessons learned will be shared with colleagues. 'The trust has agreed to reimburse the family the cost of the two Bradford slings which they purchased.'","Joseph Ward was taken to hospital in Wolverhampton after a fall .

"A judge's 'game-changing' decision to tell the ex-wife of a millionaire racehorse surgeon to ‘get a job’ could mean that more divorced women will now have to support themselves after children turn seven. Tracey Wright, 51, argued she should continue to receive £75,000-a-year maintenance  from her wealthy former husband Ian, but Lord Justice Pitchford ruled she should not be 'supported for life'. The former riding instructor never got a job following her split with the equine surgeon after 11 years of marriage, but after losing her case she and other women may have to when children grow up. Senior lawyers said today that mothers will now have to be more self-sufficient from their rich ex-husbands and ‘spousal maintenance is no longer a meal ticket for life’. 'Game-changer': Tracey Wright was told to 'get a job' by a High Court judge after losing her maintenance battle with former husband Ian Wright, which could see many divorced mothers being forced into work . Mr and Mrs Wright’s £1.3million seven-bedroom home, set in 16 acres of Suffolk countryside, was sold and the proceeds divided following their divorce in 2008. Mrs Wright had argued for continued maintenance to support their two children, but this was thrown out at the Court of Appeal yesterday and she was urged to get back to work. She says has been ‘made to feel like a criminal for putting my children first’. The judge’s decision is a landmark ruling that will threaten the ‘norm’ of divorcees receiving generous ongoing payments. The presumption in English law is that wealthy ex- husbands will support their former wives with ‘spousal maintenance’ payments. But yesterday’s decision raises the possibility that this is ‘on the wane’. Charlotte Posnansky, of law firm Charles Russell Speechlys, said the case meant that spousal maintenance could end once children reach school age. Experts said today the landmark ruling could now end indefinite payments for former partners of wealthy spouses, and change divorce cases in Britain for good. Mei-Ling McNab, a family law partner at Brachers, said: 'This landmark decision will be a game-changer for future big ticket divorce cases. 'It confirms mothers with children aged over seven should support themselves. 'This decision is the first step towards self-sufficiency for women on the basis that despite being mothers, they are likely to have an earning capacity and therefore a responsibility to maintain themselves'. Elizabeth Hicks, family law expert at Irwin Mitchell, said the landmark case was the latest in which judges made it plain ‘spousal maintenance is no longer a meal ticket for life’. Charlotte Posnansky, of law firm Charles Russell Speechlys, added: ‘For the last 14 years, the pendulum has swung heavily in favour of women when considering the financial implications upon divorce … [it] seems to be swinging back again.’ High profile: In November American Jamie Cooper-Hohn was awarded £337m in  Britain’s biggest ever divorce settlement after Galina Besharova's £200m divorce from oligarch Boris Berezovsky in 2011, together right . London has become the 'divorce capital of the world' because ex-wives have chosen British courts to bumper payouts from their rich former husbands. In November financier's wife Jamie Cooper-Hohn, who is American, was awarded £337million in what could be Britain’s biggest ever divorce settlement from Sir Chris Hohn. The pair – who have homes in London, the US and West Indies – had fought over assets totalling more than £700 million at the High Court. In 2011 Galina Besharova was awarded up to £200million  as part of her divorce from late billionaire Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky, . Last month Baroness Deech, former chair of the Bar Standards Board, said Britain's divorce laws should be tougher on women because they are encouraged to shun work and 'find a footballer' to marry. She says as the law stands young women are sent the 'bad message' to find someone rich and 'once you are married you need never go out to work'. 'Never mind about A levels or a degree or taking the Bar course — come out and find a footballer,' she said. Rulimh: Lord Justice Pitchford, sitting in the Royal Courts of Justice in London (pictured), rejected the application by Mrs Wright, which could change how maintenance is now paid in the UK . Victory: Mr Wright, left, said it was not fair he was expected to support his wife long into retirement when she refused to work . She believes that couples should settle the terms of their divorce before their wedding and this would stop women marrying successful men and then running off with a large share of their wealth. The peer is currently backing a House of Lords bill that would make prenuptial and postnuptial agreements agreements legally binding. She said: 'We have a whole area of law which says once you are married you need never go out to work, [that] you are automatically entitled to everything you might need even if that marriage breaks down and it's your fault.' For more than a decade London has been considered 'the divorce capital of the world' and led to 'divorce tourism' by ex-wives from all over the world seeking bumper payouts. The flexibility given to judges presiding over divorce proceedings in England and Wales means spouses are more likely to receive generous maintenance payments than in other countries. In November American Jamie Cooper-Hohn was awarded £330million in what is believed to be Britain's most expensive ever divorce case. Her ex-husband Sir Chris Hohn, pictured right, did however manage to deny her an equal share of the couple’s vast wealth. Mrs Cooper-Hohn raised their four children and ran the charitable foundations into which her husband poured most of the money made. The judge said, however, that he had also played a major role in managing the charities and that the couple would have no £870million fortune to divide without him. This ruling is likely to have a significant impact on future divorce rows. In 2011 Galina Besharova was awarded up to £200million as part of her divorce from late billionaire Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky, . Other generous settlements include that awarded to Heather Mills following the break down of her marriage to Sir Paul McCartney 2008. Following the four-year marriage, Miss Mills received £24.3million. Michelle Young was awarded a £20million sum after parting ways with her 'bankrupt' husband Scot Young, who fell to his death . In 2006 Beverley Charman, the former wife of insurance magnate John Charman was awarded a £48million settlement by the English courts in proceedings which took two years. Mr Charman appealed the decision but the pay out, which made legal history at the time, was upheld in 2007.","Tracey Wright told to get a job 11 years after her divorce from millionaire .

"A US Marine charged with murdering a transgender Filipina refused to enter a plea on Monday as he sought to have the case dismissed. His trial in Olongapo City in the northern Philippines, will go ahead nevertheless. The court overseeing proceedings against Private First Class Joseph Scott Pemberton, from New Bedford, Massachusetts, entered a not guilty plea for him. The trial can now start within weeks, lawyers for the victim told reporters outside the court. The cramped courthouse, surrounded by market stalls selling dried fish and rice, is about a five-minute drive from a motel in a northern Philippine red-light district where the battered remains of Jennifer Laude, 26, were found in October last year. Private First Class Pemberton faces life imprisonment if found guilty of the murder of Jennifer Laude. Laude was transgender and began life as Jeffrey . Pemberton, who was 19 at that time, was the last person seen with Laude before her death, according to police. He faces life imprisonment if found guilty. On the night of the death, Pemberton and other Marines had just finished joint training exercises with Filipino troops at a military base. Pemberton had ventured into the nearby red-light district in Olangapo city for some rest and relaxation, met Laude at a bar, and went with her to the motel . Prosecutors allege that after discovering she was transgender he beat and strangled her before drowning her in a toilet bowl. The pre-trial hearings will continue this week, with his trial expected to start in the third week of March, one of the lawyers representing the victim's family, Virginia Suarez, told reporters. U.S. Marine Joseph Pemberton (left) met Jennifer Laude (right) at a red-light district bar after finishing joint training exercises with Filipino troops at a nearby military base . Prosecutors will present at least 18 witnesses at the trial including the motel cashier who says that Pemberton was the only person with Laude (pictured) the entire time she was at the hotel . Prosecutors will present at least 18 witnesses at the trial, including a friend of Laude who accompanied her and Pemberton to the motel as they checked in, Suarez said. A preliminary police report and autopsy findings that showed Laude, 26, died due to 'asphyxia by drowning' will also be presented as evidence, she said. 'We have enough evidence and witnesses to convict Pemberton of murder,' she said. 'He [Pemberton] was the only person with Jennifer the entire time she was in the hotel and the [motel] cashier can attest to that.' The murder charge, which requires premeditation, carries a maximum 40-year prison sentence, compared to 20 years for homicide. Philippine supporters of Laude hold up her image during a protest near the courthouse in Olongapo, on February 23, 2015, she was beaten and drowned in a red-light district motel in October 2014 . While awaiting trial, Pemberton is being detained at an American-guarded facility inside the Philippines' military headquarters in Manila under the terms of a Visiting Forces Agreement . Pemberton's lawyers had earlier asked the justice ministry to dismiss the case, stating evidence linking him to the case was 'based on nothing but conjectures and speculations'. The ministry rejected the petition, and an appeal against that decision is still pending with a higher court. Pemberton's lawyers said on Monday that he would not enter a plea until those proceedings were over, according to Suarez. Pemberton appeared in the court for the arraignment on Monday, but the proceedings were closed to the media. The state prosecutor and lawyers for Laude's family, as well as her relatives, relayed to reporters outside the court his decision to not enter a plea, as well as the emotion inside. Surrounded by 16 burly guards, Pemberton looked calm and flashed a faint smile during the proceedings, which lasted about an hour, Laude's sister Marilou, who was in the courtroom, told reporters. 'He had the nerve to kill my sister, yet he was meek in the courtroom... I am seething with anger,' she said. Marilou said the Laude family were determined to see Pemberton jailed for the maximum time possible, and would not agree to a plea bargain if there was an offer. 'There will be no compromise. He must pay for what he did to our sister... Finally the trial is moving, finally we can get justice,' she said. Laude's death re-ignited long-simmering anti-US sentiment in the Philippines, a former American colony that still allows a significant American military presence via joint training exercises. Under a Visiting Forces Agreement governing US troops' conduct in the Philippines, the United States is allowed to retain custody of Pemberton during the legal proceedings against him. While awaiting trial, Pemberton is being detained at an American-guarded facility inside the Philippines' military headquarters in Manila.

"A 14-year-old who was born a boy but diagnosed with gender identity disorder aged just three has told how difficult it is to date despite her stunning looks. Jazz Jennings, from Florida, who does not want to reveal her birth name, opened up about liking boys but admitted the opposite sex won’t talk to her and some even call her ‘it'. Now at high school, the fashion-conscious youngster, who has written a book and launched a charity about her ordeal, has spoken about the difficulties of finding love and says the response she has had from her peers has left her feeling deflated. Scroll down for video . Jazz Jennings, 14, has told of her fears on joining the high school dating scene after admitting that some of her classmates won't speak to her while others refer to her as 'it' Born a boy, Jazz told her parents that it felt like she'd been 'born in the wrong body' and was diagnosed with gender identity disorder at the age of three. Pictured left, aged five months, and, right, aged two . Jazz said: 'I like some boys in my class at school but no one likes me back. 'It upsets me, I worry it's because I'm not pretty. But my friends tell me I'm attractive. 'My friends started chatting about boys they fancied but Mum warned me not to join in, in case I was teased. 'She thinks I need to wait until I'm older to start thinking about relationships. But I know one day I'll find someone who likes me for who I am.' Now Miss Jennings is paying attention to boys, mum Jeanette Jennings, 48, is conscious for her safety. She said: 'I do worry now she's getting older. I've told her if she ever goes on a date she needs to tell the boy beforehand. I'm worried someone could turn on her, maybe even attack her if they found out further down the line. 'I won't let Jazz go to other people's houses if the whole family isn't aware of the situation.' Following her diagnosis, Jazz, pictured aged six, transitioned and started living as a girl full-time aged five . Jazz, pictured aged five in a ballet dress left, and as a boy, right, has spoken of the difficulties finding love . Miss Jennings, who has twin older brothers, Sander and Griffin, both 16, and a sister Ari, 19, has 'longed to be a girl' for as long as she can remember and has never referred to herself as a boy. Her mother is pictured second from left . Miss Jennings plans to have full gender reassignment surgery after she turns 18. She said: 'The hardest part of being transgender is still having male genitalia. It reminds me I wasn't born in a female body. 'When I grew my hair and started wearing girls' clothes, it felt right. I've been teased by some schoolmates, but I've learnt to rise above it. 'I already feel like a girl but when I have the gender reassignment surgery my transition will be complete.' Although Jazz's mum and dad were worried about Jazz's behaviour at the start, since her diagnosis as a toddler, they have been unwavering in their support. Mrs Jennings said: 'We're so proud of her. We listened to Jazz and let her be the person she wanted to be. 'It was hard at first, but we saw how much happier she was living as a girl. Sometimes I mourn the loss of the idea of my son. But there's a wonderful person with us now and Jazz knows how special she is.' Miss Jennings, who has twin older brothers, Sander and Griffin, both 16, and a sister Ari, 19, has 'longed to be a girl' from ever since she can remember and never referred to herself as a boy. She said: 'Mum tells me that even as a two-year-old when she praised me for being a good boy, I'd correct her saying, 'I'm a good girl. 'As a toddler I wanted to wear girls' clothes and I'd play with Ari's dolls. Jazz founded the TransKids Purple Rainbow Foundation which has led her to meet a host of celebrities including transgender actress Laverne Cox, left, and Hollywood starlet Jennifer Lawrence, right . 'When I was two, Mum says I asked when the fairy was going to come with a magic wand and take away my penis.' Mrs Jennings and her husband, Greg, 47, realised it was not a phase and went to a paediatrician for advice. Miss Jennings said: 'The doctor showed me male and female dolls and asked me to point to which one I was. Straight away, I pointed to the female doll. I was the youngest patient the paediatrician had seen.' They advised Mrs Jennings to follow her daughter's lead but not to encourage her. But she was still adamant she was a girl and when she came in from nursery she would change into one of her sister's dresses or her favourite fairy outfit. Aged three, Miss Jennings was diagnosed with gender identity disorder after tests and counselling. Jazz, pictured aged 13, was prescribed hormone blockers when she was 11 to stop the production of testosterone, so she would not go through male puberty . Following her diagnosis, she gradually transitioned and started living as a girl full-time aged five. She said: 'I grew my hair, had my ears pierced and wore dresses. I felt so happy. 'My brothers and sisters accepted it and even though my dad struggled at first, both my parents were really supportive.' When Miss Jennings started approaching puberty, she was anxious about nature taking its course. She said: 'I had nightmares about growing facial hair and I hated the thought of my voice dropping and my body becoming more masculine.' Aged 11, she was prescribed hormone blockers to stop the production of testosterone, so she would not go through male puberty. 'It was such a relief,' she said. 'The hormone blockers are reversible, so if I come off them I'll go through male puberty. But there's no way that's happening - I'm too happy as a girl. I love experimenting with different hair styles and going clothes shopping.' Jazz, pictured aged seven, revealed she knew she wanted to be a boy when she was aged just three . While her family were happy with her transition, there were pupils at her school who were less understanding. Miss Jennings said: 'Some children asked why I was dressed like a girl when I was born a boy. I'd say I felt as though I'd been born in the wrong body. 'But at lunchtime some of the girls wouldn't sit with me and some of the boys even called me 'it'. When I got home I'd cry. 'I wasn't allowed to use the boys' or girls' toilets, I had to go to the nurse's office to use the bathroom. I felt so isolated.' Although she does not get attention from boys at school, she gets messages from others across the globe. She said: 'A lot of straight and transgender boys get in touch with me through my website and social media. Miss Jennings hopes to settle down with a family one day but currently she's using her experience to help others through the transition. She has founded the TransKids Purple Rainbow Foundation and written a book I Am Jazz about being diagnosed with gender identity disorder. An advocate of transgender rights, Jazz's campaigning work has led her to meet a host of stars including Laverne Cox, the transgender star of Orange is the new Black and Hollywood A-Lister Jennifer Lawrence.

"An American TV network has confirmed an adaptation of a risque British reality series in which troubled couples discuss their relationship issues with a panel of experts before retiring to a box on the show's set to have sex. Sex Box is being produced by WE tv and will premiere Friday at 10pm. It is based on the belief that people are more trusting and open in the moments immediately after sex due to the body's natural release of oxytocin, also known as the 'cuddle hormone'. The show sparked a fair amount controversy upon its debut in the UK in 2013. Scroll down for video . Post-coital: Couples emerge from the Sex Box and immediately sit down to discuss their relationship with three experts. Seen here is couple Elle and Brandon . Therapy: Sex Box is billed as 'the most extreme relationship therapy'. After emerging from the box, Brandon and Elle sit down to discuss problems in their relationship . Experts: Florida-based pastor Dr. Yvonne Capehart (left), sex therapist Dr. Chris Donaghue (middle) and LA psychotherapist Dr. Fran Walfish (right) Counseling: Each couple approaches the show with a problem or issue they want solved. Pictured here is couple Dyson and Rebecca . However the sex portion is not actually filmed or shown in any form. The 'box' is camera-free and soundproof.

'Our featured couples will get a once-in-a-lifetime experience, while our viewers will get the kind of bold, break-through-the-clutter programming they increasingly associate with WE tv.' According to the experts, there is an actual science to the format of the show. 'We can’t (usually) be there when [sex] is happening, but with the box, you can,' Dr Donaghue told The New York Post. 'You’re there when they’re anxious right before and can really map it out, and you’re sitting there when they come out — they’re feeling close, they’re feeling bonded — or the opposite.' Help: The experts say that straight after sex is when you're at your most open . Fun: The sex is not recorded, however the moment the couple leave the box is . Box: The show is based on a controversial British series of the same name . There will be 11 hour-long episodes and three couples will be featured. One couple fear they have lost their spark after being married for 14 years and having four children. Another share an open relationship, with one wanting to introduce S&M. Steve Wendell, 26, went on the show with his wife Sasha, 27, thinking they had lost the passion in the marriage after struggling to have children for the last six years. Sasha said she found the experience sexy and inspiring. However Steve struggled with the post-coital interview. 'It was really awkward for me, because I was sweating really bad,' he told The Post.","New reality series Sex Box premieres Friday at 10pm on WE tv .

"Incredible lost footage of an interview with one of the Cambridge Five spy ring filmed after his defection to the Soviet Union has emerged in Canada. In the film made in 1959, Guy Burgess claims he is not a traitor, but admits to being 'a socialist, a Marxist and a Bolshevik'. Burgess caused one of the biggest scandals of the Cold War when he - along with fellow double agent Donald Maclean - fled to the other side of the Iron Curtain. Scroll down for video . Footage has emerged of the Cambridge spy Guy Burgess speaking in 1959, after his defection to the USSR . The pair and three other members of Cambridge Five passed information to the Soviet Union for more than ten years and their defection was seen as a huge embarrassment for British authorities. Little is known about the pair's lives in the Soviet Union - which when they fled in 1951 was still ruled by the iron fist of tyrant Joseph Stalin. But an archivist in Canada has now uncovered an interview which the country's CBC carried out with Burgess in Moscow in 1959, in which he defends his decision to leave Britain for the USSR. In the footage, filmed four years before Burgess's death, he said: 'I want to live in the Soviet Union because I'm a socialist and it's a socialist country and I enjoy doing so. I can't imagine living in England during the Cold War.' The disgraced intelligence officer struggles to answer a question about whether he is a traitor or not, stuttering: 'Judging from the letters I get from people whose names I won't mention... they certainly don't think so.' He claims the case against him is 'hearsay' and insists he and Maclean only went to Russia as 'tourists'. The interview was filmed by a Canadian journalist in 1959 but was put into an archive for more than 50 years . Burgess (pictured, left, in his 1950s passport photo) caused one of the shocks of the Cold War when he and fellow double agent Donald Maclean fled to the Soviet Union . He insists he has no connections with the Soviet regime, but backs Communist policy by claiming they were the only side trying to 'clear things up'. The film footage backs up claims that Burgess became an alcoholic during his final years, spent cut off from the West in a small flat in Moscow. It is believed the appearance fee he charged for the interview - carried out in a cemetery in Moscow - was paid in Scotch whisky. He slurs his words at several points during the 10-minute interview and waves a cigar about during some of his answers. Wearing his Eton tie and a camel-hair overcoat, he says he would like to return to England to see his family, but only if he could be sure he would be able to return to Russia. The interview was mysteriously not reported in Britain at the time. It has now emerged that Burgess, pictured with journalist Tom Driberg in his Moscow flat after his defection, gave an interview to Canadian TV in 1959, shortly before his death . Burgess was played by actor Alan Bates in a TV adaptation of Alan Bennett's play, An Englishman Abroad . The film was then archived under the name of 'Dame Edith Sitwell', a poet who was interviewed in the same programme, and so its wider relevance was lost until now. After viewing the video, MI5's official historian Professor Christopher Andrew told the BBC the interview would have been approved by Burgess's KGB minders as a form of propaganda. He suggested that this could be the reason the interview never saw the light of day in Britain, where the media would not have wanted to aid the enemy. The 'Cambridge Five' spying scandal rocked the Establishment by revealing Soviet double agents at the heart of many of Britain's most important institutions. Kim Philby, Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean and Anthony Blunt all met at the University of Cambridge, where Blunt was an academic and the other three were undergraduates. The older man recruited the students to the Soviet cause before the Second World War - and they remained devoted to the USSR even after the start of the Cold War. Donald Maclean (left) and Kim Philby (right) were also members of the infamous Cambridge Five spy ring . Philby was head of counter-intelligence for MI6, while Maclean was a Foreign Office official and Burgess worked for the BBC. Blunt was the most eminent of all, as director of the Courtauld Institute and keeper of the royal family's art collection. In 1951, Burgess and Maclean were exposed as double agents - but after being tipped off by Philby they were able to escape to Moscow. Despite the suspicion surrounding Philby, he avoided detection until 1963, when he too defected to the USSR. Blunt escaped exposure for even longer - it was not until 1979, when Margaret Thatcher named him as a suspect in the House of Commons, that he confessed to his treachery and was stripped of his titles. The 'fifth man' in the spy ring has never been definitively identified, but was named as John Cairncross by KGB defector Oleg Gordievsky. The story of the unlikely traitors has been dramatised several times, including in John le Carré's classic book Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and a 2003 BBC series titled Cambridge Spies. Anthony Blunt (left),  the keeper of the royal family's art collection, was exposed as the fourth member of the Cambridge spy ring in 1979. The fifth member was never formally identified, although Soviet defector Oleg Gordievsky named ex-British intelligence officer John Cairncross (right) as the final link.","Key member of Cambridge Five spy ring ran off to Russia in 1951 .

"Modern sprawling metropolises with their high-rise buildings and bustling streets might at first glance appear very different from the cities that existed 2,500 years ago. New research, however, suggests that New York and London may not be all that different from the ancient cities built by civilisations like the Aztecs. Scientists have found that regardless of their location and origins in history, cities tend to grow in similar and predictable ways. Ruins of Teotihuacan (pictured), the capital of the Aztec empire, looks very different from modern cities  but the new research suggest it grew according to the same basic formula that determines city growth today . They claim this is because the social and economic drivers behind a city's expansion have been the same though out history. Urban areas are more likely to be hit by frequent thunderstorms than rural areas of the same size, according to a new study. Researchers at Northern Illinois University studied radar data to pinpoint where thunderstorm initiations occurred across the southeast US between 1997 and 2013. They found that urban areas such as Atlanta are five per cent more likely to be hit by thunderstorms, on a given day, than rural areas of the same size. Storms were more likely to hit these urbanised areas during warmer months, in July and August, in the late afternoon and early evening. And the study found more 'births' occurred during the week than at weekends. The scientists behind the work say that increased pollution in urban areas may be responsible to the increased frequency of storms. Urban areas also create 'heat islands' that can lead to storm formation. Concentrations of buildings also increase temperatures causing low pressures to form above cities, compared to high pressures in rural areas. This causes a so-called 'low-level atmospheric convergence', which forces air up into thunderstorms. Buildings may also change the flow and direction of winds, which in turn changes pressure levels and affects the upward movement of air. Their research that much like modern cities, ancient settlements were also subject to the laws of 'urban scaling'. This is where a city's population outpaces the development of infrastructure while its production of goods and services outpaces the population. Dr Scott Ortman, an anthropologist at the University of Colorado Boulder and Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico, said: 'It was shocking and unbelievable. 'We were raised on a steady diet telling us that, thanks to capitalism, industrialization, and democracy, the modern world is radically different from worlds of the past. 'What we found here is that the fundamental drivers of robust socioeconomic patterns in modern cities precede all that.' Dr Ortman and his colleagues, whose work is published in the journal Science Advances, examined archaeological data from 4,000 sites in the area around Mexico City. In the 1960s - before Mexico City's population began rapidly growing - surveyors examined all of the ancient settlements. The data spanned more than 2000 years of history from 500BC - covering the period from the Mayans to the Aztec empire before European settlers arrived in the shape of the Spanish conquistadors. The researchers used this to analyse the dimensions of hundreds of ancient temples and thousands of ancient houses to estimate populations and densities. They were also able to estimate the size and construction rate of monuments and buildings, together with intensity of use, to predict the output of each city. They found that the bigger the ancient settlement the more productive it was. Manhattan (left) is seen as a classic example of how modern capitalism and industrialisation led to city growth, but the same drivers were also at work in ancient Mayan cities that have been reclaimed by the jungle . In the pre-Hispanic settlements around Mexico city, denser populations used space more efficiently, produced goods more rapidly and were more productive per household. These results mirrored what the team have observed occurs in modern cities. The researchers say that by allowing people to sustain social interactions on a daily basis, cities make it easier for populations to solve complicated problems. Innovations like currency and literacy also tend to flow from cities and so help to speed up this process. The skyline of London (above) may look different, but the way cities bring populations together plays a crucial part in the way they expand and evolve, something that has occurred since ancient times . The findings could help to explain why ancient civilisations from different parts of the world ended up producing cities that were surprisingly similar in structure. Indeed, when Hernan Cortes saw the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan in 1521, he wrote to the Spanish king that the city was as big as Seville with surprisingly familiar boulevards, markets, canals, temples and courthouses. Professor Luis Bettencourt, a researcher in complex systems at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico who was also involved in the work, said: 'Our results suggest that the general ingredients of productivity and population density in human societies run much deeper and have everything to do with the challenges and opportunities of organizing human social networks.'","Scientists at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico studied building use and economic growth of ancient cities built by the Mayan and Aztec empires .

"The NYPD's attempt to 'retrain' 20,000 cops has been branded a 'complete waste of time' by many  officers on the force. So dull is the training, that some police officers say they are falling asleep during the three-day long course which consists mainly of eight-hour long lectures. Instead of practical, hands-on training, some cops complain they are being given unrealistic solutions to dangerous problems - such as being told to 'take a deep breath' and 'close their eyes' when dealing with angry people. Good cop, bad cop: The $35 million 'smart policing' program to retrain New York City cops in the aftermath of Eric Garner's death last July has been branded a big flop by a high-ranking NYPD official . The $35million course which was introduced last December by Mayor Bill de Blasio and Police Commissioner Bill Bratton in a bid to address criticism of the illegal chokehold maneuver that resulted in the death of the father-of-six. Once officers have completed the three-day 'smart policing' course they are asked to fill out a survey, but the results have been less than impressive, according to reports. One cop who sat through two full-day programs called them 'not realistic' and 'pretty silly.' At one point during the lectures, the cop said, those in attendance were given breathing exercises to learn how to calm down — even when facing someone who could pose a threat to their safety. 'They said if you find yourself in a situation that's getting heated, take a step back, close your eyes and take a deep breath,' he told the New York Post. 'That's pretty funny — that I would close my eyes in a tense situation.' Another cop called the lectures 'smoke and mirrors' to appease the public. 'They want you to stop and think about everything before you do anything, but a lot of times cops have to make a split-second decision, and they don't have the luxury of stopping and thinking,' the cop said. A high-ranking NYPD official – who wasn't named - told the Post that of the 2,000 surveys reviewed eight out of every ten officers have branded the exercise a waste of time. Safety measures: NYPD  Police Commissioner Bill Bratton, right, introduced the new training scheme after the Garner death, alongside New York mayo Bill de Blasio, left . The problem says the insider is that the course involves too little practical training and two days of boring eight-hour lectures that have caused some cops to fall asleep. 'It's three days, it's boring and there's no real tactics,' said the Post's source. 'They're not putting them in scenarios. Cops felt they would get more tactical training in light of the Eric Garner case.' The retraining is taking place at the brand-new, $750 million Police Academy in Queens. The disappointment comes because the there appears to very little 'hands-on, quality training on how to deal with a hostile prisoner or arrestee,' according to the Post. 'It's three days, it's boring and there's no real tactics,' he said. 'They're not putting them in scenarios. Cops felt they would get more tactical training in light of the Eric Garner case.' De Blasio has promised that his retraining program 'will have an impact on millions of people, because every interaction that every officer has with their fellow New Yorkers after they are trained again will be different.' On Day three of the course officers are taught the 'high-low takedown,' in which two cops apprehend a suspect, one from behind at the legs, the other from the front at the torso. Mayor de Blasio had ordered a review into training within the department following Garner's death. Redeployed: MIchael Julian, pictured, tried to introduce a number of controversial new training methods within the NYPD following the July 2014 death of Staten Island man Eric Garner who died as he was arrested . The 43-year-old died after NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo placed him in a illegal chokehold during an attempted arrest on Staten Island on July 17, 2014. Officers were attempting to arrest Garner because they suspected he had been selling untaxed cigarettes illegally. 'The training that's going to happen here in this building will change the future of this city,' said de Blasio when he introduced the scheme. 'It will have not just an impact on thousands of people, it will have an impact on millions of people, because every interaction that every officer has with their fellow New Yorkers after they are trained again will be different.' A deputy NYPD commissioner appointed to reform the department in the wake of Garner's death has lasted just two months in the job, it was announced at the weekend. Michael Julian has been moved to a less controversial position after he proposed officers be supplied with breath mints to prevent them from swearing and that protesters should be sprayed with baby oil so they would be easier to remove.. A source told the New York Post: 'He would come up with these wacky ideas. We would roll our eyes and move on.' Julian ordered 10,000 individually wrapped breath mints which were delivered to the NYPD headquarters building. The mints were due to be deployed to individual officers, who would then be instructed to unpeel the wrapper if they felt the urge to swear. Julian believed that by the time the officer had unwrapped the mint and placed it into his mouth, he would no longer want to curse. Earlier he had suggested that police should deploy baby oil in situations when protesters link arms and sit down. He claimed that the baby oil would prevent the protesters from hanging onto each other and officers with rubber gloves could remove them easily. It is understood that Julian was removed from his position as deputy commissioner for training following the gaffes and transferred to the personnel department.","Eric Garner died last July when police officers used a chokehold while attempting to arrest him .

"It was the legendary Tudor manor that came to epitomise the  ruthless world of Henry VIII's adviser Thomas Cromwell and inspired Hilary Mantel's novel Wolf Hall. But while the timber-framed medieval house Henry's third wife Jane Seymour once called home has been lost to history, a family home still exists on the estate depicted in the BBC's historical drama - complete with underground passages, creaking floorboards and even a ghost. Wolf Hall Manor, in Burbage, Wiltshire, stands close to the site of the Seymour family seat and is named after the original house. But the royal knights and regal splendour have gone - replaced by trampolines and wonky basketball hoops in the manor's overgrown garden. This is Wolf Hall Manor, which stands close to the site of the Tudor mansion which Henry VIII's third wife Jane Seymour called home . The timber-framed medieval house that was home to the Seymours has been lost to history, but a family house still exists on the estate depicted in the BBC's historical drama - complete with underground passages, creaking floorboards and even a ghost . The property is now home to the Binney family, three brothers and a sister, who have not seen any of the series staring Damian Lewis as Henry VIII and Mark Rylance as Cromwell, and admit the house is now a 'bit of a mess'. The 12-bedroom manor passed to Dominic Binney, 30, and his siblings Theo, 25, Orlando, 23, and Genevieve, 20, when their mother passed away in 2013. Dominic, who grew up in Wolf Hall Manor, is now working to clear and clean the estate. 'The house has been neglected a bit over the last 10 years,' he said. 'We've got lots of bills to pay and lots of work to do to the house. The property is now home to the Binney family, three brothers and a sister, who have not seen any of the series staring Damian Lewis (left) as Henry VIII and Mark Rylance as Thomas Cromwell (right) Wolf Hall Manor, in Burbage, Wiltshire, stands close to the site of the Seymour family seat and is named after the original house . The original Wolf Hall was inhabited by servants after the Seymours left and became increasingly dilapidated until it was largely demolished in 1665 to build nearby Tottenham House for the Seymours before the turn of the century . The manor, which features this atmospheric staircase, passed to Dominic Binney, 30, and his siblings Theo, 25, Orlando, 23, and Genevieve, 20, when their mother passed away in 2013 . 'To be honest, I feel too young to be running this place. We are just trying to clean up the house and not because of the attention. 'It's not collapsing but the whole place is going to be shaped up. The garden needs a lot of seeing to. 'Tenants did what they wanted and we need to change it all. It's a bit of a mess to be honest and it's now time to clean up.' Like Wolf Hall Manor, Dame Hilary's novel is named after the Seymour's original home, also called Wulfhall. Henry VIII stayed there in the summer of 1535 - when Jane caught his eye, prompting the king to begin wooing her and plotting the demise of second wife Anne Boleyn after this visit, according to historians. According to historians, Henry VIII stayed at Wolf Hall in the summer of 1535 - when Jane, played in the BBC drama by Kate  Philips, caught his eye . The meeting was shown on last week's Wolf Hall episode, but sparked comments from some fans who complained over the language used - notably the use of the C-word during a discussion between courtiers about Jane. As the king looked out of the window at his future bride, he mused: 'Does not Mistress Seymour have the tiniest hands?' While he walked away, courtiers mocked him behind his back, with one saying: 'Does she not have the whitest throat?' At that point, one nobleman joked: ‘Has she not got the wettest c*** you ever groped?’ A spokesman for the BBC said: 'Wolf Hall is broadcast after the watershed and the language in this powerful scene was taken from Hilary Mantel’s original text.' Local folklore says the royal couple held a celebratory wedding feast in Wolf Hall's gigantic barn, before the Seymours abandoned their home in the late 16 century for nearby Tottenham House. 'We don't know what happened here - good things, bad things,' said Dominic. 'What secrets buried in the dirt, you just don't know. A lot of the men who lived here were apparently beheaded. 'Over the years we have had many people feeling a presence here that makes their hair stand on end - something that is definitely not explained by an old house's sounds and creaky floorboards. 'I've absolutely felt and heard unexplained things. We had mediums and psychics come here to chase the ghosts away.' There is no surviving picture of Wolf Hall as King Henry saw it, but historians believe it was a timber-framed house with a long gallery, chapel, kennel and a tower. The accompanying ancient barn, which was said to have the original hooks that decorations and tapestries had hung from, lasted longer than the house, but burnt down in the 1920s. The red brick Wolfhall Farmhouse, 200 metres away from the current Wolf Hall Manor, is a listed building for its 16th century origins - notably tall, Tudor chimneys. The original Wolf Hall was inhabited by servants after the Seymours  left and became increasingly dilapidated until it was largely demolished in 1665 to build nearby Tottenham House for the Seymours before the turn of the century. 'We are not quite sure where the original house was,' Dominic's grandmother Anne Elizabeth Binney, 88, said. 'We are all a bit confused.' Dominic's grandparents first acquired the house in 1940s, and the family believe the 4ft high underground passages leading from the house  might connect to  Tottenham House. 'People say the passageways are Tudor. They're older than the foundations of this building,' Dominic said. Over the last ten years, the house fell into disrepair as his mother struggled to maintain it. Seven people live in the main house, which has been partitioned for tenants and several families live in other estate buildings. The family believe underground passages leading from the house might connect to the Seymours' later home, Tottenham House . The four foot high passageways are believed to be Tudor, and pre-date the rest of the house, including its foundations . Washing lines with colourful pegs traverse the front lawn, in which one tenant has planted gnomes. A dragon and a witches broom also greet visitors at Wolf Hall's official front door - also courtesy of a resident - while a few trampolines and a wonky basketball hoop lie in the garden along with an old stove and a stack of chairs. There is also an overgrown tennis court and a secret garden, encircled by ivy-covered walls - outside of which sit tenants' cars and a broken swing set. Dominic has neither read Wolf Hall, nor watched the adaptation, which is set to reach a bloody conclusion tomorrow night. Family grandmother Anne Binney, 88, said she 'very much' liked Dame Hilary's first book Wolf Hall and has been watching the BBC2 drama, which is also based on the novel's sequel Bring Up The Bodies . There is no surviving picture of Wolf Hall as King Henry saw it, but historians believe it was a timber-framed house with a long gallery, chapel, kennel and a tower . 'I think it's nice it people are enjoying it. But it's fiction, it isn't genuine. I don't watch TV,' he said. His grandmother, however, 'very much' liked Dame Hilary's first book Wolf Hall and has been watching the BBC2 drama, which is based on the novel's sequel Bring Up The Bodies. She said: 'I don't like the television programme; I just think they get things wrong. I shall watch the rest though. Mrs Binney bought a collection of wooden portraits of Henry VIII and his six wives - copies of Holbein pictures - when she lived in the house, which now sit above the kitchen door. Old industrial equipment (left) stands in the overgrown garden of the house, which is home to seven tenants . The only other remnant of Wolf Hall's Tudor past is the eerie feeling people have had in the house, although would-be treasure hunters have scoured the estate with metal detectors in the hope of finding Tudor gold . The only other remnant of Wolf Hall's Tudor past is the eerie feeling people have had in the house, although would-be treasure hunters have scoured the estate with metal detectors in the hope of finding Tudor gold. 'They haven't found anything so far but I think there is bound to be a big pot of gold hidden here somewhere,' Dominic added. Dominic hopes that one the estate is cleaned up that they might open the gardens to the public or use the buildings to set up a petting zoo. 'Locally, we [the estate] haven't got an amazing reputation but we would like to change that,' he said.","Wolf Hall Manor in Burbage, Wiltshire, stands close to the site of Jane Seymour's medieval family seat .

"He's as famous for his extravagant lifestyle as he is his signature designs. With London Fashion Week in full swing, Karl Lagerfeld's favourite muse has lifted the lid on what life is really like with the head designer of fashion houses Chanel and Fendi. Model Brad Kroenig is the most senior member of an elite group of male models known as 'Karl's boys' and with his six-year-old son Hudson he travels the world in Lagerfeld's private jet attending fashion shows and exclusive parties. Karl Lagerfeld (centre) with his muse Brad Kroenig (behind left) and godson Hudson Kroenig (front left) out for a stroll in Saint Tropez in 2012 . In an interview in The Times's Saturday magazine, Kroenig reveals how the designer likes to lavish gifts on his 'boys', with a rose-gold Rolex and a diamond bracelet by Chrome Hearts, Lagerfeld's favourite jewellery brand, among his latest presents. Kroenig, whom Lagerfeld once shot as the Greek god Zeus and compiled the photos in a four-volume book devoted entirely to his muse, said: 'Karl is really generous. He likes his friends to look chic.' Kroenig's son Hudson is Lagerfeld's godson and has been appearing in Chanel shows since he was two. It is reported Karl walks around with a portable Polaroid printer and he has gifted Hudson with one too. But he tells the little boy off when he tries to use the camera to take selfies saying: 'I hate selfies. Don't use your film for ugly purpose.' And even when they're not together it's been reported that Karl lavishes the little boy with gifts. It's been said he gave him a toy version of himself and fills Hudson's wardrobe with Chanel and Fendi clothes. Lagerfeld, who designs 17 collections a year and until recently only communicated with friends by fax, stunned onlookers when he draped the youngster in layers of diamonds worth $1.5million on Chanel's 2015 resort collection runway in Dubai in May 2014. Karl is known for his love of wearing his trademark dark sunglasses every day . Much has been made of Lagerfeld's relationship with Kroenig and Hudson. The profile of Lagerfeld detailed how the designer would fly the pair around on his private jet. In the piece Lagerfeld, who is famous for his acerbic put-downs, said he prefers the company of models because: 'I hate ugly people. Very depressing.' Indeed, Kroenig and his son not only accompany Karl around the world to various shows and parties but also on his holidays to St Tropez. It's a relationship that doesn't seem to bother Kroenig's wife, Nicole, who stays at home in New Jersey as her husband flies around the world with the designer. Karl with his cat Choupette - who he told CNN that he wished he could marry . He told The Times of his relationship with the models: 'I see the boys like family. I have no family at all, so it's good to have, like, sons, but without the unpleasant problems sons can create.' As well as covering his models in diamonds, Lagerfeld once had a cast of the model Baptiste Giabiconi made out of chocolate. Indeed, when Lagerfeld takes to someone, they can rely on his endless support. From Cara Delevingne to Kendall Jenner, he has had many a muse. He tends to like strong women, from Rita Ora for whom he created a dress named, The Ora, to Kristen Stewart who starred in his Chanel Dallas campaign. Singer Lily Allen has also long been a close confident of the designer. It is rumoured that they met at a party where she drunkenly asked him to draw her a diagram of how to make shoes. She landed a Chanel campaign and when she married in 2011 she wore a custom Chanel gown for part of the day. Karl kisses a model wearing a Chanel wedding gown during one of his shows in 2014 . Karl  (centre) attends the Coca-Cola Light & Karl Lagerfeld  Collaboration in 2011 in Paris . Lagerfeld's own life is as gilded as it is regimented. He has a butler who wears a white coat and tie and travels ahead of him, greeting him with a chilled wine glass of Diet Coke. In an interview with Harper's Bazaar he once revealed that he has to sleep for seven hours a day, every day. He follows a strict diet which starts with two protein shakes and steamed apples and he refuses to drink hot drinks. Lagerfeld famously lost six and a half stone saying that he did so so that he could, 'be a good clothes horse.' Karl famously lost six and a half stone saying that he wanted to be a better clothes horse . His hair, which he has pulled back into a pony-tail every day, is not actually the white hue it seems, in fact he has previously admitted that he sprays it every day with masses of dry shampoo to achieve the colour. But while the fashion designer, whose black trousers feature a microprint of his own likeness, is undoubtedly one of the most famous in the world, he is in danger of being usurped by his cat Choupette. The Siamese cat has her own Twitter account and a range of accessories in her image including shopping bags and wallets. Choupette has her own wikipeadia page and was originally owned by Baptiste. In an interview with CNN in 2011 Karl revealed he wished he could marry the cat. He said: 'There is no marriage, yet, for human beings and animals… I never thought that I would fall in love like this with a cat.' Brad and Hudson Kroenig on the Chanel catwalk in 2012 .

"The days of kids with missing teeth looking under their pillows to find a shiny quarter from the Tooth Fairy are over, nowadays the winged, dust-wielding fairy is shelling out the big bucks, a recent survey says. A recent survey by oral-healthcare company Sunstar Gum found that parents across the country are digging deeper into their pockets when their little ones lose a tooth. However, the amount varies across the country with kids in New York city raking in $13.25 for every molar, bicuspid, or incisor, according to Yahoo Parenting. Tooth: A recent survey by oral-healthcare company Sunstar Gum found that parents across the country are digging deeper into their pockets when their little ones lose a tooth (stock image) 'This is New York City,' one mother of three told the New York Daily News. 'So in other parts of the country, people give $2 or $5, but here, it's double and even triple that.' The company questioned 1,000 families earlier this month, focusing on five cities: New York City, NY; Los Angeles, CA.; Boston, MA, Chicago, IL. and Dallas/Houston, TX. The survey found that, in Los Angeles,  kid's teeth go for, on average, $9.69, Chicago ($5.85), Dallas/Houston ($5.28), and Boston ($5.02).

In fact, some of Yahoo Parenting's respondents were outraged by the city folk's excessive payments. During an informal Facebook survey on the matter, parents around the country recalled their own days as gap-toothed children, receiving quarters from the Tooth Fairy. A Colorado mom wrote: '$13??? $13!!! Not here!! We leave $5 and I cringe at that.' Though some may cringe at the tooth fairy's lavish payouts, experts at Delta Dental Plans Association say her generosity has increased since 2013. Delta Dental's most recent 'The Original Tooth Fairy Poll' found that the Tooth Fairy left $225 million under kid's pillows nationwide last year, according to CNBC.

"Islamic State militants have kidnapped at least 90 people after sweeping through Christian villages in Syria, it has been revealed. The abductions are said to have taken place after ISIS seized two Assyrian communities from Kurdish forces in the northeast province of Hassakeh. Dawn raids on Monday are said to have spread 'panic' in the villages, inhabited by the ancient Christian minority along the banks of the Khabur River near the town of Tel Hmar. Most of the captives are said to have came from the village of Tal Shamiram, located 50 miles miles southwest of the Hassakeh provincial capital of Qamishli, with others taken from Tal Hermuz. Scroll down for video . Brutal: The raid comes after Isis released a video showing militants beheading 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians in Libya . Most of the captives are said to have came from the village of Tal Shamiram, located 50 miles miles southwest of the Hassakeh provincial capital of Qamishli, with others taken from Tal Hermuz . The kidnappings were revealed by the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The latest offensive coincides with a push by Syrian Kurds in the northeast near the Iraqi border since Sunday that had compounded losses for the militant group in Syria. Sources are reported to have told the human rights watchdog that jihadists swooped to abduct dozens of civilians from the village of Tal Shamiram. Nuri Kino, founder of A Demand for Action (ADFA), said the Syrian villages had been attacked at 5am with 3,000 people 'displaced'. The organisation, which campaigns for Assyrians, Chaldeans and Syriacs in the country, said 'refugees and fighters' had been in touch with relatives in Sweden, Germany and Canada to confirm the figures. Mr Kino said between 70 and 100 people - mostly women and children - had been taken away while the men that were abducted were transported to the Abd al-Aziz mountains. Islamic State militants have kidnapped at least 90 people from Christian villages in Syria, it has been revealed (file picture) He told Newsweek how witnesses had described the Isis force as 'massive' and that an atmosphere of 'panic' had spread throughout the villages. It has been reported that the extremists had demanded a prisoner swap with the Kurdish fighters. An Assyrian woman from Tal Shamiram who now lives in Beirut said she has been scrambling to find out what has become of her parents as well as her brother and his wife and kids. 'Land lines have been cut, their mobiles are closed,' she told The Associated Press. 'Have they been slaughtered? Are they still alive? We're searching for any news.' She spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of endangering relatives believed to be held by the militants. 'My family visited me last month and returned to Syria. There were clashes but it was normal, nothing exceptional. I feel so helpless, I cannot do anything for them but pray,' she said by telephone. The Islamic State group's online radio station, al-Bayan, said in a report today that IS fighters had detained 'tens of crusaders' and seized 10 villages around Tal Tamr after clashes with Kurdish militiamen. ISIS frequently refers to Christians as 'crusaders.' The Islamic State group has destroyed churches and Christian shrines in Syria, and demanded that Christians living under its rule pay a tax known as jizya . ISIS has destroyed churches and Christian shrines in Syria, and demanded that Christians living under its rule pay a tax known as jizya. Much of Hassakeh is divided between Kurdish and IS control. Fighters from the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) have been on the offensive in the province in recent days. They have taken 24 villages and hamlets as part of an operation to try to recapture the town of Tal Hamis and surrounding areas. Tal Hamis lies to the east of the villages taken by IS on Tuesday. YPG forces have also been on the offensive in Raqa province, which neighbours Hassakeh, seizing 19 villages as they advance following their recapture of the strategic border town of Kobane last month. The Kurdish forces have been backed by US-led air strikes launched by the international coalition fighting IS. The Observatory said the coalition carried out a series of strikes around Tal Hamis on Tuesday that killed 14 IS members. Earlier this month Islamic State released a video purporting to show the militant group beheading 21 . Egyptian Christians kidnapped in Libya. The video showed ISIS fighters dressed head to toe in black, marching the captives, all wearing orange jumpsuits, to a beach. The 21 men were forced onto their knees before being beheaded by the militants.","Islamic State militants launched dawn raid on Syrian villages, reports claim .

"A French woman working for an international organisation in Yemen has been kidnapped, France's foreign ministry announced. The 30-year-old and her local guide were abducted by unidentified gunmen on Tuesday morning as they traveled to work by taxi in the capital Sanaa. 'We unfortunately confirm the kidnapping this morning, in Sanaa, of a French national working for an international organisation,' the French Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

Kidnapped: The 30-year-old and her local guide were abducted by unidentified gunmen on Tuesday morning as they traveled to work by taxi in the capital Sanaa . 'We are fully mobilised to try and locate her and ensure a speedy liberation.' President Francois Hollande, who spoke at a news conference, revealed she worked for the World Bank and called for her safe return. It comes as Paris is on alert for a new terror attack after 'at least' five drones were spotted illegally flying around city landmarks, including the Eiffel Tower, Bastille Square and the U.S. embassy building. 'She was kidnapped in front of a ministry in Yemen,' he said. 'We ask for her to be released as soon as possible, we are trying to locate her and will do all we can for her to be freed.' Yemen has descended into chaos since Shiite Huthi militia swept into Sanaa from their mountainous northern stronghold last year. The Huthis overran the capital in September and installed a 'presidential council' earlier this month after President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi and Prime Minister Khalid Bahah tendered their resignations. Since then, France has joined countries such as Saudi Arabia, the United States, Egypt and Germany in closing its embassy in Sanaa. In recent years tribesmen have often taken foreigners hostage to press the government to provide them with services or to free jailed relatives. The country is also home to one of the most active branches of al Qaeda, which has also targeted foreigners. In France, unmanned aircraft were also spotted flying overnight near the French capital's Place de la Concorde and the Invalides military museum, where Napoleon Bonaparte is buried.

"One 10-year-old Girl Scout deserves a badge for bravery after she attempted to stop a thief who stole $300 right off her hands while her troop sold cookies outside a grocery store. Sophia Contos got into a tug-of-war with Cody Phillip Gintz as she tried to hold on tight to the scouts' cash box, but the man was too strong and pulled it away, according to police. Contos said she had noticed him eyeing the box earlier while the troop was outside a San Jose, California Safeway, and did her best to guard it. Scroll down for video . Girl Scout Sophia Contos, 10, tried to stop Cody Phillip Gintz from stealing the troop's cash box, which had $300 inside, as they sold cookies outside a grocery store . Contos said she had noticed Gintz eyeing the box earlier and tried to protect it  but Gintz suddenly went for it. 'I jerk it away but he's too strong and he gets it,' she said . Gintz returned to the parking lot after throwing the cash box in a nearby creek. That's when Contos' mom, who was with the troop (pictured), saw his car and memorized his license plate . 'I keep my hands on the box and start to pull it away and all of a sudden he goes for it,' she told NBC Bay Area. 'I jerk it away but he’s too strong and he gets it.' Gintz, 23, was arrested for strong arm robbery. He said he stole the money because he was 'desperate' for a fix for his daily heroin habit . Contos yelled as Gintz got away. The 23-year-old then stashed the camouflage-print box, decorated with a silver star, in a nearby creek before he returned to Safeway's parking lot to retrieve his truck, authorities say. That's when Contos' mom Michelle said she spotted the familiar face and began reading his license plate 'over and over again' to memorize the numbers. Police then quickly spotted Gintz's truck and pulled him over. They found the $300 on him and arrested Gintz for strong arm robbery. Gintz said he immediately confessed to the police and told them where to find the cash box, later retrieved by a K-9. Gintz said he stole the money because he 'needed a fix really bad' for his daily heroin habit, but didn't have any money. He said the incident was the first time he had stolen money for drugs. 'It kind of takes over a lot of you, including your rational thought process,' he said in an exclusive interview with NBC Bay Area in jail, where he showed visible withdrawal symptoms from the drug. 'Normally I would never even try, but I was desperate so I tried.' Gintz said afterwards he immediately knew what he did was wrong. San Jose police returned the $300 to the troop, with an extra $60 donation, and then bought the remaining $240 worth of cookies they still had left . Gintz told police where he hid the cash box (pictured) and a K-9 retrieved it from the creek. The troop is currently raising money for a water conservation project . 'The reason why I feel bad is because my little sister was a Girl Scout and it just reminded me of her after I did that,' he said. Gintz said he would tell the girls he was sorry and that he hoped Contos had suffered no 'emotional trauma'. Contos admitted she had been shaken up by the robbery. 'I didn't really know that a guy would do that,' she told NBC. 'That there were people around here who would do such a thing.' 'It just made me feel bad.' But the San Jose police were on hand to cheer Sophia and her fellow Girl Scouts up. Not only was the $300 returned to the troop, but the police bought the remaining $240 worth of cookies they still had left. They also added an extra $60 donation.

"A man tried to punch his own brother during a drunken fight at a house party - only to miss and accidentally kill one of his best friends who was trying to separate them. William Lynch, 41, took a swing at his brother, Andrew, but instead hit 62-year old Derek Szostok, who had stepped in when the siblings' 'childish row' turned violent. Mr Szostok, who lived in the flat below Lynch, suffered a fractured neck and skull when the force of the punch knocked him on to the stairwell. He died four days later. Close: William Lynch, left, accidentally hit his neighbour Derek Szostok, right, when Mr Szostok tried to break up a drunken fight at a house party. Mr Szostok, 62, suffered a fractured neck and skull during the scuffle . He underwent a 10-hour operation but suffered a fatal stroke and his life support machine was turned off four days later. Lynch, from Wigan, Greater Manchester was yesterday jailed for four years and three months after being convicted of manslaughter following a trial at Liverpool Crown Court. Police said Lynch, locally known as Billy, had lived in a flat above Mr Szostok and the two were close friends. Lynch said he regarded Mr Szostok as a 'father-type figure' and that they often socialised. Witnesses said Lynch and his brother Andrew got into a drunken argument at the house party last August. It escalated when Lynch  threw a coffee table and put his foot through a TV screen, demanding that guests leave. Mr Szostok stood up to separate the two brothers but was pushed to the ground by Lynch during the scuffle, which spilled out into the corridor outside. House party: The fight broke out during a house party at Lynch's flat in Wigan, Greater Manchester, pictured, last August. Mr Szostok stepped in when the 'childish row' escalated and Lynch threw a coffee table . After Mr Szostok hit his head, Lynch phoned emergency services and told the operator: 'I have hit my neighbour hard, he's paralysed. I didn't mean it.' Mr Szostok initially responded to treatment but his condition deteriorated and he died on 30 August 2014. A post-mortem examination later established he had died as a result of 'flexation of the neck'. Defending Lynch, Richard English said his client had vowed never to drink again. He said of Lynch and the victim: 'They were truly great friends and beyond that. 'They regarded each other almost as akin to father and son, and when in hospital Mr Szostock spoke of ""his son"" and loved him in that role. Jailed: Lynch, from Wigan, Greater Manchester was sentenced to four years and three months in prison . 'While nothing can come close to the loss of a brother and member of your family the loss Mr Lynch bears is very great. 'He has not only lost a loved friend but he bears the burden of having been the cause of that and that is a very heavy burden for anyone to have. 'It has scarred him and he will bear that scar for the rest of his life.' Sentencing, Judge Mark Brown described Mr Szostok as a 'kind soul' and told Lynch: 'You swung a blow at your brother but struck Mr Szostok instead. 'I accept you did not intend to hit him and there was no animosity directed towards him. Your actions were reckless.' After the case, Detective Chief Inspector Howard Millington of Greater Manchester Police said: 'This is an extremely sad case, the facts of which paint a tragic picture of excessive alcohol consumption. 'Lynch looked up to Derek as a sort of father-figure, and the two were close, which make's Derek death even more tragic. 'It is clear that Derek was trying to play peacemaker between two brothers whose argument had turned violent. 'He was therefore an innocent victim caught up in a row not of his own making, and sadly in trying to diffuse the row he has been pushed to the ground and suffered a fatal injury. 'It is a very sad case and I would like to extend my condolences to all of Derek's family for the loss they have suffered. I can only hope today gives them some sense of closure following his death. 'What this case does show is that a combination of alcohol and violence can be a lethal mix.' In a statement, Mr Szostok's sister, Marie, said: 'Derek was a beautiful person inside and out. 'He had his flaws, as do we all, but he was a kind soul, often described as a good lad and always there for his family. 'He was kind, loving, loyal and the life and soul of every family party. We will miss him forever.'","William Lynch was trying to punch his brother Andrew during drunken fight .

"The Veteran Affairs Inspector General is investigating a department hospital in Wisconsin amid allegations it has been over-prescribing powerful painkillers. Nicknamed 'Candy Land' because of its pill policy, the US Department of Veteran Affairs Medical Center in Tomah has been linked to three deaths in the last three years. Marine Corps veteran Jason Simcakoski, 35, died of an overdose in the psychiatric ward of the hospital six months ago. Marine veteran Jason Simcakowski (pictured) overdosed in the psychiatric ward at the US Department of Veteran Affairs Medical Center in Tomah, Wisconsin, six months ago . Simcakowski is the third hospital patient to die. Thomas Baer died last month and Jacob Ward died in 2013 . Opiate prescriptions at the Wisconsin hospital (pictured) almost quadrupled over an eight-year period . Hospital patient Thomas Baer, 74, died last month and Jacob Ward, 27,  died in 2013. Opiate prescriptions at the hospital almost quadrupled over an eight-year period, NBC News reported. The number of Oxycodone pills prescribed jumped from 50,000 in 2004 to 712,000 in 2012, according to the Center for Investigative Reporting. In addition to deaths of patients, the Inspector General reported veterans living in the area had been found dead by police surrounded by 'large quantities of prescribed controlled substances'. An Air Force veteran who is a patient, Jason Bishop, said: 'They're breeding drug addicts.' Hospital chief of staff Dr David Houlihan, who is known as the 'Candy Man', has been removed from his post. Houlihan said in January: 'The problem is there is a lot of chronic pain. 'You don't hear a lot of veterans complaining about me.'

Simcakoski's family is complaining about the doctor after an autopsy revealed their son, a married father with an 11-year-old daughter, died from 'mixed drug toxicity'. His mother, Linda Simcakoski, said: 'I just feel that he didn't have a chance. 'We trusted them and we expected them to know what to do and it just seems like they just kept giving him more and more.' Simcakoskis family want justice for their son, his wife and their 11-year-old daughter (pictured) After a previous investigation, the VA Inspector General said there was a 'considerable variance' in the number of pain pills prescribed by Houlihan, but stopped short of saying he did anything criminal. The VA said: 'Although the allegations dealing with general overuse of narcotics at the facility may have had some merit they do not constitute proof of wrongdoing. 'We did not find any conclusive evidence affirming criminal activity, gross clinical incompetence or negligence, or administrative practices that were illegal or violated personnel policies.' Despite the allegations and investigation, hospital director Mario DeSanctis received a $8,025 bonus. Marvin Simcakoski, the dead Marine's father, said of DeSanctis: . 'I can't believe he would think it was OK to have his own son on that many medications. 'If he's the boss then he should be held responsible.'

Scroll down for video . Life-changing: Sidney Good poses alongside her friend Alexis Fairchild before the parasailing accident in July 2013, which left both girls with grain damage. Both girls have now reached a settlement in their lawsuit . Terrifying: The girls' parasail snapped off and sent them into a condo before they crashed to the ground . Crash: After smashing into the condo, the girls crashed down on this car. They both suffered brain damage . Good's lawyer Wes Pittman would not reveal the exact settlement amount, but told the station WANE both girls will live comfortably for their rest of their lives. 'The girls are taken care of as well as money can take care of them and they have reasonable futures ahead of them,' said Mr Pittman. After multiple surgeries and a lengthy rehabilitation period, Alexis and Sidney continue to struggle every day with the after-effects of their injuries. Although Good and Fairchild graduated from high school last year, both read only at a grade-school level, and Sidney also suffers from permanent damage to her vision that cannot be cured. ‘They had some huge assistance in getting the final classes done so that they could graduate from high school,’ her lawyer revealed to the station WJHG. Broken: Fairchild (pictured in the hospital) and her friend have undergone several operations to repair some of the damage from the crash . Alexis, a high school graduate, reads at a grade-school level as a result of her brain trauma . Good has since enrolled in cosmetology school, while Fairchild is hoping to get into college in the near future. While little is known about the conditions of the settlement, Sidney Good's attorney said that five defendants had been named in the lawsuit, including the parasailing ride operator, a business located on the beach, a rope manufacturer, the wholesaler of the rope and the condominium into which the teenagers smashed. Sidney Good returned to Panama City in July 2014 to thank doctors and nurses at Bay Medical Center who helped save her life and nurse her back to health. Good's mother, Amy, said during the emotional reunion that doctors hadn't been sure how successful her daughter's recovery would be. 'We didn’t know if she could walk or talk,' Amy Good said. 'They told us she may not remember.' But both girls, who are no longer as close as they were, impressed their medical staff and families when they walked on stage during the graduation at Huntington North High School June 6, 2014. Battle: Good, pictured in hospital, suffered spinal injuries and doctors did not know if she would walk again . New chapter: Good (pictured left before crash and right this month) has enrolled in cosmetology school . Fighting back: Good, pictured in May 2014, returned home to Indiana and has fought to regain her abilities . But although they were on their feet, they still suffers from the aftermath of the accident. 'Both girls have brain damage,' Wes Pittman told WJHG last summer. 'One reads at a 5th to 6th grade level even though they have both . graduated from high school. The other one reads at a third to fourth . grade level.' Hopeful: Despite her struggles, Alexis is hoping to begin college in the near future . He went on: 'Both have serious orthopedic injuries, spinal surgeries with more . coming, titanium plates and screws because of the multiple facial . fractures. Her optic nerves were damaged and she sees only right down . the center of what you're looking at between my two hands right now.' Attorneys for the girls claim that the parasailing company was negligent for taking the girls out during dangerous weather and for driving the boat too close to the shore with unsafe equipment. The girls became detached from the boat when their boat dropped anchor due to unusually high and dangerous winds and their line snapped. They underwent multiple operations for their injuries, and Alexis was eventually able to leave Bay Medical Center in Panama City, Florida in mid-July while Sidney remained for another week. Both girls then returned home to Huntington, Indiana, where they have continued to undergo treatment as out patients. A National Transportation Safety Board report has also criticized the parasailing industry, accusing operators of 'poor judgment, lack of sufficient experience [and] proper training'. 'Passengers seeking to enjoy the thrill, adventure and panoramic views of parasailing risk becoming accident victims,' the NTSB report said. 'Due to the nature of parasailing, accidents usually result in either serious injury or death.' There are no federal guidelines regulating parasailing and now the NTSB is recommending that all operators be licensed by the US Coast Guard. See below for video .

"California police discovered a hidden cave with illegal gambling machines and guns after being called to a house for suspected domestic violence. Officers in Fresno arrived at a house where yelling had been reported and saw that two men were running around inside after they first met a scared woman and child. Police did not find the suspects but discovered the two men when they found that a chicken coop on skateboard wheels outside one of the walls concealed an underground lair. A chicken coop on skateboard wheels obscured a narrow staircase (pictured) and an underground lair with guns and surveillance equipment . Officers saw two men running around inside the home but then could not find them when they entered to see if anyone was hurt. They were later found in the hidden cave . A secret staircase led to a room with TV surveillance of other parts of the house, guns, ammunition, illegal gambling machines and tools. Marijuana plants were found Saturday night in the house's garage, though police say no evidence of a drug lab was found in the lair. Daniel Marquez, 39, was arrested on three counts of felony child endangerment. Kue Vang, 33, was booked on one count of gambling machines, two counts of filing down gun serial numbers and three counts of child endangerment. Officers say that the lair was hand-dug by the suspects and that the hidden cave was structurally unsafe . Kue Vang, 33, faces one count of gambling machines and two counts of filing down gun serial numbers . Lee Khammany, 33, was arrested for a probation violation. The suspects were taken from the house, which is located next to an elementary school, without incident. Police said that the lair, which the suspects were still in the middle of digging by hand, was structurally unsafe, according to KFSN. Battalion Chief Thomas Cop said that it reminded him of Forestiere Underground Gardens, a collection of catacomb-like passageways and rooms built in Fresno by artist Baldassare Forestiere in the early 20th century.

"Italians have reacted furiously to a navy publicity campaign which uses English to urge recruits to 'be cool' and join the force. The prominent recruitment drive, which has been plastered across billboards and posters around the country, uses the phrase 'Be cool and join the navy' to entice would-be sailors into joining the Marina Militare, the official name for the Italian navy. The defence minister behind the campaign said the language would appeal to the younger generation, who have grown up communicating over the internet. But a wave of right-wing MPs and commentators have blasted the campaign, claiming it has 'wounded patriotism' and sparked 'anger and disgust'. Controversial: Italians have reacted angrily after the country's Marina Militare - the navy - launched a recruitment campaign using the slogan 'Be cool and join the navy' in English . They are incensed not only by the use of English on the posters, but also by the use of the word 'navy' as opposed to the official Marina Militare. Others are outraged by the phrase 'be cool', with one chiding: 'Are we an American colony now?' Fabio Rampelli, an MP with the right-wing Fratelli d'Italia, told parliament the slogan was 'unacceptable' and that defence minister Roberta Pinotti should be suspended for 'wounding patriotism'. He said: 'I ask myself how it came into the mind of the Italian navy to launch, with our money, a campaign in the English language to recruit young people.' He had first started speaking in English, before switching to Italian and saying: 'If I continued like that the Speaker would have stopped me.' The campaign  uses photographs which show young Italian commandos hard at work. There are also images of Italian warships travelling through the water. The phrase, which is written in English rather than Italian, appears on campaigns and posters which depict young commandos as underwater frogmen (left) and hard in training (right) Fabio Rampelli, an MP with the right-wing Fratelli d'Italia, said the Defence Minister Roberta Pinotti should be suspended for 'wounding patriotism' through the campaign . But Basilio Catanoso, an MP from Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party, said the poster caused 'anger, annoyance, disgust and sadness'. He added that it had been upsetting to see the Marina Militare 'transformed into the navy' and that the force must push for progress in its weapons, rather than its use of language. Annamaria Testa, an advertising consultant and communications expert, also told Italian newspaper La Repubblica that there were plenty of Italian phrases which could have been used as an alternative to the phrase 'be cool'. According to The Daily Telegraph, she said the use of the phrase was 'like putting ketchup on macaroni'. The promient campaign, displayed all over the country, also shows Italian warships travelling through water . Dozens of Italians have also criticised the campaign, using the navy's Facebook page to express their derision. One wrote: 'Are we now an American colony?' while another said: 'How can you claim to be proud of our country if you do not use even more our national language?' In response to the criticism, Mrs Pinotti defended the move, saying the campaign was meant to appeal to tech-savvy young people who grew up interacting online. 'English was chosen because it's a differentiating factor compared to the traditional image of the navy,' she said. She added that applications had risen by 20 per cent compared to last year.","Marina Militare, Italy's navy, launched prominent poster recruitment drive .

"From a four-bedroom bungalow in Atlanta all the way to a tiny studio apartment in New York City, these are examples of just some of the properties on the American market that will set you back less than $125,000. The list, compiled by real estate website Zillow, shows that citizens can buy a spacious family home with a stylish interior for a relatively low price. On the flipside however, in cities such as San Francisco, the confined, dinghy apartments on offer are an indication of how property prices are skyrocketing in some metropolitan areas. The collection of budget homes is revealed as the National Realtors Association confirmed house sales across the country fell to a nine-month low in January. Bargain: The homes where you get more for your money includes a blue, wooden-fronted three-bedroom and one bathroom house in Richmond, Virginia, which costs just $109,000 . Cut-price: This three-bedroom bungalow on a tree-lined street in Waco, Texas, will set buyers back $110,000 . The homes where you get more for your money include a blue, wooden-fronted three-bedroom and one bathroom house in Richmond, Virginia. According to the real estate agent. the $109,000 house is nestled in the Historic Highland Park and comes with hardwood flooring, a family room and a spacious dining room. Another is a three-bedroom bungalow on a tree-lined street in Waco. Texas. The description says the property 'needs updating' but the space inside means there is room to experiment - all for just $110,000. However in San Francisco, first time buyers will have to fork out $127,000 for a dinghy studio apartment. It is described by Realtors.com as 'luxury city living at its best' and is aimed at first time buyers. There are little luxuries in the condo, but some of the lower level apartments boast outdoor patios. Similarly, a $109,000 studio in Harlem, New York City, boasts short walks to the nearest Subway stations and is listed as being 'small' but in 'good condition'. The property markets in both cities, along with Los Angeles, have become virtually unstoppable. A budget of $130,000 in the Big Apple may only be enough to purchase a sought-after parking space, let alone a house. In San Francisco, if prospective buyers want to purchase a home in the richest third, they will have to spend more than $860,410. Landscaped community: In Colorado Springs, Colorado, this two-bedroom, two-bathroom property is just just shy of $110,000 and even has a rear deck and garden . Even though many residents opt to rent apartments rather than buy family homes, landlords are raising rent by 12 per cent in San Francisco and 9 per cent in New York - which means many low-income buyers are priced out of both sides of the  market. For the same price of the tiny apartment in Harlem, prospective buyers can get their hands on a two-bedroom and two-bathroom suburban property in Colorado Springs in a 'beautifully landscaped setting'. It also boasts an rear deck overlooking a garden and ample parking to entertain visitors. It is listed at $109,900. For $125,000 there is also an adorable 4-bedroom, 2-bathroom bungalow in  Atlanta, Georgia, described by realtors as inviting and stylish. In Baton Rouge, Louisiana, $100,000 will land you a spacious two-bedroom and one-bathroom home where you can 'entertain guests' with ease. The description reads: 'Have an indoor soiree in the spacious living room or bring the fun outdoors to the private fenced backyard and covered patio.' A century-old, three- and 1.5-bath home in Louisville, Kentucky, costs only $120,000, while a three-bed, two-bath bungalow in Fort Wayne, Indiana - with enough room for a basketball hoop next to the garage will set buyers back just $115,000.

It was revealed on Monday that US existing-home sales slowed to their lowest pace in nine months in January, despite very low mortgage interest rates, the National Association of Realtors said Monday. Total sales of used homes fell 4.9 percent from December to an annual rate of 4.82 million units, with the fall in both the single-family unit category and in condominiums. Sales were 3.2 percent higher than a year earlier, but January 2014 was marked by a sharp downturn in economic activity when wide swaths of the eastern half of the country endured repeated severe winter storm. 'January housing data can be volatile because of seasonal influences,' said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist. 'But low housing supply and the ongoing rise in home prices above the pace of inflation appeared to slow sales despite interest rates remaining near historic lows.' Quaint: This two-bedroom and one-bath home in Fresno, California, is described as 'well-maintained' and is situated on a spacious lot . Great outdoors: This two-bedroom and one bath home in Spokane, Washington, is said to be well-suited to nature lovers, because of its proximity to the Centennial Trail and Spokane River . Total inventory of used houses for sale increased slightly in the month, and unsold inventory equalled a 4.7-month supply at the current sales pace. The median price for an existing home was $199,600, 6.2 percent more than in January 2014. Jennifer Lee of BMO Capital Markets called it 'clearly a disappointing report.' 'There were fewer sales of singles (-5.1 percent) and condos (-3.5 percent) although the former is still above levels a year ago.' The real estate brokerage Redfin recently reported that sales of properties costing more $1 million climbed 9 percent year-over-year, based on data from the July to October quarters. Overall sales slipped 1.2 percent. This three-bed, two-bath bungalow in Fort Wayne, Indiana - with enough room for a basketball hoop next to the garage will set buyers back just $115,000.

"Finding a parking space close to your destination in a busy city centre can often be a challenge, but car manufacturer Ford has a solution - by bringing parts of your car together to make a collapsible bicycle. The car giant has revealed designs for a collapsible bike that can be built by scavenging components from their vehicles. The design incorporates the car jack as pedals of the bike, makes use of the car's spare tyre as wheels and even turns a removable headrest into a bicycle seat. Ford's new design (above) shows how a collapsible bike can be put together using components from a car . The company hopes the bike could help make it easier for commuters and for motorists in towns and cities where parking can be difficult. On top of its car business, Ford has recently been branching out into the bike market. In 2011 it unveiled designs for an electric bike that was capable of travelling 50 miles on just one charge. The e-bike used hi-tech magnetic sensors from its F1 vehicles to produce a motor that responds in just 1/100th of a second. It also stored batteries inside the aluminum frame of the bike. A concept of the bike weighed just 5.5lb (2.5kg). In 2013 Ford teamed up with Pedego Electric Bikes to produce a new electric bike called the Supercruiser. The bike could also provide an emergency form of transport for if a car runs out of fuel - allowing the driver to ride to the closest petrol station to get more. Ford revealed its plans in a new patent application that has just been published. In it the company said: 'Mobility in urban areas becomes increasingly difficult with population growth since increasing the infrastructure to accommodate a larger population can be difficult. 'For example, adding roads or increasing the size of existing roads to accommodate more passenger vehicles in urban areas can be onerous. 'Even if more roads were added and existing roads expanded, commuters to urban areas may nevertheless encounter increased pollution and parking shortages.' The patent suggests that to combat this, future motor vehicles could contain components that have dual uses. Ford's patent envisages the bike will be incorporated into the body of its popular cars like the Focus above . The patent says the bike will collapse (as above) to make it easy to store when commuters reach the office . It suggests that a basic bike frame made from aluminum, titanium, carbon fibre or even bamboo could be incorporated into the body of a car. Ford proposes using a new type of spare wheel in the car that can be broken into two halves to provide the front and back wheels of the bike. The jack, stored in the boot of the vehicle, could also  be switched to pedals. One of these will contain cogs that will convert the pedaling action into forward motion. Removable headrests from inside the car could be made from gel or foam padding coated in nylon or carbon fibre to produce a comfortable bike seat. Headrests in the car made from gel or foam can be removed and attached to the bike frame to form a seat . The wheels of the bike (above) can be locked together to form a single spare car tyre according to the patent . The patent said: 'The bicycle includes components that can also be used in a vehicles such as a car, truck or sports utility vehicle. 'The rear wheel and the front wheel may be fixed to one another for use in a spare wheel in a vehicle or separated for use in the bicycle. 'The seat may be used as a headrest in the vehicle. The drive mechanism may be used as a jack to at least partially lift the vehicle during maintenance. 'Moreover, the frame may be collapsible so that it may be easily stored in the vehicle when the bicycle is not in use. 'Additionally, a collapsible frame may allow the rider to conveniently store the bicycle in an ultimate destination such as an office.' The patent was lodged by Ford Global Technologies - a subsidiary of the Ford Motor Group that handles its intellectual property. In 2013 Ford announced it had signed a deal with folding bicycle maker Dahon, raising the prospect that the two firm may be working together to develop new types of bikes. Ford did not respond when contacted to comment on the patent.","Car giant has designed a bicycle that can be stored in the body of a vehicle .

"A Boeing 747 which was transported in separate pieces along a motorway on Valentine's Day may have been on its way to a special forces training base where it will be used by elite soldiers to practise rescuing hostages from planes captured by terrorists. The large jet caused travel chaos earlier this month when it was driven by police escort from Cotswold Airport in Kemble, Gloucestershire, down the A419 dual carriageway between Cirencester and Swindon. At first the jumbo jet was believed to be on the way to a university studio for interior design students. But now it has emerged that it may have been travelling to a hidden underground bunker in Herefordshire to  be used for training by the Who Dares Wins regiment. A Boeing 747 seen being driven on the A419 between Cirencester and Swindon may have been on its way to a £10million hidden bunker for SAS training, where it may be used by soldiers to simulate hostage situations . An illustration shows how a Boeing 747 may be used in the bunker to simulate a real hostage attack on a jet . People living nearby claim to have seen the plane arriving and Helen Keighley, director of quality and business at the Nottingham academy which was the jet's original believed destination, said it had not arrived there. Last April it emerged that the bunker, beneath the Herefordshire base of the SAS, was to be used by the elite force for training. According to reports the £10million base is  large enough to contain jumbo jets so that soldiers can use them to practise how to deal with incidents where terrorists capture planes and hold dozens of hostages for ransom. The appearance of the plane has led to speculation that the bunker may be near completion, as the UK steps up surveillance and anti-terror patrols in the wake of recent attacks in Paris. Last week the plane was believed to be on the way to Nottingham but never arrived. Instead, the lorries carrying it had parked overnight at Whitchurch at Ross-on-Wye and the plane was seen being driven through Hereford the next day. Villagers living near the top secret bunker in Herefordshire told the Western Daily Press they saw an aircraft going into the remote Pontrilas Army Training Area - believed to be around 16 miles from the well equipped bunker. The state-of-the-art facility was previously said to be being built below ground to reduce the threat of an Al Qaeda attack and also to cut the noise currently caused by explosions and constant rifle fire during exercises. Because it is underground it is not able to be seen from the air or satellite surveillance. Last April it emerged the bunker will include firing ranges of 200 yards and special insulation to reduce the sound of bullets in the walls beneath the Herefordshire HQ that will make up the secret training base . The bunker is said to contain 'kill rooms' designed to mimic real situations the forces may find themselves in . It is also expected to contain kill rooms, designed to mimic the real buildings crack teams may one day have to fight in.The site has a 200 yard firing range and walls covered with rubber insulation to reduce the sound from gun fire and explosions. Previous reports have confirmed plans for a passenger jet to be used on the site. The plane is set to be used at least once a week by the counter-terrorist team, which is on permanent standby to respond to any threat to national security, including hijack situations. The bunker is said to be large enough to contain several of the aircraft, which measure 22 feet wide, 16ft 3ins high and is 137ft long. The Boeing 747 was transported by police escort on February 14 and caused long tailbacks on the roads . Despite being split into several parts the plane still took up two lanes of the motorway creating problems . People living near the SAS base claimed to have seen a Boeing 747 arriving at the Pontrillas site . On February 14 the Boeing 747 was cut into several pieces to be transported through Cirencester. The front section and cockpit of the Jumbo' was loaded onto a large lorry as it was driven along the M4. The abnormally large load took up two lanes of the motorway, causing long tailbacks. The Ministry of Defence declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline.  A spokesman said: 'The MOD do not discuss any matters pertaining to UK Special Forces.’ The Pontrilas site was revealed as an SAS training ground during the inquest of Royal Marine commando Lance Corporal Gordon Campbell in 2007. He died after he fell 100ft from a helicopter during an exercise to practise a night attack.","Boeing 747 was transported on the A419 between Cirencester and Swindon .

"The super-rich's dogs are often seen as a fashionable accessory to go along with shoes and handbags, but some pets are enjoying with an extravagant existence of their own that is unthinkable to the average person. The Rich Dogs of Instagram, a new photo account that draws inspiration from the opulence on the Rich Kids of Instagram, shows how having a dog's life isn't always a bad thing. It displays the wealthy's pampered pooches sunbathing in crystal clear pools, rolling around in wads of cash and flying on private jets. The dogs probably cannot revel in the jealousy of others the way their  masters can, though the canines do seem to be making the most of the high life.

Luxurious lapdogs: Kaylin Pound of Elite Daily brought together pictures of the world's luckiest dogs after seeing an account making fun of the Rich Kids of Instagram . The collection of canines with more money than Croesus was aggregated together by Elite Daily's Kaylin Pound starting Thursday after she saw a site mocking the original Rich Kids of Instagram. While the Rich Kids may coast through life using money from their parents, their pets don't even have to worry about paying for anything. Using the hashtag #rdoi, the account has posted 50 pictures with assorted wealthy dog jokes. Rich Instagram users' pooches are seen getting ready to do the 'doggy paddle' in indoor mansion pools. Another dog sat in a mini Audi Spyder says the new car is 'bad to the bone'. Better than a leash: While the lapdogs are sometimes considered an accessory, they get to wear designer clothing themselves .

Give paws: The dogs of the super-rich enjoy luxuries that most humans will never get the chance to experience . A picture of a pooch surrounded by the conquests of a luxury shopping trip is captioned 'throw it in the doggy bag'. The trust fund puppies probably do not know how good they have it, enjoying luxury vacations and in exotic locations beyond most hardworking humans' wildest dreams. However, several do a good job of looking smug for the camera, no doubt confident in the fact that they are the 'one percent' of the millions of dogs on the Internet. Doggies show off their style as their owners dress them up in extravagant designer clothes or add to the animals' natural fur with an expensive, fluffy coat.

Air Bud: Owners flying on their private jets take time out to photograph their pets soaring in luxury when they are not taking selfies themselves . The array of poodles, pugs and chihuahuas also seems particularly fond of high-class champagne, with bottles of brands such as Dom Perignon being poured into their mouths. Unfortunately, while their owners may pride themselves on distinguishing between the finest bubblies, alcohol can be severely toxic to dogs and make them sick. Two years ago there was also a Rich Cats of Instagram page, though the Tumblr page has stopped updating.

"Ukip MEPs were today accused of showing 'complete disregard' for road safety  after voting against new rules making it easier to track and punish reckless foreign motorists caught speeding  in the UK. At the moment, foreign drivers caught by a speed camera  cannot be fined because the police do not have the power to trace people abroad. But the European Parliament has backed new measures giving  forces the power to send fines and pursue foreign motorists back to their home countries. But Ukip's MEPs voted against the measure, because it also allows foreign police forces to track British motorists caught speeding abroad. Motorists caught by speed cameras abroad face being tracked down and forced to pay a fine, under new EU rules . A Labour source said Ukip was showing 'complete disregard' for road safety in the UK. Shadow Transport Secretary Michael Dugher added: 'These new laws will make it easier to catch foreign drivers who commit offences within the UK. 'They will ensure that drivers in foreign-registered vehicles will no longer be able to just flout laws on serious driving offences without facing the consequences. It is right that the UK authorities will be able to get the tools they need to identify offenders. 'Why does UKIP want to let foreigners driving in Britain off the hook?' Motorists can already be traced abroad if they are driving hire cars or given on-the-spot fines. But the new rules will allow motorists to be fined for speeding, ignoring a red light, drink and drug driving and driving while using a mobile phone. If a driver commits an offence in another country, the police will be able to use their car's registration number to track them down. They will be given the power to send out a letter in the driver's own language, demanding payment and threatening court action if they do not pay the fine. Labour's shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher has slammed Nigel Farage over Ukip's failure to back new rules making it easier to catch foreign motorists flouting the law in the UK . It means British police will be able to pursue foreign motorists driving in Britain for any traffic and speeding fines they have accumulated in the UK. The Bill will apply to member states from May – but the UK will have two years to enforce the new law. The move, which is backed by ministers, has been welcomed by road safety campaigners. Ed Morrow, from the organisation Brake, said: 'For a driver who puts lives at risk to escape prosecution because their vehicle is registered in another country is both insulting and incomprehensible for victims. Illegal driving crosses borders, so enforcement must cross borders too.' The Department for Transport added: 'It's not right that foreign drivers have gone unpunished for speeding offences in the UK, and we are pleased this is set to change. 'But it mustn't be easier for British drivers to be prosecuted abroad than for foreign drivers to be prosecuted in the UK. We have made this clear from the outset of the negotiations.' But, Ukip transport spokeswoman Jill Seymour said: 'Typically the Tory government say they will oppose it in London while Tory MEPs vote for it in Brussels. 'Ukip are completely united in their will that only British authorities have access to the data about British drivers. The EU harmonisation of legislation means the centralisation of power in Brussels. The LibLabCon may consent to this but UKIP never will. 'This report relates to speeding offences; the idea is to be able to transfer licence points across Member States. Not all Member States are the same; this could lead to unfair cases of people being banned from driving. 'LibLabCon meps are happy for you to lose your license....Just ask them about it in May. '","Currently, drivers caught by speed cameras  abroad cannot be traced .

"SeaWorld Orlando has ended public dolphin feedings at its park and will now charge visitors to spend short amounts of time with the sea creatures. Guests at the Florida location will still be able to pet the dolphins, but they will no longer be able to buy $7 trays of fish to lure the mammals over to the side of their enclosure. They will be able to pay $15 to spend 10 minutes with the clever animals in ten-person groups and get their pictures next to the dolphins with the help of a trainer. SeaWorld Orlando is eliminating its public dolphin feeding program, where visitors could pay $7 to lure the animals with a tray of food (file photo) SeaWorld said that the program resembles those at its San Diego and San Antonio parks, according to the Orlando Sentinel. The change will likely help the stomachs of dolphins who eat unnatural material dropped in their tanks by visitors, said Mark Palmer, associate director for the International Marine Mammal Project. More distance between children and the animals will also help prevent bitings, such as the attack on Jillian Thomas, who was holding a tray of food, in 2012. The then-eight-year-old Georgia girl suffered from three puncture wounds and her father, who captured the incident on video, said that she could have been pulled into the water. Jillian Thomas, then eight, was bitten by a dolphin at the Orlando park and suffered puncture wounds in 2012 . Some animal rights activists have urged against humans having any ability to touch the dolphins, saying that it is also dangerous for the cetaceans. A nine-year-old's hand was bitten in 2014 at the park's location in Texas. after the Blackfish documentary look at aggressive behavior in one of the chain's orcas who was involved in three deaths. The park has had a run of bad publicity ever since Blackfish, a documentary that looked at aggressive behavior in one of the chain's orcas who was involved in three deaths. CEO Jim Atchinson resigned at the end of last year amid slumping profits. Nanuq, a 32-year-old Beluga whale who was on loan from Canada, died in Orlando last week from a fractured jaw. Nanuq the 32-year-old Beluga whale (pictured with actress Isla Fisher in 2013) died after receiving a jaw injury . He reportedly had an 'interaction' with two other whales at the park and got an infection from his injury. Most of the creatures at the Florida attraction's Dolphin Cove are friendly, and come up to play with visitors while making small splashes. Some guests said they were more interested in petting the dolphins than giving them their supper. The San Antonio and San Diego parks charge $50 and $60 per person respectively for small group dolphin feeding experiences. The Orlando park's dolphin area is not currently open and will resume operations on March 2, according to News13. While dolphins are known for their playful behavior and permanently painted smiles, they are also known for their sheer physical power and sharp teeth which have led to attacks on humans. Human feeding is linked behind many reported attacks though other incidents have been seen during moments of sexual aggression. Federal officials say dolphins are of little threat to people in captive swim programs - in 1994 less than 1 out of 10,000 people injured - but those animals in the wild are far more spontaneous and unpredictable in their behavior. In Louisiana a single wild dolphin was reported terrorizing residents in a waterside community in Slidell where it bit three people in June 2012. In one incident a boater's hand was sliced open by the dolphin's teeth while he stuck his hand in the water to clean it. In another case a girl was dragged into the water by her ankle. Other reports described the dolphin as head butting and chasing acquaintances. Like many other incidents, officials in Louisiana said there were related reports of people feeding the dolphin and attempting to lure it out with food potentially leading to its association of all humans having food.","Guests used to be able to buy $7 tray of fish food at Dolphin Cove .

"Republican Congressman Aaron Schock, whose taste in lavish Downton Abbey-inspired office furnishings has sparked an ethics inquiry - along with many a late-night joke - is now under scrutiny for spending tens of thousands of dollars in taxpayer and campaign funds on flights aboard private planes. There also have been other expensive travel and entertainment charges, including for a massage company and shows, among them a sold-out Katy Perry concert in Washington DC. The expenses highlight the relationships that lawmakers sometimes have with donors who fund their political ambitions, an unwelcome message for a congressman billed as a fresh face of the GOP. The Associated Press identified at least a dozen flights worth more than $40,000 on aircraft belonging to Schock's donors since mid-2011. High-flying lawmaker: Republican Congressman Aaron Schock, whose taste in lavish Downton Abbey-inspired office furnishings has sparked an ethics inquiry, also reportedly spent taxpayer and campaign funds on private airplanes to fly him around the country on aircraft owned by some of his key donors . Seeing red: Photos taken in January of Schock's new office in the Rayburn Office Building, which was designed to resemble the dining room of the PBS show Downton Abbey . What would the dowager countess say? Schock's penchant for over-the-top office decor inspired by the hit show set in a grand English manor house has made him the butt of many a late-night joke . The AP tracked Schock's reliance on the planes partly through the congressman's penchant for uploading pictures and videos of himself to his Instagram account. The AP extracted location data associated with each image then correlated it with flight records showing airport stopovers and expenses later billed for air travel against Schock's office and campaign records. Asked for comment, Schock responded in an email Monday that he travels frequently throughout his Peoria-area district 'to stay connected with my constituents' and also travels to raise money for his campaign committee and congressional colleagues. He said he takes compliance with congressional funding rules seriously and has begun a review of his office's procedures 'concerning this issue and others to determine whether they can be improved.' Donors who owned planes on which travel was paid for by Schock's House and political accounts did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment Monday. Schock's high-flying lifestyle, combined with questions about expenses decorating his office in the refined style of the hit TV show Downton Abbey, add to awkward perceptions on top of allegations he illegally solicited donations in 2012. The Office of Congressional Ethics said in a 2013 report that there was reason to believe Schock violated House rules by soliciting campaign contributions for a committee that backed Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a Republican from Illinois, in a 2012 primary. The House Ethics Committee has said that query remains open. Statement piece: The interior decorator responsible for the GOP congressman's crimson study owns a company called Euro Trash LLC . Shaking it off: Haters are gonna hate,' Schock, 33, told ABC News after the 'Downton Abbey' office decor story broke in The Washington Post . While the decorations in Rep. Schock's office have drawn comparisons to 'Downton Abbey,' the politician has said he's never seen the show . 'Haters are gonna hate,' Schock, 33, told ABC News after the 'Downton Abbey' office decor story broke in The Washington Post, brushing off the controversy by invoking a line from one of pop singer Taylor Swift's songs. Lawmakers can use office funds for private flights as long as payments cover their share of the costs. But most of the flights Schock covered with office funds occurred before the House changed its rules in January 2013. The earlier rules prohibited lawmakers from using those accounts to pay for flights on private aircraft, allowing payments only for federally licensed charter and commercial flights. Schock's House account paid more than $24,000 directly to a Peoria aviation firm for eight flights provided by one of Schock's donor's planes in 2011 and 2012. While the aircraft flies as part of an Illinois charter service, the owner of the service told the AP on Monday that any payments made directly to the donor's aviation company would not have been for charter flights. Beyond air travel, Schock spent thousands more on tickets for concerts, car mileage reimbursements — among the highest in Congress — and took his interns to a sold-out Katy Perry concert in Washington last June. The donor planes include an Italian-made Piaggio twin-engine turboprop owned by Todd Green of Springfield, Illinois, who runs car dealerships in Schock's district with his brother, Jeff. Todd Green told a Springfield newspaper that Jeff — a pilot and campaign contributor — and Schock have been friends for a long time. Best boss: Schock took his interns to a sold-out Katy Perry concert in Washington last June (pictured) Good times: 'You can't say no when your boss invites you. Danced my butt off,' one former intern posted on his Instagram account with a picture of Perry during her This Prismatic World Tour . The AP found that Green's plane traveled to at least eight cities last October in the Midwest and East Coast, cities where Schock met with political candidates ahead of the midterm elections. His Instagram account's location data and information from the service FlightAware even pinpointed Schock's location on a stretch of road near one airport before Green's plane departed. Campaign records show a $12,560 expense later that month to Jeff Green from a political action committee associated with Schock, called the GOP Generation Y Fund. That same month, the PAC paid $1,440 to massage parlor for a fundraising event. In November 2013, Schock cast votes in the Capitol just after Green's plane landed at nearby Reagan National Airport. Shortly after Green's return to Peoria, Schock posted a photo from his 'Schocktoberfest' fundraising event at a brewery in his district. Schock billed his office account $11,433 for commercial transportation during that same, four-day period to a Peoria flight company, Byerly Aviation. The AP's review covered Schock's travel and entertainment expenses in his taxpayer-funded House account, in his campaign committee and the GOP Generation Y Fund. Records show more than $1.5million in contributions to the Generation Y Fund since he took office in 2009. Schock used House office expenses to pay more than $24,000 for eight flights between May 2011 and December 2012 on a six-passenger Cessna Golden Eagle owned by D&B Jet Inc., run by Peoria agribusiness consultant and major Schock donor Darren Frye. While D&B is a private corporate aviation firm, it also flies with Jet Air Inc., an Illinois-based aviation firm licensed by the FAA for charter service. He does get around! The AP investigation has revealed that Schock, pictured here in Vatican with Pope Francis last month, took at least a dozen flights worth more than $40,000 on aircraft belonging to some of his donors since mid-2011 . Familiar faces: The 33-year-old up-and-coming GOP lawmaker spent thousands more on tickets for concerts. Schock is pictured left posing with pop star Ariana Grande in LA, and right with Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler at the Country Music Awards in Nashville . Records show Schock used House funds to directly pay D&B instead of Jet Air for the eight flights. Under the old rules that previously allowed House funds to pay only for charter or commercial aircraft, Schock's office would likely not have been authorized to pay for private flights unless the House Ethics Committee approved it. Harrel W. Timmons, Jet Air's owner, said in a telephone interview that any charter flights D&B flies through his firm are paid directly to Jet Air. 'They've got their own corporate jet and pilot,' he said. House records also show that, since 2013, Schock has flown four times on a Cessna owned by Peoria auto dealer Michael J. Miller and businessman Matthew Vonachen, who heads a janitorial firm, Vonachen Services Inc. Schock's House office account paid nearly $6,000 total for the four flights, according to federal data published online by the nonprofit Sunlight Foundation. Surf's up! The buff, globe-trotting politician stated that he travels frequently throughout his district 'to stay connected with my constituents' and also travels to raise money for his campaign committee . Under current House rules, the payments for the private flights would be authorized if they paid for Schock's portion of each flight. It is not clear from records how many other passengers flew on the same flights. Vonachen and his family donated at least $27,000 to Schock's campaigns, while Miller contributed $10,000 to the Automotive Free International Trade PAC. Schock has supported recent free trade agreements with South Korea and with several other countries, which the Automotive PAC — a Schock contributor — lauded. Schock's reliance on donor-owned planes and on his government allowance to pay for the flights mirrors the use by Sen. Robert Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, of a private jet owned by a wealthy eye doctor and major donor. Prompted by an ethics investigation, Menendez reimbursed donor Salomon Melgen $58,500 for two flights. GOP Generation Y paid more than $24,000 for tickets and festivals, including $13,000 to country music events, $4,700 in expenses to Chicago ticket broker SitClose.com, and $3,000 for a 'fundraising event' to an organization that runs the Global Citizen Festival in New York. 'You can't say no when your boss invites you. Danced my butt off,' one former intern posted on his Instagram account with a picture of Perry at her June 2014 show. PAC records show a $1,928 expense for the ticket service StubHub.com two months later, listing it only as a 'PAC fundraising event.' Records show Schock also requested more than $18,000 in mileage reimbursements since 2013, among the highest in Congress. His office has previously said it was reviewing those expenses.","Congressman Schock, a Republican from Illinois, reportedly took at least a dozen flights worth more than $40,000 in donors' planes since 2011 .

"Disgraced: Florida osteopath Dr Daniel McBath has died of a heart attack two months after he was banned from treating female patients in light of allegations of sexual abuse and professional misconduct . A Florida doctor accused of repeatedly drugging at least three female patients with cocaine and sedatives and sexually assaulting them, has died while vacationing in Tennessee, his family said. Dr Daniel McBath, an osteopath from Dade City had his license restricted by the state in December for 'egregious and predatory' behavior involving three women. McBath, 53, who was forced to close his practice following the allegations, died from a heart attack in the early hours of Monday morning. Don McBath said his brother had been determined to fight 'clear his name' but said that the allegations 'were too much.' 'There's not a person on this earth who could handle the pressure he was faced with. He was never arrested, never any hearings. It was nothing but allegations, and it weighed on him. he told the Pasco Tribune. Don McBath said that several of his brother's former friends 'ostracized' him after news broke about the allegations, which were investigated by the Dade City Police Department and Florida Department of Law Enforcement. 'These allegations have existed, some of them for a long time, and no arrests were ever made,' Don McBath said. 'I wonder why? Probably because there's no evidence. It was sad to see people he thought were his friends turn their back on him. 'He was totally distraught over this stuff. And it all boiled down to money — people wanting settlements and stuff like that.' McBath is survived by his wife, two daughters and a son. The physician allegedly assaulted some of the victims at his McBath Medical Center at 23933 17th Street in Dade City . Under an emergency order issued by the Department of Health, McBath was prevented from treating female patients at his McBath Medical Center at 23933 17th Street in Dade City in December. According to the 34-page order signed by State Surgeon General John Armstrong and cited by WPTV, McBath repeatedly drugged and sexually assaulted a patient with a history of abuse between June 2009 and January 2014. The doctor diagnosed the victim with obesity, even though at the time the 5-foot-7 woman a weighed only 135lbs. He later diagnosed the woman with hormonal imbalance, chronic pain, anxiety and fatigue 'without any supporting medical justification,' the order states, and prescribed her a cocktail of Adderall, Xanax, hydrocodone and B-12 shots. On at least one occasion, McBath allegedly injected a white liquid into the patient's vagina, telling her it would give her a stronger sex drive. In the course of her treatment, the 35-year-old woman came to McBath's house and he instructed her to put on his wife's clothes, which she refused to do. Family man: McBath is survived by his wife, Brenda (left), and his son and two daughters . The doctor and patient drank alcohol and used cocaine. The order states the woman then passed out and later woke up in McBath's bed. With the woman slipping in and out of consciousness, McBath injected her with an unknown substance in her vagina and then proceeded to have sex with her, along with another man who was at the house, the document claims. Identified only as Mr DH' in the order, the man allegedly had vaginal, oral and anal sex with the woman. McBath later also penetrated her with his hand, causing her to bleed profusely. On another occasion, McBath allegedly asked the patient to rub her privates with a cigar. Months later, the doctor took a photo of the woman's vagina without her consent, the order states. In July 2004, McBath's then-26-year-old intern reported an incident during which the married doctor came over to her house to teach her how to perform a varicose vain removal procedure. Betrayal of trust: McBath, pictured left and right with his wife, was accused of drugging a 26-year-old intern and exposing himself to her before she lost consciousnesses. He later said they had 'made love' Both of them drank beer and McBath gave the intern two blue pills telling her it was an antibiotic. The medicine made the woman feel woozy, which McBath claimed was a reaction to the antibiotic. While McBath was performing a 'chiropractic manipulation' on his employee, the order states he rolled her on her back, took her face in his hands and told her he had 'wanted to do this since the second day of work.' The well-respected doctor then started kissing her on her mouth and breasts despite her protestations, according to the order, before exposing his erect penis and asking her if she 'wanted some of this.' The intern then lost consciousness. She came to on McBath's couch sometime later and was told by the doctor that they had 'made love,' the order states. The 26-year-old found her neck to be covered in 'love bites' and later tested positive for a sedative. 'Egregious': The doctor allegedly drugged and sexually assaulted a 35-year-old woman with a history of abuse between June 2009 and January 2014 after misdiagnosing her with obesity . The most recent incident involving Dr McBath dates to April of last year when he allegedly gave his long-time patient a shot for a suspected urinary tract infection, which caused her to pass out. The 32-year-old woman, who has been McBath's patient since age 14, woke up on his couch four hours later. She too tested positive for the same sedative as the intern. When the patient reported the incident to police, detectives had her call McBath to talk to him about what happened between them, with officers listening in on their conversation. McBath allegedly told the woman that they did not have sex and instructed her not to talk about this to anyone. McBath, who has a wife and two grown children, has not been charged with any crime pending an investigation by the local sheriff's department. When contacted by Tampa Bay Times for a comment on the allegations, the doctor has denied the patients' claims, calling them 'pathetic' and saying they were the result of retaliation, but he would not say for what. 'Dr. McBath demonstrated predatory behavior,' the emergency order in the case concludes. 'The number of patients that have reported the sexual misconduct and administration of substances without consent indicates that Dr. McBath's conduct will continue.'","Osteopath Dr Daniel McBath died of a heart attack in his sleep on Monday .

"They are not like any burgers you've ever seen and you certainly won't find these bizarre buns at your local McDonald’s or Burger King. The crazy creations are the brainchild of  artists Thomas Weil and Quentin Weisbuch, who were so bored of ubiquitous lunchtime sandwiches that they took matters into their own hands. The duo soon established a ritual where they conducted weekly experiments on new ways of cooking burgers during their very short lunch break with the ultimate aim being to design an edible masterpiece of ‘everything that tastes good between two buns.’ The Beerger bun is made with malt, barley and hops. The patty  comes with onions, slices of orange, cabbage and cheese . The Mystery Box burger (left), created for Master Chef USA is composed of raw salmon, smoked bacon, mint, basil, garlic and yogurt sauce, rice cake, rice bun, black sesame seeds, salmon roe, mint and basil leaves and balsamic cream. The oyster burger (right) is made with sea rye bread, 'tsunami' butter, shallots, oysters, lemon drizzle, dill 'spray' and 'wrecked' wakame . Their wondrous creations, which feature everything from a gold-leaf covered burger and rolls stuffed with raw oysters, to 'burger' composed of rice and sushi, are featured on the duo's website Fat & Furious Burger. Thomas and Quentin – who founded the graphic design and art studio Furious – used the recipes to launch their Fat and Furious Burger cookbook late last year, with 60 recipes for ‘kamikaze livers and intrepid stomachs.’ The blurb on their website reads: ‘As we were so bored of random food at lunch, we started cooking together. It soon became kind of a ritual: improvising and experimenting new ways of cooking a burger in very short lunch break. ‘It’s about an hour and a half to find an idea, run to a supermarket to get everything, cook, shoot and eat. ‘We didn’t expect this project to go viral: Back in 2012, we decided to launch our blog to show our crazy pics to our friend… never expecting it would be such a buzz!’ Crabzilla has spider crab, mango slices, curly lettuce, tomatoes, shrimp, lemon, fennel and chili mayonnaise . The Pizza Mutant Ninja Burger has tomatoes, bacon, lettuce, Cheddar, pepperoni, beef patty, mozzarella and salad . The bun in the Ocean Burger was painted with food colouring to make it appear like salmon skin. The burger has smoked salmon, cream cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, onions and mustard . The pair go on to explain that their project was born from the collision of two strong appetites. And while the burgers are not on any restaurant menu, the colleagues often work with chefs to come up with new creations. The added: ‘We  cook them [the burgers] for our daily meals, so it’s all about one shot, but we often collaborate with restaurants to create special burgers people can actually taste.’ The Paris-based pair say it costs anything from 5 to 50 Euros to make their burgers. Happy Birthger (left) is rare beef with fondant, coulis of red wine and dark chocolate, red onion compote, slivered almonds poire belle Helene (poached pears in sugar syrup) and fresh goat's cheese. Tell Dad Burger (right) has layers of ham, carrots, peas, and pureed vegetables .

When the twosome first started on their project they were shooting on their iPhones. They have since graduated to their own studio with a proper kitchen and professional camera equipment. Understandably, with so many strange ingredients, the burgers are '‘sometimes a great surprise and sometimes kind of a fail.'

The Hobbit Burger is made from a single bagel stuffed with  'Mordor' powder, peppers, onion rings, cod roe, hummus, cucumber and dill . One of the pair's favourite burgers is the Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Burger that they created in collaboration with a restaurant in Geneva called Le Calamar. They said: 'We were very excited to work on a global Burger event that included the creation of a delirium burger recipe. '[It included] the creation of crazy posters and designs for the event’s communication, and above all creating a new food tasting experience.' But their sushi-shaped burger has so far proved to be the most popular. They said: ‘The sushi shaped burger we created in collaboration with tumblr & Master chef USA has been really appreciated by our community. [There were] more than 1500 reblogs on tumblr and thousands of likes on Instagram and Facebook.' It came from space: The UFO Burger with flying fish roe, tobiko wasabi, breaded chicken fillet, wakame salad, grilled papadum, beetroot sauce and slices of ginger and lemon .

"Three 'utterly depraved' paedophiles - a married couple and another woman - have been jailed for a total of 14-and-a-half years after plotting to inflict horrific sexual abuse on children. Kevin and Susan Barnett, along with Nikita Moore, were convicted of sharing plans to rape and sexually assault young children in June 2014, via online messaging service WhatsApp, after a two-and-a-half week trial in December. Both women - the ex-wife and lover - moved in together after Barnett left them for another woman and they both went along with his paedophilic desires in a bid to win him back, a court heard. Kevin Barnett (left), his wife Susan (centre) and his girlfriend Nikita Moore (right), were convicted of sharing plans to rape and sexually assault young children in June 2014, . Barnett, aged 28, of Barrow, Cumbria, received a six-year prison sentence for one count of arranging or facilitating the commission of a child sexual offence, jointly with his wife Susan, 28, and two counts of conspiracy to commit a child sexual offence, jointly with 22-year-old co-defendant Nikita Moore. The two female defendants, who were living together, sobbed in court as Susan was handed a four-and-a-half year sentence and Moore a four year sentence. Judge Christopher Cornwall, passing sentence at Preston Crown Court today, described how extreme sexual exchanges between Barnett and the two women descended into plans to abuse children. He said: 'By this time you had all sunk so low and your thinking was so distorted that all basic, fundamental morality protecting children from adult sexual provision was simply absent.' Susan  was told it was to her 'eternal shame' that she did not react with 'outrage' to her husband's twisted suggestions. Moore, who began an affair with Barnett following the funeral of her partner in October 2013, shared 'violent sexual fantasies' with him involving giving birth to a child for them to abuse together. She also shared indecent photos of children, and spoke of her desire to see him rape a young child. Judge Cornwall said: 'The offences were committed in quite extraordinary circumstances in which two women were so desperate to rekindle their relationships with Kevin Barnett, that they were prepared to indulge his every terrible whim. 'The content of the messages was truly horrific and utterly depraved.' Kevin and Susan Barnett (pictured at their wedding in June 2013) had split up but were continuing to see each other when they discussed possible sexual abuse . Judge Cornwall accepted that other than indecent images being shared, there was no evidence that any other physical abuse was enacted on children by the three defendants. Barnett was described as a 'baneful influence' on the two women, and was said to have 'little understanding' of the harm he had caused. Sentencing Susan, Judge Cornwall said: 'You have a heavy burden to carry which you will be judged on for some considerable time to come.' Regard was given to mental health issues suffered by Moore, stemming from the loss of her baby two hours after its birth when she was 14 years old. The court heard she met Barnett at an 'extremely low ebb.' The trio were arrested after an 18-year-old woman, who was in a relationship with Kevin Barnett, tipped police off about messages she had read on his phone. Kevin Barnett (pictured) was at the centre of a love triangle in which his wife and girlfriend were prepared to indulge his sick fantasies in order to win him back . As well as the conspiracy and facilitation offences, Barnett and Moore were sentenced to six months, running concurrently with their other prison sentences, for possession of indecent images of children. The Barnett's each received six month concurrent sentences for possession of extreme pornographic images involving sexual activity with dogs and horses. All three defendants were banned from working with children and ordered to sign the sex offender's register indefinitely. They also received a Sexual Offences Prevention Order placing severe restrictions on any future use of the internet, computers or devices capable of digitally storing images. The conspiracy emerged by chance in June when Barnett found himself arrested over a domestic disturbance at a third woman's address. At that time he was said to be in a relationship with his wife Susan and Moore, both living at the marital address. The court heard the Barnetts had married in June 2013, but then separated early this year. Prosecutor Charles Brown said that in the course of graphic text message conversations with each other, the Barnetts had made arrangements and had discussed possible sexual abuse by  Barnett, with her indicating she would assist in the commission of those acts. Mr Brown said there were messages of a sexual nature between those two defendants which progressed to discussing sexual abuse. Mr Brown added: 'The conversations with Susan Barnett were taking place at the same time and often almost simultaneously with text conversations between Kevin Barnett and Nikita Moore.' Matters progressed with the two women seeking a relationship with the male defendant. The court was told before separating from his wife, Barnett had had a sexual relationship with Moore for three months. Barnett and Moore agreed together to engage in sexual activity with children. It was an escalating course of conduct between those two defendants, during which in text messages he requested her to perform a variety of sexual acts. Mr Brown said: 'In further mobile text messages they agreed and discussed in detail abusing children. The inference is Nikita Moore had been prepared to carry out his ever extreme sexual requests. The messages planning these sexual acts with children represented a genuine plan of action.' Nikita Moore, who was Barnett's girlfriend, told him she had had thoughts about sexually abusing a child . The night before his arrest, Barnett had had a sexual liaison with his wife and Moore. In June this year, he was at the home of the third woman, but was texting his wife and Moore. Police were called to a domestic disturbance and Barnett was arrested, initially to prevent a breach of the peace. She indicated he was no longer welcome at her home and drew police attention to text messages she had seen on his mobile phone. She had been suspicious he intended resuming a relationship with his wife. Mr Brown added: 'They saw the conversations in which Susan Barnett had agreed to facilitate and assist in sexual activity with a child.' Her phone was then seized, as well as that of Moore. All the phones were analysed. Some discussions were found that had taken place between Moore and Barnett. Mr Brown added: 'They discussed how they could gain access to children.' Barnett suggested she could get a job in child care. Moore disclosed to him she had had thoughts of sexually abusing a child, which he encouraged. 'It's a highly sexualised world in which he appears to live. He is lost in a world of unusual sexual practices where nothing appears to be ruled out.' Mr Brown said Susan and Moore were 'besotted' with Barnett and willing to assist him. Acting Detective Inspector Brian Murray, of the South Cumbria Public Protection Unit, said: 'I am pleased that justice has been served today and these three individuals will be facing prison for their crimes. 'Thankfully cases like this are extremely rare in Cumbria and the quick arrests of these three people once information came to light show that we are committed to protecting children in Cumbria.' After the case, prosecutor Charles Brown said: 'Susan Barnett, Kevin Barnett and Nikita Moore have been found guilty of extremely alarming offences whereby they planned amongst themselves the sexual abuse of vulnerable young children. 'They sent shockingly explicit messages to each other, including photographs of the children they planned to abuse, over a prolonged period of ten days. The messages shown during the trial proved that the abuse was intended to be made real and would have been put into action once the opportunity arose. 'All three defendants denied they intended to carry out the abuse they had discussed and attempted to explain it away as general talk about sexual fantasies. However, after carefully considering all the evidence against them, the jury has today found them guilty of all the repugnant offences they faced. 'The CPS and Police are dedicated to protecting children and young people, and will continue to do all in our power to bring to justice all those who harm them or plan to harm them in any way.'","Kevin Barnett, his wife and his girlfriend jailed for 'repugnant' abuse plans .

Wesselmann is well-known for his signature steel drawings, which he sketched between the 1980s and 1990s. According to her website, Princess Michael is a staunch art fan.

The 70-year-old looked engrossed in the work she was admiring inside Galerie Gmurzynska . The couple wed just a month after Princess Michael annulled her first marriage and now occupy an unusual place in the Royal family. Princess Michael of Kent is seen skiing in St Moritz, Switzerland . Because Prince Michael was the third-born child of George V's son the Duke of Kent, after siblings Prince Edward and Princess Alexandra, he and his wife do not receive a public allowance. A qualified Russian interpreter, he earns his money from a private consultancy firm offering international advice in construction, telecommunications, insurance, finance and tourism. But he and his wife have lived since 1978 in a five-bedroom apartment in Kensington Palace in the heart of London, where until 2010 the £120,000-a-year rent was paid for by the Queen. The revelation sparked calls to evict the couple - but Buckingham Palace defended the set-up in 2005, saying it was to recognise engagements they undertook at their own expense. Just five years later, however, Prince and Princess Michael began paying the full cost of the apartment themselves. Princess Michael's title with her husband's name is in fact completely normal for the Royal family - but she happens to be the only living member who is addressed in that way. It is because she is not a Princess in her own right and because, as Buckingham Palace puts it, 'Prince Michael is the only grandson of a king titled HRH who is a second son'.

"The government is looking at ways to counter Islamic State propaganda after it was revealed terrorists are serving up pancake recipes online to win over new followers. A national security review report has revealed terror groups such as Islamic State are using 'highly targeted messages to appeal to vulnerable audiences'. The report gives the example of IS releasing a pancake recipe 'designed to feed jihadists after a hard day of fighting'. A rough translation of the recipe website says the pancakes are quickly and easily prepared and best eaten with honey. 'Can supply to mujahideen (fighters) before scurrying out onto the fighting fronts and extend the mujahideen energy and power, God willing. 'Serve them to heroes.' Australian jihadi Mohamed Elomar is just one of many who has been accused of trying to recruit Australians to join Islamic State . ISIS fighters holding the Al-Qaeda flag with 'Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant' written on it in Aleppo, Syria . Prime Minister Tony Abbott detailed the terror groups' ploys on Monday during a landmark national security address. IS has also released a guidebook to help young mothers raise a 'Mujahid child'. 'Don't wait until they are seven to start, for it may be too late by then,' it says. The federal government is looking at ways to counter such propaganda, in consultation with Islamic communities. Islamic State first issued the pancake recipes in 2014 along with a recipe for balls of date mush. They instructed the pancakes should be made with egg, sugar, oil, salt, milk and flour. Militants are told that the date balls are best eaten during an 'intermission in battle' with coffee or water. 'They contain significant calories, and will extend the power and strength of the Mujahideen, God willing,' the post says. Ingredients: four tablespoons of flour, one egg, teaspoon of salt and a cup of milk . The recipe instructs cooks to put all the ingredients in a bowl and stir them well . Cooks are then told to pour a little oil into the pan and warm to a medium hear, before pouring in the pancake mixture. When the pancake starts bubbling it should be flipped over . Once brown on both sides the pancake is ready to be served. Militants suggest dishing it up with maple syrup or honey . The cookbook was published by the Zora Foundation, an arm of ISIS that is seeking to recruit women to the cause, and give advice to those already in Syria and Iraq. Their slogan is 'preparing for the honour of jihad' and their online accounts - which post only in Arabic - have attracted thousands of followers so far. ISIS strictly forbid women from taking part in combat, and so the propaganda films instead focus on how to assist jihad through 'feminine manual labour'. Among the suitable tasks given to women is producing and editing slideshows and film footage, in an effort to make more propaganda, and participating in 'jihadi science' - which is not explained further. Prime Minister Tony Abbott addresses the media during a national security statement at the AFP headquarters in Canberra, Monday, Feb. 23, 2015 . It is not known exactly how many women have joined ISIS, but it is common for men signing up to take their wives to fight alongside them. There are two all-female brigades operating in the de-facto capital of Raqqa, in Syria, including al-Khanssaa, which is thought to be lead by Aqsa Mahmood, 20, a British female jihadi. The brigade, whose job is to patrol the streets of Raqqa enforcing strict Sharia law, is thought to include up to sixty female radicals from the UK. The ingredients needed for power and strength increasing 'date balls' include dates, butter and flour . Terrorist wives  are told to take the pips out of the dates and melt the butter . Take the remains of the dates and add the butter.  Then combine with the flour . Cooks then need to role the mixture into the tiny balls before they are ready for their fighter husbands . On Monday, the PM announced many Australians who fight for the Islamic State will be stripped of their citizenship. The dramatic pledge came as a review released today revealed more than thirty Australians have returned home after fighting for jihadist causes overseas. The government is also exploring taking away some of the rights of jihadists who are sole Australian citizens, Mr Abbott said. That could include restricting their access to welfare payments, to consular help and their ability to leave or return to Australia. 'The Islam-ist death-cult has declared war on the world,' Mr Abbott said. 'We cannot allow bad people to use our good nature against us.' He added that Sydney siege gunman Man Monis had been given the benefit of the doubt too many times, including with citizenship. Mr Abbott also confirmed that ASIO is currently investigating thousands of terror leads and suspects, with 400 people deemed high risk. 'That's more than double the number a year ago,' Mr Abbott told the assembled crowd, which included top national security officers from the Australian Federal Police.

"The Fifty Shades Of Grey franchise has been dealt a major blow following claims that leading man Jamie Dornan will not be reprising his role as Christian Grey. The Northern Irish actor was expected to return as the enigmatic corporate executive in Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed, parts two and three in the hugely successful trilogy by British novelist E.L James. But according to Australian magazine NW Jamie, 32, has reportedly walked away from the plum role because wife of two-years Amelia Warner is uncomfortable with the raunchy sex scenes he shares with co-star Dakota Johnson. However, a representative for the screen star has said in a statement to MailOnline: 'All press reports are pure conjecture as the studio has not committed to a sequel as yet.' Scroll down for video . Fade to Grey: Australian magazine NW claim that Jamie Dornan will not be reprising his plum role in the 50 Shades Of Grey franchise because wife of two-years Amelia Warner is uncomfortable with the sex scenes . Uncomfortable: Dornan, pictured with Amelia at the GQ Men Of The Year awards in September, recently said she 'hasn't seen the film and I don't think she will, to be honest, I'd understand if she didn't want to.' Jamie recently spoke of his wife’s discomfort in an interview with the Evening Standard. He told the publication: ‘(Amelia) hasn’t seen the film and I don’t think she will, to be honest, I’d understand if she didn’t want to.’ And in a recent interview with Glamour magazine, his co-star Dakota also admitted that she didn't feel comfortable about her family watching the film. She said: 'I don't want my family to see [the movie], because it's inappropriate. Or my brothers' friends, who I grew up with. I think they'd be like, ""Blegh."" Also there's part of me that's like, I don't want anyone to see this movie. Just kidding.' Fans have since taken to Twitter in their droves to express their dismay at Jamie's reported decision - which comes just two weeks after the film opened to mixed reviews. Steamy: Jamie stars with actress Dakota Johnson in 50 Shades Of Grey, which opened to mixed reviews on February 13 . One wrote: ‘Was going to go see Fifty again today, but I think I'll hold off now until I know if @JamieDornan will continue.’ Another added: ‘Jamie Dornan won't appear in the next films of 50 Shades because his wife don't like it ... #whipped divorce her man.’ 'Surely Jamie Dornan's wife knew what to expect when he signed up for 50 Shades? I mean the books are hardly fluffy clouds and rainbows,' wrote a perplexed fan. Jamie's reported departure follows claims that director Sam Taylor-Johnson has quit the franchise following a series of furious bust-ups with author James. The Sun claim that the British director is keen to leave the franchise due to her constant on-set feuds with the author, despite previously claiming that she had 'signed on' to work on the sequels. Out of the franchise? Sam Taylor-Johnson is reportedly keen to pull out of directing the Fifty Shades Of Grey sequels after on-going bust ups with the books' author, E.L. James . A senior film insider told newspaper's Dan Wootton: 'Sam won't be back for the Fifty Shades sequels. She wants out and Universal knows that's the right decision. 'Her relationship with Erika has become absolutely toxic – they despise each other and blame each other for the problems with the film.' Sam and E.L. - who signed a £3million deal with Universal and Focus Films giving them the rights to her trio of books, which also gave her creative control of the movies - are said to have clashed numerous times about sex scenes as the author wanted to make the movie racier. The source also claimed that most of the rows between the two were due to the author's wishes for the film to be as explicit as the book. Difficult working relationship: E.L. James and the director have admitted that they found working together a challenge due to different artistic ideals . 'But Sam pushed back because she wanted the movie to be more than just a collection of S&M scenes,' they added. It was not officially confirmed that Sam would return to direct the sequels, although she had hinted that she was in the pipeline. 'I have a feeling discussions are going on behind closed doors but I've heard nothing so I'm as in the dark as everybody else on this,' the director revealed in a recent interview with The Independent. A representative for Sam has told MailOnline that 'the studio have not committed to a sequel as yet' and that they decline to comment further on the matter. Sam has  openly admitted she and E.L would 'often clash' while making the film and she recently revealed she was banned from using a jellyfish in a sex scene, while the author also admitted the pair 'butted heads'. Tension: E.L James (left) and Sam Taylor-Johnson (right) have toured the world together to promote the film along with the film's leading stars, including Dakota Johnson (centre) Despite E.L.'s bust-ups with Sam, the two main stars of the movie, Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson - who play Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele - were said to have been happy with the filmmaker. And although they are fans of working with her, they won't have the option to leave the franchise as they have signed tight contracts to keep them in the next two films, each which will be based on the follow-up novels Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed. In a previous interview, director Sam admitted that filming the controversial film with the writer close at hand was often trying. 'It was difficult, I'm not going to lie,' she confessed. 'It was difficult': The British filmmaker has previously admitted to the challenge of working with the author . 'We would have proper on-set barneys and I'm not confrontational. But it was about finding a way between the two of us.' Hollywood sources previously claimed that the director and author even rowed about the final word in the film, with Sam favouring 'red', a 'safe word' used in the bedroom by the protagonists, and James insisting on 'stop'. It was, says one insider, 'the most petty and ridiculous argument in the world' and the climax of months of tension between the pair. But E.L - who has sold 100million copies of her novel - apparently, 'was given a lot of power and has used every opportunity to flex that power'. Success: E.L. is said to have wanted to keep the film as close to the erotic book as possible . Another source who spoke to the Mail last week week claims the popular writer even threatened to tell her millions of fans across the world to boycott cinemas when the film was released on Valentine's Day if she didn't get her own way. Sam recently responded rather bluntly to these rumours: 'I should hope not,' she retorted, when asked about them. Despite the on-going professional scuffle between the two women, Fifty Shades Of Grey has gone on to become a huge success. The raunchy film dominated cinemas at the weekend with ticket sales of £13.5 million since its release on Friday. Erotic: The film is filled with raunchy and intimate scenes between the lead characters Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and Anastacia Steele (Dakota Johnson) It outstripped the competition - taking in more in ticket sales than the rest of the top 10 films combined and becoming the most successful 18-certificate film ever in the UK and Ireland. According to Deadline.com, Fifty Shades Of Grey became the US' biggest February opening of all time with an impressive haul of $93 million. The S&M-themed film took £4.6 million in the UK on its opening night, which is the most ever for a certificate 18 film. It broke the previous record of £3.19 million set by 2009 comedy The Hangover. And many cinemas sold out of tickets. The hype around the film, which is based on the books by E.L James, saw some venues sell out as early as two weeks ago after film fans rushed to make advance bookings. MailOnline has contacted a representative Universal and is awaiting comment. Disagreements: Sam is said to have wanted the film to not be all about the S&M scenes, while writer E.L. had a differing opinion on how her book should look on the big screen .","Fans have taken to Twitter to express disappointment at the shocking news .

"A flag collector has sparked fury by hoisting a Nazi swastika up a 20ft pole outside his home – before claiming he did not know what it represented. Martin Baker, 53, flew the red and black Waffen SS flag at the front of his house in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, on Friday night - before taking it down hours later on Saturday morning. Now, Mr Baker - who has more than 100 flags in his collection and has been flying them outside his home for seven years - has apologised and admitted he was ‘still not sure what the flag means’. Faced fury: Martin Baker, 53, flew the red and black Waffen SS flag at the front of his house in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, on Friday night - before taking it down hours later on Saturday morning . Collector: Mr Baker (pictured with his 53-year-old wife Sharon) - who has been flying flags outside his home for seven years - has apologised and admitted he was 'still not sure what the flag means' He said: ‘I don’t want to upset anyone so I took it down as soon as people started contacting me explaining about the fuss it was causing. I am not part of any right-wing group, I’m not a fascist. ‘It is nothing like that at all. It is all down to me being ignorant and I can’t apologise enough. I took it down straight away. I just want to put the record straight. ‘There was no motive behind it, it was purely down to my ignorance as to what it represented then and what it represents now. I am still not sure what the flag means.’ Mr Baker, who lives with his wife Sharon, 53, began his flag fascination in 2008 by putting up a pole outside his £280,000 detached four-bedroom house after a local garage was disposing of them.

Original idea: The Leeds United season ticket holder had initially planned to use the flagpole to fly a flag showing his support for the football club . The Leeds United season ticket holder had initially planned to use the flagpole to fly a flag showing his support for the Championship football club. But since then he has started collecting and displaying a wide variety of flags representing different countries and causes - including military and country flags. Mr Baker added: ‘I bought the flag on the internet and I will now be getting rid of it. I normally fly flags on a two-week cycle, but I am not putting any more up for a while. ‘The next one I put up will say love, peace and happiness on it. I will be more careful next time.’ Mr Baker said none of the flags he had flown before had ever landed him in hot water. The Waffen-SS, which existed between 1933 and 1945, was the combat arm of the Nazi party's Schutzstaffel - and condemned at the Nuremberg Trials as being part of a criminal organisation.","Martin Baker, 53, flew red and black Waffen SS flag at front of his house .

"No willpower? Always reaching for treats and junk food, even when you're trying to keep healthy? This latest product promises to help with the struggle when you are on a diet - by by sealing your treats in a time locked vault with no way of getting them out until the timer runs out. The Kitchen Safe is a plastic container that can be used to keep any sweets, chocolates or unhealthy snacks out of reach. There is no override switch on the Kitchen Safe, meaning once the sweets are in, they cannot come out until the timer reaches zero . It uses a time lock which makes the container impenetrable. There is no override switch meaning once the sweets are in, they cannot come out until the timer reaches zero. The timer can be set to lock for between one minute to 10 days. The safe can store food items such as cookies, and sweets, for any time from one minute up to 10 days . The company behind the invention hopes that it will remove the temptation of eating unhealthy food for people on a diet. David Krippendorf created the Kitchen Safe in the States along with Nick and Ryan Tseng - and it is now available in the UK. The safe is made out of thick plastic . Mr Krippendorf said: 'The Kitchen Safe helps people achieve their goals by limiting and avoiding temptations. 'We've had people tell us they've lost weight, quit smoking, or just maintain a more healthy diet. 'It was something that I wanted and needed for myself. I wanted to avoid the temptation that led me to nibble on food throughout the day. 'Now I have three Kitchen Safes in my home and put different items in each..

"A Ukrainian military parade to show-off armoured vehicles used in the fight against pro-Russian rebels has backfired after a soldier  fell off a tank, leaving him unconscious. The embarrassing accident happened during the exercise outside the city of Debaltseve in south-eastern Ukraine's Donetsk Oblast region, where fierce fighting between regime soldiers and separatist forces has taken place in recent weeks. Journalists were lined up along the road as the tank came rumbling past, packed with soldiers who were clinging to the top supposedly ready for battle. But as the tank swerved slightly to the right, one of the soldiers toppled off and landed heavily on the ground, lying there motionless afterwards and unable to move. Scroll down for video . Parade: Journalists were lined up alongside the road in as the tank came rumbling past, packed with soldiers who were clinging to the top supposedly ready for battle . Don't slip: While speeding along the road the tank swerved slightly to the right and a soldier toppled off . The footage shows the soldier trying to stand to his position, and then losing his balance. Witness Malik Kundra  said: 'We all ran over but the soldier didn't get up. He was taken away and I don't know what happened to him after that, as we weren't given any other information.' According to the Ukrainian army's own military rules, it is illegal to transport people on tanks in the winter and especially not when travelling more than 30 mph. However when it was posted online a lot of people have a less charitable interpretation, saying the soldier was obviously only looking for a ticket back home and away from the front line. The Ukrainian military, which had been in control of Debaltseve during the month-long siege by pro-Russian rebels, were ordered to withdraw by Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko recently and after they left, pro-Russian rebel forces began to enter the destroyed town. Don't stand up: The footage shows the soldier trying to stand to his position, and then losing his balance . Tumble: According to the Ukrainian army's own military rules, it is illegal to transport people on tanks in the winter and especially not when travelling more than 30 mph . It was thought that the end to full-scale fighting in the strategically located city might give fresh hope to the ceasefire that was signed in Minsk on Feb. 12. However, as fighting in Debaltseve began to scale down, shelling was reported in the port city of Mariupol in the south of Ukraine and in the city of Donetsk, a pro-rebel stronghold. The conflict has claimed the lives of 5,692 people and left 14,122 wounded, according to a United Nations report. The true figure is likely to increase as Ukrainian commanders account for the captured and missing troops. Howitzers were seen moving east Tuesday from the largest rebel-held city in eastern Ukraine further into separatist-controlled territory, but the Ukrainian government disputed the rebels' claim that a heavy weapons pullback had begun. A peace plan worked out in marathon talks on Feb. 12 aims to create a wide buffer zone between separatists' and Ukrainian forces' artillery as part of efforts to end the conflict that has left nearly 5,800 dead since April. The disagreement over a weapons pullback came as talks about a fragile peace deal for Ukraine were underway in Paris between the foreign ministers of Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France. Pain: The soldier landed heavily on the ground, lying there motionless afterwards and unable to move . Unconscious: Witness Malik Kundra said: 'We all ran over but the soldier didn't get up. He was taken away and I don't know what happened to him after that, as we weren't given any other information' The supposed cease-fire in eastern Ukraine has been troubled by violations. On Tuesday, military spokesman Lt. Col. Anatoliy Stelmakh said rebels had shelled the town of Popasna seven times and launched one barrage on the village of Luhanske. Stelmakh also said rebels tried to storm Ukrainian positions near the southern village of Shyrokyne, which is near the strategic Azov Sea port of Mariupol. Concerns persists that rebels aim to take Mariupol to help establish a land corridor between mainland Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed last March. Russia denies Ukrainian and Western claims that it is supplying the rebels with troops and equipment, with the possible aim of a full-scale war. Russian President Vladimir Putin, in an interview Monday with state television, said 'such an apocalyptic scenario is hardly possible.' Western officials and NATO insist, however, that satellite photos show that Russian military equipment is in eastern Ukraine.","Ukrainian solider was one of a group of fighters sitting on top of a tank .

"Pastor Jehoshaphat Air Wibowo and his funeral director Suhendra Putro stood in the tiny, hot room at the Javanese Christian church yesterday in Cilicap, making some of the final preparations for the looming executions of Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. With airforce jets on standby and their latest court appeal rejected, Chan and Sukumaran moved one step closer to being flown from their jail cell in Bali, 900 kilometres to the west, to this port town, which supplies Nusa Kambangan, also known as Death Island, where they will be shot to death. Cilacap appears more than ready. Since the first coffins arrived last week for the expected executions of 11 convicts on death row for drug offences, Mr Putro has brought in another six. Other equipment recently arrived are six large wooden crosses, six pillows, six satin covers and six sets of cross-shaped coffin nails, individually bagged the way that furniture stores, such as Ikea, package their screws. Scroll down for video . Funeral director Suhendra Putro shows the bill for the six new coffins arriving from Yogyakarta in the warehouse of Java Christian Church, Cilacap district, Central Java, Indonesia . With airforce jets on standby and a failed court appeal it seems that Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran are one step closer to being flown from their Bali jail cell 900km west to Cilacap and taken to the island to be shot . The bill (right) that Mr Putro had just paid for included the cost of the cross-shaped coffin nails (left) Mr Putro said a jumbo-sized coffin was ordered for a bigger person such as Sukumaran . 'We have several sized coffins. Standard or medium size is for most people and jumbo size is for bigger people,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'Foreigners are bigger than Indonesians. Maybe Australians. Chan is not big. Mr Sukumaran, he is big, yes?' The jumbo-sized coffin among Mr Putro's stack at the church is at two metres long - no longer than the medium-sized - but with a considerably wider girth, around 90 centimetres wide rather than about 75 centimetres. 'It is not the stomach,' Mr Putro said, crossing his arms to show how a body was placed in a coffin, 'It is the shoulders.' He paid about six million Rupiah - around $600 Australian dollars - for the coffins and funeral items from a firm in Yokyakarta, which is a four-hour drive from Cilacap along a traffic choked highway. The coffins and their corresponding crosses, covers and pillows, arrived in the past few days. The jumbo coffin is two metres long - the same as the medium-sized boxes - but with a considerably wider girth, around 90cm wide rather than about 75cm . With up to 11 murderers and drug traffickers including Chan (right) and Sukumaran (left) scheduled for execution on Nusakambangan soon, Mr Putro might be two coffins short . Mr Putro bought in another six coffins along with six large wooden crosses, six pillows, six satin covers and six sets of cross-shaped coffin nails, individually bagged the way that furniture stores package their screws . Mr Putro (right) paid just under six million Rupiah for coffin and funeral items from a firm in Yokyakarta, which is a four-hour drive down a traffic choked highway east of Cilacap . A receipt showed six 'puti' or coffins for 4.05 million Rupiah ($401.81), six 'salib' or crosses for 420,000 Rupiah ($41.67), six 'slove' or pillows for 180,000 Rupiah ($17.86), six ' tule' or covers at 480,000 Rupiah ($47.64), plus ' kirim' or transport at 750,000 Rupiah ($74.44) and a 70,000 Rupiah ($6.95) fee for a man to help lift the coffins. With up to 11 murderers and drug traffickers including Chan and Sukumaran scheduled for execution on Nusa Kambangan soon, Mr Putro worries he might be two coffins short. Mr Putro, who has been a mortician since 1992 and considers his profession 'a calling from God' said he did not know whether he would need medium or jumbo-sized because 'the police haven't told me yet'. But there was no time to order in any more of the specially made white ruched satin style he currently had. 'They will be plain, no material because it is an emergency order,' he said. Meanwhile he, his assistant Mr Sulamin and Paster Wibowo are keeping the coffins in a hot, dry room with mothballs, so as to prevent mold or insects from damaging them. Police patrolling the waters surrounding Nusakambangan - dubbed 'Death Island' The medium coffins weighed about 60kg and the jumbo size was about 70kg and if it rained on proceedings, the wooden structures absorbed about another 10kg in weight . Struggling to shift the caskets in the tiny crowded room with Mr Sulamin on one end and himself on the other, Mr Putro said each one weighed about 60kg, although the jumbo size was about 70kg and if it rained on proceedings, the wooden structures absorbed about another 10kg in weight. He said he was on standby for the police to give him the word that the executions would go ahead. 'Then on the day, the ambulances will come, one for each, with the coffins labelled for each prisoner and the ambulances also named,' he said. 'Then I will go at 10pm to the island and wait for the executions. Afterwards the bodies are placed on tables and myself and my assistants go and prepare them for the coffins. Mr Putro said he did not personally pray for the souls of the condemned prisoners: 'but I pray I can carry out a good and proper job.' Mr Putro said he did not personally pray for the souls of the condemned prisoners: 'but I pray I can carry out a good and proper job' The coffins are kept in a hot, dry room with mothballs, so as to prevent mold or insects from damaging them . He said three of the five inmates exectuted on Nusakambangan Island on January 18 this year 'had smiles on their faces' when he has dressed their bodies. Four Indonesian and five foreign prisoners apart from Chan and Sukumaran are listed for possible execution in this 'round'. The Indonesians are multiple murderers Syofial aka Iyen Bin Anwar, Harun bin Ajis and Sargawi aka Ali Bin Sanusi and Zainal Abidim, who imported 58.7kg of cannabis. The foreigners are Mary Jane Veloso, Filipina importer of 2.6kg of heroin, French ecstasy lab operator Serge Ataloui, Ghanian Martin Anderson who imported just 50g of heroin, Nigerian Raheem Agbaje Salami (5.3kg of heroin) and the mentally ill Brazilian inmate, Rodrigo Gularte, who has been on the island for most of the eight years since he imported heroin in surfboards. Andrew Chan, 31, and Myuran Sukumaran, 33, were convicted in 2005 in relation to the 'Bali Nine' heroin importing ring of 8.3kg of the drug. Pastor Wibowo said he would offer his help to give religious counsel to any of the men or women who were to be executed, but that he did not believe in it. 'I say only God has the right [to take someone's life] not the government,' he said. There was no time to order in any more of the specially made white ruched satin style  so any extra coffins will be plain, because it is an 'emergency order' An indonesian soldier seen near two military trucks on the Wijaya Pura port in front of Nusa Kambangan Island, Central Java, Indonesia on Tuesday .

"Philip Cox contracted Legionnaires' Disease on a holiday to the Ca'an San Apartments in Santa Eulalia, Ibiza that left him hospitalised and off work for five weeks. The holidaymaker, from Teignmouth, Devon, is taking legal action against Thomson Holidays after finding out that a fellow holidaymaker died from the disease only a number of weeks later after staying at the same resort. Mr Cox, and his wife Karen, 55, visited the apartments in September 2014 for a two-week stay, along with Mr Cox's sister and her partner. On his return to the UK from a stay at the Ca'an San Apartments in Santa Eulalia, Ibiza, Philip Cox was diagnosed with Legionnaires' Disease and placed on a drip . Prior to the group flying home, Mr Cox fell ill, suffering with diarrhoea, a fever, shortness of breath and nausea. When he returned to the UK he visited his local GP and the next day he was admitted to hospital, where he was diagnosed with Legionnaires' Disease and placed on an IV drip. He stayed in hospital for five days and was then discharged. Mr Cox was absent from work for five weeks. His sister's partner also suffered an unconfirmed illness whilst staying at the apartments and was prescribed medicine at a clinic in Ibiza. Since returning to the UK, Mr Cox discovered that Lynne Balaam, from Cardiff, who stayed at the same C'an Sanso Apartments, died in hospital in Spain after reportedly contracting Legionnaires' Disease. He alleges Thomson Holidays previously claimed that there is no clear link between the illness that caused Ms Balaam's death and water contamination at the C'an Sanso apartments. However, the apartments were closed some days after Ms Balaam tested positive for Legionella. Mr Cox and his wife say that they were originally told by Thomson Holidays that his illness was an isolated case and that they would not be investigating the cause further. Last year the C'an Sanso Apartments were forced to relocate guests following an outbreak of Legionnaires' However since his illness and the death of Ms Balaam, guests due to stay at the apartments have been relocated to alternative accommodation. Mr Cox said: 'The whole experience was extremely scary for myself, my wife and my children, as well as my grandchildren, as my symptoms quickly got worse when I got home and I ended up on oxygen and a drip in hospital. It's the last thing which you expect when you go on holiday. 'It was frightening to find out that another holidaymaker at C'an Sanso Apartments had died after contracting the same illness that I had suffered. 'I was very frustrated that the tour operator told me my illness was an isolated case and that they would not be investigating further. I was extremely concerned that other people staying at the resort would not be aware of the issues. Mr Cox travelled to Ibiza with his wife Karen, but his holiday took a turn for the worse when he fell violently ill . 'During our stay we noticed algae in the swimming pool and we felt the pool didn't appear to be cleaned correctly. There was also a problem with the water in the apartment as the shower would run hot and cold. 'I am very lucky that I received the correct diagnosis and treatment so quickly, but I was still forced to take time off work. 'Hopefully, my legal team's investigations will lead to answers about why I contracted Legionnaires' Disease and help to ensure others do not have to go through the same experience I have endured.' A spokesperson for Thomson has told MailOnline Travel that the company is 'sorry' to hear that Mr Cox contracted the illness. 'We believed there was a heightened risk of water contamination towards the end of October and, as a precaution, Thomson arranged alternative accommodation for all guests who were either staying in or due to travel to the hotel until the end of the season,' the spokesperson said. The C'an Sanso Apartments in Ibiza whereMr Cox was staying with his wife and family . 'Thomson also contacted all customers who stayed at the apartments in October to check if they felt unwell. As this case is now subject to legal proceedings it would be inappropriate for us to comment further. 'Thomson closely audits all of the hotels to which we operate to ensure they meet our high health and safety standards. We would like to reassure customers that situations such as this are extremely rare.' Amandeep Dhillon, an expert international personal injury lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, who is representing a number of holidaymakers who suffered from the outbreak said: 'Legionnaires Disease is a very serious illness and can be fatal in some cases due to the respiratory complications it can cause. 'The immediate priorities now are ensuring anyone affected receives the help and support they need as well as identifying the cause of the illness as soon as possible. 'We have acted in several previous outbreaks of Legionnaires Disease. Our work on behalf of victims of fatal outbreaks at the Diamante Beach Hotel in Calpe, Spain where sadly four victims died with many others left fighting for their lives, as well as closer to home in both Edinburgh and Stoke-on-Trent in recent years, means we have seen first-hand the devastating impact Legionnaires Disease can have on victims. 'The seriousness of such illnesses cannot be underestimated and it is vital that public health authorities in Spain, and the hotel management work to quickly to locate the source of these problems and provide holidaymakers with the answers they deserve. 'We shall be working closely with our Spanish colleagues to investigate this outbreak and establish the level of investigations that have to date been made by the Spanish authorities. On the basis of the information we have at the moment, any legal proceedings would be pursued in England. 'As we conduct our investigations we ask anyone who has stayed at the C'an Sanso Apartments and may be able to help provide information about the conditions, to get in contact with us as they may be able to help with the case.'","Philip Cox and his wife Karen had booked Ibiza stay with Thomson .

"It’s the multi-talented kitchen appliance which boasts thousands of loyal users around the world and now Australia’s Governor General wants one – but not everyone in the senate is clued-up on the Thermomix craze. The Governor General’s office put out a tender for $80,000 - $100,000 worth of new kitchen equipment during a Senate hearing on Tuesday but Labor senator Joe Ludwig was left baffled by one pricey item on the list. Senator Ludwig read through the request for kitchen appliances for Sir Peter Cosgroves’ two residences - Yarralumla in Canberra and Admiralty House in Sydney – saying: ‘You're seeking four stick blenders, two food processors... and you're going to have to help me with this - a Thermomix?’ ‘I don't know what a Thermomix is,’ Senator Ludwig said. Committee chair and South Australian senator Cory Bernardi ridiculed him, asking: ‘Where have you been?’ Scroll down for video . The Governor General's office has requested a Thermomix but the Governor General's official secretary Mark Fraser (left) was forced to confess to Labor senator Joe Ludwig (right) he didn't know what it is . The Governor General’s (pictured) office put out a tender for $80,000 - $100,000 worth of new kitchen equipment . ‘Queensland,’ Senator Ludwig responded. ‘A kitchen aid mixer, an upright freezer, a deep fryer and a pasta machine. And what's a Thermomix?,’ he continued. The Governor General's official secretary, Mark Fraser, confessed: ‘I don't know what a Thermomix is.’ ‘So there are a couple of us who don't know what a Thermomix is,’ Senator Ludwig announced. Attempting to fill the Senate's Finance and Public Administration Committee in on the almost $2,000 kitchen toy, Senator Bernardi explained: ‘They're very popular amongst the home masterchefs of today.’ The German-designed 'twelve appliances in one' device has an almost cult-like following. They cannot be bought in stores, and shoppers hold 'Thermomix parties' similar to Tupperware parties where a Thermomix consultant comes out to a customer's home and demonstrates how it works to a group of their friends. There are more than 3000 Thermomix consultants across Australia. ‘Is that the elite trendies that use that, are they?’ asked Senator Ludwig. The German-designed 'twelve appliances in one' device called a Thermomix has an almost cult-like following . South Australian senator Cory Bernardi described the Thermomix as 'very popular amongst the home masterchefs of today' ‘In Queensland, you may refer to them as that, I just refer to them as those who have a particular interest in cooking,’ Senator Bernardi retorted. Noticing he’d touched a nerve, Senator Ludwig probed: ‘Is that the new model or the old model?’ 'I'm no Masterchef myself all I know is that my team and with the expert advice of kitchen consultants have given us advice on the sorts of things our kitchen requires in order for it to function properly ' Mr Fraser said. Senator Ludwig then took the opportunity to point out how much the Governor General’s office is spending elsewhere. 'You have $168,000 spent on redundancies, one involuntary, you have a request for a speechwriter and a media advisor… the previous Governor General managed not to require them. ‘And now you have a couple hundred thousand spent on that amount, plus an additional amount on kitchen appliances. You wonder where the priorities are,’ he said. But Mr Fraser reasoned that they need the new kitchen appliances to maintain the ‘heritage properties’. ‘We're seeking to do so in the most efficient manner possible hence we're seeking to replace 14 kitchen items,’ he said.","Governor General's office has asked for $80,000 - $100,000 worth of kitchen equipment including a Thermomix .

"Police in northern Thailand are trying to locate a presumed Chinese tourist who was filmed kicking a prayer bell at a Buddhist temple. Thai officials have threatened to ban the tourist over the incident at Wat Phra That Doi Suthep, a sacred site near the city of Chiang Mai. The footage shows the man ringing a bell with his hand as he poses for a photo and then pausing for several seconds before kicking a bell hanging several feet off the ground. Thai authorities are threatening to ban a man who kicked a bell at Wat Phra That Doi Suthep . The incident at the 14th century temple, a popular tourist site, has caused outrage in Thailand and added another layer to the strained relationship between locals and Chinese tourists. Major General Bundit Tungkhaseranee, a local commander, told the Bangkok Post that immigration and local police are looking for witnesses and examining CCTV to identify the man after the video went viral on social media. Police have been interviewing Chinese guides and travel agents, and have been checking outbound Chinese tourists as they arrive at border checkpoints. The police commander told the newspaper that authorities are keen to apprehend the man, introduce him to the public and give him a lesson on Thai culture and manners. He said the man will be banned from Thailand if he refuses to listen. The footage shows a man kicking a bell hanging several feet off the ground at the popular attraction . The incident at the 14th century temple, near the city of Chiang Mai, has caused outrage in Thailand . Chuan Patwan, an administrator at Wat Phra That Doi Suthep, urged tour operators to educate their clients about temple etiquette. He told Khaosod: ‘It will take some time to say whether the tourist is actually Chinese. But judging from his style, he was kicking his feet with so much agility, it was like kung fu.’ The incident comes a week after Thailand’s tourist board announced that it would be handing out etiquette manuals to Chinese tourists who were visiting during Chinese New Year. The manuals outlined how the holidaymakers are expected to behave while they visit Thailand. An administrator for Doi Suthep urged tour operators to educate their clients about temple etiquette . The temple was expected to be a popular destination for tourists over the Chinese New Year holiday . They were created after the Thai government received complaints from locals, who accused Chinese visitors of defecating in public, causing traffic accidents with reckless driving, and defacing tourist attractions. Chinese tourists were temporarily banned from even entering Wat Rong Khun, the Buddhist White Temple in Chiang Rai, after complaints that they had ruined the toilets. The Tourist Authority of Thailand estimated that at least 90,000 tourists would arrive from China over the holiday, with Wat Phra That Doi Suthep a popular destination. Earlier this month, photos surfaced online showing a Chinese tourist’s underwear draped over chairs at Chiang Mai airport, angering fellow travellers and drawing complaints about inappropriate behaviour on social media channels.","Incident at Wat Phra That Doi Suthep has caused outrage in Thailand .

"First-time Academy Award nominee and screenplay writer Graham Moore opened up about his suicidal past as a teenager while he accepted an award for his work on The Imitation Game. As Moore took the stage after winning the award for Best Adapted Screenplay at the 87th Annual Academy Awards, he spoke about trying to take his own life at the age of 16 during his touching  speech. The 33-year-old was inspired by the main character in his film, Alan Turing, who changed the course of the war benefiting the allies after he helped crack a German code during the Second World War. Turing was convicted later in his life for being openly gay. Moore has come out saying he is not gay following assumptions with his connection to Turing, and said he was moved by Turing's story because he dealt with depression, according to BuzzFeed. Scroll down for video . First-time Academy Award nominee and screenplay writer Graham Moore (above) opened up about his suicidal past as a teenager while he accepted an award for his work on The Imitation Game . The 33-year-old (left) was inspired by the main character in his film, Alan Turing (played by Benedict Cumberbatch, left, in scenes from The Imitation Game), who changed the course of the war benefiting the allies after he helped crack a German code during the Second World War. Turing was convicted later in his life for being openly gay . Moore said that while he could stand in front of everyone, Turing could not because he took his own life at 41 years old. And to Moore, that was the 'most unfair thing he has ever heard' (above Cumberbatch pictured bottom, with cast mates, from left: Keira Knightley, Matthew Beard, Matthew Goode and Allen Leech in scenes from the film) He said that while everyone feels like 'weirdos' for various reasons, that just like Turing, he also had his own share of quirks which made him drawn to his story. During his speech, Moore said that while he could stand in front of everyone, Turing could not because he took his own life at 41 years old. And for him, because Turing never had that chance, it was the 'most unfair thing he has ever heard'. 'When I was 16, I tried to kill myself because I felt weird and I felt different and I felt like I did not belong,' he said. 'I would like this moment to be for the kid out there who feels like she's weird and different and feels like she doesn't belong. Yes, you do. I promise you do.

And then, when it's your turn and you are standing on this stage, please pass the same message to the next person who comes along.' Moore, who has not previously spoken openly about depression, said that he did not have every word of his speech planned out but that it was already loosely in his head.

Dame Sally Davies is urging the House of Lords to approve the landmark law, ahead of a debate on the subject. MPs voted earlier this month in the Commons to legalise the controversial mitochondrial donation technique, which critics say will lead to 'three parent babies'. If the House of Lords gives the go ahead - which seems likely - Britain will become the first country in the world to permit the procedures, aimed at preventing serious inherited mitochondrial diseases. Opponents, including church leaders and pro-life groups, have warned that the change has been brought about too hastily and marked the start of a 'slippery slope' towards designer babies and eugenics. But chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies said she believes the Lords should vote in favour of the amendment to the 2008 Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act. Scientists at Newcastle University have developed a way of swapping the mother-to-be's diseased mitochondria – the 'batteries' that give cells energy – with healthy ones from another woman's egg. Dame Sally said: 'I want them to consider in the Lords what this is. It's quite separate from the illegal act of changing DNA in the nucleus. 'It would give these women their own children and these families hope, and I believe this is right. 'We have a very strong regulatory system that would regulate first the service and secondly would review every individual case before they could happen.' The Government's most senior health advisor admitted if the treatment fails there would be an increased miscarriage rate, but added that there was 'no expectation of that'. Critics have pointed out no clinical trial has taken place to show conclusively that the treatments are safe in humans. However, three separate expert reviews for the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority found that the technique is ready to go forward. Dame Sally said: 'The only clinical tests you can do are either in rats, mice and monkeys - and those have been done - or in humans and the mothers now want to do this following those three scientific reviews. 'I wouldn't call it a test, but the first cases will be scrutinised very carefully.' She also denied the legislation would lead to a 'slippery slope' giving way to the creation of designer babies.

However critics argue there is a small risk of diseased mitochondria could be carried over too (point 4) 'This is about changing the battery packs, it's not about touching the chromosomes that make us what we are,' Dame Sally said. 'The nucleus is sacrosanct and it is illegal to touch it. 'There is no debate, nor needs there to be, about touching the chromosome, we are not talking about that, we are talking about mitochondrial transfer.' Research has shown that mitochondrial donation could potentially help almost 2,500 women of reproductive age in the UK who are at risk of transmitting harmful DNA mutations in the mitochondria. It is estimated around 150 babies a year could, in future, be born as a result of the technique. The child would have 'nuclear' DNA determining individual traits such as facial features and personality from its two parents, plus a tiny amount of mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) from an anonymous female donor. A free vote in the Commons saw 382 MPs vote in favour of the controversial technology. Some 128 voted against. David Cameron, who voted in favour of the change, said it was not 'playing God' but the chance to hep parents have a 'healthy and happy baby'. If the change is passed there, it would not become law until October. The first baby conceived with the treatment could be born as early as next year. The British scientist who invented the technology welcome the vote. After MPs voted to legalise mitochondrial donation in the Commons earlier this month, a debate will be heard in the House of Lords today . Speaking following the vote in the Commons, Professor Doug Turnbull, Professor of Neurology at Newcastle University, said: 'I'm delighted for patients with mitochondrial disease. This is an important hurdle in the development of this new IVF technique but we still have the debate in the House of Lords, and importantly the licensing by the HFEA. 'Finally, I think the quality of the debate shows what a robust scientific, ethical and legislative procedure we have in the UK for IVF treatments. This is important and something the UK should rightly be proud of.' But some 50 MEPs have written to the Prime Minister calling for him to withdraw the legislation, which is due to be debated in the Lords today. Meanwhile a group of Italian MPs have also called on the House of Lords to vote against the plans. Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, said on Sunday, that any delay in approving this law would be 'a cruel and unnecessary delay after seven years of investigation, consultation, parliamentary discussion and scrutiny'. He added: 'Much opposition is coming from well-organised campaigns from Catholics from Latin America and Eastern Europe. But if we cannot make any alteration, then we will deny ourselves the possibility of ever improving life for those who suffer from these intractable conditions. 'Turning our backs on these advances is uncaring and unloving. We live in an exciting time for medical research and we must support caring scientists and doctors with the resources and proper regulations to do their work.' Mitochondrial donation would allow IVF babies to be born with DNA from three different people should the technique be made legal. It involves replacing DNA in an egg in order to prevent devastating inherited mitochondrial diseases. WHAT ARE MITOCHONDRIA? Mitochondria are tiny rod-like structures in cells which act as power houses, generating the energy that allows our bodies to function. Unusually, they have their own DNA, distinct from the genetic material within the cell nucleus. Mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) makes up about 0.1 per cent of a cell's total DNA and does not affect individual characteristics such as appearance and personality. WHAT CAUSES MITOCHONDRIAL DISEASE? Harmful mutations in mitochondrial DNA can prevent the mitochondria working properly, resulting in a number of diseases some of which can be serious and life threatening. They may affect major organs and cause conditions ranging from poor vision to diabetes and muscle wasting. HOW ARE MITOCHONDRIAL DISEASES PASSED ON? Children may inherit mitochondrial DNA defects from their mothers, but not their fathers. People with faulty mDNA can develop symptoms or be carriers of the condition without experiencing ill-effects themselves. WHAT IS MITOCHONDRIAL DONATION? Defective mDNA from a mother's egg can be replaced with healthy mDNA from a donor. This will then prevent the harmful mutations being inherited and passed on to future generations. WHAT ARE THE TECHNIQUES INVOLVED? There are two different procedures, one carried out before fertilisation and the other after. Maternal Spindle Transfer (MST) involves first removing the nuclear DNA from a donor egg whose mitochondria are healthy. The 'spindle' of chromosomes containing the mother's nuclear DNA is then taken from her egg and inserted into the donor egg. As a result, the donor egg is left with nuclear DNA from the mother and mDNA from the donor. This healthy egg is then fertilised and implanted into the mother's womb. Pronuclear Transfer (PT) is similar but in this case the mother's egg is fertilised first. Its nuclear DNA is then transferred to a fertilised donor egg, containing healthy mitochondria, whose own nuclear DNA has been removed. This healthy fertilised egg is then implanted. HOW SAFE IS MITOCHONDRIAL DONATION? Animal and laboratory experiments suggest that the procedures are safe, but no-one can say that the risk is zero. Three separate reviews by an expert panel convened by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology's Authority have found no evidence that the techniques are unsafe for clinical use. Critics argue that problems might only arise once the procedure is used to create human babies. For instance, replacing mDNA might have more of an impact on personal traits than had been envisaged. Unknown epigenetic effects, environmental influences that alter the way genes work, may also have serious consequences for the health of babies, it is claimed.","Dame Sally Davies is urging House of Lords to approve historic law .

"His fascination with taxidermy began after he found hedgehog bones under an outdoor building at primary school. Now 12-year-old Archie Crawford shares his bedroom in Kidlington, Oxfordshire, with a 75-strong collection of stuffed animals - including a buzzard, raccoon, marmot and even an armadillo. The boy, who first read about taxidermy online and also keeps roadkill in his family’s freezer, has stuffed squirrels, rats and mice - and his creations take pride of place in his room.

Young taxidermy enthusiast: Archie Crawford shares his bedroom in Kidlington, Oxfordshire, with a 75-strong collection of stuffed animals - including a buzzard, racoon, marmot and even an armadillo . Storage: The boy, who keeps roadkill in his family’s freezer (left), has stuffed squirrels, rats and mice and his creations take pride of place in his room (right) He said: ‘I love skeletons, fossils and skulls. I think taxidermy is really cool and I am going to keep practising until I am able to do it for my profession. ‘My favourite pieces of taxidermy are the ones that look like they are alive, like my armadillo, which was a present. I would love to be able to create that one day. ‘I love animals and nature, and I am really interested in creating my own pieces. Some people think it is an odd habit but most of my friends think it is interesting.’ Archie has even managed to convince his mother, Polly Branney, 47, to make some space in the family freezer for dead pheasants, squirrels, rabbits and moles which he is working on. Mrs Branney, a GP, said: ‘It all started when Archie was seven and he found some bones at school.

Among the ice and potato waffles: The family currently have a squirrel and a skinned rabbit in their freezer . ‘I was shocked when he brought them home but we cleaned them up and he researched them on the internet and found out they were hedgehog bones. Archie, 12, said he is 'really dedicated' to taxidermy . 'Archie reassembled them onto a piece of card and his love of bones and structures began from there.’ She added: ‘He loves the outdoors and it’s great that he has curiosity for nature. It’s not ideal keeping his animals in the freezer but I know how much it means to him.’ Mrs Branney said the first roadkill Archie picked up was a dead fox, which he carried home after spotting it at school. She helped him cut it up and left it in the garden  to disintegrate before boiled the bones so he could work on his first piece. The family currently have a squirrel and a skinned rabbit in the freezer of their detached four-bedroom house. Mrs Branney said: ‘I help Archie dissect up the bits and it is a bit grisly but it doesn’t phase either of us. 'I think taxidermy is really up and coming, especially in America where lots of people have their pets stuffed. I am proud of his hobby.’ Archie added: ‘I want to be a taxidermist when I am older and I already know that I need to study art and science in order to do it, so that’s my aim. 'I am really dedicated to it and would love to expand my collection to some larger animals - my mum says that’s fine, as long as they can all fit in my room.’","Archie Crawford lives with stuffed animals in Kidlington, Oxfordshire .

"Tiffany Cole and Emilia Carr did not know each other before they were put on death row at Florida's Lowell Correctional Institution in Ocala. But now the women, who share incredibly similar stories, couldn't imagine life without each other. Sexually abused when they were young, the cellmates were both convicted of separate murder charges they say are wrong and are fighting to have their death penalties removed from their sentences. Carr, 30, is the is the youngest woman in the United States on death row, while Cole, 33, is the third youngest. 'It's legal murder,' Cole told ABC News' 20/20 program during an interview with Diane Sawyer, which will air in-full on Friday. Scroll down for video . To be executed: Tiffany Cole, 33 (left), and Emilia Carr, 30 (right) both received death penalties after being convicted of separate murder charges. Carr is the youngest woman on death row in the county . 'We call it life row': The women spend up to 24 hours a day locked in their cell . Defiant: Cole and Carr refused to believe they are going to be executed . Young: Emilia Carr, 30, is the youngest woman in the United States sitting on death row . 'How many rich people go to prison?' Carr added. 'We're all minorities. 'We're all people who are either minorities or didn't have any, money - any way to say, ''Hey, let me buy my freedom'', because it's not free in this country. 'Unfortunately, equality is an illusion.' Cole was 26 when she was found guilty of the kidnapping and first-degree murder of a Florida  husband and wife. Cole had lived next to them for years in South Carolina before moving to Jackonsville. Cole and three men robbed the couple before tying them up, driving them across the border to Georgia and burying them alive. The jury was shown photos of Cole and two co-defendants in a limousine, celebrating with champagne and handfuls of cash after the crime. The jury voted 9 to 3 that she should receive the death penalty. Arrested: Tiffany Cole, 33 (left), and Emilia Carr, 30 (right) are seen here in their mugshots after first being arrested around 2009 . Cole claims she helped dig the grave but that she did not know it was for the victims. She claims she thought the group were going to bury some of the items they had stolen. 'I am not the same person anymore,' Cole said. 'I have peace, I have joy. I have a sound mind.' Emilia  Carr was sentenced to death by lethal injection in 2011 for the 2009 murder of Heather Strong. Strong was the wife of Carr's boyfriend, and both were convicted of her suffocating her with a plastic bag and dumping the body in a Florida storage unit. Carr was eight months pregnant at the time and now has four children, but is not allowed to see any of them. She claims she had left before the murder was committed. 'Wouldn't there have been physical evidence?' she told ABC. 'I mean, duct tape is some sticky stuff, yet there's no finger prints, no DNA, no hair.' Both women had never been to jail before they were arrested. Now they spend 24 hours a day locked in a cell together. Three times a week they are allowed outside for two hours, but the area is concrete. 'I haven't touched grass in six years,' Carr said. 'So it's the small stuff you take for granted, you really do.' Scene: The women are inside Lowell Correctional Institution in Ocarla, Florida . Carr struggles being away from her kids, but said she has taught herself to deal with it. 'I think about them every day,' she said. 'Before I really even came to know God, that was the hardest thing for me to cope with day in and day out, was being away from my kids. 'When I got here, my hair was falling out just from stress.' Both women have lodged appeals, however the process takes an average of 10 to 12 years. They are not fighting their convictions, but want their sentences reduced from death to life in prison. They are both convinced they will not be executed. 'You can't have that mentality (that you're going to die), because that means you've accepted this,' Carr said. 'You've already died... you're already dead if you accept that,' Cole said. The women spend their days reading books. They are both religious and say that god and self-help books have turned their lives around. 'It's not over,' Cole said. 'There is forgiveness and there is hope.' However, the prosecutor in Cole's case, Jay Plotkin, thinks differently, telling ABC News: 'I was a prosecutor for more than 20 years. There was not any case that I prosecuted where the crime was more vile or cruel than the torture and murder of the Sumners. 'This case lingers on in the heart and soul of our community. 'Ms. Cole is certainly entitled to, and should, exhaust all of her legal rights to appeal. 'I am personally confident that she received more than adequate representation and a fair trial.'

Newsreader Michael Buerk (left) told his I'm a Celebrity campmates how he wished he had pushed disgraced TV presenter Jimmy Saville (right) over the edge of the Queen Elizabeth 2 cruise ship when he had the chance . The 68-year-old BBC veteran made the revelation while discussing his biggest regrets in life with campmates . The BBC journalist  said he wished he had pushed the former children’s’ TV presenter into the sea when he had an opportunity. He said he could have tipped Saville over the rail of the Queen Elizabeth 2 (file picture) During Wednesday night’s episode of the ITV show, he told his fellow contestants: ‘My other regret is standing at the rail of the QE2 with Jimmy Saville who I personally disliked intensely before everyone else did, and my regret is not tipping him over the rail while I had the chance.' It came after he revealed that his main regret in life was not asking his mother about his bigamist father before she died when he was a teenager. He also spoke movingly about finally meeting his father, who was dying of cancer, and ‘feeling nothing’. The father of two, who has been married to his wife Christine for more than 45 years, told the other contestants: ‘I’ve only one regret in my life and it was losing my mother before I was old enough to have a grown-up conversation with her. ‘My father was a bigamist and I didn’t really know very much about him, and if she had lived a few more years I would have learned a great deal more.’ His mother Betty, who had raised him by herself from the time he was three, died when he was 16, her heart having been weakened by scarlet fever in her childhood. He added: ‘It was a complicated situation really. He was a Canadian army officer during the Second World War and he met my mother towards the end of the war and they obviously had a big thing and he married her and I was born, but he neglected to point out he was already married and had a wife back in Vancouver. Buerk also revealed that his other main regret in life was not asking his mother about his bigamist father before she died when he was a teenager. He also spoke movingly about finally meeting his dying father . The newsreader told contestants: ‘My father was a bigamist and I didn’t really know very much about him' It came amid fears he could become the third person to quit the jungle after complaining of severe hunger . ‘He did divorce his first wife and then we lived in Vancouver until I was three and then, unsurprisingly given that kind of start, something happened, and this is the part I regret, I don’t know what happened and my first memory is coming back on a ship with my mother in 1949.’ The journalist revealed in his 2004 memoirs how his mother had been deceived by his father Gordon when the pair met at a Christmas dance in 1944. The Canadian soldier had spent the war teaching map reading but convinced Betty that he was a war hero with both money and glory to his name. Buerk told his campmates about his father, Canadian solder Gordon Carl Buerk (pictured), and his relationship with him and his mother Betty . He also told her his wife Helen had died – when in reality, Helen was alive and well in Canada. The couple were married four months later. The truth came out only when Gordon returned to Vancouver to be demobbed from the army and Betty found a letter marked ‘From Mrs Gordon Charles Buerk’. Helen agreed not to press charges and instead to divorce him on grounds of infidelity. He then married Betty for a second time. However, the marriage broke down in 1949 and three-year-old Michael and his mother returned to England. Decades later, Buerk sought out his ‘old and sick’ father, finally confronting him in Canada in 1972. He told his campmates: ‘I got married quite young and we went to Vancouver and I rang him up and he was terribly shocked and didn’t want to see me at all so I turned up on the doorstep and had two hours with him. ‘Bad decision I think. Because I felt nothing. It was all heavy stuff.’ The BBC veteran’s emotional admissions came amid growing concerns for his welfare. Looking increasingly gaunt, the broadcaster has confessed he is finding the hunger and stresses of the jungle difficult to cope with, fuelling speculation he may become the third contestant to pull out of the I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! Jungle this year. Looked tired and strained, he recently complained about the hunger and moaned: 'I would give my right arm, my left arm, maybe both legs [for food]. 'I'm not quite sure how much further I would go but at this moment that is what I have in my mind. 'I'd dearly love a dish of pasta and a glass of white wine.' Buerk's wife Christine, who he has been married to for more than 45 years, has flown out to Australia . There are concerns for BBC veteran as he continues to display a rather gaunt frame in the I'm a Celeb jungle . It came after TOWIE star Gemma Collins quit the jungle after just three days after complaining about feeling starved and worrying about contracting malaria. Actor Craig Charles became the second person to leave the show and return to the UK, after being given the news that his brother Dean had suffered a fatal heart attack.

"Betrayal: Lyndsay Murphy, 33, has been jailed for eight months for stealing from the 93-year-old . A carer 'totally betrayed' a 93-year-old dementia sufferer by drawing thousands from her bank account and setting it aside to pay for a gardener and milk. Lyndsay Murphy has been jailed for eight months over the scam, which was only rumbled by the vulnerable pensioner's family after she had stolen £2,600. Her elderly victim's health deteriorated after her bank balance plummeted and she is now confined to a care home, Liverpool Crown Court heard. Today the victim's son said she was 'ashamed' at the theft that tore her life apart. He told the court in a victim impact statement: 'Our family feels totally betrayed by Lyndsay Murphy as we trusted her to care for our mother. 'At a time in her life when she deserved to be treated with dignity and respect because of her age and vulnerability, she has found herself having to deal with a stressful situation. 'She was ashamed she was taken advantage of by someone she liked and trusted.' Murphy, 33, visited the victim three times a week between August 2013 and January last year as part of her job with the agency Community Caring, the court heard. On nine occasions she withdrew £200 to £500 from the pensioner's account at a bank branch in Eastham, Merseyside - putting aside the money to pay for milk and a gardener. Her scam was only rumbled when the pensioner's son noticed her bank balance had dropped despite only he, his brother and sister-in-law having access to her cards. The family retrieved statements which showed each withdrawal corresponded to a day when Murphy was meant to be caring for her. Murphy was suspended by the agency and police traced her to the scene using the bank's CCTV. Murphy, who has no previous convictions, voluntarily handed herself to police in March, denying the theft and claiming that she had withdrawn the money for the victim. Tears: Murphy wept in the dock as she was jailed today at Liverpool Crown Court . She was later arrested at her home following further enquiries, telling police 'I don't know what you're talking about' as she was cautioned. Murphy wept in the dock after she admitted theft. Ben Jones, defending, said she could lose her home and her 14-year-old daughter, who may have to be placed in care while she serves her sentence. Judge Denis Watson, QC, said: 'This was a significant and repeated abuse of trust. She was an extremely vulnerable victim. 'The effect on her is in reality incalculable because as her health diminished, the confidence she had in anyone to care for her, knowing she had been taken advantage of, was completely destroyed. 'I have no doubt at all that her ability to trust strangers never returned.'","Lyndsay Murphy, 33, visited victim three times a week for five months .

"Fur is flying at Crufts, with some owners complaining that too many foreign dogs have been allowed in. This year, Britain's biggest dog show has 3,000 entrants from abroad. Their numbers have been growing since 2001, when legal changes meant pets no longer had to spend six months in quarantine to enter the UK. But the influx has prompted complaints from owners, who say Crufts is a British event. Others claim foreign rivals have an unfair advantage because they have more experience using hairspray and cosmetic products on dogs – Crufts has only allowed such 'performance enhancers' since 2013. World beating: Fur is flying at Crufts, with some owners complaining that too many foreign dogs now compete. Some claims foreign rivals have an unfair advantage because they have more experience using hairspray . In 2009 there were 1,100 foreign dogs at Crufts, but this year 2,995 have registered from 45 countries. There are 631 French dogs, 530 from Italy and 513 Germans. And the competition is gaining an increasingly international flavour with 67 entrants from the United States and four from South Korea, whilst Thailand and Brazil each have two. However, those figures are still dwarfed by the 18,432 British entrants. Since the quarantine laws were changed in 2001, in some cases foreigners have trotted off with the top prize. Best in Show winners include poodle Topscore Contradiction in 2002, from Norway, Australian Shepherd Caitland Isle Take A Chance in 2006 from the USA and in 2009 Sealyham Terrier Efbe's Hidalgo At Goodspice, also from America. Caroline Kisko of the Kennel Club, which runs Crufts, said: 'There has been a gradual build in the number of overseas dogs since changes to the quarantine laws in 2001. 'The vast majority of people entering know there will be overseas dogs and very much accept the competition.' Elizabeth, best in show 2012: In 2009 there were 1,100 foreign dogs at Crufts, but this year 2,995 have registered from 45 countries. There are 631 French dogs, 530 from Italy and 513 Germans . Ms Kisko has a pack of 18 Siberian Huskies who she continues to compete with in harness, but her dogs won't be attending Crufts this year. 'I have to work and focus on the event', she said. She continued: 'We are very proud to welcome to Crufts those dogs and people who are at the top of their game in their own dog related activity. 'Crufts is an event for everybody and there is so much entertainment and information for all dog lovers, helping to inspire new generations of people to take part in activities with their dogs.' The show has truly been a British institution since its inception in 1891 where three of Queen Victoria's dogs won prizes. The increase in overseas dogs competing is expected to benefit the event, increasing the strength of the competition and raising the status of Crufts on an international s scale. Crufts will be at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham from March 5-8.","Some say foreigners benefit from more experience using hairspray .

"A 21-year-old former private school girl, who police claim had descended into a life of drugs and crime, has been charged over the attempted murder of a man who was killed two months later in a brutal attack at his home.

Michael 'Mullet Mick' Martin survived the alleged hit on his life but was killed two months later in a brutal attack at his home . The 46-year-old was murdered in a second attack, thought to involve an axe, in his modest flat in northern NSW last June. He was killed on the night he arrived home after spending a lengthy stint in hospital recovering from the alleged bungled hit on his life in April. Fallon was charged with attempted murder and assault occasioning grievous bodily harm on Tuesday. Police have ruled out her involvement in Mr Martin's murder in the separate home invasion last June and have yet to make any arrest in the case.

"Jared Simpson has learned first-hand what it means to be between a rock and a hard place when he landed behind bars for allegedly trying to pay his bar tab with a pebble – and then threatening to blow up the bar. Simpson, 23, of North Waterford, Maine, was taken into custody in Tallahassee February 18 on charges of making false bomb threats, petty theft and disorderly conduct. According to investigators, the bizarre incident unfolded at around 4pm last Wednesday when Simpson tottered into the bar on crutches, ordered a Bud Light beer and then offered the bartender a rock to cover his $10 tab. 'Rainbow man': Jared Simpson, 23, a Maine resident and a self-proclaimed 'Rainbow Man,' has been arrested for allegedly threatening to blow up a Florida bar after trying to pay his $10 tab with a rock . Simpson walked into 4th Quarter Bar and Grille in Tallahassee Wednesday afternoon on crutches, telling a fellow patron he was 'shot up in the war.' He later left and then returned carrying a suspicious briefcase . When the staffer rejected the pebble as an acceptable method of payment, the 23-year-old Mainer tossed a torn dollar bill at a female employee and said he would pay her 'in other ways,' according to a probable cause affidavit cited by the Huffington Post. In the course of his stay at the Monroe Street bar, Mr Simpson reportedly boasted to another patron, that he was 'shot up in the war.' But when his new acquaintance, who turned out to be a veteran, inquired which military branch he had served in, the 23-year-old replied, 'if I tell you, I have to kill you,' the court documents stated. After Simpson's rock-for-beer barter failed, the suspect allegedly left the bar without the aid of crutches, and then returned carrying a credit card that did not work. Simpson then left the bar again, only to return later dressed in a grey suit and carrying a briefcase. One eyewitness later told police he overheard Simpson ‘speaking in tongues.’ The situation took an unexpected turn when Jared Simpson placed his briefcase on a booth table, opened it, then closed and locked it before backing away from the bag while holding a cellphone and a beeper in his hands. The 23-year-old man warned everyone in the bar, 'Anyone touch this, they will die,' according to the affidavit. Fearing that the briefcase contained an explosive device, bar staff and patrons immediately fled the premises. Once outside, Simpson was observed doing a handstand near El Jalisco’s Mexican Restaurant on North Monroe Street. Bizarre behavior: The 23-year-old landscaper was overheard 'speaking in tongues' and singing a song to a police officer about how he was a 'rainbow man' A police officer who responded to the scene approached Simpson and asked him what was inside the briefcase left in the bar. According to the affidavit, Simpson replied with a smile, 'maybe a bomb or a baby.' He then broke into an improvised song about how he was a 'rainbow man' and how he will not comply with law enforcement’s requests. In response to the officer's repeated questions about the bag, the 23-year-old suspect stated: 'I am my own master, I answer to myself; no police have the right to ask questions.' A bomb squad that was called to the scene examined Simpson's briefcase and vehicle, and determined that neither contained explosives. Once Simpson was placed in the back of a patrol car to be transported to jail, he managed to remove three screws from his handcuffs and free his arms from behind his back. According to his Facebook page, Simpson, who goes by the nickname 'The Geek', studied computer IT at Central Maine Community College and has been working in landscaping and snow removal. Over the past week, Simpson has unleashed a torrent of bizarre posts on his wall about his misadventures in Alabama and Tallahassee, interspersed with desperate pleas for cash after claiming his car and phone had been stolen. Unsettling: When asked by an officer what was inside the briefcase left in the bar, Simpson (left and right) replied with a smile, 'maybe a bomb or a baby.' A bomb squad found nothing suspicious inside the bag . Simpson shared with his friends how one time he snuck into a Best Western to use a computer, how he performed an impromptu duet with a piano player at an exclusive Florida hotel, and how he celebrated Valentine’s Day by having sex with a girl he met at Wendy's after he bought her a frosty. When asked by one of his concerned friends what he was on, Simpson replied: 'drugs...and hugs.' Simpson reportedly said he arrived in Tallahassee to party with the 'Rainbow People' in the Apalachicola National Forest, reported Tallahassee.com. The 23-year-old also ranted on his social media account about police officers, repeatedly referring to them as ‘pigs.’ Simpson’s bond has been set at $30,500, but the station WCTV reported that a judge has ordered the Maine resident to undergo a psychiatric evaluation before he is eligible to bail out.","Jared Simpson, 23, from Maine, charged with making false bomb threats, petty theft and disorderly conduct .

"A 50ft inflatable whale model was today banned from the Royal Parks because it is ‘too religious’. The Bible Society organisation wanted to hold a children’s fun day at Hyde Park and Greenwich Park in London - and use the huge exhibit to help tell the Old Testament story of Jonah and the Whale. But park officials insisted they do not allow ‘events of a religious nature’ - despite the locations being owned by the Queen, who is the Church of England Supreme Governor and Bible Society patron. Prohibited: The 50ft inflatable whale model was banned from the Royal Parks because it is 'too religious' Alternative uses: The giant whale is also used for pirate shows by another group, as seen in this photograph . Not allowed: The Bible Society organisation wanted to hold a children’s fun day at Hyde Park (left) and Greenwich Park (right) in London - and use the whale to help tell the story of Jonah and the Whale . Only six weeks ago the society, which . exists to encourage Bible reading rather than as an evangelical group, . was also banned from installing the life-sized PVC whale near Tower . Bridge in central London. On that occasion the Daily Telegraph reported . that the management firm of Potters Fields claimed that under the terms . of its lease it was ‘not allowed to have any events of a religious . nature’. James . Catford, chief executive of the Bible Society, said today: ‘Our mission is . about inviting everyone to experience Scripture and consider it . thoughtfully - we offer the Bible to the world. ‘Telling . the story of Jonah to children, inside a giant inflatable whale, is . intended to be a free, fun event over the summer. The Bible is packed . full with some of the greatest stories ever told. ‘We believe that every child is . entitled to encounter the Bible. It's a matter of justice. We're not . about proselytising. Children and adults are free to make up their own . minds about the Bible. Monarch: Park officials insisted they do not allow 'events of a religious nature' - despite the locations being owned by the Queen (pictured), who is the Church of England Supreme Governor and Bible Society patron . Bible story: A fresco painting of Jonah and the Whale from the 15th century, near Ayvalik in Turkey . 'We can't see any reasonable basis for Royal Parks to discriminate against us in this way.’ The story of Jonah and the Whale sees Jonah refuse God's command that he preach repentance to the city of Nineveh, before trying to 'run away' by getting onboard a ship. However, God sends a violent storm and Jonah is thrown into the sea before being swallowed by a whale. He stays in its belly for three days before being vomited onto dry land. He then goes to Nineveh and warns the residents to confess their evil actions to God, or he will destroy their nation. They believed Jonah and God forgave them, saving them from destruction. But a Royal Parks spokesman said today: ‘We do . not permit collective acts of worship or other religious observances in the Royal Parks, including the construction of structures with a . religious significance. ‘We seek to strike a balance between the quiet relaxation that the parks provide and events which appeal to a wide audience.’ Officials told the Bible Society that they ‘do not permit collective acts of worship or other religious observances in the Royal Parks, either in their own right or as part of a demonstration’. However, they added that exceptions are made each year for annual acts of remembrance at the regimental memorials in the parks, which have taken place since the First World War. It . comes only five weeks after Prime Minister David Cameron caused . controversy by claiming Britain was a ‘Christian country’ and that . believers should be 'more evangelical' about their faith.","Bible Society organisation wanted to hold children’s fun day in London .

"America's favorite TV home has been revealed as the humble California apartment shared by fictional characters Sheldon, Leonard and Penny on CBS hit series The Big Bang Theory. When it came to choosing their fictional homes, Americans opted for the modest two bedroom abode's open floor plan over Monica Geller’s iconic Manhattan apartment on the sitcom Friends, the Dunphy family's Craftsman home on ABC's Modern Family and Jerry Seinfeld's laid-black New York City apartment for the country's most beloved dream home, according to research. 'It's fascinating how people are inspired to live in the kinds of homes they see on TV, especially when you consider that in reality they are normally just television sets,' real estate agent David Guzman said of the survey. 'But layout, creative lighting and decor can add real appeal to any property.' Scroll down for video .

Unlikely friends: Penny and Amy (Mayim Bialik) hang out inside Penny's colorful apartment on The Big Bang Theory . Mr Guzman, who is an agent at Douglas Elliman Real Estate in New York City, conducted a survey of 1,000 adults to find the top ten beloved homes in television. While the homes from The Big Bang Theory, Modern Family and Seinfeld occupied the first three spots, Monica's apartment on Friends, The Simpsons’ family home and the Miami bachelorette pad seen on the Golden Girls were also among the spaces featured on the list.

According to the new research, almost a quarter or 23per cent of buyers have looked for an apartment or home that looks like their TV dream home - and one in five claimed to have bought one. But most Americans woefully underestimate the value of what they see on TV.

"A Massachusetts Institute of Technology health economist who made national headlines last year for talking about 'the stupidity of the American voter' was a target Monday in a report from the Vermont state auditor saying the economist may have padded his bills to the state. Auditor of Accounts Douglas Hoffer said he referred his findings on Jonathan Gruber and his contract with the state to Attorney General William Sorrell. Hoffer said Gruber's invoices billed Vermont $100 per hour for the work of a research assistant – 1,000 hours in 10 weeks. 'To do so, the RA would have worked exclusively on this project for more than 14 hours per day – every day,' the auditor said. If the assistant worked Monday through Friday, it would amount to 20 hours per day, with just four hours left over to eat and sleep. MIT professor Jonathan Gruber helped draft the Affordable Care Act and had the ear of every Democrat in Washington before it emerged that he had credited 'the stupidity of the American voter' for the law's passage . BIG BUCKS: Four U.S. states and the federal government have padded Gruber's wallet to the tune of $5.9 million since 2000, including millions connected to his work on Obamacare . SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . 'The evidence suggests that Dr. Gruber overstated the hours worked by the RA and that the Agency of Administration ignored the obvious signs that something was amiss.' The attorney general said in an interview that Hoffer raised 'serious questions.' Gruber said in an email Monday to the Associated Press that he did not wish to comment. The MIT economist got $392,600 from the Department of Health and Human Services for his Obamacare consulting, records show. The National Institutes of Health paid him another $2 million for Medicare consulting, and the Justice Department has compensated him to the tune of $1.7 million for 'expert witness testimony.' Four US states, including Vermont, contracted with him for another $1.6 million in consuting work for advice about health care laws. An adviser to the Obama administration on the federal Affordable Care Act, Gruber told groups in 2012 and 2013 that voter stupidity and a 'lack of transparency' were important to passing the hard-fought legislation. He has apologized repeatedly for his comments, saying they were uninformed, 'glib, thoughtless and sometimes downright insulting.' Vermont Administration Secretary Justin Johnson said Monday the two state officials working with Gruber, Robin Lunge and Michael Costa, were in contact with him frequently enough – sometimes multiple times a day – to monitor his work. Still, Johnson said he is urging staff to step up contract vigilance, and he agreed with Hoffer's criticism that Gruber's invoices need more detail. He said state officials had assumed Gruber had multiple assistants working with him, but later learned there was just one. 'We feel that the work was done, but clearly it would have been better if we had documented that and they had documented that,' Johnson said. Hoffer said the round numbers in Gruber's invoices were a red flag. RED FLAGS: Billing for a research assistant to work 1,000 hours over 10 weeks – an exact number that seemed unrealistic and also 'rounded' – got Gruber in trouble . 'It is noteworthy that Dr. Gruber's first invoice reported round numbers of hours worked (100 for Mr. Gruber and 500 for the research assistants),' Hoffer wrote. 'This is possible, but unlikely.
