"Italian police are set for their first-ever nationwide strike in response to 'mudslinging' by authorities after more than 80 per cent of officers in Rome called in sick on New Year's Eve. Members of police union Ospol-CSA - which represents nearly 60,000 officers in 8,000 Italian municipalities will walk out for 24 hours and stage a rally in Rome in solidarity with their colleagues on February 12. The strike was called after politicians, including Rome's mayor and Italy's prime minister, rebuked the force over a mass sickie pulled by 83.5 per cent officers slated to be patrolling the streets on New Year's Eve. Industrial action: A traffic policeman in Rome. Italian police are set for a nationwide strike in solidarity with their colleagues in the capital after political criticism over a mass sickie pulled by Roman traffic police . Francesco Garofalo, director general of Ospol-CSA, said politicians had 'unleashed a defamatory mudslide' against Rome's police,' the Telegraph reported. 'The straw that broke the camel is the infamous avalanche of mud against the body of the Local Police of Rome Capital launched by the institutions, and the City Government,' said Ospol-CSA in a statement. 'The strike is motivated by the continuation of a dispute over ten years, always evaded by governments that have followed, who belittled the role and functions of men and women in uniform of the Local Police.' Striking officers will gather in the centre of Rome on February 12 and march two miles from the Piazza della Repubblica to the Piazza SS Apostoli. On New Year's Eve, when 130,000 revellers flocked to a free outdoor concert in Rome, most police called in sick. A remarkable 10 per cent of them claimed they were unable to come to work because they were donating blood. Of the 1,000 officers on the rota to work that night, only 165 officers turned up, according to the government. Around 30 have since been found to have no justification for their absence and are facing disciplinary action. Dignity at work: Members of police union Ospol-CSA - which represents nearly 60,000 officers in 8,000 Italian municipalities - will on February 12 walk out for 24 hours and stage a rally in Rome . Mayor Ignazio Marino claimed the stay-at-homes were protesting his new policy to give raises only to harder workers. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi rebuked the force and called for a shake-up of public sector employment. 'I read that 83 per cent of police did not work 'because of illness' on December 31. This is why we will change the rules of public sector employment in 2015,' the prime minister wrote in a tweet at the time. The absences meant the Italian capital was badly underpoliced as thousands of drunken revellers surged through its historic piazzas, reportedly letting off powerful fireworks and flares. Ignazio Marino, the mayor of Rome, wrote on Facebook: 'They didn't manage to ruin the party, but those responsible will have to be held to account.' The absences followed a months-long rift between police and the government over changes to salaries and working conditions. The municipal police, known in Italian as 'vigili', denied that they were being lazy, saying their absence was part of a broader dispute over pay, conditions and staffing levelsl.","Nearly 60,000 officers will stage a 24-hour walkout on February 12 .

"Millions of adults suffer from anxiety disorders where their constant worrying affects their daily lives. Now, scientists have identified the area of the brain that controls fear, offering hope of a treatment for such disorders. US researchers have described a ‘circuit’ that controls fearful memories and behaviour in the brains of mice, offering insight into how anxiety disorders may develop. US researchers have described a ‘circuit’ that controls fearful memories and behaviour. They found that PVT plays a role in learning and remembering fear, and that its neurons extend into the central amygdala (all marked on the diagram). Disrupting the connection significantly impaired fear learning in mice . Associate professor Bo Li, who led the study at Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory (CSHL) in New York, said: ‘In our previous work, we discovered that fear learning and memory are orchestrated by neurons in the central amygdala.’ It is thought it could be controlled by a cluster of neurons that form the PVT, or paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus. This region of the brain is extremely sensitive to stress, acting as a sensor for both psychological and physical tension. The researchers were interested in whether PVT plays a role in learning and remembering fear in mice. The finding could potentially help millions of adults suffering from anxiety disorders (stock image) Professor Li said: ‘We found that the PVT is specifically activated as animals learn to fear or as they recall fear memories.’ The researchers found that neurons from the PVT extend deep into the central amygdala, and that disrupting the connection significantly impaired fear learning. They believe that because the link between the PVT and the central amygdala is a critical component of fear learning, drugs could be used to target it in a bid to treat anxiety disorders. Building on the finding, the scientists examined data taken from people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to identify chemical messengers that might connect the PVT and central amydala. They focused on a molecule called BDNF that’s been linked with anxiety disorders and is known to play an important role in stimulating the birth of new neurons, as well as new connections between neurons. Previous studies have shown that patients with anxiety disorders have mutations in BDNF, suggesting that it might have a role in fear learning and memory. Using mice, the researchers investigated whether BDNF plays a role in fear and affects the connection between the PVT and central amygdala. They found that the presence of BDNF in the central amygdala activates the brain region’s neurons, causing mice that had not been frightened, to react fearfully. It also caused the formation of long-term fearful memories, they said. Professor Li explained: ‘We established that this is a regulatory circuit that controls fear in mice: BDNF is the chemical messenger that allows the PVT to exert control over the central amygdala.’ He added: ‘Our work provides mechanistic insight into a novel circuit that controls fear in the brain, and provides a target for the future treatment of anxiety disorders.' A chemical compound found in popular curry ingredient turmeric, could help erase bad memories, a study claims . A spice commonly used in curry could help erase bad memories, according to a study. Curcumin, a bright-yellow compound found in the root of the Indian spice turmeric, prevented new fear memories being stored in the brain, and also removed pre-existing fear memories, researchers found. It is hoped that the findings will help develop treatments for people suffering with psychological disorders. Psychologists from The City University of New York trained rats to become scared when they heard a particular sound. Scientists assumed the creatures were frightened when they froze. Hours later, when the same sound was played to the rats, those who had been given ordinary food froze. Yet the rats fed the curcumin-rich diet didn’t freeze, suggesting their fearful memories had been erased. Professor Glenn Schafe, who led the study, said: ‘This suggests that people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and other psychological disorders that are characterised by fearful memories may benefit substantially from a curcumin-enriched diet.’","Researchers at Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory, New York, have described a ‘circuit’ that controls fearful memories  in the brains of mice .

"Pizza is the second-highest source of calories for kids ages 2 to 18, researchers have found. They say America's love of pizza has meant about 20 percent of youths eat pizza on any given day. They say the food must be curbed, and made healthier. Because it is eaten so frequently - its nutrient content should be improved, say the researchers . On days when children ate pizza, they took in an additional 84 calories, 3 grams of saturated fat, and 134 milligrams of sodium than they did on no-pizza days. Adolescents took in an extra 230 calories, 5 grams of saturated fat and 484 milligrams of sodium. In 2009-2010, on days pizza was eaten, it made up 22 percent of total caloric intake among children and 26 percent of total caloric intake in adolescents. On days they eat pizza, children and adolescents take in significantly more calories, fat and sodium than on days they don't, the  new study has shown. Because it is eaten so frequently - its nutrient content should be improved, say the researchers, whose report is published in the journal Pediatrics. 'Curbing pizza consumption alone isn't enough to significantly reduce the adverse dietary effects of pizza,' says lead author Lisa Powell, associate director of the Health Policy Center at the Institute of Health Research and Policy at the University of Illinois at Chicago. 'It's a very common and convenient food, so improving the nutritional content of pizza, in addition to reducing the amount of pizza eaten, could help lessen its negative nutritional impact.' Kids should not eat more than one or two slices of pizza for a meal, and should pair that with salad, rather than with another high-calorie food, the researchers concluded . The researchers examined dietary recall data from youths ages 2-19 who were participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 2003 and 2010. They found that caloric intake from pizza among children ages 2-11 dropped 25 percent between 2003 and 2010. Among adolescents who ate pizza, calories from pizza fell, although the prevalence of pizza consumption increased slightly for this age group. 'Children and adolescents do not adequately compensate by eating less of other foods on days when they eat pizza,' said Powell, who is professor of health policy and administration in the UIC School of Public Health. For adolescents, the additional fat and sodium intake on days that pizza is eaten represents 24 percent and 21 percent, respectively, of the recommended daily values for those nutrients, she said. Pizza had the largest impact on diet when eaten as a snack between meals. Children took in an additional 202 calories, and adolescents an extra 365 calories, on days they ate pizza as a snack compared to days they did not. For adolescents, the additional fat and sodium intake on days that pizza is eaten represents 24 percent and 21 percent, respectively, of the recommended daily values for those nutrients . The researchers also looked at where and when pizza was eaten. They found that from 2003 to 2010, calories from pizza at dinner fell, but pizza consumption at lunch and from school cafeterias did not change. However, overall caloric intake was similar on days when pizza from school cafeterias was and wasn't eaten, possibly because non-pizza lunch offerings were similarly high in calories, Powell said. Pizza's contribution to excess calories was generally consistent across race, gender and income, except it was significantly higher among African American children as compared to Hispanic children. 'Because when pizza is consumed, it increases the total daily calories that children and adolescents take in, it could be an important contributor to the obesity epidemic,' says study co-author Dr. William Dietz, director of the Sumner M. Redstone Global Center for Prevention and Wellness at the Milken Institute School of Public Health at the George Washington University. 'Moderating pizza consumption should become another goal in our efforts to reduce obesity in U.S. youth.' The authors also suggest that because of its prevalence and impact on diet, pizza should be addressed specifically in nutritional counseling.","20 percent of youths in the US eat pizza on any given day .

"A jury has seen a video of two Vanderbilt University football players giggling while assaulting a woman with a water bottle, a court heard. Brandon Vandenburg, 21, and Cory Batey, 20, are accused of assaulting the 21-year-old unconscious woman in a dorm room in June 2013. Two other football players are also accused in the case: 20-year-olds Brandon Banks and Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie. On Monday, Metro Police Detective Chad Gish told the court footage obtained from Vandenburg's friend shows Vandenburg and Banks assaulting the victim and giggling. Accused: New footage allegedly shows Brandon Vandenburg (left during trial on Monday) giggling and pushing on the victim so hard he left a mark as Brandon Banks (right) assaulted the woman with a water bottle . Testimony: Detective Chad Gish told the court a the video showed the 21-year-old woman to be unconscious . Vandenburg pressed his hand down so hard on the woman that he left a mark, Gish said. Showing the video to the jurors, he identified Vandenburg 'giggling' and saying 'squeeze that [expletive], squeeze that [expletive]' as Banks assaulted the woman with a water bottle, The Tennessean reported. Vandenburg is standing trial with Batey, as neither of them agreed to a plea bargain. Banks and McKenzie made a deal which will likely see them testify against their co-accused. The building's surveillance footage, which was discovered when officials were looking into vandalism, prompted the rape investigation. Last week, Vanderbilt police Lieutenant Donnie Harville testified on Thursday that the video showed a male student walking naked out of a bathroom in the coed dorm. It also appeared that no one called police to report concern for the woman, even though the video showed two female students nearby when she was carried inside Gillette House around 2.30 a.m. 'To your knowledge, did she contact anyone out of concern?' defense attorney Worrick Robinson said. 'To my knowledge, no,' Harville said. The footage did not show any bystanders around when the woman was dragged out of the elevator. Defense attorneys say the video portrays a culture of binge drinking and promiscuous sex that their clients were caught up in. Trial: Defendant Brandon Vandenburg, left, and Cory Batey, right, listen with attorney Fletcher Long, center during their trial for sexually assaulting a fellow student on Thursday. Their co-accused have yet to stand . Vandenburg and Batey are the only two suspects who did not strike a plea deal with with prosecutors and plead guilty. The other two defendants are slated to testify against them . On trial: Pictured in court on Wednesday, Brandon Vandenburg, left, and Cory Batey, right, are accused of raping a 21-year-old unconscious woman in a dorm room at Vanderbilt in June 2013 . Lieutenant Donnie Harville of the Vanderbilt Police Department testified about the surveillance footage and said that Vandenburg placed a towel over a campus surveillance camera on the morning of the incident . The defense also appears to be trying to convince jurors that no one would have been concerned for the woman because it was commonplace to see students drunk. Prosecutors accuse the players of laughing, taking photos and videos while the incapacitated woman was being violated in a dorm room. One is accused of inserting something in her while another egged him on. Another player is said to have had sex with her and urinating on her. On Wednesday, Harville also testified that Vandenburg placed a towel over a campus surveillance camera on the morning of the incident. The footage shows the woman lying on the floor of a dorm hallway and being photographed in a compromising position, prosecutors said. Defense attorneys have said Vandenburg and Batey were drunk despite not being old enough to drink. Vandenburg, a star player who had recently transferred to Vanderbilt from College of the Desert in California, took the student to a bar called Tin Roof for a date on the night of the alleged attack. On the ride back, she reportedly passed out in the car and he drove to the dorm, where he ran into the other players. During the opening statements, the alleged victim, an Oklahoma native, sat in the audience wiping her eyes with a tissue. She is expected to take the stand as a witness for the prosecution. Star witnesses: Fellow football player Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie has also been charged in the rape case but is expected to testify against Vandenburg and Batey . Accused: Vandenburg (left) had been on a date with the woman the night she says she was attacked. On the way back, she passed out and Vandenburg took her to the dorm where he saw Batey (right) and the others . Crime scene: Prosecutors say Vandenburg brought his unconscious date to his second-floor room in the Gillette House dormitory, where the men egged each other on and proceeded to rape the young woman . Vandenburg and Batey are being tried on five counts of aggravated rape and two counts of aggravated sexual battery. Vandenburg is also charged with one count of tampering with evidence and one count of unlawful photography. The two ex-players not on trial but also charged in the case, Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie and Brandon Banks, are expected to testify against Vandenburg and Batey. All have pleaded not guilty. The trial comes in the midst of a debate about the prevalence of rapes on America's college campuses. The Obama administration has launched a campaign to end sexual assault on university campuses. Officials at Vanderbilt University did not immediately respond to a call seeking comment.","Jury allegedly watched video showing Brandon Vandenburg, 21, 'giggling as Brandon Banks, 20, assaulted victim, 21, with a water bottle'

"A mother under investigation for letting her two young children walk a mile home from the park by themselves has spoken out to publicly defend 'free-range parenting'. Danielle Meitiv appeared on the Today show Monday morning with her children Rafi, 10, and Dvora, six. Just before Christmas, the two children were walking about a mile home from a park near their Maryland home when police officers stopped them and asked why they were alone. The officers escorted the Meitiv children home, launching a Child Protective Services investigation into Danielle and her husband Alexander's competence as parents. But Mrs Meitiv doesn't think she they did anything wrong in giving her children a little independence. Scroll down for video . What's wrong? Danielle Meitiv (right) appeared on the Today show on Monday with her 10-year-old son Rafi (center) and 6-year-old daughter Dvora about a month after Child Protective Services launched an investigation because she let the two walk home from a park alone . Walking home alone: Rafi said his parents let him take short walks alone or with his sister in a practice known as 'free-range parenting' 'We're just doing what our parents did. It was considered perfectly normal just one generation ago,' she said on Today. Free-range parenting is the name given to a style of raising kids in opposition to so-called 'helicopter parenting'. 'Helicopter parents' are named for their habit of hovering over their offspring, micro-managing their lives in an attempt to keep them safe. However critics believe this creates under-confident, over-reliant children, while also causing the parents stress. Free-range parents advocate a more hands-off approach, where children are allowed to go out and experience the world on their own. Instead of constantly monitoring activities to make sure children are safe, the emphasis is put on adults assessing risk ahead of time, and equipping children with the skills to deal with danger themselves. Mrs Meitiv admits that the walk back from the park was longer than her two kids had taken before, but says she wasn't worried because they have been on several shorter walks together with no issues. 'Well I've walked home from school before. Not with my sister, but I've done it alone,' 10-year-old Rafi said. 'We walked around the block a lot and we walk home from another park which is just around the block. The Meitivs describe themselves as 'free-range parents' who encourage their two children to take journeys without supervision in order to build confidence and teach them about the outside world. Usually they have the kids carry around a card that reads 'I'm not lost. I'm a free range kid' but they left them behind that day when they went to the park that was a bit further away from their house. Someone saw the two kids walking alone and called 911, and about three police officers stopped the children as they were about halfway home. While Mrs Meitiv says her children assured the officers that they knew where they were going, the police escorted them home to talk to her husband, Alexander Meitiv. Mrs Meitiv wasn't home at the time, but says the officers were aggressive to her husband, and that her son called her crying, fearing that he would be arrested. 'He was shocked. He sees three police officers with our kids. And they didn't really explain what was going on so it was kind of uncomfortable. They asked for ID. He said he felt they were really aggressive,' she said. Journey: On December 20, the brother and sister were walking about a mile home from this park when a citizen called 911 after seeing the two without their parents . When Child Protective Services later showed up at the house, she says they threatened her husband if he didn't sign a form, promising to supervise his children at all times until a follow up appointment. 'He said I don't want to sign this without talking to a lawyer or talking to my wife. And she said if you don't sign this we're going to take the children right now and she called the police,' she said. The Meitivs are still under investigation by CPS. Mrs Meitiv says she understands why other parents wouldn't let their children walk alone, but doesn't believe her decision to give her children more freedom makes her a bad mother. 'I think what's really unfortunate is we're really overestimating the danger and underestimating our children. 'And in fact what's really sad is that by driving our kids instead of letting them walk, we're actually endangering them more because the number one cause of death for children this age are actually car accidents. 'So letting children walk is not only good for their health, it's actually safer than driving.' Parenting choice: Mrs Meitiv (pictured) says she and husband Alexander often let their children Rafi, ten, and Dvora, six, walk alone to teach them about the world . Play time: Danielle (left) and Alex Meitiv (right) pictured with their two children at the park . The Meitiv children pictured outside the National Gallery in Washington, DC this month . Alex and Danielle have yet to learn whether any further action will be taken against them, but say whatever happens next, the experience has left them furious. Mrs Meitiv previously told the Washington Post: 'I think what CPS considered neglect, we felt was an essential part of growing up and maturing. 'We feel we’re being bullied into a point of view about child-rearing that we strongly disagree with.' A CPS spokeswoman told the Post that they couldn't comment on individual cases, but pointed to state law which says children under eight must be left with a responsible person aged at least 13. Police said they could not find information on the case, but a spokeswoman said that when concerns are reported, 'we have a responsibility as part of our duty to check on people’s welfare.'","On December 20  police were called after Danielle Meitiv's children were spotted alone, walking about a mile home from the park .

"A multimillionaire property tycoon shot in his Rolls Royce by a cyclist may have been saved by the car's thick windows. British-born philanthropist Kameron Segal, 48, was hit in the face and chest in a parking lot on Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, on Friday night just before leaving work to discuss a $5million business deal. The CEO of Williams Holdings property and acquisitions was sitting behind the wheel of his $300,000 Rolls Royce Wraith at the time and may have escaped death because the bullets hit the denser glass - which are installed to mute exterior sounds. The LAPD are still searching for the man who fled the scene on his bike after firing into the car. His family, including his four-year-old son, are believed to have travelled from the UK to be at his bedside in LA. Mr Segal's friends believe that he may have been the victim of a 'high-priced' hit as nothing was stolen from the car. Closing a deal: Kameron Segal, 48, was about to close a $5 million deal when he was shot on Friday. The thick glass on his $300,000 car may have saved his life . Scene: Segal was shot in the face and chest in a parking lot on Sunset Boulevard before leaving to meet his business partner on Friday night . Motive: Mr Segal's friends believe he may have been the victim of a 'high-price' hit as nothing was stolen from the car. A manhunt for the suspect is still underway . Josh Karp, a salesman at Meltdown Comics, which is just a couple of doors down from the parking lot, said he saw a 'stark naked' man get out of the car covered in bandages. He told the LA Times: 'They quickly took him away. It was surreal.' His friend, Steve Castro told ABC News: 'It seems like there’s something behind it and, hopefully, we can get to the bottom of it.' Possible leads in the case include the unusual circumstances surrounding the lucrative deal he was believed to be on his way to completing. Another friend, Mytchell Mora, said: 'In particular on a Friday night, making that type of investment at 10, 11pm at night; that to me just didn’t sound like Kameron.' Mr Segal was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in critical condition. He is expected to make a full recovery. According to KTLA, witnesses saw the suspect fleeing on a bike after the shots were fired.

Authorities believe he is a black man in his late 30s to early 40s, is said to be around six feet tall and was last seen wearing a baseball cap and carrying a ruck sack. Aerial footage of the scene showed fire engines and patrol cars surrounding the vehicle which has suicide doors - where the hinges are at the rear rather than the front.

"Liberace is heading back to the stage 28 years after his death thanks to some technological tricks. The flamboyant performer, who passed away in 1987, will be projected on stage as a hologram at some point this year - first in Las Vegas and then during a tour across the U.S. It comes after the late Michael Jackson appeared on stage at last year's Billboard Music Awards. In 2012, Tupac also returned to the stage at Coachella Music Festival. Hologram USA - the team behind Tupac's act - are now plotting Liberace's return, and hope that he will be able to interact with members of the audience, Forbes reported. Scroll down for video . Coming to a stage near you: Liberace, who passed away in 1987, is touring the U.S. this year - but it'll be thanks to tricks involving light and glass, which will make him appear on stage as a sort of hologram . Jonathan Warren, the chairman of the Liberace Foundation, said in a statement last year that the audience will 'feel the warmth from his heart, the sparkle of his eye and the pure lightening from his fingertips'. 'In the end, history is to be re-lived, not rewritten, a legend never dies,' he said. The foundation has supplied Hologram USA with footage and artifacts for the full-length show, but it is not yet known when the show will begin or what songs he will perform. 'This is a major step in the evolution of this medium for entertainment,' Hologram USA CEO Alki David said in a statement last year. 'With our partners at the Liberace Foundation we'll be able to stage a show so lifelike - the room will be filled with all of the great singer's charm and charisma.' While the word 'hologram' is used, the shows more typically use reflections on glass with a technique called 'Pepper's Ghost', named after 19th century optics researcher John Pepper. Tricks: Michael Jackson returned to the stage at the Billboard Music Awards last year (pictured) thanks to a similar technique. Two years prior, Tupac was also seen on stage at the Coachella Music Festival . The technique projects an image onto stage by placing a piece of glass between the original image of the performer and the audience. With lighting, the image of the performer is then projected towards the audience. In Tupac's case, the show did not use old footage but was created by CGI, which cost between $100,000 and $400,000, Gizmodo reported. At the Billboard Music Awards last May, the Jackson hologram performed Slave To The Rhythm, which is from his posthumous album Xscape, and it even moonwalked across the stage. The performance, which lasted 14 minutes, had a reported cost of millions. The show went ahead amid legal wrangling after the owner of Hologram USA insisted that his holographic technology was stolen by organizers Pulse Entertainment - which the company denied.","Liberace passed away in 1987 - but 28 years on he is returning to the stage in Las Vegas thanks to some trickery using light and glass .

"A new study, aimed at discovering the positive effects of break-ups, has suggested it takes three months to get over a relationship falling apart. Research published in US magazine, The Journal of Positive Psychology, found that it takes 11 weeks to feel the beneficial effects of a relationship split. This follows previous findings that it could take up to six months to be able to move on. Scroll down for video . New research has suggested that it will take three months - or around eleven weeks - to start seeing the positives of a break up . Gary Lewandowski and Nicole Bizzoco of Monmouth University, New Jersey, questioned 155 people who had been through a break-up in the last six months. They found that 71 per cent of people began to see the positives in the split in just a short period of time. Those who've made it through the initial three months after a break are described as having left 'the recovery zone', a period of painful adjustment and healing. Lewandowski and Bizzoco found that people started to feel better about themselves and developed strong coping strategies beyond the 11 week mark. However, this research may only apply to short term relationships. A different study that questioned how long it would take couples to get over a divorce found the time frame was significantly longer. It takes an average of 18 months to recover from the trauma of divorce, says dating site Fifties.com . Dating site Fifties.com found that it takes an average of 18 months to get over a marriage breakdown, which is six times longer than Lewandowski and Bizzoco's estimate. This may be because a marriage is considered a more serious commitment. Of those questioned by the website one in six said they found it hard to deal with the feelings of failure. And while 43 per cent of people said that they felt a sense of relief when their divorce came through 31 per cent said that they still felt a sense of sadness. If you find yourself suddenly alone, don't despair. Relationship expert and self help guru Dr Pam Spurr gives her tips for healing the heartache... 1. Don't blame yourself . Remind yourself regularly that the relationship ended because your partner had the problem with communicating, which was nothing to do with you. You were willing and able to talk about your problems but your partner couldn't deal with that... which is their loss. 2. Take up something new . It's important that it's completely unrelated to your ex, and even better if it's something they didn't want you to do! So many people who've had these sort of break-ups keep doing the same things they did with their ex, which just increases their pain. Leave those things until much later, when the pain of the break-up has faded. 3. Date for fun . Now's not the time to look for another meaningful relationship. Enjoy your friends, go out with interesting people, but put all thoughts of a replacement relationship out of your mind. 4. Don't be a relationship bore . Spend more time with your friends and family by all means, but try not to keep going over the break-up with them again and again. Much as they love you and want you to be happy, even they can't be expected to stick around if you're constantly going over the same ground. You need your friends, so don't scare them away! 5. Work on your 'I don't care' attitude . Even if you do still deeply care about your ex, with practise this will really help speed up your recovery. Focus on all the annoying things they used to do; try and decide what used to irritate you the most. Soon you'll be amazed to find you really don't care any more.","New study of 155 people published in The Journal of Positive Psychology .

"A new stage show featuring a cast of plus-size performers is challenging society's stereotypical views about what a dancer's body should look like. Nothing to Lose, a boundary-breaking new Australian production by dance company Force Majeure, shatters the perception that a performer must be slim and taut in order to be beautiful. The company's artistic director, Kate Champion, teamed up with filmmaker and fat activist Kelli Jean Drinkwater in order to explore and celebrate the movement of bigger bodies in the show, which will premiere at the Sydney Festival on January 21. Ms Champion said she was inspired to work with a 'full cast of big-bodied dancers' after noticing that her eyes were often drawn to the movements of larger people whenever she was near a dance floor. Scroll down for video . New ideal: Seven plus-size performers proudly shake and grab their skin in Nothing to Lose, a new dance production premiering at the Sydney Festival in Australia on January 21 . Shake it off: Force Majeure's artistic director Kate Champion collaborated with fat activist Kelli Jean Drinkwater to celebrate the movement of bigger bodies for her final show with the dance company . Be different: The show challenges the idea of what a dancer's body is supposed to look like and celebrates the beauty of larger shapes . 'I thought why aren't we seeing that on stage more?' she said in a YouTube video for the Sydney Festival. The choreographer recalled realizing that she 'needed to find someone who lives in the bigger body' in order to move forward with her idea. She later enlisted Ms Drinkwater to ensure the show wouldn't be voyeuristic or exploitative. 'I had no idea the level of abuse that a lot of [the show's dancers] experience daily and how they have to prepare themselves to go out in public all the time,' Ms Champion said. 'That's quite shocking.' Ms Champion, who will be ending her term as Artistic Director of Force Majeure following this show, explained that she wanted to strip away all the judgement that people have 'around fat bodies'. She added that she hopes to create a space where the audience can view the plus-sized dancers in a 'different way and actually just enjoy the physical form moving’. Dancing queen: The choreographer said she was often drawn to the movements of the larger people on the dance floor, and thought: 'Why aren't we seeing that on stage more?' Mean girls: Ms Champion said she was shocked to learn about the level of abuse that many of her plus-size dancers experience daily . Innovative moves: She also noted that the performers were the ones who showed her that they could use their flesh and shape choreographically . The preview video for Nothing to Lose shows the performers shaking their full figures and grabbing their bellies, and Ms Champion noted that the dancers were actually the ones who first showed her the possibilities of using their flesh and their shape choreographically. Ms Drinkwater added that it has been wonderful to see the transformation of the seven core dancers who star in the show. 'The opportunity to be in a dance theater show as a fat person is incredibly rare, so watching that kind of understanding of self and embodiment has been an incredible joy,' she said. To accompany their stage performance, the dancers were also photographed for a series of still shots, which show them twisting and contorting in front of a grey cement wall. The haunting images, which were taken by photographer Tony Burrows, capture the performers graceful movements and defy viewers' preconceived notions of what a 'dancer's body' should look like. Body acceptance: 'The opportunity to be in a dance theater show as a fat person is incredibly rare,' Ms Drinkwater said . Model ready: The dancers were photographed by Tony Burrows as they stretched and contorted their frames in front of a gray cement wall . Ballet beautiful: The plus-size performers prove that you don't need to be model thin in order to create beautiful movements with your body . Flaunt it: The dancers show off their figures in dresses, leotards and lingerie in the series of still shots . 'I do believe that there is a noticeable groundswell in body positivity and fat activism here in Australia, much more than there was ten or even five years ago, and it’s long overdue,' Ms Drinkwater told Concrete Playground. 'And for sure social media is playing a huge part in that by creating access to communities that encourage each other to critique dominant cultural ideas around fatness. 'It’s like this collective tipping point and I think people, regardless of their size, are sick of feeling pressured by a prescribed standard of ‘physical perfection’, whatever that means.' She added: 'I believe audiences are eager to see a broader scope of bodies on stage. 'That’s what is so refreshing about Nothing to Lose.' Bend and snap: The images celebrate the performers' shapes along with their graceful poses . Time for change: 'I believe audiences are eager to see a broader scope of bodies on stage,' Ms Drinkwater explained . Body revolution: Ms Drinkwater believes that the dance show is a sign that society is becoming more understanding about weight and size issues . Nothing to Lose is another example of how body acceptance movements and campaigns have gained popularity over recent years. Last October, radio producer Whitney Way Thore showcased her amazing dance moves in a series of weight acceptance videos titled A Fat Girl Dancing as a part of her No Body Shame Campaign. Thore is now starring in her own TLC reality series, My Big Fat Fabulous Life, which premiered on January 13. And in 2014, a number of women took to social media to share photos of their bikini bodies after plus-size fashion blogger Gabi Gregg posted a picture of herself in a two-piece swimsuit with the hashtag #fatkini. Miss Gregg has since launched two collections of swimwear for women sizes 10 through 24, with the first selling out within 48 hours.","The Australian dance production, Nothing to Lose, will premiere at the Sydney Festival on January 21 .

"Lebanon's Miss Universe contestant has tried to distance herself from a controversial selfie of her with Miss Israel which led to calls for her to be stripped of her title. Saly Greige, 25, has apologised for appearing in the photo and claims Miss Israel, Doron Matalon, 'jumped in' to take the photo before she could get out of the way. Lebanon and Israel are at war, and Miss Greige, from Al-Koura, north Lebanon, claims she had done her best to avoid Miss Matalon at the pageant in Miami. Scroll down for video .

Crowned: Saly Greige waving after being crowned Miss Lebanon 2014, in October last year . Under fire: Since the selfie emerged, there have been several calls for Miss Greige to be stripped of her Miss Lebanon title for 'consorting with the enemy'. There have been several calls for Miss Greige to be stripped of her Miss Lebanon title over the picture, which shows her smiling awkwardly with Miss Matalon, Miss Japan and Miss Slovenia, but she claims it was not her fault. In an apology on Facebook, the beauty queen wrote: 'Since the first day of my arrival to participate to Miss Universe, I was very cautious to avoid being in any photo or communication with Miss Israel (that tried several times to have a photo with me). 'I was having a photo with Miss Japan, Miss Slovenia and myself, suddenly Miss Israel jumped in, took a selfie, and put it on her social media.' The offending photo appeared on Miss Matalon's Instagram account on January 11. Miss Greige, who has a masters degree in civil engineering, can be seen smiling awkwardly in the photograph alongside Miss Japan and Miss Slovenia. Lebanese media picked up the story, running Greige's allegations that Matalon had 'photobombed' the selfie, and local social media users both defended and attacked their beauty queen for the picture. In response to Miss Greige's apology, Miss Matalon said it made her sad that Miss Greige could not 'put the hostility out of the game' Miss Greige, posing with Miss Japan Keiko Tsuji and Miss Finland Krista Haapalainen, apologised for the selfie, claiming Miss Israel has taken the group selfie when she was unprepared .

Miss Matalon responded to the controversy herself on Sunday, saying it made her 'sad'. 'It doesn't surprise me, but it still makes me sad. Too bad you can not put the hostility out of the game,' she wrote in English and Hebrew. Israel occupied parts of Lebanon for 22 years until 2000, but the two countries are still technically at war and their armies occasionally skirmish along the UN-designated withdrawal line. Israel fought a bloody war against Lebanon's Hezbollah in 2006, which killed more than 1,200 people in Lebanon, mostly civilians, and some 160 Israelis, mostly soldiers.","Miss Lebanon Saly Greige forced to apologise for selfie with Miss Israel .

"Earth's earliest primates have taken a step up in the world, now that researchers have gotten a good look at their ankles. A new study has found that Purgatorius, a small mammal that lived on a diet of fruit and insects, was a tree dweller. Paleontologists made the discovery by analyzing 65-million-year-old ankle bones collected from sites in northeastern Montana. A new study has found that Purgatorius, a small mammal that lived on a diet of fruit and insects, was a tree dweller. The identification of Purgatorius ankle bones, found in the same area as the teeth, gave researchers a better sense of how it lived. 'The ankle bones have diagnostic features for mobility that are only present in those of primates and their close relatives today,' Chester said. 'These unique features would have allowed an animal such as Purgatorius to rotate and adjust its feet accordingly to grab branches while moving through trees. Purgatorius, part of an extinct group of primates called plesiadapiforms, first appears in the fossil record shortly after the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs. Some researchers have speculated over the years that primitive plesiadapiforms were terrestrial, and that primates moved into the tree canopy later. These ideas can still be found in some textbooks today. 'The textbook that I am currently using in my biological anthropology courses still has an illustration of Purgatorius walking on the ground,' said Stephen Chester of Brooklyn College, City University of New York. the paper's lead author. 'Hopefully this study will change what students are learning about earliest primate evolution and will place Purgatorius in the trees where it rightfully belongs,' Until now, paleontologists had only the animal's teeth and jaws to examine, which left much of its appearance and behaviour a mystery. The identification of Purgatorius ankle bones, found in the same area as the teeth, gave researchers a better sense of how it lived. 'The ankle bones have diagnostic features for mobility that are only present in those of primates and their close relatives today,' Chester said. 'These unique features would have allowed an animal such as Purgatorius to rotate and adjust its feet accordingly to grab branches while moving through trees. 'In contrast, ground-dwelling mammals lack these features and are better suited for propelling themselves forward in a more restricted, fore-and-aft motion.' The research provides the oldest fossil evidence to date that arboreality played a key role in primate evolution. Previous images of Purgatorius show it on the ground . In essence, said the researchers, it implies that the divergence of primates from other mammals was not a dramatic event. Rather, primates developed subtle changes that made for easier navigation and better access to food in the trees. 'These new fossils support the idea that the first 10 million years of primate evolution happened in the context of an intense period of similar diversification in flowering plants, including the ability to climb in branches and collect fruits and other products of the trees at the very beginning,' the team has said previously. Purgatorius lived during the Paleocene, shortly after the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs. Given the end of the Age of Dinosaurs, the new era began the mammal-dominated era, which we are still in. This mammal is generally believed to have been small and brown, and had a bushy tail. The tiny mammal is generally believed to have been brown and had a bushy tail. It weighed about 1.3 ounces, making it roughly the size of the smallest living primates: the mouse lemurs of Madagascar. Purgatorious had a lot of teeth, including relatively low-crowned molars, which were idea for eating fruit, although it probably ate other things as well. Researchers believe it spent much of its time eating fruit and climbing trees. Remains were originally discovered in what is now eastern Montana's Purgatory Hill (hence the animal's name) in deposits believed to be about 66 million years old. The researchers liken it to another early primate, Dryomomys, for which more fossil material is available. Based on that and the newly found bones, Purgatorius weighed about 1.3 ounces, making it roughly the size of the smallest living primates: the mouse lemurs of Madagascar. The mammal had a lot of teeth, including relatively low-crowned molars, which were specialized for eating fruit, although it probably ate other things too. Tree living served this and other primates well, such that all but a few existing species remain at least partly arboreal. Humans are part of the rare exceptions, since our more recent ancestors left the trees some 60 million years after Purgatorius' lifetime.","Purgatorius was a small mammal that lived on a diet of fruit and insects .

"Most babies' faces light up the moment they see their parents looking at them. But for one mother, the reaction she got when her daughter recognised her face for the first time was one she will never forget. Baby Louise was born with albinism, a condition which affects the amount of melanin in the skin and can also impair vision. Baby Louise, pictured, was born with albinism, a condition which had impaired her vision, and she needed to have glasses fitted . This means that she had been unable to see her mother's face clearly and needed glasses to correct her eyesight. And the heartwarming moment the baby was fitted with her first pair of specs, she was able to see clearly for the first time and looked on in amazement at recognising her mother's face. The fitting was captured on camera and shows Louise's glasses being fitted and adjusted around her face. Her mother then calls her name and claps her hands, and the youngster looks around to see what all of the fuss is about. At first Louise didn't look impressed with her new specs, but after hearing her mother call her name and clap she became excited . Then a big smile breaks out across her face after she recognises her mother and can clearly see her face for the first time ever . But on realising that it is her mother and she can see her face properly for the first time, Louise looks on in shock and a big smile breaks out across her face. The clip, which has already been viewed almost 700,000 times in six days, came with the caption: 'Our sweet Louise who has Albinism, received her glasses! 'This is her reaction from putting them on for the first time. It seems like she is really 'seeing' her mommy for the first time. Love!' Albinism is a genetic condition, which affects the production of melanin affecting the skin, hair and eyes. The lack of pigment in the iris causes sufferers to often have red or grey coloured eyes, but also affects the retina leading to vision problems. It is thought that the condition affects 1 in 17,000 people in the US.","Baby Louise suffers from albinism, a condition which impaired her vision .

"One of Tiger Woods' front teeth was knocked out by a cameraman during a media scramble after his girlfriend Lindsey Vonn won another World Cup event in Italy on Monday. The golfer revealed the gap in his mouth as he congratulated the skier following her winning run in Cortina D'Ampezzo - her 63rd World Cup victory. He had hidden behind a skeleton-covered mask before surprising Vonn but it seems she was not the only one who didn't recognize the former world No. 1 - as the media promptly trampled him.

"One of Britain's richest men has got the green light to build his own railway around his £10million country home and grounds. Billionaire John Caudwell founded mobile giant Phones4u as part of a business empire which was sold for nearly £1.5billion in 2006. The 62-year-old businessman has now been granted planning permission to build a narrow gauge railway around his 50-room Broughton Hall home, near Eccleshall, Staffordshire. Business tycoon John Caudwell is to have his own railway built around his £10million Broughton Hall home . The billionaire made his money in mobile phones, selling a group which included Phones4u in 2006 . The railway line will run through the estate's 28-acre formal gardens and open parkland and will be used to take the tycoon's family and friends round the expansive grounds. The railway, which will echo the design of a similar attraction at nearby Weston Park,  will not be open to the public. The three-mile track will run past the estate's tennis court and indoor swimming pool, through the large gardens and then round the parkland attached to the property. Mr Caudwall's agent said: 'To enhance the enjoyment of the estate Mr Caudwell wishes to construct a light private narrow gauge railway that travels through both the formal gardens and open parkland. 'This is a private residence so it will be for the enjoyment of family and friends only and will not be open to the public.' The application was granted on December 22 and will also include an 18m by 9m shed to protect the train when it is not in use. The building will also provide shelter for 18 cows which graze on the land. Mr Caudwell, a father-of-five, is currently ranked as the 464th richest person in the world, and the 13th wealthiest in the UK. The philanthropist's net worth is estimated to be around £2billion. The railway will take Mr Caudwell and his family around the 28-acre acres of his gardens in Staffordshire . Plans show the track snaking around the wooded grounds, passing Mr Caudwell's tennis court and pool . Mike Hanson, director of Rudyard Lake Steam Railway, Leek, Stafforshire has his own similar railway around his home in Lancashire. He said: 'These little railways are very popular and I'm sure Mr Caudwell will love going round his gardens on a train. 'A lot of millionaires have them built mainly to entertain family and friends on their private land. 'While it might seem a little unusual to some people, projects like this are more popular than people might think.' Eccleshall Parish Council confirmed it had not received any objections to the proposals. Conservative councillor for Eccleshall, Peter Jones, said: 'Mr Caudwell obviously seems to be a bit of a light railway enthusiast. 'Broughton Hall used to be a nunnery so the grounds are quite substantial so this will not affect anybody in Eccleshall. 'It's a private estate so I think it's fine if he wants to build something like this.' Mr Caudwell made millions from the 2006 sale of Phones4u, which then went into administration last year . His planned railway also includes a shed to keep his train in. The structure will also house a herd of cows . Mr Caudwell founded Phones4u in 1996 before selling the business for £1.47 billion in 2006. The company then entered administration in September last year costing around 2,400 jobs. He announced last October that he was separating from his partner, Claire Johnson, 45, who he had been with for 13 years, and with whom he had one child, Jacobi, 10. Another one of Mr Caudwell's sons, Rufus, 19, hit the headlines last year when it emerged that the teenager suffered from agoraphobia. Rufus, along with sisters Libby, 26, and Rebekah, 35, were the children of Mr Caudwell and his ex-wife Kathryn McFarlane. The billionaire also has another child, Scarlett, 12, from a relationship he had with Jane Burgess in 2001. On November 1, 2010 Mr Caudwell was clubbed with an iron bar and his girlfriend Claire Johnson, 45, assaulted by masked robbers who burst into the property. The raiders escaped with hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of cash and jewellery in the raid which left Mr Caudwell with a deep gash to his head. Mr Caudwell is the founder of the Caudwell Children charity, which provides  support, equipment, treatment and therapy for disabled youngsters.

"A man who was targeted by counter-terrorism police as part of an investigation into ISIS has been granted bail, with his lawyer describing the claims as a distraction. Omar Ammouche was taken into custody earlier this month after authorities allegedly found 50 shotgun shells in a cooler bag in the kitchen of his  Greenacre home in Sydney's west. The 33-year-old  man was arrested and was later charged with acquiring and possessing prohibited ammunition without holding a licence. The Central Local Court heard Ammouche was being monitored as part of an investigation following two Australians involved in 'hostile activities' overseas. Scroll down for video . Omar Ammouche was charged after counter terrorism police raided a number of properties early this month . The 33-year-old Greenacre man was arrested when police raided a home on Chiswick Road in Sydney's west . 'We have been monitoring their connections in Australia ... one of them we say is Mr Ammouche,' Detective Sergeant Katherine Weissel, who is attached to the counter-terrorism unit, said in evidence. During the raids, prosecutor David Anderson told the court that police had also uncovered a flag and clothing associated with ISIS, also known as Islamic State or IS, in a car at Ammouche's home on Chiswick Road. He said Ammouche had previously been placed on a good behaviour bond for firearm offences. But Ammouche's lawyer Adam Houda said claims he was a supporter of ISIS was a 'distraction' and 'highly prejudicial'. 'He is charged with two very basic matters and they're unrelated to terrorism.' Ammouche  targeted by counter-terrorism police as part of an investigation into ISIS has been granted bail . This comes after Jibryl Almaouie was charged with a string of offences, including unauthorised firearm possession, also on Friday after a separate terrorism raid in December. The 21-year-old attended Surry Hills Police Station earlier this month where he was arrested at 2.30pm  after counter-terrorism police seized a rifle, two shotguns and a large amount of ammunition at a Condell Park house in Sydney's west on December 18. The two men, who are not co-accused, did not appear when their cases were mentioned in Parramatta Local Court on Saturday. It follows as the raids were carried out in Sydney's southwest, in relation to Operation Duntulm which is part of the Joint Counter Terrorism Team, and allegedly seized a number of items including a quantity of prohibited drugs and documents. It was the same operation which saw the arrest of Mohamed Elomar's wife, Fatima, at Sydney Airport on May 3 when she was trying to board a flight to Malaysia with her four children. It is part of Operation Appleby, which is investigating  domestic terrorism and foreign incursions in Syria and Iraq. Other warrants were executed in Leppington, Condell Park and Punchbowl. Police allege that a quantity of prohibited drugs were seized from another man in Punchbowl. A NSW Police statement said the raids were executed 'not as a result of any specific terrorism threat'. The raids were carried out in Sydney's southwest, in relation to Operation Duntulm which is part of the Joint Counter Terrorism Team, and allegedly seized a number of items including a quantity of prohibited drugs and documents . Other warrants were executed in Leppington, Condell Park and Punchbowl . Operation Duntulm is an ongoing Joint Counter Terrorism Team (Sydney) investigation into alleged financial assistance and support being provided for foreign fighters overseas. Assistant Commissioner Mark Murdoch, Commander of the Counter Terrorism and Special Tactics Command said Operation Duntulm the raids are a timely reminder that police 'will not become complacent, and remain committed to disrupting criminal activity'. 'The operation today is about the gathering of evidence and intelligence to enable us to take action against those who think they can engage in these activities,' he said. 'Investigators this morning seized a range of items from the premises searched including documents and computers, and these will be forensically examined. 'It doesn't matter who you are or what you believe in, if you choose to illegally fight in an overseas conflict you are not only breaking the law, you are placing yourself in immense danger.' Australian Federal Police Acting National Manager Counter Terrorism Peter Crozier said community safety was the primary objective of all Joint Counter Terrorism Team activities. 'The priority for all agencies involved in these operations is to ensure the safety of the community, and we encourage all people to speak to us if they have any concerns or have information they wish to provide,' Acting Assistant Commissioner Crozier said . 'Now more than ever, it is important for the community and police to continue to work together and promote the diverse, inclusive and supportive society we have here in Australia.'

"Schools should stop wasting money on new iPads and other 'shiny gadgets' for pupils and instead spend the cash on hiring 8,000 new teachers, the leader of Britain's largest headteachers' organisation claims. Russell Hobby, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), has questioned whether spending millions on computers and tablet devices can be 'justified at a time of austerity'. According to recent figures by the British Educational Suppliers Association (BESA), approximately a quarter of a billion pounds is spent every year on computers in schools. Russell Hobby, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, has questioned whether spending millions on computers and tablet devices for schools is 'justified in times of austerity' (file picture) In a personal blog post to be published today, Mr Hobby said: 'I think we'd be better spending money on recruiting and training great teachers and sticking them in front of old-fashioned blackboards.' He said the money currently spent on technology in schools was enough to hire 8,000 new teachers or build 40 new secondary schools. In his blog post, seen by the Independent, he also revealed he was 'dubious' about using technology in non-IT lessons. He said: 'It is early days, of course, but an animated presentation on an electronic whiteboard or a lesson plan on an iPad are not transformative in terms of standards. 'Nice, perhaps, time-saving, maybe, but remember the cost.' His comments come as new figures reveal that the amount of money spent on technology by schools hit a new record in 2014. The research, by BESA, was gathered from 1,238 schools across the UK – including 731 primary schools and 507 secondary schools – and suggests that spending on software, hardware and technical support will top £14,000 in each primary school and more than £65,000 in each secondary school. Russell Hobby (pictured) said the money being spent on technology in schools was enough to hire 8,000 new teachers or build 40 secondary schools. He said he was 'dubious' about using technology in non-IT lessons . Louis Coiffait, of NAHT Edge – part of the association which helps further the career of headteachers – also questioned the need for expensive gadgets, such as iPads, in schools. In a separate blog post, he wrote: ‘Billions of pounds is being made by private investors and companies out of education hardware and software. ‘Yes we need more data and evidence about what helps learning and what’s good value for money, but you can’t measure everything that matters. Above anything else, when it comes to education technology what we really need is the engagement, judgement and leadership of skilled and confident teachers. ‘Schools need to be able to decide which tools are best for their students, and support and develop their staff to use and test them. There’s no silver bullet, no revolution and no killer app. ‘Education is a long-term, messy and complicated business. At the very heart of it we need really great teachers and principled leaders. ‘They need to be able to pick the best tools for the job whether that’s something new and exciting, or something old and tested.'","Russell Hobby said it would be 'better spending money on great teachers'

"Love birds, beware: One Ohio county is planning to spike bird seed with birth control in hopes of keeping pigeons from despoiling the renovated exterior of its 19th-century courthouse. Wayne County is spending millions to renovate a courthouse built in 1878 in downtown Wooster. But the county has long had a problem with pigeon droppings on metal statues and other ornamental elements atop the courthouse. Wayne County in Ohio is spending millions to renovate a courthouse built in 1878 in downtown Wooster - but have a rampant pigeon problem. Authorities hope birth control in the bird feed will help curb the population . The wire mesh used to keep the birds away will be removed during the renovation. A county commissioner said there are plans to put birth control chemicals specific to pigeons in bird seed to help control the population. Officials hope it will cut the flock in half with just one application. There have been complaints about the millions of dollars being poured into the repairs. But in response, according to the Wooster Daily Record, Commissioner Ann Obrecht said: 'This project is not a cosmetic fix. It is a structural repair. 'Once these structural repairs are done, the exterior should be good for the next 100 years.' The slate roof on the building is also going to be repaired after 137 years.","Wayne County, Ohio is spending millions to renovate a courthouse built in 1878 in downtown Wooster .

"A millionaire property investor has been slapped with one of the biggest ever fines for unlawful renovations - after building TWO conservatories on his £4 million Listed house. Maurice Lawee, 59, caused 'irreversible damage' to his multi-million pound Grade-II listed home with a pair of extensions. Mr Lawee knocked out chimney breasts, the original staircase, alcoves, and doors and damaged the Flemish bond brickwork - a style of patterned masonry. Barnet Council have now initiated proceedings to order the company director to demolish the two conservatories and replace the bay windows. Mr Lawee purchased the property in 2008 which had its historic bay windows, pictured . Maurice Lawee was fined £45,000 over the construction of the two extensions at the rear of his house . Mr Lawee was also ordered to cover the council's legal costs which amounted to £14,000 after his guilty plea . The unauthorised work on the historic building included removing original features and building two huge conservatories on the back. Mr Lawee has a one-quarter share in Casehill Limited which has current assets of more than £2.1 million according to the most recent company accounts. The company owes almost £142,000 although it reported a profit in 2013 of more than £600,000. Mr Lawee began the building works under the premise of creating an 'iceberg-home'-style basement extension. Barnet Council granted him permission to build an extension to his basement with the installation of a lift, and a garage conversion. But he ignored repeated pleas from the local council to stop the unauthorised work, and was eventually fined almost £60,000 for the illegal work. Barnet Council confimed that Mr Lawee will have to restore the exterior of his house to its original state . A Barnet Council spokeswoman confirmed that Mr Lawee would be ordered to demolish the conservatories. She said: 'Barnet Council has confirmed they are taking steps against Mr Lawee to remove the harmful works, which includes the two conservatory bays.' Mr Lawee ignored the advice of planning officials who told him to stop building the twin extensions . Mr Lawee bought the six-bedroom mock Tudor home, which was built in 1912, for £3.7 million in 2008, in the historic Hampstead Garden Suburb Conservation area, in Hampstead, north west London. He was fined £45,000, the third-highest fine issued by magistrates in England for the offence, and ordered to pay the council's £14,000 legal fees at Willesden Magistrates'Court. Barnet Council's leader, Councillor Richard Cornelius, said: 'Mr Lawee showed a blatant disregard for the fact he was living in a conservation area in a Grade-II listed building when he decided to alter his house in the way he chose fit. 'Planning laws are there for a reason and the high level of fine reflects the seriousness of this breach.' Building to the home designed by architect George Lister Sutcliffe in the exclusive garden suburb requires approval from the Hampstead Garden Suburb Trust, even for building a garden shed. The trust made numerous complaints to the council that Lawee was carrying out unapproved work to the property, which has three bathrooms and three receptions and was listed for conservation in 1996. Lawee and his architect assured conservation officers that he would cease unauthorised work when they visited the luxury property but he continued his renovations. A spokesman for Barnet Council's solicitor, HB Public Law, said: 'Officers gave repeated warnings that work must stop. 'Despite on occasions promises being made for this to happen, works continued regardless, stripping out much of the interior of the house, changing the proportions and the spaces, partially demolishing the outhouses and building. 'Irreversible damage has been caused to the brickwork and outhouse and original features appear to have been destroyed or removed from the building.' Mr Lawee admitted four offences of carrying out unauthorised work. David Davidson, architectural adviser for the Hampstead Garden Suburb Trust, said: 'The Hampstead Garden Suburb Trust is very pleased that the Court has taken these offences seriously and imposed such a substantial fine on the building owner. 'The Suburb is an area of international significance in the history of town planning and architecture, and alterations to its buildings need to be carefully considered in order to retain its special characteristics. 'Mr Lawee chose to ignore the planning regulations which exist to protect Listed Buildings from damaging alterations.' Lawee has gained retrospective approval from the council for some of the changes but may be ordered to demolish the rest of his renovations. He applied for planning permission for some of his renovations only after he had begun construction and Barnet later approved four of the changes. Despite gaining retrospective permission, Lawee still must pay the fine because he did not get approval before he carried out the work. Mr Lawee successfully applied for retrospective planning permission for several of his alterations . Council officials have told Mr Lawee that he must demolish the unauthorised conservatories . But he is appealing over several refusals including the he had built and Barnet may order for them to be destroyed if he loses his appeal. Lawee will have to pull down the two large conservatories built at the back of his property following the magistrates' ruling on Tuesday last week. The community in the leafy suburb is divided as to whether he should be allowed to carry out his desired renovations. A neighbour said: 'I don't see what the problem is. People spend a lot of hard earned money on their properties. Who are we to tell him what to do with his house? ""It's his house, why is it our business what he does to it? 'There's a division in the area between the old-school suburban people and the new money coming in. Actually, I think the old school need to relax a bit.' One neighbourhood stalwart, who has lived there for more than 30 years, believes Lawee should be forced to convert the property back to its original state. He said: 'With all due respect, you get people coming here who a £45,000 fine would be cheap. 'There are Russian oligarchs and rich Arabs moving to the area who could happily pay that fine in order to build whatever they want. 'Rather than a fine they should just be ordered to convert the property back to how it is.' Lawee is yet to respond to request for comment.","Businessman Maurice Lawee built an unauthorised extension to his home .

"A study found there is no link between escess salt consumption in over-70s and mortality . Eating too much salt is not linked to the risk of death or heart disease among older adults – contrary to current medical advice, say researchers. A new US study found in older pensioners aged over 70 there was no association between levels of salt intake and mortality, or chances of developing heart disease and heart failure. However, the research was based on the self-reported salt intake of those taking part which may affect the findings. Excess salt is a major contributor to high blood pressure, leading to heart disease and stroke. Although UK salt intake has fallen in recent years, the average daily intake of 8.6g remains above the target level of 6g. New targets commit the UK to working towards a maximum 5g a day by 2025. The study of 2,642 adults who ranged in age from 71 to 80 looked at dietary sodium consumption. Salt contains 40 per cent sodium, so recommended levels of sodium are lower than the salt equivalent. Dr Andreas Kalogeropoulos, of Emory University, Atlanta, and colleagues looked at the link between sodium intake and death rates, and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and heart failure. They analysed follow-up data on the adults taking part, whose dietary sodium intake was assessed at the start of the study with a questionnaire. After 10 years, 881 of the participants had died, 572 had developed CVD and 398 had developed heart failure. Sodium intake was not associated with death or new development of heart problems, according to study results. Ten-year death rates were 33.8 percent, 30.7 percent and 35.2 percent among participants consuming less than 1,500 mg/d, 1,500 to 2,300 mg/d, and greater than 2,300 mg/d of sodium, respectively. In the US, the recommended sodium intake for adults over 50 is less than 1,500 mg/day or 3.75g of salt. The researchers said more testing was needed before older people were exhorted to restrict their sodium intake to below 2,300 mg/day – the equivalent of around 6g of salt - recommended for the general adult population. ‘Our data emphasise the need for stronger evidence, preferably from rigorous controlled trials testing additional thresholds for sodium intake’ said the study. The study was criticised by some doctors and academics for the weak method of assessing salt intake which meant it was in danger of misleading the public, it was claimed. Excess salt is a major contributor to high blood pressure, leading to heart disease and stroke . Dr Tim Chico, Reader in Cardiovascular Medicine and consultant cardiologist, University of Sheffield, said salt intake was based on a single questionnaire and the findings were dependent on consumption remaining unchanged over 10 years. He said ‘At the end of the day, most people don’t need a doctor or a scientist to tell them that an apple is almost certainly healthier than a packet of crisps.’ Prof Jeremy Pearson, Associate Medical Director at the British Heart Foundation, said ‘The study showed that risk of cardiovascular disease was not significantly different for people over 70 years old with a similar blood pressure but differing levels of salt intake. ‘However, blood pressure can be influenced by a number of factors and the finding that people with a similar blood pressure had a similar risk of cardiovascular disease is not surprising. ‘More research is therefore needed before recommending further restrictions on salt intake for older adults. ‘This study does not contradict current dietary guidelines that people should consume less than 6g of salt per day. ‘There is global agreement that lowering the amount of salt you consume will lower blood pressure which can significantly reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease.’","New US study found in older pensioners there was no association between levels of salt intake and mortality .

"A third of Scots want to see Britain run by a Labour-SNP coalition which could put Alex Salmond in the Cabinet. Ed Miliband faces the grim prospect of a Labour wipeout north of the border, seriously damaging his hopes of securing an overall majority in the general election in May. Now a new poll of voters in Scotland reveals they favour Mr Miliband being forced into a power-sharing deal with the SNP instead of going it alone. Ed Miliband faces the prospect of being forced to share power with Alex Salmond's SNP after a collapse in support for Labour in Scotland . Mr Salmond quit as Scottish First Minister and SNP leader after losing the referendum on his long-held dream for independence. But he now plans to stand as an MP in May's general election, raising the prospect of him becoming a minister in a new coalition. A Survation poll for the Daily Record newspaper revealed that 35.1 per cent of Scottish voters would prefer to see a deal between Labour and the SNP. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has previously said she could not envisage the SNP entering a formal coalition with Labour, but could see the party negotiating a 'confidence and supply' arrangement. However, Mr Miliband has failed to categorically rule out such an arrangement. The poll showed that a majority Labour government was the second most popular result among Scottish voters, with 19.8 per cent backing such an outcome, while 13.8 per cent backed a Tory majority. A total of 4.7 per cent of people want to see another Tory/Lib Dem coalition, while 8 per cent want to see Labour and the Lib Dems rule together, and 5.5 per cent would like the Tories and Ukip in power. A further 9.3 per cent favour an SNP/Tory coalition, while 3.8 per cent back a Labour/Ukip pairing. Despite losing the independence referendum in September, there has been a surge in support for the SNP. A Survation poll for the Daily Record newspaper revealed that 35.1 per cent of Scottish voters would prefer to see a deal between Labour and the SNP . In the Survation poll 46 per cent now back the SNP with just 26 per cent supporting Labour and 14 per cent backing the Tories. A further 7 per cent intend to vote Lib Dem, while the remaining 7 per cent support other parties. It repeated at the election, the SNP would win 52 seats and Labour would be reduced to a rump of just six. SNP depute leader Stewart Hosie said: 'We are taking absolutely nothing for granted and will work hard for every vote in May. 'With Labour MPs voting with the Tories for GBP30 billion more austerity cuts, people across Scotland can put their trust in the SNP to stand up for their interests, and use our clout in a hung Westminster parliament to end austerity. 'And it's clear that there is widespread support for the greatest possible devolution of powers to Holyrood. 'But the Westminster Government simply isn't willing to give Scotland the powers we need to build a more equal society and more competitive economy - and that is why we need a strong team of SNP MPs elected next May to hold them to account, and ensure that they finally deliver on their vow to Scotland.' The poll results for the general election would mean substantial gains in the number of SNP MPs returned to Westminster, contrasted with substantial losses for Labour in Scotland. Many observers believe that Mr Miliband may need support from the nationalists to form a government. Asked whether he will seek a coalition with the SNP if the election result is not conclusive, the Labour leader said earlier this month: ''I am not about deals and coalitions.' But during the interview on BBC1's Andrew Marr show, he repeatedly refused to rule out a deal with Ms Sturgeon's party.","35% of Scottish voters want to see a Labour-SNP coalition after election .

"No snarl is more famous. Eyes squinting, mouth contorted, 15-year-old Hazel Bryan became the face of racial intolerance during the civil rights movement in 1957. It was the first day of school for Little Rock Central High students in Little Rock, Arkansas, where nine black students would be admitted for the first time in history. Joining her jeering white classmates, Hazel swarmed behind Elizabeth Eckford, a new black pupil. Pushing her way to the front, she was overheard by a New York Times reporter: 'Go back to Africa!' As she spat those words, Will Count took the infamous picture printed in the next day's edition of the Arkansas Democrat - as well as almost every national newspaper around the world. Scroll down for video . Infamous: Hazel Bryan, 15, pictured shouting at Elizabeth Eckford, also 15, on the first day of integration at Little Rock Central High School in Arkansas, 1957. The picture swept the world and symbolized racial tensions . Almost 70 years later, in a moving book that interviews both figures in the symbolic image, it has emerged that was just the start of the journey for Elizabeth and Hazel - who came close to reconciliation before it all broke down once more. The pair appeared smiling together in 1997 in front of Central High, where then-President Bill Clinton spoke for the 40th anniversary of the school's integration. But it was not quite the triumphant rapprochement touted. 'Hazel was thrilled, Elizabeth, curious,' writes author David Margolick in an extract from Elizabeth and Hazel: Two Women Of Little Rock published by Slate. The five years that followed saw the two women courted by historians, analysts, politicians, broadcasters - all wanting a slice of their story. Rapprochement? The classmates were reunited in 1997 for the 40th anniversary in an apparent reconciliation . Little Rock Nine: In 1957, the first black students were admitted to Central High (left-right) Thelma Mothershed Wair, Minnijean Brown Trickey, Jefferson Thomas, Terrence Roberts, Carlotta Walls LaNier, Gloria Ray Karlmark, Ernest Green, Elizabeth Eckford, and Melba Pattillo Beals. The reunited for the 40th anniversary . They even appeared on Oprah, who did not hide her distaste of their friendship. Hazel's face had epitomized the three-week struggle at Little Rock Central High, when Governor Orval Faubus blocked nine black students from enrolling at a high school with about 2,000 white students. In September 1957, Terrence Roberts, Carlotta Walls LaNier, Melba Patillo Beals, Elizabeth Eckford, Ernest Green, Gloria Ray Karlmark, Jefferson Thomas, Minnijean Brown Trickey, and Thelma Mothershed Wair arrived at the school, having applied and been accepted to join. The Supreme Court had declared segregated classrooms unconstitutional in 1954. Little Rock School Board voted to integrate - but Faubus said he feared violence if the races mixed in a public school. In a battle that involved President Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Army's 101st Airborne Division were deployed to man the situation. Two sides to a difficult story: A book by author David Margolick looks at how both women dealt with fame in the wake of that photograph that swept the globe . However, cracks appeared during an interview where Hazel revealed she had never dedicated much thought to the incendiary image of her 15-year-old self - a revelation which shocked and devastated Elizabeth. On September 11, 2001, they spoke for the last time before cutting ties. Meeting both women, now in their 70s, Margolick heard two sides of the story. Hazel Bryan Massery, who still resides in Little Rock decided soon after the incident to read up on her ignorance; she helped black women in broken marriages; studied Martin Luther King Jr's speeches; listened to reports of racially-aggravated attacks on the radio. Elizabeth Eckford, on the other hand, had struggled through deaths and destitution. 'With enormous courage and resiliency, Elizabeth ultimately made a life for herself and has largely come to peace with her past,' Margolick writes. 'Paradoxically, it’s been Hazel, who has led a life of far greater financial and familial security, who now feels wounded and angry.' After leaving school at 17, marrying, and having kids, Hazel was desperate to atone: 'One day, she realized, her children would learn that that snarling girl in their history books was their mother. She realized she had an account to settle.' Aged 20, Hazel called Elizabeth to tearfully apologize, opening the gates for a highly-publicized relationship to form. But it was plagued with issues. Though Hazel helped Elizabeth to work through her issues and find a job, Elizabeth felt uneasy about their relationship and uncertain about Hazel's attempts to make up for her bullying. Their posed picture did not betray the awkwardness between them, Margolick explains, and over the years they would struggle when questioned about their new-found friendship. In 1998, an interviewer asked Hazel about the image and she said she never gave it much thought. The reaction, yes. The image wasn't discussed, she claimed. Elizabeth was shocked and expressed her disappointment. Finally, it was Hazel that severed ties as she felt an irreconcilable tension between them. But Margolick suggests it is not over. He writes: 'Each, I noticed, teared up at references to the other. Perhaps, when no one is looking—or taking any pictures—they’ll yet come together again. And if they can, maybe, so too, can we.'","Infamous photo captured white pupil Hazel Bryan jeering at black classmate Elizabeth Eckford on first day of integration in Little Rock, AR .

"They're not usually the food or drinks you would consider exceptionally unhealthy. But smoothies, milk and  bacon have been revealed as foods for containing sky high levels of sugar, salt and fat. And even Britain's favourite Terry's Chocolate Orange contains more than 150 per cent of an adult's recommended amount of saturated fat. Pizza Express' American pizza's salt content is 110 per cent of the recommended daily amount . A two-liter bottle of Pepsi (left) contains 220g of sugar and the Innocent smoothie has 35g. Alongside the surprisingly unhealthy foods are more obvious items such as gammon steaks, pork pies and pizzas. Ten of the worst examples have been exposed by expert food and drink taster Martin Isark, founder of the consumer website Can I Eat It. Just one of these favourite treats would take you over the safe daily allowance for fat, salt and sugar. Mr Isark found that a single unsmoked gammon steak from Sainsbury's contains 6.8g of salt, equivalent to 114 per cent of an adult's recommended daily limit. A Ginsters Extra Large Cornish Pasty has 20.4g of saturated fat, which is 102 per cent of an adult's recommended daily intake. And a Pizza Express American pizza, sold in a variety of supermarkets, has 6.5g of salt, equal to 110 per cent of the recommended daily amount. Four rashers of Wall's unsmoked bacon contained 6.8g of salt, 112 per cent of the daily limit for the average adult. And pork pie lovers could be in for a shock too. A Pork Farms Original Pork Pie, weighing 300g and available from discounter Lidl has a whopping 30.4g of saturated fat - 152 per cent of an adult's recommended daily intake. Danger foods: Pork Farms pork pies contain 30.4g of saturated fat whilst Waitrose's A Seriously Pistachio Hazlenut and Almond Milk Chocolate Egg has 20g of saturated fat and 27.6g of sugar . Terry's Chocolate Orange contains more than 150% of an adult's recommended amount of saturated fat . Dessert loves face a double whammy of unhealthy ingredients as sugar and fat content rockets in some supermarket favourites. A Seriously Pistachio Hazlenut and Almond Milk Chocolate Egg from Waitrose contains 20g of saturated fat, equal to 100 per cent of an adult's daily limit, plus 27.6g of sugar, equal to a third of the daily recommended amount of sugar. Terry's Chocolate Orange contains an astonishing 30.5g of saturated fat, more than 150 per cent of an adult's recommended amount, as well as 102g of sugar, equal to 113 per cent of an adult's suggested health limit. Some drinks are in danger of pushing consumers over the health limit too. An Innocent Smoothie Pomegranate Blueberry and Acai drink contains 35g of sugar, equilvalent to 3.5 Krispy Kreme Original Glazed Donuts. It has almost 30 per cent more sugar per 100ml than Coca-Cola, and is the most sugar-rich smoothie on the market. And a carton of Mars Flavoured Milk has 128g of sugar, which is 142 per cent of an adult's recommended daily intake. Mr Isark said: 'Your long-term health starts with the types of food and drink you put in your shopping trolley. 'A portion of food that contains more than your daily allowance, of salt, saturated fat and sugar are potential killers - leave them on the shelf.

"Nowadays, more than half of children in the UK are born out of wedlock, but five decades ago the outlook for an unmarried mother was bleak. This is the reason that Carol Driscoll was given by her parents in 1965, when they forced her to choose between her boyfriend Ken and her unborn child, who they named Kevin. After discovering that their child was pregnant at the age of 18, her mother and father gave her an ultimatum – keep your baby or leave your boyfriend. Carol made the heart-breaking decision to put her baby up for adoption and she and Ken ended up marrying and having six more children together, but they never stopped thinking about their firstborn. Carol Driscoll, 68, from Croydon, ((left) was forced to choose between her baby and boyfriend Ken aged 18. She picked Ken (right) and the couple married and had six more children together, but spent years searching for their firstborn. Fifty years on, they have been reunited with their son, who is now called David (centre) Now, 50 years later, the couple have been reunited with their son - who is now called David Jones - and the three adults are finally learning how to be a family. Carol has now revealed that until she reconnected with David, she always felt like a piece of her was missing. The 68-year-old from Croydon, south London, was given no choice but to give up her child by her parents, and tried for years to find him after being made to give him away to a couple in Horsham, East Sussex. She was sent to a mother and baby home in her last trimester and after he was born, was given just five weeks with him before her mother picked her up and drove her to Horsham to hand the child over. Carol told The Mirror: ‘Every time I was pregnant it brought it all back. I'd wonder what Kevin was like, what he was doing. ‘I think they thought I'd forget, but you don't forget a baby.’ David as a baby after he was given up for adoption . Carol and Ken first met aged 14 and starting dating four years later. When, just a few months into their relationship, Carol discovered she had fallen pregnant, her parents were outraged and locked her in her room. Carol and Ken on their wedding day in 1966 . They gave her an ultimatum of her baby or Ken after deciding that the young couple wouldn’t be able to give their child a decent start in life with the minimal salaries they earned as a TV electrician and an audio typist. After picking Ken, Carol was forced to return to work, where her colleagues often questioned her about her unborn child – the due date and the baby’s father. Although Ken and Carol both desperately wanted to keep their baby, a UK law at the time which has since been changed, forbade anyone under the age of 21 from getting married without their parents’ permission. But to prevent her from being the subject of unkind gossip as an unmarried pregnant woman, Ken bought his girlfriend a fake engagement ring and wedding band. She said: ‘If you walked around with a bump and didn't have a ring on people would stare.’ After giving birth, Carol moved back home and tried to continue her life, requesting a transfer at work so that she wouldn’t have to face any questions from colleagues about how her baby was getting along. A year later, Carol and Ken were married and went on to have four other sons - Paul, 45, Martin, 43, twins, James and Jonathan, 32 - and two daughters, Rachel, 36, and Ruth, 34. But they always wondered what became of their first child. After a few years, Carol started trying to find her son, but as she was never given the birth certificate, she had no leads to start with. David as a boy . David's adoptive parents, who he says gave him a wonderful childhood . Desperate, she joined a missing person’s website and posted every detail she could remember about her child from the few weeks she’d had with him. Then three years ago, the couple discovered that a change in the law meant she could apply for Kevin’s birth certificate and she set about finding him, posting a new message every year on his birthday. With the help of her local council, she tracked down Kevin, who was now called David Jones, to a three-bedroom terraced house in Lydiate, Merseyside. David, who is a married accountant with three children of his own, Nicola, 23, Kyle, 13, and Maya, 11, was amazed to receive a letter from his birth parents. After being given a happy childhood by his adoptive parents – a housewife and engineer – he was reluctant to get in touch with his birth family in case it upset him. Carol and Ken Driscoll with their son David who they gave up for adoption now reunited at their home in Croydon south London .Back row: Left to right, Chris, Jonathan and James, middle row: Left to right: Joan, Carol David Ken and Rachel. Front row: Emma, Kyle, Maya and Lauren) Then after they passed away 20 years ago, he held back from looking for his family in case his birth parents had no desire to meet him. After receiving the letter from Ken, who now works as a consultant testing engineer, and Carol, David called them up and the three adults arranged to meet up in London. David said: ‘The resemblance was startling. I called them mum and dad - it just seemed right. There were a few tears.’ He has now been introduced to his six brothers and sisters and their 13 grandchildren and his small family are getting used to becoming part of such a large unit. He said: ‘It was a bit daunting but everyone has made me so welcome.’","Carol Driscoll had to choose between her baby and boyfriend aged 18 .

"Chimpanzees learn kindness by watching and experiencing the compassion of others, a new study suggests. Scientists claim it’s the first evidence that both children and chimps share common traits of altruism that are learned from the sociable behaviour of peers. The study seems to offer fresh evidence of the evolutionary roots of kindness in humans and non-human primates. Scroll down for video . Compassionate: Chimpanzees (pictured) learn kindness by watching and experiencing the compassion of others, a new study suggests. Scientists claim it’s the first evidence that both children and chimps share common traits of altruism that are learned from the sociable behaviour of peers . Researchers from the University of St Andrews and Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, demonstrated that contrary to earlier findings, in certain conditions, primates display similar behaviour to humans. Professor Andrew Whiten explained: ‘A regard for the welfare of others is seen as a cardinal human virtue. By contrast, several recent scientific studies have concluded that the same dispositions are lacking in our closest living primate relatives. ‘The results of our research provide the first evidence that both children and chimpanzees share common traits of altruism that are learned as a direct result of experiencing the kindness of others.’ His team studied and compared the ‘prosocial’ actions of children aged between four and eight years old, as well as those of adults, chimpanzees and capuchin monkeys, according to the study, published in Nature’s Scientific Reports. They came to their conclusion after conducting experiments with pairs of chimpanzees (left), monkeys, children (right) and adults, which involved them rewarding each other with food in boxes. Researchers were interested in whether participants provided rewards to others, as well as the quality of the rewards . The researchers studied the ‘prosocial’ actions of children aged between four and eight years old, as well as those of adults, chimpanzees and capuchin monkeys. They defined it as voluntary actions that benefit individuals or society, such as helping, sharing and co-operating with others. Such actions are considered essential for maintaining effective communities, offering immediate benefit and encouraging mutual exchange in the future. Motivating factors for prosocial actions include empathy, which is recognised to have deep evolutionary roots, altruism, practical considerations and self-interest. The study revealed that like children, chimpanzees learn kindness – a prosocial behaviour - by watching and experiencing the compassion of others. They defined prosocial behaviour as voluntary actions that benefit individuals or society, such as helping, sharing and co-operating with others. Such actions are considered essential for maintaining effective communities, offering immediate benefit and encouraging mutual exchange in the future. For the study, participants were paired within each species and the responses of individuals accessing food rewards were analysed. Researchers were interested in whether participants provided rewards to others and the quality of the rewards. They discovered that that young children and capuchin monkeys didn’t display any prosocial traits in certain situations, but that human adults gave their partner a more preferred reward even when they could only receive the less preferred reward. Some children and chimpanzees who didn’t show kindness were partnered with others who showed generous behaviour towards them. They were later found to act more kindly themselves and were more likely to reward others. Professor Whiten said: ‘We believe our study is the first to demonstrate that the prosocial behaviour of humans and non-human primates is shaped by the everyday social actions of those around them. ‘Kindness may thrive, evolve and inspire when helping, sharing or donating are part of the cultural experience.' The chimpanzees and capuchin monkeys were studied at the University of Texas and the University of St Andrews’ research centre in Edinburgh Zoo. Monkey see, monkey don't: The study revealed that capuchin monkeys (stock image shown) and young children didn’t display any prosocial traits in certain situations.

"Scientists have uncovered a remarkable parallel between the way humans build cities on Earth and how galaxies form in space. They say how galaxies evolve is mathematically equivalent to the way settlements grow. American linguist George Kingsley Zipf noticed that if cities are listed according to size, then the rank of a city is inversely proportional to the number of people who live in it. Scientists have uncovered a remarkable parallel between the way humans build cities on Earth and how galaxies form in space. Pictured on the left is Antwerp, and on the right galaxy NGC 3310 . For instance, if the largest city in a country has a population of 10 million, the second-biggest will have a population of five million (10 divided by 2), and the third a population of 2.5 million. 'Zipft's law' is a scaling law. It can also be found in the strange fact that whether one person will be friends with another, is inversely proportional to the number of people who live closer to the first person than the second. But while scientists know the law to be true, they have no idea why it works. Now researchers claim they have the source of these scaling laws in space, according to Quartz. Henry Lin and Abraham Loeb at the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics in Cambridge have used models for showing how galaxies evolve to create a theory for scaling laws on Earth. American linguist George Kingsley Zipf noticed that if cities are listed according to size, then the rank of a city is inversely proportional to the number of people who live in it (shown by the black dots). The blue dashed line shows how the population is predicted to behave according to Zipf's law . 'We treat the population density as the fundamental quantity, thinking of cities as objects that form when the population density exceeds a critical threshold,' Lin and Loeb wrote in their research paper. 'The situation is therefore conceptually and mathematically analogous to the formation of galaxies in the universe.' According to a report by MIT Technology Review, the team used models governing the spread of galaxies, to show that this approach works for urban growth. They then analysed any variations in the density, and used equations to predict how this density can grow over time. 'The results are in good agreement with the theoretical prediction across a broad range of spatial scales, from a few km to ∼ 10^3 km.' Their research suggests human behaviour on a massive scale follows the same patterns as galaxy growth. They believe this unifying theory for scaling law, can also be used to predict other phenomenon, such as the spread of disease.

This relationship is known as the scaling law, and can also be found in the strange fact that whether one person will be friends with another, is inversely proportional to the number of people who live closer to the first person than the second. Another example of Zipf's law is in language. It states that the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table. This means the most frequent word will occur twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word.","The way settlements grow are governed by something known as 'Zipf's law'

"Ed Miliband's plan to impose a mansion tax is 'crude' and would end up 'clobbering' people, Lord Mandelson warned last night. The Labour grandee launched a stinging attack of the party leader's flagship policy claiming it was 'short-termist'. To add further insult, Lord Mandelson, one of the architects of New Labour, said he preferred the policy drawn up by the Liberal Democrats to introduce extra council tax bands for high-value homes. Scroll down for video . Lord Mandelson (right), one of the architects of New Labour, has described Labour leader Ed Miliband's (left) plan to impose mansion tax as 'crude' and 'short-termist' and said he prefers the Liberal Democrats proposal . Mr Miliband has said his plan for a mansion tax on homes worth more than £2million would raise £1.2billion a year, which would be spent on the NHS. But he is already facing civil war within his party over the policy, with strong criticism from many including potential London Mayoral candidates Diane Abbott, Dame Tessa Jowell, David Lammy and Margaret Hodge. In an interview with BBC Newsnight last night, Lord Mandelson acknowledged: 'We don't have an efficient way of taxing property in Britain.' But he added: 'I don't happen to think the mansion tax is the right policy response to that, I think it's crude, I think it's short-termist, what we need is what I think the Liberal Democrats are proposing and that is the introduction of further bands that relate to different values of property within the council tax system, that's what I would like to see, it will take longer to introduce, that's true, but it will be more effective and efficient in the long term than just sort of clobbering people with a rather sort of crude short-term mansion tax.' Full details have yet to be announced, but Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls last year said homes worth between £2million and £3million will face an annual bill of £3,000, regardless of income. Critics warn the tax will disproportionately hit London and the South East, where many ordinary family homes will be caught by the plans. Labour estimates the tax will apply to fewer than 0.5 per cent of the homes in the country. People earning less than £42,000 will be able to defer paying the charge until their property changes hands in an effort to protect people, especially in the capital, who have seen the value of their house soar in recent years. Lord Mandelson said: 'You do need a fair, progressive taxation system where people who are earning the most and accumulating the most wealth pay the most. 'And for very many people they shouldn't pay anything at all, because they simply don't have the incomes, or the wealth, or the assets, to support that.' The former business secretary said he was not worried about the message being sent out by the mansion tax, but he added: 'I want policy effectiveness, I want efficiency. 'I think people are entitled to expect thought-through, sophisticated responses to serious problems.' He told Newsnight: 'We have to make sure that what we are doing is, in a sense, recreating the policies that we saw in the Clinton-Blair era, where we saw a pro-business, liberal economic approach but combined with very strong policies and interventions by government in order to create opportunities for individuals and to redistribute income and wealth more fairly.' Conservative party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘With Mandelson joining the chorus of Labour voices opposed to Labour's homes tax, it is clearer than ever that Ed Miliband is a weak leader peddling a bad policy. 'It is yet more proof that he simply isn't up to the job of running the country.’ The Liberal Democrat plan, backed by Lord Mandelson, would involve a series of extra bands of taxation for properties worth more than £2million on top of council tax. Earlier this month, Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy caused outrage from within the party after he set out plans to use millions of pounds raised from the tax in England to pay for 1,000 extra nurses north of the border. In November, Ed Miliband (centre) was left humiliated after he was unceremoniously taken to task over the mansion tax proposal by singer and classical musician Myleene Klass (left) in a heated television debate . MPs queued up to attack Mr Murphy after he boasted that would boost the NHS in Scotland by using up to £250million raised from the tax in England. Just 0.3 per cent of the £1.2billion raised by the tax - around £3.6million - will come from Scotland, but it will receive a huge share of the revenues. Former Labour leadership Miss Abbott accused Mr Murphy of trying to 'buy Scottish votes with money expropriated from London'. And former Labour Cabinet minister Dame Tessa warned him against treating the South East as a 'cash cow'. In November, Mr Miliband was left humiliated after he was unceremoniously taken to task over the proposal by Myleene Klass. The singer and classical musician tore strips out of his pledge during a television debate, telling him that it was 'disturbing'. 'You may as well just tax me on this glass of water,' she told him during the angry exchange. 'You can't just point at things and tax them.' A year after New Labour came to power in 1997, Lord Mandelson famously said: 'We are intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich as long as they pay their taxes.' He bought an £8million house in London four years ago. A Labour Party spokeswoman said: 'The mansion tax will help fund a Time To Care Fund to pay for 20,000 more nurses, 8,000 more GPs, 5,000 more home care workers and 3,000 more midwives. 'When working people have seen their wages fall by £1,600 a year since 2010 it is right to ask those who have the most to make a bigger contribution.'","Lord Mandelson described mansion tax plan as 'crude' and 'short-termist'

"Maureen Hanlan, 71, has been diagnosed with breast cancer despite having had both her breasts removed in a double mastectomy nine years ago . A pensioner has been diagnosed with breast cancer for a third time – even though she has no breasts. Maureen Hanlan, 71, from Christchurch, Dorset, thought it was impossible for her to ever get breast cancer again after having both her breasts removed in a double mastectomy. However, nine years later she is once again facing a battle to survive, after what she believed was a skin rash turned out to be breast cancer. Her doctors said the chances of cancer returning after a mastectomy were so rare they had never encountered or even heard of such a case. Ms Hanlan now faces a lifetime of taking anti-cancer drugs to keep the tumour at bay. Formerly a theatre worker, she said the high profile case of Angelina Jolie had led people to believe that the operation was a fix-all solution. The actress had a double mastectomy in 2013 after finding out she had a gene linked to cancer. However, Ms Hanlan said: 'I was totally convinced after having the mastectomy that I would not get breast cancer any more. 'Nobody had told me you could still get breast cancer after such a major operation. 'I read in the newspaper that Angelina Jolie had had a double mastectomy after finding out she had the cancer gene. 'I wonder if she was aware that, although very rare, she could still get breast cancer?' Doctors said while Ms Hanlan's experience is 'unusual' it is 'not unheard of'. During a double mastectomy, nearly all of the breast tissue is removed, but cancer can still return to the chest area. The more lymph nodes (small masses of tissue that help the body fight infection and disease) with cancer at the time of the mastectomy, the higher the chance the disease may return. Breast cancer cells can also spread to other areas of the body through the lymph nodes and tumours could grow in places including the lungs, bones and skin. Ms Hanlan was told she needed the drastic operation after suffering two breast cancer scares, the first in 1990 and then again 2002. She opted for a double mastectomy despite the fact that cancer was only present in one of her breasts because her grandmother had died of the disease. All was well for the next 10 years until she developed a worrying, lumpy rash over both of her breasts. Actress Angelina Jolie  had a double mastectomy in 2013 after finding out she had a gene linked to cancer. She was told she had an 87 per cent chance of breast cancer due to the inherited gene. But Ms Hanlan believes her case has led people to believe that the operation is a 'fix all solution' She visited her GP who referred her to a dermatologist but was told she would have to wait three months for an appointment on the NHS. Ms Hanlan opted to go private and secured a consultation within a week - a decision she admits probably saved her life. 'That's probably why I'm still here today,' she said, 'The dermatologist who saw me said we should do a biopsy just in case it was anything more serious and that was what revealed the cancer.' She said she was 'absolutely terrified' when the doctor told her she had breast cancer. While most people have no further problems, sometimes breast cancer can return. Local recurrence . If breast cancer comes back in the chest/breast area, or in the skin near the original site or the scar, this is called local recurrence. This means there are remaining cancer cells in the local area which have not been completely removed by the initial surgery or treatment. It is not the same as the cancer spreading. If this happens, patients usually need further surgery, but it is treatable. Regional recurrence (also called locally advanced) Breast cancer can also come back when it has spread beyond the breast and the lymph nodes under the arm  into the tissues and lymph nodes around the chest, neck and under the breastbone. Treatment for regional recurrence will depend on previous treatments, but could include surgery, radiotherapy and drug treatments. People who have a regional recurrence are thought to have an increased risk of cancer cells spreading to other areas of the body. Treatments such as chemotherapy, hormone and targeted therapies are given because they are systemic treatments which work throughout the whole body. When breast cancer spreads to other parts of the body such as the bones, lungs, liver or brain, this is called secondary breast cancer. Source: Breast Cancer Care . 'First of all I was shocked - I couldn't believe it. I was totally devastated,' she added. 'I had been so happy that day - it was my sister's birthday and I'd just bought a property, a beautiful garden flat, and I was so high on that. 'I went into the surgery bouncing with joy and I sat down and the nurse asked me if I wanted my results. I said ""yes, of course"", not thinking for a second that she was going to say those awful words again. 'Then she just said it - ""it's breast cancer again"" - and I just couldn't believe it, I just broke down. 'The doctor cuddled me and hugged me and said ""I'm so sorry"". 'I said ""I can't go through chemo again, I just can't do it"".' She will now have to take the anti-cancer drug Tamoxifen for life. Alongside the help of her son, Jake, she says she could not have got through the ordeal without the help of cancer charity Macmillan. 'They were so helpful to me emotionally and financially and even paid for me to go away for a holiday. 'They also gave me a visit at home one evening when I was feeling pretty rough. 'They really did see me through that bad time, and I will always be thankful to them for that.' Ms Hanlan is now hoping to find out whether any other cancer sufferers in the UK have gone through the same ordeal. She said: 'There was a lot of emotion there, but happiness at the end of it. 'I'm going to keep fighting it, I'm not going anywhere, I'm going to stay here and annoy more people and grow old disgracefully, as they say. 'I should probably be happy that I'm still alive, that I'm still here, but I don't want to leave it at that. 'I'm the type of person who needs an answer, and I want to help other cancer sufferers. 'There must be other people who have been through the same thing, or who know what it is. 'It's been a long bumpy journey, with lots of highs and lows. 'However, I'm extremely grateful I'm still here to tell the tale and I'm just hoping to God that I will have a clean bill of health for the rest of my days.' A leading breast cancer charity said that Ms Hanlan's third cancer diagnosis following a double masectomy was 'unusual.' 'It is not unheard of but extremely unusual,' said Sally Greenbrook, a senior policy advisor at Breakthrough Breast Cancer, which funds research into prevention, detection and treatment of the UK's most common cancer. Ms Hanlan will now take anti-cancer drugs for the rest of her life to keep the tumour at bay. She hopes to find others like her - who developed breast cancer despite having had a mastectomy . 'One in eight women will face breast cancer in their lifetime. After having a double mastectomy, it would be very rare for breast cancer to re-occur,' she added. 'It is always going to be a shock when breast cancer comes back, especially after a double mastectomy,' she said. 'It is unusual, but we have heard of such cases coming up. After removing most of the breast tissue, it can recur in the chest wall.' It could also spread to cells in other parts of the body, even after invasive surgery, and guarantees can never be made, she added. She reiterated that mastectomies hit the headlines in 2013 after actress Angelina Jolie revealed she had undergone the surgery as a preventative measure as her BRCA gene mutation made her a high risk for developing breast cancer. Emphasising that star's preventative procedure was different from Maureen's treatment for cancer, Ms Greenbrook said anecdotal evidence showed that Ms Jolie going public with her story had encouraged many women with a family history of breast cancer to come forward for tests.","Maureen Hanlan, 71, had a double mastectomy nine years ago .

"The Most Rev Justin Welby said most employers could afford to pay the living wage . The Archbishop of Canterbury yesterday told all employers that they should pay the living wage – even though the Church of England pays less to its own low-paid workers. The Most Rev Justin Welby said that most businesses can afford to pay the living wage – which is at least £1.35 more than the minimum wage – and told them: ‘Just get on with it.’ He added in an interview with ITV News: ‘It can be done, and it should be done. It is not two holidays in Bermuda every year.’ However Archbishop Welby rapidly came under criticism for telling other employers to do what the Church refuses to do itself. One Tory MP, Philip Davies, accused him of hypocrisy, saying: ‘He should be getting his own house in order before he goes around lecturing everyone else.’ The row over the Church and the living wage follows Archbishop Welby’s charge last week that ‘there are entire towns and regions of our country that are being left trapped in an apparently inescapable economic downward spiral’. In a contribution to a book edited by the CofE’s number two, Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu, he called for ‘solidarity’ to replace individualism and consumerism. In the book, widely seen as an attempt by the Archbishops to intervene in the election campaign, he said the country should have an economic programme based on four ‘essential building blocks’, with one of them the living wage. The Church’s failure to pay the living wage itself opens Archbishop Welby to the same kind of embarrassment he suffered in 2013 when he pledged that the Church would encourage credit unions to compete payday lender Wonga ‘out of existence’. It then turned out that the Church had a £75,000 investment in Wonga. The living wage is worked out, with the backing of charities and some major companies at a level calculated against the cost of living, to allow a decent standard of living. The idea has backing from both David Cameron and Ed Miliband. It is set this year at £7.85, and £9.15 in London. This is higher than the Government’s legal minimum wage, which is currently £6.50 an hour. The Church of England has 72 care workers employed by its Pensions Board in supported housing schemes who are paid less than the living wage. It has promised that their pay will be raised to the Church’s recommended living wage level, but only gradually, ‘in stages’, and only from April onwards. The pressure on employers from the Archbishop to put workers onto the living wage now appears to contrast with the CofE’s lethargy about raising the low wages of its own staff. The Archbishop of York John Sentamu (left) called for solidarity to replace consumerism and individualism . Archbishop Welby said in his contribution to the book published last week, On Rock or Sand?, that there were not only ‘moral and economic arguments for paying a living wage but also a number of possible ways in which paying the living wage could have a positive multiplier effect in other aspects of life – including in educational attainment, health and family stability.’ Mr Davies, MP for Shipley, said that the Church should not be telling other businesses to do what it was not prepared to do itself. ‘There are many small businesses around the country that might have considerably more difficulty raising wages than the CofE,’ he said. ‘Archbishop Welby might want to take the log out of his own eye before he complains about the speck in everybody else’s.’ Economist Ruth Lea of the Arbuthnot Banking Group – herself an Anglican – said: ‘Businesses have to stick to the law and pay the minimum wage. Beyond that it has to be up to them what they pay people, according to what they can afford. ‘Businesses have to pay enough to keep staff and they have to look out for their staff. They have to decide what is sensible pay for themselves.’ A spokesman for Archbishop Welby said: ‘The Archbishop would want to see the workers paid the living wage as soon as feasibly possible.’","Archbishop of Canterbury said all employers should pay living wage .
The Church of England pays less to its own low-paid workers, however .
Living wage is set at £7.85 and £9.15 in London, with  at minimum wage at £6.50 ."
"Walking in groups does more than put a spring in your step – it cuts your risk of life-threatening disorders, say researchers. Stroke, coronary heart disease, depression and even cancer recurrence can be staved off through regular outdoor walking in groups, they found. Among the benefits are lower blood pressure, resting heart rate, blood cholesterol levels, body fat and Body Mass Index (BMI). Walking in groups cuts the risk of life-threatening disorders such as stroke and coronary heart disease (file image) Researchers at the University of East Anglia (UEA), who carried out a study, want doctors to recommend group walking as a regular tonic. Sarah Hanson and Professor Andy Jones of UEA’s Norwich Medical School carried out a review of 42 studies that looked at 1,843 participants in 14 countries, including a total of 74,000 hours of group walking. Sarah Hanson said ‘Our research suggests that by joining a group, people walk faster and further than they would normally walk. ‘It is one of the best and easiest ways to boost overall health. The benefits are wide ranging – and they go above and beyond making people more physically active.’ She said the psychological benefits and security found in group walking paid health dividends. ‘The merits of walking – including lowering the recurrence of some cancers – are well known, but these findings show that the dynamics and social cohesion of walking in groups may produce additional advantages. ‘People who walk in groups also tend to have a more positive attitude toward physical activity, a shared experience of wellness, and say they feel less lonely and isolated’ she added. Britons are advised to do 150 minutes a week of moderate activity such as gardening, dancing or brisk walking. Britons are advised to do 150 minutes a week of moderate activity such as gardening, dancing or brisk walking . But almost a third do less than 30 minutes exercise a week, and one in 10 doesn't manage to walk more than five minutes at a time over a month. The new study, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine (must credit), looked at walkers with obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, fibromyalgia, Parkinson’s disease, as well as healthy participants . The findings showed people who joined walking groups registered statistically significant falls in average blood pressure, resting heart rate, body fat, weight, and total cholesterol. Walkers also experienced improvements in lung power, overall physical functioning, and general fitness, and they were less depressed than before they started walking regularly. Evidence was less clear-cut for reductions in other risk factors for ill health, such as waist circumference, fasting blood glucose and blood fats. Three-quarters of all participants stuck with the group, and there were few side effects, apart from a handful of falls on roots or wet ground, and minor injuries such as calf strain. Sarah Hanson said people in groups get a sense of belonging, with some men and women enjoying the security. She said ‘People told us all the organising was done for them, they simply had to turn up. It becomes an obligation, habit-forming, which helps them stick at it. ‘Some men said if they go for a walk in the woods on their own with no dog their motives might be questioned.’ She said ‘These findings may provide clinicians with evidence of a further effective option to recommend to those patients who would benefit from increasing the amount of moderate-intensity physical activity they do.’ The ‘Walking for Health’ scheme, run by the Ramblers and Macmillan Cancer Support, is England’s largest network of outdoor group walks, with 70,000 regular walkers, 10,000 volunteer walk leaders and approximately 3,000 short walks offered every week around the country. Jackie Hayhoe, programme manager for Walking for Health, said ‘Walking really works. Every day we see the positive impact this simple activity has on the thousands of people who regularly take part in Walking for Health group walks. ‘We’re delighted to see further evidence to support what we see on the ground – that walking with others adds to the many health and well-being benefits regular walkers see. “As the evidence mounts, we’d like to see more local authorities, clinicians and public health professionals supporting and recommending walking groups in their local areas.’ j.hope@dailymail.co.uk .","Scientists found walking in groups reduced blood pressure and BMI .

"An eco-warrior who was convicted of masterminding a plot to blow up two federal facilities and had his 20-year sentence cut short because prosecutors failed to turn over all their evidence to defense lawyers has said he was entrapped by a female FBI informant for whom he harbored romantic feelings. Eric McDavid, 37, spent nine years in federal custody for what FBI agents alleged was as an eco-terrorist plot in the name of the Earth Liberation Front. In his first interview since his January 8 release from prison, the  Placer County resident told The Sacramento Bee that he is even more distrustful of the government now than he was before his 2006 arrest. Eric McDavid, 37, walks out of the Federal Courthouse in Sacramento, California, on January 8 after being released from prison after serving nearly nine years in federal custody . McDavid, 37, embraces his girlfriend Jenny Esquivel outside of the Federal Courthouse after being released. FBI agents had alleged was as an eco-terrorist plot in the name of the Earth Liberation Front . 'Nobody could ever get me my nine years back,' McDavid said in the interview. McDavid, pictured before his 2006 arrest, said he was ensnared by a female FBI informant . 'What was taken in those nine years, you can't get that back.' He told the paper that it was 'surreal' to be out of prison, and that he still felt that it was a dream. McDavid had been scheduled to stay in prison for another eight years, until February 2023. The same judge who presided at his trial ordered McDavid released based on the government's failure to turn over the evidence, which included emails and a love letter from McDavid to the undercover informant, who has been identified in court papers only as Anna. Defense attorneys say the communications would have bolstered their argument that McDavid was induced by sex. They also argued that the alleged conspiracy was hatched only at the prodding of the informant, who supplied money for bleach and other bomb-making supplies. Prosecutors have said the emails and letter were withheld inadvertently and would not have changed the outcome of his jury trial. McDavid pleaded guilty to a lesser charge this month as part of a plea deal in which he was sentenced to time served and also agreed not to sue the government. McDavid, however, insists he and two co-defendants who testified against him never planned to destroy a hydroelectric dam and a U.S. Forest Service genetics lab, as federal officials claimed. McDavid, right, listens to his mother, Eileen McDavid, left, and girlfriend, Jenny Esquivel, during an interview his parents' Foresthill, California home . 'No, we were not going to blow anything up,' McDavid told The Bee. ELF, which is also known as 'The Elves', is the collective name given to eco-warriors who engage in sabotage and guerilla tactics. It was founded in the UK in 1992 and has since spread through 17 countries. The collective was classed as a 'domestic terror' threat by the FBI in March 2001. Activists have been known to sabotage government facilities and private companies that engage in pursuits which 'exploit the earth' including logging companies, genetic engineering labs, SUV salesrooms and property developers. 'The Nimbus Dam stuff, that was her idea. That was Anna's idea.' He recounted the day he and the two co-defendants were arrested in a Kmart parking lot. He said he was loading parcels in the trunk of a car when he heard the door locks click closed and wondered why Anna was talking on a cellphone inside. 'And right then, there must have been around nine vehicles pull up screeching, doors opening before vehicles even stop. 'I got a Suburban about 15 yards off to my right, Ninja turtles jumping out, AR15s, everything,' he said. 'And I just go, ''Oh, that's what that was.''' McDavid said he is trying to figure out what his next steps will be. He is thinking about teaching yoga, a practice he learned in prison. 'I can bake,' he said. 'If you need bread for a thousand guys, or cakes or cookies or turnovers or doughnuts.' McDavid said that he never planned to blow up the Nimbus Dam in California and that it was the idea of his girlfriend, known only as 'Anna', who informed to the FBI .

"Scientists claim they have answered one of the biggest questions in geology; why do tectonic plates beneath the Earth's surface sometimes move abruptly? In a new study, US geologists believe the answer comes down to a combination of the thick crusts and weakened mineral grains. Those effects acting together, they say, could explain a range of relatively 'speedy' moves among tectonic plates around the world, from Hawaii to East Timor. Scroll down for video . Traditionally, scientists believed that all tectonic plates are pulled by subducting slabs - which result from the colder, top boundary layer of the Earth's rocky surface becoming heavy and sinking slowly into the deeper mantle. Pictured is a diagram of a coastal area where an ocean plate is subducting beneath a continental plate . 'Our planet is probably most distinctly marked by the fact that it has plate tectonics,' said Yale University geophysicist David Bercovici, lead author of the research. 'Our work here looks at the evolution of plate tectonics. How and why do plates change directions over time?' Traditionally, scientists believed that all tectonic plates are pulled by subducting slabs - which result from the colder, top boundary layer of the Earth's rocky surface becoming heavy and sinking slowly into the deeper mantle. Yet that process does not account for sudden plate shifts – which in geological terms is still a million years or longer. Thick crust from continents or oceanic plateaux is swept into the subduction zone prompting the slab to break off. The result is tectonic plates that abruptly shift horizontally, or continents suddenly bobbing up . Such abrupt movement requires that slabs detach from their plates, but doing this quickly is difficult since the slabs should be too cold and stiff to detach. According to the Yale study, there are additional factors at work. Thick crust from continents or oceanic plateaux is swept into the subduction zone, plugging it up and prompting the slab to break off. The detachment process is then accelerated when mineral grains in the necking slab start to shrink, causing the slab to weaken rapidly. The result is tectonic plates that abruptly shift horizontally, or continents suddenly bobbing up. 'Understanding this helps us understand how the tectonic plates change through the Earth's history,' Professor Bercovici said. 'It adds to our knowledge of the evolution of our planet, including its climate and biosphere.' Researchers say weak zones caused the Earth's mantle to crack, causing tectonic plates to form . They are responsible for the formation of continents, and are still active - as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions show. However, researchers have never been able to work out why the Earth developed tectonic plates, but other planets did not. But in April, they Yale said it had solved the mystery - and say the key is tiny minerals within rocks. The research suggests how and when Earth came to develop one of its most distinct features — rigid tectonic plates — and why Venus, Earth’s twin-like neighbor, never has. 'We think it all comes down to the behavior of tiny grains of minerals within rocks,' said Yale geophysicist David Bercovici, lead author of research published online April 6 in the journal Nature. The researchers argue that in Earth’s early days, mantle convection caused weak zones in the lithosphere - the outermost shell of the planet. These zones persisted, developed into plate boundaries, and ultimately connected to form a global network of tectonic plates. The weak zones, they argue, resulted from the tendency of mineral grains in rocks to shrink as the rock deforms.","Scientists have long been puzzled by Earth's sudden plate shifts .

But current models suggest the slabs are too cold and stiff to detach .
Instead, thick crust from continents are causing the slab to break off .

"A British tourist's outdoor romp in the Nevada desert ended in disaster after the excitement triggered a heart attack - landing him with a $250,000 medical bill. Peter Cousins, 55, was travelling the world with his partner Dawn Reed when they stopped to work on a cowboy ranch in the middle of the desert. The pair had been trekking and were miles from civilization when they came across the beautiful natural hot spring and decided to have an outdoor tryst. Scroll down for video . Brit Peter Cousins (right) was staying at a ranch in the Nevada desert Dawn Reed (left) when the pair saw a hot spring and decided to have a romantic tryst . But the romance was shattered when Mr Cousins suffered a cardiac arrest and collapsed. Around 60 miles from a phone signal, Ms Reed was forced to run three miles to flag down a trucker. Mr Cousins had to be airlifted to hospital where he underwent a life-saving operation. But the artist, who did not have any travel insurance, was in for another shock when he was presented with a staggering $250,000 medical bill for his five-day stay. If that wasn't bad enough, he was forced to return home and broke up with Dawn, who remained in the US to work. Despite his misfortune, Mr Cousins from Dorset, UK, insists his outdoor quickie was worth it. 'It was the most expensive sex ever,' he added. 'I haven't been able to pay it off and although it's always at the back of my mind, I have no regrets. 'Yes, I will never be able to forget that I owe so much money, but it was worth it for the sex. It's always worth it.' But the tryst ended in disaster when Mr Cousins suffered a heart attacks moments afterwards and had to be airlifted to hospital . Pictured at the Grand Canyon, the pair were 60 miles away from phone signal when Peter collapsed forcing Dawn to run three miles to flag down a trucker . Mr Cousins and his partner of two years Ms Reed were living in Portugal when they embarked on a round-the-world trip in April 2013. After months on the road the pair flew to America and started working as chefs on a cowboy ranch in the middle of the Nevada desert where they discovered the natural springs. Mr Cousins said: 'After we started working there, Dawn and I took a walk around and discovered these beautiful natural hot springs all over the place. 'We always used to sit in them and then one day we thought it would be romantic to make love in the pool. 'When I got up there were pains in my left arm and I just collapsed. 'We were miles from the ranch and even then, there was no phone signal to call anyone. I didn't know if I was going to make it, we were in the middle of nowhere. In hospital, pictured, Mr Cousins had life-saving stent placed in his heart, but after a five-day stay was presented with a staggering $250,000 medical bill . If that wasn't bad enough, he had to return home and broke up with Dawn (who he is pictured with at the ranch in Nevada where they were staying) who had to stay and work in the US . 'It was astounding how remote it was. There was no internet or cellular signal for miles and the nearest town was more than three hours drive away.' Ms Reed had no choice but to leave her partner alone while she flagged down the trucker who called the air ambulance on a satellite phone. Two hours later Mr Cousins was airlifted to hospital and had a life-saving stent placed in his heart. But after a five-day stay in Reno hospital he almost suffered another heart attack when medics hit him with a bill for a quarter of a million dollars - or £165,000. He said: 'When I woke up I was in A and E. Doctors fitted a stent and gave me lots of drugs to keep me alive. I was in there for five days before being discharged. 'As I was leaving the doctors asked me how I planned on paying the bill. I was thinking it would be around $5,000 but couldn't believe it when it all amounted to $250,000.' Happier times: The couple were travelling the world together before the incident . But Mr Cousins (left, in Reno) said his outdoor quickie with Ms Reed (right) was worth it insisting he had 'no regrets' Unable to pay the bill, Mr Cousins travelled back to the UK for further treatment while Dawn stayed on the ranch, and the couple split in October 2014, but remain friends. Mr Cousins is still negotiating with the hospital over the bill. He added: 'I'm just really hoping I will be able to get the debt wiped because it will affect my future. 'If the hospital decide I do have to pay back the full amount, I'll never be able to go to America again. That will hurt. 'Stupidly, I didn't have travel insurance and although I was expecting a big bill I had to do a double take when I saw it was a quarter of a million dollars. 'I was completely gobsmacked. I wasn't working at the time as Dawn and I had been travelling the world, so there was no way I could ever afford that. 'It's bizarre how things have turned out. I would be really upset if this meant I could never enter the country again.'","Peter Cousins, 55, was travelling the world with then-partner Dawn Reed .

"Thousands of jobless Brits living in Europe could be forced to return home under David Cameron's plan to reform EU welfare rules. Downing Street yesterday warned that proposals to clamp down on so-called 'benefit tourists' would apply to unemployed British citizens living elsewhere in the European Union as well as EU migrants living here. New research yesterday revealed that more than 30,000 British nationals are claiming unemployment and related benefits in countries around the EU. An estimated 65,000 EU citizens claim similar benefits in the UK. Scroll down for video . New research yesterday revealed that more than 30,000 British nationals are claiming unemployment and related benefits in countries around the EU . But Downing Street yesterday confirmed that they would also be affected by the Prime Minister's plan to curb migration from the EU by clamping down on benefits. Under Mr Cameron's proposals, which were unveiled in November, EU citizens would face deportation if they failed to find a job within six months of moving to the UK. They would also be prevented from claiming in-work benefits in this country for four years. The Prime Minister's Official Spokesman told reporters that Brits living abroad could expect to face a similar clampdown if he succeeds in his bid to change the EU's rules ahead of an In/Out referendum on Europe planned for 2017. 'The Prime Minister is seeking a number of changes to welfare rules linked to immigration.' The spokesman told reporters. 'There would be reciprocal changes across the EU.' The Conservatives argue that curbing welfare will reduce the 'pull factors' that attract some EU citizens to come to Britain. Mr Cameron chose to pursue this route after German Chancellor Angela Merkel vetoed plans to directly curb the EU principle of free movement of people. The decision to pursue a policy that will apply to unemployed Brits as well as EU citizens could result in a double benefit for the Conservatives, who have failed to deliver on Mr Cameron's pledge to cut net immigration to below 100,000 a year, as returning UK citizens would also count towards the target. Under Mr Cameron's proposals, which were unveiled in November, EU citizens would face deportation if they failed to find a job within six months of moving to the UK . But critics are likely to question the economic value of forcing thousands of unemployed British citizens to return to this country to sign on. The revelation follows new research by the Guardian newspaper yesterday revealing the extent of EU benefit tourism. The study, based on responses from 23 of the EU's other 27 member states, suggests that more than 30,000 UK citizens are claiming unemployment benefits elsewhere in Europe. More than a third of the total, some 11,222, live in Ireland, with the rest concentrated in Germany, France, Spain and Italy. The number of Brits claiming benefits in these countries is higher than the number of their citizens on the dole here. But the situation in many other EU countries is very different. The research suggests some 14,880 Polish citizens are claiming Jobseekers' Allowance (JSA) in the UK, compared with just two British citizens claiming similar benefits in Poland. Some 4,880 Lithuanians claim JSA in Britain, while no British citizens at all are on the dole in Lithuania. The study also found that no British citizens are claiming unemployment benefits in Romania, while 1,040 Romanians are on JSA here. Other countries with large numbers of citizens claiming JSA in the UK include Slovakia, Portugal and the Czech Republic. In total they have almost 17,500 citizens on the benefit. By contrast, just 261 Brits are on the dole in these three countries. In total, the study found that about 65,000 EU citizens are claiming JSA in the UK.","PM says plans to cut down on 'benefit tourists' apply to jobless Brits in EU .

"A grandmother says she was left 'looking like a monster' after a reaction to a lip gloss caused her lips to blister and break out in pus-filled sores. Doctors thought Lynda Roberts, 62, from Salford, had developed a viral condition after huge cold sore-like lesions covered her lips. Her lips began to tingle then blister - and later burst and crack. Mrs Roberts says she felt 'ugly and dirty' and missed her 40th wedding anniversary because she couldn't face leaving the house. Lynda Roberts, 62, suffered an allergic reaction to her Dior Addict lip gloss which caused her lips to blister, break out in pus-filled sores, and crack. She is pictured now (left) and after (the reaction) Doctors thought Mrs Roberts had a virus causing her lips to crack, and she tried different medications to treat her painful lips (pictured left and right). She said she felt 'ugly and dirty' and missed her 40th wedding anniversary as she couldn't face leaving the house . The grandmother-of-four, who works in a doctor's surgery, never suspected her Dior Addict lip gloss was to blame, having used the product before. After trying a plethora of different medicines, Mrs Roberts decided to stop using her 'Dolly Pink' lip gloss in case it made it worse – and was amazed when her 'viral condition' disappeared. But after months of agony it emerged the French cosmetics firm had changed the formula – adding a preservative called propyl gallate in the new tube Mrs Roberts' daughter had bought for her. Dior then arranged for her to have tests with a dermatologist which revealed the allergy to propyl gallate, a preservative used to stop cosmetics reacting with oxygen and fats in food. The company has since sent her a letter apologising for the 'inconvenience' and a free candle – and at Mrs Roberts' request donated her refund to charity. Mrs Roberts, a mother-of-two, said: 'It's a bit more than an inconvenience – and a candle just doesn't cut it. 'I missed my 40th wedding anniversary because I looked like a monster and just didn't want to go out. 'It made me look ugly and dirty, especially when it went into black scabs. 'I think other people should know about propyl gallate because it can cause such a severe reaction.' Propyl Gallate is a preservative used in a wide range of cosmetics and beauty care products, including lipsticks, bath products, skin cleansing products, moisturisers, skin care products, makeup, self-tanning products, and sun cream. It is also used in foods like meat products, microwaveable popcorn, soup, chewing gum, mayonnaise and frozen meals. It has antioxidant properties, which means it helps stop oxygen molecules from mixing with the oil in food, causing the food to go rancid. In cosmetic products, it stops the oxygen mixing with the oil, which could change the colour and texture of the product, or cause the active ingredients in the formula to deteriorate. Christian Dior said in a statement: 'Consumer safety is our main priority. All cosmetic products placed on the European market are regulated by strict EU laws (the Cosmetic Products Regulations EC No 1223/2009). 'Propyl gallate is not on the prohibited list nor is its use restricted in cosmetics. 'It is not carcinogenic. It is a food additive (E310). 'We were sorry to learn of our consumer's condition and were grateful that she had taken the time to return the product for analysis. 'Cases like these are fed into the industry scientific bodies to continue to inform research and regulation of this industry.' Dr Christopher Flower,  director general of the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association (CTPA), the industry body that represent cosmetics firms, said: 'Unfortunately, even with such comprehensive safeguards, it is not possible to avoid all possibility that someone somewhere might react to one of the ingredients. 'Such reactions are rare but nevertheless of concern and distressing for those affected. 'This does not mean the product is unsafe but it does mean that anyone who has reacted to a product and knows which ingredient caused that reaction must avoid the same ingredient in any other cosmetic product as well. 'This can be checked by consulting the ingredient list that must be available either on the label or, for small products, at the point of sale.' Mrs Roberts had used Dior Addict lip gloss for years, but the company recently added propyl gallate - a preservative used in cosmetics - to the formula, which triggered an allergic reaction . The news comes after MailOnline reported the case of Karen Mooney, 52, who was left with red sores all over her face after using expensive beauty products from Clarins. Ms Mooney's skin began breaking out in welts after regularly using Clarins products, such as the Lait Demaquillant Cleansing Milk and Extra-Firming Day Cream. The dating agency boss from Surrey had been using Clarins products for cleansing and moisturising for two decades. It was discovered she had an allergy to methylisothiazolinone (MI), a preservative in the Clarins creams. The preservative was first approved for use in skincare in 2005. Two studies presented at the British Association of Dermatologists’ conference in 2013 showed a sharp rise in reactions to MI over the past three years.

The Australian Federal Police say the change is a result of intelligence and discussions with its partners, and is in line with the broader threat level for the community. 'Recent events in France, Canada and Australia serve as a sobering reminder of the risks associated with policing,' the AFP said. Scroll down for video . The Australian Federal Police say the change is a result of intelligence and discussions with its partners, and is in line with the broader threat level for the community . 'While relatively small, there are increasing numbers of Australians who are connected with or inspired by overseas terrorist groups such as the Islamic State ... with the intent and capability to conduct an attack against police.' Australia's general terrorism threat level was raised in September. Queensland Police Commissioner Ian Stewart said he had sent emails to his officers as well as their families to tell them about what the new threat level meant for them and ease their minds. 'I have taken the action that mirrors what I did back in September. I have reminded all officers the need to be aware of environment around them as well as their personal safety, and the safety of their family and loved ones,' he said. Mr Stewart said there had been no direct threats made to police officers or staff members. 'Because of previous events and now world events, that level does go up to high,' Mr Stewart said. Recent events, such as the Martin Place siege (police are pictured above removing items from the Sydney scene), have contributed to raising the threat level to officers . The police commissioner pointed to a recent incident in France where a police station was attacked as an example of what was taken into account when making the change in the threat level. He said the public would not see much change in the community as police had already taken steps to ramp up operations following the G20 summit and the elevation of the nationwide terror threat in September. 'In real terms what the security assessment is saying is that we must take cognisance of what has occurred overseas,' Mr Stewart said. 'There have been instances there was one in France where a police station was attacked and officers have been attacked in the street – not necessarily by terrorists.'","Terrorism threat level for Australian police has been elevated from medium .

"An engagement ring designed to look like the infamous Golden Snitch featured in JK Rowling's Harry Potter series has proven so popular that its creator has had to close down her online store in order to fill her existing orders. Orders for jewelry designer Miranda Scott's Snitch ring have been flying in in recent weeks, with demand increasing so quickly that the Ontario-based store, which is hosted on online marketplace Etsy, was forced to close down. 'Due to the popularity of the Buzzfeed article on my Snitch ring, I have had a huge surge in orders and messages, and I need time to answer all of them,' Ms Scott wrote on the Alchemy House page. Scroll down for video . The perfect ring: Miranda Scott's Golden Snitch-themed engagement bling has proved so popular she has had to close down her online store in order to fill her existing orders . Go for gold: The ring is available in sterling silver, yellow or white gold, with each ring featuring a golden topaz, which represents the Snitch's body . 'At this point it is looking like the turnover time on the rings will be increased to 4-5 weeks, and I am also not taking rush orders.' Ms Scott added that she hopes to re-open her store in 'a few days', but stressed that orders for the popular engagement rings would take a lot longer than usual to fill. 'I can no longer guarantee delivery before Valentine's Day, and rush orders are not being taken for earlier than that date,' she added. Marketed as the ultimate 'geeky' engagement ring for fans of the literary series, the romantic bling features a golden topaz as the main stone, which is designed to represent the Snitch's round body, while the band - which is available in sterling silver, yellow or white gold - is supposed to represent its wings. 'At this ring, have a look, it was inspired by a book,' the Alchemy House page describes. 'If you're a wizard or witch, you could use it to get hitched. In gold or silver it may be bought, but official merchandise, it is not. 'Allow 3-4 weeks for me to make it for you, and JK Rowling, if you're reading this - please don't sue.'

Keep your eye on the Snitch: The impossibly fast mechanical creation is one of the key elements of Quidditch, a competitive team sport played by the wizards in Harry Potter . The Golden Snitch was first introduced to readers in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the first in the seven-strong series of books. Described by author JK Rowling in the book as 'wicked fast, and damn near impossible to see', the Snitch is then revealed to be one of the key elements of the game of Quidditch, a competitive team sport loved by wizards the world over. The once-fictional game, which has since been transformed into its own national sport in the US, only comes to an end when the Snitch has been caught by one team's Seeker, an achievement which then earns that team 150 points. And it's not just Harry Potter fans that are being forced to wait for their themed accessories; Alchemy House also boasts a collection of rings inspired by popular video game The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. The sapphire Zora ring, the ruby Goron ring and the emerald Kokiri rings are all currently unavailable while Ms Scott fills her existing orders for the Snitch ring.","The $145 band was created by Canadian jewelry designer Miranda Scott .

"As shark sightings and beach closures continue across the country, swimmers have found another way to keep themselves entertained on the sand. Selfies have emerged on social media of the fearless and brave beachgoers posing in front of a shark warning sign looking seemingly happy as they smile for the cameras. It comes after hundreds of swimmers were forced to dash for the shores at Manly and North Steyne beaches on the Northern Beaches of Sydney after a shark was spotted in the water on Sunday. Instagram photographs show beachgoers and local residents posing alongside the ‘Shark sighted today – Enter the water at your own risk’ signs as they strike a pose. Scroll down for video . One woman was spotted looking afraid and screaming for help in front of the warning sign. She captions: 'Hanging with the sharks of oz. #sharksighting #manlybeach #straya #aintskeerd' Despite the warning, a young boy posted a selfie with a caption saying that he still entered while other swimmers were spotted in the background casually enjoying their day in the water. One woman shared a cheeky photograph of herself with the warning sign in the back, as she appears to look afraid and it seems she was screaming, presumably for help. Others smiled happily as they pointed at the sign to capture the moment while others said the shark scare didn't stop them from entering the water. The selfie craze follows as a procession of sharks alerted swimmers and surfers out of the water at the weekend as beachgoers continue to upload their selfies of the sign as a keepsake. Not even a shark sighting deterred one man from entering the water.

While Newcastle beaches have reopened on Monday after being closed for a record of 10 consecutive days following the sighting of a great white shark off the coast. A five metre shark was first spotted off Merewether beach on January 10, prompting the closure of all six beaches across the coastline of NSW as several jet skis and speed boats scoured the water. Several other sharks, including tiger sharks feeding on dolphins were seen along the coast but authorities have reopened the beaches after jetski patrols found no sign of the sea creatures. Last Friday, a 17-year-old boy was bitten on the hand by a shark after he went spearfishing off Mollymook beach on the South Coast of NSW.

"An 84-year-old nun who broke into a U.S. nuclear facility in an act of protest, now shares a jail cell with 111 other women. In 2012, Sister Megan Rice, and two other activists from the Plowshares anti-nuclear organisation - Michael Walli, 63, and Gregory Boertje-Obed, 57 - broke into the Y-12 Oak Ridge nuclear facility outside Knoxville, Tennessee. The group, there to protest against the proliferation of nuclear facilities, first hung large banners on the facility's fence, before using bolt cutters to cut their way inside. Something that took just seven minutes. Sister Megan Rice, Michael Walli, (middle) and Gregory Boertje-Obed broke into the Y-12 Oak Ridge nuclear facility in 2012; the trip are seen above in February 2013 following a court appearance . Sister Megan was sentenced to 35 months jail for interfering with national security and damaging property and her co-defendants were sentenced to 62 months each; the trio were also ordered to $52,000 in damages . Once inside the trio walked to the building undetected and sprayed quotes from the Bible such as 'Swords into plowshares' and splashed a vial of human blood on the wall. They then banged on the building with hammers and waited to be arrested. Sister Megan was sentenced to 35 months jail for interfering with national security and damaging property and her co-defendants were sentenced to 62 months each. The trio were also ordered to $52,000 in damages. The nun, who spent 40 years teaching in the poorest parts of Africa before returning to the U.S due to Malaria, now resides at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center. Her cell is a gymnasium-sized dorm with 60 bunkbeds, shared between 111 women. There are six toilet stalls and six showers. In the centre of the room, there is seating for 60 women but no outdoor courtyard or mess hall. But instead of complaining about the conditions, Sister Megan instead told the New York Daily News of her admiration for her cellmates whose 'patience and endurance' is a 'constant source of admiration and hope'. Sister Megan now resides at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center; her jail cell is a gymnasium-sized dorm room with 60 bunkbeds, shared between 111 women and has only six toilet stalls . The Y-12 Nuclear Facility houses 100,000 tons of highly enriched uranium, which is a bomb-grade explosive . At the age of 82, Sister Megan embarrassed authorities by showing just how easy it was to break into a federal facility undetected. The Y-12 Nuclear Facility houses 100,000 tons of highly enriched uranium, which is a bomb-grade explosive. If a grapefruit-sized chunk of the uranium was dropped onto another chunk from just six feet, the newspaper reports, that it could cause an explosion at least half the size of Hiroshima. Sister Megan told the newspaper that she knew she would be jailed for breaking into the nuclear facility but that she believed it was the responsibility of people without children to take the risks that others can't. She said:  'The question - how can we overcome the secrecy and blatant distortion of the truth of the horrific risks to planet Earth's survival as we know it as long as we fail to transform the nuclear weapons and energy industries into possible, life-enhancing alternatives, and begin with dismantlement now? We are all equally responsible to stop known crimes, according to our unique gifts and abilities.' Other inmates at the federal lock-up where Sister Megan resides include suspected Al Qaeda terrorist Abid Naseer, and Ross Ulbricht, who is alleged to be behind the black market drugs and guns website Silk Road. Sister Megan is due to be released in November.","Sister Megan Rice and two others broke into a nuclear facility in 2012 .

"A woman tragically paralyzed during her own bachelorette party has announced she and her husband are expecting a girl, thanks to an old friend who agreed to carry her baby. Rachelle Friedman, 28, said on her Facebook page she was 'so excited to meet our sweet princess' with the baby expected to be born in April. Mrs Friedman, who is quadriplegic, is being given a helping hand to have her by college friend Laurel Humes who will act as a surrogate. Scroll down for video . Rachelle Friedman (left), who has been paralyzed since 2010, announced on her Facebook page that she and her husband Chris (right) are expecting a girl in April . Mrs Friedman, pictured with the book that tells the story of her life, injury and recovery, will be a mother thanks to her surrogate . Friend in need: Humes and Friedman knew one another in college and now Mrs Humes is going to carry Friedman's child for her . The delighted mother-to-be admitted she shed a few tears of happiness when she made the announcement and is starting to pick out baby names. Mrs Friedman had said previously she was hoping for a girl. Mrs Friedman's life was dramatically altered in 2010 when she was paralysed after being pushed in a pool by one of her friends at her bachelorette party. Tragically, she fell too close to the shallow end of the pool and broke her neck. After a year, Mrs Friedman tied the knot to fiance Chris Chapman and the pair were anxious to start a family, beginning a campaign to raise $60,000 to pay for a surrogate. Their prayers were answered in June last year when Laurel Humes, 31, a friend of Mrs Friedman's from college, volunteered to carry Chris and Rachelle's child. Miracle of life: Friedman shared online the first ultrasound images showing her baby developing in her friend's womb . They're expecting: Mrs Friedman posted a picture of herself (center), husband Chris (right) and surrogate Mrs Humes (left) Overjoyed: Friedman's eggs were harvested and in July, the fertilized embryos were implanted in Humes . Doctors retrieved Friedman's eggs and transferred the fertilized embryos into Humes in July. Soon after, Mrs Friedman shared a picture of herself, husband Chris and Mrs Humes and wrote: 'Crossing our fingers she's pregnant right now.' The wait paid off, with Mrs Friedman announcing in August she was going to be a mother and posting a picture of her surrogate's scan. 'First family photo,' she wrote. 'We are going to have a baby!!' she wrote. 'Due date? April 19th. We are elated.' 'I never cry...ever. But I may have shed a few tears of happiness here!' Mrs Friedman, who also shares on her blog babychapman.com, had been ecstatic when doctors told her after the catastrophic injury, she would be able to bear children. But her joy quickly turned to sorry when she discovered that medications she would be required to take her her blood pressure can be dangerous when pregnant. The 28-year-old and her husband launched a crowdfunding campaign in May in a bid to raise money for the procedure, which can cost up to $120,000 a fetus. Their prayers were unexpectedly answered just weeks after setting up their page. After reading a post on Friedman's blog about needing a surrogate, Humes, a stay-at-home mother of one, knew she wanted to help. Exicited for the future: The 28-year-old wife and soon-to-be mother has been anxious for her friend to get pregnant with her baby . Mother-to-be: Rachelle Friedman and husband Chris Chapman, leave their 2011 wedding reception . Just weeks before her wedding, Mrs Friedman had been at her bachelorette party with her bridesmaids when one of her friends playfully pushed her in the pool, breaking her neck and leaving her paralyzed . Mr Chapman said:  'She said she'd already been . looking into surrogacy and wanted to help us start a family.' His overjoyed wife added: 'It's amazing, it wouldn't be possible without her. Surrogacy is astronomically expensive, it's crazy.' Despite her joy, Mrs Friedman admitted she had faced some discrimination after announcing she wanted children and said: 'A lot of . people . . .  don't think someone in a wheelchair can be a mother, that . I'm not physically able to take care of a kid but people underestimate . my abilities.' Mrs Friedman and Mr Chapman pictured before the accident in 2010  that changed both of their lives . Mrs Friedman, pictured on her wedding day, is biologically able to have children but her medications would be harmful to a fetus . Hopes and dreams: 'I want a child more than anything,' she tweeted in May . 'I broke my neck upon impact, became paralyzed from the chest down and would never walk again,' she told xoJane.com. It took two-and-a-half months of intensive physical therapy for Friedman to rebuild her upper body strength and regain movement in her arms and fingers. Instead . of resenting her friend, however, Friedman chose to keep her name . secret from the press, in order to prevent them from hounding her and . making her feel guiltier than she already did. 'She . is and will always be one of the my closest friends,' she stated, . explaining that her decision to keep her friend's identity a secret is . something she never once questioned. 'It's not our sisterly bond that keeps . me from saying her name in interviews,' she wrote. 'It's the fact that . she's a human being.' Friedman also revealed that the friend who pushed her into the pool has been instrumental in her journey towards motherhood. 'I feel very grateful to have her support and love,' she wrote. Friedman has published a book, The Promise: A Tragic Accident, a Paralyzed Bride, and the Power of Love, Loyalty, and Friendship , which delves into her life before and after she became paralyzed.","Rachelle Friedman has announced she is expecting a girl on Facebook .

"A deadly tropical sea snail uses a super-potent form of insulin to subdue its fish prey, scientists have discovered. The geographic cone snail (conus geographus) uses the chemical to cause a plunge in blood sugar, leaving the fish sluggish and unable to swim to safety. In this way the snail is able to entrap whole schools of small fish. C. geographus is one of the most venomous creatures on Earth, and known to have killed dozens of people in accidental encounters. C. geographus is one of the most venomous creatures on Earth, and known to have killed dozens of people in accidental encounters. It hunts in two ways, both by releasing toxins into the water and by firing a harpoon-like poison-tipped tooth into its prey.No antidote exists for a cone snail sting, which contains a mixture of nerve agents. The new research has uncovered one highly unusual ingredient in the cone snail's venom cocktail - weaponised insulin. In tests, a synthetic version of the hormone - made from shorter protein chains than normal insulin - lowered the blood sugar levels of adult zebrafish. Injected into water, it also reduced the movements of fish larvae. US scientist Professor Baldomero Olivera, from the University of Utah, said: 'This is a unique type of insulin. It is shorter than any insulin that has been described in any animal. 'We found it in the venom in large amounts.' The insulin forms part of a poison mixture evocatively known as 'nirvana cabal'. Adding the hormone to its armoury of toxins allows the snail to disable entire schools of swimming fish by sending them into hypoglycaemic shock - a condition brought on by plummeting blood sugar levels. The type of insulin, while stripped down, matches that found in fish, the scientists learned. A second cone snail species that practised fish-netting, Conus tulipa, was also found to have insulin in its venom. Other species that only operate as ambush hunters did not possess the insulin toxin, and nor did others that prey on molluscs or worms. Writing in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers concluded: 'Evolving insulin to be used as a pharmacological weapon presents a novel and unexpected type of event in chemical biology. There are about 30 recorded instances of people being killed by cone snails, some of which have attractive and collectible shells. 'Our study reveals a class of insulins that have evolved to act rapidly and potently to cause severe hypoglycaemia.' The snail insulin could prove to be a useful tool for probing systems the human body uses to control blood sugar and energy metabolism, they said. There are about 30 recorded instances of people being killed by cone snails, some of which have attractive and collectible shells. The molluscs are aggressive if provoked and their poison-loaded harpoons can penetrate wetsuits. While the sting of small cone snails is no worse than that of a bee, larger species can produce a serious and potentially fatal reaction.","C. geographus is one of the most venomous creatures on Earth .

"Labour has been accused of a ‘shameful’ attempt to scare parents into thinking their young children will not get a place at school in September. Furious Education Secretary Nicky Morgan told MailOnline parents deserved better than ‘scare stories’ peddled by Labour politicians putting their own interests before those of the country’s children. It comes after Labour’s Tristram Hunt claimed there was a ‘crippling’ shortage of places, despite the government committing £7billion for increasing school sizes over the next six years. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan told MailOnline parents deserved better than ‘scare stories’ about school places . Parents had until last Thursday to apply for children to start primary school in the autumn, naming at least three schools where they want to send their child. Mr Hunt used the deadline to launch an attack on the government in an article for MailOnline, claiming many families will be left disappointed, with pupils forced to travel further or squeeze into over-crowded classrooms. He highlighted figures suggesting 18 per cent of schools said they did not have enough capacity for their pupils. ‘This year's primary school admissions process is complicated by a crippling shortage in places that will leave many parents disappointed,’ he claimed. It came after the Local Government Association warned schools could be pushed to breaking point over the next decade, with almost a million more places for pupils needed. Official figures show that by 2023 there will be a total of 4.7million primary age pupils, up from 4.3million in 2014 . But Mrs Morgan condemned both Mr Hunt and the LGA for using ‘the anxieties of parents’ to score political points. In an article for MailOnline, she said: ‘Robust debate in politics is fine. It’s what we politicians expect. ‘But I believe a healthy debate should be based on facts rather than scaremongering or special pleading. ‘At a time when parents and children should be looking forward with excitement to taking their first steps in education, they deserve better than to be exposed to scare stories peddled by those who seek to put their own interests before those of our nation’s children.’ She said it was ‘shameful’ that Mr Hunt had the ‘cheek’ to criticse the coalition, after Labour’s poor record on school places. Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt claimed many families will be left disappointed, with pupils forced to travel further or squeeze into over-crowded classrooms . Mr Hunt had ignored the fact that Labour cut funding for school places and took 200,000 primary school places out of the system. She added that Labour did this ‘in the middle of a baby boom and at the same time as letting immigration get out of control’. She said the government had already put an extra £5billion in providing ‘good school places’ in this Parliament, with a further £7billion for new places over the next six years. And she insisted the Tories would focus on improving the quality of schools, adding that under Labour a third of children left primary school ‘unable to read, write or add up properly and Britain stagnated in international school league tables while the rest of the world moved on’. Official figures predict that there may be around 900,000 extra pupils in England's schools over the next decade. Nicky MOrgan says the government has already put an extra £5 billion into providing good school places in this parliament and more has been allocated for the years to come . This is always a difficult and anxious time of year for those parents with children starting school in September. With the passing of the application deadline, some fear they may not be granted the place they desperately want, while others are left wondering if they’ve made the right choice at all. I’ve been there. I know what it’s like. And that’s why I think it’s such a shame that some have chosen to use . to play on and exacerbate those concerns simply to push their own political agendas. In the past week the Local Government Association – an organisation that according to its own website exists to ‘promote’ the interests of local councils – claimed that without a dramatic increase in funding for local authorities the country faces a ‘crisis’ in school places. The LGA, of course, ignored the fact that this government changed the system so that it picks up almost all of the bill for providing school places on behalf of councils who have the legal duty to do so. We have already put an extra £5 billion into providing good school places in this parliament and more has been allocated for the years to come. Of course, it is the LGA’s job to lobby on behalf of its members. I understand that. But it is a shame to use the anxieties of parents as peg on which to do so. It is more shameful still when done by elected politicians in positions of responsibility, like the Labour Party’s education spokesman. Ignoring the fact that his government slashed funding for school places; overlooking the uncomfortable truth that the last Labour government took 200,000 primary school places out of the system; and neglecting to mention that they did this in the middle of a baby boom and at the same time as letting immigration get out of control, Tristram Hunt had the cheek last week to criticise this government for failing to do enough. I think some facts might be in order. Firstly, one of the first decisions this government took was to double the funding allocated to creating new school places. As a result, local authorities have been able to more than make up for Labour’s cuts by creating 260,000 new places since 2010. We have also funded more than 250 new free schools that are providing essential and high-quality school places in communities across the country. 70 per cent of these have been established in areas where there is an essential need for extra capacity, and a third have been targeted to provide good school places in some of the most deprived areas of the country. The government has also allocated a further £7 billion for new school places over the next six years as part of our sensible, planned approach that has replaced the chaos of the Labour years. 90 per cent of the new places required for September of this year are already in place or underway. How do we know? Because this government introduced a basic need monitoring process that allows us to plan effectively. The coalition has funded more than 250 new free schools that are providing 'essential and high-quality school places in communities across the country',  Mrs Morgan added . As a result, parents can be confident that there will be a school place available for their child when they need it. Under the last Labour government, no such monitoring took place. But that is not the limit of our ambitions. While guaranteeing every child the school place they need is vital, it’s also important to focus on quality. I want every child to have the chance to go to a good or outstanding local school where standards are high and discipline in strong. Fortunately, as a result of our plan for education, a million more children are learning in good or outstanding schools today than when we came to office. In fact, we now have more children in good or outstanding schools than ever before. Contrast that with the record of the last Labour government. Under them, a third of children left primary school unable to read, write or add up properly and Britain stagnated in international school league tables while the rest of the world moved on. All of this progress has only been possible because this government took the difficult decisions necessary to get the economy back on track. It’s because of this that we have been able to protect the schools budget in this parliament, spend an extra £5 billion on school places, and invest £18 billion to improve school buildings across the country - more than double the amount Labour spent in its first two terms combined. That’s what our long-term economic plan means for education, and we must stick to the course. Labour’s chaotic plans would mean more borrowing and more debt than our children and grandchildren could ever pay off. They have already announced £1.8 billion of spending commitments in education alone, yet have consistently refused to answer questions about how they would pay for them. Robust debate in politics is fine. It’s what we politicians expect. But I believe a healthy debate should be based on facts rather than scaremongering or special pleading. At a time when parents and children should be looking forward with excitement to taking their first steps in education, they deserve better than to be exposed to scare stories peddled by those who seek to put their own interests before those of our nation’s children.","Education Secretary Nicky Morgan hits back at Labour's dire warnings .

"It's been a tough six months for oil tycoon Harold Hamm: Not only did he sign away $975 million to his ex-wife following a bitter divorce battle, but he also lost half of his billion-dollar fortune. Hamm's company, Continental Resources Inc., has lost $9.2billion since June 2014, slicing his $18.5 billion net worth in half. A judge ruled in November that Oklahoma native Hamm, 69, also owed his former wife, Sue Ann Arnall nearly $1 billion in a divorce settlement and earlier this month cut her a handwritten check for the entire amount. Scroll down for video . Oil tycoon Harold Hamm, pictured with his wife Sue Ann Arnall in 2012, has lost half his billion-dollar fortune to divorce and falling oil prices in the past six months . Hamm's company, Continental Resources Inc, has lost have its value in six months since June 2014 due to falling oil prices . In November, an Oklahoma court ordered the CEO to pay his ex-wife close to $1 billion in cash and assets when the couple divorced after a 26-year marriage. And despite the fact she cashed the check, Ms Arnall, 56, has said she is still planning an appeal. At the Oklahoma Supreme Court, she claimed that the earlier ruling allowed Hamm to keep the vast majority of a marital estate. 'I will not dismiss my appeal and do not feel that my right to appeal should be denied because I have accepted, in the interim, a small portion of the estate that we built over more than two decades,' Arnall said in a statement through her lawyers. The couple never signed a prenuptial agreement. Continental has said the divorce award, one of the largest in U.S. history, has no impact on its business or operations. 'As we have said all along, there will be no change of control in the company,' said spokeswoman Kristin Thomas. The Hamm divorce has been ongoing since 2012 and last month, Hamm pledged to appeal the decision, after a sharp fall in oil prices cut billions from his personal fortune. Last week, Continental Resources Inc said that Hamm had pledged about one-fourth of the company shares he owns as collateral for a personal loan, according to a regulatory filing. The shares Hamm posted as collateral are worth $2.6 billion and represent an 18.5 per cent chunk in the Oklahoma-based drilling giant. Hamm could be forced to offer more collateral for the loan if the value of his company falls again. Hamm pledged 68.7 million of his Continental shares as collateral for a personal loan on January 9, according to a January 13 Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing. Harold Hamm penned this check to his ex-wife last month for $974.8 million following their two-year divorce battle in Oklahoma . The document did not state the purpose nor the terms of the loan, how much Hamm borrowed or who lent him the money. Hamm will need to pledge additional shares if the price of Continental stock falls below the 'minimum value requirements' of the loan, the company said without offering specifics. Hamm owns nearly 253 million shares, or 68 per cent of his firm. He will keep voting rights over the shares posted as collateral, the firm said. Hamm's personal borrowing won't damage the company or other shareholders unless Continental shares continue to fall sharply on lower oil prices, said one energy analyst. The shares have lost more than half of their value over the last four months. 'An issue could arise at some point,' said Leo Mariani of RBC Capital Markets in New York. 'If oil prices fall he would have to pledge a much greater portion of his company. He could lose those shares and they could be sold at depressed prices.' Along with her multimillion-dollar settleent, Ms Arnell was awarded the couple's second Oklahoma home located in Nichols Hill and worth $4.6million . Ms Arnall picked up three properties in the divorce, including the family home in Enid, Oklahoma . That risk is low, Mariani said, because oil prices are unlikely to fall much further or to remain low for years. U.S. benchmark crude oil has been trading below $50 a barrel, down from around $100 a barrel six months ago. Hamm had humble beginnings, growing up in rural Oklahoma where he was the 13th child of Oklahoma cotton sharecroppers. He founded Continental in 1967. He has already paid his former wife more than $20 million during the divorce proceedings. Ms Arnall has taken ownership of the Oak Ridge Ranch in Carmel, California, a property purchased by the couple in 2011 for $14.7million, along with the couple's two of their Oklahoma properties, as per the court's ruling. Hamm will take their $750,000 home in Branson, Missouri and a $300,000 log cabin that sits on 154 acres in Major County, Oklahoma. Harold Hamm's oil company has lost 50 per cent of its value in the past six months due to plummeting prices .","Hamm's company, Continental Resources Inc., has lost $9.2 billion - half its value - since June 2014 .

"Drama teacher Simon Parsons, 52, (pictured) had a long-term affair with a pupil and even had a child with the girl, but his wife is standing by him . The wife of a teacher who embarked on a five-year affair with a pupil of 17 has vowed to stand by him, insisting: ‘He is not a monster.’ Drama master Simon Parsons, 52, had sex with the girl in school and at his home during the ‘immoral’ relationship – and she later had his baby. But despite the deceit, his wife of 12 years has pleaded with a judge to show leniency when he is sentenced today. ‘He is a gentle man who made a massive mistake,’ she said in a statement read in court. Parsons is said to have met the girl when she was 13 and he was teaching at the Castle School in Thornbury, South Gloucestershire. Their friendship developed over several years and they began a sexual relationship when she was 17, Bristol Crown Court heard. It continued after she left school and resulted in the birth of a child when she was in her early 20s. The teacher’s behaviour came to light only after the former pupil, who cannot be named, ended the relationship and her family realised what was happening. The age and gender of her child were not revealed in court. Parsons is also believed to have a daughter with his wife, who the court heard 'bore' the affair. He returned to the family unit after the girl ended the relationship. He has admitted five counts of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust. Defending, David Scutt said Parsons and his wife, whose name was not given, had grown closer since the affair ended. 'She knew about it while it was going on and bore it,' Mr Scutt said. 'Since it finished the family unit has got closer and closer. 'His career has gone and that will result in a drastic change of lifestyle for her and for their daughter. 'She says that he has lost his self-esteem and feels constantly humiliated.' James Ward, prosecuting, told the court: ‘This relationship began in the way that normal relationships do and resulted in the defendant having full sexual intercourse with the complainant. Sexual intercourse took place within the school.’ He added: ‘She acknowledged she did have a crush on the defendant and thought it was maybe her fault that this happened. Eventually she thought to herself, “Well this is a relationship then”.’ At times, he said, the schoolgirl felt ‘grossed out’ by what was happening. Parsons,  a drama teacher at Castle School, in Thornbury, South Gloucestershire, first met the teenager when she was 13 and began a relationship with her at 17 . The court heard Parsons would take her out for meals and weekend theatre trips, and they stayed in a hotel. But when she was in her early 20s, the relationship ended and she was interviewed by police. She was said to have been encouraged to speak out by her aunt, as Parsons was still teaching children. When he was arrested he admitted the improper relationship and having intercourse with the girl, starting when she was 17. Mr Scutt said: ‘He accepts responsibility for what he has done. He thought it was something that had been wanted and pursued. He thought, wrongly, that it was mutual.’ Mr Scutt said there was no suggestion his client acted inappropriately with other pupils. He added: ‘[Parsons] was, on any view, a passionate and committed teacher. He created, developed and set up the drama department. That is now over.’ The teacher is generally remembered fondly by pupils on the RateMyTeachers.com website. But one former charge wrote in December 2007: ‘Well we all know he focused on one student.’ Parsons has admitted five counts of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust at Bristol Crown Court. He will be sentenced tomorrow . Another comment, from October 2011, described him as ‘one of the few teachers that treated his students as adults’. Approached yesterday at his converted barn home in Dursley, Gloucestershire, Parsons said it was a ‘very upsetting’ time for him and his family, and that his wife did not wish to comment. Last week, a judge provoked an outcry when she said RE teacher Stuart Kerner, 44, had been groomed by a 16-year-old pupil before he took her virginity in a store cupboard. Kerner, who was supported by his wife Katherine, was given an 18-month suspended sentence by Judge Joanna Greenberg QC, who is now being investigated.","Simon Parsons, 52, was a drama teacher at Castle School, Thornbury .

"Mac attack: Crystal Brooks ran over boyfriend Santiago Hernandez with his own truck because he didn't want to go to McDonald's . A Tennessee woman ran over her boyfriend multiple times with his own truck Friday after he refused to stop at McDonald’s. Crystal Brooks, 33, went into a rage after boyfriend Santiago Hernandez, 41, declined to go to the fast food chain. The couple, who live together in Kingsport, have a child and live together, according to a police report posted to The Smoking Gun. After Mr Hernandez went against Ms Brooks’ wishes, she demanded he pull over. He then got out of the Chevrolet S-10 and she replaced him in the driver’s seat. Ms Brooks then hit the gas – with her baby’s father standing in front of the pickup – causing him to go flying onto the hood, then the ground. ‘She then pulled forward and struck him two more times with the truck,’ the report said.

"Faith, community and political leaders gathered at the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta and other events across the country to celebrate the legacy of the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. The 47th annual Martin Luther King Jr. Annual Commemorative Service was taking place this afternoon at the slain civil rights icon's spiritual home. Calling the gathered crowd to remember her father's legacy, the Rev. Bernice King urged people to remember his message of nonviolence. King's sister, Christine King Farris, presided over the service. Gwendolyn Boyd, president of Alabama State University, was to give the keynote address. David Oyelowo, who played King in the movie 'Selma,' also paid tribute. He got choked up as he talked about putting himself in King's place. 'I felt his pain. I felt his burden. I felt the love he had for his family. I felt the love he still has for you Dr. Bernice King,' he said, addressing King's daughter.

LeRoy Moton was a passenger in Mrs Luizzo's car during the Selma marches when she was shot by the KKK . He explained that he, like King, has four children and said he cannot imagine walking through life knowing there are people who wanted to take their lives or that of his wife. Also present and slated to speak at the service were civil rights leader U.S. Rep. John Lewis, U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson and Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed. Bernice King invoked the deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, Eric Garner in New York City and the fatal shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Cleveland, Ohio. 'I cannot help but remember many women and men who have been gunned down, not by a bad police force but by some bad actors in a police force,' she said. She called on those who came to celebrate her father's legacy to act out against injustice but also to remember his message of nonviolence. 'We cannot act unless we understand what Dr. King taught us. He taught us that we still have a choice to make: nonviolent coexistence or violent co-annihilation. I challenge you to work with us as we help this nation choose nonviolence,' Bernice King said. U.S. Rep. John Lewis, who told the crowd he was just 17 when King sent him a bus ticket to come to Montgomery to join the civil rights movement, recalled the man he called his hero and his leader, a man who is 'still a guiding light in my life'. 'The memory of such a great man can never, ever fade,' Lewis said. 'I still think about him almost every day.' Tributes to civil rights leader Dr King Jr were held around the U.S. on Monday as protests over the treatment of minorities by law enforcement rolled on across the country. Observers of Martin Luther King Jr. Day have this year linked the federal holiday to a rallying cry in recent months during demonstrations over police brutality: 'Black lives matter.'

They chalked outlines of bodies on the tree-lined street, played recordings of King's speeches and projected an image of the slain civil rights leader with the words 'Black lives matter,' on the mayor's garage door. Other protests were planned in major cities such as Dallas and New York, where the family of Eric Garner, who died after being placed in a police chokehold, was set to lay a wreath on the Brooklyn street where two uniformed officers were ambushed in December by a gunman claiming to avenge Garner's death. Across the country in northern California, tickets sold out for the final run on Monday of the Freedom Train, the last of the more than two dozen official train services launched 30 years ago by Coretta Scott King in honor of her husband, according to the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr Association of Santa Clara Valley. President Obama honored Martin Luther King Jr.'s legacy on Monday by 'big-brothering' members of the next generation. The President, wife Michelle and daughter Malia traveled to a District of Columbia site for the Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Washington where they helped paint murals and assemble 'literacy kits' made up of flashcards and books intended to help the center's young kids improve their reading and writing skills. The family was joined by Wendy Spencer, CEO of the Corporation for National and Community Service. Sasha Obama was not with her family. In a proclamation issued last week, Obama said the U.S. has made 'undeniable progress' since King agitated for justice and equality for all. But Obama said securing the gains requires 'constant vigilance, not complacency' and he called on all Americans to stand together for good jobs, fair wages, safe neighborhoods and quality education. Much of Obama's Cabinet fanned out across the country Monday to participate in community service projects and events in remembrance of the slain civil rights leader.

He said communities and police departments need to build trust. 'Do we see each other?' Biden asked. 'Do we see each other for who we are?' Biden devoted his 27-minute speech to the tension between police and minorities in some communities around the country following the deaths of two unarmed black men in encounters with white officers in Missouri and New York City this summer. The incidents touched off protests and a national debate over police conduct. Tensions escalated after two New York City police officers were fatally shot last month by a man who suggested in online posts that he was retaliating for the deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York. The gunman, who was black, committed suicide. 'Men often hate each other because they fear each other,' Biden said, quoting King. 'They fear each other because they do not know each other. They do not know each other because they cannot communicate, and they cannot communicate because they are separated.'

Biden did not mention a weekend incident in which several gunshots were fired from a vehicle speeding by the driveway of his Delaware home. Biden and his wife were not home at the time, and there were no reports of injuries. Police continue to investigate the incident, which prompted the Secret Service to boost security at Biden's home. 'It really is good to be home,' said Biden, who left immediately after speaking to a crowd of about 200 people in a half-filled ballroom on Wilmington's riverfront. Biden's speech came just days after a rally in support of police drew about 300 people to downtown Wilmington. Even as the rally was being held, police were involved in a shooting that left a man in critical condition. Authorities said an officer returned fire after the man shot at police following a traffic stop. Police have released few details about Thursday's shooting, including the race of the officers and the occupants of the vehicle. 'Cops have a right to go home at night to see their families,' Biden said. 'All minorities, no matter what the neighborhood, have the right to be treated with respect, and with dignity.'

"Out: UKIP politician Godfrey Bloom quit the party yesterday following his suspension last week . Controversial MEP Godfrey Bloom ‘quit’ UKIP yesterday with an extraordinary parting rant at the party and the journalist who helped bring about his downfall. Mr Bloom was suspended by the UK Independence Party last week after causing uproar at the party’s conference by describing female activists as ‘sluts.’ On the same day he also got embroiled in an altercation with Channel Four News reporter Michael Crick. Yesterday he said he would sit as an independent MEP until next year’s European Parliament elections, although he will ‘privately’ remain a party member. In a characteristically provocative intervention he told the BBC he was now thinking of taking up shooting, adding that ‘Michael Crick might be the first cartridge, if it isn’t my own party chairman’. His departure means that five of the 13 Ukip MEPs elected in 2009 have now parted company with the organisation. Mr Bloom is popular with party members but his headline-grabbing public statements have been the source of growing irritation to Ukip’s leadership as it tries to portray a more professional public image. Last month he provoked accusations of racism by complaining that foreign aid is sent to ‘Bongo Bongo Land’. He has also irritated women with a series of sexist remarks, including saying: ‘I just don’t think they clean behind the fridge enough’ - a notorious comment that indirectly led to his downfall. When female Ukip activists at a fringe meeting last Friday declared they were too busy to ‘clean behind the fridge’ Mr Bloom declared: ‘The room is full of sluts!’ The remark was meant as a joke but provoked a media storm, particularly as Mr Bloom then hit Mr Crick over the head with a Ukip conference programme outside the fringe event in a row about racism. Outburst: UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom said an event to promote women in politics was 'full of sluts' before falling foul of Channel 4 reporter Michael Crick (left) Furious party leader Nigel Farage said . Mr Bloom’s antics had ‘destroyed’ coverage of the party’s annual . conference, and he was suspended from the party just two hours after . giving his keynote address as Ukip’s defence spokesman. In the past Ukip has delighted in being . politically incorrect. But the leadership is trying to adopt a more . serious image in the run-up to next year’s European Parliament elections . which it believes it could win. Upset: UKIP leader Nigel Farage, pictured, has said he is 'sorry' Bloom has left the party . Mr Bloom, an MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber since 2004, yesterday said the ‘New Ukip’ was ‘not really right for me any more’. He said he would continue to support Ukip, but refused to rule out standing as an independent next year, saying: ‘Never say never’. In a statement he said: ‘I have felt for some time now that the New Ukip is not really right for me anymore perhaps than New Labour was right for the Dennis “The beast of Bolsover” Skinner.’ Mr Farage, who shares a flat with Mr Bloom in Brussels, said he did not want to see his old friend kicked out of the party altogether as he had not crossed the lines of extremism or racism. He said: ‘I’m very sorry it has come to this, he’s been with us for 15 years, he’s sat in the European Parliament since 2004, he absolutely 100 per cent believes in everything Ukip stands for and he’s been a good, loyal MEP for us. It’s a sorry state of affairs. ‘All the things Godfrey has said have not been meant in malice but they have all been tremendous distractions from the main messages Ukip is trying to push out... nearly everything he has said has been meant as a joke. ‘I don’t want to see him hounded out of the party... we’re very clear, racism, extremism, we wouldn’t tolerate anything like that.’ Meanwhile, a Ukip councillor yesterday apologised after making repeated references to ‘coloured people’ during a television interview. Red-faced: UKIP suffered further embarrassment when Councillor Viv Lewis, pictured, continually used the offensive term 'coloured' during a television interview . Viv Lewis, a councillor in Cornwall, insisted he was not racist as he had holidayed in the Caribbean. During a TV interview he said: ‘Racist I am not. I like coloured people. I have been to the West Indies. I have sampled their hospitality. I like coloured people.’ Apologising yesterday, he said: ‘When I was growing up, with children from elsewhere, it was quite acceptable. You couldn’t call them black then but apparently you can now. ‘I want to apologise to anyone that was offended. It is not something you will hear me say again.’ ‘I want to apologise to anyone that was offended. It is not something you will hear me say again.’","Godfrey Bloom ‘quit’ UKIP yesterday following his suspension last week .

'Through football and the course of life, I’ve learned to stay poised in certain situations. I’m pretty sure she was scared so the last thing I wanted to do was have her panic. The first thing I told her is ""Don’t panic, I’ll get you out of here"" and I got her out.' Once police arrived and took control of the crash scene, he left and continued on his journey home.

Conservative MP for Wycombe, Steve Baker, takes on an instructor at Combat Academy . The Tory MP for Wycombe told MailOnline that the experience had been worth it – because it had given him an insight into how teenagers who had gone off the rails could turn their lives around. He said: ‘The guy in the video, Reece Coker, came to see me and told me that when people need purpose in their lives, training in self-defence can really give them self-esteem, so, I decided to go along.’ Mr Baker said he had learnt how to fend off attacks – including how not to ‘get punched in the face’. But he said: ‘Self-defence can also help young people channel themselves to give them self-esteem – to use their aggression to do some good. ‘We know that in this country we’ve got all sorts of issues – gang violence for example. ‘I think it’s worth having a look at how something like this can change lives.

"A woman was repeatedly raped, assaulted and tortured over four days before her throat was slit twice by a far-north Queensland man, a court has heard. The man - who cannot be named for legal reasons - appeared in the Innisfail Magistrates Court, south of Cairns, on Tuesday afternoon where he denied the string of charges against him. He faces an attempted murder charge, two counts of rape, as well as multiple deprivation of liberty and assault charges. It is alleged a 66-year-old man held a 32-year-old woman for four days, and repeatedly raped and tortured her . Police allege the woman was attacked at a fruit farm between January 15 and 19 near Tully, south of Cairns. The 32-year-old woman is being treated at Cairns Base Hospital for severe cuts to her throat. She is in a serious but stable condition. A bail application by the man's solicitor, Tom Eckersley, was denied by Magistrate Janelle Brassington after a brief appearance in court by the accused on Tuesday afternoon. The man was also charged with producing dangerous drugs after police allegedly uncovered a cannabis plantation at the property. Details of what the woman said happened were read to the court by Ms Brassington. The 66-year-old man appeared in Innisfail Magistrates Court on Tuesday, and was remanded in custody . 'The complainant told police that over some days she'd been raped and indecently treated by the defendant,' she said, reading from the police report. On Monday morning, the man agreed to take the woman to the Cairns airport but instead drove her to the back of his property, the woman alleges. Her hands were tied with cable ties and the man told her that if she took photos of his property and gave them to police, he would kill her. 'He walked two metres away and kicked her in the back of the knees, and she said she saw him with a silver-coloured instrument and he cut her throat,' Ms Brassington said. 'He then told her he would kill himself and it was her fault.' It is alleged the man again cut her throat because she was not 'bleeding out'. The man then cut the right side of her face after she started to scream.

"In Northern Sweden, the word for 'yes' is undeniably hard to pronounce.

Gee approaches several city dwellers in the video, asking each of them how they say 'yes' and if they could teach him to say it too. Among the best advice given, includes one woman who instructs to 'just [imagine] if you have a mint in your mouth.' When Gee asks why the population of Umea prefers the sound, which is similar to that of sucking on a straw, another woman gives a rather simple explanation. The video features several Umea natives attempting to explain how to make the peculiar sound . The city in Northern Sweden doesn't use 'ja' to vocalise their agreement, but a sucking sound instead . 'Its just an easy way to say it,' she offers. 'You don't have to open your mouth.' In a country known for its strange habits and loveable quirks, Swedes also take pride in words like 'fika' and 'logom.' Fika refers to 'a coffee and cake break,' while logom simply means 'just the right amount.' The video was uploaded just a week ago and already has almost 2 million views . Gee asks a woman if a shoulder shrug must also accompany his use of the new, odd sound . The Swedish Language Council has also recently added 40 new entries to the dictionary for 2015. Among them 'usie,' which refers to a self-portrait (or selfie) photo and 'spoilervarning,' which acts as a warning if someone is about to spoil the plot of a book or film.

"They may look like your average building sites, but these houses were created with nothing more than a 3D printer. The houses, one of which is five storeys high, were created in an industrial park in China's Jiangsu province using new 3D printing technology. The incredible engineering, by Shanghai WinSun Decoration Design Engineering Co., was pioneered ten months ago when the company printed ten buildings - costing just £3,100 - entirely out of concrete using a giant printer. Chinese engineers have created houses with just a 3D printer, including one which is five stories high . The buildings were created in an industrial park in China's Jiangsu province using pioneering 3D printing technology . The printer works by spraying successive layers of recycled construction material to form the structure . The smaller houses cost around £100,000 and hundreds have already been snapped up by buyers including the Egyptian government . Now they have taken the technology further to build the first 3D printed villas and the tallest ever 3D printed building. The homes are created using a printer which is 21ft tall, 32ft wide, and 500ft long, according to 3ders. The 'ink' used is a mixture of recycled construction waste, glass, steel and cement which is sprayed on layer by layer until a thick wall is created. Ma Yi He, CEO of WinSun, explained that the construction industry produces a large amount of carbon emissions, but with 3D printing, waste material can be recycled. This process also means that construction workers are at less risk of coming into contact with hazardous materials. The new technology could also lead to the building sites of the future could be far less noisy, more clean and easier on the eye.

"Austin Mitchell says the House of Commons, once the playground for Britain’s elite to exercise the great game of power, is now more like a cheap gym . The House of Commons, once the playground for Britain’s elite to exercise the great game of power, is today more like a cut-price gym. People join hopeful and exhilarated — then find it too difficult and eventually slink off disillusioned. In the 18th century, Edmund Burke described the Commons as an institution that included the best and most opulent people in Britain. In 1936, the inter-war MP Col. Josiah Wedgwood claimed its life ‘combines the mental gymnastics of college with the fresh wind of the outer world. Fellow members are the staunchest friends man ever had. There is no other Parliament like the English.’ Sadly, all that’s gone. It’s still a club, but a third-rate one. Its members are our political elite, but they no longer speak the language of Gladstone. They’re an elite that’s been replaced by arrivistes and middle management types. The great game of power has become a shouting match between public servants, teachers and social workers on the one side (Labour) and small businessmen and funny money men from the City on the other (Tory), all orchestrated and scripted by apparatchiks from lesser league student politics. Dismal . David Brent from The Office would be more at home in the Commons than Winston Churchill or Enoch Powell. I’m standing down at the election after 38 years. Because of age mainly — I was 80 in September. I was elected in the year Virginia Wade won Wimbledon, Red Rum won the Grand National and James Callaghan was Prime Minister. Comparing those days with now, I can only say the level of debate has sunk dismally — and it was already on the downward slope when I arrived. David Brent from The Office, played by Ricky Gervais middle, would be more at home in the Commons than Winston Churchill or Enoch Powell . We no longer discuss the issues of Empire, of course, because we don’t have one. But the lightning flash of spontaneous free debate that was once taken for granted in the Commons is no longer. Gladstone used to give three-hour speeches, but today we have time-limited debates in which speakers gabble for five minutes before it’s the next person’s turn. Political minds no longer wrestle with the great issues of the day, or with each other. Instead, MPs read student essays, often written for them in lamentable grammar, in the hope of getting into their constituencies’s local papers — never the nationals. We should introduce the UK equivalent of the American Congressional Record in which representatives write down their speeches, so they don’t have to say them out loud and bore others waiting to recite their own productions. The most striking decline in standards has been in Prime Minister’s Questions, which has become a half-hour of custard-pie throwing . The most striking decline in standards has been in Prime Minister’s Questions, which has become a half-hour of custard-pie throwing. Questions are handed out for MPs to ask: ‘Have you stopped beating the poor?’ from the Left, versus: ‘Isn’t it marvellous news from my constituency where 20 shelf-stacking jobs have been created by Aldi?’ on the Right. Then the questions receive rehearsed answers, alternating between the Prime Minister replying: ‘Miliband’s a twerp.’ And: ‘Our long-term economic plan is working miracles.’ The first-class brains and the serious thinkers — people such as Labour’s Sixties Education Secretary Tony Crosland, above, the Seventies and Eighties Tory intellectual Ian Gilmour or the outspoken and cerebral Enoch Powell — who once stimulated and excited the Commons, now go into the City, the law, accountancy houses or our huge tax-avoidance industry . Questions to ministers about their departments function at a similar level, as spoon-fed debating points are raised by sycophantic MPs. As for the debates on legislation or proper issues, which used to be where ministers had to defend their arguments, it’s now rare to hear a speech that makes one think because it’s all agreement and soundbites. Most speeches toe the party line, usually peppered with cliches such as ‘hard-working families’ or ‘cost of living crisis’. The first-class brains and the serious thinkers — people such as Labour’s Sixties Education Secretary Tony Crosland, the Seventies and Eighties Tory intellectual Ian Gilmour or the outspoken and cerebral Enoch Powell — who once stimulated and excited the Commons, now go into the City, the law, accountancy houses or our huge tax-avoidance industry. As an academic snob, my feeling is that is we have fewer firsts today but more bottom seconds from lesser universities. So we lose out in every way. Public relations has replaced policy and we’ve ended up with fewer serious thinkers but more political obsessives, all of them with less experience of the real world of work. We’ve also lost the role of providing the national forum of debate to the media, who’ve stolen our job of holding the executive account. Leech . The old relationship — whereby parliamentary debates created the news and the media reported it — has been reversed. We now take the issues from the media and chase the hares they set running rather than vice versa. It’s true that, as MPs, we each have a platform from which to ask questions in the Commons, but this is far less important than it used to be because we MPs have lost respect. Ministerial departments no longer jump to our demands. Privatised utilities and the quasi-departmental firms that leech off government spending — like security firm G4S and the business out-sourcing companies Capita and Serco — fob us off with PR answers. So we’re dependant on getting the interest and support of the media to make the government listen. Then there is the changed working environment. The Commons has always been a club. Now it’s a dull one, where socialising, friendships, mixing and bonding have fallen victim to family-friendly hours. These have turned the grind of late nights and long debates into a two-and-a-half-day week. Members arrive late on Monday, get as many meetings in as they can, go home Thursday and spend spare evenings watching telly rather than plotting or chatting in the Commons bars. The lush facilities of Portcullis House, where MPs have their offices, are crowded out during the day with ten o’clock to six o’clock staffers in sharp suits — who know everything from electoral calculus to social security rules better than we do — but are deserted at night. We’ve lost the awkward squad of MPs who tripped up the executive by throwing spanners into its works — people such as Labour’s Tam Dalyell or Tory Eric Forth. It’s true that, as MPs, we each have a platform from which to ask questions in the Commons, but this is far less important than it used to be because we MPs have lost respect - ministerial departments no longer jump to our demands . Can’t have the legislative factory disrupted, you see. None of this, I should add to avoid a deluge of feminist twitterati, is due to the increase in the number of women. They’ve civilised the place, eliminated the boys’ club sillinesses and brought more realism to debates. It’s due to the tighter grip of the parties on their MPs and the increase in the number of apparatchiks. From being a training ground for senators, the Commons has become a numbers game dominated by two chanting choruses — one praising, the other criticising the executive steam-roller as it drives over us. We can still abuse the executive and throw our pre-cooked custard pies, but when the executive makes its biggest mistakes — Iraq, Helmand, Trident, HS2 and 3 — or erodes our liberties for whatever purpose, we can be relied on to rally round. Paradoxically, the amount of work and number of staff have increased as our influence has declined. We now have more MPs’ committees than ever before — including, joy of my life, the Public Accounts Committee on which I sit. Trivial . These give MPs a new role and new satisfaction as amateur Perry Masons, but activity isn’t influence. It keeps us busy, but much of what’s raised is trivial. Select committees have done some good reports, particularly Margaret Hodge’s Public Accounts Committee, but it’s mostly closing doors after horses have bolted and government is much better at apologising and promising than it is at listening and changing. Perhaps I complain too much. My long career has been a fighting retreat from Social Democracy, Keynesian economic management, the mixed economy and equality before the triumph of neo-liberalism, the EU and free-market economics. I’ve enjoyed it and I’d still like to carry on if I wasn’t so old and decrepit in what’s becoming a youth club. Yet the fact is MPs today are no longer tribunes of the people, they’re the sewer workers and street cleaners of Britain’s creaking constitution.","Austin Mitchell is standing down at the election after 38 years .

"This cheeky sea lion was clearly bored of the sea and decided to wander into an open-air swimming pool instead. The brazen animal passed through the reception area and a cafe before plunging into the saltwater swimming pool in Dunedin, New Zealand. 'She was sitting outside the pool entrance from about 7am this morning,' said a surprised member of the St Clair Salt Water Pool staff. The sea lion queued up for the pool to open, and then sauntered it's way to take an afternoon dip . 'And then about 2.30pm decided to go for a stroll through the cafe, and then ended up in the pool. 'So she's having a nice free swim in the pool at the moment.' Swimmers remained in the pool as the sea lion sunned herself by the toddlers' area originally, before making a quick exit when she dived in to do some laps. It will have certainly given any holidaymakers something to tell the family on their return home. The sea lion was eventually coaxed out, but wanted to return after realising the game was nearly up . The pesky sea lion does not fear humans, and probably wanted to splash around with the crowds . New Zealand sea lions are known not to fear humans, so the tactics used were to clear the complex so as to make the animal lonely. Devoid of company, the sea lion clambered out soon after, retracing its journey back out of the complex. The sea lion taking a dip provided an unusual turn to the day for staff at he St Clair Salt Water Pool . Members of the public were soon told to leave the swimming pool when the sea lion jumped in . But realising it was all a devious plan, the animal tried to re-enter for another dip in the pool. Speaking to the Otago Daily Times, Department of Conservation conservation services manager David Agnew said: 'It was quite hard case. We had to lock the doors. It was trying to get back in. It made a big mess with oil from its flippers on the windows.'","Animal wandered through the reception as a pool in Dunedin, New Zealand .

"Growing up inside The Children of God cult, Natacha Tormey was sexually abused, made to live in a compound and taught to fear the outside world. At the age of 18 she escaped and now, eleven years later, she feels strong enough to tell her story. 'I was sexually abused from the age of four - on several occasions,' the cult survivor revealed as she poured her heart out to Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford on ITV's This Morning. 'It was a very sexualised environment. It started out innocently with the idea that anything done in love is OK, but it became more bizarre where husband and wives were expected to share their partners with others. 'Then it went one step further with flirty fishing - where women were told to use their bodies to win men (converts) to God, often in return for a donation.' Scroll down for video . Natacha Tormey with Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford on ITV's This Morning . 'I often saw adults doing things in the same room as me,' she revealed. 'I have very few happy childhood memories. The brief moments spent with my family, were few and far between,' said Natacha, who was forced to live in a compound with 150 other members in a variety of communes across South East Asia, East Africa and Europe. 'I have 12 siblings but we certainly weren't at the beach every day - we were behind high walls in a compound,' she recalled. To make money, the cult would send the children out to beg. 'We'd go out fundraising and do shows. But we were taught to fear outside world,' said Natacha, whose parents are French-born. 'We were told there were two types of people - the nasty people were goats and nice people were sheep. 'But they told us that the majority had turned away from God and that we were the army of the end time.' Natacha was sexually abused from the age of four and made to witness sexual acts by other adults . The cult's leader, David Berg, predicted . that the world would come to an end at the end of the millennium, but . died in 1994 before witnessing his prediction fail. 'They trained us to be elite soldiers who would be fighting the anti-christ. They told us we'd be blessed with lightning bolts from our eyes and have the ability to knock people dead with the touch of our hand. These were all the gifts we were meant to receive,' she said. It's been 11 years since Natacha managed to escape from the cult and she's now happily married and been living in the UK for five years. 'I'm in contact with my parents and siblings,' she said. 'My parents left a couple of years ago.' How does she have a normal relationship with them, given so much of her suffering was due to their decisions, she was asked. 'It's difficult - I went through many years of bitterness and hatred,' she admitted. 'But it's the understanding that they were victims in some sort of way too. 'That doesn't excuse everything but my main opinion now is that to hate and to be bitter would only make me unhappy and I'm not going to let the cult do that to me anymore so at some point for your own sanity you have to let go.' The cult, which has now changed its name to The Family International, has denied any allegations of institutionalised abuse. In her new book the cult survivor tells of her disturbing childhood and her escape . In a statement, read by This Morning's Eamonn Holmes, the cult said it had apolologised on a number of occasions to anyone who felt they were a victim of abuse. The statement also expressed a 'zero tolerance' for abuse and said the cult permanently expelled any members who violated the policy. Natacha did not comment, but responded to the statement with a wry smile. The cult survivor has now documented the full story of her childhood in a book 'Born into the Children of God: My life in a religious sex cult and my struggle for survival on the outside'. 'It's been amazing and cathartic,' said Natacha. 'It's the final step in my healing process, to not feel I have to hide or feel shame about my past and trying to turn it into something good and encouraging for other people.'","Natacha Tormey told of her ordeal on ITV's This Morning .

"Just a single cup of coffee a day could help ward off skin cancer, said a study. Four cups daily, however, would be the most protective against malignant melanoma, said researchers. This is the most deadly form of the cancer, which usually starts in a mole and is triggered by short, sharp bursts of sunlight, such as on holiday. Scroll down for video . Study: Starting the day with a cup of coffee won’t just wake you up; it could also cut your odds of skin cancer . Scientists from the US government’s health research department tracked 450,000 men and women for a decade. The volunteers had an average age of 63 at the start of the study when all were free of malignant melanoma. By the end, almost 3,000 had been diagnosed with the skin cancer. Those who drank coffee – 90 per cent of the group – were less likely to have the disease. The more they drank, the lower their odds, reported the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. Those who downed four cups a day were 20 per cent less likely to suffer the illness than those who never drank any. Previous analysis has shown caffeine can trigger the death of UV-damaged cells but leave healthy ones unharmed. The analysis took into account factors that might have affected the result, including smoking, alcohol intake and how sunny a person’s hometown was. Increasing problem: The rise of the package holiday is blamed for malignant melanoma now being five times more common than in the 1970s. Coral Bay, near Paphos in Cyprus is pictured . The researchers said that their finding is preliminary and more research into coffee and, in particular caffeine, ‘are warranted’. They said that impact of malignant melanoma is so great that even a small reduction in risk could be meaningful. However, coffee addicts aren’t completely in the clear. The NHS advises that drinking more than four cups of coffee a day may increase blood pressure and that lovers of coffee, tea and other caffeine-rich drinks should consider cutting down. The rise of the package holiday is blamed for malignant melanoma now being five times more common than in the 1970s, with more 13,000 cases and over 2,000 deaths a year in the UK . OIder men are particularly at risk - perhaps because they are spending time outside gardening or doing DIY shirtless. Sarah Williams, of Cancer Research UK, said: ‘Drinking coffee isn’t a proven way to reduce the risk of developing melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer, and this study doesn’t change that. ‘There are lots of drawbacks to this research – it didn’t ask people about how often they went out in strong sun, whether they protected themselves or how likely they were to get sunburn. ‘In January the UK sun isn’t strong enough to cause sunburn. But if you’re heading off for some winter sun or going skiing, make sure you protect your skin from strong sun with shade, clothes and sunscreen.’","Malignant melanoma is the most deadly form of skin cancer .

"Boko Haram attacks have forced more than 10,000 panic-stricken Cameroonians to flee from the border regions with Nigeria's Borno State. In recent weeks, the Islamic militant group has massacred over 2,000 people in two north-eastern towns - before kidnapping dozens of people during an attack on Mabass village. Abubakar Shekau, the man who claims to be its leader, has previously threatened to target Cameroon unless it scrapped its constitution and embraced Islam. The insurgents have looted food and livestock on the border, which has raised fears that a food shortage and humanitarian crisis is imminent, according to a government spokesperson. Threat: In a video released on January 5, Boko Haram's supposed leader Abubakar Shekau (pictured) promised to strike Cameroon with the same ferocity with which it has terrorised Nigeria . Destruction: Boko Haram killed over 2,000 people in a brutal attack on the northern towns of Baga and Doron Baga (pictured) on January 3 . Retaliation: On Friday, dozens of Chadian tanks headed out of the capital towards Cameroon to help fight Nigeria's Boko Haram insurgents . Turmoil: A map showing Nigeria and the location of Baga which was devastated by brutal Boko Haram fanatics last week . The 10 schools deserted after Sunday's attack on Mabass follow around 140 that have already shut their doors since the assaults began bleeding over the border, the country's Minister of Education has said. The government is trying to accommodate affected students but Bernadette Appi, a primary school teacher in Maroua, says safer schools have a 'moral obligation' to admit fleeing students. These latest attacks highlight the growing regional threat posed by Boko Haram, which has sought to impose strict Shariah law in Nigeria - the continent's most populous nation. It has now seized villages along a 155-mile stretch of land along the Cameroon-Nigeria border. Boko Haram Islamist fighters from Nigeria kidnapped around 80 people on Sunday - many of them children. They killed three others in their most audacious  cross-border attack on villages in northern Cameroon, army and government officials said. They believe around 30 people managed to escape. Troops from Chad began to arrive in the country on the same day, to support their fight against the militants. Neighbouring countries are being increasingly drawn into Nigeria's five-year battle with the extremists, which has killed thousands and driven 1.6million people from their homes - and into neighboring Cameroon, Niger and Chad. Officals believe Boko Haram has been recruiting fighters in all three countries. This latest atrocity comes as the International Criminal Court's prosecutor condemned the 'appalling levels of violence' in Nigeria and warned she would prosecute members of the party responsible for crimes against humanity. Fatou Bensouda said her office is continuing a preliminary examination into the allegations that Boko Haram extremists are killing large numbers of civilians - as well as manipulating boys and girls into fighting for their cause.

She also warned Nigeria's government of its obligation to prosecute crimes that 'deeply shock the conscience of humanity'. She added: 'No one should doubt my resolve, if need be, to prosecute those individuals most responsible for war crimes or crimes against humanity.' Both Boko Haram and the Nigerian military have been accused of the summary executions of hundreds of civilians in the 5-year uprising, in which over 10,000 people died only last year. Boko Haram has increased the ferocity and deadliness and  of its attacks in recent weeks. On January 3, the group killed more than 2,000 civilians and razed 3,700 buildings to the ground in the towns of Baga and Doron Baga. Survivors of the attack recall having to flee over the dead bodies of people who were 'killed like insects'. The group, which has killed thousands and kidnapped hundreds in its bid to carve out an Islamic state in northern Nigeria, has also targeted Cameroon and Niger over the past year as it seeks to expand its zone of operations.","Militants have killed over 2,000 and kidnapped 80 people in recent weeks .

"Jailed for 12 months: Drama teacher Simon Parsons (pictured) had a long-term affair with a pupil . A drama teacher who had a five-year affair with a 17-year-old pupil – and fathered her child – was jailed for just 12 months yesterday. Simon Parsons, 52, whose wife is standing by him, had sex with the girl at the school and his home. Handing down the sentence, the judge described his actions as a ‘breach of trust’. His wife, who did not attend court, had previously begged the judge to show leniency, insisting her husband was ‘not a monster’, but a ‘gentle man who made a massive mistake’. But Parsons was handed the maximum possible sentence under current sentencing guidelines. In this case, the judge said, because she was over 16, he could impose a sentence of no more than 18 months. This was reduced by a third on account of Parsons’ guilty plea. After he was jailed, the victim’s mother said: ‘Every parent sends their child to school where they expect them to be safe. ‘To find out that school is the very place your child was abused is a very horrifying ordeal for your daughter, and indeed all of your family to have gone through.’ The court heard the victim, who cannot be named and is now taking civil action against her former school, described feeling ‘confused and lost’ and had been ‘let down by a teacher whom she looked up to and trusted’. She said in a statement: ‘I felt grossed out at one point and then I thought, “Oh well, he fancies me”.’ Parsons was jailed yesterday after he admitted sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust . Parsons,  a drama teacher at Castle School (pictured) in Thornbury, South Gloucestershire, first met the teenager when she was 13 and began a relationship with her at 17 . Yesterday the judge echoed the girl’s mother’s words, telling Parsons, from Dursley, Gloucestershire, his actions were a ‘breach of trust’. Judge Neil Ford QC told the teacher: ‘You didn’t see the girl as a victim of unlawful or inappropriate behaviour, but you now know that your behaviour has had a real impact upon her. Parents are withdrawing their children from a primary school run by the wife of the teacher ‘groomed’ by his 16-year-old student. Married couple: Katherine and Stuart Kerner . Stuart Kerner, 44, was convicted of having sex with a pupil at another school, where he was deputy head, but was let off with an 18-month suspended sentence amid huge controversy after the female judge claimed he was effectively groomed by the pupil. His wife, Katherine, 42, acting head of Wyborne primary in Greenwich, South East London, yesterday returned to her job after being placed on ‘enforced leave’ – much to the disgust of parents who claim she ‘condoned’ her husband’s actions by standing by him. The law says there are grounds to disqualify any person from working with under eights if they are living with someone who is banned. Parents also criticised the school for failing to tell them that she was coming back. Sarah-Lea Cross, 31, who has two children at the school, is in the process of applying to have them moved. She said: ‘If she’s living with him and supporting him she shouldn’t be here.’ ‘I am sure that she is right when she describes the consequences of your actions as resulting in her feeling confused and lost.’ The court heard that as a treat for the girl’s 17th birthday, the teacher had taken her to the theatre in London and then to a hotel where he had sex with her. The relationship continued after she left school, and she went on to have a baby in her early 20s. It only came to light after the girl ended things and it became clear to her family what had happened. A relative was said to have ‘encouraged’ her to tell police about what happened because Parsons was still teaching. Referring to Parsons’ wife’s plea at a previous hearing, the judge him: ‘Your wife is standing by you and has forgiven you. She is acting in the most difficult of circumstances. ‘You have brought that position on her. I am acutely aware of the misery that these proceeding have brought upon your immediate family.’ Formerly head of drama at The Castle School in Thornbury, Gloucestershire, Parsons showed no reaction as he was sentenced to 12 months in prison. He was barred from working with children for life after pleading guilty to five counts of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust. Last night Peter Saunders, of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said: ‘We would generally expect that a custodial sentence is absolutely appropriate if society is to make the statement that this is totally unacceptable. ‘I used to be a teacher, and you do not cross that line under any circumstances. To do that is a betrayal.’","Simon Parsons, 52, was a drama teacher in Thornbury, Gloucestershire .

According to the NSW Department of Primary Industries, a total of 51 ocean beaches from Wollongong to Newcastle are currently netted between 1 September and 30 April each year. The nets are ‘sunk nets’ set below the surface in about 10 to 12 metres of water, within 500 metres of the shore and are fitted with acoustic warning devices to alert dolphins and whales. The Department’s website warns: ‘While shark attacks are exceptionally rare events, there is a risk inherent in swimming in any waterway. The only way that you can 100 per cent guarantee you will not have a shark encounter is not to go into the water.’ A Eagle Ray appeared to be dead when the Channel Seven team first spotted it tangled in the net . But they freed it and it the ray managed to swim off . Various types of marine life were found dead and decaying in the nets which looked tangled and broken . This photo shows a shark net and rope entangled in the water in NSW . Although shark nets are in place at many beaches in NSW and Queensland, the most common type of net is not actually designed to act as a shark barrier. 'The program protects around two million people who swim at these beaches each year,' a Department spokesperson said. 'The nets do not stretch from one end of a beach to the other. They are not designed to create a total barrier between bathers and sharks. They are designed to deter sharks from establishing territories, thereby reducing the odds of a shark encounter,' they added. However, great white sharks are a protected species and must by law be released if found alive in shark nets or on drumlines. In November, two great white sharks were found dead in nets just 400m off the coast of Bondi on separate occasions. In November two great white sharks were found dead in shark nets at Bondi Beach . Great white sharks are a protected species and must by law be released if found alive in shark nets or on drumlines . A shark was found dead in nets just 400m off the coast of Bondi . The spearfisherman who spotted the shark said: 'It's not so great when they're dead and laying on the bottom in a net' Ian Puckeridge, who works as a spear fisherman, spotted one shark lying dead in the net, Channel Seven reports. 'It's quite awesome to see them in the water when they're alive, not so great when they're dead and laying on the bottom in a net,’ Puckeridge told Seven. The other shark was picked up by a contractor boat on behalf of the Fisheries department and taken from Bondi to the Fisheries wharf in Sydney harbour where it was unloaded into a container to be taken for testing and an autopsy. Photos taken by a witness on a nearby boat show the shark, hung from its mouth, being winched in the air by men in hard hats and high-vis jackets at the wharf. Witness Nick Wenham told Daily Mail Australia: 'It was definitely from Bondi Beach. It's a 2.5-3m great white that needed to be taken to the Fisheries for testing because it's a protected species.' 'It was dead with its tail removed. We followed the boat from Bradley's head in the harbour up to the fisheries where I took the pictures. Another great white killed in the Bondi shark nets is pictured here after being picked up by the Department of Fisheries . 'The shark went into the container behind and they shut the doors as soon as it was in,' Mr Wenham added. 'The tail was on the back deck,' he pointed out. The Humane Society of Australia is one organisation that is campaigning against shark nets, which they label ‘indiscriminate killers’. ‘In late 2013 in NSW a humpback whale calf and a dolphin were both caught and drowned in the shark nets. In 2010 reports indicated more than 4000 animals had been killed in NSW. ‘In November 2009 in NSW alone two threatened species, a great white shark and a dugong were trapped and killed in the nets. In Queensland 16 dolphins, 6 whales, 1 dugong and 30 turtles were caught in shark nets in 2009,’ the Society claims. Michael Kennedy, director of the Humane Society International Australia, told Daily Mail Australia shark nets 'are old fashioned and cruel and should be to be taken out'. 'In theory if it is alive they are supposed to release them but if it died it should be used for research so it didn't die in vain,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Photos taken by a witness on a nearby boat show the shark, hung from its mouth, being winched in the air by men in hard hats and high-vis jackets at the wharf . Michael Kennedy, director of the Humane Society International Australia, told Daily Mail Australia shark nets 'are old fashioned and cruel and should be to be taken out' 'Groups like ours are totally opposed to shark nets … research recognises that they are a key threat to a whole range of species… but they are scared of what would happen if they are remove the nets,' Mr Kennedy said. 'Even people whose sons and parents have been killed in the surf don't want revenge killings … I think that is the attitude today in Australia.' In some parts of Australia, such as selected Sydney Harbour beaches, a different type of barrier made from smaller mesh and/or vertical steel bars is in place. This type of net is thought to act as a more effective and less harmful barrier. Aerial patrols are also in place at many popular beaches to search for sharks that are near the shoreline, with a siren issuing warnings to swimmers to exit the water. Sharnie Connell, the founder of campaign group No NSW Shark Cull, told Daily Mail Australia that there are ‘lots of alternatives to shark nets already on trial all around the world.’ In South Africa, electromagnetic rods are being tested as a way to deter sharks. They are also trialling a different type of net that doesn’t entangle marine life. The Bondi Beach shark nets are situated around 400 metres from the shore . ‘The nets are deployed each day and removed and monitored each day,’ Connell said. ‘In South Africa they have a shark spotter’s programme, they have volunteers… and have a series of flags they put up if one is sighted,’ she explained. Another system that has already been trialled at Sydney Aquarium uses sonar to detect sharks in the area and sends message to lifeguards to tell people to get out of the water. ‘I just want to see them not killing marine life... we'd like to see them trial a few different kinds of methods. ‘Some methods will be suitable for different beaches ... make them safe for people and marine animals,’ she added. ‘The fact is that the ocean is a shark’s territory. Sharks are a natural and important part of the ocean environment, and when we enter open waters we are entering their domain – not a swimming pool. ‘No program or combinations of programs can ever totally eliminate the risk of a shark attack,’ the NSW Department of Primary Industries website informs. Concerned swimmers are advised to stay between the flags when swimming at the beach, where the area is patrolled by lifesavers and lifeguards.","A Channel 7 report found holes and tears in nets at popular NSW beaches .

Ms Calver told Daily Mail Australia the crash happened so fast she had no time to process what had happened. ‘It was over in a split second. As soon as I saw the kangaroo he was under the wheel and I was hurtling over the side.’ The kangaroo, disoriented by the fall, jumped across the gap and fell into an overpass, where it was hit by a car and died. Ms Calver suffered deep scratches from the fall and received stitches from intensive care paramedics at the scene, but she avoided serious injury. ‘My elbow and knee took the brunt of the fall. It was a long cut, about 11cm long and very deep. I had 8 stitches but luckily no broken bones,’ she said.

"She battled not to let the death of AFL husband Troy Broadbridge mar her future after watching the Boxing Day tsunami claim his life as they honeymooned in Thailand in 2004. And after years of being plagued by nightmares and incredible pain - at one stage even contemplating suicide in her darkest moment - Trisha Silvers has now found love with barman Jake Squires. The happy pair, said to be engaged after meeting through a dating charity last year, have shared their  love for each other on Facebook, uploading jolly snaps of them beaming broadly. Scroll down for video . Finding love again: Trisha Broadbridge, 33, is said to be engaged to barman Jake Squires (pictured), ten years after losing AFL player husband Troy . Untimely death: Troy Broadbridge played for the Melbourne Demons in the AFL before his death in 2004 . Phi Phi Island: Troy was among almost 230,000 people, including 26 Australians, who died on Boxing Day 2004 when a devastating tsunami rolled across the Pacific, destroying parts of Thailand, Sri Lanka and Indonesia . Friends say the couple are now engaged and Trisha, 33, who has reverted to her maiden name, is poised to announce the couple's love in an exclusive magazine interview. Rewind ten years ago and it was an entirely different affair for the then 23-year-old who was celebrating her honeymoon with Melbourne AFL player Troy Broadbridge. She watched in horror as her 26-year-old footballer husband was swept out to sea as they  strolled along the beach, hand-in-hand, on Thailand's Phi Phi Island as the tsunami struck. Fond memories: Trisha, seen on her wedding day, says she'll never forget Troy, who taught her how to love . The way it was: The couple wed on 18 December 2004 and were only married for eight days when the tidal wave ripped them apart . Later she revealed a powerful surge of water uprooted a bungalow in front of them which then hit her and she was swept away in the torrent. His body was later discovered and identified by his father, Wayne. The Melbourne Demons player Broadbridge was among almost 230,000 people, including 26 Australians, who died on Boxing Day 2004 when the tidal wave rolled across the Pacific, destroying parts of Thailand, Sri Lanka and Indonesia. Smiling again: Youth worker Trisha met Jake thanks to a dating campaign called Five in Five which challenges singletons to dare each other to line up five dates in as many weeks . The pair have remained tight-lipped about their romance with Jake telling Daily Mail Australia simply: 'I don't really want to talk about it.' A close friend of the two, based in Melbourne, told Daily Mail Australia: 'Trisha is absolutely lovely, she lost her husband in the Boxing Day Tsunami ten years ago and is now engaged to a lovely guy. 'She is finally able to move on with her life. It's taken some time but she's got a second stab at love,' the friend added. Trisha, a chief executive officer at St Kilda Youth Service, and Jake, who works at the bar at The Parlor eaterie in Cheltenham, Victoria, caught each other's eye during a dating campaign Five In Five which challenges singletons to date five times in as many weeks. Lost love: Troy Broadbridge, of the Melbourne Demons team, poses for his headshot during the  2004 AFL season, the year the tsunami claimed his life on Thailand's Phi Phi island . She has told friends she is excited about the future with Jake and indeed friends on their respective Facebook accounts remark how contented they both look. Recalling the horror of their trip to Thailand, Trisha said Troy shouted at her to keep her head above water as he was dragged away by tides. 'This was the last time I saw Troy,' she told The Age a year later. 'Often, I'll have a dream about someone I've spent time with during the day, where there's water and I can't save them,' she previously told The Age. 'It's always different places, and the water comes.' In her book Beyond the Wave, published in 2005, she talks about the unbearable pain of missing her husband which saw her contemplate suicide. 'Troy was not there to hold me, and he never would be ever again … I sat on the bed with a whole bunch of pills in front of me and the phone in my hand,' she writes. 'I rang my mum, hysterical, and told her to get over here because I was going to hurt myself.' Looking to the future: The brunette  has told friends she is excited about the future with Jake . The nightmares have subsided and Trisha battled to remain positive in the face of despair. She has worked tirelessly to raise money for victims of the Tsunami and in 2006 received a Young Australian of the Year Award for her work in Thailand and with Australian youth. She returns regularly to visit the Broadbridge Education Centre on Phi Phi Island, a school erected in his honour by the Melbourne Football Club and paid for by the AFL Players' Association. 'I never want to forget what happened and I never want to forget Troy,' she told the Herald Sun five years after the disaster. 'He was my first love and someone I admired so much,' she added. Daily Mail Australia has contacted organisers of the Five in Five challenge but they refused to comment. The campaign raises money for charities Whitelion, which fights against poverty, and St Kilda Gatehouse, set up to stamp out sexual exploitation among women.","Trisha Silvers engaged to barman Jake Squires .

"Police are appealing to the public to help solve a 15-year-old cold case, offering a $250,000 reward for anyone who can help investigations into the disappearance of a 21-year-old man. Marc Christian Mietus went missing on Australia Day in 2000 in Queensland after picking up a hitchhiker. On January 4 2000, the young man was in the process of moving from his family home in Melbourne to Brisbane, hoping for a new start and to 'get his life back on track' according to his father, Kris Mietus. The victim's father is pleading with the public to come forward with information so his family can finally have closure from the traumatic experience of losing their beloved son. 'I've got to be honest, I've probably resigned myself to the fact that he has met foul play,' Mr Mietus said at a press conference on Tuesday. Marc Mitetus (right) with his sister Prue before he disappeared without a trace in January 2000 . 'The family, including myself and his two sisters, have (come to this conclusion).' For 15 years Marc Mietus' loved ones have struggled after the 21-year-old 'vanished without a trace'. 'We're after closure and once we get that we can move on. It's very difficult not to,' Mr Mietus explained. Mr Mietus was travelling alone from Melbourne to Queensland when he encountered a hitchhiker. 'During his car journey, Mr Mietus picked up a hitchhiker,' Detective Superintendent Steve Holohan of the Homicide Group said. To repay the favour, the hitchhiker offered Mr Mietus accomodation at his property in the Wide Bay region, 70 kilometres inland from Bundaberg. 'Marc befriended the man who allowed him to stay in a caravan on his property on Dillarnil Booyal Road, Booyal via Childers.' Mr Mietus made his home at the Booyal property, whilst also spending time at another friend's residence in Kelvin Grove, an inner northern suburb of Brisbane. At about 6.30am on January 26 2000 Marc is believed to have arrived back at the Booyal property on his red 250cc Honda road trail bike. Mr Mietus was travelling alone from Melbourne to Queensland when he encountered a hitchhiker, who offered him accommodation in exchange of a lift . After spending time at the property and making several phone calls he was seen leaving the home in a car with of a group of people, believed to be heading to Brisbane. He has not been seen since and police believe Marc may have met with foul play. Despite extensive searches and investigating all leads on the case, police are still yet to determine what happened to the plumbing apprentice after he left the house. 'Certainly, we believe there are people out there that know what happened to him and others who have crucial information regarding this case,' said Detective Holohan. 'We are offering $250,000 for anybody who gives information that leads to the identification of the person responsible for the homicide . 'We strongly suspect he was met with foul play somewhere between Childers and Brisbane.' The missing man's distressed father spoke at a police conference, speaking openly about his son in the hope it would help finally find answers. Mr Mietus was last seen leaving Booyal, near Childers, travelling in a car full of people on the way to Brisbane . 'There were probably two key things in his life which set him in a direction which the family wasn’t really impressed with,' his father revealed. 'His mother walked out when he was 15 years of age,' Kris Mietus explained. This abandonment is believed to have had a profound effect on the teen who became involved with 'the wrong crowd'. 'Up until 15 he was a very gifted child and had a great association with everybody in the family,' said Mietus. The talented athlete was also rejected in his attempts to become a professional AFL player. 'It set him off on the wrong path and he probably associated with the wrong people. He probably shouldn’t have been smoking marijuana,' his father told the press conferenece. But as the 21-year-old set off for Queensland just weeks before his disappearance he was determined to turn over a new leaf. Instead, it is believed he lost his life and 15 years later his family are still fighting to uncover how. 'Someone’s obviously done away with him and we want that person brought to justice,' said Kris. Mr Mietus' desperate father has spoken frankly about his son, revealing that the young man fell into the wrong crowd after his mother left and he was rejected from an AFL opportunity .","Marc Mietus went missing 15 years ago when he was just 21 years old .

"Embarrassing: Christina Marie Searcy is booked into Precinct 4 after her meth pipe was removed . One woman's panicked attempt to hide a meth pipe in her vagina during a drugs bust last week ended in an embarrassing trip to a Texas emergency room. On Friday, around 6pm, Christina Marie Searcy, 36, was pulled over along with three other friends after a Montgomery County deputy responded to a report of fraud committed by them. The deputy reported he smelled marijuana from their van and when driver Kevin Gene Hales, 20, exited the vehicle, a joint fell out with him. When the van was searched, a coin purse containing several bags of cocaine was also found and Hales, Searcy, Kimberly Kinn and Melinda Robertson were taken into custody. They were warned when they were booked into jail that if they didn't declare all drugs on their bodies they would face additional charges. At this point Kinn revealed she had a pipe in her bra, which was tested for methamphetamine, and proved positive. Searcy then admitted to having a pipe reports the Montgometry County Police Reporter. However, she also confessed the pipe was not in her bra but in her vagina. Officers let her try and remove it, but she discovered to her dismay it was stuck. An ambulance was called and Searcy was taken to Kingwood Emergency Room and the pipe was successfully removed. It was then tested and proved positive for methamphetamine.

"Sir Winston was described by Mr Paxman as a ‘a ruthless egotist, a chancer, and a charlatan at times’, as well as ‘a parliamentary one-off' The granddaughter of Sir Winston Churchill has responded furiously to Jeremy Paxman’s suggestion that he would be unelectable in the modern age. Emma Soames, a journalist, said if the wartime Prime Minister had lived today he would win the public vote with his popular appeal and ‘genuine commitment to ordinary people’. Sir Winston was described by the former Newsnight presenter as a ‘a ruthless egotist, a chancer, and a charlatan at times’, as well as ‘a parliamentary one-off who’d be suffocated by the spinning and posturing that pass for politics today’. Mr Paxman added: ‘Would he be electable now? I fear not.’ But his granddaughter, 65, who was among members of the Churchill family who gathered yesterday for the launch of a series of events to remember his legacy of fighting fascism, said Mr Paxman himself was an ‘egotist’. ‘I just don’t think that’s true’, she said of his remarks. ‘I think Churchill’s virtues were so great…He came from this very ducal background but he felt himself to be very much connected to ordinary people, and I think that was genuine. 'I don’t think his understanding of them was so great but his consideration for them was immense. 'I think [Jeremy Paxman] has got it wrong.’ Asked whether he shared any qualities with Boris Johnson, who has written a critically acclaimed book about him called ‘The Churchill Factor’, she said: ‘Yes, journalistically, certainly and wit’. ‘In the same way that Boris (Johnson) is very popular, I think Churchill would be very popular because he had an amazing gift of the gab and a genuine commitment to ordinary people.’ She said her grandfather was ‘a genius and a giant of a man’. But she added: ‘It’s certainly true that Churchill was an egotist and I think Jeremy Paxman may easily be one too.’ Sir Winston's granddaughter, Emma Soames (pictured) a journalist, said if the wartime Prime Minister had lived today he would win the public vote with his popular appeal and ‘genuine commitment to ordinary people’ Her mother Lady Mary Soames was the fifth child of Sir Winston and his wife Clementine, who died last June aged 91, and her brother Nicholas Soames is a Tory MP and former minister. A week on Friday, on the fiftieth anniversary of his state funeral, surviving family members will board The Havengore, the vessel which carried his coffin down the Thames on its last journey from Tower Bridge to Festival Pier, near the Houses of Parliament. Leading a small flotilla, it will retrace the route taken on January 30, 1965 – when the funeral was watched on television by an estimated 350 million people worldwide. His descendants will then lay a wreath in the water near the Palace of Westminster before a special ceremony in Westminster Abbey. Sir David Cannadine, chair of the ‘Churchill 2015’ commemorations, also attacked Mr Paxman’s remarks, saying: ‘I don’t feel that it advances discussion of Churchill. 'It seems to me not helpful and I look forward to telling Jeremy that.’ This photo taken in 1951 shows Sir Winston Churchill holding his granddaughter Emma Soames on his knee . Mr Paxman had been speaking to the Radio Times ahead of a documentary he is presenting, marking the fiftieth anniversary of Sir Winston’s death. As well as the flotilla, throughout the year commemorative events will be held at his birthplace Blenheim Palace, the Churchill family home at Chartwell in Kent and the Science Museum. In a tribute read out at the launch yesterday, a message from David Cameron, read by his chief of staff, said: ‘Half a century after his death, Winston Churchill’s legacy continues to inspire not only the nation whose liberty he saved, but the entire world. 'His words and his actions reverberate through our national life today. ‘2015 is a year to remember Winston Churchill’s extraordinary life of achievement, to admire and to celebrate it anew and to give thanks for his service not only to the country he loved, but to humanity as a whole.’","Sir Winston Churchill's granddaughter has responded furiously to Paxman .

"After her husband died of cancer in 1997, a Florida woman decided to honour his wishes and live on the sea... permanently. Lee Wachtstetter, 86, sold her five-bedroom Fort Lauderdale home and moved to a stateroom aboard a luxury cruise ship. The widow, who often cruised with her husband during their 50-year-marriage, lived on a Holland America Line ship until it discontinued its dance host program. She then moved on to the Crystal Serenity and has been living on the 1,070-passenger ship for almost seven years. Scroll down for video . Lee Wachtstetter, who has been nicknamed Mama Lee, sold her five-bedroom Fort Lauderdale area home and moved aboard a luxury cruise ship after her husband died in 1997 . Mama Lee's husband Guy Mason Wachtstetter and military dog Tubby. Tubby was killed in action on Guam in 1944 and Mr Wachtstetter was  one of his Marine Corps dog handlers . Since setting saii, Mrs Wachtstetter has completed more than 200 cruises - including 15 round-the-world trips - taking in more than 100 countries. Some of the ship's 655 crew members took to calling her Mama Lee and the nickname has stuck. 'Nobody can pronounce my last name anyway, so it's fine with me,' she told the The News-Herald. Mrs Wachtstetter rarely goes ashore but does keep in touch with her family via computer, visiting them when the ship docks in Miami. She misses her three sons and seven grandchildren, but says 'they have families of their own and do what's right for them'. 'The day before my husband died of cancer in 1997, he told me, ""Don't stop cruising."" 'So here I am today living a stress-free, fairy-tale life,' the widow told the Asbury Park Press . 'I enjoy dancing, and this was the best of the remaining ships that still use dance hosts. 'My husband didn't dance, just didn't like to, and encouraged me to dance with the hosts. 'I dance every night for a couple hours after dinner.' Mrs Wachtstetter (above) picked the Serenity because she likes dancing and it 'was the best of the remaining ships that still use dance hosts' The Crystal Serenity can carry up to 1,070 passengers and has a crew of 655. It's been cruising for 11 years . Her husband, Guy Mason Wachtstetter, wasn't a dancer, but he was a fighter. Mr Wachtstetter married his wife in 1948, when she was still going by Leona instead of Lee. He served in the Second World War, the liberation of Guam and the Korean War and the former Marine Corps dog handler was 87 when he lost his battle with cancer. The week before his death, Mr Wachtstetter attended the 52nd Marine War Dog Reunion in Chicago even though his doctor told him he might not back it back. The life-long Florida resident was an Eagle Scout, coached Little League for many years and liked nothing more than taking cruises and being 'Grandpa', according to the Sun Sentinel. Mrs Wachtstetter has been living on the Crystal Serenity and enjoying the facilities aboard the ship for almost seven years . The 86-year-old will be paying $164,000 to live in a stateroom (model pictured above) on the ship this year . In addition to paying for dancing (seen above), Mrs Wachtstetter's bill covers her for room and board, lectures, movies and other activities . Mrs Wachtstetter believes that living on the Serenity this year will cost her around $164,000. That price includes her room, meals, beverages, dancing programs, entertainment, movies, lectures and cocktail parties with the captain. In addition to spending time dancing and taking part in other scheduled activities, Mrs Wachtstetter devotes some of her hours to doing needlepoint work in the ship's Palm Court lounge. She's been doing needlepoint about as long as she's been cruising and gives everything she makes to the Serenity's crew because it gives her 'great pleasure' and they are 'almost like family now'. Don't expect to see Miss Wachtstetter back on land to celebrate her 87th birthday in May - or any other subsequent birthday for that matter. She says she isn't sure if she would ever 'be able to readjust to the real world again' because she's spoiled and that the 'crew members bend over backwards' to keep her happy. However, if the Serenity is docking in Istanbul on the big day, the birthday girl might not be able to resist going ashore. She finds the 'gorgeously glitzy' outfits at the Grand Bazaar irresistible - especially because they are well-suited for ballroom dancing.","Lee Wachtstetter lives on the Crystal Serenity and rarely goes ashore .

Prosecutor Max Cook said the age of the case and issues with witness availability were factors in the decision to offer the plea deal, which he called the best resolution for the victims' families. Noe was tied to the murders of her former daughter-in-law 23-year-old Wendy Camp; Camp's 6-year-old daughter, Cynthia Britto; and Camp's sister-in-law, 22-year-old Lisa Kregear. District Attorney Richard Smothermon declined to discuss the case. 'I can't comment on plea negotiations,' he said Monday. Noe's attorney did not immediately return phone calls seeking comment. Camp had been married to Noe's son, Chad Noe, and they had a son together. She, her daughter and sister-in-law had traveled from her home in Oklahoma City on May 29, 1992, to visit the boy named Jonathon, who was staying with his father in Shamrock. Beverly Noe, 67, was expected to be offered an unspecified plea deal in the 1992 slaying of two women and a 6-year-old child . WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT Back in 1992, Noe's mother Ida Prewitt allegedly told her son and Noe's brother to fill a hole dug for a septic tank and cover it with pepper to mask any odor. Mr. Prewitt approached authorities over 20 years later to tell them about the hole, where the bodies were subsequently found . Slain: Noe is charged with three counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of her former daughter-in-law 23-year-old Wendy Camp (left); Camp's 6-year-old daughter, Cynthia Britto (right); and Camp's sister-in-law, 22-year-old Lisa Kregear (center) Investigators allege that Noe, 67, of the central Oklahoma town of Bristow, killed Camp because she feared Camp would take her young grandson away from her. Noe wanted custody of Jonathon, according to the probable cause affidavit. 'Beverly had always wanted, and tried to get, custody of Jonathon,' special agent Marty Wilson of the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation wrote in the affidavit. According to Tulsa World, Beverly Noe and her son believed Jonathon's new step-dad was molesting him. Beverly Noe would tell investigators after her arrest that Camp's daughter Cynthia Britto had to die because she, too, had been molested and was 'damaged goods.' 20 years later: Beverly Noe's brother Grover Prewitt Jr. told investigators in 2013 about the day his mother Ida Prewitt told him to fill a hole he'd dug on their property for a septic tank . Ida Prewitt, who died in 2011, was reportedly involved in the murders at least to the extent that she instructed her son to cover the bodies . After the three disappeared, Beverly Noe acknowledged being the last person to see them alive. She told investigators she dropped them off at a Wal-Mart in Chandler after getting into a fight with Camp. The bodies were found in 2013 after Noe's brother, Grover Prewitt Jr. directed authorities to the property that he and his mother Ida Prewitt owned at the time. Prewitt told investigators he had dug the hole for a septic tank after his mother, Ida Prewitt, bought five of his 40 acres and moved a trailer onto the property. He said his mother then suddenly told him to fill the hole. 'Grover asked her why, to which Ida responded, 'Because there's a couple of dead bodies in there',' the special agent, wrote. Grover Prewitt said he didn't ask questions and with a backhoe operator closed the hole. According to an affidavit, Prewitt's mother asked him to sprinkle the ground with pepper to cover up any odor. Ida Prewitt died in 2011. Besides leading authorities to the hole, Mr. Prewitt also gave them a sawed-off 12-gauge shotgun, which family members called 'Baby,' according to the affidavit. Autopsies showed Camp and her sister-in-law were shot. Camp also was stabbed. The 6-year-old girl died of 'unspecified means.' Investigators say Grover Prewitt talked to his sister, Beverly Noe, about giving authorities the shotgun and his .357-caliber revolver. He was wearing a wire at the time. Beverly Noe previously told The Associated Press she didn't know how the three could have been found on the property 21 years after their disappearance. 'I figure somebody picked them up, but I don't have a clue who,' Noe said then. 'I don't know how they got back to his property. I would wonder how they got there. I really don't know how they got there. It is odd. I'd agree to that.' Grover Prewitt is charged as an accessory and has pleaded not guilty in the case.

"Katie Hopkins installs fear in the hearts of millions – the acid-tongued star even turned the original ice queen Katie Price into a meek woman on the current series of Celebrity Big Brother, despite the glamour model insisting there would be fireworks between them. But there is ONE person in this world who can control the notoriously outspoken star – her husband Marl Cross – a design manager so quiet and kind that he is known to friends and family as ‘Lovely Mark’. In an interview with FEMAIL, Katie reveals that while she refuses to listen to anyone, even her own children, she bows down to her 50-year-old husband in every argument. Scroll down for video . Katie Hopkins met Mark Cross (pictured) while he was still with his first wife Ruth. The couple married in 2010 and have one child together. She says he is the nicest man in the world and her total opposite. She said: ‘He is probably the only person on the planet that can control me, weirdly, because whatever he says is going to be right and there is no escaping that. ‘If he was an a***hole you could just ignore it but he's not.’ The couple met in 2006 while working at the Met Office together and first got together in 2007, shortly after Katie had appeared on BBC1 show The Apprentice. At the time, Katie was newly-divorced from her first husband Damian McKinney and Mark was still in a seven-year marriage with his first wife Ruth. The romance came to light after the couple were caught having sex in a field and the pictures were splashed across the pages of a national tabloid the next day. Katie and Mark pictured having a passionate moment in a field in 2007 . Katie first became a household name after appearing on the Apprentice in 2007. She had a fling with one of the other contestants Paul Callaghan but he dumped her after finding out about her affair with Mark . Unsurprisingly, Mark’s first marriage failed to survive the indiscretion and he split from Ruth soon after. He and Katie then started dating and he soon moved into the Exeter home she shared with her two children from her first marriage, India and Poppy. Then in 2008, their son Max, now six, was born. Two years later, the pair married in a barn on an episode of Celebrity Four Weddings, alongside Lizzie Cundy, comic Francine Lewis and ex-popstar David Van Day. In a recent documentary that saw Katie gain and lose several stone in six months, her husband Mark was often seen comforting his wife at her lowest ebb, as she tearfully talked to him in a baby voice. It was a startling change to the TV personality, who mainly appears on camera delivering nasty put-downs to her opponents with a steely glare. Katie is now appearing on our screens in Celebrity Big Brother . Katie has reduced many of her CBB housemates to tears on the programme with her sharp tongue . Blogger Perez Hilton has often become embroiled in heated arguments with Katie in the house . And Katie admits that even her in-laws can’t believe that her husband has chosen to settle down with her. In an interview with MailOnline just before she went onto the Channel 4 reality show earlier this month, she said: ‘Mark is genuinely the polar opposite of me and everyone says that. ‘He's known as “Lovely Mark,” which really gets on my t***, everyone says to me with a look of horror, ""What, you're married to lovely Mark?"" ‘His relatives in Australia actually said to me at Christmas, “It's a surprise that you're married to our Mark.” ‘He is genuinely the nicest man on the planet. Not in a wet way though.’ Mark and Katie have one child together, Max, and the couple live with her two children from her previous marriage in a large town house in Exeter. Katie claims that she is happier that she has ever been in her life and puts the emotions down to her marriage. She says Mark has shown her a new way to live – one that involves less aggro – and while she might not take it fully on-board, some of it has seeped into her behaviour. Katie with Mark back in 2008 . The personality that made her famous often sees her battle against everyone from celebrities on This Morning to mums at the school gate, but Katie admits that Mark is her opposite in every way. She said: ‘He'll do all of the things that grown-ups tell you to do. Like for instance, if someone p***** you off on an email - I would just fire one right back or even highlight their own failings. ‘Mark would do the sensible thing, which is wait two days and then reply in a thought-out and thoroughly sensible manner. ‘He'll take the time to listen to what the kids are saying and respond in a grown up manner. ‘He encourages them to have their own points of view and feelings about things and their own responses. ‘I don't have time for any of that. I just shout what I think and that's that. ‘But that is Mark. I can’t even imagine what he has to say about me, but whatever it is, he would be truthful.’ Katie with her three children (left to right: India, Max and Poppy) Katie is famous for her bust-ups with celebrities on the This Morning sofa, including an explosive row with the late Peaches Geldof . It is the fact that he is so different from her that Katie believes the marriage has worked. She said: ‘I married myself with my first husband, he would agree entirely I'm sure. But that didn't work at all. ‘And so with Mark I have married my polar opposite - he wears soft shoes, he has an earring, he has a skull as a wedding ring and he's a designer. ‘I mean, you couldn't be more opposite. And that seems to have worked. ‘I don't know how or why, but I think it is because he can tell me when I have gone over the line. ‘And obviously he does that on a daily basis.’ Much like Mark, Katie’s first husband Damian was married when they first met in 2003. Damian, a Major in the Royal Marines, had been pensioned off because of arthritis and had built a hugely successful management consultancy called McKinney Rogers in Bicton, Devon. Katie joined the firm as a junior client co-ordinator in 2000 and quickly rose through the ranks, being promoted to head of the US office within 18 months. She and Damian then started up a relationship and things quickly became serious, leading to him leaving his wife Tina. Katie has recently claimed that Damian had split from his wife when they started dating, but his wife Tina is adamant that is not the case. Damian McKinney pictured with his son Alexander, from his first marriage to Tina McKinney, which ended when he started dating Katie . Damian’s divorce from Tina was finalised in May 2003 and that autumn Katie announced she was pregnant. The couple married in September 2004, four months after the birth of their daughter India, now nine years old. The couple went on to have a second child together called Poppy, now seven, in 2006, but Katie has since claimed that by then Damian was having an affair with another work colleague and left her soon after the birth. The couple have an amicable relationship for the sake of their children, but Katie recently acknowledged that the incident made her appreciate her relationship with her now-husband so much more and revealed that although she bounced back from her last marriage, Mark having an affair would break her. She also told Now magazine that she would no longer ever consider having an affair, despite admitting to having them in the past. She said ‘I would never cheat on my husband now. ‘There’s too much at stake. When you have a family, you can’t think like a single person any more. ‘There are too many little hearts to look after. I couldn’t look at my kids if I’d let them down like this - it would be too big a price to pay.’","Katie Hopkins met Mark Cross while he was still with his first wife Ruth .

"Product criticism: Alan Titchmarsh pictured in a publicity photograph for his Waitrose gardening line . For many of us, Alan Titchmarsh is the go-to gardening expert, a font of knowledge about making things grow. But when it comes to making compost, it seems he is not quite the master we might assume. Consumer magazine Which? Gardening has condemned his commercial Peat-Free Multi Purpose Compost - part of a gardening line recently launched by Waitrose - as a product to stay away from. In a review of 25 composts, Which? gave Mr Titchmarsh’s £3.50 30-litre bag a ‘Don’t Buy’ label. Experts gave his compost poor scores for seed sowing and raising young plants. They said tomatoes, pansies, basil plants and pelargoniums all did badly in trials. Ceri Thomas, editor of Which? Gardening, said on Twitter that the reviews revealed a ‘shocking difference between a Best Buy compost and a Don’t Buy’. Mr Titchmarsh, 65, who made his name as a television presented in the 1980s on the long-running BBC Nationwide, last night rejected the criticism. In a statement sent by his agent, he said: ‘The results obtained by Which? magazine do not accord with my own experiences at home which prove this compost to be the best peat-free mix I have ever used. ‘That’s why I was - and am - happy to it my name to it. Perhaps other gardeners are best advised to try it and make their own judgements.’ Badly rated: In a review of 25 composts, Which? gave Mr Titchmarsh’s £3.50 30-litre bag (pictured) a ‘Don’t Buy’ label. Experts gave his compost poor scores for seed sowing and raising young plants . Waitrose, which launched a gardening range fronted by Mr Titchmarsh in Spring 2013, also disputed the scores. A spokesman for the supermarket said: ‘We were very disappointed to read the review as it doesn’t reflect what we see in our own and independent stringent quality control testing or the positive feedback we receive from our customers. ‘We work with a leading compost manufacturer and pride ourselves on providing consistently outstanding composts and we’ll investigate these results further.’ Gardeners are divided about the strengths and weaknesses of peat-free compost. Waitrose, which launched a gardening range fronted by Mr Titchmarsh in Spring 2013, disputed the scores . Environmentalists insist we stop using any peat in our gardens, because digging it up for commercial use is destroying the moors where it comes from. While many experts say peat-free compost is just as good as traditional peat mixes, others say decomposed bark and green waste is too coarse to germinate seeds well. The BBC was criticised in 2013 for allowing Mr Titchmarsh to present Chelsea Flower Show coverage while being the face of Waitrose, a sponsor at the event. He was dropped the next year, in favour of Monty Don. Mr Titchmarsh said later: ‘Yes, I suppose I was hurt, because I know people enjoy you doing it as much as I loved doing it.’","Which?

"Human cannonball Matthew Cranch, 24, as killed when the safety net intended to break his fall after he was fired into the air collapsed . The death of a 'human cannonball' who died after being fired into the air at a stunt show has been ruled an accident, an inquest has ruled. Matthew Cranch suffered multiple injuries after a safety net intended to break his fall collapsed as he fell to the ground on April 25, 2011. The 24-year-old had been fired from a lorry-mounted cannon during Scott May's Daredevil Stunt Show at the Kent County Showground in Detling. An inquest, sitting at Archbishop's Palace, Maidstone, heard that a mechanism which triggered the release of the safety net was not properly set. Tests carried out following the tragedy showed the mechanism could be unintentionally falsely closed, leading to the net dropping when the lorry recoiled upon firing of the cannon. In her closing remarks to jurors before they retired, Mid Kent and Medway coroner Patricia Harding said it was 'undoubtedly a tragic case' but she urged them to be dispassionate. She said: 'This is not a trial. It's an inquest into a death, a fact-finding mission to find out how Mr Cranch died. There is no indictment, no criminal charge.' In its conclusion, the jury said: 'At some point during the firing of the cannonball, the safety net quick release mechanism activated prematurely as a result of it being incorrectly set. 'As a result, Matthew Cranch sustained multiple injuries.' Mr Cranch, who was living in Cornwall, had performed the showpiece five times before the tragedy and had joined the stunt team just one week before his death. Kent Police announced in December 2012 that no criminal prosecution would be brought over Mr Cranch's death. Scroll down for video . Mr Cranch is seen climbing into the cannon before carrying out the daredevil stunt on April 25, 2011 . He gives a 'thumbs up' sign as he climbs into the cannon at the stunt show at the Kent County Showground . In footage shown at the inquest, one of Mr Cranch's colleagues was heard giving a '3, 2, 1' countdown on the public address system before he shouted 'fire'. Mr Cranch could then be seen being propelled from the cannon amid a cloud of pyrotechnic smoke as the safety net in front of him suddenly collapsed. He later died at Maidstone Hospital. Mechanical engineer Alex Grimes, tested the safety net trigger mechanism and found that when the latch was fully closed, the net could not be released. But on a third occasion he engineered the mechanism so that it was falsely closed. On this occasion, the safety net did release when the vehicle recoiled as the cannon fired. Pictures taken of the mechanism several months after Mr Cranch's death showed a build-up of dirt and grease on it. Mr Grimes said that dirt or grit could have impacted on the mechanism's performance, but he could not confirm whether this contributed to the failing or not. Mr Cranch suffered multiple injuries when he plunged to the ground after being fired from this cannon . In footage shown at the inquest, one of Mr Cranch's colleagues was heard giving a '3, 2, 1' countdown on the public address system before he shouted 'fire' Mr Cranch, who was living in Cornwall, had performed the showpiece five times before the tragedy and had joined the stunt team just a month before his death . A second expert, Charles Simmons-Jacobs, a specialist inspector in mechanical engineering, said it appeared the trigger had not been set 'to the end of its travel'. Stunt show employees, including Tommy Austin, who set up the trigger mechanism on the safety net on the day, told the inquest they were not aware the mechanism could be set in a falsely closed position. Tony Nicholls, the chief mechanic at Stunts UK Ltd, and the man who fired Mr Cranch from the cannon on the day of the tragedy, said he heard the click of the net release mechanism just after Mr Cranch was sent flying through the air. Mr Nicholls, who has no formal mechanical qualifications but has years of experience, was asked how he would ensure that the lug engaged with the latch. He told the inquest: 'For me, it was the noise, like a car door when you hear it has been engaged.' Whenever he set the mechanism, Mr Nicholls said he would do so using force 'to make sure it was in every time'. Mr Nicholls said the trigger release mechanism, which was partly in a sealed unit, was routinely pressure washed, lubricated using WD40 and checked for fatigue. He said there were equipment checks before each performance and more in-depth maintenance during breaks between performances. As Mr Cranch was fired out of the cannon, the net collapsed, causing him to land on the ground . Expert Charles Simmons-Jacobs, a specialist inspector in mechanical engineering, said it appeared the trigger had not been set 'to the end of its travel' In her closing remarks to jurors before they retired, Mid Kent and Medway coroner Patricia Harding said it was 'undoubtedly a tragic case' but she urged them to be dispassionate . At the time of Mr Cranch's death, his friends described him as a 'thrill-seeker' who opted out of his promising academic career and his conventional middle-class upbringing . Motorcycle stuntman Scott May said said the showpiece stunt had been performed about 1,000 times . The tragedy happened in front of the assembled crowds who had paid £12 to see the stunt show . Mr Cranch had suffered serious injuries to his heart, head and chest and died in the ambulance after suffering a cardiac arrest two minutes before arriving at hospital, the inquest was told . Kent Police announced in December 2012 that no criminal prosecution would be brought over the incident . Asked whether he had ever encountered problems with the net release trigger mechanism not setting properly, he replied: 'No, never.' Scott May, he owner and managing director of family-run Stunts UK Ltd, said training to use the device involved employees watching senior colleagues doing it before performing it themselves under supervision, then on their own. Mr May said the showpiece stunt had been performed around 1,000 times with no issue. He said: 'Any faults that are found results in equipment being taken out and rectified and put back in the show.' Tony Nicholls, chief mechanic at Stunts UK Ltd, said safety was a 'top priority' and if anyone voiced concerns about safety, a stunt would not go ahead until it had been put right. Mr Cranch's parents Michael Michael and Pauline and his sister Eleanor attended the hearing.","Matthew Cranch died after being fired from a cannon in April 2011 .

"Clash: Goldman Sachs is facing claims that it duped Libyan officials in Colonel Gaddafi’s regime into investing almost £800m. Above, Colonel Gaddafi . Goldman Sachs is facing extraordinary claims that it duped Libyan officials in Colonel Gaddafi’s brutal regime into investing almost £800million by plying them with girls, lavish parties and luxury trips. The world’s most powerful investment bank is facing a bruising High Court battle with Libya’s giant sovereign wealth fund, set up in 2006 to invest the country’s oil riches after economic sanctions were lifted. The Libyan Investment Authority claims Goldman Sachs abused the financial illiteracy and trust of Gaddafi-era officials by persuading them to invest in complex financial instruments during the financial crisis. The investments were linked to companies whose share price crashed, including US bank Citigroup and French energy giant EDF. They proved a disaster for the Gaddafi regime, leaving it with losses of £660million, while Goldman raked in profits of more than £200million. The Wall Street giant has faced embarrassing accusations from one witness for the LIA, Catherine McDougall, an Australian lawyer who advised the fund at the time. She alleged that Goldman, spearheaded by former executive Youssef Kabbaj, courted financially illiterate LIA officials by taking them to expensive clubs in London and on a ‘lavish trip to Morocco’ that included ‘heavy drinking and girls.’ In one email exchange, Mr Kabbaj – who left Goldman in 2009 – told an LIA employee to ‘divorce your wife for the weekend’. Goldman has denied any wrongdoing. It will say that following an ‘extensive review of expenses related to LIA’, the total amount claimed by Youssef Kabbaj in 2007 and 2008 was around £50,000. It said most lunches were either in Goldman Sachs canteens or in ‘standard business restaurants’ generally charging $100 a head. According to the bank, Mr Kabbaj did accompany LIA officials on business trips to several countries, including a ‘handful of dinners’ during two trips. But it added they were ‘entirely normal dinners at respectable, traditional restaurants.’ The trial, which is expected to take place next year, will also see Goldman go head to head with Sofia Wellesley, the granddaughter of the Duke of Wellington and the wife of pop star James Blunt. Claims: The Libyan Investment Authority claims Goldman Sachs abused the financial illiteracy and trust of Gaddafi-era officials by persuading them to invest in complex financial instruments during the financial crisis . Written arguments submitted by the LIA have quoted a 2007 email sent by Ms Wellesley, who previously worked for the fund, suggesting that the Libyan officials were no match for the razor sharp minds working for Goldman Sachs. She said LIA was ‘staffed by a team of clearly naïve, unqualified individuals…doing their best in the face of extremely intelligent, ambitions and experienced individuals’ But Goldman has claimed the trades ‘were not difficult to understand’ and there is ‘no suggestion that the LIA lacked sophistication to make those investment decisions.’ Its lawyer has described the allegations about corporate hospitality as ‘tittle tattle.’","Goldman Sachs facing High Court battle with Libya's sovereign wealth fund .

"A New Jersey woman unable to afford gender reassignment surgery is planning a move to Britain so she can claim the operation for free on the taxpayer-funded NHS. Giana Lopez, 25, has been taking female hormones for the past four years and has had an operation to have her testicles removed, but is unable to afford full reassignment surgery under the costly U.S. healthcare system. She is now planning a move to the UK where she will qualify to receive the surgery under the NHS after working for 12 months, The Sun reported. Scroll down for video . Giana Lopez (pictured) is planning a move to Britain so she can receive taxpayer-funded gender surgery . Here Miss Lopez is pictured left as a schoolboy, and again right after transitioning to a woman . At age 18, she came out to friends and family as gay - but three years later, decided to transition, according to the paper. The makeup artist, who runs her own YouTube channel, is currently applying for jobs in London. She could have the option of receiving a two-year working visa or being employed by a U.S. company which can transfer her to its British offices. She said that, aside from Canada the British NHS healthcare system offered the best deal for receiving the treatment. 'If I live in the UK for a year I can get the free surgery,' she said. 'I know the good people of Britain won't mind funding my dream - I need it just as much as anyone else.' The surgery, which would cost between £15,000 and £20,000 in the U.S., is provided  for any individual who is already entitled to free treatment on the NHS. She added: 'The UK's free healthcare entitles me to this, so of course I'm going to take up the opportunity.' MailOnline has requested comment from the NHS. Miss Lopez (pictured as a young man) has been taking female hormones for the past four years . Here she is pictured as a young boy. She came out as gay when she was 18, but three years later, realised she wanted to become a woman . Miss Lopez (pictured left and right) said she 'knows the good people of Britain' won't mind funding her gender reassignment surgery which she can receive for free under the NHS . Meanwhile, the NHS' top doctor claims the service is 'not fit for the future' and unless it undergoes radical change may be forced to abandon free healthcare for all. Medical director of NHS England Professor Sir Bruce Keogh said the NHS must become far less reliant on hospitals and needed a ‘complete transformation’ of the way it operates. In order for the NHS to keep itself sustainable, he said, more services need to happen under the same roof – for example diagnostics tests and an expanded range of treatments at GP surgeries. Sir Bruce told The Guardian: ‘If not, we will get to a place where the NHS becomes unaffordable and we will have to make some very difficult decisions which will get to the very heart of the principle of the NHS and its values. ‘This will open up a whole series of discussions about whether the NHS is fit for purpose, whether it’s affordable, and whether the compact with the citizen of free healthcare for all is sustainable in the longer term.’ He added: ‘Too many patients find the NHS fragmented (and) confusing. They find that they get pushed from pillar to post; they feel like a ball in a pinball machine at times.’","Giana Lopez, 25, is planning a move to Britain to claim NHS gender surgery .

"Burger chain Shake Shack, which got its start as a hot dog cart in New York City, plans to raise up to $80 million from an initial public offering of its common stock. The company said Tuesday that it anticipates its IPO of 5 million shares pricing between $14 and $16 per share. Last month Shake Shack Inc. disclosed in a regulatory filing that it was hoping to raise up to $100 million from its IPO, but it didn't say how many shares it planned to offer or at what price, so the figure was subject to change. Shake Shack pictured in New York's theater district - the burger chain got its start as a single hot dog cart . Shake Shack said that it plans to give the underwriters the option to buy up to 750,000 additional shares of its stock. The origins of the restaurant date to 2001, when privately held Union Square Hospitality Group, a company owned by restaurateur Danny Meyer, opened a hot dog cart in Manhattan's Madison Square Park. Three years later a more permanent kiosk opened in the same park. It now has 63 locations in nine countries, according to a Tuesday regulatory filing. Shake Shack said that after the offering it will be a separate company from Union Square Hospitality Group. In 2013, Shake Shack had revenue of $84.5 million, up 45 percent from the year before. It posted a profit of $5.4 million in 2013, up 31 percent from 2012. Shake Shack cooks its burgers to order and promotes its use of natural ingredients, including hormone- and antibiotic-free beef. It's known for its long lines and its vibrating pagers that signal when an order is ready. The chain calls its restaurants 'shacks,' and uses the word to describe its menu items. The ShackBurger, for example, is topped with ShackSauce and a hot dog is named the Shack-cago Dog. Other fast-casual restaurant operators have fared well after their IPOs, including chicken chain El Pollo Loco Holdings Inc. and Mediterranean-style restaurant chain Zoe's Kitchen Inc. Shake Shack expects to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the 'SHAK' ticker symbol.","Shake Shack started as a hot dog cart in NYC in 2001 .

"For most people, Kirby vacuum cleaners are nothing more than a household necessity. But for Dylan Greene, who has autism, they are his greatest passion - and have been for 12 years. So, for his 14th birthday, the teenager's mother decided to do something extra special to celebrate. Jodie Greene, from Chesterfield County, Virginia, sent an email to the Kirby Company - the Cleveland-based makers of the Kirby vacuum - explaining how her son had never been into 'normal' toys. Heartwarming: On his 14th birthday, Dylan Greene (right), who has autism, was treated to a Kirby vacuum cleaner demonstration by the firm's salesman Al Archie (left) at his home in Chesterfield County, Virginia . Birthday wish: Dylan (center) poses with his sister, Mr Archie and a vacuum-themed cake after the demo . In it, she wrote: 'I am reaching out to you in hopes for an answer to an unusual request for my son who is autistic. He has always been obsessed with vacuum cleaners. His favorite is the Kirby. 'He spends hours every day watching videos on his tablet about different Kirbys. When he isn’t watching videos, he is talking about them. I really would LOVE to get a demo done for him for his birthday. I am writing to you in hopes that you can get me in touch with a way to get him this demo.' The mother-of-two went on to explain that she did not intend to buy a Kirby - but hoped she may be able to pay a flat fee or host salesmen who needed to conduct practice demos for training purposes. 'I do not want anything free, but as the mother of a special needs child, it is so hard to find things to make my son happy,' she said. 'I know that having this demo done would just be so awesome, and it would warm my heart to see him so excited to experience that.' Ecstatic: Later in the day, Mr Archie - who has been selling vacuums for the Kirby Company for a quarter of his century - presented a joyful Dylan with his best gift of all: A brand new Kirby vacuum cleaner (pictured) Devoted mother: Jodie Greene (pictured with Dylan and her daughter) had sent an email to the Kirby Company prior to Dylan's birthday, explaining how her son had never been into 'normal' toys, only vacuums . Ms Greene's heartfelt email did not go unnoticed by the company - not only did its bosses gift Dylan with a Kirby-branded soccer ball, hat and T-shirt, they also sent salesman Al Archie to his house. On his birthday, the teenager and his family and friends were treated to a vacuum demonstration from Mr Archie, who had traveled from Fredericksburg to fulfill Dylan's wish, according to WTVR. And after his demonstration, the salesman - who has been selling vacuums for Kirby for a quarter of his century - presented Dylan with his best gift of all: A brand new Kirby vacuum cleaner. 'At the end of the demonstration [he] gave my son a brand new Kirby vacuum,' Ms Greene, who also made a vacuum birthday cake for Dylan, said. 'There was not a dry eye in the house.' Making an impact: 'At the end of the demo [he] gave my son a brand new Kirby vacuum,' Ms Greene (left), said. 'There was not a dry eye in the house.' Right, Dylan has apparently been 'over the moon' ever since . Speaking after his demonstration, Mr Archie said he had arranged for Dylan to receive the vacuum cleaner because he was touched by the Swift Creek Middle School student's passion for them. 'I wanted to do something for him,' he said. '[It was] an opportunity to give something back.' He added that the teenager had impressed him by 'knowing more about the Kirby than I did.' Kirby vacuum cleaners can typically cost from $400 upward.

"The health care worker who returned from Sierra Leone and sparked a Ebola scare in the U.S. after she was pulled off a United Airlines flight at Newark does not have Ebola. The woman, whose name has not been released, reportedly vomited aboard United flight 45 from Brussels and suffered from a high fever and was taken to Hackensack Medical Center. But a spokesman for Hackensack Medical Center said in a statement despite her symptoms she has been declared 'Ebola free.' Health workers in hazmat suits met the passenger on the plane at Newark Liberty International Airport on Monday afternoon . The woman was taken off and sent to Hackensack University Medical Center, whe she was tested for Ebola and was being held on Tuesday . Doctors said when the woman arrived at the hospital she was not showing signs of infection. And despite preliminary tests indicating she did not have the virus, she was kept overnight into Tuesday 'in an abundance of caution' and released from the hospital in the evening. Hackensack University Medical Center is one of the state's three hospitals which is 'Ebola ready' and able to tackle  cases of the deadly virus. Eyewitnesses said the emergency room entrance was blocked off as a precaution as the patient was evaluated overnight. The Bergen County Record reported that the woman was returning to the US from Sierra Leone, a West African nation where health workers are still working to bring Ebola under control. The virus has infected an estimated 10,000 people there and killed more than 3,000. The woman is reportedly a health worker who was returning from the Ebola-afflicted nation of Sierra Leone in West Africa . Passengers told the Record that healthcare workers in hazmat suits met the plane when it landed about 2pm on Monday. E.E. Charlton-Trujillo, who was on the flight, said neither airline officials nor health authorities offered an explanation for what happened on the plane, but fear quickly spread through the cabin. 'Everyone's thinking Ebola,' she told the Record. A Twitter user on board the plane said authorities had passengers fill out health forms and that responders were in hazardous materials suits. There were 248 passengers and 14 crew members on United Airlines Flight 45 from Brussels, a spokesman said. At present, passengers flying into either Newark or John F. Kennedy airports from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea have their temperature taken. This is done with the use of no-touch thermometers upon landing and they are then monitored for symptoms for 21 days. Authorities stressed that even  it was highly unlikely that the woman would have infected anyone else aboard the plane. Doctors say the woman no longer had a fever when she arrived at Hackensack University Medical Center . Passengers were given health forms to fill out and told the contact health officials if they experienced any symptoms of the virus . Flight: Luke Punzenberger, a spokesman for United said that a passenger had become ill on a flight that arrived in Newark from Brussels on Monday afternoon . Despite sporadic scares of possible Ebola cases in the tri-state in recent months, to date,  only one person, Dr. Craig Spencer from Manhattan, has been diagnosed with the virus in the tri state area. He was successfully treated at Bellevue Hospital in early November after returning from Guinea while working with Doctors Without Borders. Yesterday, Luke Punzenberger, a spokesman for United said that a passenger had become ill on a flight that arrived in Newark from Brussels on Monday afternoon. He told CNN: 'After arriving at Newark airport from Brussels, medical personnel met a United flight to assist an ill passenger on board. 'Passengers and crew stayed on the plane until the medical personnel cleared the aircraft.' As of this month, the World Health Organization says at least 8,594 people have died in the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. In Liberia there were 3,587 deaths. Sierra Leone had 3,132 deaths and Guinea 1,875 deaths. The current outbreak, which began about a year ago, has also claimed more than a dozen lives elsewhere. The death toll from the current Ebola outbreak has reached 8,594 people with as many as 21,614 infected according to the World Health Organization. It describes Ebola symptoms as the sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. This is followed by vomiting, diarrhea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding. The infection is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, bodily fluids and tissues of infected animals or people. And people remain infectious as long as their blood and secretions contain the virus. There is no known cure or vaccine for the disease but the incubation period is two to 21 days. A burial team from the Liberian health department removes the body of a woman suspected of dying of the Ebola virus, the African country has reported the highest numbers of deaths from the virus . Survivors: Pictured with Matt Lauer from left to right are Ebola survivors Amber Vinson, Dr. Kent Brantly, Nina Pham, Nancy Writebol, Dr. Rick Sacra, and Ashoka Mukpo as they appeared on the Today show . Most Ebola cases are in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Liberia has had 3,587 deaths, Sierra Leone 3,132 deaths and Guinea 1,875 deaths. However, there have also been cases reported in Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Spain, Great Britain and the United States. The current outbreak, which began about a year ago has claimed more than a dozen lives elsewhere. In the U.S. at least 10 people, mostly health care workers have been treated and only two of those patients have died. The American Ebola Survivors include: Amber Vinson, Dr. Kent Brantly, Nina Pham, Nancy Writebol, Dr. Rick Sacra, and Ashoka Mukpo.","The passenger was taken to Hackensack University Medical Center Monday .

"Two hundred people including 12 children have been diagnosed with HIV after being treated by an unlicenced doctor in Cambodia. Medic Yem Chrin, who made house calls for nearly two decades in the remote rice farming village of Roka, has been arrested after police say he admitted to reusing needles and syringes. Among the infected are 16 members of the same extended family, along with the 82-year-old abbot of a nearby Buddhist monastery.Medic Yem Chrin . Medic Yem Chrin has been arrested after 200 people were diagnosed with HIV in the remote Cambodian village of Roka (pictured, Em Mom, one of those infected with HIV, prepares to take her medication) Medics in Roka (pictured) began noticing unexplained cases of HIV last August, but  the true scale of the infection was only uncovered recently. Police say Chrin has admitted to reusing needles and syringes . Mr. Chrin, who trained as a nurse treating people at a refugee camp after the fall of the Khmer Rouge regime which killed nearly two million people, is currently being held in nearby Battambang. He has been charged with aggravated murder, intentionally spreading HIV, and is accused of practicing without a licence. The tragedy in Roka, a remote village which is three miles from the nearest paved road, first came to light in August last year when a pregnant woman showed positive for HIV during a routine test. Medics were unable to explain the infection, but after another expectant mother also tested positive a few weeks later, medical centres were inundated with villagers asking to be screened. At the time the country's Prime Minister refused to accept the results as genuine, saying he was '100 per cent' sure it was not HIV. But he was to be proved tragically wrong. More positive results flooded in and the centres were filled with people weeping and hugging each other, reports the New York Times. Grandmother Chem Mao, 55, even considered committing suicide after her diagnosis, but as she arrived home the sight of her grandchildren playing beside her cinder-block house stopped her. Despite the horrific infection sweeping through the village, many locals have staunchly defended Chrin, describing him as a philanthropic man willing to step in during times of need. Roka is a small rice farming community in Cambodia's west, which is three miles from the nearest paved road. Here Em Seiha (left), who is among those infected, goes to work in the fields . Among the infected are 12 children, the 82-year-old abbot of the local Buddhist monastery, and 16 members of the same family. Despite the scale of the outbreak, many villagers stood by Chrin . Chhay Yao, 76, the head of the family in which 16 people were infected, said: 'Honestly I don't think the doctor caused this. 'He was so clean. And he's not a bad person. If we had money we gave it to him. If not he would always say, pay me later.' According to Chrin's daughter, Chrin Reaksa, he moved to the region after his time in refugee camps, and the villagers began coming to him for help. After a while, he established a practice to deal with the number of requests. Locals said he was always willing to help, offering free treatment if they couldn't pay. Ms Reaska said that, before the infection, officials never asked her father about a licence. While the quality of healthcare in rural Cambodia has been described as 'poor' by the World Health Organisation, it has also been praised for its efforts in reducing the spread of HIV and Aids. Rates of infection in the far eastern country are a third lower than those in neighbouring Thailand, and cases of mass infection such as this are rare. Cambodia's government has been criticised for its treatment of HIV/Aids sufferers. In 2009, families infected with the virus were forcibly moved into huts in a de-facto commune in Tuol Sambo (pictured) In September last year there were still 50 families living in the commune, which has poor access to water, a single shop (pictured) and a lone medical centre . The government has a widespread programme of providing free antiretroviral drugs to those suffering from the life-limiting infection, and has stepped in to provide them in Roka. Despite this, villagers have reported being treated like outcasts, shunned by those from surrounding towns, and forced to wash their hands with disinfectant whenever they visit public buildings. In the past Cambodia's government has been criticised for its treatment of those infected with HIV/Aids after it created a de-facto commune for families suffering from the illness. In 2009 Amnesty International blasted the Cambodian government after it moved 20 infected families living in the Phnom Penh area into green shacks built in Tuol Sambo. Villagers around Tuol Sambo were quoted as saying the settelment was built as a centre for those with the virus, and Amnesty warned that a lack of heating, sanitation and access to clean water would likely endanger the health of those sent there. Around 50 families were still living in the metal huts in September last year, and were entirely dependent on one clinic for their medication, which is handed out free of charge once a week.","Around 200 people infected in poor, remote rice farming village of Roka .

"Many unlucky dog owners know just how hard a task it can be to get their pets settled into the back of the car for a peaceful ride. Getting them out at the end, on the other hand, is the easy part. This was not the case for one Floridian woman, whose hard-headed drive-loving dog refused to budge once she parked her vehicle. Scroll down for video . Crystal Felmly practically had to get down on all fours and beg her 3-year-old Belgian Malinois mix to 'get out of the car' after their journey home to Carrollwood in Tampa, Florida. However, Tank proved just how far he was willing to go to press her buttons. In the video, the furry monster can be seen jumping across the seats in a bid to stay put while Crystal grows increasingly frustrated. At first she is amused by his cunning plan and instructs him gently: 'Tank let's go. Come on, we already went bye bye.' But as the naughty boy sits wagging his tail playfully and ignores her pleas entirely, her tone takes a different turn. Barking mad: Tank the dog drives his owner Crystal Felmy crazy by refusing to get out of the car  in Florida . 'Come on get out. Tank, out of the car. Come on, let's go. Let's go, come on. Tank come on.' He then decides to provoke her even further by jumping back and forth from seat to seat like a kangaroo, making it even harder for Crystal to exert her authority. 'Get out of the car! Oh you're a funny guy,' she  exclaims sarcastically before slamming the door and continuing to shout at him through the open window. 'Come on. Really? Really? You're not funny. It was funny for a minute now it's not. Get out of the car!' MailOnline contacted Crystal - who adopted Tank for $45 when he was one year old - to find out what life is like dealing with such a mischievous pet. 'He understands what I'm saying!' Tank is clever than he looks and shows off his mischievous nature by pouncing from the back seat to the front of the car to stop Crystal from getting him out . 'Tank  does this type of stuff a lot,' she admits. 'I really do think he understands what I'm saying sometimes. 'I'll ask him questions and he will respond by putting his paw on me or giving me kisses, or completely running away and trying to hide when I tell him it's time for a bath.' Ironically, Crystal recalls that on the day she and her 12-year-old son Casey adopted the puppy they spent a good half an hour trying to get him into the car to bring him home. He was too afraid and even hid under the bucket seats. She says: 'Now, it's almost impossible to get him OUT of the car.' However, despite Crystal's daily struggle, she confirms that Tank is 'an amazing dog and the canine love of my life. I can't imagine my life without him, we really lucked out'.

"Endangered: Current estimates suggest a third of the world’s gorillas and chimpanzees have died from Ebola since the 1990s . There is a side to the Ebola crisis that, perhaps understandably, has received little media attention: the threat it poses to our nearest cousins, the great apes of Africa. At this moment in time Ebola is the single greatest threat to the survival of gorillas and chimpanzees. The virus is as deadly for great apes as it is for humans - with mortality rates at approximately 95 per cent for gorillas and 77 per cent for chimpanzees. Current estimates suggest a third of the world’s gorillas and chimpanzees have died from Ebola since the 1990s. As with humans, these deaths tend to come in epidemics. In 1995, an outbreak is reported to have killed more than 90 per cent of the gorillas in Minkébé Park in northern Gabon. In 2002-2003, a single outbreak of ZEBOV - the Zaire strain of Ebola - in the Democratic Republic of Congo, killed an estimated 5,000 Western gorillas. It’s hard to accurately count such elusive creatures but the WWF estimates there are up to 100,000 left in the wild – so a single Ebola outbreak wiped out a considerable chunk of the world’s gorilla population. There are of course additional factors behind the declining numbers of Africa’s great apes: illegal trading in wildlife and bushmeat, war, deforestation and other infectious diseases. The world’s remaining wild apes are increasingly being forced into isolated pockets of forest, which impedes their ability to forage, breed and to hide from hunters. There is also a growing body of evidence linking deforestation and subsequent changes in climate to the spread of Ebola and other infectious diseases. Back in 2003 an article on the decline of great apes, written by a team led by primatologist Peter Walsh, predicted that without aggressive investments in law enforcement, protected area management and Ebola prevention, the next decade will see our closest relatives pushed to the brink of extinction. Sadly, this prediction appears to have come true. Since 2008, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the Eastern Gorilla as 'endangered' and the Western Gorilla as 'critically endangered'. Cornered: The world’s remaining wild apes are being increasingly forced into isolated pockets of forest (illustrated on map), which impedes their ability to forage, breed and to hide from hunters . If we do not act fast, these may prove to be the last decades in which apes can continue to live in their natural habitat. Unfortunately, there appears to be a lack of political will to implement policies which would bring viable solutions into effect. We need both short-term solutions to halting the spread of Ebola and long-term ones to prevent future outbreaks. As a short-term strategy, vaccination could prove enormously useful in tackling the Ebola crisis in apes. Unlike for humans, a vaccine for gorillas and apes has been developed which thus far has been proven both safe and effective. Chimpanzees learn kindness by watching and experiencing the compassion of others, a new study suggests. Compassionate: A study has found that chimps are able to learn kindness from others . Scientists claim it’s the first evidence that both children and chimps share common traits of altruism that are learned from the sociable behaviour of peers. The study seems to offer fresh evidence of the evolutionary roots of kindness in humans and non-human primates. Researchers from the University of St Andrews and Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, demonstrated that contrary to earlier findings, in certain conditions, primates display similar behaviour to humans. Professor Andrew Whiten explained: ‘A regard for the welfare of others is seen as a cardinal human virtue. By contrast, several recent scientific studies have concluded that the same dispositions are lacking in our closest living primate relatives. ‘The results of our research provide the first evidence that both children and chimpanzees share common traits of altruism that are learned as a direct result of experiencing the kindness of others.’ To date though, these trials have not involved 'challenging' the vaccinated chimps with the live virus. Across much of Europe, medical research on great apes is either banned or highly restricted because of their cognitive similarity to humans. The question is whether or not we should make an exception in this case. In the long term, conservation efforts aimed at restoring forest habitat could also help curb the spread of the virus, as larger forested areas would reduce the chances of infected animals coming into contact with one another. In tandem with forest regeneration, greater protection for apes from hunters and strict laws to control bushmeat consumption would also be hugely beneficial, both for apes and for humans.","Virus is  deadly for great apes, with mortality rates approximately 95 per cent for gorillas and 77 per cent for chimpanzees .

"Joe France, pictured with his mother Kelly Jones, had been looking forward to seeing The Theory of Everything due to his love of Stephen Hawking . A 12-year-old boy with cerebral palsy could not see a film about Stephen Hawking because there was no wheelchair access to his local cinema. Science lover Joe France had been eagerly awaiting the release of The Theory Of Everything because he looks up to Stephen Hawking, the world-famous physicist who himself uses a wheelchair. But despite it being National Disabled Access Day last Saturday, the Odeon Cinema in Joe's home town of Harrogate, North Yorkshire told him the film wasn't being shown on the any of the screens he can access. Joe's mother, Kelly Jones, told how her son has always used a wheelchair and is very likely to need one for the rest of his life. She says she was left stunned when she phoned up their local cinema last Saturday to check he'd be able to see the film, but was told it was not possible. The mother-of-five said: 'It was ironic as it was National Disabled Access Day, and we were going to see a film about the most famous disabled person in the world and they had no disabled access. 'Joe was just left confused by the whole thing, he couldn't understand why they couldn't show it for him in another screen. 'He said to me; 'The film was supposed to inspire people but how can can somebody in a wheelchair be inspired if they can't see it?' 'I cried when he said that, it's just such a good way of looking at it. I have always told Joe you can get anything you want in life but you just have to do it a little bit differently to get the goal. 'Look at Stephen Hawking - he was told he only had a couple of years to live and look where he is now. 'He was so disappointed not to see the film. Last night he watched the trailer about six times.' IT recruitment consultant Ms Jones said when she asked staff at her local Odeon if they could move one of the showings to a disabled access screen on Saturday or Sunday, she was told head office decide what films are shown in what screens and there was nothing to be done. But when Ms Jones phoned Odeon cinema in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, she was told the film would not be shown on any of the screens her son could access . Although Ms Jones, 36, couldn't fault the manner she was treated - she said the staff member she spoke to was very polite - she did think the Odeon could have done more to help her and her son. The single mother added: 'Joe has been waiting to see this film since it came out on New Year's Day but I told him we should wait a couple of weeks to make sure we can get in. 'He is really into science, physics and into space. He has got a telescope and wants to be astronomer. Joe is a keen scientist and lists Stephen Hawking among his 'top three heroes' 'He wanted to see the film because of the science but and also because Stephen Hawking wasn't always in a wheelchair, which really interests him.' Schoolboy Joe said: 'I felt a bit disappointed really, I was looking forward to seeing the film, Stephen Hawking is one of my top three heroes. 'I am very interested in time, space, physics and black hole theory. I would like to study sciences at college and maybe be an astronomer, or a geography teacher or a science teacher. 'I thought it was going to be a very special day but I ended up doing nothing. It would be good to see more lifts in buildings to give disabled people access.' Since the incident Odeon have contacted Ms Kelly and offered her free tickets to a showing this Friday, but Ms Kelly said they won't be returning to the cinema. Jason Stanton, Head of Guest Experience at Odeon, said: 'Odeon Harrogate is inside a listed building, so we are unfortunately unable to change its layout to add wheelchair access to the two screens that currently don't have it. 'We therefore try to rotate weekly the films we show in the three screens that do have access for people with disabilities, to ensure a full range of films is available. 'The Theory of Everything was shown in a screen with wheelchair access during the week of January 9 - 15 and we'll be showing it again in a wheelchair-accessible screen for another week from this Friday January 23. 'On the weekend of the January 17-18, newer release films American Sniper, Into the Woods and Taken 3 were shown in the screens with access for people with disabilities, to ensure a variety of films are on offer. He wanted to the see the acclaimed film about the famous scientist staring Eddie Redmayne (pictured) Mr Stanton added: 'Unfortunately, this wasn't communicated to the guest clearly and we apologise for the frustration this caused. 'We have invited them back to see The Theory of Everything as guests of the cinema, and they have assured us they are satisfied with how the matter was concluded. 'We have a proud history of working with the Cinema Exhibitor's Association (CEA) to fundraise for charities that support people with disabilities such as Variety, the children's charity - and to champion equality in cinemas for all. 'Odeon is also proud to be a part of the CEA Card scheme, a national concessionary card to allow people with disabilities to obtain free cinema tickets for people accompanying them. 'The vast majority of our screens are accessible to wheelchair users, and we have been at the forefront of introducing other initiatives for guests with disabilities including providing headsets for visually impaired guests, and hosting Audio Descriptive Screenings and Autism Friendly Screenings.' A spokesperson for Disabled Access Day said: 'This shows that while there has been much progress, there is still a great deal that needs to be done in the area of accessibility and illustrates how important it is to so many people's lives. Often access is about exploring creative solutions and greater understanding.'

"Three female lawyers have reportedly been executed by Islamic State militants as the UN warns that educated women in Iraq are especially at risk. Today, the UN human rights office condemned numerous executions of civilians in the country by ISIS and said the jihadist group is showing a 'monstrous disregard for human life'. ISIS, which controls large swathes of territory in Iraq and in neighbouring war-ravaged Syria, last week published pictures of the crucifixions of two men accused of being bandits, and of a woman being stoned to death, allegedly for adultery. Scroll down for video . Executions: The UN human rights office has condemned numerous executions of civilians in the country by Islamic State . Other women have also reportedly been executed recently in ISIS-controlled areas, including Mosul, UN spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said. 'Educated, professional women, particularly women who have run as candidates in elections for public office, seem to be particularly at risk,' she said. 'In just the first two weeks of this year, reports indicate that three female lawyers were executed.' A number of other groups are also targeted by the jihadists, Shamdasani said, referring to 'the ruthless murder of two men, who were thrown off the top of a building after having been accused of homosexual acts by a so-called court in Mosul'. ISIS released a video showing the two men being thrown off the top of a tower block in Raqqa, Syria, for being gay. A masked Islamic State fighter announced the charges against the accused using a small handheld radio, before declaring them guilty of engaging in homosexual activities. He said they should be punished by death, in accordance with Islamic State's radical interpretation of Sharia law. The men were then bound and blindfolded before being pushed off the 100ft tower block to their deaths.

Down on the ground, two men accused of banditry have been tied to makeshift metal crosses. Strung up tightly with yellow and green ribbon around their wrists, the men were hanged from the crosses, wincing in agony’. And it's believed the ISIS militants killed three of at least 15 pigeon breeders in Iraq after deciding it is against Islamic religion to keep birds this week. The extremists also executed 13 teenage boys for watching the Asian Cup football match between Iraq and Jordan last week. The young football fans had been caught watching the game on television in the Iraqi city of Mosul, which is controlled by the Islamic State. The final images show a burqa-clad woman being read her charges for adultery before she is stoned to death . ISIS now controls large swathes of Syria and Iraq, having taken over a considerable amount since last year . The teenagers were rounded up and publicly executed by a firing squad using machine guns, according to anti-ISIS activist group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently. The small activist group said the teenagers were rounded up by militants in the Al-Yarmouk district of Mosul after 'breaking religious laws' by watching football. Images also emerged of a woman, dressed in a black burqa, being stoned to death by a horde of ISIS militants. But minorities are not the only ones suffering, with the jihadists meting out 'cruel and inhuman punishments' to anyone accused of violating its 'extremist interpretations of Islamic Sharia law, or for suspected disloyalty,' Shamdasani said. Four doctors were recently killed in central Mosul, allegedly after refusing to treat ISIS fighters. The group also reportedly executed 15 civilians in front of a large crowd in Fallujah on January 1, on suspicion they had cooperated with Iraqi security forces, and 14 more in a public square in Dour, north of Tikrit, for refusing to pledge allegiance to ISIS, Shamdasani said.","UN warns educated, professional women are particularly at risk from ISIS .

Barker was caught driving last year while taking his former partner's car from her home at Waterloo to refuel it at an Alexandria service station, the court heard. He had received a phone call from his daughter saying his wife had no money or petrol in her car. The court also heard he had complied with previous orders and had not offended for about six years before he was nabbed in 2012. The crown pushed for Barker to serve the year in jail. 'He hasn't displayed any remorse,' prosecutor James Dorney said. The crown pushed for Barker to serve the year in jail as they believe he hasn't shown any remorse . Nathaniel Barker had been sentenced to 12 months in jail, which has now been downgraded to a four month suspended sentence . Judge Syme agreed, telling the court 'nothing seems to have sunk in'. 'Of concern to me... is that Mr Barker to this day still has very limited insight into the consequences of his driving,' she said. But she said a year in jail was a significant sentence for a traffic offence and even more so for a man of Barker's years. After quashing the original sentence, Judge Syme warned Barker about the conditions attached to his four-month suspended sentence and four-month bond. 'If you drive again during the course of this bond... there will be nothing that will save you from going to jail for the full term of this sentence.' Barker will walk from the court on Tuesday afternoon after completing the necessary paperwork.

"A Brooklyn who sent $67,000 to al-Qaida and pledged his support to the terror group has been sentenced to 15 years in prison. Wesam el-Hanafi, who was born in New York, has admitted to providing technical supplies, including encryption devices and surveillance cameras, along with tens of thousands in cash to terrorist leaders in Yemen. He and an accomplice also cased the New York Stock Exchange for a possible attack from operatives working for al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). Wesam el-Hanafi 'turned his back on his country' when handed over tens of thousands of dollars and technical equipment to al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula . 'He was living the American dream. Then he turned his back on his country and pledged allegiance to our greatest enemies,' Manhattan Assistant US Attorney John Cronan said. 'The defendant was all in with al-Qaeda.' Federal Judge Kimba Wood in Manhattan sentenced Brooklyn-born Wesam El-Hanafi  on Tuesday. The sentence was less than the 20-year maximum term prosecutors had sought, and three years less than his co-defendant received. He received leniency because he suffers from deep-vein thrombosis, a condition that creates blood clots in his legs that can be painful and even cause death. El-Hanafi pleaded guilty in June 2012, two years after he was brought to the United States from Dubai. Prosecutors say El-Hanafi pledged loyalty to al-Qaida and sought to teach the group how to evade detection on the Internet. He went to Yemen in 2008 and met with al-Qaida representatives. El-Hanafi said he regrets his actions and is embarrassed.","Wesam el-HanafI got less than the 20 years that prosecutors asked for because he suffers from deep vein thrombosis .

"A mother-of-11 who claims £38,000 a year in benefits  has announced she is pregnant with her twelfth child - a baby girl. Cheryl Prudham, 32, from Gravesend, Kent, who claims the benefits through child allowances, tax credits and housing benefit with her husband Robert, 30, announced the latest news of her pregnancy on Facebook. The Prudham's earn more than the Government's £26,000-a-year benefits cap because working as carers for 20 hours a week each allows them to claim tax credits. Cheryl and Robert Prudham pictured with some of their 11 children - they are now expecting number 12 . She told her friends and family: 'I'm having a GIRL!!' which was greeted with congratulations. She said her eighth girl will have a double-barrelled name, saying: 'I want a double barrel name, first name needs to begin with L like my Lexi-Rose, Lacey-May and Lainey-girl.' She later said that due to the amount of children she already has, she has 'run out of ideas' for names. Just hours after posting the news, she shared a scan of the baby with the caption 'my princess'. Mrs Prudham, 32, a mother of 11 posted a picture of a scan with the caption 'Prudham baby #12' on Facebook . Mrs Prudham, who had her first son when she was 17, says she is proud of having 11 children . Finally, she decided against the child's name beginning with 'L' and revealed she will call the baby 'Tillie-Grace'. Mrs Prudham, who had twins in August, hit the headlines at the beginning of the year after posting a scan of her 12th child, before quickly saying it was a joke - but it wasn't. She has previously claimed it is 'easy' to claim tens of thousands of pounds in benefits. Mrs Prudham, who had her first son when she was 17 and living in a homeless hostel, says she is proud of having 11 children. She has insisted she is not a 'lazy layabout' and says her husband also works. She told Closer magazine: 'It's the Government's fault I've got so many kids. It's easy to claim benefits. 'I've always wanted a big family and being a mum is the best feeling in the world. We didn't rush into the decision to have more children lightly but we knew we'd be able to afford it.' Mrs Prudham found out she was pregnant in October, just weeks after she had her twin daughters. The couple had twins in August and are now expecting another baby girl in the near future . The couple, who live in a five-bedroom semi-detached council home both work 20 hours a week as carers for the elderly. Mrs Prudham had her first son George, 13, when she was just 17 and was living in a homeless hostel in Kent in the summer of 2000. She soon moved into a flat with her ex-boyfriend and had second son, Jack, 12, and her eldest daughter Caitlin, eight. She then had three unplanned pregnancies; Maisie, seven, Lillie, five, and Madison, four. In March 2009, she met current husband Rob and they had Leon, now three. They then had Lenny, now two, before she gave birth to daughter Lainey in January last year. She then had twins Lacey-May and Lexi-Rose this autumn. The mother-of-11 first attracted criticism after demanding her local council provide her with a bigger council house to give her growing family more space. And as their family grew Mrs Prudham said publicly their benefits allowed to them to set aside thousands for foreign holidays and presents for their children.

"Tobias Bowen who is accused of child rape in the U.S., has been allowed to stay in Britain because his human rights could be breached if he is extradited . A fugitive foreign doctor accused of child rape in the U.S. has been allowed to stay in Britain - in case the Americans lock him up for too long. Judges ruled it would be a breach of Tobias Bowen's human rights if they agreed to his extradition. The 48-year-old fled New York for Africa four years ago while on $10,000 bail charged with two counts of raping a child. Detectives working with the U.S. Marshals Fugitive Task Force tracked his travels, which included a stay in Holland, and he was taken into custody at Heathrow when he visited Britain in April last year. Westminster Magistrates' Court yesterday heard that he had since settled in Milton Keynes with his wife and young family – making Britain his 'safe haven'. Daniel Sternberg, acting on behalf of the American authorities, told the court: 'Bowen is undoubtedly a fugitive from justice from the legal powers of the United States. 'He was granted bail for a huge amount of $10,000 and subsequently left the country in 2010. 'He was given bail and released and his record is not good, he has not attended court and travelled in Liberia and the Netherlands.' But, in a judgment likely to spark outrage in America, magistrates ruled that Bowen's 'right to liberty and security' under the European Convention on Human Rights was at threat from his extradition. District judge Margaret Rose rejected claims that putting him on a plane would breach either his right to a fair trial or his freedom of expression. But she added: 'However, his Article 5 right to liberty and security would be at risk if he were to go back and convicted in New York state and face indefinite imprisonment, therefore he is discharged. His defence lawyer, Malcolm Hawkes, said the reference to article 5 meant there was a fear his client would be placed in indefinite detention if he went back to the US. The U.S. is expected to lodge an immediate appeal and Bowen was remanded in custody. If he is bailed at a future date, the surety is expected to be £10,000. Bail conditions would include no access to his passport, no international travel and a 12 hour electronic curfew plus daily reports to a police station. Judges ruled it would be a breach of Tobias Bowen's human rights if they agreed to his extradition. Bowen, 48, fled New York for Africa four years ago while on $10,000 bail charged with two counts of raping a child . Westminster magistrates court yesterday heard that Bowen (pictured) has since settled in Milton Keynes with his wife and young family – making Britain his 'safe haven'. The doctor was charged in the U.S. in March 2010 . Bowen, a doctor who ran a public hospital in his native Liberia, was charged with rape and criminal sex acts in New York in March 2010. Mr Hawkes said his client was of 'good character' and argued he should be allowed to return to his family. He had 'lived openly' in Liberia but had now surrendered his Dutch and Liberian passports. He added: 'The time has come to give my client the benefit of the doubt. It would be regrettable if the appeal against today's decision were to take some time and he were to spend a year in jail. 'His proper place is with his family and the UK is his safe haven.' There has been controversy over a string of cases in which British citizens were extradited to the U.S.. They included Paul Dunham, 59, and Sandra Dunham, 58, who took a drug overdose the night before they were due to hand themselves in to U.S. marshals. The couple admitted fraud last year after being eventually put on a plane. Golf club president Christopher Tappin, 66, also lost his fight against extradition on charge of aiding and abetting the illegal export of defence articles. He later admitted the offence under a so-called plea bargain.

"Brrrrr! We are bang in the middle of winter and, sadly, the tan from my recent holiday to Mexico is fading fast. Looking on the bright side, this gives me a rare chance to experiment with a pale and interesting make-up look. So this week I’m trying out modern Gothic glamour – a gorgeous look that’s all dark smoky eyes, deep mulberry lips and flawless foundation. Binky Felstead tries out the glam Gothic look, with smoky eyes and a perfectly applied deep plum pout . GET THE LOOK . Alluring Eyes . Naturally you’ll begin with your base. Go for the full works, applying foundation, concealer and powder to achieve the beautifully pale, creamy complexion that the Gothic look requires. After smoothing primer across your lids (try bareMinerals PrimeTime Brightening Eye Primer), take an inky shade and smooth it over your lids. I used Too Faced Bulletproof Eyeliner Pencil in Black Out, which has a soft, smudgeable formula and boasts a handy blending sponge at the tip. Don’t fret about it looking too perfect as next you’re going to blend more colour on top – I used a dark-chocolate shade called Panther from the Too Faced Cat Eyes Eyeshadow Palette, smudging it over the eye pencil to create really dark, sultry lids. Multiple layers of black mascara will give you really long, thick, sooty lashes. I used Guerlain Maxi Lash Mascara, wiggling the wand right into the roots and along to the tips of my lashes to make sure each one was covered with colour. Finally, it’s easy to scatter eyeshadow on to your cheeks when doing smoky eyes, so I smudge on a touch of Clarins Instant Concealer to tidy up any spills and conceal dark circles at the same time. Binky uses contouring tricks to give her cheekbones subtle definition while still looking pale and interesting . Beautiful Bone Structure . Yes, I’ve managed to sneak a little bronzer into this look but the object here is to add definition not colour. Blend Daniel Sandler Instant Tan Face Powder below your cheekbones and under your jawline to contour your face and sharpen up your bone structure. Blend in the velvety powder using a big fluffy brush, and you’ll have supermodel-style cheekbones in no time! Luscious Lips . To create my Gothic pout I used a clever make-up artist’s trick. Begin by filling in your whole lip area with dark eyeliner pencil – I used Daniel Sandler Long Lasting Waterproof Eyeliner in Black Velvet. Don't be alarmed by your matte-black lips as the effect will be softened when you smudge a glossy, berry coloured lip stain over the top – try Too Faced Melted Liquified Long Wear Lipstick in Ruby. The result is a luscious, wine-coloured pout that looks as dramatic as it does divine. You can get all the products I used to create this look from Escentual.com. The Made In Chelsea star  rocks a romantic-cum-Gothic make-up that looks 'as dramatic as it does divine' If you’re wary of sporting a deep, dark lip but still want to experiment with the modern Gothic look, a sheerer lipstick such as Lord & Berry Twistick in Rock & Rose will give the look a softer finish. This is a stunning evening beauty look, and luckily the long winter nights offer up plenty of opportunities to give it a go. What I really love about ultra-glam make-up like this is that it calls for a similarly breathtaking outfit – a sultry dress, perhaps, and some spectacular statement jewellery. I mean, which girl doesn’t relish the chance to slip into a red-carpet gown and serious diamonds!? Here, I’m wearing a £200,000 white-gold necklace decorated with 30 carats of diamonds, and a gorgeous £50,000, 15-carat ballroom bracelet from jeweller Vashi Dominguez. Binky sparkles in a white gold diamond necklace and £50,000 ballroom bracelet that she says compliments this week's equally dramatic beauty look perfectly . Binky pairs her glamorous evening make-up with this £200,000 two-strand diamond necklace . Sadly these pieces were only mine for the duration of the photo shoot, and there was a security guard on hand to make sure I gave them back. But just draping on these gems was thrilling, nonetheless. The good news? Head to Vashi.com and you’ll find there’s plenty to lust after in the jeweller’s more affordable range – glittering designs which boast the same fine quality but at more achievable prices. So excuse me while I shop for some new sparklers. Well, you know what they say: diamonds are a girl’s best friend! Stay glam.

"It would be impossible to eliminate all instances of sexual assault and violence on college campuses, but some female students believe they have found a way to greatly curb these incidents. Women across the country are making a push to have sororities play host to drinking parties on campus, allowing their fellow women to have more control over the events of the evening. There is however one major problem with this idea - sororities have banned the consumption of alcohol in their houses for decades. Michelle Deloison-Baum, left, and Yujin Nam speak in the doorway of the Sigma Delta house, a sorority with no national affiliation that holds parties with alcohol, at Dartmouth College . The New York Times points out that many sexual assaults on college campuses occur at fraternity house parties, and this new system 'would give women - not just sorority members - the option to attend Greek parties that women control, from setting off-limits areas to the content of the punch.' Helping their cause are a variety of recent studies, including one in 2007 funded by the Department of Justice that reported women who frequently attend fraternity parties are more likely to be victims of sexual assault and another that found fraternity members are more likely to have committed rape than those men who are not a part of the Greek system. 'I’ve been to parties run by girls, and they’re much more protective - they keep an eye on each other,' said George Washington junior Amber McLeod. 'At frat parties, it’s more of a hunting ground. Not all guys are like this, of course, but sometimes it feels like the lions standing in the background and looking at the deer. And then they go in for the kill.' What's more, as Martha McKinnon, a junior at University of Michigan and member of Delta Gamma, points out, the system makes Greek women rely on fraternities for all social events that involve drinking. 'It pushes us into the fraternities. The whole social scene is embedded in the fraternity house and makes us dependent on them,' she explains. 'I find this a dangerous scenario.' Fraternity houses on the George Washington University campus in Washington . Other Greek females aren't sold on the idea however, acknowledging that while sexual assault is a big problem on campus, alcohol is a greater threat to women than fraternities. 'I don’t think saying there should be more alcohol is the solution to sexual assault,' argues Kappa Kappa Gamma Sarah Grossman, who is in her junior year at Drake University. 'As women, have friends around you, and don’t drink too much. Be safe. Be surrounded by people you know and care about you.' Kathryn Miller, a member of Delta Gamma at the University of Southern Mississippi, echoes Grossman's thoughts, pointing out; 'When people are under the influence, they’re going to do what they want to do. It can happen anywhere, even in a sorority.' This all comes at a time when sexual assault on college campuses has become a frequent topic in the media, with recent high profile cases involving fraternities at Brown University, Texas Tech, Georgia Tech and the University of Virginia, to name just a few, becoming national news. As for reversing the ban on alcohol in sorority houses, that may be slightly easier than some might suggest as, despite popular opinion, the ban came to be by way of a voluntary policy of all 26 houses in the National Panhellenic Conference, and not the often perpetuated myth that local laws declare any home that houses more than four women and serves alcohol a brothel. Sororities that are not part of NPC do not have to abide by this ban however, such as Sigma Delta at Dartmouth College, which does host parties with alcohol. And while female support for this change in policy may be strong, men in the Greek system seem less sold. A fraternity member at George Washington, who declined to be identified, commented;  'It’s just the way it is. We buy the alcohol, we serve the alcohol, they drink it. We all have a good time.'","There has been growing support among women at college campuses across the country to have sororities host drinking parties .
Many believe that this will curb cases of sexual assault by creating a safer zone for women and making them less dependent on fraternities for events .
This despite a decades long ban that prohibits national sororities from serving alcohol in their houses .
Others believe this just creates bigger problems by introducing more alcohol to the Greek system ."
"For one obese woman, trying to shed the pounds came with one major hurdle - she hated fruit and vegetables so much she hadn't touched a piece of green veg since she was four and not a morsel of fruit had passed her lips since the age of 10. But at 21st 2lb 38-year-old Wendy from Manchester, was so scared her weight was going to kill her she decided to bite the broccoli and face her fruit and vegetable phobia. After seven weeks of a calorie controlled diet, the mother-of-three, who appeared on Channel 4's weight loss documentary, Weighing Up The Enemy, last night managed to drop 11lb, 7.2 per cent of her body fat. Scroll down for video . At  21st 2lb, Wendy, 38, from Manchester, was so scared her weight was going to kill her she decided to break the habit of a lifetime and try fruit and veg . Wendy's family motivated her: 'I thought I was going to die - that my children wouldn’t get to see me' The former nursery manager, was made redundant seven years ago and lives off council benefits. 'We currently receive housing benefit, council tax benefit and my husband receives a disability living allowance. It’s not an option for us to me back to work. We would be worse off than we are now,' she said. It was after losing her job that Wendy piled on the pounds, putting on 6st in as many years. 'I ate loads out of boredom more than anything. If I was feeling a bit low  I just wanted my food,' she admitted on the Channel 4 programme presented by Dr Christian Jessen. She also admitted that there one friend who was always there for her - KFC. ‘Fried chicken was my favourite. It's  like a thousand little kisses. 'As you put them into your mouth it’s like they’re kissing you and your tongue’s saying thank you.' 'I ate loads out of boredom more than anything,' said Wendy. 'If I was feeling a bit low I just wanted my food' Despite romanticising about her favourite junk food, Wendy realised that her penchant for fried, unhealthy meals was leading her down a dangerous path. ‘I knew if I didn’t change my lifestyle I was going to be dead soon – my body was going to give up. 'I thought I was going to die - that my children wouldn’t get to see me. 'I'd done the Atkins Diet, Slimming World, Weight Watchers and I'd even tried a Chinese tea diet,' she says, but none of them had worked. At 21st 2lb Wendy was carrying an extra 11st and at 52 per cent, her body fat was double what it should have been. In order to shift the pounds welfare reliant Wendy took on the challenge to stick to a calorie controlled diet, consuming a maximum of 1,200 calories a day. But without fruit and vegetables to eat, keeping down the calories was no simple feat. 'I didn’t eat fruit and I didn’t eat vegetables. Perhaps if I did, I wouldn’t have been that size,' she said. 'Last time I'd had an apple I must have been about ten or 12. I didn’t have anything that was remotely healthy to be fair. 'Green was poison!' After seven weeks Wendy lost 11lb, 7.2 per cent of her body fat and is continuing on her diet . But spurred on by her husband Ian, Wendy decided to give the green stuff a go. Apart from the lack of healthy foods, she also had trouble cutting out the takeaway and snacks. 'I tried not to cut everything out I enjoyed eating so that when I had a craving I could go upstairs into my drawer, which has given me loads of pleasure in the past, and have something I enjoyed eating as a treat. Exercise also proved a challenge - even a short walk around the block was a huge challenge. 'I have tried it in the past and it’s been too painful to get round the whole thing. On her first attempt, Wendy hoped to burn  500 calories, the equivalent of two Mars Bars, but was disappointed to learn she had only worked off 95 calories. But spurred on by the idea that she may not see her children grow up, Wendy stuck to a calorie controlled diet and upped her exercise - hitting the gym three times a week. 'Before all of this my confidence was at rock bottom,' she says. After seven weeks Wendy lost 11lb, 7.2 per cent of her body fat. ‘The weight loss has been great for me. It's such a massive goal I’ve wanted to start for such a long time,' she says. 'This is the diet I’ve taken most seriously and will continue until I’m at an ideal weight.'

"A mother is behind bars after admitting to injecting a substance into her son's IV drip as he lay in the hospital. Candy Fluty of Kermit, West Virginia appeared in court on Monday after she injected the substance over the weekend while her son Elijah was being treated for symptoms related to Hirschsprung disease, which causes a blockage of the large intestine due to improper muscle movement in the bowel. According to Fluty's aunt Katie, the substance was allegedly saline. Scroll down for video . Behind bars: Candy Fluty (left) was arrested after admitting she injected a substance into her son Elijah's (right) IV drip while he was in the hospital . Chronic illness: Elijah (above with his mother) was being treated for symptoms related to Hirschsprung disease, which causes a blockage of the large intestine due to improper muscle movement in the bowel . WSAZ reports that 'the criminal complaint charges were filed based on Fluty's own statements and video evidence.' Friends and family members have been quick to hop to Fluty's defense in the aftermath of this incident, saying the single mother of four children would never do anything to hurt one of her kids, especially 9-year-old Elijah, who has spent a large portion of his life in hospitals. Her aunt explained that Fluty was in the room with Elijah when a blood clot began to form, and as she was waiting for the nurse she pushed the saline into the boy's system. A saline solution under high pressure can be pushed directly at a blood clot to break it up. There have however also been cases of saline being used to poison, and ultimately kill, patients. Difficult week: A family member says that the substance injected was allegedly saline, and that is was done to help Elijah (above) who was having a bad blood clot . Fluty wrote of Elijah's experience at Cincinnati Children's Hospital on Facebook prior to this weekend's incident, offering a glimpse into the intense surgeries the boy has been enduring his entire life. On Friday she wrote; 'Elijah unfortunately has a fever and feels pretty yucky. He had 9 teeth removed today and had a tube changed. He is getting morphine and it's keeping him pretty comfortable. Hopefully the fever is just a side effect of anesthesia.' According to her posts, the boy was also having spots on his head cultured to determine what they were and blood clots in his arms examined. Fluty also revealed on Facebook that friends and members of her community had raised money to help her and her family as they dealt with Elijah's medical costs, raising enough money for the 35-year-old to make a down payment on a car so her son could get to and from the hospital. 'I heard that some people were questioning as to what the money will be used for and I just wanted everyone to know I really appreciate everything anyone has done for us no matter what it has been,' wrote Fluty. She is currently being held on $50,000 bail and has been ordered to stay away from her son. Her defense attorney claims the entire situation is a 'total misunderstanding.'","Candy Fluty of Kermit, West Virginia was arrested Monday after admitting to injecting a substance into her son Elijah's IV drip .

"A landlord claims more than $12,000 of damage has been caused to his California mountain cabin after two separate sets of Airbnb guests went on alcohol and drug-fueled rampages over the holidays last month. David Cook has since posted photographs of the destruction on Facebook. He said he hopes his story will serve as a cautionary tale to other would-be Airbnb renters. David Cook claims the damage was caused to his California mountain cabin after two separate pairs of Airbnb guests went on alcohol and drug-fueled rampages over the holidays last month . The damage caused to Cook's property near Lake Arrowhead in southern California included doors being taken off their hinges . Both times, Cook told Business Insider that the couples stayed for two nights and allegedly trashed his property near Lake Arrowhead in southern California. Cook said the first couple got ‘liquored and drugged up’ so bad that they begin fighting and then trashed the cabin. He estimates that they caused $2,000 of damage after ripping a ceramic soap dish out of the shower, snapping the bedpost off of a solid mahogany bed - a 100-year-old family heirloom - and braking a banister. The second group stayed over New Year’s Eve and Cook has accused them of causing even more damage. Once again Cook says the couple - a boyfriend and his fiancé - had a fight. ‘We think this guy was on meth or something,’ he told Business Insider. Cook has accused the man of destroying two nightstands - described as antique family heirlooms. The man then took a leg from one of the nightstands and proceeded to bash holes in walls and windows.

David Cook has since posted photographs of the destruction on Facebook and said he hopes his story will serve as a cautionary tale to other would-be Airbnb renters . A closet door was ripped off its hinges, curtains were destroyed and smashed bottles of alcohol were left over the floor and patio. Cook estimates the damage caused by the second couple at over $10,000. Fortunately for Cook, Airbnb has agreed to cover the costs of the damage incurred. The company operates an insurance scheme for its users called Host Guarantee, which states that it covers hosts for property damage up to a $1 million. 'Over 26 million guests have stayed on Airbnb and problems for hosts and guests are extremely rare. Our Trust and Safety team is investigating this matter and is in contact with this host to help reimburse him under our Host Guarantee program,' said the organization. Cook believes that his bad experience should act as a warning for other Airbnb hosts. 'The story is for hosts like us to make sure they raise the security deposit and reword their postings to let guests know that this will not be tolerated and for hosts to know that this stuff happens more often than Airbnb wants the public to know. 'They don't want the public to know that hosts' properties are being trashed.' One guest proceeded to leave holes in the walls after swinging a leg from a nightstand around .

"In addition to providing light, some curiously designed lamp posts on a bridge in China may actually prompt some people to light up - because the poles look just like massive cigarettes. Painted white at the top and yellow at their base, the posts form part of 'cigarette bridge' on the Qili River in Zhengzhou, Henan Province. After pictures of the bridge began to circulate on the Chinese micro-blogging site Sina Weibo, some users started to speculate that the designer was a heavy smoker. Scroll down for video . White at the top, yellow at the base, these lamp posts on a bridge in China look suspiciously like giant cigarettes . The posts form part of 'cigarette bridge' on the Qili River in Zhengzhou, Henan Province . It's possible that the designer of the poles was attempting to honour local industry. As well as producing cement, tractors, refrigerators and chemical fibre, Henan Province also manufactured more than a billion cigarettes in 2005, according to China.org. The cigarette-shaped street lights are just one example of Chinese architecture gone wrong, or at the very least, gone weird. There are so many strange buildings in China that President Xi Jinping called for an end to 'weird architecture' during a  speech at a literary symposium in Beijing in October. He added that new construction should 'be like sunshine from the blue sky and the breeze in spring that will inspire minds, warm hearts, cultivate taste and clean up undesirable work styles'. It's possible that the designer of the poles was attempting to honour local industry. Henan Province manufactured more than a billion cigarettes in 2005 . President Xi Jinping called for an end to 'weird architecture' during a speech  in Beijing in October . A survey by an architectural firm found that many people ranked the Pangu Plaza Hotel in Beijing as one of the ugliest buildings in China. The building was used during the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Beijing's vice mayor Chen Gang announced in December that the historical city will begin to start regulating building aesthetics. New construction in the city will have to match urban design standards specifying size, style, colour and materials.

"GP Thomas O'Brien told an un-named patient that she should stop taking medication as God was her surgeon according to a Fitness to Practice hearing . A Christian GP performed an exorcism on a seriously ill patient after promising he could 'heal' her without medication, a medical tribunal heard. Dr Thomas O'Brien, 56, persuaded the mother-of-one to undergo the spiritual procedure at his local Pentecostal church after telling her: 'God is your surgeon,' it was claimed. During a four month period leading to the ceremony, Dr O'Brien subjected the patient who was in great pain after stomach surgery to 'religious grooming' in which he said the 'devil was having a real go at her' and that she had 'devil items' in her house, it was alleged. The doctor further exploited her vulnerability by quoting the Bible at her, taking her to religious meetings, praying with her at home and even programming her television remote to satellite TV's The Gospel Channel, it was said. Dr O'Brien and his wife Tina, 62, also gave the woman a copy of a book he had written with his wife called the Occult Checklist and got her to meet the local pastor over lunch at a restaurant. The couple later pressurised the woman into a signing a document called the Prayer of Repentance, the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service was told. The patient who was also severely depressed became convinced she had been possessed by demons and all her troubles were because of the devil. She was told to stop taking anti depressants and blood pressure medication and allegedly warned not to tell her psychiatrist as Dr O'Brien claimed they were 'very dangerous.' She later told her psychiatrist who subsequently reported him to the General Medical Council. At a fitness to practise hearing in Manchester Dr O'Brien, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, faced misconduct charges which include using his professional position to influence the patient's religious beliefs. It is also claimed his actions caused 'distress' to the woman and was 'detrimental' to her health. The woman - known as Patient A - had been prescribed anti depressants, anti hypertensive and analgesic medication and was said to be suicidal and in great pain after colostomy surgery. She met the GP in August 2012 when he was a locum at Apsley Surgery in the Corbridge Health Centre in Stoke. Peter Atherton, counsel for the GMC, said: 'She first consulted Dr O'Brien by telephone when she was in great pain, depressed and suicidal. In the course of that telephone consultation Dr O'Brien asked her if she had a faith and she said she didn't he told her his wife knew of a different way that could heal her that did not involve medication. Dr O'Brien was working as a locum GP at the Aspley Surgery at the Corbridge Health Centre, pictured . 'Later that same day Dr O'Brien telephoned Patient A and his wife Tina spoke to her. The following day Dr O'Brien went to her home and started to talk to her about God. 'On that occasion he also programmed the television to the Gospel Channel. 'Dr O'Brien and his wife also invited Patient A for lunch with them and their friends at a local restaurant. 'One of the friends present was a pastor at the church. Dr O'Brien and his wife befriended and attempted to evangelise Patient A. They often prayed with her and took her to meetings where she took part in religious practices.' Mr Atherton said that Patient A - and other members of her family - were also given numerous religious gifts, including the Occult Checklist and was offered the use of a log cabin. 'It was compiled and written by Tom and Tina O'Brien,' he said. 'Together with that document they included a document called Prayer of Repentance, which they pressurised her, particularly the doctor's wife, to sign. 'She has said the doctor advised her that for religious reasons she should stop taking her medication and not go to see the psychiatrist. When he saw him he advised her that there is a better way. He is linked to the Pentecostal church. 'He and his wife took her to a meeting and at that meeting she was advised against seeing a psychiatrist, that god was her surgeon and she should stop her medication. They also offered her an exorcism and performed it. She was made to feel as if all things going wrong were due to the devil.' 'From documents provided by Dr O'Brien it appears he and his wife's relationship with Patient A was based solely on Christian principles whereas Patient A believes the gifts and acts of kindness amounted to a form of religious grooming designed to cause division within her family - particularly herself and her partner, and caused her great distress.' The woman rang Dr O'Brien at the surgery in Stoke, pictured, and he asked whether she had any faith . She later told her psychiatrist of the doctor's conduct, who in turn wrote a letter to the General Medical Council and an investigation commenced. When Dr O'Brien, who qualified as a doctor from the National University of Ireland in 1982, heard about the allegations, he filed a complaint to the GMC about the psychiatrist's conduct in reporting the matter but the case was quickly dismissed. An initial report claimed the patient was subjected to a four-hour 'testimony' in January 2013 where an exorcism was performed and she claimed Dr O'Brien specifically told her not to tell her psychiatrist about the meetings - because they 'do the devil's work'. The GP is said to have further told her that if she told the GMC 'she would be cursed'. The patient ignored this advice and complained to both - after she broke down about her treatment and first told her psychiatrist who then rang a confidential helpline to report her allegations. Dr O'Brien later denied all of the accusations, calling them 'attacks' on his 'private Christian faith and life' and insisting he was a lay bible teacher . He accepts visiting Patient A's home shortly after their first consultation, but refutes the allegations against him over the alleged exorcism. He did not attend the hearing but in a letter said that he has already resigned from medicine. He said: 'I know what went on and what my wife and I did or did not do. Even if they [GMC] did side with me, I know true justice will be done one day and no-one can escape from that. 'The allegations have been severe enough to break anyone down emotionally and I'm grateful for my faith which sustained me throughout the ordeal. 'I forgive the patient and her husband and also the psychiatrist for the horrendous allegations against my wife and me. We are enjoying living a quiet private life and we are able to help many more people than I would have done by staying in the NHS. God knows everything and will judge fairly.' The case continues.","Dr Thomas O'Brien told the female patient God was her surgeon .

New Jersey born filmmaker Steve Feldman, who learned Japanese at college, travelled to Japan to take a ride inside their world. He said adding garish lights to already flashy sports cars is something unique to Japan. 'The Japanese are very group oriented and these guys cruise together, eat together and spend a lot of time together. Probably more time together than with their own families,' he said. 'They are not afraid to stand out and they don't care what people say to them. They don't think they are ruining supercars by doing what they do. 'All of this is very different to US car culture.

"In Silicon Valley, it's never too early to become an entrepreneur. Just ask 13-year-old Shubham Banerjee. The California eighth-grader has launched a company to develop low-cost machines to print Braille, the tactile writing system for the visually impaired. Tech giant Intel Corp. recently invested in his startup, Braigo Labs. Shubham came up with his product as a school science fair project last year after he asked his parents a simple question: How do blind people read? 'Google it,' they told him. Scroll down for video . Starting young: Shubham Banerjee, right, works on his Lego robotics braille printer as his dad Neil watches at home in Santa Clara, California . Shubham then did some online research and was shocked to learn that Braille printers, also called embossers, cost at least $2,000 - too expensive for most blind readers, especially in developing countries. 'I just thought that price should not be there. I know that there is a simpler way to do this,' said Shubham, who demonstrated how his printer works at the kitchen table where he spent many late nights building it with a Lego Mindstorms EV3 kit. Shubham wants to develop a desktop Braille printer that costs around $350 and weighs just a few pounds, compared with current models that can weigh more than 20 pounds. The machine could be used to print Braille reading materials on paper, using raised dots instead of ink, from a personal computer or electronic device. 'My end goal would probably be having most of the blind people . . . using my Braille printer,' said Shubham, who lives in the Silicon Valley suburb of Santa Clara, just minutes away from Intel's headquarters. On a roll: Last month, tech giant Intel Corp. invested in his startup, Braigo Labs, making the 8th grader the youngest entrepreneur to receive venture capital funding . Team effort: Banerjee is using the money to hire professional engineers and advisers to help design and build his invention . Braigo - a name that combines Braille and Lego - has now won numerous awards and enthusiastic support from the blind community. Banerjee started Braigo Labs last summer with an initial $35,000 investment from his dad. 'We as parents started to get involved more, thinking that he's on to something and this innovation process has to continue,' said his father, Niloy Banerjee, an engineer who works for Intel. Shubham used the money to build a more sophisticated version of his Lego-based printer using an off-the-shelf desktop printer and a newly released Intel computer chip. The new model, Braigo 2.0, can translate electronic text into Braille before printing. Intel executives were so impressed with Shubham's printer that in November they invested an undisclosed sum in his start-up. Intel officials believe he's the youngest entrepreneur to receive venture capital, money invested in exchange for a financial stake in the company. 'He's solving a real problem, and he wants to go off and disrupt an existing industry. And that's really what it's all about,' said Edward Ross, director of Inventor Platforms at Intel. Braigo Labs is using the money to hire professional engineers and advisers to help design and build Braille printers based on Shubham's ideas. Problem solving: Shubham wants to develop a desktop Braille printer that costs around $350 and weighs just a few pounds, compared with current models that can weigh more than 20 pounds . Next steps: An affordable printer would allow the visually impaired readers to print out letters, household labels, shopping lists and short reading materials on paper in Braille . The company aims to have a prototype ready for blind organizations to test this summer and have a Braigo printer on the market later this year, Niloy Banerjee said. 'This Braille printer is a great way for people around the world who really don't have many resources at all to learn Braille and to use it practically,' said Henry Wedler, who is blind and working on a doctorate in chemistry at the University of California, Davis. Wedler has become an adviser to Braigo Labs. An affordable printer would allow the visually impaired readers to print out letters, household labels, shopping lists and short reading materials on paper in Braille, said Lisamaria Martinez, community services director at the San Francisco Lighthouse for the Blind, a nonprofit center that serves the visually impaired and prints Braille materials for public agencies. 'I love the fact that a young person is thinking about a community that is often not thought about,' said Martinez, who is visually impaired. Shubham is too young to be CEO of his own company, so his mother has taken the job. 'I'm really proud of Shubham. What he has thought, I think most adults should have thought about it,' Malini Banerjee said. 'And coming out of my 13-year-old, I do feel very proud.'","Shubham Banerjee was 12 when he closed funding with Intel .

"In Hollywood circles, Botox used to be referred to as 'liquid gold'. But more and more celebrities are seemingly shunning injections and fillers to return to a somewhat au natural look. Experts agree that the tide seems to be turning against surgical attempts to turn back time, with recent photos of A-listers such as Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox and Dannii Minogue looking more their age. Scroll down for video . Shunning the needle? Courteney Cox sparked concern that she had taken her admitted use of Botox too far in 2013 (left) but is looking much more natural of late (pictured in November 2014, right) Jennifer Aniston is one of many A-listers who are looking much more natural in the face of late (left, in November 2014, right, at the Golden Globes last week) The trend, spotted by Closer, has seen numerous stars looking less pinched and plastic, though still undeniably amazing for their age. Although Jennifer and Gwyneth Paltrow have admitted to only using Botox once, they are among a string of Hollywood's leading ladies whose appearance has caused them to be dogged by surgery rumours. Mother-of-two Gwyneth, 42, has openly spoken about her dabble with Botox, saying it made her look like late comedian Joan Rivers. Speaking to US Harper's Bazaar, the actress said she would be 'scared to go under the knife', although she admitted that may change as she gets older. 'I'll try anything. Except I won't do Botox again, because I looked crazy,' she said. 'I looked like Joan Rivers!' Cougar Town star and former Friends star Courteney Cox sparked concern that she had taken her admitted use of Botox too far in 2013, when she was pictured looking very puffy in the face. The 50-year-old actress looked almost unrecognisable from her former days as lovable obsessive Monica Geller. Gwyneth's face looks far less 'pulled back' with a few natural lines on her face (left in 2012, and right 2014) However, like her former co-star Jennifer, the mother-of-one has been looking more natural of late. As well as her lips seemingly looking thinner, her cheeks look less puffy and there are some fine lines visible around her eyes. Similarly Kylie Minogue has been seen out and about with some natural lines and wrinkles, particularly around her eyes. While still looking unbelievably youthful for her 46 years the Australian singer has lost her former 'plastic look'. She admitted recently that she would no longer consider Botox, saying: 'I wont't go near it. I have lines, you can see them on my face.' Kim Cattrall was one of the first stars to shy away from the trend for surgical help. The 58-year-old Sex And The City actress has spoken about her desire to age gracefully. Kylie Minogue has been seen out and about with some natural lines and wrinkles, particularly around her eyes (left in 2010, right in December 2014) Kim Cattrall, 58, left in 2010 and right in 2014, used Botox in the past but says she wants to age gracefully . She has previously admitted to using Botox on her forehead, but is too frightened to have surgery, saying in 2008: 'I don't want to look in the mirror and not recognise who's looking back.' And it seems this A-list trend is trickling down to average women. Anne-Marie Gillett, Non-Surgical Director at Transform Cosmetic Surgery, said: 'We have seen a significant rise in enquiries for non-surgical procedures to create a more natural finish whilst embracing the ageing process. 'These include chemical facial peels, Microdermabrasion and IPL Skin Rejuvenation. 'We have also found that those requesting Botox are more frequently asking for a more natural look to beat the ageing process – using less product and leaving more time between their treatments. 'We are seeing more women requesting to have some movement in their face rather than the frozen look. 'It's certainly becoming increasingly popular to seek a more sophisticated kind of beauty, rather than the taut and overdone look.' John Ryan, Chairman at MYA cosmetic surgery, said: 'More and more of our patients, like celebrities, are keen to make sure their Botox and fillers look natural. 'Of course, it’s standard practice for us to make those recommendations. Why is it on the rise? 'I think people have seen so many cases of bad jobs on either celebrities or acquaintances that it’s made them realise the effects too much Botox can have. It can make people look older.'","Increasing number of stars showing wrinkles on the red carpet .

"A top academic claims that his career was ended after he publicly clashed with Prince Charles over the issue of alternative medicine. Prof Edzard Enrst believes that he was 'treated like dirt' after the Prince of Wales tried to 'silence' him. His new book, A Scientist in Wonderland, features the royal row and how it contributed to the loss of his job at the University of Exeter. Prof Edzard Ernst, left, claimed Prince Charles, right, ended his career when they clashed over the value homeopathic medicine after the royal's personal private secretary made a complaint about the academic . German-born Prof Ernst set up the UK's first chair in complementary medicine at the University of Exeter in 1993. But his rigorous application of evidence-based science and outspoken views soon found him at loggerheads with supporters of alternative therapies such as homeopathy, including the Prince of Wales. After being investigated over a complaint made by Charles's former private secretary, Sir Michael Peat, he retired early in 2011 and his department was closed. In his book, Prof Ernst describes the episode as 'the most unpleasant period of my entire professional life'. The trouble started in 2005 when Prof Ernst publicly attacked a draft report by economist Christopher Smallwood that had been personally commissioned by Charles. He described the report, which claimed complementary and alternative medicine (Cam) was cost effective and should be available on the NHS, as 'complete misleading rubbish'. But Prof Ernst was himself strongly criticised for disclosing the report's contents before they had been fully reviewed and published. On September 22, 2005, Sir Michael wrote an official letter of complaint on Clarence House notepaper to the University of Exeter's vice chancellor, citing a 'breach of confidence' after the professor had been sent an early and incomplete draft of the report for comment. Over the next 13 months, Prof Ernst says he was subjected to interrogations, 'dozens of cross-examining emails and letters' and 'treated as guilty until proven innocent'. Eventually he was told by the Vice Chancellor that a formal disciplinary warning 'would not be appropriate'. At the same time, he received a stern warning not to misbehave again. He wrote: 'I had been interrogated, investigated, treated like dirt for 13 months, and exonerated in the end. But even while acknowledging that I had not been guilty of any misdemeanour, my vice chancellor had issued an unambiguous warning to me: if I even thought of applying my personal ethical standards in any similar situation in the future, I would not be so lucky as to get away with it again. Prince Charles has been a major supporter of homeopathic medicine in Britain, lobbying the Government . 'Prince Charles's attempt to silence me, it seemed, had been successful.' In the years that followed, he says, support for his department dried up to the point where it could no longer function. Speaking in London, Prof Ernst said: 'I was innocent, but all support broke down. My unit of 20 co-workers was systematically destroyed.' Asked if he felt badly treated, he added: 'Badly is an understatement. My line manager said to me ""I know we're treating you like shit"". That is a quote.' Prof Ernst, who has had 48 books published and more than 1,000 articles in peer-reviewed journals, remains steadfastly opposed to unproven alternative treatments, and openly critical of the Prince of Wales. Prince Charles has never made a secret of his interest in homeopathy. In July 2013, he had a meeting with health minister Jeremy Hunt where he lobbied in favour of homeopathic medicine. Charles was understood to be unhappy that government plans to set up a register of practitioners of herbal and Chinese medicine – designed to give them an element of respectability – have stalled. Labour MP Paul Flynn said that by promoting ‘voodoo medicine’, Charles was putting himself in a ‘very dangerous position’ because as monarch he will have to be impartial. ‘The head of state, which he will soon be, has to remain above controversy. The only serious job of a head of state is to be above policy,’ Mr Flynn said. ‘If he wishes to lobby ministers, he should stand for Parliament or join a lobbying firm, but he should not be using his position as heir to the throne to do it.' Of Charles’s meeting with Mr Hunt, Clarence House said: ‘The Prince meets Government ministers from time to time in his role as heir to the throne as well as Privy Counsellor and this was one of those meetings. There was no specific agenda and a wide range of topics were discussed.’ In 2010, the then Labour Health Minister Mike O’Brien confirmed that Prince Charles had brought up homeopathy in meetings with Andy Burnham, who was then Health Secretary. In a chapter of his new book entitled Off With His Head, he writes: 'Prince Charles has continued to promote alternative medicine indefatigably, often showing himself unwilling or unable to distinguish between real health care and blatant quackery, between medicine and snake oil, or between the truth and some half-baked obsessions of his own.' He argues that while Charles no longer courts publicity as much as he used to, he continues to be an active proponent of alternative medicine while 'hiding' behind the facade of the College of Medicine. The charity, which advocates a holistic way of looking at health 'making the connection between mind, body and spirit', arose from the ruins of the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health which was disbanded in 2010. Prof Ernst insists he is not against all alternative or complementary therapies, and claims there is evidence that some, including certain herbal treatments and acupuncture, can be effective. Others he dismisses as a waste of time and money and potentially dangerous. He is especially scornful of homeopathy, which is based on extreme dilutions of substances that are supposed to help the body heal itself. Currently doctors can refer patients for homeopathy treatment on the NHS. 'For homeopathy we should be closing the book,' said Prof Ernst. 'They've had 200 years to prove that it's anything more than a placebo. That proof has failed, so let's now move on. 'Homeopathy is an example of a harmless treatment being quite harmful.' A Scientist In Wonderland is published on January 20 by Imprint Academic. A spokeswoman at Clarence House said: 'The Prince of Wales believes in combining the best of evidence-based, conventional medicine with an holistic approach to healthcare – treating the whole person rather than just the symptoms of disease and taking into account the effects on health of factors such as lifestyle, the environment and emotional well-being. 'His Royal Highness is Patron of over 30 healthcare organisations.'","Prof Edzard Ernst criticised a report commissioned by Prince Charles .

"Drunk driving is a big no-no, and apparently so is swimming while sloshed. In a new video mocking the repercussions of having just a little bit too much fun in the sun, a group of Australian youngsters have proved just how deadly alcohol consumption can be. Be warned - this clip is not for the fainthearted. The video was originally posted on YouTube by 22-year-old twin brothers Danny and Michael Philippou, who wanted to parody the old-fashioned infomercials they used to watch as children, but maintaining the important message. Speaking to MailOnline about the shocking video, which features a girl jumping to her death due to drinking and an increasingly bloody, yet darkly humorous sketch, the two filmmakers said they wanted to highlight the dangers of drinking and swimming. Danny told MailOnline: 'It's summer here in Australia with the weather reaching up to 45 degrees. Everyone here is either at the beach or in their pool. 'I know we take the p*** out of it, but alcohol related drownings is a pretty serious issue here and we wanted to shed some light on it (in our own twisted way). 'We hate those infomercials, it parodies the entire thing while still getting the message across.' Drunken madness: A new video set in Mount Isa, Queensland has a very powerful message about the dangers of drinking and swimming . The young filmmakers chose a place called Second Valley to shoot the video, claiming it is 'an infamous spot for drunks to hoon, drink and cliff dive.' They added: 'Hopefully anyone watching the video will think twice before drink swimming in the future, you never know when death is gonna rock up, run over your friend and send your car into the ocean killing everyone you've ever loved. BE WARNED!' At the start of the graphic video, a gang of male teens from Adelaide feel utterly invincible. Consequently, the know-it-alls ignore the warnings of Professor Bruce McGhandi, from the (fake) Mount Isa Accidental research center, who appears to be making a documentary about safe water play. The  academic says: 'What you are about to see will change your mind about drinking and swimming.' Invincible: The drunk teens don't listen to safety advice and begin jumping off cliffs like maniacs . Of course, the boys scream 'Ah p*** off mate', before throwing sand at him and fueling up on alcohol. That's where their fun begins...and soon ends. The young revellers begin flipping off cliffs and landing in the water beneath - cheering one another on as they crack open bottles of beer - in some astonishing footage which would make even the toughest bloke's stomach turn. It is obvious that something disastrous is about to occur, especially when a pretty new arrival appears. Taking a Grim turn: A young girl tries to impress the boys by downing alcohol and jumping off the cliff too but the Grim Reaper comes out to play... Standing on an even higher point of the cliff, 'Daisy' follows the boys lead and chugs her alcoholic beverage before jumping off. They try to persuade her not to as she could break a leg by falling into shallow water, however she ignores their pleas in a bid to prove she is tough too. The Grim Reaper suddenly emerges and lurks over her, symbolising how her actions are about to take her straight to death's door. Lo and behold, the next image that appears is of the girl lying face-down in a pool of blood at the bottom of the cliff. Shallow waters: She kills herself by smashing onto a rock pool below . Her screaming friends rush to her rescue and attempt to take her to hospital in a gruesome scene where her leg gets caught in the car door (an unpleasant squelch occurs as her limb is squashed). Covered in her blood, the boys are too drunk to control the car and end up hitting one of their friends on the road before he has the chance to climb in. 'I don't think its in reverse mate,' another boy frantically yells as the driver flies the vehicle off the pier. Hospital: Her friends try to rush her safety but they are too drunk to control the car and end up driving into the sea where they all join her in death . Graphic: Despite being very funny, this video is not for the faint-hearted . Better to be safe than sorry: They really ought to have listened to accident expert Professor Bruce McGhandi . As the car floods with its passengers roaring for help, the Grim Reaper returns to reveal their fate. Meanwhile, the responsible professor floats nearby in a rubber boat to give some last minute words of wisdom. 'You know alcohol numbs your senses,' he states before teasing the last remaining boy with his rowing stick. 'You want it? You can't have it!' Then the drunken young man is then drowned by the Grim Reaper.

"Teaching assistant Andrew Tetley had an affair with a 15-year-old pupil but was spared jail after a judge accepted his claim he thought she was 16 . A teaching assistant who had an affair with a 15-year-old pupil has been spared jail after a judge accepted his claim he thought she was 16. Andrew Tetley, 28, who worked at a school in Lancashire, did not have sex with the girl, but they had kissed and sent explicit photographs of themselves to one another. Preston Crown Court was told that Tetley, who had also touched the girl's breast, believed she was 16, despite having access to records which would have confirmed her age. He admitted sexual activity with a child as a person in a position of trust, but was handed a six-month jail term, suspended for two years. Judge Andrew Woolman told Tetley the sentence was suspended because the background to the case meant it was 'unnecessary' to lock him up, and said he would not need to sign the sex offender's register. However, he is banned from working with children. The court was told the relationship came to light when the school's assistant headteacher heard rumours of a sexual relationship between the pair. Lisa Worsley, prosecuting,  said: 'As a result of hearing these rumours, [the assistant head] spoke to her and her phone was taken from her. 'On looking at the contacts it transpired that Mr Tetley's mobile number appeared in there under the name ""Andy"".' Miss Worsley said that the girl explained her first contact with keep fit fanatic Tetley was via Instagram. She later told police she and Tetley had initially talked about her career prospects but she became sexually attracted to him due to his good looks. She said both realised their meetings were wrong and tried to stop. 'Initially they talked about career stuff and had a laugh,' said the prosecutor. 'She regarded him as good looking.' Miss Worsley said the pair exchanged telephone numbers and continued to speak and in interview the girl said that they had met up within a couple of days of making contact but knew 'it was wrong'. She said it was she who suggested meeting up and Andrew responded saying they were doing enough by talking.' The court heard that the pair had met twice over three months when they had visited a pub, with both occasions initiated by the girl, who was just weeks away from her 16th birthday. During these meetings, they had talked and kissed, and on one occasion he had touched her breast. Miss Worsley said: 'She said it was proper kissing, with tongues, and she was happy with what he had done.' During a police interview, the girl said the pair had exchanged a series of explicit messages involving their sexual fantasies and where they could have sex. 'He asked for photos of her and there were very sexual conversations,' Miss Worsley added. Preston Crown Court was told that fitness fanatic Tetley had sent the girl photographs of himself topless . Preston Crown Court was told that Tetley, who had also touched the girl's breast, believed she was 16, despite having access to records which would have confirmed her age . 'She sent him pictures of her upper body naked and in underwear and he sent pictures of his top body. 'After a bit they both realised it was wrong and tried to stop. He had access to her registration forms and could have had the ability to check her age if he wanted to.' David Traynor, defending, said Tetley, of Leyland, Lancashire, believed the girl was 16 years of age and contact was established by her rather than the defendant. Judge Andrew Woolman (pictured) sentenced the assistant on the basis that he thought she was 16 . He said: 'The meetings were suggested by the girl rather than the defendant. 'There was no element of coercion at any stage and it's the defendant that broke off contact a month or so prior to his arrest. 'He was in a new role as a teaching assistant and he felt he was not coping with the situation. 'His employment has gone, his reputation has gone and he's going to struggle in future to get other forms of employment.' Sentencing Tetley, Judge Woolman said: 'A child is somebody under the age of 18 not under 16 but you were under a position of trust and had been appointed as a temporary teacher. 'You were in a position of trust and you knew perfectly well you should have been the one saying no and putting a stop to contact of an indecent nature. 'Certainly when she suggested meeting you should have said no. In the end you met twice, the first time you were kissing and talking in he car, the second time it went a bit further. 'Fortunately you didn't proceed to full sex. I sentence you on the basis you thought she was 16, although I observe you had the means to find out. 'Fortunately you didn't go any further...and didn't participate in full sexual activity. 'I accept that you brought the relationship to the end but I suspect that was because you knew rumours were circulating. 'I sentence you on the basis that she was 16 and you had the means of finding out if you wanted to. 'You are 28 years old, a bright young man and you have rather wrecked your future for the moment. It's unnecessary to deprive you of your liberty immediately.' Tetley, who was suspended from his job when the allegations came to light, was also ordered to pay a victim surcharge.","Andrew Tetley, 28, had kissed and sent explicit photos to the girl .

"US presidential hopeful Bobby Jindal has parroted claims there are 'no-go zones' for non-Muslims in Britain - just one week after Fox News was forced to apologise for the same gaffe. Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal said in a speech to the Henry Jackson Society, in London, that  Muslims have been allowed to establish autonomous neighbourhoods, governed by a harsh version of Islamic law, and which police refuse to go into. He said some immigrants are seeking 'to colonise Western countries, because setting up your own enclave and demanding recognition of a no-go zone are exactly that.' It comes just one week after a Fox News pundit claimed that Birmingham is closed to non-Muslims sparking a backlash from bemused residents of the city. Scroll down for video . Visiting US presidential hopeful Bobby Jindal has claimed there are 'no-go zones' for non-Muslims in Britain - just one week after Fox News was forced to apologise for a similar gaffe . Steven Emerson, a self-styled expert on terrorism, was participating in a Fox News discussion in the wake of the attacks on Charlie Hebdo's office in Paris. 'In Britain, it's not just no-go zones,' he claimed. 'There are actual cities like Birmingham that are totally Muslim where non-Muslims just simply don't go in.' Prime Minister David Cameron responded by calling Emerson a 'complete idiot', adding: 'When I heard this, frankly I choked on my porridge.' The pundit later apologised for his blunder - just 22 per cent of the city's residents are Muslim, compared to 46 per cent describing themselves as Christian. Amidst the backlash, he announced that he would donate £500 to Birmingham Children's Hospital in a bid to atone for his 'terrible, inexcusable error'. Mr Jindal said: 'The huge issue, the big issue in non-assimilation is the fact that you have people that want to come to our country but not adopt our values, not adopt our language and in some cases want to set apart their own enclaves and hold onto their own values' It comes just one week after Fox News pundit Steven Emerson claimed that Birmingham is closed to non-Muslims,  sparking a backlash from bemused residents of the city . Jindal, however, used similar rhetoric during a speech, warning of 'no-go zones' in London and other Western cities. He also said Muslim leaders must condemn the people who commit terrorism in the name of faith as 'murderers who are going to hell.' The Republican - who lived in England while studying at Oxford as a Rhodes scholar - is considering a presidential campaign in 2016. Three members of a so-called 'Muslim Patrol' were jailed in 2013 at the Old Bailey for repeatedly trying to enforce Sharia law in East London. Jordan Horner and another Islamic extremist told one couple they could not hold hands while walking down the street, because it was in a 'Muslim area'. The radicals also attacked a group of men drinking in the road, and told a woman she would face 'hell fire' because of the way she was dressed. Horner, 19, Ricardo MacFarlane, 36, and a 23-year-old man who cannot be named for legal reasons were sentenced to 68 weeks, 12 months and 24 weeks in prison respectively. He later defended — and repeated — the statement after facing reporters' questions about his claims. 'I knew that by speaking the truth we were going to make people upset,' Jindal told CNN during an interview from London. 'The huge issue, the big issue in non-assimilation is the fact that you have people that want to come to our country but not adopt our values, not adopt our language and in some cases want to set apart their own enclaves and hold onto their own values,' said Jindal. 'I think that's dangerous.' 'The bigger point is that radical Islam is a threat to our way of life,' Jindal said. Asked if he regretted talking about 'no-go zones,' Jindal replied: 'Not at all.' During the CNN interview, he also said that there were areas where women did not feel comfortable going 'without a veil' and where police refused to go. Jindal, whose parents immigrated to the United States from India more than 40 years ago, is in his second term as governor of Louisiana and is barred by law from seeking a third term later this year. The 43-year-old is already laying the groundwork for a presidential bid. Jindal spoke to the Henry Jackson Society, a British think tank named for a former U.S. Democratic senator from Washington state who was a presidential candidate in the 1970s. Democrats said Jindal's comments were a blunder. 'It's no surprise that Bobby Jindal would go abroad and butcher the facts in an effort to divide people; this is exactly what we've come to expect from Jindal here at home,' said Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Rebecca Chalif. 'Jindal is just embarrassing himself.'","Bobby Jindal said  immigrants seeking 'to colonize Western countries'

"For those situations where there aren't enough public toilets nearby for the amount of people, new app Airpnp is here to save the day. Through this revolutionary new mobile app, inspired by Airbnb, residents and businesses can rent out their loos to people in their immediate location who simply need to go. Users are even able to rate their experiences afterward so others can see how each toilet stacks up. In instances where you really need to use the loo - but aren't near your home - simply log-on to Airpnp . First conceived of in New Orleans during Mardi Gras, co-founders Travis Laurendine and Max Gaudin routinely experienced the pain of having to pee - without having a place to do it. Often, visitors and locals alike would opt for a 'rogue pee,' as they describe it, which demonstrated to them the need for a legal alternative. Currently, the app's most popular areas are New Orleans and - surprisingly - Antwerp, Belgium, but after a quick search, it's clear that some of Central London is hopping on board, as well. Many of the options we came across were posted by students, advertising their university's washroom facilities. From the MailOnline's location, we were able to locate four toilets-for-rent, relatively nearby, in Marylebone . For those who need a shower and toilet in Central London - and have cash to spare - look no further! That said, we also saw a 'spacious with a shower and very private' advert in Marylebone for £4 per use. The NY Post likewise investigated Airpnp's prevalence, but in New York City, and found a handful of private addresses, as well as a 'cozy loft-style bathroom' on Smith Street, Brooklyn, at the OrangeYouGlad graphic design studio. While the bathroom at the back of the office space wasn't sparkling clean, it did boast a large stack of old Esquire magazines, fancy hand soap and 'Poo Pourri' fragrance spray. 'If you're on a busy street in New York, you're literally surrounded by hundreds of toilets but you can't use them because they are in people's apartments,' app founder Travel Laurendine explained to the Post. Now, with the click of a button, you can check if the toilet is available. The owner then gets a call and can decide if they want to lend out their facilities.","New mobile app, inspired by Airbnb, locates nearby (available) toilets .

"Unlike most men going through a break-up, Dean Kremer did not go out and get drunk with his mates. Instead he started collecting replica Star Wars lightsabers. Now the Darwin man is selling them off and the money will go towards buy a home with his new girlfriend.

Dean Kremer (pictured with a Luke Skywalker lightsaber), 33, is looking to sell off his collection of 10 Master Replica lightsabers . The lightsaber was made famous by the Star Wars saga, which starred Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker (above) The Darwin man started collecting the lightsabers after he broke up with his ex-girlfriend . After being with his girlfriend Maria for three years, Mr Kremer decided it was time to sell off the Master Replica lightsabers, which are no longer manufactured. '[They] reminded me of the break-up with the ex-girlfriend. I started collecting after the break-up,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'The new girlfriend is very indifferent about it and we're going to use the funds for something better. 'Hopefully towards a house and something more constructive.' The collection includes a Darth Vader one (left) and the purchase comes with a custom cabinet with fluorescent down lights .

Mr Kremer said he started collecting the lightsabers five years ago because he was not much of a drinker. 'I'm just applying paperback psychology to this. I wanted to remind myself of good childhood memories. It was like a post break-up depression, I guess,' he said. 'I’m not much of a partier or a drinker. It wasn't really my style, especially in response to a break up.' He said he bought them to remind him of better times and hanging out with his cousins during his childhood . Mr Kremer said the lightsabers reminded him of the time he spent hanging out with his cousins. 'My cousins were a lot more well off and when we visited their homes, they would have all these Star Wars toys,' he said. '[I would play] with my cousins in their home and play with the older kids toys. 'We can also relate to that because the older kids always had better toys than the younger kids.' To get your hands on the collection, Mr Kremer is advertising the lightsabers for $3,000 on Gumtree.

"It is not very often that you can get a camera this close to deadly molten lava - especially while it oozes into the Pacific Ocean. However, a 51-year-old extreme landscape photographer from Hawaii braved the rough waters  during a brief period of calm and managed to capture the Kilauea volcano eruption in all its glory. The stunning footage - taken somewhere in between Waikupanaha and the Hawaii Volcano National Park, off the coast of the Big Island - is almost therapeutic to watch as fiery fluid plunges underwater where it will transform into land. A hot situation: Molten lava  from the erupting Kilauea volcano pours into the Pacific Ocean off Hawaii . Recalling his time filming the scene in April 2013,  Kawika Singson says: 'On this particular day the ocean was fairly calm and my window of opportunity was there, so I took it. 'You can also see this crazy thrill-seeking kayaker in the foreground. He probably was saying the same thing about me: ""Who's that crazy dude with the camera?"".' Molten matter is hotter than 1,650 degrees Fahrenheit (900 Celsius), according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Surrounded by clouds of poisonous smoke in the clip, the way the lava drools from Kilauea looks like something from the set of Game of Thrones. Seizing the opportunity: Hawaiian photographer Kawika Singson took advantage of the waters being calmer than normal and waded in to produce this footage in April 2013 . Daredevil: The 51-year-old remained only a short distance from the lava flow and made sure to wear protective gear to prevent burning . It's amazing to think that this hyperactive volcano - the youngest on Hawaii's Big Island - has been erupting continuously since 1983. Indeed, the way that the bright orange liquid contrasts against the blue palette of the ocean and sky, makes for one of the most powerful and picturesque visions that nature has to offer. Speaking to The Huffington Post, Kawika  remembers just how difficult it was to get close to lava and the importance of keeping safe by staying 'on top of your game'. The daredevil says: 'The videos can only show you so much, but to actually be there, to feel the heat. ... The heat is one thing, but the gases are extremely toxic.' However, Kawika is very experienced in his field and owns all the right gear - including fireproof boots and long-sleeved clothing to prevent severe burning. 'Sometimes, after a day of filming, I shake my head and think, man, that was pretty stupid to do what I just did,' he adds. 'Still, that's not going to stop me from doing what I want to do.' 'Sometimes I think that was pretty stupid!' Looking back, the Hawaain local cannot believe some of the dangerous situations he puts himself into .","Kilauea volcano is one of the most active on Earth and has been erupting for over 30 years .

"Sarah Palin has taken aim at 'Hollywood leftists' who have criticized American Sniper, the new Clint Eastwood-directed movie . Sarah Palin has taken aim at ‘Hollywood leftists’ who have criticized American Sniper, the new Clint Eastwood-directed movie about the life of deceased Navy SEAL Chris Kyle. The movie, which stars Bradley Cooper as Kyle, has triggered a heated  debate about patriotism, with documentary filmmaker Michael Moore and Seth Rogan both taking heat  for criticizing it. Palin took to Facebook on Monday night to accuse critics of the movie - which raked in a massive $107 million on its debut weekend at the North American box office - of ‘spitting on the graves’ of military heroes. ‘God bless our troops, especially our snipers,’ she wrote. ‘Hollywood leftists: while caressing shiny plastic trophies you exchange among one another while spitting on the graves of freedom fighters who allow you to do what you do, just realize the rest of America knows you're not fit to shine Chris Kyle's combat boots. Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore caused uproar when he tweeted that he was raised to believe snipers were 'cowards' because his uncle was killed by a Japanese sniper shot during World War II. Taking to Twitter in rage, the Fahrenheit 9/11 director seethed: 'My uncle killed by sniper in WW2. We were taught snipers were cowards. Will shoot u in the back. Snipers aren't heroes. And invaders r worse.' Moore later backtracked his comments on Facebook, writing that he thought the film was well made but could have done a better job at contextualizing the Iraq War. Scroll down for video . Both Michael Moore, left, and Seth Rogen, have taken heat after posting tweets critical of American Sniper, the Clint Eastwood-directed movie based on the life of deceased Navy SEAL Chris Kyle . Rogen caused a stir after he likened the movie to a Nazi propaganda film. 'American Sniper kind of reminds me of the movie that's showing in the third act of Inglorious Basterds,' he tweeted on Sunday. Quentin Tarantino's Inglorius Basterds culminates with an assassination attempt on Adolph Hitler at the premiere of a fictional propaganda film called Stolz der Nation which translates to Nation's Pride. One of the characters of the film is a haughty German soldier who plays himself in Nation's Pride, a movie about how he killed 200 Allied soldiers from a clock tower in one battle. The comedian later attempted to backtrack his comments, tweeting that there is a big difference between a ‘comparison’ and ‘kinda reminded me.’ Palin wasn’t the only Republican unhappy about Rogen and Moore’s criticisms. American Sniper has racked up six Oscar nominations, including best picture and best actor for star Bradley Cooper . Arizona Congressman Paul Gosar also took to Facebook and published a reaction to Moore’s comments from Sean Johnson, a former Marine who works in his office as a veterans liaison. 'I personally know what our snipers do. I have worked with these guys. Calling them cowards wouldn't faze them one bit but it would amuse them, coming from a soft, Hollywood leftist like Michael Moore. 'If anyone knows cowards it might be him … pray for Michael Moore to one day understand that his liberty to attack snipers like Chris Kyle is only possible because of these brave patriots,' wrote Johnson. Kyle, who served four tours in Iraq, is credited with being the military's most lethal sniper saving hundreds of American lives with at least 160 kills. The 38-year-old was killed in 2013 at a shooting range in Texas, allegedly at the hands of a fellow soldier with PTSD that he was trying to help. Palin took to Facebook on Monday night to accuse critics of the movie - which raked in a massive $107 million on its debut weekend at the North American box office - of ‘spitting on the graves’ of military heroes . American Sniper, based on Kyle’s memoir, blasted into first place with a massive $107 million on its debut weekend at the North American box office, a record for a January opening, industry figures showed on Tuesday.

Jaqueline Summers, an international playmate and Playboy covergirl, has denied she used former employees wages to fund her surgeries and travel to Los Angeles . Ms Kingi worked for Ms Summers for two years, and claims that the Playboy model owes over $50,000 in wages, superannuation, and rent, reportedA Current Affair. 'She's taken advantage of myself and the other staff members...I'm exposing her for what she's done for us,' said Ms Kingi. Ms Kingi claims that Ms Summers, a mother of two, took the money she owed her staff and her landlord, and used it to purchase plastic surgery, and a lavish international lifestyle. Ms Summers, who calls herself 'an international playmate', graced the covers of Playboy Slovakia, and used money that was legally entitled to her employees to fund her dream of becoming a full-time Playboy Bunny, claims A Current Affair. In September 2014, Ms Summers closed down both of the hair and beauty salons she owned to move to Los Angeles, allegedly leaving several of her former employees short nearly $10,000.

Stacey, pictured, left, at her heaviest, and right, now with her son, started gaining weight when she was working as a sports sales manager and would eat greasy English breakfasts . Stacey, who used to be a size 24, started gaining weight when she was working as a sports sales manager. She would eat greasy English breakfasts, three course pub lunches and would snack on crisps and chocolate while she travelled with work and stayed in hotels overnight. Her busy job meant that she did not have time to cook or prepare a proper meals. Speaking about her lifestyle at the time, she said: 'It was horrible hearing a doctor saying I was putting on so much weight. I didn't need anyone to tell me that but I didn't do anything about it. 'I got bigger and bigger, and I was completely addicted to fatty foods. I couldn't resist tucking into a McDonald's or a full English, I really enjoyed eating them. I also enjoyed a few glasses of wine whenever I ate at the pub and would always have a pudding.' Stacey's efforts saw her drop eight dress sizes. Over the course of seven months she documented her progress on Facebook and soon had people contacting her from around the world asking for advice . She added: 'Then I became really miserable. I couldn't fit into any of my nice dresses and I had to start buying really unattractive clothes.' But the reality of her weight gain only hit Stacey when her son, Ross, now 14, could not fit his arms around her to give her a hug for his Christmas presents. 'Christmas 2011 was the turning point in my life. I couldn't even get up a set of stairs without gasping for breath,' she said.

Stacey, who is also also mother to Ryan, 20, and Alex, 17, said: 'My husband Graham and the kids were horrified that I was crying on Christmas Day and were desperate to comfort me. I stared at myself in the mirror and couldn't believe that I had let myself get this big. 'But that shock was enough, it gave me the kick I needed and I vowed to change my life and lose weight. I didn't want the kids to end up like me.' Stacey can now wear bikinis and fitted size 8-10 dresses - and can even fit into one of the legs of a pair of trousers that she used to wear before her weight loss .

Stacey, who trains and holds classes at DW fitness club in Sunderland, is now focusing her efforts on body-building and plans to enter competitions later in the year. She said: 'Now the next step for me is body building. 'I want to tone up and build up muscle and eventually enter myself into competitions. I've already made a start and I lift weights about three or four times a week, which is tough but I know I can do it.' She added: 'Graham and the boys are so proud of me and I feel incredible. I have so much confidence and want others to feel like that.

All work and no play: More than a fifth of married men and 17.8 per cent of women said they were too tired from work to make love (stock image) Android loving: A 2013 documentary explored the rising number of young Japanese men preferring virtual relationships to actual real-life women . This is a shockingly low figure when compared to Greater London's rate of 135,000 children born to a population of just 8.3million. In 2013, a BBC Documentary called No Sex Please, We're Japanese looked into the declining rate of sex in Japan. The show explored the emergence of young Japanese straight men preferring virtual relationships to actual real-life women. 'Why would you get into something as messy, as troubling, as disorienting as a relationship when you could have a virtual girlfriend, a virtual experience, that maybe is even superior to the reality?,' one young man, Roland, says in the documentary. 'I do know a number of men in Japan who use the role play games, the dating SIMS, even advances in pornography, and would rather experience the opposite sex that way than go through the challenges of relationships.' Roland added that the modern Japanese woman 'find men wanting' and that the new generation want independence before settling down.","Research found that 49.3 per cent had not had sex in the last month .

"A husband has been found guilty of beating and choking his wife to death on Valentine's Day - just hours before she was to testify against him in a child abuse case. Jacob Pearman, 32, was convicted of first-degree murder by a jury in Rutherford County, Tennessee on Tuesday morning, a day after closing arguments wrapped up. Pearman, who had admitted to killing his wife Carla in the early hours of February 14, 2013, will likely spend life in prison when he is sentenced, the Daily News Journal reported. He was also convicted of child abuse and aggravated assault for kicking and choking his wife's eight-year-old son on December 14, 2012. He was tried on all charges at the same time. Scroll down for video . Convicted: Jacob Pearman, pictured in court, has been found guilty of first-degree murder for the beating and choking death of his wife, Carla Pearman, at their Murfreesboro, Tennessee home in 2013 . Carla Pearman had been due in court on February 14, 2013 to testify in the child abuse case involving her husband and her son from a previous relationship. Prosecutors said that her husband killed her because she chose not to testify on his behalf. After her death, her husband gave a sworn statement to Murfreesboro Police saying he was 'upset about the court date' and had fought with her over what she would testify. In the hours before her death, he fought with his wife over text messages  and when he returned home, he found his clothes packed, he told the police. 'We continued to talk/argue until 1 a.m.' Jacob Pearman said in the statement. 'We spoke with my mother over speakerphone. At that time I was suicidal, not homicidal.' But he turned on Carla, beating and strangling her - before putting her body back in her bed. Afterwards he searched for his gun to take his life and called his parents to tell them what had happened. Jacob Pearman's mother Donna testified how her son called her husband in the early hours of February 14, 2013. Killed: He killed his wife (pictured together) because refused to testify in his favor in his child abuse trial later that day, prosecutors said. He was accused of child abuse after kicking and choking her son . Locked up: After killing her, Pearman (left in his mug shot) put his wife's dead body into their bed . 'I remember my husband fell on his knees,' she told the court. 'That's when I called 911.' Pearman was picked up at a gas station later that morning. When he was arrested by Manchester Police, he had blood on his shorts, an officer testified. Murfreesboro Police found Carla Pearman's body in the couple's bed and an autopsy later revealed that she had been beaten and strangled to death. 'These acts were not only savage and brutal, but they were intentional,' Assistant District Attorney J. Paul Newman said in his closing arguments. 'This was a savage murder and Carla Pearman fought to live. It was a struggle she could not win.' The jury heard how investigators found Pearman's DNA underneath his wife's fingernails, indicating that there had been a struggle. Before her death, Carla told her friend Megan Porter that Jacob Pearman had bought a gun and threatened to kill her for not testifying in his favor, Porter testified, WSMV reported. Confession: The court was shown a video of Pearman confessing to the killing later that day, pictured . Scene: When he arrived home (pictured)  the night of her death - and the night before his child abuse court case - he found that she had packed his belongings and wanted him to get out . While Pearman's mother testified that Carla had said she wanted to have his children, other friends said that the woman feared for her life and wanted to protect her son. At the time of her death, Carla Pearman's son had moved to Chattanooga to live with his birth father following the abuse incident in December 2012. 'I knew exactly what she was going to do,' said her friend Steve Matranga. 'He packed his stuff, removed the remote from the vehicle. Had to get him out of the house. The next day was the court date.' But Jacob Pearman's attorney Luke Evans said his client had admitted to killing his wife on Valentine's Day but insisted it was not premeditated. 'He killed her; he did it,' Evans said. 'But truth is Jacob Pearman did not premeditatedly kill his wife.'

"An Orlando photographer had a hairy moment when a black bear decided to try its paw at car washing. Red Huber had nearly finished washing his car in his Longwood neighborhood driveway when he 'had the strange feeling' someone was watching him.' Huber then spotted the young animal staring at him from about 20 feet away, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Scroll down for video . Red Huber was rinsing off his vehicle in his Longwood neighborhood driveway in Orlando when he spotted a young black bear staring at him from about 20 feet away . The Orlando Sentinel photographer said he and the bear locked eyes and froze in place for a few seconds. But the bear then turned its attention to the garden hose and Mr Huber's photographic instincts took over as he carefully moved toward his garage to grab his camera. As the emboldened black bear dipped its paw into a soapy pail of water, Mr Huber was able to take pictures of the cheeky would-be carwasher. The bear then tipped the pail over, watched the suds run down the cement driveway and scampered away into a nearby wooded  area. The Florida Black Bear is a subspecies of the North American Black Bear and is Florida's largest native land animal. The animal is most active in the area in October and November when preparing for the winter. Black bears are found in most parts of North America and, despite being less dangerous to humans than their bigger grizzly cousins, adults can still weigh up to 550lb. in Central Florida, sprawling subdivisions have sprung up in former bear habitats and along their natural corridors around the Ocala National Forest.

"Two inmates have committed suicide in one week at a controversial Ohio jail known for prisoners taking their own lives. The men were housed at Licking County Jail in Newark, where five staff members lost their jobs last year after an inmate suicide and several other suicide attempts. The Columbus Dispatch reports on Tuesday that Jeffrey Skeele, 27, died at Ohio State University's medical center on Saturday, eight days after deputies discovered him with a bed sheet around his neck. Commit suicide: Jeffrey Skeele, 27, died at Ohio State University's medical center on Saturday, eight days after deputies discovered him with a bed sheet around his neck . The paper says inmate Spencer McLaughlin, 46, died at the medical center Wednesday, two days after deputies found him with a sheet also tied around his neck. Skeele who was arrested on January 6 for credit card theft was checked 30 minutes prior to his committing suicide. 'I am very devastated,' said Skeele’s mother, Sandra Kay Skeele, 53. 'In my opinion, I don't think the inmates were properly looked at when they came in and when they do rounds.' Skeele's father Jeffrey A. Skeele, 55, says he hasn't gotten any information regarding his son's death from the prison. 'I'd like to have some answers,' he said. 'He was a good son,' Sandra Skeele added. Theft: Jeffrey Skeele, pictured with a female friend, who was arrested on January 6 for credit card theft was checked in hus cell 30 minutes prior to his committing suicide . 'He brought smiles to my heart.' McLaughlin hanged himself a day after he was arrested on a felony count of telephone harassment and was checked just seven minutes before the suicide. Sheriff Randy Thorp calls the deaths frustrating because, 'obviously we care.' The prison has a history of inmate suicides. In May 2014, 67-year-old Stanton Deeley died in his jail cell by suicide just one hour before he was going to accept a plea deal for burglary charges, . Following Deeley's death three other inmates attempted suicide, including a woman who jumped from a top floor stairwell. History of suicides: The prisoners were housed at Licking County Jail in Newark, where five staff members lost their jobs last year after an inmate suicide and several other suicide attempts . Both the woman and a correction officer who tried to grab her before her jump went flying off the railing 20 feet from the ground. Neither were seriously injured but in response Sheriff Thorp ordered an investigation of his jail policies and records. It was revealed that staff didn't do their mandatory bed checks and that they lied about doing their rounds. Three other inmates killed themselves in 2011, including a man named William Overbey. His wife Christina filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against the county and the prison personnel. In response to the 2011 suicides netting was placed along the floor to prevent inmates from jumping. This week the jail added a member to their mental health staff. 'Before the three (suicides) in 2011, it had been eight years since an inmate here had committed suicide, and it’s not like we were doing something then that we’re not doing now,' Thorp said. 'But one is too many, and it’s our job and our goal to find a way to stop this.'","Jeffrey Skeele, 27, died at Ohio State University's medical center on Saturday after deputies discovered him with a bed sheet around his neck .

"Julianne Moore isn't just the leading nominees for best actress at this year's Oscars - she's also helping to design the backstage green room. Architectural Digest, which has been the official sponsor of the luxurious space since 2003, announced today that the Still Alice star will consult on the room's look and help choose furniture and decor for the celebrity enclave. The 54-year-old actress, who is nominated in her category alongside the likes of Reese Witherspoon and Rosamund Pike, will use her own experience of 'what it's like to be backstage on Oscar night' in order to ensure that the stars-only hangout comes complete with every comfort she and her fellow celebrities might need. Firm favorite: After picking up both a Critics Choice Award (L) and a Golden Globe (R) for her role in Still Alice, Julianne Moore is believed to be a shoo-in for this year's Oscar . Multi-talented: In the movie, Ms Moore, 54, plays a linguistics professor who is diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's . It is not the first time that Ms Moore has worked alongside the magazine; in 2012, the garden of her home in New York City's West Village was featured in the publication, with writer Simon Doonan waxing lyrical about the actress' design talents. 'Had she not become an actress, Julianne Moore could definitely have been a decorator, and a successful one at that,' he wrote. 'Furniture, design, construction, renovation, and all manner of zhuzh - these are her obsessions.' Last year, the prestigious honor of decorating the green room was given to Academy Award winner Susan Sarandon, who worked alongside renowned architect David Rockwell in order to transform the spaceinto a five star retreat for every famous face who stepped out on the stage throughout the night, be it to collect an award, or to present one. Ms Sarandon, 68, curated a digital collection of Oscars-themed images, which were showcased in the space throughout the ceremony. Ultimate luxury: Last year's space featured a digital display of Oscars-themed images . Design team: Oscar winner Susan Sarandon teamed up with architect David Rockwell in order to design 2014's green room . This year's room will see Ms Moore collaborating with Los Angeles-based design collective Commune, however little else is known about what they have planned for the design. No doubt the multi-talented mother-of-two is hoping that she will get the opportunity to enjoy a celebration inside the space; having snagged both a Golden Globe and a Critics Choice Award for her role in drama Still Alice, Ms Moore is, unsurprisingly, the firm favorite to be awarded the Best Actress gong at this year's ceremony. It is the fifth time that Ms Moore has been nominated for an Academy Award, having been pipped to the post in both the Best Actress and the Best Supporting Actress categories in 2002. But despite her seemingly unstoppable wins at this season's award ceremonies, the actress admitted that she was stunned to have received another Oscar nod. 'Thank u everyone for the congratulations!' she tweeted just minutes after she was named by Chris Pine and Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs in Beverly Hills.

"An 81-year-old Michigan man met his son for the first time on Sunday. Tony Trapani of Grand Rapids was cleaning out some filing cabinets following the death of his wife when he discovered a letter written over 50 years by a woman revealing that she had given birth to a son, and he was the father. That son, Samuel Childress, who was just five-years-old when the letter was written, is now 61. Scroll down for video . Reunited: Tony Trapani (right) met his 61-year-old son Samuel Childress (left) for the first time on Sunday . As for why his wife would intercept and hide the letter for all these years, Trapani points out the difficulties the couple faced trying to have children of their own. 'She wanted children,' said Trapani of his late wife in an interview with Fox 17. 'She couldn’t have any. She tried and tried.' That being said, Trapani still seems to resent her decision, no matter what her motivation may have been, saying; 'He’s my full son that I’ve had my whole life, but why my wife hid that letter is beyond me.' The reunion was just as poignant for Childress, who long ago resigned himself to the fact that he had been abandoned by his father. 'Just to know him now is so important to me. It’s going to fill that void,' said the man, who spent his youth in Pennsylvania. Lost time: Childress' mother wrote Trapani with the news of his son over 50 years ago, but his wife hid the letter (above) As for the letter, written in 1959, it began; 'I have a little boy. He is five years old now. What I’m trying to say Tony is he is your son. He was born November 14th, 1953.' When he never responded, Childress' mother simply assumed the man wanted nothing to do with the boy, and informed the child of his decision. 'I always asked my mom, I said, ""Well what does he look like?""' says Childress. 'She said, ""Well, go look in the mirror.""' And while the two men are enjoying their time together, and all the catching up they have to do, they are still planning a paternity test just to make certain this news is not too good to be true.","Tony Trapani of Grand Rapids, Michigan  discovered a letter written by a woman revealing that she had given birth to a son, and he was the father .

"KFC may have disqualified Taylor Swift from a coveted Triple J Hottest 100 spot after the fast food chain launched a campaign endorsing the pop icon in the lead up to the annual Australia Day countdown. The fast food giant jumped on the frenzied social media attempt to include the starlet in the Triple J Hottest 100, a campaign which has sparked both waves of support and fury from polarised music lovers. The fast food chain offered a $19.89 voucher, in reference to the pop star's latest album 1989, to customers who posted their favourite Swift song- a move which may breach the countdown's strict  policy of banning artists who give their fans incentives to vote. Scroll down for video . KFC is offering a $19.89 voucher, in reference to the pop stars latest album 1989, which may see Taylor Swift disqualified from the Triple J Hottest 100 . 'The #‎tay4hottest100 campaign is going strong and she’s got our vote,' KFC announced on it's Facebook page last Thursday. 'Tell us which Taylor song is your favourite for your chance to win a voucher for $19.89! (Generous, we know). #‎taylortribute'. The voucher may be in direct violation of the Triple J Hottest 100 voting rules, which clearly state that the station will 'remove artists from the list who have benefited from competitions or commercial campaigns that incentivise fans to vote for them'. While ABC has declined to comment officially, former Triple J announcer Angela Catterns told The Drum on Monday that Swift had been disqualified. 'You probably know that there was a push to get a Taylor Swift song in (the Hottest 100), which has now been disqualified because a fast food chain became involved in the whole process,' Ms Catterns said. Take that! If Taylor's number 75 ranking on Social Hottest 100 is an accurate prediction, hipsters nationwide may well hurl into a fits of range come Australia Day when the ABC radio station's annual alternative music poll hits the airwaves . Haters gonna hate! Swift's catchy tune Shake It Off has a good chance at cracking Triple J's Hottest 100 . The response to the potential blow KFC may have dealt to the #tay4hottest100campaign  has been as divided as the movement itself. 'Thank you KFC!!! You just invalidated this song from being in the hottest 100 by commercially incentivising it!!!' said one Facebook user. 'I hope that was your plan all along this just made my day as now I know the hottest 100 wont be tainted by this rubbish'. 'You've ruined #Tay4Hottest100 KFC! Arrghh!!!' said another user. Other social media commentators were pleased with the seemingly unintended outcome. 'Fantastic. For the first time ever KFC has done something useful and gotten Taylor Swift disqualified from the hottest 100,' said one Facebook user. 'if this is the reason swift gets disqualified from the hottest 100 then I hereby pledge to only eat KFC when I have that fast food craving....' said another. A spokesperson for KFC .

Earlier on Tuesday, an unofficial poll shed some  insight into who might take home the coveted Triple J Hottest 100 crown, with Swift making the cut despite the controversy. If Taylor's number 75 ranking on Social Hottest 100 is an accurate prediction, many hipsters nationwide may well hurl into fits of rage come Australia Day when the ABC radio station's annual alternative music poll hits the airwaves. Harsh: In retaliation, extreme alternative music fans with a penchant for violent threats then took to social media to intimidate Taylor supporters . More than 20,000 votes were tallied to come up with the Shake It Off singer's double digit spot, beating out hits by Triple J favourites Vance Joy and Banks. Peking Duk ft. Nicole Miller's tune High came in at number one while Chet Faker takes second and third position with Talk Is Cheap and 1998, respectively. Milky Chance are at number four with Stolen Chance, and Peking Duk return in fifth place for Take Me Over ft. Safia. 'Here we go, after countless hours of tallying the votes of those kind individuals who shared them on social media, our predicted #hottest100,' the poll's Twitter account wrote. Songs that are eligible for the list this year have to be released between December 1, 2013 and November 30, 2014, according to the radio station's site. The campaign to get Taylor on the list kicked off after super fan Joe McKenzie tweeted ABC boss Mark Scott about the omission of Swift's hit Shake It Off from the voting list. Nasty: 'I hope you die a slow, painful death,' one wrote to a voter, while another compared a fan to ISIS . 'Triple J is refusing to let me vote for Taylor Swift in the Hottest 100 I personally blame @mcscott [Scott's Twitter handle],' he wrote. To which, Scott replied: 'Shake it off Joe.' The tweet sparked a social media campaign, with fans of Swift boycotting the Australia Day tradition by voting for her songs and trending the hashtag '#Tay4hottest100'. In retaliation, extreme alternative music fans then took to social media to intimidate Taylor supporters, some with death threats. 'I hope you die a slow, painful death,' one wrote to a voter, while another compared a fan to ISIS. A Triple J spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia last week she could not comment on the movement. 'We don't comment on voting campaigns whilst Hottest 100 voting is open, as it may influence the results of the poll,' she said.

"For years, Etan Patz' parents were sure they knew who had kidnapped the first-grader on his way to school in 1979, and they devoted themselves to trying to hold him accountable. Testimony will soon start in the murder trial they so long awaited — with a different man at the defense table, a man never suspected until he gave a 2012 confession he now disavows. The trial partly reflects Stan and Julie Patz' efforts to keep the investigation going and make missing children a national priority. But it stands to be both searing and complex for the parents, who had pressed authorities to prosecute the earlier suspect — a convicted Pennsylvania child molester — and even brought their own wrongful-death suit against him. Agony: The Patz's long pursued convicted child molester Jose Antonio Ramos (left) in the disappearance of their 6-year-old son Etan. They pressed authorities to pursue charges against him and even filed their own wrongful death suit. However, now a different man--Pedro Hernandez (right)--is headed to trial in his death . 'Sometimes I think the worst thing that could happen,' Julie Patz once said, 'would be never knowing what happened to Etan.' Jury selection is underway for Pedro Hernandez' trial in one of the first missing-child cases ever featured on milk cartons. Hernandez, a former shop worker in the Patzes' neighborhood, denies the charges. His lawyers say his confessions were fiction spurred by mental illness. Horrific: Hernandez gave police a videotaped confession to luring Etan to a basement with a soda, choking him and dumping his still-living body in a box with some curbside trash . The Patzes declined to comment on the case last week. Julie Patz is expected to testify; it's not clear whether her husband will. The Patzes — he a photographer, she a day care provider, together parents of three  — became the very visible center of an exhaustive investigation after 6-year-old Etan vanished while walking two blocks to a school bus stop on May 25, 1979. Their loft in Manhattan's then-edgy SoHo neighborhood became a makeshift police command post and media center, their phone an ever-ringing hotline. Their faces were suddenly a nation's portrait of parental agony that could strike anyone. 'They were unassuming people who were living their lives, being part of their community, being friends with their neighbors, raising their children. And this happened to them,' says Lisa R. Cohen, the author of 2009's 'After Etan: The Missing Child Case That Held America Captive.' As the investigation stretched on, the Patzes grappled with police scrutiny and strangers questioning their parenting choices. A man was charged with trying to extort them by claiming he knew Etan's whereabouts. Leads sparked and fizzled. Troubled by the gaps in a then highly localized approach to missing children, the Patzes became leaders within a burgeoning movement to make them a national cause. With the parents of abducted Florida boy Adam Walsh and others, they successfully pushed for federal legislation that allowed missing-child reports to be entered into the FBI's national crime database. The date of Etan's disappearance became National Missing Children's Day. Complex case: Stan and Julie Patz went to the painful step of having Etan legally declared dead so they could sue Ramos, who's no longer a suspect the crime. They've not commented on the case against Hernandez but are likely to testify . 'His brave parents have fought to increase our awareness of this tragedy' and improve enforcement, President Ronald Reagan's 1983 proclamation said. Meanwhile, police came across a new suspect: Jose Ramos, who had dated a woman who sometimes walked Etan home from school. Ramos would later be accused of sexually assaulting boys in Pennsylvania and serve over 25 years on his convictions. And he told authorities about interacting with a boy he thought could be Etan on the day he disappeared, though Ramos said he hadn't killed the boy. He has since denied having anything to do with Etan's disappearance. The Patzes took the painful step of having Etan legally declared dead so they could sue Ramos. After he stopped cooperating with questioning, a civil court held him responsible for Etan's death. But prosecutors said there wasn't enough evidence to charge anyone. A look at the murder case stemming from the 1979 disappearance of Etan Patz, which helped catalyze a national missing-children's campaign. THE CASE . Six-year-old Etan Patz was walking to his Manhattan school bus stop alone for the first time when he vanished May 25, 1979; the anniversary is now National Missing Children's Day. His body has never been found, but his family had him legally declared dead in 2001. The investigation stretched across decades and continents before police announced that Pedro Hernandez had confessed in May 2012. He worked at a convenience store in Etan's neighborhood but was never a suspect until police got a tip shortly before his arrest. Hernandez, 54, of Maple Shade, New Jersey, has pleaded not guilty. THE PROSECUTION . Prosecutors' case appears to center on Hernandez's confessions to them and police, plus statements authorities say he made to a friend, his ex-wife and a church prayer group in the 1980s about having harmed a child in New York. The prosecution team, led by veteran Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon, hasn't alluded to any physical evidence against Hernandez, and his defense has said there is none. It recently emerged that an inmate informant will testify against Hernandez, but the person's identity and details of the prospective testimony haven't been released. In his video-recorded confessions, Hernandez tranquilly recounts offering soda to entice Etan into the convenience store basement and choking him. He says he put the still-living boy into a plastic bag, boxed up the bag and left it on a street. Prosecutors call the confessions credible, and Manhattan state Supreme Court Justice Maxwell Wiley ruled they could be used at trial. The decision followed a weekslong hearing on whether Hernandez was properly advised of his rights to stay silent and mentally capable of understanding them. THE DEFENSE . Hernandez's defense maintains his confessions are the false imaginings of a man who has an IQ in the lowest 2 percent of the population and has problems discerning reality from fiction. He has taken anti-psychotic medication for years and has been diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder, which includes the characteristics of social isolation and odd beliefs. The defense — led by Harvey Fishbein, who has handled other murder cases involving psychiatric issues — and the prosecution differ on the extent and implications of Hernandez's mental problems. The defense may ask the jury to consider that police questioned Hernandez for more than six hours before reading him his rights and turning on recorders. The defense also wants jurors to hear about longtime suspect Jose Ramos, a convicted Pennsylvania child molester. A civil court declared Ramos responsible for Etan's death after he rebuffed questioning, but he was never criminally charged and has denied involvement. Ramos has refused to testify at Hernandez's trial, saying he'd invoke his rights against self-incrimination, but some evidence about the investigation into Ramos will be allowed. WHAT'S NEXT . Jury selection continues this week. Opening statements could come the week of January 26. Enduring: People walk past a street shrine to six-year-old Etan Patz, who disappeared 33 years earlier, set in front of the building where suspect Pedro Hernandez confessed to have strangled the boy in New York on May 29, 2012 . Defense: Pedro Hernandez (R) appears with his lawyer Harvey Fishbein in Manhattan Criminal Court. Hernandez's attorneys maintain his confessions are the false imaginings of a man who has an IQ in the lowest 2 percent of the population . Stan Patz got involved in Manhattan district attorney races to make his disappointment known. Current DA Cyrus R. Vance Jr. pledged to take a fresh look at the case after he took office in 2010, and publicity about investigative efforts in 2012 helped unleash the tip that led police to Hernandez. The tipster reported that Hernandez, of Maple Shade, New Jersey, told relatives in the 1980s he'd harmed a child in New York City. Hernandez ultimately gave police a videotaped confession to luring Etan to a basement with a soda, choking him and dumping his still-living body in a box with some curbside trash. The Patzes haven't commented on the case against Hernandez. But it's created a dilemma for the lawyer who helped them sue Ramos. 'We spent many years of our lives pursuing one individual and were totally convinced that he committed the crime. It's hard after all of these years to let go of that. ... but on the other hand, you have to let it play out,' said the attorney, Brian O'Dwyer. 'This is all very strange for all of us.'","Stan and Julie Patz for years eyed convicted child molester Jose Antonio Ramos in the abduction and murder of their son in late-1970s Manhattan .

"An alien signal has been picked up by astronomers. The source of the flash of radio waves is unknown, leading to speculation that it came from a giant celestial flare, an imploding star – or maybe from an alien civilisation. The mystery signal originated up to 5.5billion light years away, far beyond the Milky Way. Alien? The mystery signal originated up to 5.5billion light years away, far beyond the Milky Way (file picture) It lasted just a fraction of a second – yet may have given off as much energy in that time as the Sun does in an entire day. A handful of these ‘fast radio bursts’ have been discovered before by sifting the through old data. Now, scientists using a giant radio telescope in New South Wales have captured one tearing through space in real time. John Mulchaey, of The Carnegie Observatories, in Pasadena, California, said: ‘These events are one of the biggest mysteries in the Universe. Until now, astronomers were not able to catch one of these events in the act.’ Development: John Mulchaey, of The Carnegie Observatories (above), in Pasadena, California, said the 'fast radio burst' events are one of the 'biggest mysteries in the Universe' Researcher Emily Petroff said: ‘For the project we had the telescope pointed at the location where one of the previous bursts from the data sets was recorded. ‘It’s so exciting to know a similar occurrence has happened in the proximity of the first. 'Fast radio bursts only last as long as it takes a human to blink their eye. That is what makes this discovery so exciting.’ Possible explanations for the phenomenon include giant flares from distant stars or imploding neutron stars – small, particularly dense stars. Some may even speculate that the signal has been beamed out by an aliens in another world. Whatever the source, identifying it is only a matter of time, The Royal Astronomical Society’s Monthly Notices says. Miss Petroff, who made the find while studying for her PhD, said: ‘We’ve set the trap. Now we just have to wait for another burst to fall into it.’","Flash could have also come from giant celestial flare or imploding star .

"There are the first pictures of a Jewish soldier's letter home written on Adolf Hitler's own personalised stationery. Danny Jacobson was a 26-year-old Army sergeant when he was among half a dozen administrative clerks from the 179th Infantry sent to occupy a Munich flat at the end of the Second World War. But this was not just any flat. It was one of the many homes used by the Hitler and his girlfriend Eva Braun, and was stocked with the Nazi Fuhrer's very own swastika-emblazoned letter paper. Irony: Danny Jacobson holds a copy of his letter written on Hitler's stationery, with a photo of himself in Army uniform. He found the stationery in an abandoned flat in Munich at the end of the Second World War . And so, on May 6, 1945, then-Sergeant Jacobson began a letter to his new wife back home in Muskogee, Oklahoma, with these words: 'Dearest Julia, . 'And so, Hitler's treasured stationery has come to this. Imaging how many times he would turn in his grave if he knew a Jew was writing on his precious personal stationery.' Mr Jacobson's 70-year-old letter, penned just six days after Hitler's suicide, is now kept for posterity in the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. The Miami Herald reports that it is now being treated by museum conservators ahead of a possible inclusion in a forthcoming exhibition of Americans in the Holocaust. Teresa Pollin, a curator at the museum, told the paper the significance of the letter is contained within its first line. 'It's quite unusual and ironic that he, being a Jewish soldier, is using Hitler's stationery,' she said. But its importance proved more difficult to prove to Mr Jacobson himself, who reportedly still can't understand why there is such a fuss about it. 'It’s just a letter. I must’ve sent 20 others on that stationery,' he told the Herald's Ana Veciana Suarez. Thankfully for posterity's sake, his son Joe Jacobson, a doctor at Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer institute, disagreed. 'I had held onto the letter for the past 20 years, pretty much out of sight all that time,' said Dr Jacobson. 'But I realised the letter was an artifact and I was afraid it would get lost somehow. 'I was nervous about holding on to it.' 'Dearest Julia': Mr Jacobson's 70-year-old letter, penned just six days after Hitler's suicide, is now kept for posterity in the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. Mr Jacobson was drafted in autumn 1940 and spent most of the war as an administrative clerk as his division fought seven major campaigns from Africa to Germany. It was the dying days of the war in Europe when he and his fellow admins were ordered to go to the block of flats in Munich, a city that had been devastated by RAF carpet bombing. He soon realised where he was, he remembered to the Herald, but did not consider it a particularly big deal. 'We were just doing our job,' he said. But it would have been an intensely personal job for Mr Jacobson, whose Jewish peers in Europe suffered mass extermination had the hands of the Nazi regime. An estimated 11million people were killed in the Nazi genocide, more than half of whom were Jews and including an estimated one million Jewish children.","Danny Jacobson found the letter-headed paper in a flat in Munich .

"Petrol will drop below £1 a litre across the country within weeks, ministers predict as they increased demands on oil companies to pass on falling prices. Treasury minister Danny Alexander told MailOnline latest falls in the global oil price should see average prices hit the £1 mark at the pumps. And he called on drivers to use their buying power to put pressure on fuel firms refusing to respond. New figures today showed the average petrol price in the last week was £1.06, the lowest since November 2009 and down 10p in just four months . New figures today showed the average petrol price in the last week was £1.06, the lowest since November 2009 and down 10p in just four months. Diesel is down to £1.14 per litre. Mr Alexander today briefed the Cabinet on the latest Treasury forecasts, and the expectation that the price will hit £1 within less than a month. While he welcomed the moves so fare from oil companies, he insisted they had still failed to pass on the full benefits of dramatic falls in the crude oil price. He told MailOnline: ‘Looking at the petrol price at the moment there is more to go. ‘This came up at Cabinet this morning. I said that within the next few weeks we should be seeing petrol down to round about £1 a litre. That is what people should be expecting and pushing for. ‘We saw the price fall again to below $50 a barrel two to three weeks ago. So there’s a six week time lag before that gets passed through at the pumps, so there should be further cuts. Treasury minister Danny Alexander today briefed the Cabinet on the latest Treasury forecasts, and the expectation that the price will hit £1 within less than a month . ‘I will certainly be pressing the fuel retailers to make sure we continue to see the pass through.’ A small number of independent petrol stations have cut the price below £1, but to date none of the major supermarkets have gone that far. Motoring groups predicted the £1 litre mark would be reached a month ago, but so far it has not happened. Mr Alexander said pressure from the government, the media and the public was working. But he ruled out a fall to as low as 90p per litre, unless there was another dramatic fall in the oi price. ‘On the basis of the oil price fall at the moment I wouldn’t see it going that far. I think if we can get to around £1 a litre that would be fair, but you know let’s see.’ In recent weeks he has written to bus companies, airlines and tour operators demanding they also reduce their prices. But bus firms in particular complain that they bought their fuel in advance to protect themselves from rising costs, and are yet to see the benefit of falls. Mr Alexander insisted the excuses were not good enough: ‘I think bus passengers are going to say well we should be seeing this passed on to us. I’m looking at the moment into is there anything more we can do in that area. ‘I’m trying to get to the bottom of what is the nature of this hedging. Clearly someone is making a lot of money out of this, I’d quite like to find out who it is and see what we can do to accelerate it. ‘When you see such a massive shift, I really do want to see that passed on to not just people who are filling up their car but people who are travelling by bus, people who are travelling by plane, people who are buying package holidays.’","EXCLUSIVE: Treasury minister tells MailOnline prices must fall further .

She will be featured on the 60 Minutes special . In extended interviews with 60 Minutes reporter Liz Hayes, the hostages are asked 'at what point did you think you could die?'. 'When he fired the first shot,' Fiona Ma answered . The Nine Network confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that 'Liz Hayes will be reporting. Many of the survivors specifically requested that she be the one to interview them and tell their story' There was industry conjecture on Tuesday that the Nine Network could roll the ratings dice and put the top rating 60 Minutes against Channel Seven's coverage of the men's tennis final at the Australian Open next Sunday . It's rumoured Nine could be paying up to $1 million for exclusive access to the stories of at least eight hostages who were kept captive for almost 17 hours in December at Martin Place . 60 Minutes has yet to announce when the program will go to air but the promotional videos are tagged 'Coming Soon'. There was industry conjecture on Tuesday that the Nine Network could roll the ratings dice and put the top rating 60 Minutes against Channel Seven's coverage of the men's tennis final at the Australian Open next Sunday. Channel Nine told Daily Mail Australia that: 'The siege story will include interviews with two staff members of the Lindt Café who were held hostage during the siege: Fiona Ma and Harriette Denny.' 'At least another six survivors will be interviewed for the story,' the network revealed to DMA. 'Liz Hayes will be reporting. Many of the survivors specifically requested that she be the one to interview them and tell their story.' Among those believed to have also been signed by Nine are Joel Herat and Jarrod Morton Hoffman, the sum total of all the interviews thought to be nudging $1 million. It's also understood that Julie Taylor, 35, the barrister at Eight Selborne Chambers who is now 23 weeks pregnant, will be featured in the 60 Minutes special. She was the hostage protected by her close friend Katrina Dawson, who died after she was hit by a bullet at the conclusion of the siege, and the one according to media analysts who has the most interesting story to tell.

Sydney siege victim Marcia Mikhael is believed to have secured a deal of at least $350,000 to tell her story to the Seven Network, as the commercial rivals opened up their cheque books to secure survivors for their respective upcoming specials. It's understood Channel Nine put in an offer of up to $300,000 for Marcia Mikhael to tell her horror story from inside the Lindt cafe on December 15th. However, Ms Mikhael, 43, who suffered shrapnel wounds to her legs, opted to go with Seven after they submitted an even bigger offer, Daily Mail Australia understand . The networks have been so desperate to snare the best stories for their head-to-head broadcasts, they have been sending out their stars to 'door knock' the 16 survivors to convince them to tell-all. One of the first to escape, John O'Brien, 83, who was seen running from the Lindt Cafe in Sydney's Martin Place with barrister Stefan Balafoutis, will also speak on the Seven program. He's rumoured to have signed on for $100,000. Meanwhile, Channel Nine's 60 Minutes special is believed to feature up to 10 survivors who escaped after being held by crazed gunman Man Haron Monis for almost 17 hours. Daily Mail Australia understands the rival specials were set to air on Sunday February 1, which is the week when the television ratings season kicks off, rather than Australia Day as has previously been claimed. This would be after the coronial inquest starts on January 29. However, confusing the matter for Seven, is the screening of the Men's Final at the Australian Tennis Open on that Sunday. Some media experts suggest that the Seven special could be screened immediately before the big match to counter any move by Nine.

"Arrested: Boxer Jermaine Taylor allegedly threatened to  shoot three children and their parents . A Little Rock woman said Tuesday that Jermain Taylor threatened to fatally shoot her 5, 3, and 1-year-old children, and that she knocked the gun away after the cursing middleweight boxing champion put the weapon to her husband's head. Toya Smith, 40, said she and her family were having a good time at the city's Martin Luther King Junior Day parade Monday when Taylor produced his boxing belt and asked to get a photo with her son. Smith says her family had never met Taylor before and that it appeared he had been drinking. 'He bent down to give my son the belt and he almost fell over and dropped the belt, and he thought my baby dropped the belt,' Smith said. She said Taylor — who already faces charges in an August shooting in Maumelle, Arkansas — produced a gun and fired two shots into the air and threatened to kill her husband. 'He put (the gun) up against his temple, I jumped in front of it and it went off up into the air,' injuring her husband's ear, Smith said. 'He was going to shoot him, but I saw it, he was going to kill him and I had to hit the gun.' Taylor's attorneys did not immediately return phone calls for comment Tuesday. A Little Rock police report says Taylor was arrested without incident and a gun was recovered. He is jailed on charges of aggravated assault, endangering the welfare of a minor and drug possession.

Along the coast, from Delaware to South Carolina, a subsea network of these colossal vehicles have become home to millions of tiny fish . 'Seeing these massive mechanisms being tossed into the ocean like a toy in the bathtub is a ping in my heart,' Mr Mallon writes. 'At first I was stunned, the moments of violent recycling, watching the water quickly adapt to its new underwater houses. 'After being pushed and stacked like a sardine in these subways cars over the past decade, it is nice to see the sardine actually getting one of these as its new steel condo.' The 'Next Stop Atlantic' project saw Mr Callon capture four 'drops' and two 'load-ups' over a period of three years.

The images show the cars being dumped into the ocean using a hydraulic lift (left) like huge anchors, churning waves in their wake . The 'Next Stop Atlantic' project saw the New York photographer capture four 'drops' and two 'load-ups' in a project spanning three years. A coral reef in Northern Australia severely damaged by warming seas has managed to completely heal itself in just 12 years, stunned researchers have found. The research in 2013 showed that an isolated reef off the northwest coast of Australia that was severely damaged by a period of warming in 1998. It was hit by coral bleaching, caused by higher water temperatures that break down the coral's symbiotic relationship with algae that provide food for coral growth. However, the team found Scott reef has regenerated in a very short time to become nearly as healthy as it was before. The discovery raises hope that other damaged reefs could 'regenerate' The 18-ton stainless steel cars - minus wheels, windows and doors - are stacked two-high on a barge where a bucket crane with a specially designed hydraulic lift picks them up one by one. The images show the cars being dumped into the ocean like huge anchors. While it may appear like an act of pollution, it is in fact the opposite. After four decades carrying millions of New Yorkers, these subway cars are now home to millions of sea life. 'The Metropolitan Transit Authority's recycling program has been involved for the past decade, retiring over 2500 subways cars to the ocean to help rebuild underwater reefs along the eastern seabed,' the New York photographer explains. 'These are my images, seconds before these mass transit vessels join history in building homes for life under the sea.' The reefs attract fish because they provide protection from predators, and generate food like mussels, shrimp and crabs that quickly colonise the structure. About 95 per cent of the seabed off the U.S. mid-Atlantic coast is naturally bare sand, which is much less likely to attract fish. Officials hope the new reefs will become home to such inshore species as black sea bass, tautog and summer flounder. These in turn should attract game like marlin, tuna and dolphin. Overall, corals are estimated to generate $200 million (£131 million) annually in the U.S. Mr Mallon's images will be on display at New York University's Kimmel Galleries from February 6th to March 15, 2015.

"Scotland’s struggling oil industry will be bailed out by the UK Government, George Osborne revealed today. The Chancellor said he had already cut taxes on North Sea oil to protect jobs in the industry, amid rapidly falling prices, but would take ‘further steps at the Budget’ in March to help. But Mr Osborne also revealed that MPs representing Scottish constituencies could be barred from voting on parts of the Budget after the election – once the Edinburgh government had been handed sweeping new powers over tax and spending. Chancellor George Osborne said he had already cut taxes on North Sea oil to protect jobs in the industry, amid rapidly falling prices . The Chancellor, appearing before MPs on the Treasury Select Committee, said the Government’s support for the North Sea oil industry was only possible because Scotland had rejected independence in last year’s referendum. He said the problems suffered by the industry ‘reminds everyone of the risk of independence’. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has revealed that an independent Scotland could have been up to £7billion worse off as a result of falling oil revenue. Mr Osborne lambasted predictions made by the SNP during the referendum campaign about the finances North Sea oil would generate for the nation as ‘wildly optimistic’. He told the Commons Treasury select committee: ‘I took decisions in the Autumn Statement to reduce taxes on North Sea oil, anticipating the pressures that the falling oil price would have on the industry and I'm sure we are going to have to take further steps at the Budget. ‘But we can only do that because we are United Kingdom and we pool our risks.’ The Institute for Fiscal Studies has revealed that an independent Scotland could have been up to £7billion worse off as a result of falling oil revenue . The energy industry is suffering a wave of job losses as oil prices continue to plummet amid increasing US production and falling demand in economically struggling countries. Mr Osborne said that while UK economic forecasts were made by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, Scotland's predictions were made by its government. He added: ‘From memory, the Scottish government forecast that they would receive £20 billion of revenues in the coming three years from oil if oil taxes were devolved. ‘I think it is going to be probably around one third of that, well, that was the most recent forecast published and, of course, the oil price has fallen further since. Mr Osborne said the problems suffered by the industry ‘reminds everyone of the risk of independence’ promoted by SNP First Minister Nicola Sturgeon (above) ‘So, they don't have a particularly great track record and, of course, if Scotland had become independent, if the people of Scotland had voted for independence, the promises that the SNP had made to the people of Scotland, they would not have been able to deliver on because they have got their wildly optimistic, and that's a polite way of putting it, forecasts about oil tax. ‘So, one of the great benefits of the United Kingdom is that we can help each other when things like the oil prices change dramatically.’ The Chancellor also confirmed that draft legislation on the devolution of extra powers to Holyrood will be published on Thursday. But he said because Edinburgh was getting sweeping new spending powers, restrictions on the voting powers of Scottish MPs would ‘have to apply on areas connected with the Budget’. In a message aimed at Ed Balls, who could find himself in No 11 Downing Street after the election as part of a Labour government relying on the support of smaller parties such as the SNP, Mr Osborne also said the chancellor after the next election should not be ‘beholden on Scottish nationalist votes’. Once powers to set income tax have been devolved, Scotland would have to ‘live with the consequences’ of its decisions - including if wealthy individuals flee across the border to escape ‘punitive’ rates, Mr Osborne told the Treasury Select Committee. Mr Osborne said proposals for ‘English votes for English laws’ would be published before the general election, but he insisted that it must be the case that Scottish MPs should have their ability to vote on aspects of future Budgets curbed if powers have been devolved. The cross-party Smith Commission on devolution said the Scottish MPs should continue to vote on the UK's Budget, including income tax. Many aspects of the system would remain UK-wide, Mr Osborne said, including the definition of income and the system of reliefs, so MPs from Scottish constituencies would be able to vote on those.","Chancellor said he had already cut taxes on North Sea oil to protect jobs .

"When it comes to getting ahead at work, it seems many women lack the confidence to ask for a pay rise or a promotion. Despite an increasing success in the corporate world, a survey has found the glass ceiling still looms with nearly a fifth of women (17 per cent) believing it's impossible for a woman to reach senior management. The research also found that more than a third (36 per cent) of women aren't climbing the career ladder because they aren't confident to ask their bosses for more. Over a third of women said their lack of confidence stopped them from asking for a promotion or pay rise . According to the study, which was carried out by O2, this lack of self-esteem is stopping women workers from asking for the promotion or pay rise they feel they deserve. Further highlighting this crisis in confidence, luck was by far the biggest reason attributed to success. Qualities such as skill, hard work, talent and ambition hardly featured in the responses of the 2,000 women polled. Management consultant, Emily, 27, who used to work in Westminster, knows how it feels to struggle with confidence. 'I only realised my confidence was holding me back when a more junior male colleague asked for a double promotion, which would have put him above me, whereas I hadn’t even thought about going for the job myself. He didn't get it, but it was a wake up call.' Despite women's increased success in the corporate world, the dreaded glass ceiling still looms with nearly a fifth of women (17 per cent) believing it's impossible for a woman to reach senior management . Emily puts her lack of self-esteem in the workplace down to the male-dominated environment she worked in: . 'Often, I would be the only woman in meetings and male colleagues would be making laddish jokes and I would be ignored and spoken over. 'I thought it meant I didn’t have a valid or valuable contribution. It drained my confidence.' In response to the findings, O2 is launching Breaking the Boardroom: A Guide For British Businesses . Despite women often displaying  self-doubt at work, they still dream big. Nearly a third of women said they aspired to be the CEO (28 per cent) or on the board of a company (35 per cent). However, when asked about their own career, a third (32 per cent) revealed that it had failed to meet their expectations. Poor quality line management (33 per cent), a lack of effective training and development programmes (22 per cent), and negative office politics (28 per cent) were the main reasons women felt hindered their progression. Half (48 per cent) of women polled also believed all the decision-makers in their company are male. In response to the findings, O2, in association with the CIPD, The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, is launching Breaking the Boardroom: A Guide For British Businesses on how to support female leaders of the future. Along with insights from 2000 working women, the guide incorporates insights from O2, the CIPD, and a coalition of contributors made up of senior businesswomen from a range of roles and industries including IT, law and engineering. The guide provides advice to businesses of all sizes looking to implement their own programmes to help women reach leadership roles. Christine O'Brien, partner at Baker & McKenzie LLP who contributed to the guide, said: 'We're dealing with a proportion of the population with a genuine disability – an acute lack of confidence. 'This is the single biggest obstacle that women face.' Ann Pickering, O2's HR director and board member, added: . 'Our research shows that, while the diversity debate has moved on outside of the office, not enough women are actually seeing this progress at work. 'If we're to achieve sustainable and long-lasting change, we can't just look at women already at the top - we need to focus our efforts on women at every level, creating a strong pipeline of female talent across British businesses.'","Survey finds striking lack of confidence in British women in the workplace .

"The number of child sex grooming cases uncovered by police has soared by a third in just a year, ministers have admitted amid warnings abuse is happening in every town in the country. The Home Office has revealed that 495 sexual grooming offences were recorded by police in the year to June, up 32 per cent on the same time in 2013. It comes as council leaders hold a summit today on how to protect youngsters from being exploited by gangs of sex offenders. Home Office Lynne Featherstone revealed that 495 sexual grooming offences were recorded by police in the year to June, up 32 per cent on the same time in 2013 . Police say they have been inundated with reports of child sexual exploitation, including historic cases and allegations of grooming and trafficking across the country. It follows high profile historical cases involving celebrities such as Jimmy Savile and revelations about sex gangs in Rotherham and Rochdale. Fleur Strong, director of Parents Against Child Sexual Exploitation (Pace), told MailOnline last month that this type of abuse is 'in every town' and warned that people retreated to a 'comfort zone' of thinking grooming and abuse only happen 'elsewhere'. Challenged about the remarks, Home Office minister Lynne Featherstone insisted the risk of child abuse and grooming was not limited to certain areas. 'We know that child sexual abuse and exploitation are not confined to any particular areas of the country,' she said in response to a parliamentary question. 'It can take on many different forms.' Revealing the sharp rise in sexual grooming offences recorded by the police in England and Wales of 32 per cent, Ms Featherstone added: 'This Government is absolutely determined that every case of child sexual abuse or exploitation is fully investigated and all perpetrators prosecuted, we will do nothing to jeopardise those aims.' Today the Local Government Association (LGA) is holding a high-level summit to examine what more can be done to tackle historic weaknesses in councils in dealing with child abuse. David Simmonds, chairman of the LGA's children and young people board, said: 'Keeping children safe is the most important thing that councils do, but we know we cannot do it alone. 'Protecting children does not fall only to councils, but to the police, health services, schools and local groups. Inspections must reflect this.' But Labour MP John Mann criticised the event, , claiming victims were being excluded from the platform at the LGA 'talking shop' in Westminster. He said: 'There has been a shameful lack of support for the survivors of child abuse. I met with a constituent last week for example who was refused support by local mental health services. 'It doesn't appear that a single representative of survivors' groups will actually be speaking at the meeting ... in London and unless they are members of the LGA it will cost them over £345 to even attend.' There has been a rise in reported cases of abuse following revelations about sex gangs in Rotherham and Rochdale (pictured) Also today experts involved in the Government's troubled child sexual abuse inquiry will appear before MPs. The inquiry set up by Home Secretary Theresa May has stalled following the resignations of the two people appointed to chair it and uncertainty about how it will be granted extra powers. Two members of the inquiry panel and the body's expert adviser Professor Alexis Jay, who wrote the damning report on sexual exploitation in Rotherham, will appear before the home affairs select committee. Fleur Strong, director of Parents Against Child Sexual Exploitation (Pace), said child abuse and grooming is happening in every part of the country . Mrs May revealed in a letter last month that she was considering standing down the panel in favour of a royal commission or a new inquiry on statutory terms. As well as Prof Jay, the MPs will hear from panel members Drusilla Sharpling and Professor Jenny Pearce as part of their investigation into the inquiry, which is without a chairman following the resignations of Baroness Butler-Sloss and Dame Fiona Woolf after each became entangled in allegations of conflict of interest. There has been a rise in reported cases of abuse following revelations about sex gangs in Rotherham and Rochdale. But campaign groups and the police warned parents and officials not to assume the problem was restricted to some areas. Parents Against Child Sexual Exploitation has warned of an increase in people using so-called 'legal highs' to groom youngsters for sex and the crime was widespread across Britain. A major problem for police and social services is that where teenagers have been groomed they are not even aware that they are being abused and often believe they are in a loving relationship. Ms Strong said last month: ‘It's a global crime so the concept of it only happening in a section of the country is wrong, it's across the whole country. This type of abuse is in every town.' She said one of the problems was that parents and other adults prefer to think that child sex abuse is not the sort of thing that happens where they live. 'We are all in a much better comfort zone if we think this type of abuse happens elsewhere and its other people who are affected and it's other people doing the crime, that there is another ring going on. 'And it's something that we need to try and change.' She said she knew of serious cases involving families in Exeter, Norfolk, East Anglia, Cumbria, the Borders and Torquay. She warned that it was wrong to think only children in major cities were at risk.","495 sexual grooming offences recorded by police in the year to June .

"ISIS militants have reportedly captured at least 15 pigeon breeders in Iraq after deciding it is against Islamic religion to keep birds. Three of those held by the group in the eastern province of Diyala have reportedly been killed, according to a security official. Abu Abdullah, a farmer, said a total of six gunmen barged into his home earlier this week and dragged away his 21-year-old son. Scroll down for video . ISIS militants have reportedly captured 15 pigeon breeders, and killed three, in the eastern province of Diyala, Iraq, after deciding bird breeding is against Islamic religion before it takes time away from worshipping Allah . Farmer Abu Abdullah said a six gunmen barged into his home earlier this week and dragged away his 21-year-old son. He said they drove his son off in a car after rounding up pigeons in the house and burning them . Mr Abdullah's son is just one of the 15 young men – all aged between 16 and 22 – who have reportedly been captured in the province for breeding birds. Pigeon breeding is a popular hobby in the region, but it is said to be frowned upon by extremist Islamist fighters because they believe it is a distraction from worshipping Allah. Mr Abdullah, 52, said he was standing beside his son when ISIS militants stormed the family home and kidnapped his son. He told NBC News: 'I asked them why and they said: ""He is not following the real Islam, he must be punished for being a pigeon breeder. This habit is taking him away from worshiping Allah."" 'I begged them again to know where are they taking him, what are they going to do to him. They said he is going to be taken to be judged according to the Islamic Sharia. 'They pushed me, and when my son tried to stop them from pushing me they beat him. Then they put him inside the car and left.' It comes after ISIS militants bound and blindfolded men before throwing them off the top of a 100ft tower block for 'homosexual crimes'. Shocking video footage showed the men falling to their death in Raqqa, Syria . A masked Islamic fighter used a handheld radio to read aloud the 'crimes' committed by the homosexual men . Video footage then showed the men being pushed off the top of the tower block and falling to their death . He said the militants also scoured the house for pigeons before rounding up the birds, dumping them in bags and burning them. Mr Abdullah added: 'We are helpless and hopeless. I know they will kill him sooner or later. 'I'm waiting for someone to tell me he was killed, and the only thing I will do is take his body and bury it.' The news comes after it was revealed that ISIS extremists executed 13 teenage boys for watching the Asian Cup football match between Iraq and Jordan last week. The young football fans had been caught watching the game on television in the Iraqi city of Mosul, which is controlled by the Islamic State. The teenagers were rounded up and publicly executed by a firing squad using machine guns, according to anti-ISIS activist group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently. ISIS now controls large swathes of Syria and Iraq, having taken over a considerable amount since last year . The small activist group said the teenagers were rounded up by militants in the Al-Yarmouk district of Mosul after 'breaking religious laws' by watching football. It came just days after ISIS released a video showing two men being thrown off the top of a tower block in Raqqa, Syria, for being gay. A masked Islamic State fighter announced the charges against the accused using a small handheld radio, before declaring them guilty of engaging in homosexual activities. He said they should be punished by death, in accordance with Islamic State's radical interpretation of Sharia law. The men were then bound and blindfolded before being pushed off the 100ft tower block to their death.","ISIS militants have reportedly captured 15 pigeon breeders in Diyala, Iraq .

"Truckloads of drinking water have been shipped to an eastern Montana city after residents started to complain that their tap water had begun to smell like diesel. The complaints followed an oil spill in the Yellowstone River last Saturday, which saw around 50,000 gallons of oil leak into the waterway from a break in a pipeline. The spill occurred about five miles upstream from Glendive, an agricultural community in east-central Montana near the North Dakota border. Crews work to contain a 50,000-gallon oil spill after a pipeline leaked along the Yellowstone River near Glendive, Montana for an hour on Saturday . Truckloads of drinking water were shipped to the city yesterday after residents complained of a foul smell coming from their tap water and tests showed traces of oil in the city's public water supplies . Initial tests of Glendive water supplies on Saturday and Sunday revealed no evidence of oil but by late Sunday, residents began complaining that the water coming from their taps had an unusual smell, officials said. Further tests to determine the scope of any contamination will be carried out with the results expected to be known in the coming days. About 6,000 people are served by the intake. Officials stressed that they were bringing in the shipments of drinking water  as a precaution and did not know yet whether there was any health threat. Still, an advisory against ingesting water from the city's treatment plant was issued late Monday. After hearing about it, Glendive resident Ed Miller, 67, picked up an extra gallon of water from the fast-dwindling supplies at a convenience store. Miller said he hadn't noticed any odors from his own tap water. But his neighbors had, and Miller said he wouldn't be drinking any city water until the advisory was lifted. Glendive City Councilman Gerald Reichert said he first noticed an odor in the water at his house Sunday night. He said it smelled like diesel fuel. Bridger Pipeline spokesman Bill Salvin said Monday that the company is confident that no more than 1,200 barrels — or roughly 50,000 gallons — of oil spilled during the hour-long breach. Clean-up workers cut holes into the ice on the Yellowstone River, hoping they can vacuum up crude as it comes down the river in the coming days. The ice has made it harder to spot any spilled oil . A warning sign shows the location of the 12-inch oil pipeline owned by Bridger Pipeline Co. Vice President Tad True said the company has taken responsibility for the clean-up . About 6,000 people are served by the water supply intake at Yellowstone River (pictured). Officials said the truckloads of water are a precaution and any threat to the public's health is still unknown . An oil sheen was seen near Sidney, almost 60 river miles downstream from Glendive, said Paul Peronard, the on-scene coordinator for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Clean-up crews trying to recover the spilled crude were hampered by ice that covered most of the river, making it hard to find the oil. Booms were being placed in areas of open water to try and trap oil. Near Crane, which is about 30 miles downstream from the spill, crews were chopping holes into the ice in hopes that they will be able to vacuum up crude as it comes down the river in coming days. 'These are horrible working conditions to try to recover oil,' Peronard said Monday. 'Normally you at least see it, but you can't see it, you can't smell it. We're going to have to hunt and peck through ice to get it out.' Bridger crews were still working on Monday to determine exactly where the breach occurred. If it happened on the bank, some of the oil may be trapped in the soil near the river. If it was beneath the river, 'then it's all in the river,' Peronard said. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock signed an executive order on Sunday declaring a state of emergency in the area. He toured the spill site Monday afternoon and said he expected Bridger to continue its clean-up efforts 'until it's cleaned up to our standards'. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock (right) toured the spill spite Monday with Paul Peronard (left), of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 'The water's a concern,' Bullock said. 'I expect Bridger to continue and provide all the resources needed' Bob Habeck (left), of the Montana Department of Environmental Quality, speaks at a city meeting to discuss concerns about drinking water supplies. The pipeline system remained shut down Monday while crews planned to pump out any remaining oil from the section where the leak occurred . 'The water's a concern,' Bullock said. 'I expect Bridger to continue and provide all the resources needed.' The Poplar Pipeline system runs from Canada to Baker, Montana, and carries crude oil from the Bakken oil-producing regions in Montana and North Dakota. The pipeline crosses the Yellowstone River near Glendive and is dug around eight feet into the river bed. The pipeline, which was last inspected in 2012, remained shut Monday while crews planned to pump out any remaining oil from the section of the pipeline where the breach occurred. Bridge Pipeline Vice President Tad True said the company apologizes for the spill and has taken responsibility for the clean-up. The company will not be able to restart the pipeline until it receives approval from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. Inspectors from the federal agency were at the spill and also planned to inspect Bridger Pipeline's control room in Casper, Wyoming, to gather more information, PHMSA spokeswoman Susan Lagana said.

"A boyfriend went out for a ride on his motorkbike to 'clear his head' after a row with his girlfriend  - and was killed in a horror smash. Steel worker Gareth Davies, 27, jumped on his powerful Kawasaki ZX motorbike and sped off after falling out with his girlfriend. An inquest heard how the last conversation he ever had with girlfriend Natalie Smith, 26, was an argument at a local pub. Steelworker Gareth Davies, pictured, died after his high-powered Kawasaki motorbike crashed in April . Mr Davies lost control of his power bike and swerved into a parked car, suffering multiple injuries. He died at the scene. He had been at the pub near his home in Aberdulais near Swansea, South Wales, when the row began. Neath Port Talbot Coroners Court heard he was seen arguing with Ms Smith as they left the pub in April last year. Mr Davies then stormed off and Ms Smith heard the sound of his motorbike speeding away into the night. The court heard that Mr Davies lost control of the bike, began to wobble, causing him veer onto the opposite side of the road. Neighbours in Cadoxton, South Wales heard a 'woosh and a bang' as he collided with a skip and then a parked black Seat Leon. Collision investigator PC Gareth Davies said the collision had caused the Seat to move seven metres, with the handbrake on. The bike and car then caught fire. Mr Davies lost control after riding through Cadoxton, South Wales, pictured on April 17, 2014 at 7pm . Mr Davies lost control of his high powered Kawasaki ZX motorbike, similar to this one . He added: 'This tells me that it was a high speed impact. 'In my opinion, excessive speed is a contributory factor in this case. Gareth made an attempt to control it. 'It looks like he acted very quickly and tried to do something about it. This all happened very, very quickly.' Assistant coroner Aled Griffith said: 'The accident was caused by Gareth losing control of his motorbike. 'It was a rash, spur of the moment decision, and it is very sad that this decision led to Gareth's death. 'This is a case where a young person has been cut down in his prime.' The coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death.","Gareth Davies had a row with his girlfriend Natalie Smith before his death .

"More details have emerged about what President Barack Obama is like behind-the-scenes ahead of the release of a tell-all memoir from the 'bodyman' who worked alongside Obama for years. Reggie Love, who worked as Obama's personal aide during the 2008 presidential campaign and during his first years in the White House, is revealing all in his book, Power Forward: My Presidential Education, which will be released early next month. Love says that the 53-year-old is very particular about his diet and his a complete health freak, but is the most pedantic about his shoes. 'Shoes were always the biggest challenge for the senator. The man was particular about his feet. He wouldn’t just throw on any old pair of mukluks. They had to look a certain way, feel a certain way. Anytime he couldn’t wear his favored dress flats, it was an issue,' Love wrote in the book, according to The New York Post. Barging in: Reggie Love, (left) Obama's former personal aide, has revealed in his memoir certain habits about the President, from his strict, healthy diet to his obsession with shoes and how he quit smoking . 'Throughout the campaign, I was always trying to scratch and scrounge to procure the ideal footwear. I’d send screen-shots to the advance teams and say, ‘Find these!’ Also, ‘Buy wool socks!’” Obama even discussed his penchant for footwear with Beyonce and Jay-Z during a meeting at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in New York. Beyonce had just finished a tour and said her feet were killing her, prompting the president to say she needed to get a foot massage from a masseuse. 'That must be in the budget for the tour production,' Obama joked. 'And Jay said, ''Yeah, so long as it isn’t a man'',’ Love wrote in his book. 'I quipped, ''You’ve seen 'Pulp Fiction. You never let another man massage your woman’s feet'', after which Jay burst out laughing.' According to Love, Obama became adamant in the diet department. Among the restrictions were: 'No gum wrapped in tiny papers. No energy bars with fruits. Salads only in emergencies. … Nothing battered or fried.' Love said Obama once picked out all the chocolate from a trail mix packet and said he refused to eat it. One time Love said he went to Wendy's for some fast food, only for Obama to say: 'That stuff will kill you.' Love asked if he could still indulge in McNuggets. 'Reggie, you won’t be young forever,' Obama quipped. Funny conversation: Former Obama 'bodyman' Reggie Love has revealed a joke Obama once shared with Beyonce and husband Jay Z (pictured together) However, during the campaign trail, Obama was forced to eat his diet stipulations - literally - while drumming up support in Iowa. Love said Obama had to bow down to a state ritual and eat a Maid-Rite lose meat sandwich - a  'heap of coarsely boiled ground beef bigger than your average Chihuahua that is served spilling out of a platter-sized, fluffy white bun'. Obama 'was aware that people in Iowa loved their loose meat sandwiches, and so it went down', Love said. 'For months after, I would tease the senator with ''Man I cannot believe you ate that sandwich''. 'And he would smile and say, ‘'Nobody can ever say I didn’t want to win''.’ On Obama's sense of humor, Love said he once joked about taking everyone out to a strip club. At the time the campaign trip had hit Las Vegas, and NBA player Charles Barkley wanted to 'hang out' 'Let’s just take tomorrow off and go to the Cheetah Club,' Obama joked to his staff, Love said. Cheetahs Las Vegas is a famous Gentleman's Club. Love developed a very personal bond with Obama. According to the Washington Post, Love recounts a moment when his professional relationship with the president turned personal. Love wrote that he was staying in a hotel during the presidential election campaign when he had a female friend to stay. The next morning Love was getting ready for the day ahead but the woman was in bed when, using the Secret Service master key, Obama opened the door, walked in, and said: 'Hey, Reggie, we need to go over the schedule.' After noticing the guest lying on the bed he said: 'Oh, I apologize' before hurrying back out. 'Bodyman': Obama reportedly referred to Love as iReggie - a reference to Love's iPad usage. The response drew a laugh from David Axelrod and Robert Gibbs, but Love had a comeback. He said: 'Actually, sir, I got way more action in college.' Love applied for an internship at the White House in 2006 after studying at Duke where he also played wide receiver for the football team. Love was appointed 'deputy political director' and Obama reportedly referred to Love as iReggie - a reference to Love's iPad usage. Love left his position at the end of 2011 to pursue an MBA. His terrified friend, with the cover pulled up to her throat, then asked: 'Was that... ?' To which Love replied: 'Senator Barack Obama.' Later in the day, the campaign team boarded a plane to their next destination and Obama started arguing with his campaign staff over their progress. To lighten the mood, Love told Obama: 'You know, sir, if it’s any consolation, I’m having the time of my life.' 'And the senator said to me, “Well, Reggie, it’s actually not a consolation to me that my campaign for president can help subsidize your love life.”' Bond: The 'bodyman' stuck with him during the 2008 presidential campaign and during his first years in the White House .","Reggie Love started working for Barack Obama when he was a senator .

More than a thousand mourners attended the funeral of RAF veteran Keith Ingham Nutbrown who died without any family or friends . Servicemen and ex-servicemen lined the entrance to the crematorium while members of the RAF performed a fly-past before the service started . Crowds of well-wishers descended on Chester Crematorium today to pay their respects at the service . Servicemen and ex-servicemen lined the entrance to the crematorium while members of the RAF performed a fly-past before the service started. So many people turned up at the funeral that some were forced to listen to the service from outside. Laurie Black, 77, who attended the short service, where Mr Ingham Nutbrown was given a full military guard of honour, said the RAF veteran was given a 'heroic send off'. He said: 'I served as a jet engine fitter in the RAF for five years so I've been a member of the RAF Association for many years. 'The chairman of the group got in touch to ask us all if we would be willing to attend the funeral after hearing Mr Nutbrown had no family or friends. 'Word soon spread and the response was absolutely astounding - there must have been more than a thousand people here. It was so busy I couldn't even get in to watch the service. Mr Ingham Nutbrown passed away at Treflys care home in Llandudno, North Wales recently and it was expected that nobody would attend his funeral . Little is known about Mr Ingham Nutbrown's life, but he is believed to have served in Ceylon, now Sri Lanka, and spent most of his life living in Shotton, Deeside . There was standing room only at the funeral as hundreds unexpectedly turned up to pay their respects to Mr Ingham Nutbrown . 'Mr Nutbrown was given a full military guard of honour and some of the tributes were very moving. 'It's such an incredible thing to see and I'm sure Mr Nutbrown would have been very proud of the send off.' Little is known about Mr Ingham Nutbrown's life, but he is believed to have served in Ceylon, now Sri Lanka, and spent most of his life living in Shotton, Deeside. The service opened with the playing of the theme tune to the film The Dam Busters while members of RAF Valley on Anglesey were among those who attended. Michael Clegg, 72, who attended the funeral, served in the RAF for 39 years and ended his career as a maritime pilot. The RAF veteran, from Ternhill, Shropshire, said: 'I was sent an email from one of my friends asking if I could attend. Servicemen lined the street on the approach to the crematorium today . The RAF Association appealed for people to attend a service in Mr Ingham Nutbrown's memory at Chester Crematorium . People came from far and wide to pay their respects - even though Mr Nutbrown was believed to have had 'no family or friends' 'I was determined to pay my respects so I travelled up from Shropshire to be here. It was a surreal experience, one I will never forget. 'I was stood in the annex of the building but there were a few hundred more stuck outside because the crematorium was packed. 'There were ex-RAF personnel along with people from the Army and the Royal Navy - the turnout was simply astonishing. 'It's incredible to think that people who didn't even know Mr Ingham Nutbrown have still turned up to show their respect. 'The vicar didn't say much about him but the notable thing was that he was said to be a very nice man who would always help others. I'm so overwhelmed to be a part of this - it was incredibly touching.'","Keith Ingham Nutbrown, 83, died at a care home in Llandudno, North Wales .

"Britain's economy grew much less than predicted last, the International Monetary Fund warned today. The global finance watchdog now thinks growth of just 2.6 per cent was achieved in 2014, compared to a previous forecast of 3.2 per cent. The IMF said that apart from in the United States, the economic performance of all major economies had fallen short of expectations. The IMF has estimated that gross domestic product in Britain grew by 2.6 per cent in 2014 compared to a previous forecast of 3.2 per cent . It also appeared to back further stimulus measures that look likely to be unveiled in the eurozone this week. The sharp downgrade comes just days after the IMF heartily endorsed Britain's economic strategy. Director Christine Lagarge said the UK was setting a global example and said in much of the world growth was 'too low, too fragile'. The IMF still expects the UK to grow by 2.7 per cent this year while it has cut its forecast for 2016 by 0.1 per cent to 2.4 per cent. Growth of 2.6 per cent in 2014 would come in ahead of major international rivals such as the US, according to the projections. But the lower than previously predicted figure comes after official UK data last month showed the economy had grown less strongly than had been thought between the third quarter of 2013 and the same period in 2014 - by 2.6 per cent rather than 3 per cent. Chancellor George Osborne said: 'Today's IMF forecast show Britain is pulling ahead, while global growth is being downgraded. There's confirmation that we grew faster than any other major economy last year, and we're set to grow faster this year. 'But there are risks out there in the global economy. It's a timely reminder of that and we've got to go on working through our long-term economic plan if we want to stay ahead.' Chancellor George Osborne said the IMF forecast shows 'Britain is pulling ahead' GDP figures for the fourth quarter completing the picture will be published next week by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). In today's report published in Beijing, the IMF said it that it had cut its forecast for global growth this year by 0.3 per cent for this year and next, to 3.5 per cent for 2015 and 3.7 per cent for 2016. It said that while the world would receive a boost from lower oil prices, this would be 'more than offset by negative factors' including investment weakness amid falling expectations about medium term growth in many advanced and developing states. The IMF said the downward revisions reflected prospects in China, Russia, the eurozone and Japan - with stagnation and low inflation a concern in the latter two. There had also been as weaker activity in some major oil exporters - with oil prices having dropped by more than half since September. The IMF said: 'The boost from lower oil prices is expected to be more than offset by an adjustment to lower medium-term growth in most major economies other than the United States.' In the UK, a new forecast by the EY ITEM Club predicts that the lower oil price will provide a 'shot in the spending arm' of consumers helping the economy to a major growth spurt this year. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said the fall in the oil price is a net positive for growth in the UK but that it will represent a 'negative shock' to the Scottish economy which relies on North Sea reserves. Oil giant BP has already announced hundreds of job cuts. The IMF report comes days before a European Central Bank meeting which is expected to see a launch of money-printing quantitative easing stimulus to try to revive the ailing single currency zone. Christine Lagarde (left), director of the international Monetary Fund, gave a glowing endorsement of the British economy on Friday . It appeared to give backing to the move, saying that while the boost to demand for struggling advanced countries was welcome, 'additional policy measures are needed in some economies'. Labour's Ed Balls said: 'It's worrying that the IMF has downgraded its forecasts for the UK economy for last year and next year too. 'In contrast the IMF says the US will grow faster than us this year and next year and has seen its growth forecasts upgraded. 'This shows why the complacency of David Cameron and George Osborne is so misplaced. Claims that the economy is fixed will ring hollow to millions of working people who are on average £1600 a year worse off under this government. 'We need stronger and more balanced growth that delivers sustained rises in living standards for all, not just a few. That's what Labour's economic plan is all about.'","International Monetary Fund downgrades growth for most economies .

"Golf's bad boy Dustin Johnson is hitting back against claims he was suspended twice for cocaine - claiming he doesn't have a drug problem. Even so, the 30-year-old jet-setter admits he partied too hard in the past and he's turning over a new leaf before his fiancée Paulina Gretzky gives birth to the couple's first child next month. Paulina revealed on Christmas Day on her Instagram that she's having a boy. Paulina Gretzky announced over Christmas that she and fiance Dustin Johnson (left) are having a baby boy . Back in action: Dustin Johnson has been on an inexplicable five-month hiatus from the PGA Tour after he was rumored to have been suspended over drug use - something he denies . Johnson gave an extended interview to Golf.com in which he admitted he's working to clean up his act and 'simplify' his life since leaving the PGA Tour five months ago. He says he's been spending a great deal of time with Paulina's father - NHL legend Wayne Gretzky - who lives just half a mile down the road from Johnson's home on the Sherwood Country Club. Gretzky has been coaching Johnson, a kid from a divorced family in South Carolina, on how to cope with his fame and fortune - he's made more than $25million off PGA Tour wins alone. Golf.com previously reported that Johnson was disciplined three times by the PGA - twice for testing positive for cocaine and once for marijuana. The site reported that he is serving a six-month suspension from the PGA Tour as a result of his last drug test. When asked about the allegations, Johnson flatly denied them. 'I did not have a problem. It’s just something I’m not going to get into. I have issues. But that’s not the issue,' he said. Paulina is due next month. The 25-year-old model has been dealing with pregnancy cravings - for celery, Johnson reveals . Paulin and Johnson made names for themselves for the jetset lifestyle and frequent social media posts . However, he admitted to drinking too much. His booze of choice - Grey Goose and soda with lime. 'I don’t miss waking up with a hangover, and I didn’t drink very often. It was just when I did it was a little too much,' he told Golf.com. The talented golfer also denied reports that he had been to rehab - saying he hired a 'life coach' and a team of clinicians to hep him 'simplify' his life. However, he said he never underwent treatment for any addiction. Johnson revealed he's abstained from booze for January - ponying up $1,000 with Wayne Gretzky and several friends from the Sherwood Country Club as part of a bet to stay off alcohol for a month. He claims he's also selling his two Jet Skis, one of his boats and his $300,000 Aston Martin. He gave his souped-up 1976 Pontiac to his brother - all in an attempt to rid himself of distractions. Johnson says he plans to end his golf hiatus and return to the PGA Tour either at Torrey Pines in La Jolla, California, on February 5, or the following week at Pebble Beach. The golf schedule depends on when Paulina gives birth. For now, he says, he's spending his time working out and taking care of Paulina's pregnancy cravings. The 25-year-old model's most common demand? Celery.","Dustin Johnson has been away from the PGA Tour for five months after he was suspended three times .

"They may have fallen by the wayside lately, in favour of tablets and phones, but experts predict sales of desktop PCs will rise again this year. And a Polish startup is hoping to aid this resurgence by developing a computer within a mouse. The mouse concept is fitted with a quad-core processor, Wi-Fi and 128GB storage - the only extra hardware needed is a monitor. Scroll down for video . The Mouse Box concept was created by Poland-based Przemysław Strzelczyk and a team of software developers. It is the same size as a traditional mouse, meaning it would fit comfortably in the hand, and runs on a 1.4GHz ARM processor, like the chip inside the Samsung Galaxy Note 10, for example . Called Mouse-Box, the wireless gadget was designed by Poland-based Przemysław Strzelczyk and a team of software developers. It is the same size as a traditional mouse, meaning it would comfortably in the hand, and runs on a 1.4GHz ARM processor, like the chip inside the Samsung Galaxy Note 10, for example. It connects to a monitor or projector via a standard HDMI cable, and comes with the same amount of storage as a high-end iPhone 6 Plus. The SONICable claims to halve the amount of time it takes to charge a battery. It is available for iPhone and Android devices. When it’s plugged into a device, but switched off, it acts like a standard USB cable and syncs content from one device to another. But, when it is switched on, the syncing functions are disabled so the cable concentrates all of its energy into charging the connected device. The £18 SONICable is set to ship in March. This can’t be physically expanded, but can be increased using cloud storage. Mouse-Box comes with built-in Wi-Fi connectivity, and charges wirelessly on an inductive charging pad that doubles up as a mouse pad. This means it should never run out of battery. ‘At the beginning, moving computers was a real challenge’ explained the Polish startup. ‘Computer portability has been improving along with developing a PC. ‘However, it still isn’t ideal as it is necessary to transport a lot of its parts - a monitor, a keyboard, a CPU and a mouse. 'We are introducing Mouse-Box, a computer different than ever before - an incredible combination of the two most important elements in a computer set.’ Mouse-Box (pictured) connects to a monitor or projector via a standard HDMI cable, and comes with the same amount of storage as a high-end iPhone 6 Plus. It charges wirelessly on an inductive charging pad that doubles up as a mouse pad. This means it should never run out of battery . In a video, the Mouse-Box is shown being used to make presentations, as an alternative to the work PC, or to replace a PC at home. The startup is currently looking for funding to create a prototype, and later put the device into mass production, so a release date and price have not been announced. Global shipments of PCs rose by one per cent in the last quarter of 2014, and analysts from Gartner believe they will continue to rise in 2015. They predict that this year, shipments will climb to almost 317 million units, up  2.9 per cent from 2014 - almost matching the number of units shipped in 2013. They also predict that tablet sales will decline as a result.

"Taya Kyle, the widow of Chris Kyle, who has paid an emotional tribute to her husband following the success of the film American Sniper . The widow of Chris Kyle whose story has inspired the box office hit American Sniper has paid tribute to audiences who have flocked to cinemas to watch the film. Taya Kyle has thanked movie-goers for 'being willing to watch the hard stuff' in the war drama, which sees Bradley Cooper play her late husband and says she often cries thinking about the support she has received. It comes after it was revealed the movie, which has been directed by Clint Eastwood, has already earned $90.2million and set a record for the highest-earning January opening. The film tells the story of Mr Kyle, a sniper, who was credited with saving hundreds of American lives by making 160 confirmed kills, which is the most in American military history. However, after retiring from the military, he was shot dead in 2013 by a soldier he was trying to help who was suffering from severe post-traumatic stress. And now with the film of his life tipped for Oscar success, Mrs Kyle, who is played by Sienna Miller in the movie, has thanked audiences in a post on Facebook. She wrote: 'I am overwhelmed with gratitude and my heart is full. American Sniper has broken records, which follows such an honest path of Chris's life. 'We never expected anything and were always in a moment of stunned silence at the response from all the beautiful people in this world. 'I also just want to cry and cry and honestly have today. I think that's what happens when I don't have the words. The only thing I can say is thank you. Thank you for the love and support of our military. 'Thank you for being willing to watch the hard stuff and thank you for hearing, seeing, experiencing the life of our military and first responders. 'I put them together because the battlefields may be different but the experience is the same on many spiritual levels.' The film, which is based on Mr Kyle’s autobiography of the same name reveals not only how he became so successful, but also how the trauma of fighting in Iraq never left him. In the post she also gave an emotional tribute to her late husband and admitted that she still misses him every day. She added: 'To Chris: I miss you and yet I know you are here. 'You are the man who I couldn't have even dreamt of because you were/are better than I could have dreamed, the love of my life, my friend, partner and the man who laughed with me through the pain and found joy in the smallest and best parts of life. 'I hope you see the love and good we will do together in whatever God has planned for the rest of the journey. Thank you for loving me. 'You are with me and I love you is all I can say. I can only say it simply, because there aren't words enough to express it all.' Mrs Kyle with her husband Chris, left, and with Bradley Cooper, right, at the premiere of American Sniper. Cooper plays Kyle in the movie, which has been tipped for Oscar success . Chris Kyle, who was credited with saving hundreds of American lives by making 160 confirmed kills, which is the most in American military history, before his death in 2013 . The film tells the story of her husband who was raised in rural Texas and started out working as a cowboy. He applied to join the SEALs but was turned down because a rodeo accident had left him with metal pins in his arms. However, in the late nineties, the unit relaxed its entrance requirements and Kyle was put through the fearsomely tough selection and training regime. In 2003, he was deployed to Iraq where he made his first long-distance kills even though he had not been trained as sniper. Spotting his obvious talent, the military sent him to SEAL sniper school, where he was taught how to perform warfare’s loneliest and most controversial job. In 2004, Kyle was posted to Fallujah, west of Baghdad and a major battleground of Iraqi insurgency, and it was during the battle for that city where he first made his mark. However, it was in 2006 in Ramadi, a city in central Iraq, that Mr Kyle gained his nickname as ‘The Legend’ from his fellow SEALs. One day, while positioned on a roof, Kyle watched a moped coming down a street. Riding it were two men, one of whom dropped a backpack into a pothole. The actor Bradley Cooper plays Mr Kyle in the film American Sniper, and has earned an Oscar nomination for best actor .

Realising that it contained an improvised explosive, Kyle took a shot at the speeding moped from a range of 150 yards. The bullet hit one of the riders, passed through him, and hit the other. In 2009, after four tours of Iraq, Kyle retired. He had not only shot more of the enemy than any other American sniper but had also gained himself a chestful of medals, including three Silver Stars for gallantry. In February 2013 he and a friend, Chad Littlefield, took 25-year old Eddie Ray Routh to a remote shooting range in Glen Rose, Texas. Before they reached the range Routh, 25, shot both men dead and stole Kyle's customized pick up truck. Routh's family claimed he was suffering from PTSD and had mental issues. His trial on two murder charges begins next February.","Taya Kyle, widow of Chris Kyle, has paid a moving tribute to her husband .

"Glamour model Julia Martinez fraudulently claimed more than £44,000 in benefits over a three year period . A glamour model who starred in a Playboy DVD has walked free from court after fraudulently claiming more than £44,000 in benefits. Julia Martinez, 43,  received £27,908.67 in income support, a further £14,112 in disability payments and council tax relief of £2,178.63. Ms Martinez, from Cheltenham, pleaded guilty to five charges for falsely claiming benefits over a three year period. A further two charges remain no file. Appearing at Bristol Crown Court, Ms Martinez received a nine-month jail sentence which was suspended for a year. However, she will have to reappear on June 26 where she will hear how much money she has to repay the state under the terms of the Proceeds of Crime Act. Ms Martinez submitted the benefits claim after she told officials that she was unable to work. She appeared at an earlier court hearing in a wheelchair while using a neck brace. The court heard that Ms Martinez has a successful acting, modelling and photographic career and used an alias to send money to Spain in a bid to avoid detection. In total, Ms Martinez received £44,199.30 in fraudulent payments. George Threlfall, prosecuting, said Martinez 'loved money, whether earned or received through benefits.' He told the court: 'Her diary is a fascinating insight into someone who was clearly obsessed by money, making it both honestly and dishonestly. 'She said the benefit system was 'fair game.' Miss Martinez has done her best to cover her tracks, by using aliases and transferring money from the UK to Spain. 'She works as a model or as a photographer. She had her own businesses, one of which was called Shoot the Bride. 'There was a sister company called Shoot the Moon. 'We also seized a DVD. It was clear she had acted in a Playboy DVD.' Bristol Crown Court heard that Ms Martinez, pictured,  is an actor, model and photographer . He said she wrote that she was very lucky, owned her own house, was slim and attractive, had a lovely dog and 'a benefit system that allows me to live comfortably'.

He said she wrote that she was very lucky, owned her own house, was slim and attractive, had a lovely dog and 'a benefit system that allows me to live comfortably'. Rob Lancaster, defending, said Martinez had a history of mental health problems and was trying to get away from an abusive and horrid past. 'Miss Martinez has suffered serious depression since her 20s, long before she made her first claim,' be said. 'She was trying to take steps to move forward with her life. These steps should have been disclosed. 'The fact is that she was someone trying to get away from benefits, not live a life on them.' Mr Lancaster told the court that when she was told she couldn't have children in 2005, it hit her hard, with Martinez reaching her lowest point in 2008. 'She suffered abuse as a child - both physically and mentally. She is a lady who has always sought the help of others to improve herself. 'Her life goal was to have children. ' Martinez admitted one count of making false representations when claiming income support and one count of failing to update the DWP on her change of situation. She also pleaded guilty to one count of falsely claiming disability allowance and two counts of claiming she was entitled to council tax relief. Judge William Hart sentenced her to a nine-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months. Martinez may have to pay a fine, but that will be dealt with at a confiscation hearing in June. Judge Hart said: 'The view the Crown takes of you and the view your friends, family and defence also have, is like two different people being spoken of. 'That often happens in a fraud case - the Crown sees someone who has cheated the system. The defence see the reason someone finds themselves in that position. 'It often lies somewhere between those extremes.'

"A man suspected of murdering a woman in a Cardiff hotel room has been arrested by police in Tanzania. Sammy Almahri, 44, from New York, has been wanted since the discovery of 28-year-old Nadine Aburas's body at the Future Inn, Cardiff Bay, on New Year's Eve. South Wales Police confirmed Almahri had been detained following an international manhunt. Sammy Almahri (pictured), 44, from New York, has been wanted since the discovery of 28-year-old Nadine Aburas's body in Cardiff . Detective Superintendent Paul Hurley said: 'Almahri fled to Tanzania and we have worked closely with the local police authorities to trace and arrest him. 'This has been a fast moving and complex investigation involving law enforcement agencies from three continents and we are particularly grateful for the professional cooperation we have received from the Tanzanian police. 'Officers from South Wales Police major crime unit were sent to Tanzania to work with local police officers and were able to trace Almahri's movements over hundreds of kilometres across the country.' Miss Aburas had travelled to New York for a holiday with Almahri in the past, but it was believed to be the first time that he had met her in Britain. It is thought he flew into the UK on Boxing Day and booked a £135-a-night room at the Future Inn hotel for December 30 and New Year's Eve. He checked into the hotel with Miss Aburas, which is less than a mile away from her flat at 8.25pm on December 30. The pair went out for an hour before returning at about 11pm. Miss Aburas (pictured) had travelled to New York for a holiday with Almahri in the past, but the visit last year was believed to be the first time that he had met her in Britain . The body of Ms Aburas was found at the Future Inn (pictured), Cardiff Bay, on New Year's Eve . But police say Almahri left at 3am on New Year's Eve and hours later at around noon, the injured body of Miss Aburas was found by hotel staff. Detectives then discovered Almahri had quickly booked a flight and flew from Heathrow to Bahrain at 10.30am on New Year's Eve. He then went to Doha in Qatar before moving on to Tanzania. South Wales Police said they couldn't say where Almahri was arrested in the vast East African country - which cover 365,756 square miles - but said the wealthy New York City resident had not been hiding in the capital city of Dodoma. The spokesman said: 'As I understand it he wasn't arrested in the capital city but somewhere else in the country.' The spokesman added: 'The next step is extraditing Sammy Almahri from Tanzania and getting him back in the UK. 'We are currently applying for extradition. A decision on charges will then be made after that - we are taking this step by step.'

"Sir John Major insisted Ukip's enthusiasm for leaving the EU is not shared by the majority of people . Ukip's enthusiasm for leaving the EU is not shared by the majority of the British population, Sir John Major has claimed. The former Tory Prime Minister insisted each generation of Britons is 'more European' than the last, and warned if the UK severs ties with Brussels it will 'lose some of its influence and power'. It came as Lib Dem Vince Cable warned the Tory referendum on Britain's membership of the EU was 'dangerous' and 'utterly unrealistic'. David Cameron has promised that if he is Prime Minister after the election he will renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU before holding an in-out referendum by 2017. He has made clear that he thinks his plan will succeed, and he will then recommend staying in the EU. If he fails he admits he will 'rule nothing out', raising the prospect that he will recommend exit from the 28-nation bloc. Sir John, who has been tipped to play a key role in the negotiations, insisted Euroscepticism 'fades with each generation' and predicts Britain will vote to stay in the EU. He told the European magazine, he said: 'A UK outside of the EU will lose some of its influence and power. 'That case must be used to recapture the hearts and minds of the British people. And it is a much more attractive case than the negativism of anti-European sentiment. So I'm not worried. 'There has always been a minority of the population who emotionally regard themselves as being British but not European. But this feeling fades with each generation. 'Each successive generation regards itself as more European than its predecessor. Whereas my generation put on its knapsack and went to Brighton for the weekend, the modern generation puts on its knapsack and goes around the world.' He also dismissed Ukip for failing to resonate with voters. 'Make no mistake: UKIP does not represent the majority of the British population. 'Present the people with the broader arguments and they will be persuaded that staying within the EU is in our best interest. 'But we have to have some indication that Britain and Europe can find agreement on difficult issues and that's what the renegotiations are going to be all about.' David Cameron has promised an in-out referendum if he is still Prime Minister in 2017, but Vince Cable warned he will achieve little and risk investment in the UK . Mr Cameron has insisted that the promise of a referendum will be a red line in any future coalition negotiation. His demands on welfare reform include banning EU nationals from claiming in-work benefits or social housing in Britain for four years, deporting jobless migrants if they do not get work for six months and refusing to allow other countries to join the EU without imposing controls on the movement of their workers until their economies have reached UK levels. He also wants tougher rules on deporting foreign criminals and the right to refuse to allow other countries to join the EU without imposing controls on the movement of their workers until their economies have reached UK levels. The Lib Dems have refused to back the idea of a vote, insisting the Tories have set an artificial timetable. In a speech in Brussels today, Mr Cable warned the Tory approach is 'actually quite dangerous'. He said: 'It is assuming that the other 27 countries will magically agree to British requests. It is raising expectations that changes can be achieved within the EU that will be very difficult to deliver. 'We do not think that a referendum is sensible or helpful in anyway. Precipitating a referendum in current conditions, holding out the prospect of major reforms that aren't going to be achieved is dangerous.'","Sir John Major insists most people do not agree with anti-EU views of Ukip .

"Mia Farrow has been ridiculed after posting a birthday message to one of her daughters – with a picture of her beneath the search term ‘Mia Farrow and her black children’. The photograph was of Quincy Farrow, who’s just turned 21, and was quickly replaced by a new photograph with the search term removed. However, Twitter users had already taken a screen shot of the gaffe. Scroll down for video . Mia Farrow has been ridiculed after posting a birthday message to one of her daughters – with a picture of her beneath the search term ‘Mia Farrow and her black children’ The actress later reposted the picture  - and claimed that it was an image she'd taken herself that had been sent to her along with the unfortunate search term . Nick Carbone tweeted the picture with the message: ‘You’d think Mia Farrow would have a photo of her daughter without having to Google it… with such an awkward search.’ The 69-year-old actress has 15 children – four from husbands Andre Previn and Woody Allen and 11 adopted, and quickly denied that she finds photographs of her loved ones by using internet searches. She claims that the picture in question was one she took – but that the one she posted was sent to her  and she used that in her Twitter feed, according to the New York Observer. She wrote: ‘I took the photo myself & posted it before. Then someone sent it to me & I didn't check source.’ Mia with her daughter Quincy in 2011 at a gala honoring the actress that was held in Pennsylvania . Ronan Farrow last year described on the Late Show with Jimmy Fallon what it was like growing up with 12 siblings. 'I had siblings from South Asia, from East Asia, from depressed communities around America, and you know, we'd have long conversations,' Farrow recalled. The young TV presenter shared an amusing anecdote involving Quincy and another who is blind. 'My sister Quincy, who is black, would get called the N-word at school and we'd talk for hours, and my sister Frankie, who's blind, would chime in an hour into conversation about race, ""Wait, Quincy's black?""' Farrow recounted to peals of laughter from the audience. ‘Still haven't told her what color I am.' Mia's 12-year-relationship with Allen ended when she discovered he'd begun a relationship with her adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn, whom he married in 1997. Mia recently won praise for her Broadway role in Love Letters, which closed in December. She wowed the critics with her moving turn in the bittersweet play by A.R. Gurney that follows two main characters, Melissa and Andrew, as they read aloud letters spanning from childhood to adulthood.","A picture of Mia Farrow's daughter was posted with a birthday message .

"He may have been judged a significant enough political figure to warrant a federal holiday - but some Americans seem not even to know Martin Luther King Jr is dead. A string of pedestrians tracked down on a California street on Martin Luther King day Monday claimed they had seen seen a speech they were told the civil rights leader gave that morning in Washington, D.C. Speaking to a cameraman for Jimmy Kimmel Live, seven of fourteen people who were asked whether they saw the supposed speech - despite King having been assassinated 46 years ago. One seemed to keep believing in the bogus speech, even when they were asked their opinion on Beyoncé and Jay Z having performed as backing singers during the address. A man who gave his name as Kenny Pattison, from Birkbeck, California, bluffed his way through questions about the speech, which he said was 'very inspiring, motivational' and 'current for today'. Another young man, who did not give his name but wore a blue cap and grey shirt, said he was 'shocked' at the appearance - but did not question whether it happened. He was given several prompts to remember that there was no way he could have given a speech. Maybe they were dreaming? These two men were keen to discuss the speech - which did not actually happen. The person on the left suggested King could do with losing weight, while the man to the right described Jay Z and Beyoncé's in the event involvement as 'fabulous' How it was: Pictured above is the famous 'I Have a Dream' speech King gave, in real life, in August 1963 . But while he said he was 'shocked' to supposedly see King in person at the U.S. Capitol, and admitted he hadn't 'heard him talk in a while', he never suggested it might be because he is deceased. Another responded to suggestions and said the American hero, who had parades processing in his honor that very moment, could do with losing some weight. Introducing the segment, which aired on ABC, a bemused Kimmel said the lack of knowledge on show was 'disturbing'. He said that sometimes such videos - where they attempt to fool passers-by into saying something obviously ridiculous - often take the best part of a day to film, but this one took hardly any time. Memorial: While Kimmel's ABC show was filming the embarrassing segment, political leaders were honoring King's memory.

"Senior Constable, Justice and Corporal are names reserved for positions of authority and rank. But bizarrely, a number of parents have tried to use them as unique names for their beloved newborn babies. The names were among those rejected in 2014 and join a list of knocked back baby titles including Christ, Lucifer, Royal-Rule, Prince, Princess and Majesty. Scroll down for video . Senior Constable, Justice and Corporal are among the bizarre names parents have tried to unsucessfully name their children in 2014 . The New Zealand Department of Internal Affairs rejected several names last year that included rank or royal connotations. But parents who also tried to enter the forward-slash symbol, 3rd and 09 when they registered their child's name were also turned down. There was one rejection of Senior Constable as a name, one rejection of Corporal, six rejections of Justice and one rejection each of Justyce and Justis. There was one attempt to name a child Christ. Under New Zealand law names can be rejected for a limited number of reasons, including that they are unreasonably long, resemble a title or rank, or may be offensive. Back in 2008, a nine-year-old girl at the centre of a custody battle was told she should become a ward of the court until she could choose a name she liked. Parents who also tried to enter the forward-slash symbol, 3rd and 09 when they registered their child's name were also informed they had been rejected . Her parents had called her Talula Does The Hula From Hawaii. Family Court Judge Rob Murfitt said at the time: 'The court is profoundly concerned about the very poor judgment which this child's parents have shown in choosing this name. It makes a fool of the child and sets her up with a social disability and handicap, unnecessarily.' Murfitt cited a list of unfortunate names that he said were embarrassing or made children seem foolish among their peers. Some names, including Fish and Chips (twins), Yeah Detroit, Stallion, Twisty Poi, Keenan Got Lucy and Sex Fruit, were blocked by registration officials, he said.","Parents have tried to use ranks and positions of authority as baby names .

"The number of vulnerable older people getting help to live in their own homes has dropped by a third over the past five years, according to a charity’s analysis yesterday. The number of people getting help with getting up, getting dressed, washing, and with meals or shopping has fallen to just 371,000, down by more than 170,000 since 2010, Age UK said. It blamed a squeeze on state-funded social care at a time when numbers of older people who need help are rising. The number of vulnerable older people getting help to live in their own homes has dropped by a third over the past five years, according to a charity’s analysis yesterday (stock image) The charity said there are now 900,000 over-65s who need care of some kind at their home but who do not get it. The report follows years of increasing concern over the way local councils have been withdrawing home help from all elderly people except those with the most limiting disabilities and illnesses, leaving hundreds of thousands without help. Middle class elderly people have been particularly badly affected, because those with savings or property worth over a means test threshold, usually £23,250, are left not only without state help but without advice on how to buy their own. People who do get care at home are often subject to 15-minute rules which often give visiting care workers too little time to do their job, or talk to the person they are helping. A series of inquiries into the way state help is delivered to vulnerable older people have found that billions more taxpayers’ money should be spent. In 2006 Sir Derek Wanless said spending should be trebled to £30 billion a year, and a review for the King’s Fund by economist Kate Barker last year found similar sums were necessary. Age UK’s Charity Director Caroline Abrahams said: ‘This devastating scorecard speaks for itself and it lays bare the fact that our state-funded social care system is in calamitous, quite rapid decline. There are now 900,000 over-65s who need care of some kind at their home but who do not get it (stock image) 'The more preventive services like meals on wheels and day care are being especially hard hit, leaving the system increasingly the preserve of older people in the most acute need, storing up big problems for the future.’ The charity said that just under a third of the older people who have difficulties carrying out everyday activities get no help from outside carers. Among them, it counted half of those who struggle to wash or get in the bath – 500,000 people; a third of those who find it hard to get out of bed – 190,000 people; and two in five of those who have difficulty getting dressed – 590,000 people. It also said there was no outside help for two thirds of those who find it hard to eat – 160,000 people; four fifths of those who need help taking medication – 200,000 people; and one in three of those who have difficulty using the toilet – 120,000 people. The charity said the number of people receiving personal home care has dropped to 370,630 from 542,965 between the 2010/11 financial year, which marked the coming to power of David Cameron’s Coalition, and the 2013/14 year, a fall of 31.7 per cent. Those receiving meals on wheels dropped even more sharply, by 63 per cent, from 81,460 to 29,560. According to the report, in 2005 more than 15 per cent of people over 65 received social care of some kind, but that dropped to 12 per cent by 2010. It is currently nine per cent. Miss Abrahams said: ‘Hundreds of thousands of older people who need social care are being left high and dry. The lucky ones have sufficient funds to buy in some support, or can rely on the goodwill of family, neighbours and friends. But there are many who are being left to struggle on entirely alone. ‘Many hospitals are finding it hard to discharge older people and commentators are asking why this challenge seems to be growing, year on year. A big part of the explanation is revealed by this scorecard: the marked decline in central Government funding for social care and the resultant reduction in support for older people to live independently at home – this at the same time as their numbers are rising. ‘Policymakers owe it to the public, older people especially, to confront the crisis in social care and its consequences.' The Department of Health blamed councils for failing to provide enough support for the vulnerable elderly. A spokesman said: ‘We have given an extra £1.1 billion to councils to help protect social care services this year on top of additional funding in recent years but ultimately they are responsible for deciding how to spend their budgets. ‘We know we need to work differently to respond to our growing ageing population - our Care Act and £5.3 billion Better Care Fund, the biggest ever national programme to join up health and social care, will focus resources on helping people to live independently, which will save money and reduce unnecessary hospital admissions.’ Officials suggested there was ‘significant scope’ for councils to make savings by reducing £2 billion a year of uncollected council tax , £2 billion lost from Housing Benefit and other fraud, and £19 billion held in reserves.","The number of people getting help has dropped by 170,000 since 2010 .

"Three Republican lawmakers - House Speaker John Boehner, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Florida Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen - are bringing Cuban dissidents as their guests to the State of the Union tonight as a symbol of their opposition to President Barack Obama's new Cuba policy. Boehner will host Jorge 'Antúnez' Luis García Pérez, a former political prisoner of Fidel Castro who the Ohio Republican's office says was imprisoned for 17 years for denouncing the then-Cuban president's 'oppressive' regime, and his wife, Yris Tamara Pérez Aguilera, founder of the Rosa Parks Feminine Civic Rights Movement. Pérez and Aguilera are 'leading the fight for freedom and human rights in Cuba' against the Raul Castro regime, Boehner's office said in a statement. Jorge 'Antúnez' Luis Garcia Perez, left, and his wife Yris Tamara Pérez Aguilera, right, are human rights and democracy activists in Cuba. Antúnez was jailed for 17 years from 1990 to 2007 in Cuba under the Raul Castro regime. House Speaker John Boehner is bringing both Perez and his wife to the State of the Union tonight as his guests . Rosa Maria Paya is pictured here in 2013. She is the daughter of the late Cuban activist Oswaldo Payá. Her father died in a car accident in Cuba in 2012 that the driver of the vehicle alleges was no accident at all was instead the work of the Cuban government.  Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is bringing her to tonight's speech . Rubio said Monday that he had invited Rosa María Payá, daughter of the late Cuban activist Oswaldo Payá. Paya's father died in a car accident in Cuba in 2012 that the driver of the vehicle alleges was no accident at all was instead the work of the Cuban government. 'For years, Oswaldo Payá courageously traveled throughout Cuba collecting tens of thousands of signatures from ordinary Cubans on a petition that came to be known as the Varela Project, which sought a peaceful democratic transition. All Oswaldo Payá wanted was a better future for Cuba and the Cuban people, and the Castro regime assassinated him for it,' Rubio said in a statement. 'Since her father’s murder,' Rubio said, 'Rosa María has honored his legacy by continuing to advocate for a free and democratic Cuba and also fighting to bring his murderers to justice.' Ros-Lehtinen is taking Marlene Alejandre Triana, the daughter of late Brothers to the Rescue pilot Armando Alejandre Jr., as her guest. Triana's father was murdered by the Castro regime in 1996. As part of the prisoner swap that freed American aid worker Alan Gross - who is coming to tonight's address as a guest of President Obama tonight - Obama commuted the sentence of one of the Cuban spies Ros-Lehtinen said today 'was one of the co-conspirators' in the plot to shoot down Triana's father's plane. Obama will spend a few moments of his speech this evening boasting about his administration's secret talks with Cuba throughout 2014 that led to an announcement last month that the U.S. would resume diplomatic relations with the Communist country after more than 50 years of hostilities. Following Cuba's release of 53 political prisoners whose freedom the U.S. demanded,  Obama last week issued a memorandum easing restrictions on travel to the country. No longer will Americans have to apply for a special government license to visit Cuba for educational purposes, to see family or a handful of other reasons. They still won't be able to go to the country strictly for vacation, though. And Americans who do travel to Cuba will now be able to bring back $100 of alcohol and cigars. A full lifting on trade and travel embargoes on the country must come from Congress, though, and a bipartisan block of lawmakers have vowed to make sure that doesn't happen. Marlene Alejandre-Triana, center, fights back tears as speaks during a news conference on Dec. 17 after President Barack Obama announced that he had secretly arranged prisoner exchanges with Cuban leader Raul Castro as part of an effort to normalize relations. Alejandre-Triana's father Armando Alejandre was one of four victims of a 1996 Brothers to the Rescue assassination after his plane was shot down by the Cuban military. She's coming tonight with Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen . Over the holiday weekend group of federal lawmakers, led by Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy, met in Havana with Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez and other members of the country's government. Next week Assistant Secretary of State Roberta Jacobson will travel to Cuba to negotiate the opening of a U.S. Embassy there. Appearing on Jose Diaz-Balart's show this morning on MSNBC, Ros-Lehtinen said she 'would like nothing more' than to 'get the Cuba people....free elections' and a multi-party system of governing. But the deal negotiated by the Obama administration 'is not gonna get us there,' she said. 'It's a good deal for American tourists, maybe, who want cheaper rum and cheaper cigars, and maybe that's what's driving this conversation,' she said. 'But I think it's about freedom, it's about respect for human rights, and the president is not going to help the Cuban people get there.' 'We've given away the store, and I don't think the Cuban people are going to be any freer today or tomorrow with this very weak Cuba deal,' Ros-Lehtinen told him. The Cuban military runs the tourist bureau there, she explained, so the U.S. is just 'feeding the monster that then oppresses the people' when it encourages unrestricted trade and travel with the country. Rubio said in a statement on Monday that the detente was only 'giving the regime legitimacy and greater access to American dollars it will use to fund its machine of repression – the very machine that harassed Oswaldo Payá for years, eventually murdered him and pays hush money to potential key witnesses.' The GOP senator, whose parents were Cuban immigrants, said he hoped Rosa María presence at the State of the Union would 'at least remind [Obama] that her father’s murderers have not been brought to justice, and that the U.S. is now, in fact, sitting at the table with them.'

"Danny Alexander warns of an ‘explosion of aggressive advertising’ during sporting events televised before the 9pm watershed . Aggressive television adverts for casinos and betting websites must be reined in because it is ‘almost impossible’ to prevent children seeing them, a senior minister warns. Cabinet correspondence leaked to the Daily Mail reveals a growing Coalition row over whether to reverse Labour’s controversial decision to lift restrictions on gaming commercials. As research suggests children as young as four are exposed to gambling adverts more than 200 times a year, Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander warns of an ‘explosion of aggressive advertising’ during sporting events televised before the 9pm watershed. In a letter to Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, Mr Alexander complains that a review of gambling advertising being conducted for ministers ‘has still not reported’. ‘This is a matter of principle, and I believe the time to act is now,’ the Liberal Democrat minister insists. The Mail highlighted warnings from doctors and Church leaders when the last Labour government allowed unlimited numbers of gambling adverts for TV in 2007. It allowed them to be screened during any programming after the 9pm watershed, and at any time of day during major sporting events. The Royal College of Psychiatrists warned there was clear evidence that advertising would lead to more problem gambling. As a result of Labour’s reforms, there has been a 1,500 per cent increase in gambling commercials, which now make up 4 per cent of all advertising. Campaigners say schedules have been flooded with aggressive commercials for bingo, online gambling sites and sports betting which give the impression that children and vulnerable people are being encouraged to see gambling as a fun, everyday activity. However, the Culture, Media and Sport department is resistant to change, according to government sources. Criticised: Viewers are tempted by celebrity names such as Bet365’s Ray Winstone to bet on everything from the time of the first goal to the number of corners in a football match . In his letter to Mr Javid, Mr Alexander writes: ‘I am growing increasingly concerned by the prevalence of betting advertising during televised sporting events that are watched by children. ‘It has now become almost impossible to watch any kind of sports event without being bombarded by highly solicitous advertising. The decision by the previous government to allow betting companies to advertise during sports events before the watershed is completely anomalous. It was, of course, part of a grubby deal cooked up by the last Labour government.’ The Mail highlighted warnings when the last Labour government allowed unlimited numbers of gambling adverts for TV in 2007 . The Chief Secretary said people who wanted to gamble ‘have every right to do so’, but added: ‘Many parents enjoy sitting down with their children to watch a big sports event. I suspect very few now consider what is advertised during the breaks acceptable.’ A review of gambling advertising was due to report last year, but has still not been published. Experts are due to make recommendations on any changes needed to the industry’s voluntary code, including on the suitability of the 9pm watershed arrangements. They are also assessing the latest evidence on the link between advertising and gambling addiction, to determine if a broader crackdown is necessary. Lib Dem MP Tessa Munt is calling for a change in the law to stop the ‘insidious’ rise in gaming commercials. ‘They make gambling seem normal,’ she said. ‘Adverts portray gambling as a glamorous pursuit and a quick and easy way to make money. However, the reality is often very different – with addiction and debt having a devastating impact on individuals and families.’ The latest adverts trade on the concept of people betting ‘in play’. Viewers are tempted by celebrity names such as Bet365’s Ray Winstone to bet on everything from the time of the first goal to the number of corners in a football match. William Hill, Ladbrokes, Paddy Power and Coral recently agreed to impose a voluntary ban on TV adverts offering free bets before 9pm.","Adverts for casinos and betting websites must be reined in, minister warns .

"He's famous for championing the environment but Prince Charles is yet to add an electric car to the royal fleet - until now. Visiting the Nissan UK car plant in Sunderland, the Prince of Wales, who is currently staying at his Scottish home, Birkhall, was offered the chance to sit in one of the vehicles. And despite the presence of a large audience of workers armed with smartphones, the 66-year-old gamely strapped himself in. New addition: Prince Charles was on cheerful form as he hopped into the driving seat of an electric car . Charles was undertaking his first engagement of the year following an extended holiday spent at Birkhall, which sits on the Balmoral Estate, with his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall. The couple, who are known as the Duke and Duchess of Rothesay north of the border, spent Christmas with the Queen at Sandringham but travelled to Scotland almost immediately afterwards. Charles' visit to Sunderland comes in the wake of a difficult few weeks for the royal family, which was shaken by allegations of sex abuse made about Prince Andrew and a furore over a BBC documentary about Charles. The documentary, Reinventing the Royals, should have been aired on the 28th December but was shelved after Clarence House declined to release archive footage of Charles and his sons William and Harry. How does this work then? Charles had to concentrate as he was told how to turn the all-electric car on . Audience: Charles' exploits were watched by an audience of factory workers, all armed with smartphones . Environmentalist: Charles' visit touched on one of his favourite topics, safeguarding the environment . Despite his woes, Charles started the new year on genial form - perhaps helped along a subject, the environment, about which he is passionate. As a result, the car that got the royal seal of approval was the Nissan LEAF, an electric car that went into production in March 2013 and has since become the world's best-selling electric vehicle. In total, 7,000 have been sold in the UK with more than 158,000 snapped up by eco-friendly drivers worldwide. 'We were honoured to receive a visit from the Prince of Wales,' said Paul Willcox, chairman of Nissan Europe afterwards. 'With a keen, lifelong interest in sustainability, His Royal Highness was interested to see LEAF production as well as hear about Sunderland’s achievements as one of the UK’s most successful car plants.' Back to work: Charles, who has spent the last few weeks at Birkhall, was undertaking his first visit of 2015 . Packed schedule: The 66-year-old royal is set for a busy week with several engagements pencilled in . Interest: The visit to the Nissan factory in Sunderland also dovetails with Charles' interest in technology . Exciting year: The Prince of Wales will become a grandfather for the second time in April . The visit also allowed Charles to start 2015 with a glimpse of another project close to his heart: helping young people into careers. After leaving the car behind on the production line, the royal made a detour to the Nissan Global Training Centre, where apprentices are taught the ropes. Charles has long had an interest in manufacturing, using a speech at the Science Museum on December to expand on his hopes for the future of heavy industry. 'This country really does have the most enviable history of enterprise in the fields of engineering, science, technology and manufacturing,' he said, before warning that a shortage of engineers could bring all this grinding to a halt. 'While all of this is going on,' he continued, 'there are still high levels of youth unemployment, as I know only too well through the work of my Prince’s Trust. 'Many of these young people could, with the right opportunity and training, fill some of the gaps.' Dapper: Charles cut a dapper figure in his pinstriped suit and floral print tie and matching pocket square . Vrooom! The prince bursts into laughter as he races pupils from St Cuthbert's Catholic High School . Eco-friendly: Prince Charles inspects a cutaway version of the Nissan LEAF showing its inner workings . Some of those who could one day fill those gaps were on hand to meet Prince Charles was introduced to some of Nissan's  'industrial cadets'  - children who want to learn more about engineering, to put their lessons into practice. The children, from Gillis Lane Primary School in Sunderland and St. Cuthbert's in Newcastle, were waiting for him at the Training Centre, with  Charles clearly enjoying his chat with them - and the chance to indulge in a race using toy cars designed with the help of Nissan. Speaking about the scheme, Nissan's Kevin Fitzpatrick said: 'Nissan launched the Skills Foundation last year with the aim of using everything from electric vehicles to Formula One to encourage young people to take up careers in manufacturing and engineering. 'As one of the region’s largest employers it’s important that Nissan take a lead role. I was delighted for the opportunity to show The Prince of Wales just some of the activities that we offer the region’s schools.' Pro: Boxer Amir Khan gives Prince Charles and pensioner Marta Armstrong a lesson in iPad use . Helpful: Ms Armstrong, 63, was part of the group waiting at the National Citizen Service Sunderland branch . Fascinated: Charles speaks to 17-year-old Megan Dakers and her pupil, 75-year-old Doris Atkinson . The royal, who has a busy schedule of engagements planned for this week and next, will have ample opportunity to spend more time chatting with youngsters once his second grandchild arrives in April. Although the sex of the baby is not yet known, the Duchess of Cambridge told a teenager that she could 'feel it kicking' during a busy morning in Kensington yesterday. Indeed, Charles was given a further opportunity to meet young people when his second visit of the day took him to a National Citizen Service event, where he was also introduced to boxer Amir Khan. Khan, who is an ambassador for the NCS, and the prince were welcomed by 17-year-old Megan Dakers from Washington who was taking part in a scheme to teach the elderly how to use technology. With her was her pupil, 75-year-old Doris Atkinson, who was given a tutorial on the finer points of iPad use by a smiling Miss Dakers, watched by Prince Charles. Khan, meanwhile, offered a technology lesson of his own and showed 63-year-old Marta Armstrong how to use a tablet computer - much to her delight.

"A study has found that having to cope with stressful tasks can reduce a person's mental faculties to those of a small child, such as reacting emotionally . If you've ever felt so stressed at work you've considered throwing a tantrum, sulking or walking out, then you're not alone. A study has found that having to cope with stressful tasks can reduce a person's mental faculties to those of a small child. During tests, high levels of acute stress were found to lower the brain's ability to think critically, reason, and make practical decisions. These are traits typically seen in small children who have to respond emotionally to situations they find difficult, said the study. Researchers from Brighton-based Mindlab, which carried out the study for healthcare providers Benenden Health, asked 200 volunteers to take part in mental agility trials. The group was split in half, and 100 participants additionally took part in a series of stress-inducing tasks before and in-between the trials. The results 'overwhelmingly' showed that stressed participants were more likely to make a wrong decision. They regularly chose the wrong answer, or reacted emotionally by making snap judgments based on a gut feeling. Toddlers typically respond in a similar way, emotionally, to problems they find hard to understand, instead of arriving at a considered logical solution, said the researchers. Neuroscientist Dr David Lewis, director of Mindlab, said: 'When stressed, the focus of our attention tends to narrow and, if associated with strong emotions, we tend to act less rationally on occasions. During trials, in which 100 volunteers were put through stress-inducing tasks, results overwhelmingly' showed stressed participants were more likely to react emotionally. Acute stress was also found to lower their ability to think critically, reason, and make decisions. Such traits are similar to those seen in toddlers (stock image) Researchers from  Mindlab asked 200 volunteers to take part in mental agility trials. The group was split in half, and 100 participants additionally took part in a series of stress-inducing tasks before and in-between the trials. The results 'overwhelmingly' showed that stressed participants were more likely to make a wrong decision, choose a wrong answer, or react emotionally by making snap judgments based on a gut feeling. Toddlers typically respond emotionally to problems they find hard to understand, instead of arriving at a considered logical solution in a similar way, said the researchers. 'Of course, this depends both on the stressor and other factors such as personality and the coping strategies available to the individual. 'When stress arises unexpectedly, and is especially overwhelming, rational thinking tends to be replaced by impulsive and often faulty decision making. 'This can be compared to a small child who responds emotionally to situations he or she finds stressful and frustrating.' Richard Carlton-Crabtree, from Benenden Health's counselling service provider, Insight Healthcare, added: 'Many people harbour the view that a little bit of stress may be healthy as the added pressure that stress causes can positively affect their performance. 'But this research shows that even small amounts of stress can have negative effects. 'This should reassure people that they should seek help and support when the onset of stress begins, because it can have a detrimental effect from day one acted correctly.'","Volunteers took part in trials carried out by researchers from Mindlab .

"This is the moment that two women were struck by a falling scaffolding pole in a London street - leaving them both with serious head injuries. In the 59 second clip the victims, aged 53 and 72, were left lying motionless on the ground after being felled by the pole in the heart of London's financial district. One women crashed onto her side and the other onto her front as they were hit by the piece of metal. Scroll down for video . Two women were left with head injuries after being hit by a metal scaffolding pole which fell from a building in the heart of London's financial district. Pictured: Evidence CCTV footage of the women . As passers-by went to help the pair they were seen pointing up at the building where the pole had fallen from. The women were taken to hospital after the incident at noon yesterday and are still being treated for head injuries. Police arrested a 31-year-old man after the incident, which happened on the other side of the street from a scaffolding-clad building in the City of London. He has been released on police bail pending further inquires. One witness, city trader Michael Jarman, 28, said: 'I was taking a stroll along Liverpool Street to pick up some superglue from Maplins listening to my Will Smith music when I saw it. 'There were two women lying on the floor. One wasn't moving and the other had blood all over her face and was screaming. 'I jumped to the conclusion that the scaffolding had come apart and hit them, but they were on the other side of the road to where the scaffolding was on the building. The CCTV footage shows the two women, aged 53 and 72, walking down the street together . Moments later the metal pole is seen to strike the pair as they walk along the London street in the heart of the financial district . Both women immediately crash to the ground. The metal scaffolding pole can be seen lying next to them . 'It looked to me like there were a few poles from the scaffolding. It was terrible. Emergency workers were treating them - I hope they are OK.' Medics at the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel, east London, were continuing to treat their head injuries. A jeweller reported passers-by rushing to the women's aid and pointing at the sky in the moments after the incident. Peter Robinson, who was working at the Jewel Shop next to where the women were hit, said: 'I think the pole slipped out of the hands of a worker from the building site across the road. One women was left sprawled on her side and the other crashed over onto her front . Passers-by raced to help the stricken pair and appeared as they lay injured on the pavement . Passers-by pointed up at the sky as they appeared to try and explain to each other where the pole had come from . 'It flew across the street and smashed a window on one of the floors above us, then it fell to the street and hit these poor old ladies. 'I rushed outside and saw a lot of blood on the ground. One was lying on her side, another was crouched against the wall. I called the ambulance straight away and they were here very quickly. 'It really shook me up. I'm usually out there at exactly that time sweeping the road. It could very easily have been me, it could have been anyone. Investigation: A witness said the women were on the opposite side of the street to this building . 'My sister came to see me just ten minutes later and it really shook me up thinking that it could have easily been her. 'I don't know much about who these two women were. They were dressed like ladies enjoying a day out, they didn't look as though they worked in the City. 'I just hope they're all right. I was amazed to see they were still breathing, it looked like such a horrific accident.' Aftermath: Workers at the building site across the street from where the women were hit in central London . The road was closed until around 3pm yesterday while police investigated. A police investigation on suspicion of grievous bodily harm is unusual for an accident, which would more usually trigger an investigation by the Health and Safety Executive instead. A City of London police spokesman said: 'We are appealing for anyone who saw a metal scaffold pole fall from a building on Eldon Street in the Square Mile yesterday lunchtime  to get in contact. A witness said: 'It really shook me up. I'm usually out there at exactly that time sweeping the road' 'Two women, aged 72 and 53, suffered serious head injuries as a result of the incident – reported to police at around 11.45am - and are currently being treated in hospital. 'A 31-year-old man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of Grievous Bodily Harm and was taken into custody, but has since been released on bail. 'Work was being conducted at the time of the incident on the scaffolding, which has since been inspected by the Health and Safety Executive and deemed to be in a satisfactory condition. 'The City of London Police are now assisting the Health and Safety Executive in gathering material to establish how this incident happened.'

"MI5 spent years trying to decipher crop circles amid fears they were being used to guide Nazi bombers, secret documents from the Second World War have revealed. The files, held in the National Archives, show how British spies suspected Nazi sympathisers were sending secret messages to the enemy using ground markings. Among the suspected codes was a mysterious marking in a cornfield that was shaped like the letter 'G', with its tail appearing to point to a munitions factory in Glascoed, Monmouthshire. Scroll down for video . MI5 spent years trying to decipher crop circles, including this 'G' shape which appeared in a Monmouthshire field amid fears they were being used to guide Nazi bombers, secret files from the Second World War reveal . Other suspicious marks which showed up when British spies investigated  aerial photographs were strange marks in a field near Newquay, Cornwall, and a white circle with the word 'Marden' inscribed inside it in a field near Staplehurst, Kent, while agents were also tasked with probing reports of lights in the sky. The British security service had started looking into the marks after learning that in Poland, Holland, France and Belgium, cornfields had been cut into 'guiding marks for aircraft', with spies beating out marks to assist Luftwaffe pilots find their targets. Fearing that a 'Fifth Column' of Nazi sympathisers were working inside Britain, MI5 dedicated agents to investigating reports of suspected enemy activity, including 'cornfield codes' spotted in fields. The files, held in the National Archives, show how British spies suspected Nazi sympathisers were sending secret messages to the enemy using ground markings, such as these discovered in a farmer's field in 1940 . MI5 started looking into the marks after learning that in Europe, cornfields were cut into 'guiding marks for aircraft', with spies beating out marks to help Luftwaffe pilots (pictured) find their targets . 'They began investigating into the Fifth Column after the invasion of the Low Countries and France where German spies had used landing lights to guide them to the places where the Nazis wanted to attack,' said Dr David Clarke, senior lecturer in journalism at Sheffield Hallam University who has studied the files for his book Britain's X-traordinary Files. 'In 1940, everyone in Britain thought ""we're next"", and that Germany would have recruited spies in England as well who would be sending messages to the Germans and marking places out where landings could be made. 'The German Operation Sealion led people, including the police, Winston Churchill and MI5 to suspect there was an active Fifth Column and there is an MI5 file in the National Archives that's absolutely full of weird things that were brought to their attention.' The MI5 report into the markings discovered at Little Mill, Monmouthshire, which turned out to have been made accidentally by a farmer trying to get rid of a supply of barley seed . It was feared that Luftwaffe pilots flying over Britain could be guided to targets with messages on the ground . Included in the file is the report from the marking found in the field at Little Mill, Monmouthshire in 1941. It stated that the 33 yards long shape had been made by 'sowing barley seeds transversely through the grain', and the tail of the G was pointing towards the munitions factory in nearby Glascoed. 'In May 1941 a report was made that an unusual mark was visible amongst the growing corn. Near one of the gates was a mark in the form of the letter G, some 33 yards long. This mark had been made by sowing barley transversely through the grain.' 'Air photographs were taken and it was seen that the tail of the marking pointed towards the Ordnance factory at Glascoed. The farmer, a man of good character, was interviewed, and admitted that he had sown the field himself. He explained that he had sold the field in April. 'Shortly after, having a drilling machine nearby which had a small quantity of barley seed in it, and wishing to empty it as he had to return it to the farmer from whom he had borrowed it that night, he turned his team of horses into the grain field and drilled it into the ground thickly to get rid of it. He did this because it is extremely difficult to remove the grain in the machine by hand, and to sow it was the quickest way of getting rid of it. 'He agreed to plough up this part of the field. As a satisfactory explanation had been reached, the case was carried no further.' 'It was spotted from the air by the RAF pilot who had been given instructions to look for anything suspicious,' Dr Clarke told MailOnline. 'A farmer had left a ""G"" shape and it just so happened that the tail of the G was pointing towards an Ordnance factory. 'When the RAF saw that from the air they thought it was a German spy and the poor farmer was surrounded by MI5 agents. 'But there was a perfectly innocent explanation.' It transpired the farmer had sown the barley seed in order to get rid of it, having sold his farm and needing to return a drilling seed he had borrowed. Likewise, a marking in a field in Newquay was discovered to have been made by heaps of lime used for agricultural purposes, and the Marden sign in Staplehurst had been left behind from its days as an emergency landing ground by Imperial Airways, which eventually though a number of mergers became British Airways. 'In the files are a number of things that if people had seen them recently would be thought of as alien activity such as lights in the sky or crop circles,' said Dr Clarke. 'In 1940, people weren't pre-occupied with UFOs, they were pre-occupied with Nazis. 'The amount of time and energy that MI5 put into investigating these reports is astonishing. They had three officers full time based in the Eastern counties looking for lights in the sky they thought were agents signalling to German aircraft ""this way to Norwich"".' He added: 'When people are worried, like they are now with the possibility of Islamic terrorism, they can interpret normal things as signs that horrible things are going to happen. 'That's why MI5 is interested in things like sightings of flying saucers - but they are interested in the fact there may be more grounded reasons for them.'","Files in National Archives show British spies' fears over Nazi sympathisers .

"The Facebook page for a high-end nanny agency in New York has turned into a real life version of the hit 2002 novel The Nanny Diaries, revealing some of the most over-the-top requests made by rich families seeking household help. The staff behind Abigail Madison Nanny and Household Staffing Inc post a variety of advertisements for a wide range of positions on the company's Facebook page, each of which include a detailed description of what the family require from any future employee. From speaking fluent Filipino to being a professionally-qualified chef, there seems to be no end to the lofty expectations held by some of New York's most eligible families when it comes to finding the perfect person to care for their children. '[There are some] I would definitely call strange,' agency owner Erin Maloney-Winder told ABC News of the weird and wonderful requests her company receives. Scroll down for video . Weird and wonderful demands: The ads featured on the Abigail Madison Facebook page include a variety of requirements, including some parents who insist their nanny must be able to home-school their children . 'The most bizarre requests are generally when a parent is requiring a nanny to speak three languages,' she added to Daily Mail Online. 'And we also have parents requesting nannies to hold a master's degree and work six days.' Much like those stories detailed in the New York Times best-selling novel The Nanny Diaries, which was written by former nannies Emma McLaughlin and Nicola Kraus before being turned into a movie starring Scarlett Johansson, the requests details on the company's Facebook page range from the most simple - to the most complex. For example, one Upper West Side family stated that any eager applicants for the position available in their household must be fluent in both English and Tagalog, a Filipino dialect most commonly used in Manila. 'You must be legal to work and you must have references working as a nanny, and you MUST speak English and Tagalog  fluently,' the family's ad explains, while another states: 'Please be able to clean a large formal home... 'The family has parties at their weekend home, so it is helpful if you know how to set a formal table and if you can cook healthy meals.' One family asks that their nanny be able to take their children out for play dates - and Broadway auditions - offering a salary of $16 per hour to the successful applicant. Indeed, while some families are prepared to make extravagant demands of their future nanny or housekeeper, their salary offers don't always match up to their over-the-top requirements. Great expectations: Many wealthy New York-based families, like the family featured in hit 2007 movie The Nanny Diaries (pictured), require their nannies to speak at least two languages fluently . According to ABC, one Manhattan-based mother asked that Abigail Madison find her a nanny who could work a 50-hour week, which included home-schooling her six children, all for just $450 per week, or just $9 per hour. The average salary offered to nannies sourced by Abigail Madison is $800 per week for just two children - and that usually doesn't involve home-schooling of any kind. But for those nannies who are able to meet the strict requirements of many of the families - there are usually some incredibly impressive rewards on offer. Many of the parents require that their household staff accompany them on all-expenses-paid holidays, with one family asking that their nanny be willing to travel with them on annual trips to Europe and Hawaii. Another ad, which is calling for a 'very in shape, athletic and energetic' college graduate, includes the promise of regular stays at the family's summer home in Westchester, as well as month-long getaways in South Africa and Italy. 'We do have wonderful clients who offer five weeks of paid vacation and $65,000 per year for 45 hours with health insurance,' Ms Maloney-Winder added to Daily Mail Online. 'We also have clients who allow nannies to order whatever food they want for lunch every day, buy their nannies Prada snow pants when they go skiing and we even had a client pay for a nanny's plane ticket to Wisconsin when her mother was in the hospital. 'Additionally, we have clients who give $5,000 to $10,000 Christmas bonuses on occasion, but a bonus like that is rare.'","Childcare agency Abigail Madison Nanny and Household Staffing posts a variety of advertisements for household staff on its Facebook page .

"Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (pictured) said the planned  NHS strike next Thursday ‘has the potential to affect patient safety to an unacceptable level’ A mass walkout by NHS staff including some paramedics and emergency workers next week could cost lives, the Health Secretary warned last night. In a blunt warning to the unions, Jeremy Hunt said the planned 12-hour strike next Thursday ‘has the potential to affect patient safety to an unacceptable level, especially at a time of intense winter pressures’. Five health unions, representing hundreds of thousands of NHS staff, are threatening to walk out next week in a long-running dispute over pay. A further 24-hour strike is planned next month. Talks to avert the strikes broke up inconclusively last night, but will resume this evening. But health sources said there was no more money for pay – and warned that meeting the unions’ demands would cost thousands of jobs. Mr Hunt warned the unions that patients will die unless they agree to guarantee emergency cover on a national basis during the strikes, but was unable to secure an agreement. It means that, at present, there is no deal to provide ambulance cover for 999 calls, or to respond to national emergencies, such as a terrorist attack. In a letter to union leaders last night Mr Hunt warned of the danger the strike poses to patients. He said: ‘Today I have received a letter from NHS England advising me of their concerns that your current plans will pose a real risk that patients with life threatening conditions are harmed.’ The unions – which have all attacked the government over NHS performance during the winter – also risk charges of hypocrisy by urging their members to walk out at a time when the service is stretched to the limit. The Unison union, which is leading negotiations, last night said union leaders would meet this lunchtime to consider providing emergency cover. They will then hold further talks with Mr Hunt this evening. Christina McAnea, head of health at Unison, last night said the unions ‘share the government’s concerns about patient safety and hope we can have sensible discussions tomorrow on how to resolve this dispute’. She said it was encouraging that the talks are continuing, but voiced concern about the Government’s refusal to increase the overall pay offer. The strikes were called after Mr Hunt ruled last year that a recommended one per cent pay rise should not be paid in full. Around 600,000 NHS workers in line for an automatic pay ‘increment’ will not also receive the one per cent. The mass walkout by NHS staff, including some paramedics and emergency workers, next Thursday is over a long-running dispute over pay. A further 24-hour strike by NHS workers is planned next month (file picture) The strike is potentially embarrassing for Labour, as it involves the party’s three biggest donors, Unison, Unite and the GMB. Between them the three unions have given Labour an astonishing £25 million since Mr Miliband became party leader. Labour has refused to condemn the planned strikes – and is pressing ministers to cave in to the unions’ demands on pay. But Mr Hunt warned last night that the pay demands would cost the NHS an extra £450 million – equivalent to the cost of employing 14,000 newly-qualified nurses. ‘At a time when the NHS is under unprecedented pressure, it would be totally wrong to consider any pay policy which would have the effect of forcing the local NHS to employ less staff, which would inevitably have a serious impact on patient care.’ Talks today are expected to focus on redistributing the overall pay increase among NHS workers. A health source said the Government ‘cannot afford to increase the overall NHS pay bill’.","NHS strike planned for 12 hours next week over long-running pay dispute .

"Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker is being flamed online due to his recent attempt to cultivate facial hair. The former footballer, 54, has been compared to Guy Fawkes, Jimmy Hill and Colonel Saunders after growing a greying moustache and goatee-beard. Others said the former Everton striker looked as if he should be appearing in The Three Musketeers. Scroll down for video .

Internet wags have compared the former Everton striker with KFC founder Colonel Saunders . Others have said that the goatee beard makes him look like someone from the Gunpowder Plot . Lineker, right, with his wife Danielle, left, started wearing the goatee on Friday's Graham Norton show . RossEFC95 claimed: 'Gary Lineker is turning into Jimmy Hill. Suddenly has a pointy chin with a terrible goatee beard.' Jimmy Hill appeared on Match of the Day over four decades appearing on the show more than 600 times. He was renowned for his pronounced chin and highly sculpted beard. One Twitter user, Mr Meeow claimed: 'Gary Lineker needs to lose the three musketeers beard. Grow old gracefully.'

Another asked whether he was following the style of celebrity baker Paul Hollywood. Michelle Jones added: 'Gary ""Guy Fawkes"" Lineker looking ever more like a supporter of ""The Gunpowder Plot"". Great beard Gary!'. Such is the impact of the former Barcelona man's beard that it has even got it's own Twitter account, following the example of Donald Trump's hair, which is regularly lampooned on the internet.

"Fresh-faced and dressed in a simple white shirt, the woman peering out of Richard Young's portrait of Sophie Wessex released over the weekend appeared to be in her mid-30s at most. But the while the Countess of Wessex might have the complexion of a much-younger woman, she is celebrating her 50th birthday today. So how has she managed to stay so fresh faced? 'Her secret is a good skincare routine and a healthy living,' says skin expert Samantha Gilbert of Swiss skincare brand Cellcosmet. Scroll down for video . Fresh-faced: At 50, Sophie Wessex still has the glowing complexion of a much-younger woman . 'Sophie is always smiling and looking happy too and this also has an effect on the skin.' And as she celebrates her half-century with a visit to a London hospital, the Countess has plenty to smile about. The mother of two young children, 11-year-old Lady Louise Windsor and seven-year-old James, Viscount Severn, Sophie juggles family life with an increasingly busy schedule of royal engagements - including two today. Like much of the work she does, the focus will be on the disadvantaged and disabled with the visit including a trip to see the work of the Avoidable Blindness Programme which is funded by the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Trust. And in a further sign of Sophie's popularity within the royal family - in particular with the Queen - the Countess is set to be confirmed as vice-patron of the Trust, second only to the monarch. But while her extensive charity work might fly relatively under the radar, her increasing sartorial confidence hasn't gone unnoticed - and neither has her fresh-faced complexion. Confident: The 50-year-old Countess (left) is more confident now than she was in her late 30s (right) Good bone structure: Sophie looks little different now to the way she did at 35 (pictured here in 2000) Stylish: As these photographs of Sophie prior to her marriage reveal, her style has changed considerably . Softer: She keeps her make-up natural and gives her complexion a boost with regular exercise . What's more, none of it, says top cosmetic surgeon Dr Roberto Viel, is the result of surgical nips and tucks. 'Sophie is proof that lots of sleep and eating well keep you looking young,' says Dr Viel. 'Stop calorie counting and start enjoying the right foods. 'Sophie also has great bone structure which always helps.' Lily Simpson, a nutritional expert and founder of The Detox Kitchen, agrees. 'Sophie Wessex looks fabulous at 50 thanks to her beautiful glowing skin. 'A diet of plant-based foods and lean protein has a huge impact on the appearance of skin, as does keeping well hydrated and getting proper sleep.' Exercise is also crucial for keeping the years at bay, although as Rosalind Chapman, founder of cosmeceutical brand Transformulas, points out, this needs to be supplemented with good skincare. 'Sophie  leads a very healthy lifestyle - she rides horses and runs regularly both of which help keep her body and skin in great condition,' explains Chapman. 'She also lives out in the country which means there is less exposure to the damage caused by pollution and free radicals.' But that's not all. 'The tone and texture of her skin is beautiful which suggests she uses some sort of brightening serum,' continues Chapman. 'Although she has some fine lines, her complexion is peaches and cream and that is what is most important for mature skin. A lack of tone and texture is far more ageing than lines and wrinkles.' That Sophie manages to pull all this off, despite having an increasingly busy schedule is no mean feat, although her embrace of cleverly applied make-up undoubtedly helps. Careful choices: Her choice of make-up echoes the increasingly sophisticated shades in her wardrobe . Getting it right: The Countess of Wessex goes natural by day but ups the ante - just about - at night . Low key: Sophie, seen here meeting actress Laura Carmichael, opts for delicate peachy shades on cheeks . 'Sophie has a great way of keeping her make up very balanced and clean,' explains bareMinerals make-up artist Sarah-Jane Froom. 'She lives by the less is more rule, which, when you are a public figure representing the royal family, is important.' But, adds Froom, low key doesn't mean boring. 'Sophie keeps it classic but adds an up-to-date edge by subtly following tone and shade trends in her lip and blush and also the finish on her skin. 'This could mean making her look slightly more dewy or matte, using different shades of peach or pink nudes on lips and livening the whole thing up by adding a pop of soft pink or peach on the cheeks. 'Eyes are kept to a minimum but with definition. You will notice Sophie generally keeps most of the eye make-up to the top lid - this is a great way of keeping a look more natural.' Her embrace of nude make-up echoes the soft palette that dominates her wardrobe. Gone are the pillarbox reds and lilacs that dominated her early years in the royal family and in their place are subtle cream, delicate shell pink and dramatic black. Flattering: Sophie's glowing complexion is helped along by flattering colour choices . Warm: Sophie gives 10-year-old Abigail McCorquodale a hug during a visit to Jeneece Place in Victoria . Chic: Sophie offset the dramatic black ensemble worn to last June's Royal Ascot with natural make-up . Looking good: As Sophie Wessex enters her sixth decade, she looks lovelier than ever . Nowhere was this more obvious than during her appearance at church alongside the rest of the royal family at Sandringham last Christmas. Resplendent in a powder pink coat, a smiling Sophie looked fresh-face and glowing, with the rosy colour of the coat emphasising naturally rosy cheeks. She pulled off the same trick during a pre-Christmas visit to the races at Ascot in Berkshire, echoing the deep charcoal shade of her tweed suit in her soft, grey eyeliner. At Royal Ascot last June, the glamorous Countess ensured all eyes were on her - despite facing stiff competition from the Queen and other members of the royal family - when she showed up in a dramatic all-black ensemble teamed with fresh pink cheeks and minimal eye make-up. This less-is-more approach is key to looking good in your 50s, says make-up artist Mikey Phillips, who explains that the key to taking 10 years off is to keep your look fresh but polished. 'Sophie is a fan of minimal make-up but she isn't afraid to use make-up to define her features,' he explains. 'The result is youthful, classic and timeless.' Fresh-faced: Sophie Wessex might be 50 but she looks as glamorous as ever . While Sophie Wessex benefits from having beautiful skin and a great bone structure, those not so blessed can recreate the look using make-up. Celebrity make-up artist Mikey Phillips explains how getting Sophie's fresh-faced glow is done (and all within 10 minutes): . SKIN . 'Prep skin for make-up with a really good primer. I Love Charlotte Tilbury's Magic Cream (£70, charlottetilbury.com), which hydrates and adds radiance while making cosmetics stay on longer. Next choose a light reflecting concealer such as Joan Collins Beauty Fade to Perfect (£18, joancollinsbeauty.com) in a shade that is one lighter than your real skin tone. Apply all around the eye area and pat gently into place, This should lift your entire face and give the illusion of eight hours sleep. Foundation is also key to getting a youthful look but make sure it's something light-reflective and moisturising such as YSL Le Teint Touche Éclat Foundation (£30.50, yslbeauty.co.uk). Blend the foundation around the concealer - don't be tempted to go over it - and make sure it's an exact match with your skintone. CHEEKS . A cream blush such as Bobbi Brown's Pot Rouge (£19, bobbibrown.co.uk) will give you an instant glow while the creamy formula won't collect in any wrinkles. Apply it to the apples of your cheeks using your fingers and blend it back towards the hairline. LIPS . Colour your lips using the same cream blush you used on your cheeks and finish with a lipliner - a beauty essential for older women. Lips shrink as you age, so a defined lip line can help lift and define the face. I like the Estée Lauder Double Wear Stay In Place Lip Pencil (£17, esteelauder.co.uk). EYES . As Sophie's defined brows demonstrate, groomed eyebrows totally change your face and pull up the eye area and the whole face with it. Choose a shade a little darker than your hair then start filling in using tiny strokes from the inside edges out. Extend the line past the end of your lashes to frame your face and knock off the years. New CID Cosmetics i-groom is great for natural-looking brows (£17, newcidcosmetics.com). Use a neutral base such as the ones found in Burberry's Complete Eye Palette in Pale Nude (£40, burberry.com) on the eyelids themselves, colouring from lash to brow, and then add a mid tone from base to crease. Sweep the same shade underneath the lower lashes to really this same shade and sweep underneath lower lashes to open up the eyes. Finally, finish off the look with a sweep of black eyeliner across the top lashes and two coats of mascara to make eyes pop. I swear by Bobbi Brown Gel Eyeliner in Black Brown (£18, bobbibrown.co.uk) and CODE Volumising Lengthening Mascara in black (£19.95, code-beautiful.com). Although lots of people think brown is softer, I always avoid it because it tends to make eyes look tired and sore.'","Sophie, Countess of Wessex celebrates her 50th birthday today .

"Sending yourself flowers from your imaginary boyfriend is a thing of the past. Whether you are lonely or just plain sick of explaining why you are single, the Invisible Boyfriend (or Invisible Girlfriend) app created by Matthew Homann and Kyle Tabor allows users to experience the fake relationships of their dreams. For $24.99 a month you can immediately feel the effects of a rewarding virtual partner with the app designed to send users texts, voicemails and even a handwritten note from the perfect person that they created. When FEMAIL learned that the Minnesota-based app had launched in BETA today, we knew we had to try it. Scroll down for video . Handsome and mysterious: The Invisible Boyfriend and Invisible Girlfriend apps are designed to send users texts, voicemails and even a handwritten notes to make it look as though they are in a real relationship . Virtual affair: Erica Tempesta tried out the new app and spent the day chatting with her imaginary boyfriend 'Liam Alexander James' Despite having a real boyfriend of seven years, I was quick to start designing my dream guy and embark on my virtual affair. First up, I had to pick my lover's name and age. I soon learned that choosing your boyfriend's name is stressful. I imagine that I took the same amount of time someone would take to name their first born son before finally settling on the moniker: Liam Alexander James. Age was easier to dream up. My current boyfriend is nine months younger than me, which he never lets me forget. With that in mind, I made my new partner an older, more mature 33 years old. I was then prompted to pick a photo that would represent Liam's appearance. I settled on the stock photo of a man with an attractive amount of facial scruff and moved on. After dealing with the physical, I was asked about my virtual partner's personality and interests. I knew I wanted him to be 'witty and educated,' so it made sense for him to also be interested in books, sports and chess. For one fleeting moment, I thought he might be able to teach me how to play the board game. Next, I was asked to describe how Liam and I met. This was my moment to create a Nora Ephron-inspired rom com, but instead, I wrote that we grabbed the same book that was on display at the bookstore. Cute enough. Did I mention this app is thorough? Invisible man: The website allows you to choose your boyfriend's age, location and personal interests . Total babe: For $24.99 a month, you can start an imaginary relationship with one of these anonymous men, whose photos are available on the app's website . As soon as I reached the end of the questionnaire, I received my first text message from Liam Alexander James of Chicago, Illinois. His phone number even had an actual Chicago area code. 'Hey Erica! This is Liam :) How are you?' he wrote. Ugh, I hate when guys use emoticons. Although I had no idea who I was texting, it was clear that there was a real, albeit mysterious, person having casual conversation with me. When I told him I was working, he immediately took interest in the story I was writing, which was actually sweet. Since I don't live with my new boyfriend, I asked him if he wanted to hang out. After some brief hesitation on his end, I decided to test his limits and start nagging him. 'What is taking you so long to answer?' I asked. He quickly bypassed the argument I was trying to start by saying he would 'love' to hang out, considerately asking what I wanted to do. Extracurricular activities: The website gives you the option to tailor his personality and lifestyle according to your own interests and needs . Magic man: 'Liam' actually referenced the first time he and Erica 'met' in one of the text messages he had sent . 'I dunno. I am sick of making plans,' I texted back. 'What do you want to do?' Liam then suggested we order takeout and have a game night before noting that we can also grab dinner later if I wanted. It occurred to me that my last 'date night' with my human boyfriend involved us watching TV in separate rooms. I wanted to learn more about my mystery man, so I asked Liam to remind me where he worked again. 'I work for a publishing company,' he replied. 'Remember I told you at the bookstore?' Liam is so perfect that he even remembers the first place we met. Realizing that my new boyfriend deals with books all day, I asked him to recommend a good a thriller that I could read in his absence - and that's where I lost him. I am not sure if my question was too thought-provoking, but I started to feel a familiar panic. 'Why isn't he answering me?' I thought. Make believe: The app will create a story to explain how you and your fake partner first met . Multiple uses: Users are asked why they want to have an invisible boyfriend . At one point, I even caught myself drafting messages that I wanted to send to him but then deleted - just as if he were a real guy who was ignoring me. I eventually tried to win him back, texting: 'I'm sorry. I know you hate when I ask you questions at work, but I miss you boo.' And I got nothing. Liam and I broke up before I could even ask him where our relationship was going. I actually had a great time talking to my imaginary boyfriend, and it was nice to know that I could easily win Liam back with a quick payment of $24.99. While it is fun to use, the app was created to alleviate the society's pressure to be in a relationship by allowing to make it look like they are. Mr. Homann explained that he came up with the idea when he was newly divorced and tired of being pushed to start dating again. ""Around Thanksgiving, my mom called me and asked if she should set an extra place for someone I’m bringing,” he recalled on the app's website. Rain check? While users are able to make plans with their boyfriends, the date is obviously never going to happen . 'In that moment I realized how great it would be to have an answer for her that didn't require me to actually be dating someone.' Even if you are currently dating, the Invisible Boyfriend and Girlfriend apps allow you to work on your texting skills by having you interact with another human. And if the person you are with isn't ready to commit? You can easily invent a person who is trying to steal you away. In the technological age, there seems to be an app for all of your romantic needs. In 2012, conflicted women were able to download the Should I Break Up With My Boyfriend? app in order to figure out if they should stay with their partner or end their relationships. Coincidentally, the following year saw the creation of BreakUpText, an app that offers multiple options for users to end their relationships electronically with little to no fuss. And then 2014 was the year of the BroApp. Lazy men around the world rejoiced when they learned of the electronic tool that pre-programs and sends text message to women, so they will feel adequately adored.","Co-founders Matthew Homann and Kyle Tabor created the Invisible Boyfriend and Invisible Girlfriend apps to alleviate societal pressure to be in a relationship .

"More than three years after Steve Jobs passed away, it seems that his widow Laurene Powell has found love again. The 51-year-old billionaire business exec was seen enjoying a Caribbean vacation with former Washington D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty, 44, this weekend. The pair looked at ease as they laughed together aboard a luxury yacht from the Cayman Islands, cooled off in their swimsuits and got close on the sun loungers, before sharing a meal with friends. The couple was first rumored to be dating in the summer of 2013 but these are among the first photos of their budding romance. Scroll down for video . Together: Laurene Powell, the widow of Steve Jobs, was seen enjoying a vacation in the Caribbean with former Washington D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty on Saturday . All smiles: They are believed to have started dating in 2013 but have not been pictured together before . Break: Fenty, who was mayor between 2007 and 2011, split from his wife Michelle in 2013 . Going for a dip: The couple sunned themselves on the sun loungers after apparently going for a swim . Shared interests: The couple, who first met in 2011, now both work in education reform . Powell was left widowed after Apple founder Steve Jobs passed away, aged 56, from complications from pancreatic cancer in October 2011. They had three children together and Powell is also step-mother to Jobs' daughter, Lisa Brennan-Jobs. Fenty, mayor of Washington D.C. between 2007 and 2011, formally announced his separation from his wife of 15 years, Michelle, in January 2013. They also have three children together. Sources told the Washington Post that summer that Fenty and Powell started seeing each other around the same time, but there is no suggestion that Powell had anything to do with the separation. It is believed the two met at a Houston education conference in 2011 and bonded over school reform; Powell is the founder of Emerson Collective, which advocates for education reform, among others, while Fenty's focus during his mayorship with education.

'Adrian Fenty is one of our country's great advocates for education reform,' she said in a statement at the time. 'His sense of urgency and record of accomplishment is unparalleled.' The pair were first friends, sources told the Washington Post, before they started dating at the start of 2013. In June 2014, the couple was pictured at a French open match together. Powell had married Jobs two years after meeting him when he gave a talk to Stanford Business School while she was a student there. Their wedding took place in March 1991 at a hotel in Yosemite Valley, and the ceremony was led by a Zen Buddhist monk, Kobun Chino Otogawa, in keeping with Jobs' religious beliefs. Their eldest child, a son named Reed, was born six months later, and the couple had two daughters, Erin and Eve, in the years following.

Hanging out: The couple have shied away from the spotlight since dating over the past couple of years . While she was on the boards of several companies and charities during his lifetime, it was only after he died that she began to speak publicly to draw attention to the causes that mattered to her. They were married for 20 years and after his death, she inherited an estate of about $10 billion. Despite being one of the richest women in the U.S. she has kept a deliberately low profile as she continues with her charitable work. Since Fenty left the mayor's office, he has focused on acting as a consultant to education tech companies and working as a special adviser at Andreessen Horowitz.

"Abandoned rowing machines are today gathering dust in basements and garages the world over.

"Hilda Holland, pictured here with husband John, has vowed to never fly again after she was hit on the head by a shoe that fell from a locker . A Thomas Cook plane was forced to make an emergency landing after a pensioner was knocked unconscious by a shoe that fell from an overhead locker. Hilda Holland, 79, was stretchered off the plane after the freak accident when a fellow passenger opened the locker to take out some warm clothing and the heavy leather suede shoe fell. The retired gas worker said: 'I blame it on people trying to take too much luggage on the plane because they don't want to pay as much. It was obviously a loose shoe that wasn't in a bag secure and I am lucky I wasn't more seriously injured. 'We won't fly any more. That was a wake-up call for us. It was actually quite embarrassing, knowing that I managed to ground a plane.' Passengers are charged to put their luggage into the hold on all Thomas Cook flights. Prices start from £19 for a 20kg bag on a short-haul flight; for a long haul journey the price is £28. Mrs Holland was taken from her aisle seat to the front of the plane and treated by two off-duty nurses who happened to be on the Thomas Cook Airbus A321-211. The plane then made an emergency diversion to Lisbon where she was quickly stretchered off and taken to hospital with her worried husband John, 77, who thought she was going to die. At the British Hospital Lisbon XXI Mrs Holland was given a CT scan which fortunately showed no permanent damage. But she was kept overnight for observation before the couple were allowed to return to the airport at 5am the next day. The retired couple then had to fork out £370 for a flight back to Birmingham International Airport and ended up going via Brussels in Belgium before getting home late on January 11. Mrs Holland, who lives with her husband in Rowley Regis, in the West Midlands, vowed never to fly again following their 'traumatic' ordeal that happened only 50 minutes into their flight from Fuerteventura to Birmingham. The pensioner said: 'I was sitting there and had just been talking to a lady sitting by me and all of a sudden I felt a bang on my head. 'The lady behind was pulling woolly clothing out of the overhead locker and with it came a loose shoe. 'My husband came over and asked what had happened and I must have gone into shock because I couldn't speak. The lady said sorry but I couldn't say anything back. A fellow passenger opened the overhead locker, similar to the one above, to get something out when a shoe fell, hitting Mrs Holland . 'I don't remember anything else because I must have gone unconscious but they took me to the front of the plane and curtained it off. 'They got permission to land in Lisbon and took me to the hospital where I had a scan and an injection because I had dehydrated so much. We left the hospital at 5am and got on the plane at 3.30pm and eventually got home about midnight. 'But we've been going on holiday flying abroad for a good many years now so it is a shame we won't be again. We said we will stop in this country now and maybe go on a coach trip. Its not worth the risk. My husband thought he'd lost me.' Husband John, who used to run a haulage firm, admitted he feared for his wife's life after the freak accident on flight TCX 4125. Hilda Holland, pictured with husband John, has told how a falling shoe on a Thomas Cook flight knocked her out, and left her husband fearing the worst . Mr and Mrs Holland have said they will never fly again after a shoe hit Mrs Holland causing her to fall seriously ill . He added: 'The woman sitting behind Hilda decided to get a cardigan from the locker but she pulled a shoe out with it. That came down and hit her on the back of the head and the ear. She said to me 'that came sharp'. 'Ten minutes later I looked over and she was shaking and pale. I thought she wasn't going to make it, I had never seen her like that. I've never been so worried in my life.' The couple's relatives only discovered about their ordeal from police because they didn't have a mobile phone with them. Megan Clancy and her boyfriend Ashley Statham were on the diverted Thomas Cook flight after Hilda Holland fell ill . Their nephew Chris Hill, 50, was left waiting at Birmingham Airport for six-and-a-half hours before eventually giving up and going home. John added: 'I asked two of the crew if they would phone Chris to let him know about our ordeal but they didn't. He was waiting in the airport for six-and-a-half hours before he eventually found out the plane had been delayed. 'We wanted to go home as quick as we could so we found a travel agent who got us a flight home to Birmingham via Brussels.' Fellow passengers on the diverted flight said cabin crew had 'panic in their eyes' as news of the emergency landing was relayed. Megan Clancy, 21, from Tamworth, Staffordshire, said: 'Two of the air stewardesses were serving us drinks. 'All of a sudden a woman came rushing up to the staff saying a lady around ten rows in front of us urgently needed help. Luckily there were two off duty nurses on board who raced to help. 'They started giving her oxygen, then took her to the front of the plane near the cockpit and pulled the curtain across. You could see panic in the eyes of the crew but they remained very calm. 'They reassured all the passengers and checked if anyone needed water.' The Hollands were returning from a two-week stay at the 4* Hotel Elba Sara in Fuerteventura. A spokesperson for Thomas Cook told MailOnline Travel: 'Our Operations Control Centre contacted Mr and Mrs Holland at the hospital and offered assistance within a few hours of their arrival. 'Mr Holland was grateful for the call and advised that he would make arrangements through his insurers and we ensured he had direct contact number for Thomas Cook. 'Staff from the airline worked to contact the relatives at Birmingham Airport without success. 'Our welfare team have been in touch with the Holland's following their return and we hope Mrs Holland makes a full recovery.'","Hilda Holland, 79, was badly injured on a Thomas Cook flight .

"Brown University officials  announced that two fraternities on the Ivy League campus have been sanctioned for hosting unregistered parties last fall, including one where two students reported drinking punch laced with a date-rape drug. School leaders announced the discipline against Phi Kappa Psi and Sigma Chi in a statement to the media and a letter to members of the university community. Brown officials said both fraternities created environments that 'facilitated' sexual misconduct. No members of the fraternities are accused by the school of sexual misconduct, and none of them face criminal charges. Brown University officials announced that two fraternities on the Ivy League campus have been sanctioned for hosting unregistered parties last fall, including one where two students reported drinking punch laced with a date-rape drug . Phi Kappa Psi will lose university recognition for four years, including the loss of housing on campus, effective immediately. School officials said the fraternity hosted a party in October and two students reported drinking a beverage containing a date-rape drug. Both students reported rapid intoxication followed by memory loss, and one of them reported being sexually assaulted. Brown officials said the assault was non-consensual contact that did not happen at the fraternity and did not involve a fraternity member, but was the result of the student's incapacitation. One of the students tested positive for gamma hydroxybutyrate, a date-rape drug also known as GHB, Brown officials have said. Sigma Chi was put on probation and its university privileges have been suspended until the fall of 2016. Brown officials said the fraternity cannot sponsor social events, has lost access to the chapter room, lounge, library and basement, and is ineligible to conduct recruitment, rush or initiation processes. School leaders announced the discipline against Phi Kappa Psi (pictured) and Sigma Chi in a statement to the media and a letter to members of the university community . School officials said Sigma Chi hosted an unregistered party in October where a student reported an incident of non-consensual sexual contact, but the student wasn't able to identify the person who touched her. 'The measures we are taking ... reflect our interest in preventing sexual assault by addressing the campus climate at Brown,' said Brown Executive Vice President Russell Carey and Vice President Margaret Klawunn in a letter to the campus community. 'All Brown community members need to be involved in preventing sexual violence, and all student organizations are expected to ensure that adequate security measures are in place to promote safe events and activities.' Carey and Klawunn also announced a comprehensive review of alcohol policy and regulations for social events. Officials with the national chapters of Phi Kappa Psi and Sigma Chi and an official with the Brown chapter of Sigma Chi did not return messages seeking comment Monday. A phone listing for the local Phi Kappa Psi chapter couldn't be found. Phi Kappa Psi members in a letter to The Brown Daily Herald last fall said that news involving the two students who reported the date-rape drug incident took them by surprise and they were confident 'that in no way did any member of Phi Kappa Psi engage in or perpetrate such atrocious and criminal behavior.' Brown officials said the sanctions against both fraternities were upheld on appeal and the national chapters were informed.","Discipline against Phi Kappa Psi and Sigma Chi .

"This could be considered his latest 'Shaq attack.' Retired NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal, 42, has officially become  a reserve police officer for the Doral Police Department in South Florida. The former Miami Heat player was sworn in at a special ceremony on Tuesday by Doral Police Chief Donald De Lucca.

Height: The 7ft star, center, towers over Doral Police Chief Donald De Lucca, right, and Mayor Luigi Borra left . Ceremony: Doral Police Chief Donald De Lucca, left, and Mayor Luigi Borra attend the ceremony for Shaq . The ceremony was attended by the Mayor of Doral Luigi Borra, the city attorney, city manager and City Council. But now that O' Neal has his badge, Doral Police Department is trying to figure out how they'll be able to make a uniform that's big enough to fit the star who is 7ft 1in tall and weighs 324-pounds. 'His shoe size is huge, but nobody knows the exact number,' senior executive assistant to the chief, Carlos Arango said chuckling. 'At some point we'll get him an official polo shirt, but for now he has his badge.' O' Neal had originally applied to become a member of Doral police in September. He went through the entire application process and submitted to a background check before he was taken on. But  he will not receive a salary and will cover his own insurance costs. According to the police department, O'Neal will commute to work from his homes in Fort Lauderdale and Orlando. Officer Shaq: Shaquille O'Neal, seen here, in his Port of Los Angeles Police Officer uniform is getting back into law enforcement as a reserve officer in Florida . Retired NBA player Shaquille O'Neal performs a DJ set at the Chateau Nightclub & Rooftop at the Paris Las Vegas last year, he has been a rapper, actor, reserve officer, reality television star, and DJ . De Lucca told The Miami Herald that Shaq will mostly be doing community work and serving as a role model for children. 'I want them to be be able to say: 'If Mr. O'Neal can do it, I can do it,' he told The Miami Herald. But it's not his first time the NBA legend has worked to protect and serve. He has previously served as a reserve police officer for Miami Beach and Golden Beach in Florida; in Tempe, Arizona; and the Port of Los Angeles. O'Neal has said that he considers police work to be his 'calling' and revealed that two of his uncles were police officers and his stepfather was an Army sergeant. Despite a glittering basketball career, he admits that he has been interested in law enforcement since he was a teenager. During Shaq's two-decade basketball career, he played in Orlando, Los Angeles, Miami, Phoenix, Cleveland and Boston. NBA highlights: While an NBA star O'Neal took home four coveted NBA championship rings . While in Miami, he traveled back and forth to Virginia, where he worked on the Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Force Program. And he admits that his long-term goal is to become a police chief or sheriff in Florida. He said: 'When it's all said and done, [I'd like to work in] either Orange County, Dade County or Broward. But, I have to work from the ground up first.' O'Neal, however, heaped praise on Doral's current Chief, who has served as police chief of Miami Beach and of Golden Beach while Shaq was a reserve officer. He said: 'He's a great leader. I'm learning from him, watching him. He's a good friend of mine, and in order to become a great leader, you have to master their style and then create your own style.' In return, De Lucca praised O' Neal saying: 'We're honored to have him as part of our team, he's a role model for today's youth; he believes in the nobility of our profession.'","The former Miami Heat star was sworn in as a reserve police officer Tuesday .

"Boy band heartthrob turned pop culture icon Justin Timberlake may be known for singing high notes but his Italian restaurant went out on a low note, revealed  a lawsuit against the establishment's insurance company filed on Tuesday in a Manhattan court. Justin Timberlake the former singer of N'Sync opened the New York Italian restaurant Destino with two business partners Eytan Sugarman and Trace Ayala in 2006 but the eatery was flooded twice with raw sewage due to bad plumbing, reportsThe New York Post. Scroll down for video . What a waste!: Justin Timberlake's popular Italian restaurant Destino's closed because of faulty sewage that caused human waste to leak from the walls twice, alleges a lawsuit filed on Tuesday . 'On any given night the dining room swelled with a mix of executives, neighborhood regulars and celebrities, all enjoying the superb food and drink,' Destino’s lawyer says in the case against Amguard Insurance Co. 'The Destino restaurant not only served great food, but had wonderful atmosphere,' said the filing. The restaurant was headed former Rao chef Mario Curko and was a celebrity hot spot in the heart of midtown Manhattan. The suit claims that in July 2013 illegal plumbing pipes burst above the restaurant which in turn caused human waste to leak down the walls forcing the bustling  restaurant to close. The lawsuit alleges that the insurance company pushed the restaurant to reopen in November 2013 when it wasn't yet ready. The suit says that a few days after the restaurant reopened a pipe fell on a stocked food area which spewed a mold infestation. The insurer denied Destino’s claims including a $275,000 bill for repair and company losses. It was previously known that the restaurant flooded but Tuesday's lawsuit revealed that the restaurant was soiled with sewage, a detail that may have been left out in case they ever decided to reopen for business. Timberlake along with his partners still own a restaurant in New York City called Southern Hospitality located in Manhattan's Hell's Kitchen area.

"President Barack Obama vowed in the State of the Union address Tuesday to relentlessly hunt down terrorists from 'Pakistan to the streets of Paris,' then called on Congress to approve new war powers against Islamic State militants. Obama argued that U.S military leadership in Iraq and Syria is stopping the Islamic State's advance, but asked lawmakers 'to show the world that we are united in this mission' with a vote to authorize war against the extremist group. Republican lawmakers have said they are prepared to work with him to pass such a measure if he sends a proposal up to Capitol Hill, and in their response to Obama's address, given by Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, they urged him to come up with a 'comprehensive' plan to defeat the group. President Barack Obama listens to applause as he arrives to deliver his State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington. In his speech Obama called on Congress to give his administration new powers to fight ISIS . Obama is pictured here shaking hands with outgoing Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, right, after his State of the Union address . Obama said America learned 'some costly lessons' in the fight against terrorism since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and they are guiding his approach to fight the Islamic State extremists. 'Instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East, we are leading a broad coalition, including Arab nations, to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group,' Obama said in remarks prepared for delivery. 'We're also supporting a moderate opposition in Syria that can help us in this effort, and assisting people everywhere who stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism. This effort will take time. It will require focus. But we will succeed.' Obama said he believes in moving forward with 'a smarter kind of American leadership' that combines military power with strong diplomacy. 'That's how America leads — not with bluster, but with persistent, steady resolve,' Obama said. 'When we make rash decisions, reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads, when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military, then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts and neglect the broader strategy we need for a safer, more prosperous world,' he said. 'That's what our enemies want us to do.' Obama said the United States stands in solidarity with people who have been targeted by terrorists, mentioning attacks in recent weeks on a school in Pakistan and across Paris. 'We will continue to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks, and we reserve the right to act unilaterally, as we've done relentlessly since I took office, to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies,' Obama said.","Obama asked lawmakers 'to show the world that we are united in this mission' with a vote to authorize war against the extremist group .

"It has been dubbed the 'sickest ever' video game because players only have one aim - to massacre as many people as possible in a 'genocide crusade'. Now, Killing-spree simulator, 'Hatred', has been given an adults only (AO) rating from ESRB, the video game ratings board in the US and Canada. Such a high rating is rare in the gaming industry, with 'M for Mature' far more common, and the only other game to receive an AO rating for violence is 'Manhunt 2'. Scroll down for video... Killing-spree simulator, 'Hatred', has been given an Adults Only (AO) rating from ESRB, the video game ratings board in the US and Canada. Hatred has been called the 'sickest ever' game and involves one man who wants to carry out a 'genocide crusade' because humans are 'worms and 'no life is worth saving' Despite its violence, the developers of Hatred are surprised by its rating, which is equivalent to the NC-17 rating among movies. 'Well, I'm not quite convinced why Hatred got AO rating while it lacks any sexual content,' said one developer on their forum. 'It's still some kind of achievement to have the second game in history getting AO rating for violence and harsh language only. 'Even if this violence isn't really that bad and this harsh language isn't overused.' 'Hatred' is the story of a lone wolf gunman who 'hates the world' and acts out his fantasy of brutally murdering the public and police because 'no life is worth saving'. Gamers are encouraged to murder everyone they see, including police officers (left) and the public (right) Fans took to Twitter comment on the rating, which may have encouraged more young people to play the game . The hooded killer uses machine guns, knives and explosives to kill in the streets, in schools and public buildings because of his 'bitter hatred' of 'human worms'. In the game, Manhunt 2, players take the role of a patient who has escaped from an asylum . The only other game to receive an AO rating for violence is 'Manhunt 2'. In the game, players take the role of a patient who has escaped from an asylum after an experiment at a secret research facility goes wrong. Players can perform 'executions' either hasty, violent or gruesome on 'enemies' such as the police and armed forces employed by the project. It was developed by Rockstar London for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 2, Rockstar Leeds for the PlayStation Portable, and Rockstar Toronto for the Wii. After its release he ESRB felt that Manhunt 2 was so violent that it took the extraordinary step of giving a game an AO rating for violent content . The title, which has been developed by Polish company Destructive Creations, was initially banned from marketplace Steam - but later reinstated after complaints from gamers. Footage from its trailer shows the main character killing indiscriminately with a number of different weapons - and it ends with the line 'death is coming in 2015'. The character says as he prepares to start the massacre: 'I just hate this world and the human worms feasting on its carcass. 'My whole life is just cold, bitter hatred, and I always wanted to die violently. This the time for vengeance and no life is worth saving - and I will put in a grave as many as I can. 'It's time for me to kill and time for me to die. My genocide crusade'. The description of the game reads: 'Hatred fills your whole body. You're sick and tired of humanity's worthless existence. 'The only thing that matters is your gun and pure Armageddon that you want to unleash. 'You will go out for a hunt, you will clear the American soil of humans with cold blood. 'You will shoot, you will hurt, you will kill, you will die. 'There are no rules, no compassion, no mercy, no point of going back. You are the lord of life and death now and you have the full control over life's of worthless human scum. 'You will also run, you will need to think, you will need to hide and fight back when armoured forces will come to take you down. 'You will have no mercy for them, because they dare to come in your way. 'Only brutality and destruction can clear this land. Only the killing spree will make you die spectacularly and go to hell.' Horrifying: In one scene in the trailer the gunman opens fire in a public library killing everyone inside . The initial trailer for the horrifying game shows the unnamed protagonist strolling around a city with a machine gun, performing a series of gruesome executions on innocent civilians. At one point, an Asian lady screams for mercy just before she is shot in the head at point blank range, while another slaying sees a police officer have his head blown off with a shotgun. The game was initially banned by Steam, because the violence was too graphic and unjustified, but not before it had received a horrifying 14,000 'likes.' Steam is a digital game shop for platforms including Windows, Mac and Linux. But in December, Steam boss Gabe Newell reinstated the controversial game, and it has since gathered an additional 27,000 'likes'. Developer Destructive Creations said: 'This is the best proof for us that there are diehard Hatred fans out there, waiting for this game to be released. 'And that we need to keep going to deliver them a game that offers exciting and challenging gameplay. 'The whole situation only pushes us forward to go against any adversity and not to give up. 'It also makes us want to provide our fans Hatred pre-orders sooner, as many of you have asked for them. 'At the end of the day you, gamers will judge if we were able to do a game that's simply fun to play.' Thousands of gamers have already commented on Hatred, slamming the graphic portrayal of violence. Grim: It also shows the aftermath of one of the killing sprees with bodies strewn every where . Response: But other gamers say that it should be banned calling it 'wrong' and 'distasteful' They say that controversial games like Grand Theft Auto do allow people to kill, but players  can also choose to do other things. One said: 'This is the sickest game ever. It's basically spree-killing - like Columbine, Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook and Dunblane. 'Whoever wants to play this needs their head examined.' Youtuber 'O Canal BP' wrote: 'This is wrong. Yes I run over and shoot people on Grand Theft Auto, but that's optional. 'This is not optional - you have got to kill a bunch of innocent people because the main character is on a suicide mission.' Another gamer added: 'The fact that anyone would want this monstrosity to exist is astounding to me. 'The fact that a few thousand people said yes to it is mind-numbing. 'What kind of sick people live in this world, who would make and enjoy a game about violently murdering civilians?' Player 'Tapport' said: 'In my opinion this game is really distasteful and serves no propose to gaming but at the same time I think people should be able to play what they want. 'I can guarantee one thing though, next mass shooting in the US by someone who has ever touched a video game is getting blamed on this game. Probably even someone who hasn't.' Yet many others support the game, including player MuscularYoda, who wrote: 'This game does not go far enough.'","High rating is rare in the industry and developers have expressed surprise .

"President Barack Obama will use his State of the Union address tonight to push tax increases he knows the GOP-led Congress will never pass, let alone consider. He plans to put Republicans on the defense by characterizing them as the party of big business and special interests while pushing Democrats are the true champions of the middle class. Although Obama has competed in his last election, his party must be able to show that if trusted with the White House and the Senate again, it will advocate for a platform of reforms that will be a boon to average Americans. President Barack Obama will use his State of the Union address to push tax increases he knows the GOP-led Congress will never pass, let alone consider . Obama is pictured here giving the 2014 State of the Union address. Tonight he will give the first of two final speeches before a joint session of Congress . With just two years left in office, Obama is running out of time to build his legacy, which includes digging his political party out of the rut it's in. On his watch, Democrats ceded the speaker's gavel to the GOP after a  blow out election in 2010 that followed a major effort, spearheaded by the White House, to substantially reform the nation's health care system. Democrats managed to stop the bleeding two years later, keeping both the Senate and the White House in the 2012 election. But the bandaging was only temporary, and in November, Republicans seized the upper chamber and expanded their majority in the House to a size not seen since the last World War. While Democrats were defending the president's health care law and forthcoming immigration actions, Republicans were successfully arguing that they would pass a slew of jobs bills targeted at the middle class if propelled to power. And since taking office, they've lined up a series of votes intended to embarrass Democrats and force them into politically uncomfortable positions, including a vote to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which Republicans and the makers of the conduit claim will create north of 42,000 jobs a year. The GOP has also seized on several opportunities to amend the president's health law, Obamacare, one of which even received the backing of the White House. That measure exempted veterans who already have health care through the government from being counted toward the number of workers that qualify for employer-sponsored health insurance. For small businesses on the cusp of exceeding 50 workers, the point at which the employer mandate takes effect, the measure could serve as an incentive to bring on unemployed veterans of the armed services. Unwilling to explain their opposition to legislation that would encourage businesses to 'hire more heroes,' Democrats and the White House threw their support behind the bill this month. The White House hopes to turn the tables on Republicans during tonight's State of the Union address and make full use of the age-old adage that the GOP cares more about the millionaires and billionaires of the country than it does middle class families.

Although Obama has competed in his last election, his party must be able to show that if trusted with the White House and the Senate again, it will advocate for a platform of reforms that will be a boon to average Americans - something Obama plans to lay the groundwork for tonight in his address at the U.S. Capitol, pictured here early this morning. The government hub is currently under renovation . Obama will tap into that sentiment by proposing $320 billion in tax increases over the next 10 years to pay for everything from community college for hard-working high school students to tax credits for couples earning a combined income of up to $210,000 - all of which he will detail in full in his annual budget, due to come out Feb. 2 this year. The two main revenue increases included in Obama's plan would affect banks with more than $50 billion in assets, roughly 100 institutions in America, and a tax increase would affect married couples earning more than $500,000 a year. The suggested fee on big banks is meant to discourage financial institutions from engaging in the risky behaviors that led to the 2008 crash, the White House says. New taxes on the 1 percent would make up the bulk of the cash the federal government would need to fund Obama's favored programs. Obama wants to raise high-income earners' capital gains tax to 28 percent from 20 percent and eliminate a tax loophole that allows the wealth to avoid paying fees to the government on their inheritances. Dubbed the 'Robin Hood tax,' Republicans have already declared the measure dead on arrival. 'This is not a serious proposal,' Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, told the Washington Post. 'We lift families up and grow the economy with a simpler, flatter tax code, not big tax increases to pay for more Washington spending.' In a speech at the Chamber of Commerce this morning, Sen. Orrin Hatch, Chairman of the Senate' Finance Committee, accused Obama of attempting to incite 'class warfare.' Hatch has set his sights on reforming the tax code. Obama's plan 'appears to be more about redistribution,' he said, per The Hill, which 'is unfortunate, because we’re going to need real leadership from the White House - not just liberal talking points - if tax reform is going to be successful.' The proposals aren't meant to thrill Republicans. If anything, Obama's speech is meant to incite the opposing party and show them that the White House has no intention of giving up any ground, regardless of the walloping its party received in the last election. Obama was elected to the bully pulpit for an eight-year term, and he plans to use it, White House officials have asserted. 'The president’s going to take this opportunity to make the case directly to the American people why we can, and in fact need to, move forward on an agenda like this,' a senior administration official told reporters during a call previewing the State of the Union. 'We are hopeful that what we will see is a positive response, particularly from those who have championed similar ideas in the past,' the official added, according to Politico. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said today based on previews of Obama's speech, the president misinterpreted the results of the midterm elections. 'The American people aren’t demanding talking-point proposals designed to excite the base but not designed to pass,' McConnell said in a speech before the Senate today. 'What they said they’re hungry for is substance and accomplishment. They want Washington to get back to work and focus on a serious jobs and reform agenda. They said they’re ready to see more constructive cooperation, especially on bipartisan jobs initiatives,' he said, name-checking the Keystone pipeline, which the Senate will take a series of votes on today. Obama has said he would veto Keystone legislation if it passes both chambers of Congress. The House has already OK'd the project. Not with enough votes to override the the president, though. The bill survived a procedural vote in the Senate last week, and it's expected to pass with slightly fewer votes than necessary to nullify an executive action snuffing it out. McConnell said today the legislation 'will be on the president’s desk before long. We see no reason for him to veto these jobs. 'But whatever he decides, we’re going to keep working for positive, middle-class jobs ideas here in Congress. As I’ve said before, we’re not here to protect the president from a good idea. 'And if the president’s willing to work with us, there’s much we can get accomplished for the American people,' he added. Senate Republicans have more to lose heading into the next election cycle than the president or his party, though, and Obama's gamble could pay off. In 2014 just 10 GOP senators were on the ballot. In less than two years Republicans will have to defend 24 seats, including several  in states that Obama won in the last election. And if Marco Rubio makes a bid for the presidency, they'll have to find someone to run in his stead in the swing state that often decides national elections. The Florida senator has said he won't compete for reelection and higher office at the same time. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul may also find himself in a bind in 2016 as his state's election laws do not allow politicians to appear on the ballot twice for two separate positions. Paul's Senate seat is also up for reelction in two years and he is likely to run for president.","Will try to force Republicans on the defense by characterizing them as the party of big business and Democrats as champions of the middle class .

"Yemeni rebels have seized the country's presidential palace and attacked the US-backed leader's official residence in what is being described by one top military leader as a 'coup'. President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi was inside his official residence as it came under 'heavy shelling' for half-an-hour on Tuesday. At the same time, the powerful Shiite Houthi rebels seized the presidential palace in the capital, Sanaa, looting the arms depot in the grounds. Hadi was unharmed in the attack, which came five months after the rebels first swept into Sanaa. Colonel Saleh al-Jamalani, the commander of the Presidential Protection Force that guards the palace, said: 'This is a coup. There is no other word to describe what is happening but a coup.' Houthi rebels attacked Yemen's presidential palace at the same time as bombarding leader Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi's offical residence . Violence had broken out in the capital Sanaa the day before. Pictured: A guards post overlooking the presidential palace . The Houthi rebels took control of the capital back in September, and analysts say they are now 'finishing what they started' Colonel al-Jamalani added the rebels were most likely helped by insiders. The attack came after apparently unsuccessful talks between the two sides at Haidi's official residence that morning - a day after violence tore through the city. It is understood the meeting was to discuss the release of Ahmed bin Mubarak - the president's top aide, kidnapped after Hadi allegedly breached a UN-brokered peace deal. In return for his release, the Houthis were asking for changes in constitution and national authority. On Monday, the Houthis had seized control of state media in Sanaa, clashing with soldiers near the presidential palace. The Houthis and Hadi's forces have blamed each other for the outbreak of violence, which left at least nine people dead and 67 wounded, Yemen's deputy health minister Nasser Baoum said. On Tuesday, Houthi fighters were on the streets, travelling in pickup trucks mounted with anti-aircraft guns, while manning checkpoints across the capital - including near the prime minister's residence and the intelligence headquarters. Information Minister Nadia al-Sakkaf posted on her Twitter account that the shelling started at 3pm local time 'by armed forces positioned over rooftops facing' the president's house. The Houthi rebels had clashed with soldiers in the city on Monday (pictured) after taking control of the state's media . The fighting was so intense people were forced to flee the street. Pictured: A woman walks among the debris . Yemenis inspects the damage near the presidential palace on Tuesday, after Monday's violence . Yemeni analysts say the attacks - which have long been expected - are only the Houthis 'finishing the job' they began in September. Abdel-Bari Taher, a veteran Yemeni journalist and writer, said: 'What is happening now is just one more step toward (the Houthis') consolidation of power.' But the Houthis' television network al-Masseria claimed the attack came after rebels intercepted and foiled attempts by an unspecified group to loot weapons from the presidential palace. The rebels were out in force on the streets of the capital on Tuesday morning . Fighters had set up check points at key points around the city - including near the prime minister's residence . In New York, the UN Security Council held an emergency meeting over the chaos in Sanaa. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed concern over the 'deteriorating situation' in Yemen and urged all sides to cease hostilities. According to CNN, two U.S. navy warships moved  into the area to help evacuate Americans from the embassy if needs be. The weakening of Hadi, a top US ally, also undermines efforts by America and its allies to battle al-Qaida's Yemeni affiliate, Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, which claimed responsibility for the Charlie Hebdo massacre earlier this month. Houthi fighters are thought to have their eye on expanding power into central Yemen . But Yemeni soldiers were also out on the streets, protecting the palace and the president . Dr Charles Schmitz, a specialist in Yemen, doesn't think a change of government should have too big an impact on American efforts in the country. 'The Houthi portray themselves as ""authentically"" Yemeni,' he explained. 'They criticise the government for being beholden to foreigners. 'On the other hand, they have done absolutely to offend the Americans, and the embassy is keeping its doors open to any future ruling party.' However, more worrying is if the Houthi - whose traditional stronghold is in the north - decide to expand out of the capital into east Yemen, where Sunni tribesmen dominate. If that were to happen, Dr Schmitz warns, a 'bloody civil war' would most likely ensue. Others feel Al-Qaida in Yemen, which has waged deadly attacks targeting both the Houthis and Hadi's forces, stands to benefit. The Houthis are also seen by their critics as a proxy of Shiite Iran and are believed to be allied with former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who ruled Yemen for more than three decades before he was ousted in 2012 after Arab Spring protests. The rebels deny any Iran links. Suspected al-Qaida militants on Tuesday tried to assassinate a top army commander in the southern Hadramawt province, killing five of his guards in the attack, military officials said. The militants set off explosives, hurling them at the commander's convoy, then opened gunfire but the commander managed to escape unharmed, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to media.","President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi was unharmed in half-hour assault .

"The Muslim kosher supermarket employee who saved several shoppers lives during the Paris attack has been granted French citizenship. Lassana Bathily, 24, was praised for his 'courage and heroism' by Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve during a ceremony in the presence of Prime Minister Manuel Valls. Mr Cazeneuve said Mali-born Bathily's 'act of humanity has become a symbol of an Islam of peace and tolerance.' Scroll down for video . Selfless: When gunman Amedy Coulibaly entered the shop, Lassana Bathily turned off the freezer and hid shoppers inside before sneaking out and helping police free the hostages . Hero: Shop clerk Lassana Bathily who guided six shoppers to safety during the attack on the Paris Kosher grocery where he was working, has been granted French citizenship . Proud moment: French Prime Minister Manuel Valls, left, and French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, center, award citizenship to Lassana Bathily during a ceremony  in Paris . 'Tonight I'm very proud and deeply touched,' Mr Bathily, who went to school in Paris, said with tears in his eyes. He humbly stressed that he does not consider himself a hero, saying: 'I am Lassana. I'll stay true to myself.' 'People are all equal to me and skin color isn't a matter. France is the country of human rights,' he added. Mr Bathily was in the store's underground stockroom when gunman Amedy Coulibaly burst in to the Hyper Cacher supermarket in Porte de Vincennes, Paris, on January 9 and killed four people. The 24-year-old guided terrified customers to safety in a supermarket chiller and has since been praised around the world for his quick-thinking and bravery.

"Victim: Dr. Michael Davidson is currently in a 'life threatening condition' after the shooting on Tuesday morning . The cardiologist shot twice and critically injured by a gunman at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital on Tuesday morning had treated the shooter's mother before she passed away. Stephen Pasceri, 55, appeared to deliberately target heart surgeon Dr. Michael Davidson and asked for the doctor at the desk of the world renowned hospital's heart unit before opening fire. Pasceri, who is married and has children and is reported to be a resident of Milbury, Massachusetts, then turned the gun on himself in an examination room afterwards and ended his life. According to WCVB, Pasceri was licensed to carry a gun and police have said that his family had no idea he would ever have planned to commit murder. One of Pasceri's friends said to WHDH the family 'are in shock and say he was the nicest guy.' His mother, Marguerite Pasceri, died on November 15, 2014 and was reportedly treated at one point by the cardiologist who is also an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School. Her obituary wrote that she 'died surrounded by the family she had loved so much in life. A light has gone from the world that can never be replaced.' In the same obituary, it added that she will be deeply missed by her children, Stephen, Angela, Matthew, Andrew and Rebecca. The Massachusetts Public Notices advisory states that Stephen Pasceri was also the executor of his mother’s will and estate. Scroll down for video . Response: Boston Police Superintendent-in-Chief William Gross, (center left), walks through a revolving door as he departs the Shapiro building at Brigham and Women's Hospital on Tuesday after the shooting . The suspect entered Brigham and Women's Hospital, affiliated with Harvard Medical School, sometime before 11 a.m. Tuesday and requested the doctor by name, Boston Police Commissioner William Evans said. Evans says police were on the scene at Brigham and Women's Hospital within seconds after getting the first calls of the shooting. Officers conducting a room-by-room search found the Pasceri dead of a self-inflicted wound in an examination room. His gun was also found. Evans did not disclose a motive but said earlier on Tuesday afternoon that Pasceri wasn't a patient of the doctor. Earlier Boston police had mistakenly tweeted that Pasceri had been apprehended and was in custody. Evacuation: Medical personnel walk past law enforcement officials, (right), as they depart the Shapiro building after the cardiologist was shot and critically wounded . Security: The hospital has a well-drilled evacuation procedure for an active shooter situation and put that plan into action on Tuesday . Global reputation: Brigham and Women's in Boston is world renowned for its emergency surgeries and facial reconstructions . The shooting occurred in the Carl J. and Ruth Shapiro Cardiovascular Center on the second floor, inside another examination room. 'The shooter came into the hospital asking for this particular doctor,' Boston Police Commissioner William Evans said. 'We don't know why. That's something we're looking into.' 'There is something in the past that upset this guy to come in looking for this particular doctor,' added Evans to reporters at the press conference. 'They found who we believe to be the suspect inside an examining room with what appeared to be at this time clearly a self-inflicted gunshot wound,' Evans said. Brigham and Women's Hospital president Dr. Betsy Nable said earlier onTuesday afternoon they would not be providing information on the doctor's identity, but said his injuries were life threatening. Commissioner Evans said that because the doctor was surrounded by colleagues medical help was administered immediately. Crime scene: Boston Police officers, including Commissioner William Evans (C), work inside the building where a shooting occurred at Brigham and Women's hospital in Boston, Massachusetts . 'We are looking at a possible motive. We know (the gunman) came into the hospital on the second floor looking for this particular doctor. There was a reason he targeted this doctor,' Evans said according to WMUR.Com. 'Our prayers go out to the doctor's wife,' Evans said. Police have said the situation was declared resolved at around 11.54am, but earlier there was a confusing situation. 'There has been a shooting in the Shapiro building, and the suspect has been apprehended. The Shapiro center has been locked down, and all staff are asked to remain in place,' the hospital said in a statement. One witness said that the Shapiro building had been placed on lockdown and dozens of emergency vehicles had arrived on the scene. 'Once we were clear of the waiting room, there were police officers with their weapons drawn yelling, 'Get down! Get down,'' said one man to WCVB. Hospital employees are well-drilled for the nightmare scenario of a shooter inside the building. In November 2013, doctors and nurses and other staff at the world-famous institution underwent training for an active shooter situation and viewed a video for a so-called 'Code Silver' event. 'I am extremely proud of the way our staff responded,' said hospital president Dr. Elizabeth Nabel according to the Boston Globe.

"British soldiers cleared by UK courts of unlawfully killing Iraqi citizens face the ordeal of war crimes trials in the Hague. Prosecutors at the International Criminal Court, which usually tries dictators who carry out genocide, have refused to grant the troops immunity from the possibility of fresh charges. In a letter, the ICC warned it was ‘unable to provide assurances’ that the soldiers would not be hauled before another judge. British soldiers cleared by UK courts of unlawfully killing Iraqi citizens face the ordeal of war crimes trials in the Hague . Eight servicemen acquitted a decade ago of murdering two Iraqis ‘fall within the scope’ of a fresh inquiry into claims UK forces tortured and abused prisoners, it said. The ICC announced last May it had launched a ‘preliminary examination’ into claims of mistreatment by UK troops after being handed a dossier by Phil Shiner’s Public Interest Lawyers. The legal aid-funded firm was criticised last month after the year-long Al Sweady Inquiry demolished its claims that soldiers murdered, tortured and mutilated Iraqi detainees in May 2004. The latest twist provoked outrage that soldiers were being hounded by international authorities. The ICC’s letter was sent to Sir George Newman, chairman of an ongoing inquiry in London into the deaths of Naheem Abdullah, who died of injuries sustained at a road block in Maysan Province in May 2003, and Hassan Said, shot dead in August 2003. Seven paratroopers were cleared of murdering Mr Abdullah in 2005. In a separate case, one soldier was acquitted of murdering Mr Said after the court ruled he acted in self-defence. The new development raises the prospect of the troops facing a second trial in the Hague. Colonel Richard Kemp, who commanded British forces in Afghanistan, said the uncertainty was ‘despicable’. Prosecutors at the International Criminal Court (pictured), which usually tries dictators who carry out genocide, have refused to grant the troops immunity from the possibility of fresh charges . He said: ‘It is an outrage that soldiers who we sent to fight for our country should face even the possibility of trial by the ICC. ‘The British government ordered them to fight in Iraq. British courts have tried and cleared them of any alleged offence. ‘These men and their families have already suffered more than enough stress. ‘For the government to allow brave men who have volunteered to put their lives on the line to be hounded in this way is a national disgrace and a betrayal.’ Colonel Tim Collins, acclaimed for his rousing eve-of-battle speech in the Iraq War, said: ‘This is a failure by the UK to simply put its best efforts into supporting its soldiers and represents a very poor show. ‘Often these right-on courts are quick to point fingers from very vulnerable glass houses.’ The ICC’s examination into claims of abuse by UK troops is the first time it has investigated Britain for alleged war crimes. The Government has said the UK would cooperate fully in any ICC investigation but ‘completely rejected’ the claim that UK forces were responsible for systematic abuse.","Prosecutors at International Criminal Court refuse to grant troops immunity from possibility of new charges .

"A 2-year-old boy has been struck and killed by a train in southeast Kentucky after he wandered away from his house and out on the tracks with his dog. Trayton Joiner lived in a house just behind the railroad tracks in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. 'He was three months shy of his third birthday,' Hopkinsiville police spokesman Paul Ray said. The CSX train conductor saw the toddler on the tracks and blew his whistle and slammed on the brakes, but could not stop before he hit  the little boy - as well as his dog. Scroll down for video . A CSX train, like the one pictured, struck and killed a 2-year-old toddler who wandered onto the tracks on Monday in Hopkinsville, Kentucky . Investigators are still trying to determine why the boy was on his own on the train tracks - and was not being supervised . Neighbors told WTVF that the boy slipped out of the house when his grandmother fell asleep. Police are investigating the incident and have questioned the family about why the toddler was allowed outside alone. The dog that was with Trayton, a pit bull mix, had an injured back but was taken to a veterinary clinic and is expected to recover. Neighbors were shocked that the boy was on the tracks by himself. Trains are a regular fixture in the neighborhood, passing through several days a day at all hours. 'It was heartbreaking to know that a child that young will be wandering around the tracks, but at the same time, someone should have been there to protect him,' neighbor Carolyn Forest told WSMV-TV. Some neighbors said CSX needs to put up a fence around the tracks running through town to prevent children from wandering onto the tracks.

"The widow of Chris Kyle, the SEAL subject of the blockbuster American Sniper, is scaling back her public appearances to promote the film following backlash. Taya Kyle was cutting back on interviews following criticism from filmmaker Michael Moore and others, The Star Tribune reported. The movie, starring Bradley Cooper as Kyle, Sienna Miller as his wife and directed by Clint Eastwood, has already earned $90.2million at the box office, setting a record for the highest-earning January opening. Scroll down for video . Taya Kyle (pictured with Bradley Cooper to the right, last week) widow of 'American Sniper' Chris Kyle, has curtailed her media appearances following criticism of the movie about her husband which broke box office records . Mrs Kyle with her husband Chris Kyle before his death in 2013. His best-selling autobiography American Sniper has been turned into a Hollywood blockbuster tipped for Oscar success . The film tells the story of Mr Kyle, a sniper, who was credited with saving hundreds of American lives by making 160 confirmed kills,  the most in U.S. military history. After retiring from the military, Kyle was shot dead at a gun range in Texas in 2013 by a soldier he was trying to help who was suffering from severe PTSD. Despite the box office success and Oscar buzz, the subject matter of American Sniper has drawn critics including director Michael Moore, who tweeted on Sunday: 'My uncle was killed by a sniper in WWII. Only cowards would do that 2 him, others.' The filmmaker later backtracked after an onslaught of criticism. Moore claimed on Monday that he was not talking about either Kyle or the film, pointing out the fact that he didn't mention either directly. 'Hmm. I never tweeted 1word bout AmericaSniper/ChrisKyle. I said my uncle killed by sniper in WWII; only cowards would do that 2 him, others,' Moore said. One of those who strongly criticized Moore was Medal of Honor recipient Dakota Meyer, Fox reported. Meyer, a Marine vet who was awarded the medal for his bravery during the Battle of Ganjga in Afghanistan, said of Moore: 'I'm sure that his grandfather who died serving this country is rolling over in his grave knowing that his grandson is using him to justify him calling U.S. service men cowards. 'I’d be willing to bet that at some point during his grandfather’s service, he was watched over by U.S. snipers, and probably had his life saved more than once by U.S. snipers during the war.' Chris Kyle, who was credited with saving hundreds of American lives by making 160 confirmed kills, which is the most in American military history, before his death in 2013 . However, despite the film's defenders, it appears that representatives for Mrs Kyle and the movie were somewhat squeamish about putting her in front of the press. The co-chair of a St Louis synagogue speaking event told The Star Tribune that Mrs Kyle's reps 'are cutting off her press. They will allow us to schedule some interviews but only related to promoting our event'. She added: 'Because of this, any questions related to the current murder trial [involving the disturbed U.S. veteran who killed Kyle] and the Ventura trial are off the table.' The email referred to the defamation lawsuit brought last year by former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura against Kyle's autobiography. Ventura was awarded $1.8 million in July. A federal jury decided that the 2012 best-seller written by Kyle defamed Ventura in its description of a bar fight in California in 2006. Kyle wrote that he decked a man whom he later identified as Ventura after the man allegedly said the Navy SEALs 'deserve to lose a few'. The case is currently on appeal to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Kyle's killer, U.S. Marine Corps vet, Eddie Ray Routh, is set to stand trial in February. Filmmaker Michael Moore appeared to criticize the movie and Kyle in a tweet on Sunday - but later backtracked on his remarks . Earlier this week, Mrs Kyle paid tribute to audiences who have flocked to cinemas to watch the film. Taya Kyle has thanked movie-goers for 'being willing to watch the hard stuff' in the war drama and says she often cries thinking about the support she has received. With the film of his life tipped for Oscar success, Mrs Kyle, had thanked audiences in a post on Facebook. She wrote: 'I am overwhelmed with gratitude and my heart is full. American Sniper has broken records, which follows such an honest path of Chris's life. 'We never expected anything and were always in a moment of stunned silence at the response from all the beautiful people in this world. 'I also just want to cry and cry and honestly have today. I think that's what happens when I don't have the words. The only thing I can say is thank you. Thank you for the love and support of our military. 'Thank you for being willing to watch the hard stuff and thank you for hearing, seeing, experiencing the life of our military and first responders. 'I put them together because the battlefields may be different but the experience is the same on many spiritual levels.' The film, which is based on Mr Kyle's autobiography of the same name reveals not only how he became so successful, but also how the trauma of fighting in Iraq never left him. In the post she also gave an emotional tribute to her late husband and admitted that she still misses him every day. She added: 'To Chris: I miss you and yet I know you are here. 'You are the man who I couldn't have even dreamt of because you were/are better than I could have dreamed, the love of my life, my friend, partner and the man who laughed with me through the pain and found joy in the smallest and best parts of life. 'I hope you see the love and good we will do together in whatever God has planned for the rest of the journey. Thank you for loving me. 'You are with me and I love you is all I can say. I can only say it simply, because there aren't words enough to express it all.' The film tells the story of her husband who was raised in rural Texas and started out working as a cowboy. He applied to join the SEALs but was turned down because a rodeo accident had left him with metal pins in his arms. However, in the late Nineties, the unit relaxed its entrance requirements and Kyle was put through the fearsomely tough selection and training regime. In 2003, he was deployed to Iraq where he made his first long-distance kills even though he had not been trained as sniper. Spotting his obvious talent, the military sent him to SEAL sniper school, where he was taught how to perform warfare's loneliest and most controversial job. In 2004, Kyle was posted to Fallujah, west of Baghdad and a major battleground of Iraqi insurgency, and it was during the battle for that city where he first made his mark. However, it was in 2006 in Ramadi, a city in central Iraq, that Mr Kyle gained his nickname as 'The Legend' from his fellow SEALs. One day, while positioned on a roof, Kyle watched a moped coming down a street. Riding it were two men, one of whom dropped a backpack into a pothole. Realising that it contained an improvised explosive, Kyle took a shot at the speeding moped from a range of 150 yards. The bullet hit one of the riders, passed through him, and hit the other. In 2009, after four tours of Iraq, Kyle retired. He had not only shot more of the enemy than any other American sniper but had also gained himself a chestful of medals, including three Silver Stars for gallantry. In February 2013 he and a friend, Chad Littlefield, took 25-year old Eddie Ray Routh to a remote shooting range in Glen Rose, Texas. Before they reached the range Routh, 25, shot both men dead and stole Kyle's customized pick up truck. Routh's family claimed he was suffering from PTSD and had mental issues. His trial on two murder charges begins in February.","Taya Kyle, widow of Chris Kyle, is cutting back on interviews following criticism about the blockbuster movie .

"Two former professional wrestlers accuse the WWE of 'selling violence' while ignoring concussions that they say left them with serious brain injuries. The men, including one who performed under the name Skull Von Krush, have filed a potential class-action lawsuit in federal court in Philadelphia that echoes thousands of suits pending against the NFL. The NFL litigation, pending in the same courthouse, could yield a $1 billion settlement if a judge approves the proposed deal. The WWE plaintiffs are 50-year-old Vito LoGrasso of Coatesville and 22-year-old Evan Singleton of Lancaster. Skull Von Crush: Vito LoGrasso who went by the name Skull Von Krush claims he suffers from migraines, memory loss, depression and deafness after nearly a decade with the WWE . Adam Mercer: 22-year-old Evan Singleton of Lancaster who went by the name Adam Mercer is now disabled because of brain trauma he suffered early in his career . 'Under the guise of providing entertainment, the WWE has, for decades, subjected its wrestlers to extreme physical brutality that it knew, or should have known, caused created latent conditions and long-term irreversible bodily damage, including brain damage,' the lawsuit said. The lawsuit said that Singleton, who performed under the name Adam Mercer from 2012 to 2013, is now disabled because of brain trauma he suffered early in his career, which began at 19. LoGrasso suffers from migraines, memory loss, depression and deafness after nearly a decade with the WWE, the lawsuit said. His various stage names included Skull Von Krush and Big Vito. The Stamford, Connecticut-based company, led by Chairman and CEO Vince McMahon, planned to comment later on Tuesday. The suit describes some of the more dramatic tricks performed by WWE wrestlers, including the flying head butt and the chair shot, which involves striking a performer in the head with a folding chair. 'Sold Violence': World Wrestling Entertainment owner Vince McMahon raises his arm in the air to the audience during a fan appreciation event . 'When performed by, and on, hulking, poorly trained ... wrestlers with various levels of dexterousness, they (the tricks) are a recipe for disaster — and widespread, long-term brain damage,' said the lawsuit, filed by lawyers Harris L. Pogust of suburban Philadelphia and Charles J. LaDuca of Bethesda, Maryland. The lawsuit accuses the WWE of downplaying the seriousness of head injuries suffered in the ring and discouraging Singleton from seeing a neurologist. The plaintiffs also allege that two WWE performers were found after their deaths to have the brain decay known as CTE, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and that 13 current or former performers committed suicide over 10 years. The suit seeks unspecified economic damages and medical monitoring. The NFL expects about 6,000 former players to develop Alzheimer's disease or moderate dementia in the coming decades. Their awards could reach $3 million to $5 million but would likely average $190,000 given their age and condition.

"Scientists have found extraterrestrial dust at the bottom of the Earth's ocean. Thought to be from supernovae, it has settled on ocean floors. Researchers say analysing it could help to determine the amount of heavy elements created by the massive explosions. The so-called Crab Nebula emerged about 1,000 years ago through a star's supernova explosion: Researchers have found extraterrestrial dust at the bottom of the Earth's ocean and say it could help explain the phenomenon. The team analysed a 10 centimetre-thick sample of the earth's crust, representing 25 million years of accretion, as well as deep-sea sediments collected from a very stable area at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. They found 100 times less plutonium-244 than expected. The fact that these heavy elements like plutonium were present, and uranium and thorium are still present on earth suggests that such an explosive event must have happened close to the earth around the time it formed . 'Small amounts of debris from these distant explosions fall on the earth as it travels through the galaxy,' said lead researcher Dr Anton Wallner, from the Research School of Physics and Engineering. 'We've analysed galactic dust from the last 25 million years that has settled on the ocean and found there is much less of the heavy elements such as plutonium and uranium than we expected.' The findings are at odds with current theories of supernovae, in which some of the materials essential for human life, such as iron, potassium and iodine are created and distributed throughout space. Supernovae also create lead, silver and gold, and heavier radioactive elements such as uranium and plutonium. Dr Wallner's team studied plutonium-244 which serves as a radioactive clock by the nature of its radioactive decay, with a half-life of 81 million years. 'Any plutonium-244 that existed when the earth formed from intergalactic gas and dust over four billion years ago has long since decayed,' Dr Wallner said. 'So any plutonium-244 that we find on earth must have been created in explosive events that have occurred more recently, in the last few hundred million years.' The team analysed a 10 centimetre-thick sample of the earth's crust, representing 25 million years of accretion, as well as deep-sea sediments collected from a very stable area at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. The team analysed a  sample of the earth's crust (pictured), representing 25 million years of accretion, as well as deep-sea sediments collected from a very stable area at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. 'We found 100 times less plutonium-244 than we expected,' Dr Wallner said. 'It seems that these heaviest elements may not be formed in standard supernovae after all. 'It may require rarer and more explosive events such as the merging of two neutron stars to make them.' The fact that these heavy elements like plutonium were present, and uranium and thorium are still present on earth suggests that such an explosive event must have happened close to the earth around the time it formed, said Dr Wallner. 'Radioactive elements in our planet such as uranium and thorium provide much of the heat that drives continental movement, perhaps other planets don't have the same heat engine inside them,' he said. A supernova is a stellar explosion that briefly outshines an entire galaxy, radiating as much energy as the Sun or any ordinary star is expected to emit over its entire life span, before fading from view over several weeks or months. A supernova sends titanic shock waves rumbling through interstellar space. It leaves behind an ultra-dense neutron star in its wake, which spews out a blizzard of high-energy particles.","Analysed 10 centimetre-thick sample from the bottom of the Pacific Ocean .

"It sounds like the storyline for an episode of the Simpsons – tearaway Bart goes metal detecting and causes chaos when he brings home an unexploded bomb. But that is just what his namesake did when he went hunting for treasure near his home. Bartholomew Simpson, 37, unwittingly came across the Second World War relic encased in mud in while metal detecting in woodland in Benfleet. Scroll down for video . Bartholomew Simpson, 37, had to call the police after finding an unexploded bomb in woodland in Benfleet . Mr Simpson was not sure police would take his call seriously, suspecting they might suspect it was a prank . But It was not until he got back to his home in Essex and washed his haul that he discovered the live cannon shell and called the police. He said: 'I didn’t know how they would react to a guy phoning to say ""Hi, I’m Bart Simpson and I’ve found an explosive"". 'The funny thing is I’m not even a fan of The Simpsons.' Police evacuated Mr Simpson's neighbours in Laindon at 11pm on Sunday and an Army bomb disposal unit was called in. He said: ‘I don’t think my neighbours were very impressed about being asked to leave their homes on the coldest night of the year. Still, it was the safest thing to do.' Mr Simpson said he hadn't realised the object was a bomb, saying: 'I had just put it in my bag and it wasn’t until I began cleaning the things I had found that I realised what it was. Mr Simpson said he hadn't realised the object was a bomb and put it in a bucket of water outside his house, saying: 'I had just put it in my bag and it wasn’t until I began cleaning the things I had found that I realised what it was' ‘I put it in a bucket of water outside my house and called the police.' Mr Simpson said had he known the object was a bomb he would have simply 'marked the spot' and called the police. Police later sealed off his street while the deadly device was moved to a nearby recycling centre and placed under guard. It was taken to a farmer’s field the following morning by bomb disposal experts from Colchester Garrison and destroyed in a controlled explosion. Mr Simpson had been told the 20mm shell probably fell from an RAF fighter 70 years ago. He said: ‘There were a number of air battles over Essex during the Second World War. ‘This type of shell would have detonated when the red tip was pushed in. ‘On this device, the tip had been partly pushed but it had obviously not detonated. ‘It’s the first time I have ever found anything like this. Usually it’s coins and other items.’ An Army spokesman said the bomb 'still contained explosives'. The spokesman added: ‘Destroying the shell was the safest thing to do in the circumstances, as old ammunition can be quite unstable.’","Bartholomew Simpson found the bomb in woodland in Benfleet .

"Tahira Bano has been banned from owning a dog for 15 years after dumping her starving, dying puppy on a roadside in Rochdale . A mother who dumped her starved, dying puppy on the road in Rochdale was today banned from keeping dogs for 15 years. Tahira Bano's Staffordshire Bull Terrier was so emaciated and dehydrated she had to be put down just hours after rescuers found her. As a result of hypothermia the dog's heart beat could hardly be measured. RSPCA investigators were alerted after Bano phoned police claiming she had found the female dog wrapped in a blanket. An officer attended and found the puppy weighed just 18.7lb, almost half the 33lb normal weight for a breed of her size. The dog was believed to be between six and eight weeks old, the Manchester Evening News reported. After an appeal to the public for information, Bano was identified as the dog's owner. The 37-year-old lives on Cronkeyshaw Road in Rochdale, close to where the dog was found shortly before midnight on October 16, 2013. Bano insisted that the puppy was not hers and denied causing unnecessary suffering to it. But the mother-of-one was today found guilty at the Bury magistrates court and was sentenced to 18 weeks jail, suspended for two years. Bano was also ordered to do 100 hours of unpaid work and pay £2,000 in costs. The RSPCA had previously visited Bano on three occasions in 2011 and 2012 after complaints from the public about the welfare of a dog at her address, Kyra Badman, prosecuting said. Chairman of the bench Malcolm Bywater said Bano had neglected the puppy over a 'prolonged period', despite receiving advice form the RSPCA. Steven North, defending, said Bano, who works in a salon in Rochdale, continued to maintain her innocence and was considering an appeal. The Staffordshire Bull Terrier was so emaciated and dehydrated she had to be put down just hours after it was discovered on the roadside; as a result of hypothermia the dog's heart beat could hardly be measured. A police officer who collected the puppy from the roadside found the puppy weighed just 18.7lb, almost half the 33lb normal weight for a breed of her size . Bano continues to maintain the puppy was not hers, and claims she simply found the dog on the road . He said: 'It's difficult to mitigate in circumstances like this where someone still doesn't accept responsibility for their actions. 'However, she has no previous convictions and has never been before the courts before.' Speaking after the case, RSPCA Inspector Jason Bowles said: 'The aggravating feature here is that she denied that this was her dog, which to me is despicable. 'We rely on information given to us by the public.'","Tahira Bano dumped the dog on the roadside in Rochdale under a blanket .
