Dani Alves says his new Barcelona team-mate Luis Suarez 'should not change' because the former Liverpool striker's aggressive style of play is part of his 'trademark' and 'personality'. Suarez made the switch from Anfield to the Nou Camp for £75million during the summer, but must be patient to make his La Liga debut after being slapped with a four-month ban on all football-related activities for biting Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup. But Alves has urged the 27-year-old not to change, insisting it is what 'makes him different from everyone else'.

"By . Charlie Eccleshare . James Phillips, 22, will become the youngest ever manager in the FA Cup's 143-year history on Saturday when he takes charge of Romsey Town against Fareham Town. The youngster got hooked on the computer game Football Manager as a teenager, and now finds himself in charge of the Wessex League Division One side. Phillips began his coaching career at just 16 and after getting his FA Level One and Level Two badges was made manager of the Hampshire club, who have just been relegated and are in a period of rebuilding. Prodigy: At 22 years old, James Phillips is the youngest ever manager in the history of the  FA Cup . Focused: Phillips commands the respect of the Romsey Town dressing room despite his tender years . Ahead of the Extra Preliminary Round clash, Phillips said: 'We've done a massive rebuilding job and recruited around 30 new players who all can't wait to get out and play in the FA Cup. 'The club made the first round last year - we have four or five games to reach that this year but I would like to think we can match that.' Phillips will next month start his Uefa B Licence, but for now his focus is on Romsey Town, whose squad includes players more than 10 years older than him - club captain and centre back Ben Andrews is 33. Are you paying attention? Phillips puts his players through their paces in a training session . The custom vehicle fitter and former goalkeeper said: 'I had the ability [as a player] but I didn't think I could progress in the game so I took up coaching. 'I've always been interested in management and the tactics of the game - ever since I got my first Football Manager computer game. 'As soon as I got home from school I would play it for ages - I even got my local side Eastleigh FC to the Premier League.'

"By . Craig Hope . Follow @CraigHope_DM . From manager selfies to naked Dutchman to goal-line technology freezing on a winter's night at Stoke, the Premier League promises to be as enthralling as ever this season. Here, Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we're likely to see over the coming 10 months... Arsenal set the pace, then end up off it.. Aaron Ramsey is fit and firing, Jack Wilshere is smoking hot, the World Cup winners return on a high and Alexis Sanchez is the early-season star. Yes, the Gunners will fire themselves to the top of the table and breeze through autumn. Even in early January Sportsmail will run '10 reasons why Arsenal can win the Premier League'. And then they will fall away, Arsene Wenger citing injuries and lack of depth as the cause. Does he still have Kim Kallstrom's number, we wonder? Top talent: Arsenal's £30million signing Alexis Sanchez (right) has fans dreaming of the Premier League title . Tony Pulis is the first manager to leave and second to be appointed... Presuming his seat at Crystal Palace is filled in the next week, we wouldn't bet against Pulis landing the first job which becomes available in the Premier League – and that will probably be in a fortnight's time. The canny, capped coach is too good to be part of the out-of-work crowd who share the Sky Sports exposure between them. Alan Curbishley is in charge of that rota, by the way. Great pedigree: Tony Pulis has never been relegated during his managerial career . Daniel Sturridge dances, a lot... Luis Suarez may have gone but that just leaves more goals for Sturridge. He was one of the very few who emerged with a scrap of credit from the World Cup and – minus the distraction of the brilliant yet often selfish Suarez – Sturridge can better his 24 goals from last season. And that means one thing, let's dance... Mover and shaker: Daniel Sturridge's dance celebration was seen on a regular occurrence last season . Ross Barkley gives us hope... The boy will be a superstar. Barkley, still only 20, is the future of English football and this is the season when us Three Lions followers – regardless of club allegiance – are finally given hope that a better day lies ahead. He's got craft, he's got graft, he's got pace, he's got power. Steven Gerrard is gone, but a new Scouse schemer is ready to man England's midfield for the next decade. Boy wonder: Ross Barkley will be looking to kick-on from an excellent season last term . Goal-line technology will fail... Yes, this is the season when we debate our first glitch in the thus far flawless system. It will come on a rain-swept, wind-lashed winter's evening at Stoke with temperatures below zero, visibility low and senses numbed. Lionel Messi wouldn't fancy that and we're betting the technology doesn't either. We only hope Jonathan Pearce is commentating on the game... Ground-breaking: Premier League will use goal-line technology for the first-time ever this season . Busy: Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech  Szczesny is notorious for posting 'selfies' on social media . Biting . Fernando Torres celebrating . Joey Barton quitting Twitter . Jose Mourinho on the touchline for all 38 games . A competitive England game . Ryan Giggs on a football pitch (yes, it's true) Harry Redknapp drive straight into a training ground . Roy Hodgson telling jokes . Selfies, selfies, selfies... Have you heard of selfies? No? Well you need to take a good look at yourself, preferably with a camera phone. Dressing-room selfies, on-the-pitch selfies, out-and-about selfies – and that's just Arsenal's Wojciech 'selfie' Szczesny. This, however, is the season we see our first manager selfie. Yes, rather than the traditional pre-match handshake, we're betting Jose Mourinho whips out his mobile and gets a snap of himself and Arsene Wenger which will be posted to Twitter before the game has even kicked off... Big Sam survives (again)... He'll do enough, he always does. Despite supporter unrest and boardroom murmurings, Sam Allardyce will preserve his employment by winning just enough matches in which his side have 'nullified the opposition's strengths and exposed their weaknesses' (type that into Google, see how many Allardyce quotes you get)... Standing tall: Sam Allardyce will keep West Ham up next season, despite his style of football . VIDEO We have to hit the ground running - Allardyce . Manchester City set new record for foreign XIs... We saw it last week in the Community Shield, City failing to field an English player from the off. And with Joe Hart seemingly out of favour and James Milner never in favour, good old Frank Lampard could be fighting our corner at the Etihad. He's off to New York in January, however, and the likelihood is that the majority of City's starting elevens this season will consist entirely of overseas players. And this is from the English champions.... Foreign pact: Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini failed to start an Englishman against Arsenal on Sunday . Peace in the North-East... Finally, on a more sombre note, the death of Newcastle fans Liam Sweeney and John Alder in the MH17 disaster has united the North-East. A fund set up by a Sunderland fan raised more than £30,000 in their memory and former Black Cats goalkeeper Jimmy Montgomery will represent the club when tributes are paid at St James' Park this weekend. The first Tyne-Wear derby of the season does not come until December, but it should mark the first occasion when the rival supporters applaud each other as a show of respect before the game. Then, of course, the action on the pitch starts... Touching: Sunderland have raised funds in memory of two Newcastle fans who died during the MH17 disaster . Louis van Gaal drops his pants in the Old Trafford dressing-room... By way of a motivational tactic, it's probably the best we've ever come across. Disillusioned with his Bayern Munich stars, Van Gaal dropped his pants to prove he had the 'balls' to axe any of them. And as good as United have looked in pre-season, it will only take a couple of defeats for last season's self-doubt to resurface. That could well see Van Gaal lose his rag, and his trousers. High hopes: New Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal will be aiming to turn around the club's fortunes .","Sportsmail predicts 10 things you'll likely see this Premier League season .

"By . Jonny Singer . Mo Farah suffered a slight scare before holding on to win the European 10,000m title from fellow Briton Andy Vernon. Farah, whose fitness had been questioned before the race, seemed in control throughout the 25 laps, but was made to work hard in the final 400m before pulling away. Vernon, who was sixth at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, produced an excellent display to take silver, passing Turkish athlete Ali Kaya on the line. VIDEO Scroll down for Mo Farah sets his first world record... in the 100m sack race . Triumph: Farah crosses the line to take gold with Vernon just behind him in a British one-two . Emotional: Farah kisses the track as he adds yet another gold medal to his collection . In a fairly sedate race Farah never looked uncomfortable, but he never stretched the race, choosing to let other athletes set the pace. The Briton hit the front for the first time with seven laps to go, but didn't start to pull away from the field until the final-lap bell. Double delight: Vernon and Farah pose together with a Union Jack after taking the top two medals . Easy does it: Farah had allowed others to set the pace as he ran a gentle race until the final few laps . As Farah tried to accelerate on the final bend he was matched stride for stride by Kaya, but on the home straight Farah finally made sure of the victory, as Kaya fell away to allow Vernon in for silver. The Olympic Champion, who missed the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, was visibly delighted as he crossed the line, and apologised to any fans he'd let down by being unable to compete in Scotland. 'This meant a lot to me,' said Farah. 'Two weeks ago it was a doubt if i was going to compete it. IT wasn't easy. I wanted to run the Commonwealth Games but I couldn't so coming here to run the Europeans meant a lot to me.' Two champions: Usain Bolt was on hand to congratulate Farah after his victory . 'I didn't want to let people down, for all the people who bought tickets I let them down. I couldn't be there because I was nowhere near my best shape.' 100m World Record holder Usain Bolt was in Zurich and congratulated Farah on his lap of honour. It was a season's best time for Vernon, and while Farah merely met expectations, the silver medalist will be delighted with his performance. It completes a show of dominance for Great Britain in the event, with Jo Pavey taking gold in the Women's 10,000m on Tuesday night.","British one-two in 10,000m final .

"By . Martha Kelner for Mail On Sunday . Follow @@marthakelner . Mo Farah and James Dasaolu both won European gold to continue Great Britain’s best ever start to a major athletics championships, a seven-medal haul with more likely in the coming days. ‘We’re all feeding off each other,’ said Dasaolu. ‘Everyone’s feeling positive.’ Farah won the 10,000 metres title just ahead of team-mate Andy Vernon to rescue a lacklustre season and emulate the success of Jo Pavey in the women’s race on Tuesday. Dasaolu then won the 100m with a relieved Harry Aikines-Aryeetey taking bronze. VIDEO Scroll down for Mo Farah sets his first world record... in the 100m sack race . Winning ways: James Dasaolu cruised to victory in the men's 100m with a time of 10.06sec . Double delight: Mo Farah (middle) won the 10,000 metres title just ahead of team-mate Andy Vernon (left) Medals table: Great Britain top the charts at the end of competition on day two in Zurich . To cap an historic day in Zurich, Tiffany Porter won the 100m hurdles gold and Ashleigh Nelson 100m bronze. Dasaolu cruised to victory in 10.06sec, a long way behind his personal best of 9.91 but enough to seal victory over France’s Christophe Lemaitre, who took silver. The Briton still acknowledged he will need to improve to challenge the Caribbean and American sprinters who dominate the world stage. ‘Winning a medal is going to give me confidence but I’m under no illusion that the guys out there are running 9.8 and 9.9 on a regular basis,’ he said. ‘There is still work to be done. But if we rewind to February when I pulled my hamstring and my tendon, that was a down-point. I wasn’t sure that I was going to be able to compete in the summer so this is a lovely feeling.’ Dasaolu’s title represents Great Britain’s first individual sprint medal since Darren Campbell won gold at the European Championships in Budapest in 1998. The 26-year-old had proved his durability by qualifying fastest in the semi-finals. France’s Jimmy Vicaut, the fastest man in Europe this season, did not make it to the start line, withdrawing with a knee injury. There had been hopeful suggestions that Dasaolu might threaten Linford Christie’s British 100m record of 9.87, which has stood for 21-years. The track at Zurich’s Letzigrund stadium is famously quick, but the weather was not conducive to fast running. A vicious wind caused the meeting to be delayed by 30 minutes and a light rain began to fall just before the start. There was a further wait after Aikines-Aryeetey was shown a yellow card for a false start. Flying the flag: Tiffany Porter of Great Britain poses with a Union Jack after winning gold in Zurich . Champion: Jo Pavey celebrates after winning her first career title at the age of 40 . ‘My spike dropped out of my shoe, which caused it,’ said the south Londoner. ‘When I saw I wasn’t (disqualified) I just said “thank you Lord”.’ Seconds later he was being confirmed as the bronze medallist in a photo-finish with Dwain Chambers. Aikines-Aryeetey sank to his knees with a beaming smile. The start had also not been one of Dasaolu’s best. ‘I just had to zone out and focus,’ the new champion said. ‘I actually thought I had messed up my opportunity of even picking up a medal but once I got through my drive phase I was able to pull away and win.’ As for double Olympic champion Farah, he is a long way from his best but gritted his teeth as he crossed the line to become European 10,000m champion six weeks after dramatically collapsing at a training camp. Farah was forced to work hard in the final lap, grimacing as he powered down the home straight ahead of Great Britain team-mate Vernon and two Turkish athletes. The Farah showboating was saved until after victory was confirmed in 28min 8.11sec. Then the Mobots flowed and he was embraced by friend Usain Bolt, who was in Zurich doing promotional work. It was no surprise Farah was below par — this is only his second race on the track in a year where he collapsed twice, came a disappointing eighth in the London Marathon and withdrew from the Commonwealth Games because he was unfit. Thumbs up: Youngster Harry Aikines-Aryeetey kept up the medal haul with bronze in the men's 100m . Two champions: Usain Bolt was on hand to congratulate Farah after his victory . Vernon was perhaps best known previously for his Twitter spat with Scottish athlete Lynsey Sharp last week. He sniped at the 800m runner for boasting about buying a designer handbag after winning silver at the Commonwealth Games. Farah had sauntered off the start-line and remained at the back of the pack for two laps. One effortless kick and he had moved up to be second of 24 athletes after four circuits. He was, as Steve Cram remarked, ‘putting his comfortable coat on’. After the year he’s had, Farah needed a cushioned reintroduction to major competition on the track. He spoke earlier this week of his latest collapse 40 days ago when he lost consciousness in his bathroom after a training run in Park City, Utah. ‘It’s been a hard time for me,’ he said. ‘I’ve still got four stitches in my ear from falling in the bathroom so to come out here and win meant more than anything else in the world.’ ‘This one meant a lot to me,’ he said. ‘Two weeks ago there was doubt I was going to compete here after I pulled out of the Commonwealth Games. I wanted this title more badly because of that.’ He was followed home by Vernon, who chased down Turkey’s Ali Kaya and dipped on the line to clinch the silver in 28:08.66.

"By . Ian Ladyman for The Mail on Sunday . It was one of the most iconic images of last season’s thrilling title race, Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard huddled with his players on the Anfield turf imploring them not to falter in the wake of their 3-2 victory over Manchester City that appeared to have nudged momentum their way. In the mind of Manuel Pellegrini, though, it was the work simultaneously being done in the losers’ dressing room that day that ultimately made the difference. From the desolation and pain of what City manager Pellegrini has always maintained was an unjust defeat grew the resolution to produce a five-match winning sequence that snatched City’s second title in three years. Despair: Manchester City succumbed to a 3-2 defeat at Anfield last season but eventually won the title . Elation: Philippe Coutinho netted the winner for Liverpool against Manchester City at Anfield in April . Reflection: Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini insists defeat at Anfield inspired their title victory . ‘The turning point was when we lost that game against them at Anfield,’ said Pellegrini ahead of Monday’s meeting between the teams at the Etihad Stadium. ‘We were convinced we had to win the last five games to win the title and we knew we could do it. ‘We were absolutely convinced we could do it because we felt when we lost against Liverpool that we played better than Liverpool in that game. ‘It was a special day for Liverpool and there were a lot of mistakes by the referee also, but we never complained about that. ‘We never opened our mouths or said anything about the referees. We were sure that if we were able to win the last five games we would do it. ‘Of course it acted as motivation because when you finish that game, if you feel the other team is better than you, maybe they deserved to be the champions. Celebration: Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was overjoyed as his side beat City in April . Frustration: Manuel Pellegrini was not happy with the refereeing decisions during the game at Anfield . ‘But all of us finished that game thinking we were unlucky to lose.’ Liverpool’s Gerrard, of course, was to have his own moment of ignimony further down the stretch. A slip against Chelsea in his team’s next home game effectively handed the initiative back to Pellegrini and his City side. ‘They were very unlucky in that game against Chelsea but they were very lucky in the game they played against us because Vincent Kompany had a very similar slip before their winning goal,’ said the Chilean. ‘It wasn’t exactly the same (as Gerrard’s slip), but very similar. Of course I feel sorry for him. I always feel sorry for players who make a mistake but I don’t think that slip decided the title. There were 38 games through the whole year and, anyway, it was not really a mistake.’ ‘It was a problem with the pitch. It is not that he missed a pass inside the box or something. It was slippy, it can happen to any player.’ Despite Liverpool’s efforts last season, Brendan Rodgers and his team arrive in Manchester on Monday facing some questions. With Luis Suarez now a Barcelona player, many feel that Liverpool’s title challenge has already been neutered. Focused: Manchester City's Aleksandr Kolarov (left to right), Stevan Jovetic and James Milner in training . Determined: City host Liverpool at the Etihad Stadium on Monday night in a huge Premier League clash . Talking tactics: Pellegrini (second left) watches his players during training ahead of the Liverpool match . One feels Pellegrini suspects the same, even if he is too cute to say so directly. ‘It is very difficult to replace a player that did what Luis Suarez did last season,’ he added. ‘It was a very important season for Luis Suarez. Maybe in his first year at Liverpool it was not so important for him. ‘But to replace what he did last year is very difficult. But I suppose with all the players they bought they will do it.’ Liverpool manager Rodgers has occasionally spoken a little dismissively of City’s own approach to the transfer market, suggesting that the Merseyside club do things ‘differently’. Again, though, Pellegrini has no time for the criticism. ‘It was very important the way we finished the season last year, not only to win the games in the Premier League but also to demonstrate the character of this team,’ stressed Pellegrini. ‘A lot of media always talk about money, but this is not money. You can’t do that just with money - you can do it with character, personality, with style of play, a lot of things. ‘Maybe we have to discuss longer about that some day but always when we win it is not about money. ‘I am absolutely sure that if you do not spend money on a good squad it is impossible to win the title.Other teams spend money also. This year there are a lot of teams who have spent more than us. ‘So it is not about money. It is money in the sense you need a strong squad but there are lot of things after the money you must do if you want to be champions.’ Iconic: Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard's celebration after the match in April is engrained in the memory .","Manchester City lost 3-2 at Anfield in April but went on to win title .

The Premier League giants may have returned home after competing in the Guinness International Champions Cup, but there is still one European powerhouse in the United States. German champions Bayern Munich will be the latest European team to feature in the annual MLS All Star Game when they take on a team comprising the best players in the North American league in Portland on Wednesday night. The 22,000 capacity Providence Park, home to the Portland Timbers, will host the latest contest between the MLS All Stars and an elite European side, which has become an annual showpiece for the league.

Last year, Roma were the visitors and the Italian side won 3-1. in Kansas City. In 2012, Chelsea were beaten 3-2 in Chester Pennsylvania while the two years before that resulted in dominant wins for Manchester United - 5-2 in Houston in 2010 and 4-0 in Harrison in 2011. As is the case with All Star games across North America's four major professional leagues - NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL - the result of this match is not important. For Bayern Munich, it is another 90 minutes during their pre-season campaign as they prepare for their Bundesliga defence. For the MLS, this is an event and a spectacle, one which will showcase the best players the league has to offer to the world.

The World Cup saw record television crowds in the US as the country embraced Jurgen Klinsmann's team. Since then, the arrivals of the likes of Frank Lampard and David Villa, both of whom have signed for New York City, have also been announced. The German champions are by far the stronger side on paper with their squad featuring six World Cup winners and the likes of Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery and Robert Lewandowski.

Arsene Wenger wants to sign a new defender before the transfer deadline following the departure of Thomas Vermaelen to Barcelona.

The North London club believe Olympiakos will sell their highly-rated defender, who played for Greece during the World Cup. But doubts linger over whether Manolas is prepared to sign for the Gunners without the guarantee of regular first team football.

"By . Chris Wheeler . Follow @@ChrisWheelerDM . Frank Lampard will be given every chance to extend his England career by New York City after moving to America’s Major League Soccer. The 36-year-old former Chelsea midfielder has won 103 caps for his country and has yet to decide whether to follow Steven Gerrard and Ashley Cole into international retirement. But New York’s director of football Claudio Reyna insists that the Manchester City owned club will support Lampard if he wants to make himself available for the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Frank Lampard give his first press conference at New York City FC .

Welcome to the USA: Frank Lampard was officially unveiled as a New York City FC player on Thursday . Touch down: Frank Lampard was pictured at JFK Airport on Wednesday evening ahead of today's unveiling . ‘We would support any player,’ said Reyna. ‘It would be great for him and great for us as well. We signed David Villa and he was representing us at a World Cup, so we would never ever tell a player not to play for their national team.’ With New York’s players not reporting for pre-season until January and Lampard reluctant to follow Villa to Australia to keep fit with City’s other sister team Melbourne, it would be difficult for England boss Roy Hodgson to select the veteran midfielder if he is effectively without a club for six months. However, Reyna has not ruled out the possibility of Lampard training with the Premier League champions in the meantime. He added: ‘It’s something we’ll sit down face to face and speak to people – the Manchester City team, the manager, and have those conversations. ‘Nothing’s decided yet. We need to keep Frank sharp and fit, and that’s what he wants. The most important thing for us is that he’s ready to go in January.’ Straight into action: Lampard trains with youth teams in Brooklyn after being unveiled .

We spoke to them and said they have to show up, train, and really carry on being what they’ve been – model professionals and great players. ‘It’s a very competitive league. There are a lot of challenges – weather, travel, the level of the games. There are going to be many players and teams motivated to play us because of the players we have. ‘Certainly in our city, we need big names, star players. The fans here identify with it in all sports. David and Frank tick all the boxes and hopefully our third designated player will be in the same category. ‘MLS has done a great job in making sure the league grows at the right pace. We need to continue to be mindful of our growth but it is a moment where we’re ready to take the next step. We hope that with some of the other newer franchises, like David Beckham in Miami, that we continue with this development. Come here, you: Lampard gives New York City FC sporting director Claudio Reyna the runaround when the former played for Manchester City . ‘The league has signed Kaka, we have Robbie Keane and other big-name players so it’s important. We’d like to get players a little bit earlier but at the same time we’re competing with Europe where they are still paid well and playing at the highest level.’ Reyna is delighted that Lampard decided to move to New York after his 13-year stay at Chelsea came to an end. ‘Having spoken to him and his excitement for this new challenge it was really a no-brainer to make him a New York City FC player,’ said Reyna. ‘There are many out there who were interested to come but it was really important that we got the right one. End of an era: Lamaprd ended his 13-year association with Chelsea at the end of last season . Moving on: Ashley Cole (left) and Lampard left Chelsea at the end of last season - John Terry (right) remains . ‘Just seeing that he’s still where he’s at and takes care of himself, it makes sense to have someone like him on the field. ‘Everyone knows what he does – he scores goals, he sets up goals, that’s the type of player he’s always been and we intend to use him in the same way. ‘We’re not asking him to do anything different, but for our club it’s a tremendous boost and the next chapter in our short history.’ All white on the night: Lampard refused to give any indication on his England future at Thursday's press conference .","Former Chelsea midfielder is yet to decide on his international future .

"By . Sami Mokbel for MailOnline . Following the departure of Thomas Vermaelen to Barcelona, Arsene Wenger is on the hunt for a new centre-back to bolster his defensive options. Calum Chambers may have arrived from Southampton, with the 19-year-old putting in a couple of fine displays so far against Manchester City in the Community Shield and Crystal Palace in the Premier League, but Wenger is determined to add extra cover in the position. Targeted, then, is Olympiacos defender Kostas Manolos. Here, Sportsmail runs the rule over the Greek international to assess whether he is the right fit for Arsenal. Runner: Kostas Manolas (right) chases the ball against AC Milan's Giamopaolo Pazzini . Tussle: The Greek champions faced the Italian giants during the International Champions Cup in pre-season . Age: 23 . Born: Naxos, Greece . Career: 2009: Thrsyvoulos . 2009-12: AEK Athens . 2012-present: Olympiacos . International career: 13 caps . Kostas who? Manolas. He’s 23, a centre-back. He’s a good height for a centre-half, too, 6ft 2ins. He currently plays for Olympiakos. His uncle is Stelios Manolas, who played 71 times for Greece. Why do Arsenal want him? First and foremost they are in need of a centre-back following Thomas Vermaelen’s departure to Barcelona. Secondly, he’s actually quite good. He’s got Champions League experience with Olympiakos which is obviously a big attraction for Arsene Wenger. His performances for Greece during the World Cup were promising, too, particularly against Didier Drogba and Joel Campbell. For a tall guy, he’s no slouch either, which will be important in the rapid world of the Barclays Premier League. Tussle: Manolas fights for the ball with Robin van Persie during the Champions League last season . Seems like a no brainer then? Not quite. He’s spent his entire career playing in Greece; not the most competitive league in European football. So while he has produced top performances in the Champions League and World Cup, he hasn’t produced consistent performances in one of the continent’s top leagues. So what’s his background? He began his career at Thrasyvoulos, making his first team debut as an 17-year-old in 2009. But he didn’t stick around at Thrasyvoulos for long. He was quickly scouted by his uncle Stelios, who was technical director at AEK Athens at the time. And in June 2009, he signed a three-year contract with the Greek giants. ‘I am very happy signing for the team I support, hopefully I can be a legend at the club like my uncle and end my career at AEK.’ In his first seven matches for AEK, he was voted man of the match for five of them. He helped AEK to the Greek Cup in 2011, before moving to Olympiakos in 2012. World stage: Manolas impressed during the World Cup with Greece . If he is that good why hasn’t he move earlier? He’s certainly had interested parties. Then Everton manager David Moyes was interested in taking Manolas to Goodison Park in January 2012, saying: ‘Manolas has huge talent and is a player of the future.’ But Manolas was reported to have turned down a move to Merseyside. And the links to the Barclays Premier League have not gone away. Tottenham, Sunderland and Fulham were all after  the 23-year-old in January, while Liverpool have been credited with an interest this summer.

"By . Riath Al-Samarrai for the Daily Mail . Follow @@riathalsam . For a man who did so much good work in cricket, Richard Bevan should have known when to play with a straight bat. For a man who held an international rally driving licence for six years, he should have known when to swerve. But Bevan has crashed this time. The ball has gone through the grille. From the 11 years he spent at the Professional Cricketers’ Association to his six at the helm of the League Managers Association, not many in either sport speak of his mistakes because there aren’t many. He is respected, he trumpets the causes most would agree with and, generally, has succeeded in modernising two organisations that needed it. Resignation: Cardiff said that Richard Bevan's position is now untenable and the LMA boss should resign . Texts: The LMA described Malky Mackay's messages to Iain Moody as ‘friendly text message banter’ His default position has been to support his members, which in the majority of cases in a trigger-happy sport has been the right course of action. But his organisation has taken a big risk in the case of Malky Mackay. Far from helping Mackay’s situation, the statement from Bevan’s organisation made it worse, if possible. The extent of Bevan’s involvement in the statement is not known. But the end product is way out of kilter with his background. He is a well-educated man, an astute politician of sport. He went to the prestigious Shrewsbury School, whose alumni include Lord Hutton and Michael Heseltine. His profiles variously point to him competing in three RAC Rallies, as well as windsurfing, playing football and cricket to a high amateur standard and golfing to a handicap of six. But in sports administration he has made his name. People in cricket talk of a tough, streetwise negotiator who shaped up the PCA. He was the statesmanlike figure guiding the England team in their decision to boycott a tour of Zimbabwe in 2003. His work to help former cricketers who fell on hard times should also be noted. He has made errors since taking over the LMA in 2008, but he has also spoken a lot of sense, questioning the consequences of transfer windows and calling for the FA to hold more power over the Premier League. Well-eductaed: Bevan, pictured with David Moyes, has made mistakes at the LMA but has also spoken sense . His work has been motivated by a desire to protect managers, who obviously need it at a time when only 16 of the 92 clubs have retained their boss since the 2011 calendar year. ‘Telling people, “It’s fine, get a mortgage” and the following week sacking them is something that they cannot do,’ Bevan said earlier this year. Sadly, what his organisation said about Mackay’s situation made far less sense.","League Managers Association released a second statement relating to the Malky Mackay and Iain Moody 'Textgate' scandal on Friday .

"By . Adam Crafton for the Daily Mail . Mathieu Flamini believes Arsenal are finally getting to grips with the perils of life on the road in the Barclays Premier League after the Gunners rallied to hold Everton to a 2-2 draw at Goodison. The Londoners were humbled 3-0 on this ground late last season and looked to be heading for further embarrassment on Merseyside after Seamus Coleman and Steven Naismith gave Everton a two-goal lead going into the break. But, after Aaron Ramsey cut the deficit after 83 minutes, substitute Olivier Giroud headed a late equaliser from Nacho Monreal's cross. Scroll down for videos... On the road: Mathieu Flamini claims that Arsenal have learned how to play difficult away games . One downbeat note for the Gunners was the half-time substitution of Chilean Alexis Sanchez, their £35million summer signing, who manager Arsene Wenger felt 'struggled with the physicality' and which saw the lively Giroud brought on. But French midfielder Flamini said: 'We've learned a lot from last year about playing these kind of teams away and we came back today and tried to be stronger. 'We didn't give up until the last second so it was a game to remember for us. It was a great performance from the team because being 2-0 down was not easy for us. Even though we were losing in the first half we had a few occasions to score so it was a bit unfair for us.' Hope: Aaron Ramsey collects the ball after scoring late to bring the score to 2-1 at Goodison . Game changer: Olivier Giroud came off the bench to score the equaliser before a late ankle injury . Meanwhile, Arsene Wenger praised Giroud for changing the game after coming on as a second-half substitute. 'We looked much more dangerous (after Giroud came on),' the Arsenal manager said. 'I knew we were dominating the game in the second half and we needed some physical presence up front. That presence was very important. 'He had a very good second half.' Unfortunately for Wenger, Giroud suffered an ankle injury in the dying minutes and could now miss the second leg of Arsenal's Champions League play-off against Besiktas. 'It is a big game and I hope we have not lost him,' said Wenger of Giroud, who left Goodison Park with a protective boot on his left foot. 'In the final minute he stretched his ankle. At the moment it doesn't look too good. ' Not fit enough! Alexis Sanchez was withdrawn at half-time after an ineffectual performance . Sanchez is likely to lead the line against the Turks, who gained a 0-0 draw against the Gunners in Istanbul on Wednesday. Wenger said he had no option but to withdraw the £35million signing at half-time on Saturday. 'At the moment he is not completely ready physically,' Wenger said.

"By . Pa Reporter . Kent have announced 2005 Ashes winner Geraint Jones will leave the club at the end of the season once his deal expires. The wicketkeeper-batsman, who played a full part in England's historic victory over Australia nine years ago, has been kept out of the side this season by Sam Billings. He spent part of this campaign on loan with Gloucestershire as a replacement for the injured Gareth Roderick, but has spent most of the year in Kent's second XI team. Leaving: Geraint Jones (left at the Kent photocall), has spent most of the season at Gloucestershire (right) Triumph: Jones was part of the 2005 Ashes-winning squad with Ian Bell (left) and Kevin Pietersen . And the county have now decided that the 38-year-old is surplus to requirements and will not be offered a new contract. Kent president and chairman of cricket Graham Johnson said 'Decisions such as these are never easy and Geraint has been dignified in his approach to his contract position and extremely supportive of the squad during the 2014 season. 'Geraint can be rightly proud of the huge contribution to Kent cricket that he has made over his career. He has followed in a great line of Kent wicketkeeper-batsmen and will take his place in that dynasty.' Jones played 34 Tests and and 49 one-day internationals for England although he was one of the casualties of the 2006-07 Ashes whitewash defeat, when he was dropped after the third Test in Perth. He made his first-class debut in 2001 and was part of the side that lifted the Pro40 title that season as well as the domestic Twenty20 crown six years later. 'I would like to thank the members and supporters for the backing they have given me over my time at Kent,' he said. 'I will look back with a tremendous amount of pride on all that I have achieved with the county.'","Jones was wicketkeeper when England won 2005 Ashes .

"By . Suzy Miller . Moved on: Suzy Miller is happy as a divorcee . The day of the wedding was perfect: the sun shone, the bride looked radiant and the food and drink flowed. Posing with my three children and their father for the photos, I couldn't have felt more delighted. Except, unlike me, Chris wasn't there as a guest. He was the groom. Given that we'd split four years earlier after he left - nearly destroying me in the process - it seems incredible I was invited to his nuptials, and that I'd even wanted to attend. It was important for me to be there because I strongly believe the best way forward for scorned exes - particularly when there are children involved - is not revenge, but to accept every part of an ex's new life without complaint. That includes his new partner. When our ten-year relationship ended, I could never have imagined attending Chris's wedding, nor giving him his own set of keys to my new family home so he could pop in. Not when he had betrayed my trust in such a devastating way. Until that point, Chris was my whole life. We'd met in our late 20s, and within a few months, had moved in together and were planning a family. After four years, we had our first child, our daughter Cydney. Joseph and Henry followed. We rarely argued. He worked hard as a factory manager to provide for us, and my career as a script editor in the film industry dwindled when our third child came along, so I became increasingly dependent upon him financially and emotionally. I remember thinking: 'If he ever left me it would be like someone cutting off my right arm'. Little did I know how much of a premonition that was. One night in 2003, Chris announced he wanted to leave me and our children, then aged six, four and 18 months - and my world came crashing down. He'd sobbed on my shoulder as he told me he'd been having a fling with a local woman, a relationship which had now ended. And now we'd probably have to sell our home. I realised there was no future for us as a couple and, for the first time, contemplated a terrifying future as a single mother with no home and a career long past. Worst of all, I was about to turn 40. Not much of 'a catch' for any new man either. Surely, if anyone should be in floods of tears it should be me? But at the time I was too angry and broken to cry. I was furious. I was hurt and ashamed. My self-esteem was gone. The aftermath of that catastrophic night was horrendous. At first, I waded through the days in a state of complete shock. First family: Suzy and Chris and their three children when they were still together . Then the anger and emotional pain started to take hold. I moved into a rented house and would cry and shout at him down the phone, and avoid conversations when we swapped the kids over at weekends. But very quickly I realised I had to make a choice about how to deal with what had happened, or it was going to eat up my life and harm the children into the bargain. I could choose to let my bitterness and rage rule my thinking - and become one of those angry women who are always slagging off their ex and never seem to find any real joy in life any more. Or, I could put on a brave face and do what was right for the children while my soul slowly died inside. But I knew that by keeping anger and hurt hidden, it would eventually find its way out in the form of illness or depression. Or might there be a third way? But what was this third way? How could I possibly build a healthy relationship to co-parent children with someone who had metaphorically ripped out my heart, then carved it up with a chainsaw for good measure? Although I was livid with what he'd done, I knew that punishing him was not going to help anyone. Particularly our children. After all, they were half of both of us. If I said bad things about their dad that meant I was also attacking half the child. One day, fighting back the desire to vent my anger, I sat Chris down and said: 'Our children don't care who's done what; they don't judge us. All they care about is how we deal with this from now on. They are learning from us how to manage relationships - we need to show them a better way.' He went quiet and I knew that through his grief, confusion and guilt he understood what I was saying. But it all hinged on me finding a way to forgive and move on. So I put myself on what I can only describe as a crash course on how to see myself not as a victim, but as a woman blessed with a chance to start again. Second wife: Chris is now married to Marilyn and Suzy is happy for them . I may not have chosen for my family to be broken up in such a painful way, but I realised that the choice of how I dealt with the situation was mine. It was tough at times. I had to accept some responsibility for what had happened. Instead of hating my beloved man for throwing away our relationship for a meaningless fling, I tried to see things from his point of view. Clearly, the stress of supporting us all was huge. He was deeply unhappy and just because we had made three beautiful babies together didn't mean he had to spend the rest of his life with me. Painfully, I began to see that outside of the children, Chris and I had very little in common. I devoured every self-help book friends could lend me, ignored negative comments and 'advice' about my ex (many friends deemed my attitude 'weird') and determined to transform myself from bitter single mother to someone free to have fun again. Within a few years, I had been on some wonderful dates and realised I could actually enjoy sex more in my 40s than when I was in my 20s. Because I wasn't bitter about the past and refused to believe all men were untrustworthy, I was complimented on being easy to date. I launched a website, the Alternative Divorce Guide, to show couples there is a better way to manage break-ups. I also set up a directory where they could find mediators, collaborative lawyers and counsellors. Amicable split: Suzy, Chris and their children pose for a family photo on his wedding day to Marilyn . I danced joyfully at parties and made new friends. Of course, it bothered me when Chris announced he was seeing Marilyn, a beautiful young woman 20 years my junior. And there was a flash of jealousy but, after getting over the initial strangeness of it all, she and I got along brilliantly. I genuinely adored my children's new stepmother. I was heartened when she confided her relief that an angry divorce like that of her parents was not something my - now our - children would have to suffer. When they married, four years after Chris and I split, my friends considered it beyond bizarre that I wanted to go to the wedding. I was delighted to be invited. Wasn't this what I'd set out to achieve? This was surely how the perfect female ex behaved. As the photos were taken, on Brighton beach, the photographer turned to Chris, the children and me and asked us to gather for a photograph. I could sense people around us were clearly uncomfortable with the line-up and there were a few double-takes. And even I took some persuading. But the photographer insisted. He could see that the kids and I were still very important to Chris, and that it was only right to have a family photo of us at the wedding. Unlikely alliance: Suzy with her ex husband's new wife, Marilyn, who she gets on with famously . And I'm so grateful he did, as I look back at that photo with real pride now. I don't think I'd feel the same if instead I'd chosen to play the blame game. Chris and I have three perfectly well-balanced children who do not feel torn between warring parents. They live with me, but stay with him and his new wife frequently and Chris visits them at my house often. When I read about the terrible increase in the numbers of children self-harming due to the stress of divorce, I thank God that I had it in me to be magnanimous and forgive. To put the needs of my children first. So, if you are battling through a break-up and want to build a new and healthy relationship with your ex, don't listen to the people who raise their eyebrows when you tell them you are doing breakfast for the whole family on Christmas morning - including your ex and his new wife. Or, if they think it's strange that your ex is building you a new kitchen in his rare moments of spare time, because he knows that will make life much easier for you as a mum. What's so wrong with being nice to your ex? It's hard to be a perfect wife, even harder to be a perfect ex - but the rewards are beyond measure.

It may have been five years since the Pussycat Dolls went their separate ways, but with rumours of a reunion sparked by Nicole Scherzinger, it seems they're still as cool as when they burst onto the scene with Don't Cha back in 2003. While lead singer Nicole may have had the most solo success since leaving, Kimberly Wyatt has worked as a DJ and a judge on Sky1's Got to Dance since her pop star days. Clearly not content, she's now following in her former bandmate's footsteps by designing her own fashion range, too. Kimberly, 32, has designed and modelled a new range of jumpsuits for Dancing Leopard, which, she says, are designed to flatter all figures with 'beautiful bohemian, feminine silhouettes'. Singer turned designer: Kimberly Wyatt shot to fame as one sixth of Pussycat Dolls and her career is still going strong. Her latest project? Designing a range of jumpsuits and dresses for Dancing Leopard . The collection has apparently been designed with careful consideration of design, colours and fabrics - all of which have been chosen by Kimberly to reflect her taste and style. The designs can be dressed up or down, and, she says, are the epitome of transitional summer style. Speaking about the collaboration, she said: 'I am a big fan of Dancing Leopard and was delighted to design a seven piece range for them - I have hand-picked all the fabrics and colours and am really pleased with the designs. Mellow yellow: The collection has apparently been designed with careful consideration of design, colours and fabrics and the dresses cost £39 . Boho babe: Kimberly has chosen the designs to reflect her taste and style. She says her garments can be dressed up or down, and are the epitome of transitional summer style . Collaboration: The dancer says she was delighted to design a seven piece range for the brand - 'I have hand-picked all the fabrics and colours and am really pleased with the designs,' she added . 'The £44.50  jumpsuits are perfect for the coolest daytime festival or beach look and can be dressed up with heels for the evening for effortless glamour. I love the movement that these outfits allow, the fabrics are so cool and don’t restrict your body. 'They complement the female figure, especially the one size fits all genie jumpsuits.' Dancing Leopard, which aims to create ideal designs for women who want freedom, functionality and fashion, are thrilled to have Kimberly on board. 'The Dancing Leopard team is so excited to be collaborating with Kimberly, we instantly loved the concept of her collection and it's been a really fun project for us. 'Kimberly has a down to earth nature and a great sense of style and we feel that the beautiful movements philosophy fits with our brand perfectly,' they said. Summer style: She says that her designs are the perfect daytime festival or beach look and can be dressed up with heels for the evening for effortless glamour . Bold and graphic: Kimberly says she loves the movement that these outfits allow and, as she proves, can be dressed up with heels . The new range may come in handy after the star discovered she was pregnant while on honeymoon with husband Max Rogers, also 32, in New York in April. Their baby girl, is due in December. Clearly the snaps were taken before conceiving and Kimberly showcases her athletic figure that she'll no doubt regain after her pregnancy. The sporty star recently revealed that being a member of the Pussycat Dolls ignited her passion for fitness. She told Health & Fitness magazine: 'There was a lot of pressure from the management label to stay in shape. I knew we were replaceable, so the pressure of wanting to stay in the group kept me in the gym.' The Dolls would usually have a group gym session before starting dance practice and she and close friend and fellow bandmate Ashley Roberts would do circuit training together as well. The 32-year-old does, however, admit that it's harder to stay in shape these days explaining that she's had to find a routine that fits her busy schedule. Kimberly works out three to five times a week, incorporating hot yoga three times a week for an hour and a half, as well as dance and circuit training. Busy bee: As well as working on her toned physique, Kimberly has been focussing on her DJing and has been working with Maxinutrition, promoting the fit and healthy lifestyle that she loves . When she's over in Los Angeles, she loves to play volleyball outside and says she really enjoyed trying the winter sports she was challenged to on the TV show The Jump. 'Exercise absolutely has to work with my life and be something I can live with,' she said. 'It's a priority because it's a source of stress relief and fuels my determination. It's all about keeping my workouts mixed and having something to look forward to.' As well as working on her toned physique, Kimberly has been focussing on her DJing and has been working with Maxinutrition, promoting the fit and healthy lifestyle that she loves. She has also been filming for the next series of TV show Got To Dance, which airs in August, and her make-up company, Beautiful Movement Cosmetics, will be going into Holland & Barrett stores.

Dinesh Kaurav, 35, has kept his 65-year-old father Churaman and his brother Suresh, 21, chained because he claims they had become a danger to themselves and others. They were diagnosed with mental health issues in 1994. As the eldest son the responsibility of their care fell on Dinesh and he tried to get medical help from the government. Scroll down for video . The father and son were chained up after they became aggressive and medical treatment couldn't be afforded . Churaman Kaurav, 65, and his son Suresh, 21, were diagnosed with mental health issues in 1994 . Dinesh Kaurav said he had no choice to keep them chained as he did not have enough money to buy medicine . But eventually he said the pair began to get aggressive and Dinesh felt he had no choice but keep them safe by chaining them inside their home, in a remote village, in Indore, Madhya Pradesh. Dinesh said: ‘I tried my best to have my father and brother treated at government hospitals, but I did not have enough money to buy medicines. ‘Then they were becoming aggressive and it was difficult for us to take care of them. They would pelt stones at villagers and sometimes walk out of the house and go missing. It was for their safety that I thought to chain them otherwise they may hurt themselves or others. I had no other choice.’ Even though the father and son are chained, Dinesh and his mother, Naram, 60, take care of them every minute of every day and feed and bath them daily. Dinesh added: ‘While I’m at work my mother keeps an eye on them. She helps them with everything, we never leave them alone.  They spend their days sleeping but sometimes we leave them free to move from the bedroom to the backyard.’ He and his mother take care of the two, feeding and washing them daily . He tried to get help from the government's district administration but it refused . But now thanks to village help and protests, the administration has assured help in the nearest hospital . Dinesh works as a daily labourer, picking up work where he can, earning about 3,000 Rs a month (£30). He lives in a two-room house with his wife, mother and mentally ill father and son.

But thanks to village support and protests the administration has now stepped in and has assured their assistance with medical care in the nearest specialized hospital. Rajesh Shah, a local government officer, said: 'The family came to us for help because they couldn’t pay for medical treatment, that's when we included them in the government’s list for subsidies. But if Dinesh needs further help, we will be here to help as much as we can.' The family encompassing Duresh and his wife, his mother, brother and father, live in a two room house .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Next time you want to lose weight, try watching a nail-biting thriller. Researchers have found that more exciting a show is, the less likely women are to binge on calorie-laden food. A dull show, on the other hand, increases the risk of gorging on unhealthy snacks by 52 per cent. Women who watch 'boring' TV shows are 52 per cent more likely to binge as they watch, a study found . Scientists from Uppsala University in Sweden studied 18 women, analysing them as they snacked and watched a range of different programmes. The women were shown an 'engaging' episode of a popular Swedish comedy show, reported Prevention.com, as well as a 'boring' art lecture. As a control the scientists also monitored bingeing habits while the women took part in another 'boring' activity - reading a text on insects living in Sweden. Their findings revealed that boring content increased a women's propensity to snack on unhealthy foods. Instead, women watching TV should opt for healthy snacks, replacing crisps with vegetables, say the researchers . While watching 'dull' shows, the women . taking part binged on 52 per cent more food than during the . 'entertaining' comedy programme. And the trend held up across different media, the researchers found. Participants ate 35 per cent less when watching the 'engaging' episode on TV, compared with reading about insects. The findings have prompted the team of scientists to question whether it is in fact how exciting or engaging the TV we watch is, rather than the act itself, that causes a person to eat more. 'At very low levels of . engagement, you kind of eat to engage yourself because you’re bored,' said Aner Tal, a research associate at Cornell University’s Food and . Brand Lab. 'It might also have to do with the pacing.' But he said the key is to ensure you choose healthy snacks while settling on the sofa for a night in front of the TV. He added: 'Use pre-portioned snacks as opposed to endless bowls. 'That means keeping the source of food out of sight, too. 'If you know you have a tendency to overeat while watching TV just snack on something that’s better for you. Have veggies as a snack instead of chips.'","Researchers at Uppala University in Sweden studied a group of women as they snacked in front of a range of different programmes .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Your pet may enjoy exploring your neighbourhood, but after it dies, it could go on the ultimate adventure in space and even set paw on the moon. The world’s ‘most unique pet memorial service in the universe’ lets owners launch their pets’ ashes into orbit and even deep space aboard spacecraft, as soon as this autumn. The new service has four service options, which start at $995 (£590). While some people may assume that owners would be barking mad to shell out for such a lavish memorial, the company, Celestis Pets, claims the missions are one way to ‘honour our animal companions’. The incredible journey: The world's 'most unique pet memorial service in the universe' (illustrated) lets owners launch their pets' ashes into orbit and even deep space aboard spacecraft as soon as this autumn. There are four options ranging from orbiting the Earth to journeying into deep space . ‘Your best friend was an explorer in life. With Celestis Pets, they can travel forever in the stars,’ the company says. Since 1995 Houston-based Celestis has conducted memorial spacecrafts carrying human remains to the moon and letting them drift through space, but the pet service is a new addition, which the firm says has been requested by owners of beloved animals. Owners can choose from four spaceflight options, the cheapest of which is the Earth Rise service, at $995. Homeward bound: The Earth orbit Service launches remains into Earth's orbit where they vapourise 'like a shooting star' This option will see a ‘symbolic portion’ of cremated remains go to space and after ‘experiencing the zero gravity environment,’ return to Earth. The capsule will even be returned to the pet’s family. While it may be easy to imagine an urn zooming through space, the ‘portion’ refers to approximately one gram of ashes or a lock of the pet’s hair. The pricier Earth Orbit Service costs from $4,995 (£2,961) and launches pets’ remains into space aboard a ‘real space mission alongside a commercial satellite. It will be placed in Earth orbit where it will stay before re-entering the atmosphere, vapourising like a shooting star ‘as a final tribute’. A Luna service, starting at $12,500 (£7,410) could leave the ashes of a pet on the moon, while the Voyager Service at the same price, could see a pet journey through the stars into deep space ‘to explore places they could only have dreamed of in life’. The company goes so far as to say that a spacecraft memorial could ‘meanfully contribute to the future life on Earth’. ‘Every Celestis Pets mission is part of a rapidly growing space industry and gives us valuable knowledge about space travel, our universe and perhaps one day the origins of life on Earth,’ the website says. Star gazing: A Luna service, starting at $12,500 ($7,400) could leave the ashes of a pet on the moon, while the Voyager Service at the same price, could see a pet journey through the stars into deep space 'to explore places they could only have dreamed of in life,' the company said . Earth Rise: The service launches ‘a symbolic portion of cremated remains’ into space and after experiencing the zero gravity environment, returns the individual flight capsules back to Earth.The capsules are recovered and the remains returned to the pets' owners. It costs from $995 (£590). Earth Orbit: Costing from $4,995 (£2,961) the ashes travel aboard a spacecraft on a ‘real space mission’ alongside a satellite. It orbits the Earth before re-entering the atmosphere where it vaporises ‘like a shooting star in final tribute’. Luna: The service takes pets’ cremated remains to the moon from $12,500 (£7,410). Celestis first offered this service to humans in 1999 when it received a request from Nasa to assist the family of Dr Eugene Shoemaker to leave some of this ashes aboard the Nasa Lunar Prospector mission. Voyager: The ultimate pet adventurer can take a tour of deep space from $12,500 (£7,410). Ashes will be places aboard a craft that leaves the Earth-moon system on a permanent celestial journey. The next missions will embark in autumn this year.","Houston-based firm Celestis is offering four options from $995 (£590)

"By . Jon Rees . More than two million customers have saved a total of £400 million by switching from the Big Six energy firms to smaller, independent suppliers, figures reveal. Energy UK, which represents the energy industry, said that the rate at which householders switched from the big firms – EDF, British Gas, E.On, Npower, Scottish Power and SSE – to smaller providers had risen dramatically. In June last year, 36,876 customers swapped to small suppliers. That soared to 126,979 by November and remains high, with an average of just over 100,000 a month changing by the end of June. More than two million customers have saved a total of £400 million by switching from the Big Six energy firms to smaller, independent suppliers, figures reveal (file picture) In total, 2.05 million customers now get their energy from smaller firms, saving about £200 a year. The figures cover electricity switching only, but about 80 per cent of those who swap electricity switch gas, too. Last autumn, the leading energy companies put their prices up, while Labour leader Ed Miliband pledged to freeze prices for 20 months if elected next year. The Government responded by promising to slash bills by loosening environmental levies. These added more than £100 to the annual average dual fuel bill, which stands at £1,346, up from £819 five years ago. Ann Robinson, director of consumer policy at price comparison website uSwitch.com, said: ‘Small energy providers do benefit from lower costs and lower government levies. However, companies like First Utility has increased its market share above this and continues to offer the most competitive deals.’ Energy Secretary Ed Davey added: ‘We have almost trebled the number of small suppliers since 2010 and our reforms are making it easier and quicker for people to switch suppliers.’","Millions save total of £400m by switching from Big Six energy firms .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans For Mailonline . An electronic cigarette advert featuring the slogan 'Love Your Lungs' has been banned for implying they were beneficial to users' health. Watchdogs launched an investigation into the LeoLites poster campaign after receiving a complaint it suggested . that there was evidence the e-cigarettes were not harmful. Manufacturers E&L Distribution argued there was no health claim being made as the advert did not state that the products would improve users’ health or benefit the health of their lungs. Banned: This LeoLites advert has been banned for implying its e-cigarettes were beneficial to users' health . They added that they had wanted the slogan to be catchy, alliterative and relevant to both the product and the action of inhaling vapour into the lungs. However, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) found the advert to be in breach of its rules regarding misleading advertising and substantiation and banned it from being used again. An ASA spokesman said: 'Within the context of the ad, we considered that consumers, particularly those who were existing smokers, were likely to interpret the claim ""Love Your Lungs"" as meaning that LeoLites e-cigarettes contained properties that were not harmful to their lungs or that they would experience an improvement in the health of their lungs if they used LeoLites products.' Ruling: Watchdogs also concluded that the advert could suggest that LeoLite products were less harmful to users' lungs than traditional cigarettes (pictured) or other brands of e-cigarettes . The spokesman added that the advert could suggest that LeoLites products were less harmful to users' lungs than traditional cigarettes or other brands of e-cigarettes. He said: 'We also considered that the claim could also be interpreted to mean that consumers should ""love their lungs"" by switching from traditional cigarettes, or, given the inclusion of the phrase ""e-cigarettes have evolved"", from other brands of e-cigarettes to LeoLites products. 'The wording of the ad suggested a comparison between using LeoLites products and traditional cigarettes or other brands of e-cigarettes, that implied LeoLites products were less harmful to users’ lungs. 'We noted that we had not seen any evidence to demonstrate that LeoLites products were beneficial to the health of users’ lungs or that the products were less harmful than traditional cigarettes or other brands of e-cigarettes, as implied in the ad. 'On this basis, we considered the claim ""love your lungs"" had not been substantiated and concluded the ad was misleading.' He added: 'We told LeoLites to ensure that they did not use the claim ""love your lungs"" or make any claims that implied their products were not harmful or were beneficial to the health of users’ lungs in future ads, unless they held robust evidence to substantiate the claims.' A LeoLites spokesman said today: 'It was never the intention of LeoLites to make a health claim with the slogan ""Love your lungs"". It was an alliterative tagline that was intended to grab attention, and the obvious connotations associated with Lungs and vaping. 'We apologise if there was any confusion about this message, as that was never our intention. 'We will continue to sell our products in an aim to help people switch from smoking tobacco. In future we will try to ensure any advertising campaigns will be less ambiguous to the public.'","LeoLites poster features slogan 'Love Your Lungs' with photo of e-cigarette .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard for MailOnline . You might want to keep your fear of flying in check next time you're at an airport. A new camera being developing in China aims to highlight highly-anxious people in the hopes of catching suicide bombers. The device uses a stress sensor that measures the amount of oxygen in blood in various parts of the body, such as the face, to pick out suspects in a crowd. The device was inspired by recent deadly attacks in public places in China. For instance, in March eight knife-wielding criminals in the city of Kunming, Yunnan left 29 civilians dead and over 140 others injured (pictured) The device is currently under development at China's Southwest University in Chongqing and was inspired by recent deadly attacks in the country. In March, eight knife-wielding criminals in the city of Kunming, Yunnan left 29 civilians dead and over 140 others injured . 'They all looked and behaved as ordinary people but their level of mental stress must have been extremely high before they launched their attacks,' Chen Tong, an associate professor of electronic information engineering at Southwest University told Stephen Chen at South China Morning Post. The device uses a stress sensor that measures the amount of oxygen in blood in various parts of the body, such as the face, to pick out suspects in a crowd . 'The higher the mental stress, the higher the blood oxygenation. Our technology can detect such people, so law enforcement officers can take precautions and prevent these tragedies.' When the body is stress it releases hormones such as epinephrine and cortisol which increase strength and concentration. Heart speeds up, sending more blood and oxygen to your muscles so you can take the body can take 'fight or flight' action as soon as possible. Chronic stress, or a constant stress experienced over a prolonged period of time, can contribute to long-term health problems for the heart and blood vessels. Other indicators of stress, such as changes in heart rate and facial expression, can be controlled with practice, which is why the researchers chose to focus on the level of blood oxygenation. The camera uses something known as hyperspectral imaging which examines information across the electromagnetic spectrum and can pick out oxygen levels. The more stressed you are, the more oxygen is in your body. Professor Tong explained that the mini-cameras would place a 'stress bar' above a person's head to help police officers monitor suspicious behaviour. He added that device would be able to tell the difference between high-oxygen levels in the blood caused by moderate exercise, such as running, and oxygen levels caused by stress. The technology is still at development stage and requires improvements in computing power to fit into a handheld device. Even if the technical problems are overcome, Professor Chen says that the device will not be launched for commercial use until laws exist in China to govern its use.

But this cheeky group of primates at Twycross Zoo in Warwickshire displayed a surprising enthusiasm when a photographer left her camera in their paddock. Scroll down for video . Strike a pose: The little lemur stares intently at his subject as he stands behind a camera left in his paddock . The next David Bailey? Their approach to photography was unusual as they soon took to climbing on the tripod . Eyeballing the state-of-the-art Canon, left on its tripod, the three lemurs leaped from a branch to investigate this unusual toy. And one of them seemed intense and serious as he directed the camera at his chosen subject. However, their approach quickly descended into something more... unusual. One climbed on top of the camera, before jumping down in a bid to pull off the lens cap. Eventually one looked like he was going to take a snap - but thought better of it and started swinging around the tripod. Fascinated: The group seemed perfectly content twisting the lens of this state-of-the-art Canon camera . Should you be doing that? This one was perhaps too comfortable clawing at the expensive equipment . Lemurs are an old group of primates which evolved in near isolation after Madagascar split away from the African mainland. They filled the ecological niches occupied by monkeys, the dominant primates, on mainland Africa. As there was no competition from monkeys on Madagascar, lemurs soon came to dominate its rainforests, until boats started to arrive around 2,000 years ago and human hunters arrived. Lemur size ranges from the world's smallest primate to - until fairly recently - some of its largest, the sloth lemurs, which rivalled gorillas in size. Budding snappers: The animals surveyed the camera ahead of the zoo's annual photography competition . Yesterday's display of photography from this collection of lemurs comes as the zoo prepares for its annual photography competition, which closes at the end of August. Judges include Bill Oddie, Chris Breen and Alice Roberts. For more information and to enter, visit www.twycrosszoo.org.","Group of lemur monkeys at Twycross Zoo left intrigued by camera .

"By . Emily Payne . A luxury hotel in a former Victorian sea fort a mile off the Hampshire coast, in the middle of the busy Solent, is set to open this autumn. No Man's Land Fort, where more than 100 soldiers once slept in hammocks and endured spartan living conditions defending England against foreign invaders, will be a four-and-a-half star chill-out base equipped with a helipad. Amazing Venues, set up by entrepreneur Mike Clare, already runs a similar exclusive hotel at neighbouring Spitbank Fort. No invaders here: The former sea fort is a mile off the Hampshire coast, in the middle of the busy Solent . He says the new hotel will open in October in No Man's Land Fort, one of a chain built a mile from Portsmouth Harbour to guard us against the French fleet in 1878. Mark Watts, Solent Forts' general manager, said the 22 bedrooms for 200 guests in the new hotel are being completed ahead of its opening later this year. 'It is going extremely well - on Spitbank we are 100 per cent full until November. 'Every day we are full to capacity. That is what has spurred us on to move No Man's Land Fort forward.' Transformation: More than 100 soldiers once endured spartan living conditions while stationed in this sea fort . The opening of the new hotel will mean a change for the existing, five-star Spitbank Fort, which will become an exclusive-use venue. 'We have done that because the new hotel is going to be so much larger,' said Mark. 'It will be three times the size of Spitbank and an awful lot more room for guests. 'There are bigger rooms, and there is a special atrium in the middle of the building. 'We are putting in fun things like laser quest and virtual golf practice and we will have a cabaret bar and lots of other new things.' Unique: The unusual, luxury hotel will have capacity for 200 guests in 22 rooms . Around 80 staff are set to work on the fort, with a further 40 already employed at Spitbank Fort. Portsmouth City council recently approached investors to try to secure more exclusive hotels for the city. Councillor Donna Jones, leader of the council, said: 'Portsmouth has so much to offer the high-end market. 'I'm delighted that Mike Clare has invested so heavily by acquiring forts in the Solent. 'My desire is to have another five-star hotel in Portsmouth to accommodate the America's Cup and preliminary races that Sir Ben Ainslie will take part in.' The existing five-star Spitbank Fort, will become an exclusive-use venue when the new hotel opens . Councillor Luke Stubbs, cabinet member for planning and regeneration, added: 'It is giving the local economy a boost to have another premium hotel in the city.' The forts were fitted with massive cannons to repel the French Navy. Now the gun ports are bedroom windows offering sea views and the gunpowder rooms are cosy snugs. Blitzed by Nazi bombers during World War Two, the forts were decommissioned by the Ministry of Defence in 1982. Fifteen foot granite walls will protect guests from the roughest of weather. Rooms in the basement contain artefacts including giant bellows used to heat up the forge and a large muzzle cleaner. Outside, visitors can take in the sea air and fish for mackerel, bass and pollock which swim in the waters surrounding the fort. Where anti-aircraft guns once stood, there's a sun deck where guests and wedding parties sipping champagne and eating canapes can watch boats passing in and out of Portsmouth Harbour. There's even a hot tub on the roof terrace and a crow's nest bar.","Sister property to popular neighbouring Spitbank fort to open in Autumn .

"By . Ian Drury for the Daily Mail . Arriving at Gatwick laden with luggage, they look like any other tourists setting off on a fortnight’s holiday to Turkey. In reality, the smiling Britons captured on CCTV were heading to Syria to fight their so-called ‘holy war’. Muhammad Hamidur Rahman, 25, Mashadur Choudhury, 31, Assad Uzzaman, 25, Mehdi Hassan, 19, and Mamunur Roshid had booked cheap tickets on a Thomas Cook flight to the Turkish resort of Antalya on October 8. Scroll down for video . Chilling: . CCTV footage has emerged which reportedly shows five British jihadis . walking through Gatwick Airport on their way to Syria. Second left is . Mashadur Choudhury, far right is Muhammad Hamidur Rahman . Different . fates: Mashadur Choudhury, 31 (left) returned weeks later and became . the first Briton to be convicted over the current conflict in Syria. Former Primark worker Muhammad Rahman (right) was killed while fighting . Calling themselves the Britani Brigade Bangladeshi Bad Boys, the fanatics, all from Portsmouth, had been seduced by glamorous tales of martyrdom to join Islamic State – formerly Isis – establishing a Muslim caliphate in the Middle East. Today Rahman, a shop assistant at Primark until he was sacked, is reportedly dead, killed in a gun battle last month. Meanwhile, Choudhury, a one-time council official turned swindler who enjoyed using £200-a-night prostitutes, is languishing in a British jail. He failed the selection process to join Isis and was thrown out of its training camp in disgrace. On his return, he was arrested and became the first Briton to be found guilty of travelling to Syria to fight in the civil war. The whereabouts of the other three are unclear, but they are still thought to be fighting with IS. A different kind of holiday: The group of men walking down a corridor of Gatwick Airport as they left for Turkey . The ease with which they were able to . slip over Turkey’s porous border with Syria has caused alarm in the . West and prompted calls to Ankara to make sure it is closed. Up to 30 radicalised Britons a month . are now travelling to Syria and Iraq across the frontier – dubbed the . Jihad Express – that has become a gateway to IS. The number has increased markedly in . the last ten weeks as the profile of the group has been raised by its . well-run propaganda machine and catalogue of barbaric crimes. Monitoring and electronic surveillance . has shown that far from putting would-be recruits off, the beheadings . and other atrocities are drawing more people to join IS. Intelligence agencies fear the number . of Britons and other Europeans going to fight could increase further if . IS extremists succeed in securing a stretch of the Turkish border with . north-western Syria as a safe area through which recruits can safely . travel. Toll: At least one of the men who is reportedly pictured in the footage has since been killed, said his father . Disturbingly, a large force of extremists is reported to be moving towards the border in convoys of armoured trucks captured from Iraqi military forces. Their goal is to provide a guaranteed gateway through which new fighters can pass safely. The 130-mile frontier has so far been key to allowing recruits into Syria, as well as smuggled oil and weapons. Much of the border area is difficult to patrol or to police, a mixture of rugged mountain passes and plains over which an estimated 800 to 1,000 Britons have travelled. It is also the route used by most of the 250 Britons whom officials say have returned to the UK. A British jihadist feared to be one of the militants behind US journalist James Foley’s killing boasted of how simple it was to sneak unseen into Syria. Abu Abdullah al-Britani was asked by a reporter posing as a potential fighter whether he faced problems if he flew from Britain to Turkey before illegally crossing the border. The jihadist replied: ‘Na, it’s pretty easy.’ IS’s UK recruits are told how to leave Britain – always travelling to Turkey via two other countries to avoid suspicion. They are also told who to contact in Turkey and which hotels and safe houses to use. Some travel as tourists but many  end up at Hatay airport, ten miles from the border with Syria. Once safely in accommodation they make contact using a telephone number or email address. Within 48 hours they are usually picked up by motorcycle or taxi and taken across the border to IS training camps. Unofficial operations are on-going to track the militants in the border area. Intelligence services are monitoring Britons and other foreign fighters but Turkey has been reluctant to stop anyone from crossing. For months it has allowed weapons and supplies destined for recognised Syrian opposition groups to cross. European governments have been frustrated that little appears to have been done. Dr Hisham al-Hashimi, an Iraqi expert on IS, said: ‘The Turkish border is the only way to smuggle oil, weapons and foreign fighters in. 'If it is closed, it will cut three things: funding, an entrance for the foreign fighters and links to Europe which they are trying to open.’","Brits booked cheap tickets to Turkish resort of Antalya on October 8 .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . It has become one of the most controversial topics in the world of travel – the presence of giant cruise ships in Venice, and fears over the harm these liners may cause to the famous city. And the battle lines have long been drawn. For the cruise industry, the great Italian island citadel is one of the world’s foremost destinations – a place that adds an elegance and a sense of history to any long voyage. No more: Oscar winners Michael Douglas and Cate Blanchett are calling for a ban on cruise ships in Venice . Size versus substance: The presence of large cruise ships in Venice has become increasingly controversial . On the other side are those who think the liners are enormous, incongruous intruders into a place that was never designed to host such ocean goliaths. Now, a powerful band of celebrities – including Hollywood icons, writers, fashion designers, A-list journalists, architects and royals - have thrown their weight behind an appeal to have the liners banished from Venice on a permanent basis. Taking a firm stand: Film stars Sir Michael Caine and Diane Lane have added their names to the petition . Making their point: Other Hollywood stars, including Harvey Keitel and Susan Sarandon, have signed the letter . Leading figures from the world of cinema – including Oscar winners Cate Blanchett, Tilda Swinton and Michael Douglas – have added their signatures to a petition, addressed to the Italian prime minister and the Italian minister of culture and tourism, calling for an end to the sight of liners dwarfing buildings such as St Mark’s Basilica. Other big-screen figures are also on . the list of endorsees, including Rob Lowe, Diane Lane, Sir Michael . Caine, Edward Norton, Susan Sarandon and Isabella Rossellini. Julie . Christie, whose most iconic film – the 1973 supernatural thriller Don’t . Look Now – was set in Venice, is another of the cinema set to add her . voice. No big ships: Demonstrators have been increasingly vocal about the presence of cruise ships in Venice . Other luminaries include architect Sir Norman Foster, Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter and Princess Firyal of Jordan – plus an illustrious line-up of fashion designers including Diane von Furstenberg, Carolina Herrera, Hubert de Givenchy and Calvin Klein. All these names appear on a plea sent to Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi and his culture minister Dario Franceschini. Making a splash: Opponents of cruise ships in Venice protested in the Giudecca Canal last year . It reads: . 'Dear Prime Minister, dear Minister, . Having prevailed against flood, pestilence, and war for more than thirteen centuries, Venice, the Queen of the Adriatic, and unparalleled UNESCO Word Heritage site, now, in a moment of relative tranquility, finds herself mortally threatened by the daily transit of gargantuan ocean liners, indifferent to the probable risk of catastrophe. Since the flood of 1966, Italy and countless Italian and international supporters have contributed to the defense of the world's most fragile city, eternally subject to destruction. The absolute lack of respect presented by the outlandish spectacle of the ongoing obstruction and potentially destruction, of one of humanity’s pre-eminent monuments is not only dumbfounding but both morally and culturally unacceptable. We urgently request an immediate and irrevocable halt to the traffic of the Big Ships in front of San Marco and along the Giudecca Canal putting an end to this senseless devastation.' The letter is first signed by Umberto Marcello del Majno, who is described as the ‘Chairman of the Association of the International Private Committees for the Safeguarding of Venice,’ and ‘co-manager of the Joint Programme with UNESCO’. Not so ship-shape? When bigger liners approach Venice, the buildings of the medieval city seem dwarfed . Venice has already made moves to restrict the movements of cruise ships in its waters. January brought a reduction of 20 per cent on the number of ships weighing more than 40,000 tonnes authorised to enter the Giudecca Canal (the waterway which separates the main core of Venice from the separate island of Giudecca, immediately to the south). Sailing into the past: Will images such as this soon be consigned to yesteryear? Further regulations which were due to come into force in November, have now been put back to January 2015. These will see the biggest cruise ships – liners of over 96,000 tonnes – banned from sailing in the Giudecca Canal. The proposals, announced late last year, were hailed as a triumph by the mayor of Venice, Giorgio Orsoni. Calming the storm - for now: Restrictions on cruise ships in Venice were introduced earlier this year . ‘Finally, the trend towards gigantic ships has been turned around,’ Mr Orsoni commented. ‘We have had enough of these mega cruise ships just metres away from San Marco. ‘From now on, there will be clear limits on the size of ships that can enter Venice.’","Stars of film and fashion join forces to call for ban on cruise ships in Venice .

"By . David Baker . Updated: . 18:10 GMT, 28 January 2012 . Convinced: US Defence Secretary Leon Panetta is adamant that the Pakistani government knew about Bin Laden's remote hiding place . Pakistan officials must have known that terror chief Bin Laden was holed up in a remote compound in Abbottabad, claims Pentagon chief Leon Panettta. The Defence Secretary has publicly hit out at the Pakistani . government who he says 'must have had some sense' of Osama Bin Laden's whereabouts. He said he remains convinced they must have known someone of interest was hiding out in the safe-house in an interview for CBS's '60 Minutes', but added he has no proof. The . explosive interview, to be broadcast tomorrow, also saw Panetta . acknowledge for the first time that Pakistani doctor Shakil Afridi had . provided key information about the former Al Qaeda frontman's whereabouts. Afridi . ran a vaccination program for the CIA to collect DNA and verify Bin . Laden's presence in the hideout and Panetta confessed he is 'very . concerned' for the doctor who has been charged by Pakistan with treason. Since . the May 2 attack on Bin Laden's compound, last year, Pakistani leaders . have continued to deny they had any idea Bin Laden was staying in the . city. This is despite revelations that he had been hiding at the site for as long as five years. For months the CIA knew of his . presence there and spied on him from its own top-secret safe-house next . door to the terror leader's fortified compound, before Navy Seals were . sent in. Hiding: Osama Bin Laden watching television at his remote compound in Abbottabad before he was killed at the hide-out . Raided: Pakistani security officials granted access to journalists to cover the compound where Osama Bin Laden was killed . Remote: A Pakistani security official passes by the Bin Laden's compound .

Although . he saw the terror chief killed by a single bullet to the head, it was . only when he received the . signal 'Geronino E-KIA' - which stands for . 'Enemy Killed In Action'- that he knew Bin Laden was dead. It had . been claimed the terror chief used a woman thought to be his wife as a . human shield - but this was retracted by officials. The White House also confirmed he was unarmed when the compound was stormed. Shortly . after the raid security forces announced they had arrested 40 people in . Abbottabad, suspected of having connections to Osama Bin Laden . This . gave rise to growing accusations the Pakistani government must have . been aware he was using the base as a safe house, given the network of . support he had there.

It had stealth features on board and they wanted to keep sensitive technology out of enemy hands, according to U.S. officials. But Pakistan's unwillingness to return the aircraft immediately drew further criticism from government chiefs.

"By . Carol Driver . Laura Skywalker Matthews added the Jedi middle name by deed poll in 2008 ¿for a laugh¿ . A Star Wars fan missed out on her summer holiday after she was refused a passport because she changed her name to Skywalker. Laura Skywalker Matthews added the Jedi middle name by deed poll in 2008 ‘for a laugh’ after joking with friends about her love of lead character Luke Skywalker. But the joke backfired when officials took eight weeks to refuse her passport application - meaning Miss Matthews missed out on a summer break to Amsterdam. The 29-year-old was told by passport officials that her new signature L Skywalker infringed on a trademark - despite it previously having been accepted for her driving licence. She said: ‘It's absolutely ridiculous. They told me the issue was with my signature because L Skywalker is trademark. ‘I have the same signature on my driving licence, bank cards and everything else. ‘How can everybody else be happy with that signature, apart from the passport office? ‘Luke Skywalker is a trademark but not my signature “L Skywalker”. ‘It's been extremely stressful trying to sort all this out and I've now missed my trip to Amsterdam. ‘The whole application process has been an utter shambles from start to finish. ‘I never knew a little joke between friends was going to cause this many problems.’ Miss Matthews sent off for a new passport in May ahead of a pre-planned trip to Amsterdam on July 16. But despite numerous calls to follow up the application, she was only told this week that her application had been refused. Scroll down for video . 'Really stressful': Confirmation of Laura's name change, which the passport office has said breaches trademark restrictions . The home claims adviser, who lives with her partner Darren Stewart, 30, at their home in Southend, Essex, said: ‘I changed my name by deed poll back in 2008. ‘I really like Star Wars and me and a friend were joking about what silly name we would have if we could choose one. ‘I just did it for a laugh as it only cost £49. It's just a middle name so I never realised it was going to cause all this fuss. ‘I've been chasing the passport office up since the beginning of July but they have been hopeless.’ Star Wars fan: Laura changed her middle name to Skywalker after Mark Hamill's (pictured left with Carrier Fisher and Harrison Ford) character . Miss Matthews has since been told she will need to reapply for a new passport with her old signature. She added: ‘I just wish they had told me all this sooner so I didn't have to miss out on my holiday. ‘They knew this was a problem at the beginning of July - if they had told me then I might have been able to sort it out in time. ‘Now I am going to have a driving licence with one signature and a passport with another.‘The whole situation is a complete mess.’ A Home Office spokesman said they ‘will not recognise a change to a name which is subject to copyright or trademark’.

"By . Wills Robinson . Star Wars actor Mark Hamill has arrived in the Republic of Ireland to film scenes for the upcoming Episode VII sporting his beard and greying hair. The 62-year-old, who played Luke Skywalker in the original series, has grown the facial hair for his return to the series which is currently being filmed in County Kerry. He was spotted in between sets outside the Butler Arms Hotel in the village of Waterville which has been taken over by sci-fi fans wanting to catch a glimpse of the cast. New look: Mark Hamill, 62 (left), who last played Luke Skywalker 30 years ago (right), was pictured in County Kerry, Ireland, taking a break from filming Star Wars: Episode VII . A helicopter used for shooting film lands in a field near Portmagee, County Kerry where work on the new Star Wars: Episode VII has begun . The hotel is on the coast, close to the UNESCO Heritage site Skellig Michael, which has been closed to the public for the last three days for filming. Fishing vessels have been told not to sail the island off the coast of County Kerry, so they do not disrupt the cast and crew during production. Hamill revealed last week that he had to grow the beard for the seventh film and described his casting as 'an unexpected gift'. 'I thought even if they did a third trilogy, we couldn't be involved because it's really about the new generation of characters,' he said.

'You know we're just there to lend our support and grow contractually obligated beards. It was certainly unexpected. He added: 'I already had a beginning, middle and end. I never thought we'd come back. To go on to those sets that evoked so many memories, it is just astonishing. It just seems like an unexpected gift.' The cast, director JJ Abrams, and the enormous crew, all arrived on the Northern Ireland coast yesterday to begin filming on location. It is understood that at least 12 private boat operators have had their services booked up for the days of the shoot as they ferry transported cast, crew, and equipment over to Skellig in the morning and back again last night.

All B&Bs and hotels in the area have been booked out for the week as a result. Yesterday, the team behind the shoot clashed with conservationists over their occupation of a remote island. Heritage chiefs and environmentalists have warned about the impact on the rocky outcrop. The steep island, which dramatically rises more than 700 feet out of the Atlantic Ocean, is home to puffins, manx shearwaters and storm petrels as well as Guillemots and Kittiwakes. Film director JJ Adams and actor Mark Hamill - who played Luke Skywalker in the original trilogy - are among the cast and crew on the set of the latest production, Star Wars: Episode VII. John O’Sullivan, of tourist company Skellig Experience, said on Thursday: ‘If the weather is fine, the camera work out there could be stunning. The scenery is spectacular up there. It’s a majestic and mysterious place.' On location: Filming has been taking place on Skellig Michael, a UNESCO Heritage Site off the coast of County Kerry, Ireland .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . Comedian Russell Kane has taken the Edinburgh Festival to new heights by performing a stand-up gig on a plane at 35,000ft. Kane, 33, who presents the BBC Three comedy series Live at the Electric, entertained passengers during their flight to Edinburgh from London Heathrow on Friday. His unique 10-minute show - dubbed the 'wry-high club' - transformed the Virgin Atlantic Little Red flight into the Edinburgh Festival Fringe's 300th venue. Taking off: Comedian Russell Kane gets ready to board the flight with Virgin Atlantic crew members . Joking around: Kane looked excited to  be boarding the special flight to Edinburgh . The airline laid on the surprise 'Little Red LIVE' gig to warm-up comedy lovers on their way to the festival and give those who can't attend a giggle. Russell shot to fame in 2006 when he performed his debut comedy show at the Edinburgh Fringe, which resulted in an Edinburgh Comedy award nomination. Since then, the Essex-based comedian has performed in front of thousands of fans, including a packed Hammersmith Apollo for the BBC's popular comedy programme Live at the Apollo. He was also nominated for the Edinburgh Comedy Awards at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, winning the main prize in August 2010. And his one-of-a-kind performance brightened up the Virgin Atlantic Little Red flight, which set off from Heathrow at 11.20am and arrived north of the border at 12.40pm. Captive audience: Once on board the comedian took charge of the PA system . The energetic comedian was worried about standing still for the show but the audience seemed to lap it up . Before take off, Kane tweeted: 'Apparently @beckieboom I have to speak into the @VirginAtlantic plane's in-flight PA system. I'LL HAVE TO STAND STILL. Waahhh' He later posted several 'selfies' with members of the crew and passengers before sending a message to the airline's owner Sir Richard Branson that said: 'I've been flirting with your staff @richardbranson @VirginAtlantic #LittleRedLive' Russell is the first of four comedians to take to the skies for 'Little Red LIVE' during August. Funnymen Carl Donnelly, Tom Craine and Richard Herring will also perform to a packed plane on August 8, 15 and 22 respectively. Sir Richard's service runs from London Heathrow to Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Manchester. Plane silly: Kane tweeted several selfies from on board the flight . Getting cheeky: Kane sent a message to Sir Richard Branson saying that he had been flirting with his staff . Sir Richard said: 'To follow the success of the first on-board live performances in 2013, we're providing our passengers with another great line-up of comedy gigs in true Virgin Atlantic style. 'This ensures we offer an unforgettable and inimitable flying experience. Virgin Atlantic Live: On Air reinforces again why our customer service is second to none.' Customers can win Little Red flights by telling their funniest joke on Virgin Atlantic's Facebook page using the hashtag #LittleRedLive. The 2014 Fringe will see 49,497 performances of 3,193 shows in 299 venues across Scotland’s capital city. According to organisers, the number of shows reflects an 11 per cent increase on last year’s programme, making it the biggest ever in the history of the Fringe.","Comedian entertained passengers during flight from London to Edinburgh .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Indiana Jones: Raiders Of The Lost Ark tops list of most re-watched films followed by Star Wars, both of which star Harrison Ford . Movie lovers typically rewatch their favourite film 29 times in their lifetime, according to research released today. Indiana Jones: Raiders of the Lost Ark tops the list of our most regularly re-watched films, followed closely by sci-fi classic Star Wars and Back to the Future. The study reveals 72 per cent enjoy revisiting their favourite films with 63 per cent noticing new things with each viewing. Another 48 per cent say rewatching movies cheers them up, while 29 per cent rewatch favourites movies to introduce a loved one to them. But modern day distractions such as buzzing smartphones and social media also cause us to forget film plots and misunderstand complicated movies. Around 65 per cent of Brits forget film plots after watching them once with 24 per cent admitting it takes a mere 24 hours to do so. And technology seems to be the problem with mobile multi-tasking, checking emails and social media  topping the list of distractions. Our loved ones are also guilty of causing us to lose the plot. Chattering partners asking questions about the film is a top frustration, stopping 39 per cent of viewers from concentrating properly. This may be the reason that 35 per cent of Brits admit fibbing when they’re asked if they understand a complicated film. Over half  of the 1,000 UK adults surveyed also admit regularly turning to sites like IMDB or Wikipedia to unravel complicated storylines. Psychologist Dr Dimitrios Tsivrikos from University College London said: 'With so much modern technology to distract us, it seems that when it comes to watching a film, we struggle to switch off and concentrate. Back To The Future comes in third as viewers reveal technology, including smartphones and social meida, are the most distracting things while trying to watch a film . 'There is only so much detail and drama the human brain can handle in one sitting, meaning attention levels will dip during the duration of a film. 'We may need to re-watch it a number of times to fully understand and appreciate it.' The research was commissioned by Sky Store Buy and Keep - a service which can download a HD movie to your TV to keep, allowing you to rewatch it time and time again. Nicole Bamford, Director of Sky Store, said: 'As the research has uncovered, we’re a nation of avid film watchers who like to watch on repeat.' 1. Indiana Jones: Raiders of the Lost Ark . 2. Star Wars . 3. Back to the Future . 4. Home Alone . 5. E.T. 6. Jaws . 7. Jurassic Park . 8. Independence Day . 9. Titanic . 10. Alien . To help the nation enjoy films even more, Sky Store enlisted film expert Alex Zane to recommend how many times the UK’s most rewatchable films should be revisited. Topping his list was Fight Club - which Alex recommends rewatching a staggering ten times for the ultimate viewing experience. Alex said: 'I love re-watching films, whether it’s for a nostalgia hit, or to try to get my head around an intriguing or complicated plotline. 'I find you notice so many new and different things each time you watch films. 'My list says goodbye to the traditional star rating and hello to the re-watchability rating. 'It looks at how many times you should watch a film to truly grasp the plot, connect with characters, experience every emotion and laugh at every joke.

"By . Chris Kitching . Brits who are heading abroad on their summer holidays may want to think twice about taking in the sights on a motorbike. That’s because a motorbike accident can lead to the most expensive injury claims – with the average medical bill topping £7,000 – for those who didn’t plan ahead and purchase a suitable travel insurance policy. A cycling accident (£6,262) and tripping on stairs (£2,422) are the second and third most expensive holiday mishaps, according to a study by TravelSupermarket. Incredibly risky: A quarter of Brits are travelling abroad without the protection of travel insurance . Released at the height of the summer travel season, the ‘holiday injury index’ calculated and compared healthcare costs for common injury claims in six popular destinations – Spain, Greece/Cyprus, Turkey, Egypt, Thailand and US/Canada. Of the five most expensive injuries, falling in a bathroom ranked fourth (£2,071) and slipping by the pool was fifth (£1,547). Holidaymakers will want to take care if they are riding a bicycle in North America. Uninsured Brits can face sky-high healthcare costs if they are injured in a cycling accident in the US or Canada . Falling off a bike in the US or Canada could result in painful medical bills of more than £18,000 – almost 18 times more than the same accident in Greece or Cyprus, the study found. If you’re bitten by an animal, it's best if it doesn’t occur in Spain. Medical treatment for a bite – one of the cheapest injuries to treat – is three times more expensive in Spain than it is in Turkey. There is some good news if you’re injured by broken glass in Thailand. That’s because you will spend 20 per cent less on medical costs than you would for the same injury in Greece or Cyprus. Holiday pain: An injury sustained in a fall in the bathroom costs an average of £2,071 in medical costs . Read the fine print: Analyse your travel insurance policy closely so that you know exactly what it covers . Bob Atkinson, travel expert at TravelSupermarket, said a quarter of Brits take the ‘incredibly risky’ step of travelling abroad without insurance. Many aren’t aware that when they travel within Europe the EHIC card only guarantees they will receive the same level of care as locals within the country they are visiting, Atkinson said. The level of care could be less comprehensive than the care they would receive in the UK. Atkinson said: ‘Without a travel insurance policy, you may end up having to pay for treatment with no possibility of recovering costs. ‘It’s really important that you pick the right travel insurance policy to suit your needs, whether you will be relaxing on a beach with a group of friends or going on a family holiday.’ He added: ‘Make sure that you don’t fall into the trap of thinking that you don’t need to get travel insurance if you are lying by a pool for a week, as you could be faced with high costs if you cut yourself on broken glass or slip in the bathroom after a day in the sun.’","Medical bills for a cycling accident in the US or Canada could top £18,000 .

"By . Helen Nicholson . As the Ebola outbreak worsens in West Africa, America’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has warned U.S. travellers to avoid non-essential trips to Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. The advice was a Level 3 travel warning, which is the strongest that can be issued. It comes as the first Ebola victim to be brought to the United States from Africa arrived in the country yesterday. An ambulance arrives with Ebola victim Dr Kent Brantly, pictured right, to Emory University Hospital, in Atlanta . Dr Kent Brantly working at an Ebola treatment clinic in Foya, Liberia. Brantly and Nancy Writebol contracted the disease while working there. He arrived back in the U.S. on Saturday for treatment . Along with advising passengers not to travel to affected countries, CDC . said it was assisting with active screening and education efforts in . West Africa to prevent infected travellers from boarding planes. If . an infected passenger does make it on to the flight, CDC said it had . protocols in place to protect against further spread of the disease, . including monitoring suspected infections during a 21-day ‘fever watch’ and then isolating anyone who develops the disease in quarantine. CDC . Director Tom Frieden said: ‘This is the biggest and most complex Ebola . outbreak in history. Far too many lives have been lost already. ‘It will take many months, and it won’t be easy, but Ebola can be stopped. We know what needs to be done. ‘CDC is surging our response, sending 50 additional disease control experts to the region in the next 30 days.’ Landed: An airplane carrying American doctor Kent Brantly who has the Ebola virus, arrives at Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta, Georgia, on August 2, 2014 . Dr Tom Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control, appeared on CNN today to re-assure the American public that they were not at risk from an Ebola outbreak . Dr. Kent Brantly, a missionary working in Liberia, was identified as the first American to be diagnosed with Ebola, which kills up to 80 per cent of those it infects. He was safely escorted into a specialized isolation unit at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, where doctors said they were confident the deadly virus won't escape. Nancy Writebol, 60, an educator turned missionary from Charlotte, North Carolina, was the second American to contract the disease in Liberia, and is expected to arrive in Atlanta tomorrow. Fears that the outbreak in Africa could spread in the U.S. has generated considerable anxiety among some Americans, but infectious disease experts said the public faces zero risk. CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden told The Associated Press that the centre had received ""nasty emails"" and at least 100 calls from people saying: 'How dare you bring Ebola into the country!?' ‘I hope that our understandable fear of the unfamiliar does not trump our compassion when ill Americans return to the U.S. for care,’ Dr Frieden said. He added: 'Ebola is a huge risk in Africa. It's not going to be a huge risk in the U.S.' The virus, which has gripped both Sierra Leone and Liberia (pictured) has also spread to neighbouring Guinea . Emirates has suspended flights to Conakry after there was an outbreak of Ebola in Guinea . The UK Government has not advised against travel to West Africa but said it was closely . monitoring the spread of the virus and was taking ""precautionary . measures"". It . claimed that Ebola was ""not an issue that affects the UK directly"" and said that the risk of the disease spreading in the UK was low thanks to the work of . experienced scientists and doctors at the Royal Free Infectious Disease . Unit, the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and the London School of . Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Despite . fears over flights still operating into and out of West Africa - often . with direct routes to London - the Foreign Office claims Border Staff . have been trained to recognise symptoms. A . statement from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) read: 'Border . Force has been working closely with Public Health England and other . agencies to ensure staff are prepared to deal with the threat of the . Ebola virus. 'As . part of this planning, guidance has been issued to front line staff on . how to identify and safely deal with suspected cases of Ebola that makes . clear what steps need to be taken should a passenger arrive at the . border unwell. 'If . a person is identified at the border as being a potential carrier of . Ebola they will be immediately referred by a Border Force officer to a . specialist medical care provider and reported to the Public Health . England.' Guinea's capital Conakry will not be serviced by Emirates flights until further notice . British Airways has confirmed it will continue to run its route to Liberia and Sierra Leone . Last week, Emirates announced that it had suspended flights to Guinea over fears of spreading the Ebola virus. The . Dubai-based carrier is the first major international airline to cancel . flights due to the epidemic which has taken hold in West Africa. However, . British Airways continues to operate its flight from Liberia to London . Heathrow, which also stops at Lungi International Airport in Sierra . Leone. Emirates confirmed the decision to suspend flights to Conakry came after there was an outbreak of the virus in Guinea. The . suspension of the route follows a similar decision by Pan-African . airlines Arik and ASKY, which have stopped flying to Liberia and Sierra . Leone. The current . Ebola outbreak is the first documented outbreak in West Africa, and  the largest ever recorded since the virus was first . detected in 1976, with more than 1,200 cases so far. It far exceeds the next largest outbreak, involving 425 cases. Around 60 per cent of cases so far have been fatal and more than 700 people have died since the start of February. Public Health England (PHE) advises that the risk to tourists, visitors or expatriate residents in affected areas is considered very low as long as they take the correct precautions. The highest risks of infection are associated with caring for infected patients, particularly in hospital settings, unprotected exposure to contaminated bodily fluids, and unsafe medical procedures, including exposure to contaminated medical devices, such as needles and syringes. It is recommended that travellers: . The first stage of the illness is characterised by fever, headaches, nausea, vomiting, a rash and diarrhea. The . second is haemorrhagic fever in which patients endure . difficulty breathing and swallowing and agonising bleeding inside their . body. Blood pours out of their ears and nose and turns their eyes . from white to red. Generally patients who . enter the second stage do not survive. There is no proven cure for the virus, . which kills an estimated 60 per cent to 80 per cent of the people it . infects, but American doctors in Africa say the mortality rate would be . much lower in a functioning health care system. They have also been using experimental treatments, including the transfusion of blood that includes antibodies.","Advice was a Level 3 travel warning, the strongest that can be issued .

"By . Catherine Eade . The design of airplane cabins has come a long way since the early days of commercial flying, but there's still plenty of room for improvement, as anyone who’s battled for elbow room or carry-on luggage space knows. So make way for a plane whose design draws more on the interiors of hotel rooms and luxury bathrooms than the trusty 747. The E2 aeroplane has tablet holders on headrests in place of the usual mini screens, touchless taps in the toilets, and a whole lot more personal space. Scroll down for video . Your very own cushion: The increased personal space for first class travellers is covered . Second class not too shabby either: Each passenger will have their own tablet embedded in the headrest in front . The design firm behind the rebranded interiors of Turkish Airlines and Lufthansa, Priestmangoode, has unveiled a new cabin design that'll hit the skies in 2018. E2, for the Brazilian aerospace conglomerate Embraer, attempts to fix many of the problems of existing cabins, from cramped seating and bathrooms to too-small luggage holds and excessive fuel consumption. The new design could be used by JetBlue, American Eagle, Delta, and US Airways, which are all clients of Embraer. The company says its aim is to increase space and efficiency, both for passengers’ comfort, and for ecological and economic reasons. Note the 'slimmer' seats and large screens for first class passengers . It's a toilet, but not as we know it: A 'touchless faucet' and check out the size of the jumbo loo roll . 'Your very own PSU': That's light and air control if you didn't know . Luxury seating: If you like the look of the new seats, wait until you see the bathroom . Same on the outside..different on the inside: The E2 planes will be launched in 2018 . The new planes will even have an 'acoustic curtain' around the toilet ... in case the sounds from within threaten to encroach on nearby passengers, and a better baby-changing space for parents. 'There's a constant drive in aviation to develop more eco-friendly designs, not just in terms of the materials used, but in improving fuel consumption, explains Paul Priestman, designer and co-founding director of the company. The company has accordingly reduced the overall weight of the plane by 'slimming down' seating, to create a plane that uses less fuel and frees up more space in the cabin for passengers. To reduce the impact of the proximity of fellow passengers - the design includes redesigned, individual Personal Energy Supply Units (PSUs) - the air and light control unit above the seats - to allow each passenger to control the light and air overhead without disturbing their neighbour. Sleek lines: Smart black uphostery with a touch of citrus...and comfy headrest . Not your average budget airline: The amount of space has been carefully measure to improve passengers' airborne experience . 'Say, for instance, the passenger next to you wanted to turn their reading light on or off, they would need to encroach on your personal space to do so. The redesign addresses that problem,' says Priestman. Competing with fellow passengers to cram your overstuffed carry-on into the overhead luggage hold could also become a thing of the past, with 40 per cent larger capacity compartments. The new design does away with much of the material that was unnecessary in current plane cabins, making for a lighter and roomier interior. As the company describes it, 'less passive aggression between you and all those annoying fellow passengers who keep getting in your space'. The E2 jets will start flying in 2018.","The 'E2' has been designed to improve passengers' airborne experiences .

"By . Sarah Gordon . We go on holiday to get away from it all, but three-quarters of us end up bumping into someone we know while on our travels. Proving that it is a small world after all, a third of Britons say they have encountered an old friend while on holiday and an unlucky quarter have run into a work colleague. A new study found that old neighbours and ex-lovers are among the people holidaymakers see while travelling abroad, with an unfortunate one in 20 bumping into a former boss. Fancy seeing you here: Three-quarters of Britons have bumped into someone they know on holiday . And we are most likely to encounter a familiar face when we're in a pub. A fifth of people have seen someone they know in a bar abroad, while a quarter have spotted a friend on the beach, according to the research by Lastminute.com. The most likely destinations where we will see an acquaintance are Spain and France, but you'll also struggle to get away from people you know in the USA, Greece and Portugal. Despite over half admitting to finding out that we are holidaying with someone we know, just under two in five (38 per cent) of us actually met up when away or stay in touch when we get back. Awkward moments: One in 20 Britons have bumped into a former boss on their travels . And almost a quarter (23 per cent) of people going out of their way to get away and avoid awkward chatter. Deliberately hiding, changing restaurants, relocating to another beach and getting an early flight home were cited as some of the extreme measure Britons go to, to avoid seeing someone they know. 1. Spain . 2. France . 3. USA . 4. Greece . 5. Portugal . 6. Turkey . 7. Italy . 8. Germany . 9. Egypt . 10. Australia . Psychologist Dr Ben Voyer said: 'We often believe that we have choices when it comes to holiday destinations, but the people we spend time around unconsciously shape our preferences – a phenomenon psychologists call social influence. 'We thus tend to form holiday preferences based on the people we like, the ones we are close to, and the ones we would like to resemble. From bankers in the City, to advertising managers in Shoreditch, every professional group tend to have its own stereotypical holiday destination, from the bling-bling holiday spot like St Tropez, to the more bohemian one. 'People love to self-stereotype, so it is not uncommon to find that they end up choosing a holiday destination that corresponds to the typical destination from their industry or work place.' Hotels, airports and sightseeing experiences were also shown to be common sites for an unexpected rendezvous. But the study revealed that it’s not just limited to the destinations close to home - incredibly, walking along the beach in Fiji and picking up baggage in Los Angeles airport were mentioned as locations where Brits had bumped into someone they knew. Bonding moment: The most likely place for spotting a familiar face is the pub... closely followed by the beach . More than one in ten Britons have realised they are on holiday with someone they know through the social media updates that have been shared from the sun lounger or same resort. Dr Ben Voyer added: 'Social media has made us more aware of the fact that our holiday destinations have much in common with the people we spend time with. This can also be explained by the fact that our social circles are not as big as we might think – it is estimated to be around 150 people. 'Given that we are, on average, 6 connections away from any complete stranger on earth, it makes sense that we would easily bump into people that we are directly connected to.'","Neighbours, work colleagues and even ex-lovers among those we bump into .

"By . Henry Jones . For most people, sharks are magnificent creatures – but definitely the sort of beasts you would want to avoid coming into close contact with in a dark corner of the sea.

A selfie with a difference: Andy pops up in shot for this close-up with a hammerhead shark . Coming right at ya! Andy's knowledge of shark behaviour enables him to capture images in safety . By photographing the animals in such a way, Andy, 47, aims to show that the sharks are far more interested in eating fish than they are people. In fact, in his 15 years of diving and interacting with these misunderstood animals, this daring British lensman’s only near-death experience occurred when his breathing equipment malfunctioned. ] . As this spectacular sequence of images . shows, Andy calls on his extensive knowledge of the creatures to take . the perfect picture of sharks feeding barely inches from his face. Deceptive: A trick of the camera suggests that this big whale shark is about to devour a nearby snorkeller . Necessary skills: Andy says that 'a deep understanding of shark behaviour is also absolutely critical' By using a mixture of fish and squid to attract the sharks, Andy waits until their mouths are fully extended before taking each shot – and has never once been harmed. Desperate to show sharks in a whole new light, Andy now runs an adventure travel company that brings people face-to-face with the majestic predators. ‘I've swum with countless sharks, and they generally show no aggression towards divers,’ he says. ‘When I do manage to entice sharks close to my camera, they sense the electrical fields surrounding my strobes and lights, but mostly they're just looking for the fish that they can smell.’ 38546 . 150977 . 49738 . 151975 . 91557 . 71797 . 33680 . 54760 . 30744 . 122114 . 16835 . Out of the deep: Andy says that sharks are misunderstood creatures - and that he has never been bitten . Black eyes, silver skin: The beauty of these astonishing creatures is wholly apparent in this photo . ‘It's important to respect these creatures. I don't wear chain mail, but I do wear equipment that isn't shiny or brightly coloured, because I don't want a shark to think it sees a fish and bite me in its confusion. ‘The only near-death experience I've had was when my breathing equipment malfunctioned 100ft underwater, and I almost didn't make it back to the surface. ‘Unfortunately, sharks are still portrayed as bloodthirsty monsters by Hollywood. ‘But, in reality, sharks are the ones that are under threat from us. Anyone for a swim? This unnerving picture shows a crowd of sharks waiting under a dive boat . ‘Their numbers have been reduced to a tiny fraction of what they once were. ‘We are in serious danger of losing some species if we continue to fish for them.’ There is, of course, considerable skill to what Andy does. Capturing a shark on camera at just the right moment is, he says, all about the speed of the cameraman. ‘It's very difficult to get a good mouth-gape shot,’ he says. ‘Good reflexes and an underwater camera that has a fast-focusing, wide angle lens are both important. A deep understanding of shark behaviour is also absolutely critical. Every shark is different. ‘Even among the same species certain sharks have different personalities. Some get far more excited than others, so it's very important to read the sharks and pay attention to how each one responds to me.’","Fearless lensman Andy Murch specialises in close-up shots of sea predators .

"By . Carol Driver . More than 10 per cent of Brits has had items stolen from their hand luggage while waiting for a flight at an airport. Turkey, Egypt, France, America and Greece emerged as the most common destinations outside the UK to become a victim of airport theft. Mobile phones, money and passports were the possessions most likely to be taken, followed by jewellery and iPads or tablets. Busy airport: Nearly half the victims (42 per cent) said they had been distracted at the time of the theft . Some 11 per cent of the 2,836 adults questioned confessed to having items stolen from them at an airport. With 88 per cent happening at an airport outside the UK. Of the remaining individuals, 64 per cent said a friend or family member who had fallen prey to pickpockets. Nearly half the victims (42 per cent) said they had been distracted at the time, while 36 per cent said they were asleep at the boarding gate or departure lounges. For 12 per cent the theft happened whilst they were going to the toilet or buying goods in airport shops. Six per cent of travellers said they were asleep at the boarding gate or departure lounges at time of theft . Fewer than half (47 per cent) reported the theft to airport staff, with just 18 per cent of these successfully managing to retrieve the stolen item or find out what happened to it. Those polled revealed the most likely items to be taken from hand luggage whilst at an airport were mobile phones (19 per cent), money (16 per cent), passports (11 per cent), jewellery (6 per cent), and iPads or tablets (4 per cent) The countries in which the most airport thefts happened according to the survey are: Turkey (19 per cent), Egypt (17 per cent), France (12 per cent), America (9 per cent), and Greece (6 per cent). Leon Edwards, Group Managing Director of Versapak, which carried out the survey, said: ‘When you are at an airport, there are certain circumstances that can have an adverse effect on how aware of personal belongings you are. ‘I have also noticed at airports that a lot of the time, passengers take somewhat of a lacklustre approach towards their personal security. ‘Much of the time, bags are kept on the airport floor and unfastened, meaning valuable goods are on show to everyone, including potential thieves.’","Mobile phones, money and passports among items most likely to be stolen .

"By . Mail Online Reporter . The boss of  Blue Sky Hostel in Glasgow, Todd Pedersen, who has sparked an online storm . A hostel owner has stumbled into controversy after being branding a customer as a ‘retard’ in an online spat. Todd Petersen fired the unpleasant insult at a guest who left a negative review of his property. Louise Taylor stayed at Blue Sky Hostel in Glasgow during a visit to see the ongoing Commonwealth Games. But after deciding that her accommodation was less than satisfactory, she vented her frustrations on the hostel’s Facebook page. ‘Worst hostel I have ever stayed in,’ she wrote. ‘Grotty, . uncomfortable, wires coming out of walls everywhere, mouldy bathrooms, . only 1 working shower in the building, aggressive, foul mouthed staff . & at 2am there were people having to change beds & rooms about . which woke everyone else up. ‘No . light switch in the room nevermind a plug socket! Bed was a foam . mattress which didn't even cover the springs. Place is a health hazard. AVOID.’ Her words earned the ire of Mr Pedersen. Now, . as the row has gone viral, the Canadian hotelier, 46, has defended his . abusive comment – and claimed that Louise, from Lancashire, did not . raise any concerns during her stay. ‘It was totally ridiculous,’ he said. ‘She didn't ask anything or make a peep while she was here and was asked when she left, and said everything was OK. ‘Four hours later I saw the review on the webpage and it was just ridiculous. Saying things that were totally wrong. ‘She . didn't say anything like that. We did have a screw up with people in . her room. She didn't know where stuff like the showers were and she . didn't ask. ‘After . the fourth or fifth person I just started taking the piss out of them. Just a big joke after that. People were calling me Hitler and all kinds . of things, and it just got blown up. ‘I don't remember half the stuff that went on there. What can you do? Everybody just started saying all kinds of crazy stuff. All of a sudden it's gone viral. ‘The part I stand by is when I said look you didn't ask anybody anything, all your assumptions were wrong. ‘Nobody has any face-to-face communications any more. They can type on Facebook and can't come down to reception and say they're unhappy. Angry exchange: The row has been sparked by a stay at the Blue Sky Hostel which left a guest unsatisfied . ‘All your complaints could have been rectified in two seconds if you'd asked. The rest of it was just a bunch of people blowing things out of proportion.’ In his initial online response, Pedersen claimed: ‘We are having a new fire alarm installed, sorry, we care about safety. ‘The . light switches are right beside the door, open your eyes. There are six . sockets in the room you were in, they are in the wall where they . normally are in most houses. ‘The . reason people were being moved is because you retards left your door . open and people came in your room that were not booked in your room. ‘This is why everyone must have a key and not put shoes in the doors when you go to the toilet! ‘Not once did you come ask where showers were, if you did you would have been told the locations. ‘There are showers on every floor. 'Obviously you have no communication skills other than typing in Facebook.’ Other . people were quick to join the debate between the pair after Todd . claimed the hostel was for those aged 18-35 and said he warned people . who wanted ‘five-star’ service that this isn't what they will find at . his establishment. One Facebook user, Grant Hodgson, wrote: ‘You're lucky you aren't 36, Lou. Otherwise you would've been too old to stay.’ Pedersen . replied saying: ‘That's why we have a age limit, seems after 35 people . bitch about everything, ohhh, i booked a 18 bed dorm and couldn’t . sleep...’ A . determined Louise told the owner: ‘I didn't want 5 star service; I . wanted a clean bed for the night, the ability to sleep and the ability . to have a shower in the morning without scalding myself/feeling sick . looking at all the mould.’ After . the exchange went viral, users of the social networking site moved to . TripAdvisor to post fictitious reviews of the hostel. Someone . even mocked up a picture of the hostel owner on a book cover titled: . ‘F**k You: Lessons in customer service and general satisfaction.’ The . hostel owner remained upbeat about the online conversation which has gone viral online. He said: ‘There's no such thing as bad publicity. Who knows what's going to happen? It doesn't really matter. ‘I've got thriving business and about 2,500 customers in a month and have about four complaints. 'If she would have just come and asked, everything would have been sorted out, but she didn't.’","Argument erupts after hostel owner flings insult at an unhappy customer .

"By . Chris Kitching . Scottish officials are pointing the finger at English tourists after heaps of rubbish were allowed to pile up near the busiest border crossing with Scotland. Grease-stained takeaway containers, empty plastic bottles and assorted litter covered the ground at the base of an overflowing bin on the A1 just north of Berwick-upon-Tweed, the northernmost town in England. Stunned motorists snapped photos as they drove past the unpleasant sight that formed just metres from a sign that proudly welcomes visitors to Scotland. This place is not a dump: Locals say the mess on the A1 is giving people the wrong impression of Scotland . Residents were so upset with the foul-smelling mess they complained to local and national officials and demanded it be cleared at once. Scottish Borders Council apologised to angry residents and blamed English tourists who are visiting Scotland for the Commonwealth Games and other big summer events. The eyesore is one of the first things motorists encounter as they enter Scotland at a border crossing used by about 23 million vehicles a year. Locals say the sight of the bin is an awful advertisement for Scotland as it gives visitors the wrong impression of their country. Scotland is seeing a spike in visitors - and roadside rubbish - thanks to a series of high-profile summer events . Joyce McLean, who resides about eight miles north of the border in Reston, is vowing to forward her photos to First Minister Alex Salmond. The 69-year-old retired office worker for Northumbria Police said: ‘The amount of litter is phenomenal. It's a real problem - but it's people in cars throwing it out. It's very, very difficult to catch them. ‘I have never seen a rural area so bad. It's really time it was highlighted.’ She said two of her dogs have been maimed by broken tins on two separate occasions. She added: ‘It sends out the wrong message during the Commonwealth Games.’ Clean up that mess: Residents of nearby towns complained to local and national officials about the eyesore . Locals also complained about waste that piled up at the lay-by just north of the A1 at Ayton. Eyemouth resident Karen Walker called it ‘absolutely disgusting’. With so many high-profile events taking place, Scotland is seeing an influx of visitors at the border crossing on the A1 and that means more rubbish is being dumped by motorists. Scottish Borders Council is promising to review its refuse collection service at the border. Scottish Conservative Borders MSP John Lamont said he hopes the issue will be resolved immediately. He said: ‘Nobody wants to see litter all over the place when they arrive into Scotland. It's the kind of image that gives Scotland a bad reputation.’","Motorists snapped photos of rubbish spewing from bin at border crossing .

"By . Adrian Durham . Follow @@talkSPORTDrive . Over the next couple of weeks, and especially when England play Costa Roca in Belo Horizonte on June 24, you will hear a lot about a game played in the same city which is seen as the biggest World Cup shock of all time – USA 1-0 England in 1950. In particular you will hear the name Joe Gaetjens. I spent a lot of time researching this particular game for my book ‘Is He All That?’ and concluded that while the FA let the national team down, it’s a result that should never have stood. The circumstances of the game render it meaningless in my view and in no way should the result be regarded as the biggest upset in football history. Disaster: England goalkeeper Bert Williams looks on helplessly as he is beaten by Joe Gaetjens . Horror: Sir Alf Ramsey (right) played as England suffered an embarrassing 1-0 defeat at the hands of the USA . Firstly let’s assess the England team at that time – they were brilliant. In 1948 they went to Italy and won 4-0 in Turin against the double world champions. It was so easy that Stanley Matthews stood in the corner with the ball at his feet and combed his hair with his hands as he waited for the well-beaten Italians to challenge him. But in Brazil two years later, the pomposity of the FA at that time was so out of control they decided to send Matthews – comfortably England’s best player – to an exhibition tour of north America rather than take him to the World Cup. So Matthews sailed to Canada for the first ‘showpiece’ game, then took the train to New York for the second match, but he was injured. The FA XI beat a USA national team 1-0, an ironic contrast to what would happen later in Belo Horizonte. He then flew to Brazil via Trinidad. Having missed England’s first ever World Cup match - they beat Chile 2-0 - Matthews then sat in the stands in Belo Horizonte to watch the USA defeat. The Grimsby fishmonger Arthur Drewry picked the team in his role as FA selector (he would later become a FIFA president). Seemingly the main thing the England manager Walter Winterbottom did at the World Cup was don an apron and teach the chefs at the Luxor Hotel in Rio how to fry eggs after they had served up a black and burnt mess on a plate to the players. But the FA’s buffoonery was not the reason this result was a joke. Three of the victorious players did not have USA citizenship, including the goalscorer Gaetjens. FIFA allowed them to play on the promise that they would all get citizenship after the tournament. However, the USA captain that day Ed McIlvenny failed to ever become a US citizen. To make it worse for England, he was Scottish. As a bizarre aside, Scotland qualified but refused to go to this World Cup because they had failed to win the Home Championship after a fortunate England win at Hampden Park. These ‘ringers’ were brought in when the Americans realised they had a team that was likely to be humiliated at the World Cup. In 1948, when England went to Italy and won 4-0, the USA had lost to the Italians 9-0. They had actually been semi-finalists in 1930 and wanted to protect that proud history - not be remembered for embarrassing results. So they hunted for good players whether they were American or not. Gaetjens was from Haiti. He was found washing pots and studying in Brooklyn, and he only met his World Cup team-mates two days before they travelled to the tournament. The goal itself was a joke: Walter Bahr hit an awful shot - some thought it was a cross – which was one of only two efforts they had in the 90 minutes, and according to most accounts of the game I’ve read, it hit the oblivious Gaetjens on the back of the head and went in. Alf Ramsey played in the game and said: ‘He (Gaetjens) ducked to avoid the ball.’ Three-and-a-half years after scoring that goal Gaetjens played in a World Cup qualifier for the country of his birth Haiti. So much for being an American citizen. Lofted up high: Gaetjens is carried off the pitch in celebration but wasn't even an American citizen . Sorry, you are? USA skipper Ed McIlvenny (right) was Scottish and exchanged pleasantries with Billy Wright . Battler: English midfielder Tom Finney (centre) goes up for a header between American defenders Charlie Colombo and Walter Bahr . Ball in hand: Williams and Ramsey tried to get England going but failed . in Belo Horizonte . Confidence: Ramsey and other members of the England team get fitted for their suits ahead of their flight to Rio . It was a crazy result, and it is wheeled out as some sort of symbol of English uselessness when there are far better examples of that from World Cup history; the whole 2010 campaign under Fabio Capello springs to mind. It was a lucky win for the USA - their goalkeeper Frank Borghi literally never kicked a ball in the game, because he was useless with his feet; England hit the bar at least five times. It was a watershed for the English FA’s superior attitude (this was the first World Cup they bothered to enter) and the USA team had a few ringers. Even though I believe the result shouldn’t have stood, and by fielding non-US citizens I believe the Americans cheated, I am glad that Gaetjens is seen as the hero. His life ended in tragedy. His family were members of the Haitian aristocracy, and when the dictator Papa Doc Duvalier tightened his grip on the country, his vicious army, the Tonton Macoutes, snatched Gaetjens as he started a day’s work at the dry-cleaning business he owned. He was taken to Fort Dimanche, the notorious prison where inmates were tortured - sometimes sexually - and murdered. It is widely believed that ‘men were sent there to die’. It was a torture and death chamber, where 40 men were crowded into rooms measuring just a few square feet. They ate gruel off the floor, and they drank only the water they were hosed down with. One American journalist said this: ‘Most men do not leave Fort Dimanche; if they are not beaten to death they die of tuberculosis, dysentery, or having the blood sucked from them by scores of vermin.’His relatives never heard from him again. It is believed he is one of the 30,000 or more executed by Papa Doc. So hail Gaetjens as a hero, but bear in mind the context and circumstances of that USA victory over England in Belo Horizonte in 1950.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A series of billboards showing Jesus covered in tattoos has upset many Christians living in the Texas city where the posters have been put up. The billboards, which show Jesus with the sins of those who have come to him tattooed across his body, have been condemned as blasphemous by some West Lubbock residents. However, the grassroots group behind the campaign say the posters were meant to spread a positive message and get people talking. Sins: A controversial Christian campaign has shocked residents in a Texas city . The billboards feature Jesus wearing a crown of thorns and with his arms outstretched. Across his bare chest and arms words such as 'outcast', 'addicted', 'jealous'  and 'hatred' have been tattooed on his skin. 'I don't like the picture. I think it's very derogatory,' one resident told ABC News. Another said: 'I'm thinking it's more blasphemous, negative.' The poster directs people to the website Jesustattoo.org, where a video shows people coming to Jesus to have their sins cleansed. During the six-minute video, a woman seen having her tattoo of 'self righteous' changed to 'humbled' and a boy on crutches having 'outcast' changed to 'accepted' are among those who visit the tattoo parlor. Transformed: One woman has her tattoo changed to 'humble' and a boy marked as 'outcast' is helped . Changed: A tattoo artist playing Jesus inks a more positive message on a sinner . Absorbed: The tattoo artist's back is revealed to show the negative messages appearing on his skin . The video then shows the negative tattoos appearing on the body of Jesus, whose skin had been unblemished at the start of the film. While some find the poster campaign in poor taste, the pastor of the city's Southcrest Baptist Church has praised its message. 'I thought that it was cleverly done because, basically, it's a visual of Jesus taking the sins . of people and covering them and taking them from an outcast or something . and giving them a new start, which is what the gospel is about,' David . Wilson said. 'This is perfect because it just draws people in here,' he added. The group behind the campaign, who have erected more than 50 billboards across Lubbock in the past nine days, say they are not trying sell anything. Ashleigh Sawyer, the group's spokesman, said: 'The message is a simple one, Jesus's love is transformative. He loves us unconditionally and no matter what you've been marked with, faith in Him and love for others will transform us.' Message: The group behind the campaign say they are trying to spread a message of hope . She told the Christian Post the group, which is not affiliated with any organization, accepted some may find the images of tattoos on Jesus to be in poor taste, but defended the reasons behind the campaign. 'We welcome the controversy because we understand that a dialogue on the issue is the best way to spread the message,' Ms Sawyer said. The group plans to extend its billboard campaign to other regions.","More than 50 of the adverts appear in Texas city .

"By . Sadie Whitelocks . A heartfelt open letter from a mother thanking a 'kind stranger' for entertaining her autistic daughter during a two-and-half-hour flight has been read more than 51,000 times with many deeming it a 'touching' and 'beautiful' story. Shanell Mouland, 36, from New Brunswick, Canada, uploaded a note to her blog Go Team Kate last Thursday detailing how the mystery passenger engaged her three-year-old Kate in conversation instead of ignoring her. 'Thank you for not making me repeat those awful apologetic sentences that I so often say in public,' she wrote. 'Thank you for entertaining Kate so much that she had her most successful plane ride, yet. And, thank you for putting your papers away and playing turtles with our girl.' Scroll down for video . Grateful: Shanell Mouland, 36, from New Brunswick, Canada, penned an open letter thanking a stranger for being kind to her autistic daughter Kate during a two-and-half-hour plane journey - she has since been reunited with the man . Not only did Mrs Mouland's letter attract thousands of hits but it also saw her reunited with the 'hero' in question. One of Eric Kunkel's relatives forwarded him the post and he was amazed when he realized he was the one being praised. 'I read it and then went to [the Mouland's] Facebook page and the rest is history,' the married businessman from New Jersey said. The Moulands and Kunkels have now become good friends. Mrs Mouland revealed in her letter how Mr Kunkel had allowed Kate to call him 'daddy' without issuing a correction. The mother-of-two continued: 'The moment you sat down, Kate started to rub your arm. Hero: Eric Kiunkel said he was shocked when he realized he was the 'stranger' being praised . 'Your jacket was soft and she liked the feel of it.  You smiled at her and she said:  ""Hi, Daddy, that's my mom.""  Then she had you.' 'You could have shifted uncomfortably in your seat. You could have ignored her.  You could have given me that 'smile' that I despise because it means; 'manage your child please.' 'You did none of that. You engaged Kate in conversation and you asked her questions about her turtles.' Mrs Mouland detailed in her letter, titled 'Dear 'Daddy' in Seat 16C Flight 1850 From Philly', how traveling with her autistic toddler can often be difficult. She was especially nervous this time around because she had been split up from her husband, who was sitting in another area of the plane with their other daughter. But thanks to Mr Kunkel's kindness, Kate stayed well-behaved for the duration of the flight from Philadelphia to Maine and only started getting agitated towards touch down. At the end of her letter, Mrs Mouland reassured her unknown companion: ‘[Kate] was fine the moment we stepped off the plane. Thank you for letting us go ahead of you. She was feeling overwhelmed and escaping the plane and a big, long hug was all she needed. 'So, thank you. Thank you for not making me repeat those awful apologetic sentences that I so often say in public. 'Thank you for entertaining Kate so much that she had her most successful plane ride, yet.' After reading the message, one commentator wrote: 'This is such a great story, it brought tears to my eyes. I have a daughter and know exactly what it is like to have to do the apologizing.' And another added: 'This was a very touching story and I am so glad that things turned out well. Sometimes we forget that there are still good people out there and are understanding.' From the heart: Mrs Mouland's open letter has since attracted more than 51,000 hits since it was posted on January 9 . Mrs Mouland said the experience taught her to never judge someone based on their appearance - which she did do with Mr Kunkel when she saw him on the plane. 'I assumed that a man in a business suit wouldn't be patient with Kate,' she told Yahoo, 'and I'm so fortunate to have been proved wrong.' Mrs Mouland and her family were returning home from a vacation at Disney World in Orlando and taking a connecting flight. 'I assumed that a man in a business suit . wouldn't be patient with Kate and I'm so fortunate to . have been proved wrong.' She decided to write an open thank you letter to the man she has now identified as Mr Kunkel after getting home and realizing what a gift she had received. Her daughter Kate was born eleven days late in May of 2010 and was a few weeks old when doctors diagnosed her with hypothyroidism - a condition affecting the thyroid gland. Mrs Mouland said she first started to realize something else was wrong with Kate when her speech and motor skills were slow to develop. In July 2012 she met with a pediatrician and speech pathologist who asked questions and made various observations. Recalling the meeting she writes on her blog: 'The assessment took about two hours. They asked if she pointed at things and looked for our reactions; she did not. Kate was diagnosed with autism in July 2012 after her mother noticed her speech and motor skills were not developing as they should have been . 'They asked if she had an interactive attention span and again she did not. They asked many more questions and I tried to craft my answers so that they could not nail down a diagnosis. '[My husband, Alex and I] still had hope, until the very last minute when the doctor walked into the room, sat down and said: ""Kate has autism spectrum disorder.""   have no idea what she said after that. 'I held it together a little bit until I walked in and saw my mom and my brother. Then I cried for a little while.' She says that she finds comfort in  blogging about her experience of bringing up an autistic child. 'The emails and comments we are receiving through this blog have been priceless to us. 'The sweet comments and the suggestions are helping us make connections that are going to change things for kids like Kate and their families.' However, she says her main aim with the blog is to encourage a better understanding of autism so there will be more Mr Kunkels in the world.","Shanell Mouland, 36, from New Brunswick, Canada, was shocked to find that her message was read more than 51,000 times .

On a power circuit such as Spa-Francorchamps, Mercedes' only potential challenge is likely to come from Williams, although Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa found themselves considerably off the pace. For Rosberg and Hamilton, with just 11 points splitting the duo ahead of the final eight races of the campaign, come the end of 90 minutes in sunny, but cool conditions - with temperatures hitting 15 degrees centigrade - they were separated by only 0.097secs.

McLaren's Jenson Button split the Ferraris, with the 34-year-old just over six tenths of a second off of Rosberg's pace, with team-mate Kevin Magnussen in seventh, 1.645secs down. Force India's Sergio Perez and Nico Hulkenberg also appear well placed as the duo were sixth and eighth quickest, 1.326secs and 1.360secs in arrears respectively. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo, the only driver to win a race other than Rosberg and Hamilton this season, was 1.395secs behind Rosberg.

Bottas then completed the top 10, but a staggering 1.595secs down, albeit with the suggestion there is so much more to come from his car, similarly with Massa who was down in 15th and 2.391secs back. Sauber reserve Giedo van der Garde, replacing Esteban Gutierrez, was 17th, six tenths of a second and two places down on team-mate Adrian Sutil. Alexander Rossi was 20th for Marussia, the American on Thursday seemingly poised to make his race debut this weekend due to Max Chilton being axed for 'contractual issues'.

"By . MailOnline Reporter . Police who patrol school grounds in the Los Angeles suburb of Compton are to be given semi-automatic rifles to help deal with firearms incidents. The move - revealed as children prepared to return after the summer holidays on Monday - came after officers said they needed to better equipped to deal with attackers who are increasingly well-armed. In several recent US school shootings, suspects have been armed with high-powered guns and protected by body armor, and officers also cited the prospect of a terrorist attack. Police who patrol school grounds in the Los Angeles suburb of Compton are to be given semi-automatic rifles to help deal with firearms incidents such as the massacre at Sandy Hook in 2012 (pictured) Officers in Compton will now be able to call upon an AR-15 semi-automatic assault rifle, which would allow them to penetrate a suspect's body armor and target them from further away than with handguns. But residents in Compton - which has long been associated with gang and gun culture - claimed the move was unnecessary, and added that police had never had to shoot anyone on a school campus before. The local school board, which has responsibility for 26,000 students in the south LA suburb, has allowed specially selected officers to carry the AR-15s in the back of their cars after undergoing training. William Wu, Compton police chief, told the school board in a meeting last month: 'This is our objective: save lives. Officers will be armed with AR-15 semi-automatic weapons similar to the one pictured . There have been at least 74 school shootings since the Sandy Hook massacre, in which 26 people died . 'Handguns you'd be lucky to hit accurately at 25 yards. With a rifle in the hands of a trained person, you can be go 50, 100 yards accurately.' Some students and parents, who have previously accused school police in Compton of racial profiling, expressed concern over the switch to more powerful weapons on school grounds. 'The school police has been very notorious in the community and in reality has never had to shoot anyone before,' said Francisco Orozco, a recent Dominguez High School graduate and founder of the Compton Democratic Club, told KPCC. 'So this escalation of weapons we feel is very unnecessary. 'The school police has not even earned the right to carry handguns.' According to Mr Wu, several other US school districts in California, Florida, Utah and Kansas already have police armed with semi-automatic weapons. He said: 'These rifles give us greater flexibility in dealing with a person with bad intent who comes onto any of our campuses.' Ladd Everitt, spokesman for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, said the development was 'deeply disturbing'. He told Fox News: 'There is no other free nation in the world that would even consider this.' According to The Washington Post, there have been at least 74 school shootings since the deadly Sandy Hook massacre of December 2012. Although Compton - which has a population of 100,000 - has a global reputation for violence, the murder rate has dropped dramatically in recent years. It is ranked as LA's 11th 'most deadly neighborhood'  over the past 12 months, according to the Los Angeles Times. It ranks high in both violent crime and property crime rates, with gunshots being the most common cause of death. The national debate over racial profiling by police has been reignited recently by the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. When violent riots erupted in the city, the local police departments responded with armored vehicles, SWAT units and military-grade armors in the following days.","Police 'not equipped' to deal with modern trend of heavily-armed attackers .

"By . Rebecca English . Given that the Duchess of Cambridge frequently raids her mother’s wardrobe, perhaps this is Carole Middleton’s way of getting her own back. The 57-year-old wore an unusual fur headband around her white safety helmet during a family holiday to the upmarket French ski resort of Meribel. While Kate, 30, and her husband were both sporting rather more mundane black protective headwear, Mrs Middleton’s choice of fluffy accessory made her stand out on the slopes. Turning heads: In her distinctive headband, Carole sits next to son-in-law Prince William on a ski lift in France . Freebie: Carole's helmet headband was originally destined for Kate's head when it was sent to the Middletons from British firm Fosi . Family affair: Carole Middleton, left, enjoys a quiet moment on the ski lift with the Prince William and her daughter Kate, centre, aswell as her brother James, right. Function over fashion: Kate opted to ski in a rather more mundane black helmet when she took to the slopes . But it seems the fake fur band was originally destined for Kate’s head – and was sent to her by British firm Fosi,  via her parents’ company, after her engagement to Prince William was announced in late 2010. It was a canny marketing ploy by the Plymouth-based skiwear accessories firm, whose motto is ‘drab to fab in seconds’, as anything Kate wears, from dresses to wellington boots, usually sells out instantly. It is not clear whether the Duchess, an accomplished skier, ever got to try out the gift, which sells for £29.99. But it certainly found favour with her mother – before finding its way into her suitcase for the recent holiday. Unusually for a family that prides  itself on its discretion, Mrs Middleton even sent a letter to Fosi’s founder,  Barbara Lees, to thank her for the present. Handwritten on headed paper sent from the family’s £1.5million home in Bucklebury, Berkshire, it warned Mrs Lees that ‘we’ – presumably meaning Carole and her husband Michael – ‘do not normally accept gifts’. But it went on to describe the ski helmet band as ‘lovely’ and wished Mrs Lees, who set up the company in 2010, success in her venture. It read: ‘Thank you very much for the helmet headband. Family fun: Pippa, left, appeared comfortable on the French slopes, while her sister Kate, right, has a reflective moment during the break . On the climb: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge climb to the top of a slope during their extended Easter ski break . In control: Pippa looked calm and composed as she showed her skills on the slopes . ‘We do not normally accept gifts  and would be grateful if you could not send anything else, but I think it’s a lovely product and wish you every success.’ While secretly delighted to have received the letter, Mrs Lees thought nothing more of it until she saw  photographs of Mrs Middleton wearing the ‘Lynx’ headband on a ski lift with the Duke of Cambridge in the  Trois Vallées. ‘I was astonished and couldn’t be happier,’ she told the Mail. Leading the way: Carole and Kate head down the slopes, while Prince William hangs back slightly uphilll . Laying low: Prince William crouches down while demonstrating some less conventional skiiing skills in Meribel . ‘We are a new business in a very competitive market so it was a massive boost to Fosi to see her in it. Carole Middleton is a very stylish woman and we think it looks great on her.’ The Middletons wrote a handwritten letter to Mrs Lees thanking her for the fur hat . Mrs Lees, who has skied since  she was a teenager, created  the product after being forced  to wear a helmet when she took  up snowboarding. ‘The main reason I didn’t wear one before was vanity, I suppose,’ she explained. ‘Unless . you really do look like Kate Middleton, then they really aren’t very . flattering. I had a lovely collection of fur hats that I used to wear . and so decided to create something based on them that made the helmet . look better. ‘The Fosi is . non-slip and can just be attached around the helmet. It cost me £40,000 . to set the  business up but we have been growing steadily. ‘That . said, to see Carole Middleton wearing it is such an unbelievable boost . and just goes to  show that nothing ventured,  nothing gained.’ Designed . to encourage more women to wear helmets, the  Lynx headband worn by Mrs . Middleton is one of the firm’s best-selling products. Should . she feel so inclined,  the royal in-law could also buy a matching . helmet tail, scarf, cuff, snood or even faux fur boot toppers to . complete the look. Unlike members of the royal family, the Middletons do . not have to declare any gifts given to them. Kate seemed happy to stick to her own headwear rather than borrow her mother's, while Pippa was also safety-conscious . Leg work: Kate maintains her balance as she ascends another slope in the Trois Vallees . Time with the in-laws: Prince William skis in . front of his mother-in-law Carole, while Kate looks on. Kate, right, . later took in the view as she climbed back to the top of the slope . And their daughter only has to record on the official Royal Gift Register details of items received during the course of her public duties since marrying Prince William last year. Mr and Mrs Middleton are entrepreneurs themselves and run a hugely successful internet-based firm, Party Pieces, which sells children’s party goods. The couple have been repeatedly accused of cashing in on their daughter’s association with  the royal family, although sources close to them insist they have  done their best to manage their long-standing business without causing embarrassment to the Duke and Duchess.",Duchess of Cambridge's parents joined Royal couple at exclusive French resort of Meribel .

Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene was carried off the pitch in Colombo on the shoulders of his team-mates as his final Test ended in victory over Pakistan. Rangana Herath took five for 57 in the second innings - and 14 wickets in the match - to propel Sri Lanka to a 105-run victory on the final morning at the Sinhalese Sports Club and send Jayawardene into Test retirement with a win.

Head and shoulders above: Jayawardene scored 34 Test centuries for Sri Lanka and averaged almost 50 . All smiles: Jayawardene is chaired off and holds a stump after Sri Lanka's win over Pakistan . The 54 he scored in his last innings was his 50th half century in the ultimate form of the game and he also took three slip catches. 'The decision to retire was something I have been thinking for some time and came to a point I felt that for me the right time was right,' said Jayawardene, who will play at next year's 50-over World Cup . 'It was just a gut feeling, but have I always gone with my gut feelings. 'Given the fact that we don't have Test cricket for another 12 months it's time for a new generation to take over. I will try to help that rebuilding process.' Jayawardene revealed he will also try to make room in his trophy cabinet for his Test cap which he has worn for 15 of his 17 years.

Sarfraz Ahmed followed up his century in the first innings with 55 in the second before he was caught by Kumar Sangakkara in the deep off seam bowler Chanaka Welegedara. Riaz's dismissal sealed victory for Sri Lanka, with Junaid Khan unable to bat after being hit on the head by a Dhammika Prasad bouncer in the first innings.

"By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . A teen who survived two deadly plane crashes - one that killed his mother and siblings and another that killed his dad and stepmom - has made his debut for the University of Michigan basketball team. Three years after he was left fighting for his life in a coma following the second crash, Austin Hatch played for the Wolverines during their first exhibition game in their pre-season tour in Italy. Hatch, who had to learn how to walk again following the second tragedy in June 2011, didn't score during his three minutes on the court on Sunday, but he reveled in his time playing for the team. 'As you can imagine it has been a heck of a journey to get here,' he told Michigan Athletics after the game. On court: Austin Hatch (center) runs on the court during his first game with the University of Michigan during a pre-season game in Italy on Sunday. It comes three years after he survived a second plane crash . Excitement: Hatch, pictured in his Michigan uniform, said it was 'unreal' to be playing with the team . 'Playing basketball at the University of Michigan has been my goal since I was a little kid. It was unreal to be here and to have actually played a game. I really feel like I have that game under my belt now and I really feel like a Michigan basketball player.' His astonishing feat comes after a decade of tragedy for the young player. Austin was just eight when he survived the first plane crash in 2003 when his father flung him out of the burning plane. But while he and his father survived, his 38-year-old mother Julie, 11-year-old sister Lindsay and five-year-old brother Ian all died in the crash. Then on June 24, 2011, Hatch's father was flying him, his stepmother and their labradoodle Brady between the family's home in Indiana and a Michigan summer house when they smashed into a garage of the Charlevoix, Michigan airport - and only Austin and Brady made it out alive. Tragic: In a place crash in 2003, (from left to right) Hatch's 38-year-old mother Julie, 11-year-old sister Lindsay and five-year-old brother Ian, all perished. He survived when his father threw him out of the plane . Second tragedy: But then in 2011, his father (pictured) was piloting a plane carrying Hatch, his stepmother and their dog, when the aircraft crashed into a garage - killing the couple and only saving Hatch and his dog . Crash: Just 10 days before the 2011 crash (pictured), Hatch had agreed to play for Michigan after graduation - but he was left with swelling on the brain, a punctured lung abd broken ribs and put in a coma . Pilot error was named as the cause of the crash. Just 10 days before the crash, Hatch - then the 6ft 6"" standout star of Canterbury High School’s team in Indiana - had agreed to play for the University of Michigan upon his graduation. Instead, he was left in a medically-induced coma with a brain trauma and other injuries, including a punctured lung, fractured ribs and a broken collarbone. He needed physical therapy to help him learn how to walk again and it is uncertain whether he will fully regain the coordination that earned him scholarship offers to play basketball. On losing his family for the second time, Hatch went to live with an uncle in California after deciding to leave his home town of Fort Wayne, Indiana as part of his recovery. As he fought to get stronger, Hatch kept his focus on his dream of playing basketball. 'Basketball has always given me something to shoot for,’ he said during an interview last November. Support: After the crash, Hatch went to live with his uncle (left) in California. They are pictured with Loyola High School coach, Jamal Adams, in November after Hatch announced he would play for Michigan this year . On Sunday, his dream became a reality, as his grandfather Jim cheered him along from the stands. 'It was a special moment,' Michigan coach John Beilein said. 'Austin even led us in the fight song after the game was over. It's something he has worked very hard for.' Hatch, who played the final three miutes of the second half of Michigan's 99-60 victory over the Perugia Select Team, said it was 'unreal' leading his team in the fight song after the game. 'I always thought to myself, ""I hope someday I am in position to be able to do that"",' he said. 'Just like everything else that happened today, it was just unreal to be able to do that.'","Austin Hatch's mother, 11-year-old sister and five-year-old brother perished in a plane crash that he and his father survived in 2003 .

"By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . A 13-year-old football player is in critical condition after a lightning bolt struck the field during practice. Hunter Keffer was walking on the field outside Picacho Middle School in Las Cruces, New Mexico when the bolt struck a tree at 5pm on Tuesday and hurtled towards him and team members. Keffer dropped to the ground and was not breathing when a parent ran over and gave him CPR, witnesses said. The boy was then rushed to MountainView Regional Medical Center. He was later transferred to the pediatric burn unit at University Medical Center of El Paso, where he was 'in stable condition and breathing on his own', his mother, a language teacher at the school, wrote online, the Las Cruces Sun-News reported. Injured: Hunter Keffer, pictured with his mother Mitzi, is being treated at a burns unit after lightning struck a tree on his school's football field on Tuesday and spread across the ground to reach him . The teen suffered the most serious injuries, but two other boys and a coach also suffered minor injuries and were taken to hospital as a precaution. The group had been leaving practice and heading for shelter because of sudden heavy rain when the field was struck without warning on Tuesday afternoon. 'I had seen the flash,' eighth grade football player Emiliano Frano told KVIA. 'It was gross - I never smelled anything like that.' He said people started falling after the strike spread out across the ground. Terrifying: A boy - not Keffer - waits in an ambulance to receive medical treatment following the strike . Distraught: Friends and family become emotional at the scene following the freak accident on Tuesday . 'There were people panicking, crying, you . know, people not knowing who got hit,' Franco said. 'I've never seen . anything like that.' The group then noticed that Keffer was . on the ground not breathing and completely stiff, witnesses told KVIA. A . parent rushed to give him CPR. 'The . CPR that he received on the field was what kept him long enough for the . paramedics to resuscitate him and stabilize him,' Picacho Middle . language arts teacher Dawson Yarbrough. Music teacher Emmanuel Hernandez added that if it hadn't been for the quick-thinking parent, 'it would be a different story'. Hospitalized: Hunter was not breathing when parents and staff ran over to him, and one parent carried out CPR on him. He is now breathing on his own and listed in stable condition . Scene: The lightning hit tall trees at the back of the football field and then traveled along the ground . Jo Galván, Las Cruces Public Schools spokeswoman, said the coaches had not seen any lightning or rain at the start of practice. Counselors and psychologists will be at the school on Wednesday to speak with any Picacho Middle School students or adults who want to speak about the incident.

"By . Snejana Farberov for Mail online . Do no harm: Dr Richard Lenhart, 53, is facing a slew of sexual assault charges for allegedly abusing one patient for 17 years and another for seven under the guise of psychological treatment . A former Pennsylvania psychologist has been arrested on sexual assault charges for allegedly practicing a special brand of ‘touching therapy’ on two female patients with a history of sex abuse. Dr. Richard Lenhart, 53, of State College, has been accused of sexually assaulting two women, who came to him seeking help, under the guise of treatment and then billing insurers as if he had provided legitimate services, prosecutors said. ‘The charges state Lenhart prescribed “touching therapy” for the women, which included touching and holding the patients. The therapy allegedly included stroking, sexual contact and rubbing of genitals,’ state Attorney General Kathleen Kane said in a press release. From 2008 to 2011, Lenhart submitted nearly 700 insurance claims seeking a total of more than $71,500 in reimbursement, falsely indicating he was rendering proper treatment, the attorney general’s office said. Lenhart, who is married and has a 19-year-old daughter, is charged with involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, aggravated indecent assault, sexual assault and criminal use of a communication facility. He is also charged with three counts of indecent assault and two counts of both insurance fraud and theft by deception. He is being held on $250,000 bail. Lenhart ran a private practice out of an office on South Pugh Street in State College until his license was revoked in March 2013. According to investigators, the 53-year-old doctor abused one of his patients, a woman named in the complaint as N.M., over the course of 17 years, between 1994 and 2011. The second victim, identified by her initials A.M., was allegedly subjected to abuse from 2003 to 2010. Scroll down for video . Private practice: Investigators say Lenhart touched his patients on their privates, got naked with them and watched pornography in his office in State College, Pennsylvania, where his wife worked as a secretary . The allegations against the veteran psychologist came to light three years ago when one of the patients complained about Lenhart's brand of therapy to the state Board of Psychology. In November 2012, the board temporarily suspended Lenhart's license pending an investigation, which ultimately resulted in the revocation of his license. A petition asking for Lenhart's suspension filed by the state Bureau of Professional and Occupational Affairs in 2012 detailed the allegations against the therapist. According to the document, the woman identified as N.M. came to him in 1994 suffering from issues linked to severe childhood sex abuse. The complaint obtained by CaseWatch.org stated that over the course of their 17-year relationship, the therapist 'groomed' the woman for sexual activity by holding her and rubbing her breasts and private parts. Lenhart's ‘touching therapy' practiced on the patient eventually came to include masturbation sessions and oral sex in his office – just steps away from his wife employed as his secretary, according to We Are Central PA. Lenhart 'informed N.M. that having a good sexual experience with him was probably the only bridge remaining for N.M. to heal from the trauma of severe childhood sexual abuse,' the document stated. Disgrace: The therapist lost his license in 2013 after one of the victims complained about his treatment . When the second victim, A.M., came to the psychologist in 2003 seeking help for anxiety, mood disturbance and a history of sex abuse, Lenhart allegedly developed an inappropriate relationship with the patient, which included watching pornography with her, ‘friending’ the woman on Facebook and sending her sexually explicit text messages. The petition asking to suspend Lenhart's license laid out how the middle-aged married father allegedly told the woman that he was aroused by her, touched the woman’s bare stomach, and let her straddle him. During their so-called therapy sessions, according to the complaint, the doctor and patient rubbed lotion on each other and lay down on the floor together. The 53-year-old doctor also allegedly wrote love notes to the woman, kept naked pictures of her and gifted the patient one of his shirts to she would think of him when they were apart.","Dr Richard Lenhart, 53, charged with sexual assault for allegedly abusing one patient for 17 years and another for seven .

"By . Snejana Farberov for Mail online . and Louise Boyle . Punished: Andrea Chisholm, 54, was sentenced to one year in prison for aiding and abetting wrongfully obtained public assistance . A Minnesota woman who once claimed to be Scottish nobility has pleaded guilty to illegally collecting welfare payments while living in a mansion. Andrea Chisholm, 54, accepted responsibility for aiding and abetting wrongfully obtaining public assistance. She admitted in court Tuesday she signed welfare applications that were inaccurate and resulted in her collecting more than $60,000, but told the judge they were filled out by her husband, 62-year-old Colin Chisholm III. Her plea agreement calls for one year and one day in prison, with credit for 142 days already served. ‘It’s appropriate that Andrea Chisholm spend time behind bars for cheating the public of welfare dollars,’ County Attorney Mike Freeman said. ‘Her husband’s case remains open, as it appears he was a bigger player in defrauding the public as we heard in Andrea’s testimony today.’ The presiding judge also ordered the defendant and her husband, who at one time called themselves Lord and Lady Chisholm, to pay restitution, Minnesota Star Tribune reported. The self-proclaimed aristocrats allegedly collected more than $167,000 in fraudulent medical and food-stamp claims in Florida and Minnesota while living in a $1.6million lakefront mansion in the Minneapolis suburb of Deephaven. They also owned a $1.2million yacht in Florida and had millions of dollars in their bank accounts, according to prosecutors. Large-scale fraud: The so-called 'Lady Chisholm' and her husband, Colin Chisholm III (right), 62, are accused of collecting more than $167,000 in fraudulent medical and food-stamp claims for seven years . Payback: The defendant (right) and her husband (left), who is headed for trial, will be forced to pay restitution . Dynasty: According to their company website, the couple trace their roots to Clan Chisholm in Struy, Scotland . There is no word yet if Andrea Chisholm will testify against her husband, who has a pretrial hearing set for September 10. Prosecutors claimed the Chisholms ran a seven-year scam while owning a six-bedroom palatial home on the shore of Lake Minnetonka, a beach property in Florida, a $30,000 Lexus and $3million in undeclared funds. The family’s web of lies began unraveling, according to officials, as investigators tightened the net around them, forcing the couple to flee to the Bahamas along with their seven-year-old son and their dog. According to the criminal complaint filed in February, the Chisholms applied for more than a dozen forms of medical assistance, welfare payments and food stamps, first in Minnesota and then in Florida. Living the dream: The couple moved into this sprawling lakefront property on Lake Minnetonka in 2008 . Lap of luxury: The seemingly destitute couple not only owned a $1.2million yacht but also a $30,000 Lexus . Lady Chisholm had her prenatal care for the couple's son in 2006 paid for by the state while claiming to be destitute. Colin Chisholm did not declare that he ran a broadcasting business, while Lady Chisholm kept mum about being the owner of a dog kennel which breeds elite Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. According to the website for their company Strathglass Kennel, the couple trace their roots to the Clan Chisholm from the small village of Struy in the Scottish Highlands. Mr Chisholm is listed as the president and CEO of TCN Network, a satellite TV company serving the Caribbean. More than $1million flowed through accounts he controlled as part of that company, a criminal complaint stated. The couple were living with Lady Chisholm's mother in Minneapolis when they first applied for welfare in 2005. However, for the next two years, they resided on their Florida yacht, and later at a beach property in the state, none of which was ever declared, investigators claim. In April 2007, the Chisholms came back to Minnesota and filled out forms for more benefits. Side business: 'Lady Chisholm,' pictured with her husband and son, kept mum about being the owner of a dog kennel that breeds Cavalier King Charles Spaniels . In March 2008, they moved into a luxury home in Deephaven with Andrea’s grandparents Eloise and Francis Heidecker. Francis died in February 2009 at age 94 and by September of that year, the Chisholms were evicted from the home. They immediately moved to another Deephaven home on Lake Minnetonka with stunning waterfront views. The home, built in 1909, has six bedrooms, five bathrooms and stretch to 5,800 sq ft set on 1.6 acres, according to property records. None of these details were declared on welfare forms - nor the fact Andrea Chisholm had power of attorney and controlled the finances of her elderly grandmother.","Andrea Chisholm, 54, was sentenced to one year and one day in prison after pleading guilty to aiding and abetting wrongfully obtained public assistance .

"By . Snejana Farberov for Mail online . Disturbing behavior: Chad Monroe, 34, was charged with stalking and unlawful posting of a message online after his ex-girlfriend complained to police that the man has vowed to make her life a living hell by posting nude photos of her on Facebook . A Michigan man was charged with stalking after police said he posted nude photos of his former girlfriend on Facebook with the intent of driving the woman to suicide. Chad Monroe, 34, of Bay City, was arraigned last week on counts of misdemeanor stalking and felony unlawful posting of a message online. When interviewed by police, the man allegedly informed them that his lawyer had told him that he had the right to disseminate naked photos of his former girlfriend online. The suspect was ordered held on $35,000 and barred from having any contact with his ex-girlfriend. According to arrest documents obtained by The Bay City Times, the unnamed woman went to the local police department July 31 to complain about her ex-boyfriend, telling officers that Chad Monroe has been harassing her over the phone - even though she had his number blocked - and sending her messages on Facebook. The former girlfriend reportedly said that Monroe vowed to make her life a living hell until she killed herself. The 34-year-old Bay City man allegedly posted the woman's nude pictures on Facebook and labelled her a 'whore.' According to court documents, one of the images that was uploaded onto the social media portal was a 'Wanted Dead or Alive' poster featuring the victim. Although the social media site deleted the lewd images, some users had saved them, according to the victim. The woman's mother told police that she too had received nude photos of her daughter from Monroe, who promised to destroy the woman and drive her to suicide. Cyber-bullying: The victim told police Monroe has been posting lewd images of her on Facebook with the intent of driving her to kill herself . Mr Monroe allegedly threatened to continue spreading the X-rated photos of his former paramour online until she returns some of his possessions. A week before she went to police for help, the ex-girlfriend had filed a personal protection order against Chad Monroe, which the man dismissed as a mere 'piece of paper.' When police contacted Monroe and asked him to come down to the station for questioning, the 34-year-old refused, saying that it was his ex-girlfriend who has been harassing him over the phone. Monroe reportedly sounded a defiant note, telling officers on the call that there was nothing they could do to him because the personal protection order has not been served to him. ‘I talked with my lawyer and he said I can put naked pictures of (her) on the Internet and I am going to keep doing it until she gives me my (expletive) back,’ he said, according to court records. ‘There's nothing you can do about it. I am staying up in Pinconning with my crazy aunt and she will shoot anyone who comes onto her property.’ But despite Monroe's self-assurance, on August 12, a warrant was issued for his arrest and the following day the 34-year-old was arraigned on two criminal counts. He is due back in court next Tuesday.","Chad Monroe, 34, of Michigan, charged with stalking and illegally posting messages online .

"By . Snejana Farberov for Mail online . Charlotte Ponce has been dreaming of putting on a pair of earrings for most of her young life - and now she can finally fulfill her wish. The 12-year-old Michigan girl, whose face was mauled by a pet raccoon when she was a baby, is celebrating the completion of two years' worth of reconstructive surgical procedures. Since August 2012, she has had her upper lip repaired, her nose rebuilt and been given a new right ear. She underwent skin graft surgery last week on the arm where her ear was harvested. Scroll down for videos . Dream come true: Charlotte Ponce, 12, can now finally wear earrings following a reconstructive surgery to rebuild her right ear (right) mauled by a raccoon more than a decade ago . Work in progress: Charlotte will require a few follow-up operations to give her ear (pictured) more definition . Treasure chest: People from around the country have been sending the 12-year-old earrings for her to wear after her final major surgery . 'I can finally wear earrings,' Charlotte said from her hospital bed in suburban Detroit. On Monday, Charlotte, her adoptive parents and the surgeon looked back on her journey. 'I kept my word. I told her we'd give her nose back, lip back and ear back, and so we did,' Dr. Kongkrit Chaiyasate, Charlotte's surgeon, told WXYZ-TV. On April 15, surgeons at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan spent seven hours embedding rib cartilage, shaped into an ear lobe, into Charlotte's arm where it grew for months.Before the complex procedure, which has only been performed twice before, Dr Chiayasate said he practiced on a potato. He told WBIV: 'As plastic surgeons we need to think outside the box a little bit - what can we do to make a life long reconstruction for her. 'I've been practicing carving potato last weekend using this as a template. It's not easy.' Charlotte has undergone at least 10 operations since 2012 to restore her face. She previously had a prosthetic ear fitted but it was not an ideal solution and soon became infected and uncomfortable. The girl was just an infant in 2002 when the family's pet raccoon climbed into her crib while her biological 18-year-old mother and 23-year-old father left her home alone with the animal in the western Michigan community of Ravenna. Childhood tragedy: Charlotte pictured as an infant before the raccoon mauling, left, and as a toddler (right) after the attack . New family: Charlotte has been living (from left) with her great-uncle Tim, great-aunt Sharon and brother Marshall, ever since her parents lost custody of her . Long time coming: Charlotte lived for a decade without a reconstructed nose, lips and right ear . High hopes: Charlotte is excited to go back to swimming, playing soccer and gymnastics . The raccoon was thought to have escaped from its cage after a door was left open when food had been dropped in, and no one was there to save the baby when she was attacked. Charlotte's parents were charged with owning a dangerous animal that caused serious injury and were placed on probation. In 2005, the state terminated Charlotte's biological parents' parental rights. After that, Charlotte and her older brother Marshall were adopted by Sharon and Tim Ponce, their great-aunt and great-uncle. The Ponces believe the raccoon, which later was put down, was after Charlotte's bottle. Charlotte will require a few follow-up operations to give her ear more definition. But now that the big reconstructive surgeries are behind her, she is ready to get back to playing soccer, swimming and doing gymnastics — and this worries Tim Ponce. 'Dad's afraid I'm going to break my neck one of these days while doing gymnastics,' Charlotte said. As for adorning her brand-new ear, Chaiyasate supplied his patient with a short-term fix. During last week's procedure, the doctor surprised Charlotte by piercing her new ear and fashioning a makeshift earring from IV tubing. Perfectionist: Charlotte with her adopted mother Sharon and Dr Kongkrit Chaiyasate after he built her a new nose in a 2012 operation . Revolutionary: The rib cartilage was molded into the shape of an ear and inserted into Charlotte's arm during the April 15 surgery . What a change: Before the surgery, the little girl only had a hole where her right ear was supposed to be . Almost there: Beaumont Health Systems posted this photo on Twitter last month with the caption, 'Charlotte is doing well as Dr. Chaiyasate transfers the molded ear from her arm to her head' In surgery: This image was taken during the groundbreaking transplant operation on Charlotte . But the 12-year-old girl won't have to wear the plastic tube for long: well-wishers from across the country have overwhelmed the Ponce family with dozens of earrings for the girl to wear, as well as hundreds of 'get well' cards. 'I have enough to last, like, 20 years,' the budding fashionista boasted to Fox 17 about her growing collection of accessories. Beyond the trinkets, Charlotte said she has a bucket list that includes a few serious goals, chief among them 'get married, then have an only child.'","Doctors built a new ear for Charlotte Ponce, 12, out of cartilage from her rib that was embedded in her forearm for several weeks .

"By . Snejana Farberov for Mail online . The Tall Ships Festival kicked off in the Port of Los Angeles Wednesday with the arrival of an unusual guest - the world's largest rubber duck. The canary-yellow 61-foot-tall bathtub toy sailed into port crowded with ships and filled with admiring crowds eager to catch a glimpse of the iconic artwork. It will remain in the harbor through Sunday. Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman debuted the photogenic duck in 2007, and versions of it have been seen around the world in places including China, Hong Kong, Belgium, Japan and New Zealand. Scroll down for video . Hard to miss: Dana Middle School students and teachers watch as a giant inflatable rubber duck is towed into the Port of Los Angeles Wednesday . Larger than life: The world-famous sculpture sailed into the port for the first time to kick off the Tall Ships Festival LA and will remain in the harbor through Sunday . Ready for his closeup: People react to the closeness as the six-story tall Rubber Duck by Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman . Top billing: People crowd a pier to watch as the 61-foot-tall duck leads a procession of Tall Ships . A Tall Ships Festival spokesman said the duck is just one of the features of the weeklong event that comes to L.A. every three years. On Wednesday morning, early risers rushed to Los Angeles’ San Pedro harbor just after dawn to witness the arrival of the 11-ton vinyl mallard, which sailed under the Vincent Thomas Bridge. Hofman's larger-than-life piece of flotsam was greeted by a gaggle of excited onlookers armed with cameras trained on the inanimate celebrity. Dwarfed by the duck: Anthony DeTucci, manager of vessel operation for the Port of Los Angels, left, and deckhand Rodolfo Gonzalez guide the mallard into the Downtown Harbor at the Port of Los Angeles . Some guests even turned up at the event dressed in yellow and red - Rubber Duck's signature colors - to celebrate the festival’s guest of honor. The giant floating sculpture was later towed to the Angels Gate Lighthouse to head a ship parade featuring more than a dozen vessels. Some of the Tall Ships fired cannons as they made their way into the Main Channel following in the duck's wake. More than 250,000 people are expected to take part in the maritime festivities headlined by the iconic duck. ‘This is 61 feet, 11 tons, about 85 feet wide and about 110 feet long [duck],’ festival spokesman Craig Samborski told ABC7. ‘I was shocked when I saw the size of it right in front of me.’ Organizers say Rubber Duck will be tied to a massive barge to keep it from floating away and will be lit up until 11pm each night through Sunday. According to a poster board placed in the harbor telling the story of Hofman’s super-sized creation, the duck was inspired by a 1992 accident in which a shipment of bathtub toys fell overboard on its way from Hong Kong to Washington, reported The Daily Breeze. Over the next 20 years, the rubber duckies and frogs from the doomed shipping crate washed ashore in Hawaii, South America, Alaska, and some even landed on icebergs in the Arctic. The humble toys, dubbed by flotsam and jetsam collectors 'Friendly Floatees,' helped shed light on our understanding of sea currents and the North Pacific Gyre – a mammoth patch of floating garbage in the middle of the ocean.

As for Florentijn Hofman, the artist behind the famed duck is convinced that his vinyl creation can play an important role in the world. 'The friendly, floating rubber duck has healing properties: it can relieve tensions as well as define them. The rubber duck is soft, friendly and suitable for all ages!' he previously stated.","Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman's massive mallard sculpture debuted in 2007 .

"By . Snejana Farberov for Mail online . and Associated Press . Russia's food safety watchdog will conduct checks on McDonald's restaurants in the Urals region in response to complaints, a day after four branches of the chain were shuttered in Moscow. Natalya Lukyantseva, an official in the Sverdlovsk regional office of the agency, told RIA Novosti and Interfax that unplanned checks were being carried out in a number of restaurants after residents voiced safety concerns. The inspections come one day after the agency, known in Russia as Rospotrebnadzor, ordered four Moscow-based restaurants to suspend operations, citing 'numerous' sanitary law violations. Scroll down for video . Shuttered: In this photo taken on Wednesday, August 20, 2014, one of closed Moscow's McDonald's outlets in downtown Moscow w . Lights out: A man looks through the glass door at the entrance of a closed branch of McDonald's in Moscow . Allegations: Russian officials are alleging that the US fast food chain had violated sanitary rules . One of those restaurants, on Moscow's central Pushkin Square, was the first to open in the Soviet Union in 1990, drawing crowds of thousands that circled around the block. The restaurant became a symbol of domestic reform and openness with the West, and today it is one of the company's most visited venues in Russia. The shutdown comes in the wake of rising tensions between Russia and the West. After the U.S. and the European Union slapped sanctions on a range of Russian banks and crucial industries last month in reaction to Vladimir Putin's annexation of Crimea, Russia responded with a wide-ranging ban on food products imported from those regions. McDonald's could not be immediately reached for comment about the checks in the Sverdlovsk region, but a statement posted on the Russian version of its website Wednesday said the company was doing 'all it can for a speedy opening' of the four Moscow restaurants. On Wednesday evening, the lights were off inside the popular Pushkin Square McDonald’s restaurant - which is usually crammed with diners - and a sign on the door said it was shut ‘for technical reasons.’ It was hugely popular with Russians; long lines formed outside and some people even had their wedding receptions there. Famed eatery: People walk past the oldest Moscow's McDonald's outlet in downtown Moscow, which was opened on Jan. 31, 1990, and is closed on Thursday . Novelty: In this file photo taken in 1991, Russians wait in line outside a McDonald's fast food restaurant in Moscow . Another of the restaurants closed on the orders of the food safety watchdog is on Moscow's Manezh square, under the walls of the Kremlin where President Putin has his offices. The state food safety watchdog said in a statement inspectors had found numerous sanitary violations. A source at the watchdog said it had sealed off parts of the restaurant premises. Some Russian consumers, however, are not lovin' their government’s crackdown against McDonald's. Dmitry Boiko, 46, who has been a loyal patron of the fast-food chain since the 1990s, was outraged to see the historic Pushkin Square location closed down when he went to get a Filet-O-Fish on his lunch break Wednesday. 'Personally I'm against them closing McDonald's,’ Boiko told Radio Free Europe Liberty Radio. ‘This was the first McDonald's. You could put a memorial to it here!’ Another loyal customer, a 62-year-old Muscovite named Nikolai, told the radio station that the fast food joint is one of the only places offering cheap eats in Moscow's central square lined with tony restaurants and boutiques. It became clear last month that McDonald's was under heightened scrutiny from the Russian state, when Rospotrebnazor said it had identified violations in product quality that raised questions about the safety of food across the chain. The agency filed a lawsuit against McDonald's, accusing the Novgorod branch of understating the caloric value of burgers and milkshakes by 50 per cent and serving food contaminated with e. coli bacteria. Foreign food producers who have fallen foul of the watchdog in the past have accused it of acting in the political interests of the Kremlin, an allegation it denies. The watchdog banned Georgian wine as Tbilisi strengthened ties with Washington and spirits from Moldova after the former Soviet republic boosted its drive to partner with the European Union. Earlier this month Russia banned all meat, fish, dairy, fruit and vegetable imports from the United States, the European Union, Norway, Canada, and Australia for one year in retaliation for the sanctions imposed by these countries over Ukraine. Defiant: Despite the closures, McDonald's plans to open new branches in Siberia by year's end . However, some of these restrictions were eased Wednesday to allow the import of some items that are useful to its own food and agriculture industries, such as vegetables for planting and hatchlings of salmon and trout. McDonald's operates 438 restaurants in Russia and sees the country as one of its top seven major markets outside the United States and Canada, according to its 2013 annual report. On Thursday, Russia's wire service ITAR-TASS reported that despite the branch closures this week, McDonald's will go forward with its expansion plan in Siberia. The American fast-food giant intends to open three new outlets in Novosibirsk and four eateries in Omsk by year's end.","Russian food safety inspectors from the agency Rospotrebnadzor temporarily suspended operations in four McDonald's branches Wednesday .

"By . Reuters . and Damien Gayle for MailOnline . Fifteen bodies have been recovered so far from the scene of last night's rocket strike on a refugee convoy, says the Ukrainian military. It is understood the convoy of buses and cars was packed with civilians fleeing heavy fighting between Ukrainian government forces and separatist rebels near Luhansk. Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian military, told Reuters: 'By 7 p.m. last night we retrieved 15 bodies ... The search continued into the night and is continuing today.' Ukrainian soldiers load a Grad missile during fighting with separatists near Luhansk: A Ukrainian official says dozens of civilians were killed when separatist shelled a convoy of refugees trying to flee eastern Ukraine . Total war: News of the attack broke last night, with Ukrainian officials claiming that the victims of what was described as an artillery strike were burned alive after they were trapped in the vehicles . As the row over the refugee convoy attack intensified, Russia faced accusations of 'throwing new swarms of mercenaries and columns of military equipment' to back up rebels in east Ukraine. New pictures showed Russian military units moving close to the border, as Ukraine's army continued making significant advances into rebel-held areas. Kiev claims that some of this armoured hardware as well as Grad missile systems are crossing the border in support of the separatist cause, allegations strongly denied by Moscow. But the Kremlin was making little attempt to hide its show of force in the Rostov region, which borders both Ukraine's Luhansk and Donetsk regions. Some 13 trucks which were seen yesterday carrying tanks towards the border were today spotted empty and moving in the direction of the city of Rostov-on-Don, said locals in an area some 30 miles from the border. There is no proof that the the tanks crossed into rebel-held Ukraine. But Dmitry Tymchuk, a Ukrainian military reserve officer and self-styled analyst, said rebel counter attacks had increasd 'in many directions'. 'There are constant attacks on our positions in the area of Savur-Mohyla. Fierce fighting is currently underway for the settlements of Yasynuvata, Makiivka, Zhdanivka, and others,' he claimed. 'And during this time, the Kremlin keeps throwing in more new 'Grads' to the border.' A Russian tank is seen moving in Rostov, near to the border with east Ukraine: Some 13 trucks which were seen yesterday carrying tanks towards the border were today spotted empty . Reinforcements? There is no proof that the the tanks crossed into rebel-held Ukraine. But Dmitry Tymchuk, a Ukrainian military reserve officer and self-styled analyst, said rebel counter attacks had increasd . Ukrainian government forces blame last night's attack on a refugee convoy on pro-Russian separatists they are battling in the area around the rebel-held city of Luhansk. The rebels have denied responsibility. At least one rebel leader suggested no attack had occurred. The military said today many of those killed, who included women and children, had been burned beyond recognition. Many bodies had been blown apart by the blast. The U.S. State Department condemned the attack on the convoy, which was near an area of heavy fighting between Khryashchuvatye and Novosvitlivka, but said it could not confirm who was responsible. 'We strongly condemn the shelling and rocketing of a convoy that was bearing internally displaced persons in Luhansk ... Sadly, they were trying to get away from the fighting and instead became victims of it,' State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf told a news briefing in Washington. News of the attack broke last night, with Ukrainian officials claiming that the victims of what was described as an artillery strike were burned alive after they were trapped in the vehicles. Military spokesman Anatoly Proshin told Ukrainian news channel 112.ua: 'A powerful artillery strike hit a refugee convoy near the area of Khryashchuvatye and Novosvitlivka. 'The force of the blow on the convoy was so strong that people were burned alive in the vehicles - they weren't able to get themselves out.' Colonel Lysenko said at a briefing last night: 'Many people were killed, among them women and children.'

Trench warfare in Europe: Fighting across eastern Ukraine has forced nearly 344,000 people to flee their homes.The UN says about 155,800 have left for other places inside Ukraine while 188,000 have fled into Russia . A senior rebel leader denied his forces had the military capability to conduct such an attack, and accused the government of regularly attacking the area including with Russian-made Grad missiles. 'The Ukrainians themselves have bombed the road constantly with airplanes and Grads. It seems they've now killed more civilians like they've been doing for months now. 'We don't have the ability to send Grads into that territory,' said Andrei Purgin, deputy prime minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic. Ihor Plotnitskyi, acting governor of the self-appointed Lugansk People's Republic (LPR), said the Ukrainian allegations the convoy was hit by a Russian supplied Grad missile were lies. 'I declare this fact is not a reality,' he said. 'The LPR army never shelled refugees or citizens' homes. No Grad unit was provided to us by Russia. 'All combat equipment is captured and was obtained in battles against the enemy.' But Tymchuk hit back, claiming: 'We are accustomed to the fact that the insurgents deliberately fire at the houses of local residents, at combat ambulances with the wounded, and use peaceful civilians as human shields.' He labelled the alleged attack 'the apotheosis of savagery and villainy. This is the very essence of terrorism under the Russian flag.' The road where the attack happened is likely to be the one that a convoy of Russian humanitarian aid would take if Ukraine allows it into the country. Fighting across eastern Ukraine has forced nearly 344,000 people to flee their homes, according to UN figures. The UN says about 155,800 have left for other places inside Ukraine while 188,000 have fled into Russia.","At least one rebel leader suggested no attack on refugees had occurred .

"By . Will Stewart for MailOnline . Russian model  Marina Sashina, 26, revealed her flag was defiled with yellow paint during a rehearsal for the World Bikini Model International  Final in Beijing . A 'dirty tricks' allegation has emerged at an international bikini pageant after the Russian contestant claimed she was victimised because of her loyalty to Vladimir Putin's policies over Ukraine. Model and TV presenter Marina Sashina, 26, revealed that her tricolour Russian flag was defiled with yellow paint during a rehearsal in Beijing. She is one of 48 contestants from 46 countries in China for the World Bikini Model International 2014 Final. 'Marina left the flag in dressing room for literally a couple of minutes, and then came back and found the Russian tricolour smeared with paint,' said her spokeswoman Valentina Gurova. 'It is noteworthy that in the flags of the USA, Germany and Ukraine were nearby, but they remained intact.' Sushina stormed: 'To my great regret, the policy of double standards of the West has reached the beauty industry. 'I was moved to tears. It was painful to see the Russian flag desecrated.' Evidently blaming a Western contestant for carrying out the act, though not naming the suspected culprit, she said such actions were inappropriate at a beauty event far from Ukraine. In a show of goodwill she posed with the Ukrainian contestant at the pageant but stressed: 'I am sure it was a provocation by the other contestants - the representatives of countries that do not support the policy of Russia. 'The reason for this could be my interview at a press conference, in which I clearly outlined my views on the current political situation in the world,' she explained. 'I believe that the biased assessment of the situation in Ukraine, and the policy of double standards, led to a quarrel between two friendly nations - Russia and Ukraine.' Sashina lives in Moscow but is from Rostov on Don, capital of a region where Russian troops have massed close to the border with Ukraine, causing alarm in Kiev and the West. Ms Sashina (first from left) is one of 48 contestants from 46 countries competing  in China . The 26-year-old model said she was 'moved to tears' after seeing her Russian flag desecrated . She has made little secret of her positive view on Putin's polices and appears to be a poster girl for the Kremlin president. 'Sadly our country now is in state conflict with the US - a 'cold' conflict,' she said. She does not think it will become a full-blown war 'because our president Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin and the American president are full of common sense. They understand what the war is - only death and tragedy.

'But I am sure that if there are serious attacks on our country, Russia can answer. 'We have all the weapons to protect our homeland, our borders, our people.' She claimed that Western sanctions against Russia would only make her motherland stronger. 'The answer the question of who will suffer more in this confrontation, we can see very soon,' she said. 'In the meantime, I look forward with hope and envision Russian prosperity and welfare.

"By . Leon Watson . At least 50 British families have had their holidays ruined after being struck down with violent vomiting and diarrhoea at a five-star hotel. The outbreak of the bug happened at the £200-per night Lindos Imperial on the Greek island Rhodes. So far it has lasted ten days but staff are reportedly still letting people check in, insisting it is not serious. The hotel where 50 British families have been struck down by a vomiting bug is on the Greek island of Rhodes (file picture of Lindos) First aid desks have been erected to assess guests before allowing them to enter restaurants and public areas. One family of three, of Northallerton, North Yorkshire, spent £3,000 on their holiday through Jet2. They fell ill almost immediately and spent almost a week in their room before shelling out to fly home. The manager claimed no more that 100 people had been affected and insisted the outbreak is not due to poor hygiene at his hotel. But one guest posted on TripAdvisor: 'Unfortunately the entire holiday experience was ruined by an outbreak of what I suspect, as a doctor myself, to be a viral gastroenteritis, possibly Norovirus. 'I became ill with violent vomiting and profuse watery diarrhoea on the Monday evening, my older son on Tuesday morning, husband on Tuesday evening and younger son Tuesday night. 'An outbreak such as this can happen in an environment such as this quite easily. That is not so much the issue. The issue lies with the appalling manner in which it was handled by the hotel. 'The private doctor did not lay a hand on a patient, was of little help with advice on rehydration and management of personal hygiene and couldn't wait to get away fast enough!' Another said: 'The bug struck all of us in the early hours of Tuesday. I thought it was just us until I went to reception to see the chaos. 'I called for a doctor, who was already on site because he had seen so many already.' In response, the manager said: 'We have experienced a sickness bug that affected some guest’s; the symptoms they experienced were high temperature, vomiting and diarrhea. 'The guests who stayed in their rooms were feeling better within 24 – 48 hours with the aid of simple medication.' Jet2 is 'facilitating requests for an early return' and offering alternative trips to people heading to the venue. Earlier this month it was revealed at least 70 British holidaymakers were struck down by a vomiting bug that ruined breaks at two resorts in Spain. At least 50 fell ill at Club Mac Alcudia, on the Balearic island of Mallorca, and 20 at Stil Victoria Playa, on the neighbouring island of Menorca. A sickness bug also left at least 100 British tourists ill, with several on drips after it swept through an Egyptian holiday resort. Holidaymakers at the Coral Sea Waterworld complex were affected by the bug, thought to be Shigella, which causes diarrhoea, stomach cramps and fever. People staying at the four-star resort in Sharm el Sheikh said some tourists were confined to their rooms during the majority of their stay at the hotel, with some on intravenous drips. Many of those affected blamed the outbreak on poor hygiene and dirty utensils and buffet containers.","Outbreak has lasted ten days but staff are still letting people check in .

"By . Ian Drury for the Daily Mail . Sir James Munby (pictured), the country’s top family law judge, said allowing the press to see files would allow reporters to understand sensitive cases better . Secretive documents on cases in the family courts could be disclosed to the Press to help them ‘perform their watchdog role’, a leading judge said yesterday. Sir James Munby, the country’s top family law judge, said it would allow reporters to understand sensitive cases better – and help safeguard against miscarriages of justice. The president of the Family Division said the proposal would be one way of ‘opening up’ the notoriously secret court to ‘public scrutiny’. Cases of children being taken from their parents into state care, adoption, and where children should live when families break up are normally held behind closed doors or have strict reporting restrictions. Members of the public could also be permitted into the family courts to watch their secretive hearings. The proposals, outlined in a consultation document, are a boost to the Daily Mail’s campaign against court cases being held in private after we exposed a series of scandals resulting from justice being conducted in private. We have highlighted controversial decisions made behind closed doors in the family courts and the even more secretive Court of Protection, which deals with the affairs of vulnerable adults. Unveiling his plans on ending secrecy in the family courts, Sir James said: ‘There is a need for greater transparency in order to improve public understanding of the court process and confidence in the court system.’ He added: ‘The public has a legitimate interest in being able to read what is being done by the judges in its name.’ He said he would consult lawyers, judges, social services chiefs, the media and families about the possibility of ‘hearing in public of certain types of family case'. In the past, such cases have always been closed to the public because of fears that neighbours and those who knew the families could attend the hearings and then spread damaging gossip about children. Reporters were only allowed to attend after then Justice Secretary Jack Straw changed the law in 2009 – but they can still be thrown out by a judge under special circumstances. After receiving submissions on the proposals, he will publish another consultation paper before running a pilot exercise. Sir James also suggested a trial allowing media should also be allowed access to more paperwork involved in family cases, including arguments, summaries, fact-finding documents and experts’ reports. Reporters were only allowed to attend family law court cases after then Justice Secretary Jack Straw (pictured) changed the law in 2009 – but they can still be thrown out by a judge under special circumstances . He said he was aware of ‘nervousness’ among professionals in the family justice system but argued it would help ‘facilitate their understanding of the case and to assist them in performing their watchdog role’. He said the Press could then ‘decide quickly whether the case is one they would wish to attend, as they are entitled to do so.’ Sir James’ proposals do not cover the controversial Court of Protection, set up under Labour’s Mental Capacity Act in 2007 to decide on the lives of those too ill to make their own decisions. Earlier this year, the Mail’s campaign scored a huge victory when Sir James announced decisions by secret courts that can lead to children being taken from their parents or old people forced into care homes are finally to be opened up to public scrutiny. He said judgments in the family courts and the Court of Protection must be made public except in cases where there is a clear reason to dictate they should not be. Over the past year, we have highlighted scandals in the Court of Protection including the secret imprisonment of a 50-year-old woman and a forced caesarean on an Italian woman who was then made to give up her child for adoption.","Sir James Munby said it would allow reporters to understand cases better .

"By . Ian Drury for the Daily Mail . The UK’s borders offer ‘no hurdles’ for British jihadis returning from Iraq and Syria intent on launching a ‘massacre of the innocents’, it was claimed last night. A former policeman warned that Islamist fighters who had sneaked out of the country ‘under the radar’ of the police and security services would be ‘welcomed home’ by inadequate immigration controls at British airports. And he raised the terrifying prospect that unknown extremists could cause carnage on UK streets using terror tactics learned on Middle East battlefields, such as building homemade bombs. Warning: Chris Hobbs, former immigration officer, said calls to bolster border controls has fallen on deaf ears . Chris Hobbs, a retired Special Branch officer who worked intercepting suspected criminals at UK airports for more than ten years, said repeated calls to successive Home Secretaries to bolster border controls had ‘fallen on deaf ears’. He said ministers were more concerned with preventing queues at airports than protecting the public – a claim described as ‘utter rubbish’ by the Home Office. Mr Hobbs spoke out after Labour MP Khalid Mahmood claimed that as many as 2,000 British Muslims had travelled to fight a ‘holy war’ in Iraq and Syria. The security services claim the number is 500, with 250 having already returned. The Metropolitan Police veteran, who served 32 years before leaving in 2011, said it was ‘scandalous’ that embarkation controls had not been reintroduced after being scrapped by Labour in 1998. These controls were staffed by immigration officers who would examine passports and scrutinise passengers as they passed through to their flights. Suspicious people would be flagged up to Special Branch. But Mr Hobbs said that nowadays body and hand baggage searches and passport checks would be conducted by private security guards employed by airport authorities or airline personnel as they boarded their planes. He claimed ‘99 out of 100’ passengers would not pass ‘under the eyes’ of a UK counter-terrorism officer. Instead, hard-pressed officers would monitor ‘target’ flights at the airport gates – those heading for certain destinations. For instance, flights to Turkey – often used as a transit point by British Muslims travelling to Syria – might be monitored. Fears: More than 500 Britons are feared to be fighting for ISIS  and could come home . Mr Hobbs said that on their return to Britain, extremists who had not come to the attention of the security services would face little attention at passport control. He said UK Border Force officers were discouraged from asking even the most basic questions of travellers. Instead they simply scan passports against terror and criminal watchlists and compare the photograph in the document with the person in front of them – another claim vehemently denied by the Home Office. Mr Hobbs said: ‘The medieval savagery inflicted upon James Foley by, in all probability, a British national and the perceived support of the UK government for those ranged against this so-called Islamic State can only bring the prospect of a “massacre of the innocents” in the UK even closer. ‘There is clearly still a very real need to prevent further individuals from leaving the UK to engage in acts of terror in other parts of the world. ‘An equal priority needs to ensure that jihadists returning to the UK are detected and arrested before they can inflict mayhem in our towns and cities. ‘If that means that the priority of avoiding air and sea port passenger queues has to be removed then so be it. ‘Police and security services have performed outstandingly well in frustrating a number of planned attacks yet the increasing numbers of UK jihadists suggests that their task is becoming almost impossible. ‘Thus the case for strengthening our borders by reintroducing exit controls and strengthening passport controls upon arrival is surely an unanswerable one. Currently there are practically no hurdles.’ Mr Mahmood, MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, said: ‘The Government has not got a handle on how to deal with people coming in and out of the country – people are coming and going as they please without being asked any questions. ‘They might have been in the Middle East for education or employment, but at least ask them.’ The Home Office said embarkation controls were being reintroduced next spring to boost intelligence on who was in the UK. A source at the department said border officers had vast terror and criminal databases at their fingertips. Some 95 per cent of travellers arriving at Britain’s airports underwent checks. He said border officers routinely questioned arriving passengers and said it was ‘utter rubbish’ to suggest the Border Force prioritised queues over security.","Chris Hobbs intercepted suspected criminals at UK airports for 10 years .

"By . Ian Drury for the Daily Mail . Ninety rapists have received only a caution since the Coalition came to power, even though the crime carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, shocking new figures have revealed. Critics said Britain was in the grip of a ‘caution culture’ which let thousands of serious criminals get away with just a slap on the wrist. Despite ministers insisting cautions are ‘inappropriate’ for serious offences, a staggering 70 sexual and violent offenders a week received one in the past four years. Scroll down for video . Over the last four years police have issued cautions for almost 15,000 offences that would typically result in jail prompting critics to blast the system which they claim is undermining the public's faith in the law (file picture) In total, police issued almost 15,000 for offences that would typically result in jail – including 2,279 for sexual assault, 783 for robbery and 11,347 for burglary. Critics said the use of cautions for grave crimes was undermining the public’s faith in the ability of the justice system to properly punish offenders. The damning statistics will fuel concerns that police and public prosecutors are too overwhelmed to deal with serious crimes. In 1971, only 6 per cent of offenders were given a caution, which carries no sanction except a reprimand. The figure reached 20 per cent by last year, though this was down from 31 per cent in 2007. Peter Cuthbertson, of the Centre For Crime Prevention, said: ‘A caution is never acceptable for crimes like rape or robbery. ‘There is a real problem of police cautioning serious offenders just so their figures show the crime was dealt with, even if it was actually dealt with in a ridiculously trivial way. Police need to tackle this culture immediately. ‘The overuse of cautions is putting the public at very great risk.’ David Green, chief executive of think-tank Civitas, said: ‘This is appalling. The police and prosecutors like them because they involve very little work. You just get someone to admit it and you’ve got a detection. ‘But they leave the public unprotected because you have a violent offender who is not in prison. ‘If a robber is in jail he won’t be threatening you with a knife in the street telling you to hand over your money.’ In 1971, only six per cent of offenders were given a caution compared to 20 per cent last year (file picture) There were 181,000 cautions issued last year which meant the offender avoided being hauled before the courts – including 29,560 handed out to criminals by the Metropolitan Police. The statistics were revealed by the Ministry of Justice following a Parliamentary question. Shadow Justice Secretary Sadiq Khan said: ‘The public need confidence that criminals are being properly dealt with, being both punished and reformed. ‘There is a caution culture driven by this government cutting corners trying to do justice on the cheap. For many victims of crime this is justice denied. Under this government’s watch too many cautions for serious, violent and sexual offences are being dished out, which is a slap in the face for victims. ‘Cautions inappropriately used for heinous and horrific crimes will lead to the public questioning whether the justice system is on the side of the law-abiding.’ Cautions became widely used for a host of serious crimes, including sex attacks and burglary, as police came under pressure to hit targets for ‘offenders brought to justice’. They appear on a criminal’s record but do not result in further punishment. At the same time they allow the force to declare a crime ‘solved’, improving its conviction rate. Rules stating criminals should not normally receive more than a single caution were routinely flouted. Experts say the main beneficiaries have been young offenders. Under the Coalition, the number of people cautioned for rape, burglary, robbery or sexual assaults has dropped from 4,273 in 2010 to 2,680 in 2013 – indicating Justice Secretary Chris Grayling is keeping his pledge to get tough on crime. Ministers said cautions should be used for dealing with ‘low-level, mainly first-time offending’. Police say that in some sex cases the victim did not want to go to court so cautions were handed out as it allowed the criminal to be put on the sex offenders’ register for two years. Cautions were issued for rape only in ‘exceptional circumstances’ when it was deemed ‘not in the public interest to prosecute’. It is understood many such cases involved either under-18s, older people who committed rape a long time ago or those who may have been a partner of the victim. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: ‘These figures show clearly why I changed the rules at the end of last year to stop cautions being used for crimes like this unless the circumstances are quite exceptional. We are also stopping the use of cautions for repeat crimes. ‘We have already changed the guidelines for police officers, and are now passing a new law to tighten up the regime. People have to be able to have confidence in our justice system, and serious crimes should go to court and not be dealt with by a caution. ‘Under this Government offenders are more likely to go to jail, and for longer. Victims of crime expect no less.’ A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘The Government is clear that serious offences should always be brought to court and, to ensure that there is increased public confidence in the justice system, last year announced limits on the use of simple cautions. ‘These changes restrict the use of cautions for indictable only offences and certain serious either way offences unless there are exceptional circumstances and a senior police officer, as well as the Crown Prosecution Service for certain cases, has agreed that a caution should be administered.’","Police issued 15,000 cautions for offences that would usually result in prison .

"By . Ted Thornhill for MailOnline . and Reuters . An 83-year-old man has admitted that he hid at least $1.1million from tax inspectors over a period of 25 years in Swiss and Israeli bank accounts, using the code phrase 'hot lips' to communicate with bankers. Bernard Kramer, from Delray Beach, Florida, pleaded guilty to conspiracy at a Manhattan federal court and could face five years in jail. He has been ordered to pay a $588,042 penalty and is now aiding a government inquiry into his affairs. Secret accounts: Bernard Kramer, from Delray Beach, Florida, admitted that he hid at least $1.1million from tax inspectors over a period of 25 years in Swiss and Israeli bank accounts . According to court papers made public on Tuesday, Kramer, who has also lived in New Jersey, began evading taxes around 1987 when he opened the undeclared account at an unnamed Swiss bank. Upon learning in 2008 that U.S. authorities were probing UBS AG for helping U.S. taxpayers conceal accounts, Kramer remained determined to keep hiding his money. In around March 2010 he arranged to move it to a new, undeclared account at an Israeli bank that was also not named, the papers show. Kramer failed to report interest and income from these accounts to the Internal Revenue Service from 1987 to 2012 and failed to file a U.S. Treasury form known as the Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts, or FBAR, detailing his holdings, the papers show. Code: Kramer used the phrase 'hot lips' to communicate with bankers in Switzerland . During Tuesday's court hearing, Kramer said he met regularly in New York with a representative of the Swiss bank to discuss his account and that 'it was understood' the account's existence would remain a secret from tax authorities. He and bank staff used the code name 'Hot Lips' to refer to the account, prosecutors said. His defense lawyer, Brian Ketcham, declined to identify the banks after the hearing. Dozens of U.S. taxpayers have been charged in the United States since the crackdown on using Swiss bank accounts to evade U.S. taxes became public. More than 45,000 Americans have paid about $6.5 billion in back taxes, interest and penalties under voluntary IRS amnesty programs, the agency said in June. In May, Credit Suisse Group AG agreed to pay roughly $2.6 billion in penalties and pleaded guilty to helping Americans avoid taxes, in settlements with various regulators. UBS agreed in 2009 to a $780 million penalty. Kramer faces up to five years in prison on the top count against him and more than $600,000 in restitution and penalties, prosecutors said.","Bernard Kramer, from Florida, hid $1.1m from the IRS for around 25 years .

Leslie, who died in June aged 96, never spoke of how he cheated death, suffered malaria in Egypt, was bombed in Greece and took part in the D-Day landings. But he secretly typed up his 10-page 'My Wartime Story' - which Julia discovered among his papers shortly after his death. Secret life: A World War II veteran kept his harrowing stories secret until he died and his wife of 69 years only found out after he died. Leslie Knight, 96, never mentioned he had survived malaria in Egypt or being bombed in Greece as a soldier the Royal Army Ordnance Corps. Picture shows Leslie (now deceased) and Julia on their 60th wedding anniversary . Almost until the end he’d never spoken to anyone of his experiences during the Second World War. While battling dementia in his final days, she’d sometimes find him with a tear in his eye, speaking of 'poor boys' lost in the conflict. Shortly after he died in May, Mrs Knight and daughter Ellen Gooding discovered an A4 envelope with: 'My Wartime Story' written on it. Inside were ten printed pages, secretly typed up over 16 months in 2006 and 2007, giving a matter-of-fact account of his role in the conflict. It detailed how Leslie, a Royal Army Ordnance Corps soldier, cheated death several times, including suffering malaria in Egypt and being bombed in Greece, and told of many of the friends he had lost. Mrs Knight, 92, said: 'Near the end he started to talk. He never used to show emotion, but every time I came in he was wiping his eyes. 'He kept saying ""poor boy"" and ""he never had a chance""' 'Before that we had been married 69 years and he never mentioned it - he didn’t want people to know.' Discovery: Leslie had secretly typed up his 10-page 'My Wartime Story' - which Julia discovered among his papers shortly after his death . Mrs Knight said she found his accounts while she was looking for insurance papers and wills. She said: 'When we read it I was quite shocked at what he’d been through. It was very powerful and very sad.' The couple met after Mr Knight survived the D-Day landings. He ended up in a pub Mrs Knight’s family owned in Brussels at the end of 1944. Both had been previously engaged, but both lost their partners during the war. Mrs Knight returned after the German surrender of June 1945 with an engagement ring, and they got married on August 25. Young love: The couple, pictured on their wedding day, met after Mr Knight survived the D-Day landings. He ended up in a pub Mrs Knight’s family-owned in Brussels at the end of 1944 . After living in various places, including with Leslie’s parents in Thorrington, they settled in a newly-built council house off Monkwick Avenue, Colchester, where they lived for more than 60 years. Leslie’s funeral in June was held at Monkwick’s St Margaret Church, which he helped to build in the Sixties and Seventies when he was not working for Crittall Windows in Witham. Hero: Mrs Knight described her husband as a generous man who was always helping people. He left daughter Ellen, 59, and grandsons Daniel and Anthony . Mrs Knight described her husband as a generous man who was always helping people. He left daughter Ellen, 59, and grandsons Daniel and Anthony. Leslie Knight wrote how, after signing up and going through training shortly after the war broke in 1939, he had been posted to Egypt to confront the Italians. He was soon struck down with malaria and rushed to hospital in Alexandria, where he had a 'miraculous escape from death'. After recuperating in Cairo, Leslie was sent to Greece early in 1941. There, near the city of Larissa, his unit was attacked by German bombers. He wrote: 'I then ran to what I thought was an empty shelter and fell onto a young mother with her baby. 'It was then that I realised what war was all about and we parted as I prayed to our Lord for her. I had lost my unit and everything that goes with it.' Leslie fled to Athens and then Crete, where the British army mounted a fierce resistance before again retreating in a convoy which was repeatedly attacked by German bombers. Respite finally came back in Egypt until he was sent to the Middle East before linking up with General Montgomery’s Desert Rats. After successfully pushing through Africa into Italy, Leslie was ordered to port and 'back to Blighty' early in 1944. He recalled: 'I can remember whilst doing a Guard-duty listening to a nightingale and thinking to myself how wonderful it was to be back in England'. But Leslie’s war was not over. By June he was in a landing craft and taking part in D-Day. He wrote: 'When daylight came the sight [was] formidable, noise most deafening [and] weather rough as we approached the French Coast. 'Order was given as we approached the coast for the front of the craft to be set down... 'Bombs and gunfire was everywhere. On dry land it was foot down and driving as quickly as things would allow.' Leslie’s unit made it to Brussels, where he met his future wife. By then, his active involvement in the war was effectively at an end.","Leslie Knight died in June age 96 .

"By . Australian Associated Press . How do you celebrate if you've just become the oldest person ever to swim across the English Channel? If you're Cyril Baldock from Bondi you crack open a couple of coldies. The 70-year-old Australian on Wednesday wrote his name into the record books by becoming the oldest person to swim from Dover in England to Cap Gris Nez in France. 'I'm having a couple of beers for medicinal purposes only, to make myself sleep,' Baldock told AAP after completing the 34km feat in 12 hours and 45 minutes. The beer tasted a lot better than the large quantities of sea water he swallowed during the choppy crossing which left him feeling 'pretty crook'. Cyril Baldock's spirits are still high at the halfway mark . The 70-year-old Australian on Wednesday wrote his name into the record books by becoming the oldest person to swim from Dover in England to Cap Gris Nez in France . Baldock, aged 70 years and nine months, has replaced Englishman Roger Allsopp in the record books. Allsopp was five months younger when, in 2011, he took almost 18 hours to cross the Channel. While the Australian's time was much quicker there was a period towards the end when Baldock wasn't sure he would reach the French coastline. 'Around the 10-hour mark I had a bad half-hour and was starting to worry a bit,' he said after returning to Dover on the boat that had earlier escorted him to Cap Gris Nez. 'The arms were really sore, and I didn't seem to be making much ground, but I kicked on again.' Baldock knew how tough the swim would be having previously crossed the Channel in 1985 as a 41-year-old. Back then the feat took him 10 hours and 44 minutes. The strict rules of long-distance swimming meant Baldock wasn't wearing a wetsuit on Wednesday but rather regular speedos, a single swimming cap and goggles. There was no shark cage either. The Bondi local has the record for now but it could be short-lived with Brisbane woman Irene Keel, 73, also planning an attempt this week. Baldock, impressively, will be cheering her on. 'The great part of it is, if she did it, Australians would then have the oldest man and the oldest woman,' he said. 'I'll have held the oldest person for some time - that was the goal and that's done - so I really hope she does (succeed).' Australian Trent Grimsey holds the record for the fastest Channel crossing having completed the marathon in six hours 55 minutes flat in 2012. If Keel makes it to France it's unlikely Baldock will try and reclaim the title in three or fours years' time. 'I've hung my cap and goggles up as far as I'm concerned,' he said on Wednesday. 'You can't go on forever doing that sort of thing - I'm nearly 71.' Baldock was fulfilling a decades-old promise to his former coach Des Renford by completing the crossing. He was also raising money for cancer research via everydayhero.com.au/event/cyrilsswim.","Baldock swam 34km from Dover in England to Cap Gris Nez in France .

"By . Australian Associated Press . Poor work and bad weather caused part of a building site and a driveway to collapse into a northern Sydney construction pit, an engineer says. Wet weather is hampering efforts to stabilise a three-storey Collaroy unit block just four metres from the pit. 'It's unfortunate that this continuing wet weather appears to have softened the ground around and they've had a collapse due to inadequate shoring,' geotechnical engineer David Dickson told the Seven Network. The unit block in Sydney's northern beaches was evacuated after land gave way at the building site newxt door . The 12 units were evacuated after emergency services were called early on Tuesday due to a gas main being ruptured in the collapse. It's been fixed and gas has been restored to the units but the residents won't be able to return home for at least one night. 'The evacuations will remain in place until the area is deemed safe,' police said. The collapse was blamed not just on the weather but poor workmanship . The 12 units were evacuated after emergency services were called early on Tuesday due to a gas main being ruptured in the collapse . Neighbour Wendy Hill, who lives in a heritage-listed house, said the development had been 'scary'. 'The development which is literally one metre from our house down nine metres has been causing us a lot of sleepless nights,' she said. Fire crews and engineers have been assessing the site all day and builders have been told to backfill under the collapsed driveway.

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . and Ted Thornhill for MailOnline . Just hours after introducing himself to L.A. Clippers fans with a 'larger than life' performance at a rally, the former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer announced that he is stepping down from the company's board. Ballmer's decision brings to a close 34 years with the software giant. He said he plans to devote more time not only to his new basketball team, but also civic contributions, teaching and study. Microsoft published Ballmer's resignation letter on its website on Tuesday along with a response from current CEO Satya Nadella thanking him and wishing him well. Scroll down for video . Something to shout about: After 34 years at Microsoft, former CEO Steve Ballmer has announced that he is stepping down to focus on his latest role as the owner of the L.A. Clippers . The 58-year-old says he plans to hold on to his Microsoft stock and will continue to offer feedback on products and strategy. With 333.3 million shares worth $15 billion, Ballmer's 4 percent stake in the company makes him the largest individual holder of Microsoft shares. A few institutional investors hold slightly more. ‘I bleed Microsoft - have for 34 years and I always will,’ Ballmer wrote. ‘I will be proud, and I will benefit through my share ownership. I promise to support and encourage boldness by management in my role as a shareholder in any way I can.’ Ballmer stepped down as chief executive in February, and since then Microsoft shares have risen about 24 percent. He says his resignation from the board is timely as the company prepares for its next shareholder meeting set for sometime this fall. Nadella thanked Ballmer for his support during the transition period and used the opportunity to reiterate the company's new focus on mobile devices and cloud computing. Ballmer's enthusiasm was clear to see, with the Clippers' new owner even chest-bumping fans . New Los Angeles Clippers owner Steve Ballmer, center, fires up the crowd as he speaks at the Clippers Fan Festival on Monday in Los Angeles . ‘Under your leadership, we created an incredible foundation that we continue to build on - and Microsoft will thrive in the mobile-first, cloud-first world,’ Nadella said. Ballmer made a memorable entrance at the Staples Center on Monday evening. With Eminem's Lose Yourself playing over the PA, he made his way through the crowd exchanging high-fives and chest-bumping as he took the stage in front of 4,500 fans. Ballmer paid a record $2 billion for the team in a sale that was confirmed by a judge last week. The name of disgraced former owner Donald Sterling, who controlled the team for 33 years before being banned for life by the NBA for racist remarks, was never uttered during the rally. 'We're looking forward,' Ballmer proclaimed, having removed his blue Clippers hat. 'Everything is about looking forward.' Ballmer's fervor was in stark contrast to Sterling, who never spoke to the media and was famously frugal when it came to spending on the team during decades of losing - despite having amassed a fortune through real estate. 'Today is about this other guy who just happened to have two billion dollars in his pocket,' coach Doc Rivers joked on stage. 'I asked him are you sure it went through and he said, ""I know my bank account is minus two billion so I know something went through.""' Satisfied: Ballmer applauds after his rousing speech, which he gave to a crowd of around 4,500 people . An enthusiastic Ballmer, right, shakes hands with head coach Doc Rivers after speaking at the Clippers Fan Festival . Ballmer gave out his email address during the televised rally and was quick to assure fans he won't move the team to Seattle, where he's lived for 34 years. He was nearly an NBA owner last year before league owners chose to keep the Kings in Sacramento, rather than allow them to be sold to a group that included Ballmer and moved to Seattle. 'I love Los Angeles,' he said. 'Yes, I live in Seattle. We're not moving the Clippers to Seattle for a hundred reasons.' Ballmer used a microphone, but his booming voice easily filled the arena without it. He prowled the stage and gestured to make his points in the enthusiastic style he was known for among Microsoft employees. 'We're going to be bold. Bold means taking chances,' he said. 'We're going to be optimistic. We're going to be hard-core. Nothing gets in our way, boom! The hard-core Clippers, that's us.' Chris Paul, Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan were among eight players on hand, along with Rivers, who guided the Clippers to 57 wins last season, his first with the team. 'When he came through the crowd, I literally had goose bumps,' Griffin said afterward. 'I don't know if there's one good word to describe him. I know all our guys are excited about the energy he brings. It's completely different.' Ballmer took a few emailed questions from season ticket-holders, including a 26-year fan who asked how the next 26 years of the franchise would be different. 'I'll boldly say the Clippers will win many, many more Larrys in the next 26 years than they did in the last 26,' he said, referring to the Larry O'Brien trophy that goes to the NBA champion. Rivers clearly got a kick out of Ballmer's passionate display, cracking up at his new boss' proclamations after having previously seen him only on YouTube.

'I love energy,' Rivers said later. 'You get caught up in that and that's good. That was great for our fans.' Interim CEO Dick Parsons testified during the court battle over the team's sale that Rivers would quit if Sterling was the owner going into next season. 'Sometimes you do have to take a stand,' Rivers said. 'I didn't think I was going to have to (quit), but a lot of us were willing to for sure.' He added, 'You always have to move on. I have.' Ballmer gave the title 'owner emeritus' to Sterling's estranged wife, Shelly, who negotiated the deal. She will receive two floor seats, 10 other seats and parking at Staples Center for games. 'Without her this deal does not get done,' Rivers said afterward. 'She wants to be a fan. She's no longer the owner. I'm fine with that.' Ballmer shared dinner with Rivers and some of the players a night earlier, when the discussion focused on where he'll sit during games. Sterling sat at mid-court within earshot of the players. When someone suggested behind the Clippers' bench, like Dallas owner Mark Cuban does, Rivers said, 'I don't know if I could deal with that energy.'

"By . Josh Gardner for MailOnline . A Connecticut teen who was all but imprisoned in a Boston hospital for 16 months finally got the homecoming she deserved Sunday. At the same time, Justina Pelletier of West Hartford got the Sweet 16 party she couldn't have while forcibly separated from her friends and family. 'She's missed so many holidays, birthdays, anniversaries, Christmas, Easter and all the religious holidays,' Justina's father Lou Pelletier told FoxCT. Justina, who first checked in to Boston Children's Hospital in February 2013 with flu-like symptoms, was feeling better then she had in quite some time as 100 of her closest loved ones celebrated her return home. Home at last: Justina Pelletier was surrounded by friends and family in New Haven on Sunday as she celebrated her sweet 16 and homecoming after she was forcibly kept in a hospital for 16 months . Saga: Justina posed for photos with family and friends at an event some of them feared would never come after the teen was diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder and her parents accused of abusing her . 'I'm a princess': Justina's party was attended by 100 of her loved ones and featured a raffle and an auction . 'They've treated me so well. I feel like I'm a princess with a tiara,' said a beaming Justina. Even State Senator Markley, who worked with Connecticut and Massachusetts authorities to get Justina home was in attendance at the event, which included an auciton, a raffle and numerous tributes to Justina. The party was dubbed 'Sparkling Homecoming Party' because 'no one can ever dull Justina's sparkle.' 'She's so happy to have people here that have been fighting for, friends, family, people she's never met before,' said Lou Pelletier. Her parents say they hope will soon start school. Nowhere to turn: Lou and Linda Pelletier were accused of abusing their daughter after doctors different from her normal physician diagnosed her with a psychiatric disorder instead of with a physical one, as she'd been before . Suffering: Justina is now believed to suffer from mitochondrial disease. Her parents were allowed very little contact with them as she suffered in a Massachusetts hospital miles from her Connecticut home . 'It might take a long time, but I know I have a lot of people cheering me on,' she said. Justina's disease is hard to diagnose and, according to the Mito Action support group, parents have been suspected of child abuse and sufferers accused of somatization disorders or fabricating pain. Meanwhile, Somatoform Disorder is considered to be anxiety-related with sufferers feeling real pain that cannot be medically explained. Between 0.2 and 2 per cent of females and 0.2 per cent of men in the U.S. have been diagnosed as sufferers. Justina's family insisted she did not have Somatoform Disorder symptoms when she was admitted to Boston Children's Hospital. Justina couldn't see her family without a welfare supervisor or hospital staff member in the room. She was rarely allowed outside for fresh air and spends most of her time in a small room, off the main psychiatric ward, without even a television to occupy her time. She was finally reunited with her family in June. Still battling: A long road to recovery paved with physical therapy and more potential illnesses lay ahead for Justina . The Pelletiers are pictured while they were still fighting to get back custody of Justina . Justina was diagnosed with mitochondrial disease several years ago, a genetic condition that affects muscle coordination and mobility. The illness includes a group of neuromuscular diseases caused by damage to intracellular structures that produce energy. There is no cure for the condition that is progressive and can cause death. Symptoms can include weakness, intolerance for exercise, heart failure, dementia and rhythm disturbances. Every year 1,000 to 4,000 children in the United states are born with a mitochondrial disease. After being admitted to Boston Children's Hospital in February however doctors concluded the teenager was suffering from Somafotorm disorder, a psychological condition that causes . sufferers to feel pain, although there is no physical cause for it. Sufferers do not feign the physical symptoms they feel, rather they present themselves as the result of mental strain. Doctors cannot identify the sources of patients' pain and instead prescribe anti-depressants. Patients can become increasingly frustrated with the diagnosis as there is seemingly no explanation for their symptoms. Experts estimate that between 0.2 and 2 per cent of females and less than 0.2. per cent of men in the US suffer from the condition.","Justina Pelletier, 16, was admitted to Boston Children's Hospital in February 2013 suffering from flu on suggestion of normal doctor who was away .

"By . Josh Gardner for MailOnline . An Arizona pet owner arrived home Saturday to find his yard mobbed by an angry swarm of bees and his two 100-pound dogs laying motionless in the dirt. Lawrence Rios was horrified when he and a roommate saw the state of the beloved companions: one lay swollen and bloody while the other had ripped out his own claws in a desperate attempt to escape the fenced yard. Before they could help the dogs, the two men were forced to flee as the bees they described as the nastiest they'd ever seen turned their stingers on them. Sad: These two 100-pound dogs named Atlas and Gypsy were killed Saturday when a swarm of what may have been Africanized killer bees modded their Tucson, Arizona yard . Tragic reminder: Left behind were the carcasses of some of the bees, which chased away the dog's owner before firefighters arrived to fight back the bees by spraying foam . 'They were definitely not your average bee because most of them they're not like that unless you really mess with them but these bees were a whole other breed,' Robby DeCesari told KOLD. Rios called 911 and firefighters soon arrived to spray the yard with a foam that would keep the bees at bay. It was only then when Rios realized the extent of his dogs'--named Gypsy and Atlas--terrible injuries. 'I rushed them to the vet and they were both dead. These were both 100-pound dogs. Big dogs,' the emotional pet owner told Tucson News Now. The male dog, Atlas, suffered the worst. 'I've seen the claw missing on his paw, he had gashes all over his head trying to escape from the backyard to get away from the bees. And the other one was really swollen,' Rios said. It's a sad time for Rios, but he's thankful he and his roommate, who suffered just one sting, got out alive. 'Not your average bee': Dog owner Lawrence Rios (left) said he and his roommate Robby DeCesari were forced to flee before they could get help for the dogs . Noble friends: Rios rescued Gypsy, right, years ago and had more recently come to own Atlas, left . Rios believes the trouble began when a neighbor plugged the entrance to a nest hidden inside a cement wall between their properties, which he believes caused them to swarm. Africanized honey bees look identical to the native bees and it has yet to be determined which species killed Atlas and Gypsy. However, the so-called 'killer bees' have been a serious problem in southern Arizona for years. Last year was especially bad in the area after three times as many people suffered 50 or more stings from the testy bees -- and the problem was even worse in nearby Phoenix. Back in 2011, a southern Arizona hog farmer  watched in horror as thousands of bees swarmed a 1,000-pound hog during an attack that lasted about two hours. Horrific: Rios found evidence in the yard that the dogs desperately tried to escape the bees. Atlas even ripped out his own claws in the process .","Lawrence Rios arrived to his Tucson, Arizona home Saturday to find a swarm of unusually angry bees in his yard .

"By . Ruth Styles . Harry and Amelia have been revealed as the most popular names for babies born in England and Wales for the second year in a row. Amelia was the top girls' name in 2011 and 2012 for parents from all regions of England and Wales, according to the Office of National Statistics, while Harry topped the bill in all but three areas . Muhammad was the second most popular name for boys across England and Wales, once variations in spelling are taken into account. Scroll down for video . Popular princes: Harry topped the list of boys' names but William also made it into the top 10 . Famous: One Direction's Harry Styles and actor Harry Connick Jr (right) are also notable people with the name . Three different spellings of the name are listed in the top 100 names for boys from the Office for National Statistics. The most common is Muhammad, . which is in 19th place on the table. Mohammed comes 26th and Mohammad is . in 60th place. Overall the name was given 7,139 times in 2012, just 29 . behind Harry – which took the top spot. Muhammad was the most popular name for boys in London, Jack was picked by most in the north east while most Welsh parents went for Jacob. Riley has . replaced Joshua in the boys' list of names, climbing from number 13 to number eight, and also made the top one hundred girls' names. Other boys' names to make the top 10 include traditional monikers such as William, James and Thomas, as well as the more unusual Alfie. On the girls' chart, Mia and Isla replaced Ruby and Grace in the top 10 by climbing six and seven places from numbers 13 and 15 respectively to fill the seventh and eighth slots. Pretty: The most popular girls' name is shared by actress Amelia Warner (left) and pop star Amelia Lily (right) Newcomer: Riley has made it onto the boys' list and is also popular for girls such as model Riley Keough ( left) Actress Kate Winslet has a daughter named Mia, while Australian Isla Fisher made a string of successful films in 2012. Other famous parents to name their daughter Isla include Peter Phillips and his Canadian wife, Autumn. Also proving popular among parents of newborn girls were Olivia, Sophie, Isabella, Ava and Jessica. Another significant baby naming trend was the reappearance of vintage names such as Hugo, Sonny, Seth and Theodore for boys, and Ivy, Darcey, Tilly and Violet for girls, in the top 100. Names to fall out of favour and out of the top 100 included Lexie, Lauren, Tia and Kayla, and Joel, Hayden, Reece, Ben, John and Ashton. Reaction on the Mumsnet website pointed out that some names may have been even higher in the rankings if different spellings were taken into account. One reader called KittenofDoom, who noted that Mollie could be spelt in different ways, wrote: 'I have to say that the whole business of spelling variations makes a lot of these statistics somewhat misleading. 'I don't think you can make a convincing case for Mollie being a different name from Molly, which has been very popular for a while.' Another response posted from someone calling themselves meditrina added: 'I think the ""true"" top name for girls is Sophie/Sophia/Sofia - if you add them together, they are a few hundred more than Amelia (I rounded as was adding in head) 'Boys' top name is Harry, but Mohammed and variants is the true second place.' Lisa Penney, of the UK parenting club Bounty.com, believes that, while celebrity-styled or unusual names may be fun, parents know their children will 'probably have an easier ride in the playground if they choose a more traditional name - which is why more conservative names such as Harry and Amelia win out overall'. Noting that some 'vintage-style' names like Elsie, Frankie and Arthur have become popular again, she said: 'We are now seeing a growing trend for old man and old lady names. 'Many are given a contemporary spin by using the nickname for the traditional variation like Alfie, Archie, Bobby, Charlie, Frankie and Freddy. 'Today's baby trends change quickly and names that first seem unusual can quickly become common in the classroom. Just a few years ago Ava and Isla were relatively unheard of as a baby girl's name, yet now they are in the top 20.' Netmums founder Siobhan Freegard said: 'Baby names are a fascinating snapshot of the country's culture and, while we're still wild about Harry and Amelia, this year's two biggest baby name trends are retro Edwardian-style names and posh becoming common. 'Many mums are looking back into their family tree and selecting great- grandparents' names, while others are seeking names which would have seemed stuffy a decade ago but fit with the current retro vibe across the UK.' Hit television shows such as Strictly Come Dancing, which counts former ballerina Darcey Bussell as one of its judges, could also be responsible for boosting the popularity of the name Darcey, it was suggested. Odds on: George is likely to be a contender for top spot next year, as will Catherine and William . And Ms Freegard felt that reality television show Made In Chelsea, starring Hugo Taylor, has 'made posh names popular again'. She said: 'Hugo, Theodore and Tilly have leapt into the top 100 and will soon be just as likely to be heard on inner-city estates as the Kings Road. 'The Middletons have shown it's possible to move from pit to palace with the right type of name and behaviour, so thousands of parents will be hoping choosing an upmarket name helps their child do the same.' Names with a royal connection may be ones to watch out for in the future, it was suggested. This comes on the back of the popularity of the Duchess of Cambridge (the former Kate Middleton), the birth of Prince George and Zara Phillips' baby, which is due in the new year. Ladbrokes have revealed that George . is now long odds-on to feature in the Top 10 baby names for 2013 after . being given to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's new arrival last . month. Prince George's . father's name, William, currently occupies the ninth slot on the list, . and the bookmaker says it's odds-on to remain in the top 10, while Kate . or Catherine has been given odds of one to four to reappear on the . girls' list. Jessica . Bridge of Ladbrokes said: 'The country has fallen in love with the . Cambridges, and as far as the odds are concerned all of their names are . set to inspire parents-to-be in the next year.' 'Prince Harry's already been demoted by George in the line to . the throne and it looks like he could face another second finish to his . nephew thanks to his name.' Ms Penney added: 'We're also noticing that the name Pippa (Kate's sister) is experiencing a revival and predict that it'll be one to watch next year alongside whatever name Zara Phillips plumps for when she and Mike Tindall have their royal baby next year.'","Muhammad is most popular boys' name in London .

He went shopping that morning, buying the dresses and silver shoes for the girls. Mihayo made the girls dance in the dresses for their mother and grandmother when they arrived at his bungalow in the backyard of the Watsonia home of his ex-partner's parents. He then told them: 'Come back inside and we'll show mum something else in 10 minutes.' The court heard that Mihayo dressed the toddlers in ballerina dresses he bough them and filmed them dancing, moments before he murdered them . He took the girls into his bungalow and videoed them on his phone dancing to a song from the film Frozen. He then held a pillow over their faces until they stopped moving. When his ex-partner tried to enter the locked bungalow he said 'you'll know when they get here', the documents show. Police were soon bashing on the bungalow door and Mihayo shouted out, 'a minute please' while he finished dressing the girls in their ballerina outfits. Neighbours paid tribute to the two girls who were tragically murdered . Outside the Melbourne home of Savannah and Indianna who died earlier this year . Mihayo pleaded guilty to two counts of murder in the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Friday . The Tanzanian national later told police he had no reason for murdering his daughters but that it made sense to him at the time, the court documents said. He told police that they would not understand what he had been through and that providing a reason for his crime would make no difference. Mihayo appeared in court briefly via video-link to enter his guilty pleas. He will face a directions hearing in the Victorian Supreme Court in September ahead of his sentence.

"By . Wills Robinson for MailOnline . Two prisoners managed to escape from a semi-open prison by using a tractor to scale the perimeter, it has been revealed. Convicted robbers Shaine Tester, 25, and Sean Horsley, 45, are said to have fled the Category C&D HMP Blantyre House near Godhurst, Kent, by parking the vehicle against the metal fence before climbing the rest of the way. They were working in the grounds of the facility when they staged the elaborate escape and subsequently went on the run. Sean Horsley, 45, (left) and Shaine Tester, 25, (right) are said to have fled the Category C&D HMP Blantyre House by parking the vehicle against the metal fence before climbing the rest of the way . A short time after their escape they were arrested in connection with a robbery, detained for being unlawfully at large and are now back in custody. Guards inside the prison were first alerted when the pair of convicted robbers did not attend a routine roll call. A source told The Daily Star: 'We've seen ladders used to escape but never a tractor. 'It is big enough so that when pushed against a fence it provides enough a platform to get out.' An internal document seen by the paper read: 'They [the pair] had placed a tractor against the fence and then used metal fencing to reach the top.' Blantyre House has room for 122 prisoners and normally accommodates offenders who are preparing for release after serving three years or more of their sentence. The escape follows a string of recent cases which have seen inmates abscond from open prisons. In the most high-profile case Michael Wheatley, known as the ‘Skullcracker’, carried out a raid on a building society while on the run from HMP Standford Hill in Kent in May. The pair of convicted robbers were said to have been working in the grounds of the semi-open prison on the outskirts of Godhurst, Kent, when they carried out their escape . Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: 'It is clear that open prisons and temporary licence are important tools in rehabilitating long-term offenders but they will not be used at the expense of public safety.' 'Absconds have reached record lows under this Government — falling by more than 80 per cent in the last 10 years — and more than 99 per cent of releases on temporary licence continue to pass without incident, but we have not been complacent and have made major changes to tighten the system. 'Following a comprehensive review we have tightened the eligibility for open prisons, introduced significant restrictions on who is granted temporary release and will be bringing in world-leading technology so we can monitor their whereabouts and help lower the numbers further.'","Shaine Tester, 25, and Sean Horsley, 45, fled Blantyre House in Kent .

"By . Wills Robinson for MailOnline . Fears over Britain's porous borders are growing as it is revealed that thousands of illegal immigrants are at large despite failing immigration checks . Figures show that there has been a dramatic increase in the proportion who vanish after failing checks once inside the country. Less than one in four are subsequently caught - meaning they have avoided detection while still inside the country. Less than one in four illegal immigrants are caught by UK immigration staff after failing immigration checks once they have made their way into the country . Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee said the figures are a 'real concern' considering the worsening 'security situation' at UK borders. The statistic obtained by The Sunday Telegraph showed that 3,527 immigrants absconded after failing immigration checks last year. Only 846 were found, meaning 76 per cent - around 2,700 - remained at large in the UK. Although the number who were still at large following failed checks has fallen from 9,362 in 2010 to 3,527 last year, the record for catching them has worsened. Keith Vaz said the figures are a 'real concern' considering the worsening 'security situation' at UK borders . In 2010, 58 per cent were subsequently caught, but by last year this figure had fallen to around a quarter (24 per cent). The worrying statistics come after it was revealed that one in five travellers is not counted in and out of Britain against criminal and terror checks because of IT failures and management blunders. Catastrophic IT failures and management blunders mean 20million passengers escape full screening every year. Six million people arriving by train – which includes Eurostar – do not undergo advance checks. Only 20 per cent of sea journeys are logged – the equivalent of ten million passengers slipping through the net without having their details compared against lists of killers and dangerous fanatics. A Home Office spokesman said: 'We take all breaches seriously and are determined to tackle immigration abuse. 'Most of these breaches occur when individuals fail to keep reporting appointments. Nobody has absconded from immigration detention or while under escort in 2013/14. 'We have rigorous security arrangements in place and if an individual does abscond, we work closely with the police and other agencies to locate them. 'Breaches remain under investigation until the individual has been located or it has been established that they have left the UK voluntarily. 'This causes a time lag in the figures and closure rates for 2013 and previous years will therefore continue to increase as time goes on.'","Less than one in four illegal immigrants are caught after failing checks .

"By . Wills Robinson for MailOnline . A father who was spotted digging an 8ft hole on a popular tourist beach has been criticised for putting his life in danger. The unidentified man dug the pit while he was with his family at Gorleston Beach near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, last Thursday. Local resident Steven Gilder, 55, was left horrified at his actions just three months after a girl nearly died when a structure half as deep caved in and trapped her. The unidentified man was seen digging a hole on Gorleston Beach near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, last week while a little girl, believed to be his daughter, kneeled precariously close to the edge . The grandfather claims the top of the 'dangerously deep' hole was  around 2ft higher than the man's head. Mr Gilder added that a little girl, who appeared to be the man's daughter, was also seen running around the edge of the hole. Now he has urged visitors and locals to take care on the beach - and not put any lives in danger. Mr Gilder, who lives near the beach, said: 'I couldn't believe what I was witnessing. Mother, and I assume her daughter, were playing happily together while the dad was digging a sand hole that was about two foot above is head. You could hardly see him. 'The little girl, who couldn't have been older than four, was running around the top edge of the hole. I just want to remind holidaymakers that it's not sensible.' The incident comes three months after Coastwatch volunteers had to step in to save a young girl from a 4ft deep hole which caved in on nearby Caister beach. The man's head is barely visible as a he continues to dig the unstable pit next to members of his family . A member of the rescue team watched as the girl 'disappeared' inside the pit which she and her family had dug in the sand. Fearing the sides of the hole could have collapsed at any minute the watchkeeper stepped in and advised her family to get her out. Volunteer Alan Perry said at the time: 'People, especially those on holiday, don't always see the dangers in front of them. 'We were up in the watchtower and we'd been keeping an eye on them, but it was when the girl got in and you couldn't see her that we knew we had to step in.'","Unidentified man was with his family on a Gorleston Beach in Norfolk .

"By . Jane Shilling . ME AFTER YOU: A TRUE STORY ABOUT LOVE, LOSS AND OTHER DISASTERS by Lucie Brownlee (Virago £11.99) They always say you should begin a book with a killer first line, and Lucie Brownlee certainly does that. ‘I knew He was dead,’ she writes. The He whom she reverently capitalises throughout her book (to disconcerting effect, as though she were writing about the Almighty) is — was — her 37-year-old husband, Mark, who collapsed and died two years ago while they were making love in Lucie’s mother’s bed. ‘She was out at the time, I hasten to add,’ Lucie explains, with the mordant humour that makes her memoir of early widowhood such a wrenchingly funny read. Mark’s last words were: ‘You’ve still got your socks on.’ Devoted: Lucie and Mark on their wedding day in 2006. Two years later she became an early widow. ‘Hardly the Humphrey Bogart of last words,’ remarks his widow. The circumstances of Mark’s sudden collapse read like a Gothic tragi-comedy, but, until then, his married life with Lucie had been idyllic. They fell in love at first sight in 2002, married in 2006 and, two years later, their daughter, ‘B’, was born. They lived in North Yorkshire, in a house specially chosen for its diminutive size — ‘Like Mr and Mrs Tickle, we liked to be able to reach out and touch each other’ — and Mark commuted to his job as a security analyst at GCHQ in Cheltenham. It was on a late summer’s day in 2008 that the first shadow fell over their perfect family. Unable to contact Mark by phone, Lucie rang GCHQ to find that he hadn’t turned up for work. Ten minutes later the hospital called. Mark had managed to summon an ambulance before collapsing with an aortic dissection — a tear in the wall of the artery carrying blood from the heart. ‘Is it life-threatening?’ Lucie asked. ‘I can’t answer “No” to that,’ the consultant replied. Three months later, and three stone lighter having suffered a stroke during open-heart surgery, Mark came home. ‘He’d been given a second chance and He was going to take it with both hands,’ Lucie writes. Four years on, that’s exactly what he was doing. They were visiting Lucie’s mum for her grandma’s funeral. The previous autumn, Lucie had suffered a miscarriage. Now, they were trying for another baby. ‘Those who become embroiled in the complicated world of conception know that there is a “moment” during the month at which all systems must absolutely go . . . this wasn’t going to be the Barry White of sessions. It was business . . . And besides, Take Me Out was starting in ten minutes, so we had to be quick.’ Lucie’s memoir, which started life as a very personal blog, is a raw howl of disbelief at the speed with which a baby-making quickie could turn to life-shattering tragedy. On the whole, society prefers widows to be dignified, composed and, as soon as decently possible after the funeral, invisible. Lucie was none of those. She held it together for long enough to give a magnificent, tearless eulogy at Mark’s funeral, after which she wept uncontrollably, replacing the lost fluid with gallons of red wine, occasionally varied with champagne or tequila. She raged at her mum. She blighted family gatherings with her inconsolable grief. She was unable even to function fully as a newly single parent. Lucie  was often at her wit's end but hers is a story of survival (posed by model) During evenings of ‘wine and late-night TV, interspersed with pangs of longing for my husband and my previous life . . . I would wake up, sometimes on the settee, but often in bed alongside my child, not remembering how either of us had got there.’ Most startlingly of all, a year after Mark’s death from catastrophic heart arrhythmia, Lucie embarked on a vigorous sexual relationship with a luridly tattooed local plumber — ‘With him, I felt I was immune to the curse of death by intercourse.’ Me After You is, despite everything, a story of survival and, cautiously, recovery. It is very funny about the grim trappings of sudden death, from sinisterly chirpy funeral directors to the horror of cancelling Mark’s insurance policies: ‘So your husband died, Lucie, yeah! Brilliant! OK, I’m gonna need to take some details . . .’ It certainly doesn’t draw a veil over the bad bits. One of the worst moments came when Lucie posted a link to her blog on a website for young widows where she had found comfort, only to be informed by the site’s founder that her diary was ‘moronic’ and that she was henceforth banned. The fact that her blog later won an award and is now published as a book must feel like a triumphant vindication. But the real triumph is that she survived, sustained by her own gritty strength, and with lots of help from her family, her little daughter, her endlessly understanding friends, and her new dog, Brucie, all of whom sound lovely. Two-and-a-half years on, with ‘a new house in a new place, with new friends and a new dog, and the potential of a new relationship’, Lucie still hasn’t been able to bring herself to decide what to do with Mark’s ashes. ‘He is still in His ornate, lacquered box at the bottom of my wardrobe.’ But she writes: ‘I believe that Mark would want us to be happy.’","Lucie Brownlee's husband collapsed and died while they were making love .

"By . Wills Robinson for MailOnline . A man who told his girlfriend he had been kidnapped as an excuse to stay out partying sparked an overnight man-hunt. The 32-year-old made his girlfriend believe he was being held hostage and that his 'kidnapper' would not let him return until he had paid a £50 debt. But he was actually enjoying himself at a house party in Bolton until the early hours of this morning after carrying on a  drinking session that began at a nearby pub. A 32-year-old man told his girlfriend he had been kidnapped so he could stay at a house party in Shurmer Street, Bolton, Greater Manchester, until the early hours of the morning . Detective Inspector Jo Clawson from Greater Manchester Police said it was 'without doubt one of the most foolish and irresponsible incidents I have been involved in'. The girlfriend who was 'beside herself' called police after speaking to his 'kidnapper' on the phone and receiving a number of text messages. More than a dozen officers began an urgent investigation, which included house to house enquiries, checking CCTV and analysing mobile phone data in a bid to find him. A number of houses were searched and a man arrested on suspicion of kidnap - but he was later released when he admitted it was a 'ruse' to allow his friend to stay out longer. Police then tracked down the time-waster at the party in Shurmer Street shortly before 1.30am. Detective Inspector Clawson added: 'The man's girlfriend was absolutely beside herself with worry and genuinely concerned that he would come to harm. 'Rightfully, based on what she knew at the time, the matter was reported to police. The culprit, who has not been named, was fined after sparking a man-hunt involving more than a dozen officers and detectives while he carried on with his drinking session . 'Considerable resources and time then went into finding this man, who it transpires made the entire thing up so he could stay out and party. 'This is without doubt one of the most foolish and irresponsible incidents I have been involved in. 'Significant resources were taken off the front line on a Friday night, which is without exception one of the busiest times of the week.' She added that he was 'fortunate' to not have been charged as officers decided not to waste more police resources and public money by putting him through the court system. Instead he was given a fixed penalty notice for wasting police time and the matter was recorded as a criminal conviction on his record.","The 32-year-old told his girlfriend he wouldn't be released unless he paid £50 .

"By . Josh Gardner for MailOnline . and Ap  Reporter . The National Basketball Association's first ever female union leader has given an ominous warning to any critics who may doubt her leadership skills based on her gender. While introducing herself to over 100 NBA players at a private meeting in Las Vegas last month, Michele Roberts used the opportunity make an impression on the athletes. And it was a strong one. 'My past,' she told the roomful of men whose million-dollar contracts she would soon represent, 'is littered with the bones of men who were foolish enough to think I was someone they could sleep on.' Formidable: Michele Roberts issued an ominous warning to anyone who may underestimate her abilities as the first female leader of a major North American sports union . The startling statement came after the high-power Washington attorney rattled off her considerable resume--UC Berkeley Law School, partner at a prestigious firm--but still sensed the gender question at the tip of everyone in the private meeting's tongues. 'I bet you can tell I'm a woman,' she said cooly, 'and I suspect the rest of the world can, too.' Soon after, she won 32 of 34 votes to clench her new position, reports the New York Times. It capped a long and arduous process to replace Billy Hunter, who was ousted in February 2013. Roberts was one of the finalists initially offered to the rank-and-file during All-Star weekend in February, but the process was re-opened under another search committee at the urging of some players and agents. More than 100 players reconvened in Las Vegas that week, and after some tense moments leading up to the vote, Roberts emerged as the winner. 'Obviously, I would've preferred that it happen sooner rather than later, but I completely understood when there were questions raised about the process,' Roberts said. 'Frankly, I would not have wanted them to ignore those questions and not affirmatively address those concerns. I wanted the job in February, but I wanted the job where there would be no questions about the fairness or the process, so I completely endorsed the executive committee to address these questions, and they did and now best I can tell they're very pleased.' Foe: New NBA Commissioner Adam Silver may be re-examining his expectations of after Roberts described her past as 'littered with the bones of men' who've underestimated her. He'll be one of her opponents at union negotiations . The players considered more than 300 candidates during their 17-month search before picking Roberts, who has been called the finest trial lawyer in Washington by 'Washingtonian Magazine.' She said her new job will feature straight, honest talk, just like she delivers to a jury, and the strategizing that made her such a successful lawyer. The search to replace Hunter, who led the NBPA from 1996 until a review of the union was critical of his business practices, leaves players with less than two years to prepare for the next potential collective bargaining talks. Either the union or the league can opt out of the current agreement in 2017. The union has struggled for years with in-fighting and a lack of organization, and the players took a significant cut in their guarantee of basketball-related income — 57 percent to about 50 percent, a drop of hundreds of millions annually in salary costs — in the contentious lockout in 2011. League revenues are on the rise, a new TV contract is set to be negotiated in 2016 and franchise valuations are skyrocketing. 'As far as I'm concerned, preparations for CBA negotiations started yesterday,' Roberts said. 'It's at the top of my list of things that I've been instructed to begin the process of preparing for, and sure it's a lot to do, but I've never been shy about hard work and long hours, so we'll get it done. We'll be ready.' NBA Commissioner Adam Silver congratulated Roberts in a statement, saying he looked forward to working with her 'to ensure the continued health and growth of our game.' 'The partnership between our players and teams is the backbone of the league, and we are eager to continue working with the Players Association to build this relationship,' Silver said. The fallout from the lockout and the Hunter ouster left the union reeling. But it also made Roberts want to get involved, which will bring the New York native back home. 'The more I thought about it,' she said, 'the more I thought that would be a great opportunity to do something really important.'","Washington power-player attorney Michele Roberts took the reigns of the NBC Players Association in July .

Paramedics took over when they arrived less than 10 minutes later - and spent around 40 minutes trying to bring the boy back to life before realising there was nothing they could do to save him. Investigators are working on the theory child fell into the pool after climbing up some stairs separating his home from the neighbour’s and clambering onto the roof of a garage thought to be above the water. The child was discovered around 10.45am on Monday in an affluent area of Mijas Costa known as El Coto. The boy’s family rented the top part of a villa owned by their landlord Fernando Aguilar.

"By . Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . With wheelbarrows, a lawn mower and an abundance of plants and shrubbery, it certainly ticks all the boxes for the average garden. But with its huge collection of quirky ornaments and life-size scarecrows, which fill the 40ft by 30ft space to the brim, this front lawn gives landscape gardening  a whole new meaning. The award-winning oasis, which is nestled in the heart of Caol - the largest village in Scotland - is the result of eight years of hard work by 64-year-old grandfather Robert Rae. Grandfather Robert Rae, 64, has spent the last eight years transforming the front garden of his council house in Caol, which is the largest village in Scotland . The keen gardener and grandfather-of-six took up the hobby after being forced to give up work as a telephone box cleaner following a heart attack about eight years ago . After plenty of hard work and graft, his front lawn now has more than 1,000 ornaments including a year-round Santa, Snow White and Seven Dwarfs and a scarecrows . Mr Rae said many of the ornaments and features of the incredible garden have been bought for him as gifts by his four children and six grandchildren . He has spent much of the last decade transforming the garden of his council house as part of a project to keep him busy after being forced to give up work as a telephone box cleaner following a heart attack. Mr Rae initially took up gardening to pass the time and help with his recuperation but it soon turned into a full-time hobby. His first addition to his front lawn was a stone garden ornament of a motorbike with a rider. He later added a few more bits and pieces and it wasn't long before his four children and six grandchildren also started buying goods to add to his collection. The garden is now choc-a-block and Mr Rae said there's so many different ornaments that he's lost count of how many different features he has in it. 'It's probably around a thousand but I can't be sure. It could be more than that,' he said. From mannequins complete with sunglasses and wigs, to figurines, ornaments, dolls and gnomes, the garden features everything imaginable. As well as a year-round Santa on display and the children's favourite of a Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, it also has boasts a white ornamental tiger, life-size ornamental cats and dogs and replicas of every type of farmyard animal you can imagine. The 40ft by 30ft space is full to the brim of quirky ornaments  and gives landscape gardening a whole new meaning. He now attracts visitors from around the country . Mr Rae has even been forced to install CCTV cameras to keep watch over his garden after vandals broke in one night and damaged some his hard work . The 64-year-old initially took up gardening as a hobby to pass the time and recuperate following his heart attack but it has now turned into a full-time job . He's even managed to fill it with a mini lighthouse, an old bike, an old wheelbarrow – which he retrieved from dump – an ancient pram complete with a doll of a baby, a few chimneys and a clutch of clocks. Fairy lights have been strung up around the edge of the garden and solar lights and panels also help to add to the magical nighttime experience which sees it light up much of the estate. All of the quirky ornaments sit on a lawn of artificial grass, but real goldfish and tadpoles can be found swimming around in his pond. He's also got a riot of real flowers growing in pots and hanging baskets which are scattered throughout the garden. He said: 'It gives me something to do. I never thought it would end up like this when I started but the village children enjoy it. There's still room for more.' His wife Margaret added: 'He really loves his garden. I think it's what keeps him going. He says he does it for the kids but I'm not so sure.' Mr Rae said of his passion: 'It gives me something to do. I never thought it would end up like this when I started but the children enjoy it. There's still room for more' His wife Margaret said fondly: 'He really loves his garden. I think it's what keeps him going. He says he does it for the kids but I'm not so sure' Mr Rae has won numerous competitions for his beloved garden over the last couple of years including Best Ornamental Garden in 2009 and Best Easy Care Garden . Visitors from all over the country flock to the council estate to see Mr Rae's garden, with many spending hours marveling at his creations and taking pictures of the site . His daughter Doreen, 42, has helped contribute ornaments to the garden - which has become an enjoyment for the whole family. She said: 'Everywhere we go we bring him something back for the garden. Every anniversary, every birthday, every Christmas we buy something for him. 'Everyone in the family does. It's really mounted up but dad thinks it' s great. He spends a lot of time and effort on it and he's very proud that ""Caol In Bloom"" have presented him with awards for the garden. 'In 2009 he won Best Ornamental Garden, the following year he got Best Easy Care Garden and then in 2011, 2012 and 2013 he was commended. So he's done very well.' While visitors initially flocked to the garden at Christmas to see it lit up like a fairyground with an abundance of festivities, tourists have now started to visit all-year round to marvel at his creation. From teddy bears and lifesize ceramic dogs to baby dolls and homemade scarecrows, the front garden features a wide range of quirky and unusual items . Despite laying artificial grass on the lawn, Mr Rae has filled his pots and hanging baskets with real flowers which he tends to on a regular basis to ensure they stay fresh . However, the increased number of  visitors arriving to take pictures of the incredible site has also brought increased problems for Mr Rae. The garden was recently vandalised in the middle of the night and the grandfather has now been forced to install a CCTV system to watch over his pride and joy. He said: 'It was vandalised. The police advised me to get the surveillance cameras and we've had no more trouble'. His wife added: 'Someone came in the night and moved nearly everything. It was all out down along the middle of the street. Can you imagine anyone going to all that trouble? We could hardly believe our eyes when we looked out in the morning.'","Robert Rae, 64, has spent the last eight years transforming the front garden of his council house in Caol, Scotland .

"By . Sanchez Manning for The Mail on Sunday . The Mail on Sunday is today offering a £5,000 reward to help catch a man suspected of savagely attacking a father of four in his own home. Oskar Pawlowichz, 29, is wanted in connection with an attempted burglary in which four masked men forced their way into Paul Kohler’s £2 million home in Wimbledon, South-West London. Three other men have already been arrested over the incident which left the Cambridge–educated law lecturer fearing he would lose his sight.

"By . Linda Mcdougall . Angry: Austin Mitchell with his wife Linda . It's been a bad week for me and my husband, Austin Mitchell, the Labour MP for Grimsby. He’s been bullied and abused by his colleagues in his own party for daring to discuss the future of all-women shortlists. ‘Sexist and misogynistic,’ said Lucy Powell, Shadow Children’s Minister. ‘It’s the old, cloth-eared, macho politics,’ growled Labour aristocrat Dame Tessa Jowell. And Hull East Labour MP Karl Turner joined the ladies, describing his neighbour and colleague as ‘self-serving, chauvinistic, antiquated’. Austin has been battered all over the media since his article in last week’s Mail on Sunday where he gave his views on selecting many Labour candidates for next year’s Election from all-women shortlists (AWS). Shadow Attorney General Emily Thornberry MP weighed in with ‘suspect his wife Linda is not amused either, is she?’. You’re right, Emily. I’m not. I have, for as long as I can remember, been a feminist. And I have, from their inception before the 1997 Election, been an enthusiastic supporter of AWS. Of the 120 women who became MPs in 1997, 101 were Labour. They changed the face of Westminster for ever. I was so thrilled I wrote a book, Westminster Women. However, there have been some disturbing trends of late: seats where only one or two women applied, seats fixed in advance for favoured daughters. AWS should not become the ‘old boy network’ in a skirt. Most concerning of all, it appears to have become untouchable. Any suggestion of change or modification is howled down and treated with derision. Austin wrote a perfectly sensible piece exploring the possibilities for an end to AWS. He was neither hysterical nor misogynist. He said many things I would wholeheartedly support (albeit in less careful language than I’d have used). For this he has been utterly vilified. The Labour Twitterati got their teeth in and held on all week: ‘I cannot wait till your generation finally dies,’ screamed one. Austin was determined to stand down before the 2015 Election. He’d had serious heart problems in 2013, and it would have been hard to go on with his 80th birthday coming up. There had been speculation of an AWS in Grimsby since January when Melanie Onn was rumoured to be set to become Labour’s prospective Parliamentary candidate. We began to be worried about the process: was it predestination or a fair choice? Austin had seen Ed Miliband and the Chief Whip Rosie Winterton several times to discuss the timing of his announcement. Anna Yearley, Ed’s political fixer, was always at the meetings. Austin says she gently explained to him, as she would to any out-of-touch geriatric, that AWS was for the good of the party, not Grimsby. From then on it unfolded like a plan imposed from above. Melanie Onn’s name was floated by the leadership as The Chosen One. Few women applied. A month before polling day it looked as though there might be only two: Melanie and a local councillor. Dozens had applied to be the MP for Grimsby in 1977 when Austin had been selected. Women want seats that are convenient to get home to. You can’t say that about Grimsby. Female politicians often have needs and responsibilities not experienced by most men. Whatever the Labour sisterhood might tell you, in the real world, women, including politicians, still do most of the childcare and want to spend time with their kids during the working week. A constituency nearer London or on a direct train route gives them a better chance of doing that. By the time AWS was announced in Grimsby, Melanie had a strong foothold in the local party and was ready to roll, strongly supported by the Unison union. Austin made it clear he would take no part in the selection, but I felt there should be no such inhibition for me. So I set out to find some good strong women who might be interested. I spoke to several, but could persuade none. Grimsby was too far, too off the beaten track. Nearly all had childcare responsibilities as well as their careers as politicians. Others had heard Grimsby had been ‘stitched up’ for Melanie. Only Katie Ghose, chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, bravely decided to give it a go. An experienced campaigner and terrific candidate, she ran Melanie close, winning the first round of an exhaustive ballot, but losing in the end by a handful of votes. It was a view widely held locally that Melanie had been gifted the seat. The way the Leader’s Office acted, and strong union support gave her a head start. She had more, better, earlier, glossier leaflets, and she was a local party worker, born in the constituency. All the other candidates started behind, and stayed there. Stella Creasy MP, pictured left, went head-to-head on the issue with Mr Mitchell on Newsnight, which was presented by Kirsty Wark, pictured right . That was the atmosphere in which Austin wrote his piece for The Mail on Sunday. The jihad sisters who’d decided it was best to keep the old boy out of the process until Melanie was safely selected, rose up as one to abuse him. Of course they never bothered to read what he actually wrote. The name Austin Mitchell and AWS in the same sentence was all it needed. Like trained guerilla fighters, they went for him with both barrels and chucked in a couple of hand grenades and a shoulder-launched missile for good measure. Then the BBC’s Newsnight picked up the baton and handed it to Stella Creasy MP. Stella and Newsnight’s Kirsty Wark were in the studio in London. Austin was in the BBC news room in Leeds perched on a stool in front of a monitor which showed him only a picture of himself or a newsfeed of events in Gaza. He remained there for 45 minutes. Austin is at the best of times fairly deaf, an advantage in politics but not on Newsnight. He couldn’t see what was going on and he heard little. Stella had decided that the way to win was to interrupt Austin if he even opened his mouth. This she did very successfully. It looked hilarious: two women talking urgently among themselves while a bewildered older man appeared above and between them in what seemed to be a glass box. He was looking puzzled and holding up his hands in a ‘don’t shoot me’ kind of way. When women finally do take over the world, I imagine scenes like this will be commonplace. I’m still an enthusiastic supporter of AWS. But I am deeply disappointed that the women at the top of the Labour Party think it is perfectly OK to ‘diss’ an old and long-serving male MP just to demonstrate how tough they are.","Labour MP for Grimsby explored possibility of end of all-women shortlists .

"By . Stephanie Linning for MailOnline . Great-grandmother Valerie Pritchard, 72, drowned after she accidentally hit the accelerator instead of the brake while driving near Manchester Ship Canal . A great-grandmother drowned after she accidentally hit the accelerator instead of the brake and drove into a canal. Valerie Pritchard, 72, was found trapped inside her car at the bottom of the Manchester Ship Canal in Warrington, Cheshire, after she 'lost control' of the vehicle in March. Just days before the accident, Mrs Pritchard had spoken to her daughter about switching her manual car for an automatic as pressing down on the pedal was causing her back pain. Her heartbroken family praised two men who ‘risked their own lives trying to save hers’ by jumping into the freezing water just moments after the fatal accident. The grandmother-of-four, from Grappenhall, Warrington, Cheshire, died after she accidentally pressed the accelerator, causing the vehicle to shoot forward into the canal near to the junction of Egerton Street and Ellesmere Road in Stockton Heath, Warrington, on 12 March. Alan Moore, assistant coroner for Cheshire, yesterday called her death an ‘unfortunate and tragic accident’. Expert evidence at the inquest at Warrington Coroner's Court revealed that the car she was driving was in a serviceable condition. The inquest heard that Mrs Pritchard, who had been driving for around 30 years, was fit for her age and had no medical history of seizures, fits or cramps to her legs, which could have caused her to faint at the wheel. A post-mortem examination also revealed that there was no indication that she had suffered from a sudden heart problem while she was driving. In the hours leading up to the fatal accident, Mrs Pritchard was described as being her ‘usual happy self’ and had bumped into a friend, Alison Addison, at around 3.45pm. Mrs Addison recalled that she had made her laugh as she joked that she hoped her next physiotherapist would be a ‘hunky rugby player’. But around 15 minutes later, Mrs Pritchard ‘lost control of her car’ while driving down Egerton Street and drove straight into the canal, where minutes later it was submerged under water.

"By . Martin Robinson for MailOnline . Travellers have been accused of creating a 'Grand Canyon' of rubbish  after dumping two tonnes of waste on playing fields in revenge for being moved on. The group allegedly went door-to-door collecting doors, toilets, furniture, and rubble before leaving mountains of mess on Ashburton Playing Fields in Croydon. Croydon Council had them evicted last week after they set up an illegal camp there - so in response to the court order the travellers appear to have dumped the commercial and domestic waste. Taxpayers will be left with a bill of at least £15,000 to clear up the mess. Disgusting: Travellers have been blamed for dumping two tonnes of waste on playing fields after they were evicted from some public playing fields . Allegations: The group went door to door to collect whatever items they could get from homes and businesses after Croydon Council had them removed . Mess: The local council say the clear-up will cost at least £15,000 and every penny will have to be covered by the taxpayer . Andrew Chesham, 32, who uses the playing field to walk his dog told the Standard: 'I cannot believe the mess is still there. I’ve never seen anything dumped on this scale before. 'There’s everything from broken toilets to piles of office furniture all dumped in big mounds. It’s like the Grand Canyon of rubbish and mess that you can walk through'. Andy Bloss, 25, who also walks his dogs there told the Croydon Advertiser: 'I am angry as after all this is where I live and it is being vandalized . This is not the first time this happened. 'It happens a few times every year, not just in the park but also in the woods opposite. 'They stay, dump their rubbish, then go. They have no regard for residents and the many families who live in the area'. Tough job: A worker uses a rake to try to clear the mess as a JCB digger is used to lift the larger items dumped . Vast: People who use the playing fields have said that they have never seen anything like the mess left . Detritus: Doors, toilets, furniture, commecial waste and rubble has been dumped on Ashburton Playing Fields . Hard work: Croydon council promises to remove fly-tipped waste in 48 hours but this could take longer . How it should look: Ashburton Playing Fields is a much loved community resource that was taken over by travellers several weeks ago . The local council launched its 'Don't Mess with Croydon' campaign in May and promised all fly tipping would be removed within 48 hours - but the travellers' waste has been there since last week. A spokesman said: 'The cost of clearing the fly-tip from Ashburton Park is £15,000, a cost that is borne by Croydon's council taxpayers. The council is determined to stamp out this criminal activity and will prosecute any fly-tippers that dump their rubbish on borough roads. 'We are aware of the fly-tipping in Ashburton Park and are in the process of removing it. 'We will also be seeking to prosecute those responsible.'","The group allegedly went door-to-door collecting waste from homes and businesses before dumping two tonnes of it .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan for MailOnline . If you think you know what a rainbow looks like, think again - this series of amazing images shows the moment upside-down rainbows were spotted in the sky. The extremely rare weather phenomenon was seen in the blue sky above Blackpool recently. Known as circumzenithal arcs, the spectacle occurs when sunlight bounces off ice crystals high in the atmosphere, sending the light rays back up and bending the sunlight into a band of colours. Web designer Ian Brookes has spotted a rare instance of circumzenithal arcs, or upside-down rainbows, in the UK. The photo above shows one of the snaps he took above Blackpool. The rare phenomenon is usually only seen near the North and South poles . Web designer Ian Brookes saw the rainbow shining down at him last month and rushed to get his camera to capture the bizarre spectacle. Rather than being caused by raindrops like normal rainbows, upside-down rainbows are the result of freak atmospheric conditions, rarely seen outside the North and South Poles. Meteorologists say the clouds must be convex to the sun, with the ice particles lined up together in the right direction, to refract the light. This results in the sunlight bouncing off the ice crystals high in the atmosphere, sending the light rays back up and bending the sunlight like a glass prism into a spectrum of colour. The arc is generally only seen in the artic circle - and this is one of just a handful of instances where the arc has been spotted in the UK. The 'rainbow'' is also much brighter and more concentrated than a rainfall rainbow. Rainbows are formed when sunlight is refracted in a raindrop. But in a circumzenithal arc, the colours are in reverse order from a rainbow, with violet on the top and red at the bottom. The arc usually vanishes quickly because the cirrus clouds containing the ice crystals shift their position. Mr Brookes, 43, said: 'I’ve never seen anything like it before but there it was - directly upwards in the sky from my back garden. 'It was a very sunny evening, a blue sky with only a few tiny bits of white cloud, but you couldn’t miss the rainbow. 'I was amazed, and my wife and daughter couldn’t believe their eyes. They thought it was simply wonderful.' Upside-down rainbows are usually found in the North and South Poles and are formed when light shines through tiny ice crystals in the clouds. The arc only appears when the sunlight catches a specific angle through thin clouds at a heights of around 25,000ft (7,600m). Because of the altitude, the clouds are made of tiny ice crystals, unlike traditional rainbows that form due to reflection and refraction of light in water droplets. And unlike an ordinary rainbow, the sky has to be clear of rain and low level clouds for a circumzenithal arc to be seen. The colours in a circumzenithal arc are also in reverse order from a rainbow, with violet on the top and red at the bottom. 'Upside-down rainbows or circumzenithal arcs are an example of a halo,' Charles Powell, a Forecaster for the Met Office, tells MailOnline. 'Similar to a rainbow, a halo is formed when light is reflected by ice crystals (instead of water droplets). 'If the light rays strike the ice crystals at a particular angle the light is refracted which gives a slight colouration. 'The ideal angle is 46° and typically only part of the halo forms, appearing like an arc convex to the sun, hence the upside down perspective.' The amazing photos show a rainbow that appears to be the wrong way up. Upside-down rainbows form when sunlight reflects off ice crystals in cloudsat high altitude. Meteorologists say the clouds must be convex to the sun, with the ice particles lined up together in the right direction, to refract the light .

Mr Brookes’ spot is one of only a handful of occasions where this phenomenon has been captured in the UK. He used a Canon 6D DSLR to capture the extraordinary moment. Mr Brookes added: 'It was only there for about five minutes before it started to fade so I rushed inside the house to grab my camera so I could catch it. 'It was truly unbelievable.' A spokesman for the Met Office added: 'It is quite rare to see an arc as clearly as this in the UK. Visibility of these arcs can vary greatly with someone ten miles away not being able to see it.'","Web designer Ian Brookes spotted the phenomenom above Blackpool .

"By . Lucy Crossley for MailOnline . This is the squalid home where malnourished children infested with headlice lived in squalor because their parents were able to 'play the authorities off against one another'. Teachers, doctors, health professionals and social workers in Gloucestershire were all aware of the family but no formal action was taken until one of the children was admitted to hospital with severe nappy rash. Now a serious case review has found there were five 'missed opportunities' by the authorities to intervene with the family earlier because neglect was not treated as seriously as other forms of abuse. Squalor: Police have released this picture where malnourished children lived in squalor and surrounded by animal waste because their parents were able to play the authorities off one another . The family had been known to authorities for 16 years with teachers, doctors, health professionals and social workers all in contact with them. During that time there were numerous visits to GPs and complaints from teachers and health workers to social services about the state of the children, who like their parents can not be named for legal reasons. They were found to be suffering with tooth decay, head lice, poor growth and weight gain, delayed development, anaemia, poor hygiene and severe nappy rash. Concerns were also raised over missed health appointments, failures to immunise the children, failures to use prescribed medication, poor school attendance and non-compliance with health professionals. The review, which was commissioned by the county’s safeguarding children board, said there were 127 recorded contacts made between the family and primary health care professionals over a 27-month period. Over the years there were numerous notes made about the condition of their home - with it being dirty, untidy and smelling of faeces. Danger: An open plug socket that was hanging from the wall of a house of the couple who were jailed for neglecting five of their children . The review found there was ongoing evidence that the parents often turned away health professionals from their home and the mother prioritised her own needs over the children. Even the children’s grandmother admitted her daughter was 'manipulative and aggressive' and very controlling. GPs noted she was 'skilled at playing off one agency against the other'. The serious case review said the parents successfully avoided health and medical professionals, meaning the children were subjected to further neglect and harm. 'One of the most concerning issues in this case is the apparent lack of understanding, at the time, of neglect and its impact by a number of the key professionals working with this family,' the report said. 'All of the signs were there, and had been for many years, that these children were suffering or likely to suffer significant harm due to neglect. Overgrown: Ivy creeps into one of the bedrooms of the house. A serious case review has found there were five 'missed opportunities' by the authorities to intervene with the family earlier . 'At the time there were clear difficulties in ensuring that all of the information on all of the children was available to be considered and drawn together in order to ensure a complete picture. 'A child protection conference would have allowed all the professionals involved to share the history of the family and the current concerns in a setting chaired by an independent person, where the parents could not have decided who was involved and who was not.' A police investigation was launched after one child was admitted to hospital in November last year with severe nappy rash. The children’s parents were jailed at Gloucester Crown Court after neglecting five of their children between 2007 and 2012. They had admitted five counts of neglect of the children. The mother was jailed for two years and nine months, while her husband received a two-year prison term. The children were removed from the parents prior to their sentences being imposed, with some placed with foster carers and others with family members. The serious case review made a series of recommendations to the authorities in the county. David McCallum, chair of Gloucestershire Safeguarding Children Board, said the authorities involved had underestimated the impact of long-term neglect. 'There was really long-term, chronic and serious neglect,' he said. 'For most of the time when children’s social care and other agencies were working with this family, they treated the neglect as a ""child in need"" issue and that probably underestimated the extent of the harm those children were suffering. 'One of the real points of learning for all the organisations involved is that neglect can be really, really harmful to children, especially when it’s long-term.' Mr McCallum said this type of case could happen again 'because neglect is a really challenging area of work', and cited the death of Victoria Climbie, who was tortured and murdered by her guardians in 2000. 'Another factor present in this case, to be frank, the parents were concealing the neglect the children were suffering,' he said. 'I have worked in safeguarding for many years and if you go back to Victoria Climbie and before that, these are some of the most difficult issues all the time and we need that constant, relentless focus on, if we are going to avoid this happening in the future.'","Teachers, doctors and social workers were all aware of the family .

"By . Simon Tomlinson for MailOnline . A suspected Islamic State militant taken prisoner in Iraq has protested his innocence despite video showing him at an ISIS rally after the capture of a major city. Alozat Abbas is one of three alleged jihadist fighters captured by Kurdish peshmerga forces who have clawed by territory with the help of U.S. air strikes. The 22-year-old insists his arrest was a mistake, saying he never supported ISIS and was tortured into confessing, according to Sky News which gained access to the prisoners at a secret location. But he doesn't deny taking part in an ISIS gathering after the capture of Mosul in June, where he is seen holding an AK-47 aloft with an ammunition belt wrapped around his Barcelona football shirt.

'It's a mistake': Suspected Islamic State militant Alozat Abbas (centre) is seen holding an AK-47 aloft with an ammunition belt wrapped around his Barcelona football shirt at an ISIS rally after the capture of Mosul in June . He is the only one of dozens of armed fighters who have not covered their face and he shows no sign of being coerced. Abbas said he realised his mistake in revealing his identity, but claims he couldn't run because the extremist group threatened to kill him. He told Sky News: 'It's one way - if you go you can't come back again. 'They were threatening us - we were afraid'. 'Tortured into a confession': Abbas professes his innocence after being captured by Kurdish peshmerga forces who identified him from the footage of the rally because he had not covered his face . He was identified from the video by Kurdish forces and later arrested, still in his Barcelona shirt, which had the name of striker Neymar on the back. Another of the prisoners, Omer Hassan, 19, claims he was also tortured. 'They tied my hands for seven days behind my back and beat me and kicked me,' he added. All three claim they have never shot anyone and were simply rebelling against former Iraqi prime minister Nouri al-Maliki.

"By . Martin Robinson for MailOnline . A Polish minibus driver accused of mowing down and killing a cyclist at 50mph was looking at photos of vintage sports cars on his mobile phone moments before the crash, a court heard today. Andrzej Wojcicki, 44, is accused of causing the death of Owain Richard James, 30, who was knocked down and killed on the A472 at Newbridge, South Wales last July. Mr James suffered severe head injuries in the crash and never regained consciousness. Cardiff Crown Court heard how police found photos Wojcicki, from Swansea, South Wales, had taken photos of vintage sports cars while driving, less than half a mile from the crash scene. On trial: Andrzej Wojcicki, 44, is accused of looking at photos on his phone before he caused the death of Owain Richard James, 30, who was knocked down and killed on the A472 at Newbridge, South Wales last July . The jury also heard how Wojcicki failed to stop for a 'considerable distance' and 'behaved strangely' by taking photographs of the scene immediately after the crash. He denies causing Mr James' death by dangerous driving. Prosecutor Nicholas Gareth Jones told the jury: 'He was looking at photographs he'd just taken rather than concentrating on his driving. 'To drive in that way, not see a cyclist that was visible for a long distance ahead of the vehicle, is clearly dangerous. 'The defendant was in the near side lane of the dual carriageway. The cyclist was riding inside a white rumble strip on the left hand side of the road. 'The prosecution believe the driver never saw the cyclist at all because he was distracted until after he collided with him. 'He may not have even realised he had collided with the cyclist immediately because he didn't stop for some considerable distance after the collision. 'The left side of the minibus hit the cyclist from behind. He suffered very severe injuries and he never regained consciousness.' Tragedy: Mr Harris was knocked down and killed on the A472 at Newbridge in South Wales last July . Case: Wojcicki, originally from Poland, 'behaved very strangely' and had been taking photos of the scene where Mr Harris died, Cardiff Crown Court, pictured, heard . Wojcicki, originally from Poland, was driving a left-hand drive minibus with his wife as a front seat passenger along the dual carriageway with Mr James cycling ahead of him. Following the collision, Mr Jones said the 'defendant behaved very strangely and started taking photographs of the scene.' He added that Wojcicki told witnesses at the scene that he had not seen the cyclist but later told police that the cyclist had swerved into his path.. Witness Matthew Smallman of Abersychan, who was driving behind the minibus, said: 'As we were progressing near to the cyclist, I left enough room, I was waiting for the white minibus to indicate right and go from the slow lane to the fast lane and give the cyclist the room that was required. 'The minibus was getting closer and closer to the cyclist was coming up to 15 to 20 yards. I thought then the minibus was just going to swerve out. 'The minibus didn't alter his course whatsoever, no break lights. The minibus ploughed into the cyclist.' Mr Smallman said he followed the minibus until it stopped to get the registration because other drivers had stopped to care for Mr James. The trial continues.

"By . Damien Gayle for MailOnline . Peeping Toms who ogle women in their most-intimate bathroom moments need no longer worry about the consequences in the hereafter - at least, according to one surprising spiritual authority. A hardline Islamic preacher from Egypt this week made waves in the Middle East after he issued a religious edict allowing a man to watch a woman 'while she is showering'. But there is a catch, which is that such voyeurism is only acceptable 'as long as your intentions are pure'. Go . forth and ogle! Egyptian cleric Usama al-Qawsi has controversially . ruled that it's alright by Allah for men to spy on women who are taking a . shower - as long as they intend to marry her at some point later . What are you doing up there? Peeping Toms can secretly watch women in the shower, as long as they do their ogling with 'pure' intentions . Salafist preacher Usama al-Qawsi made the controversial fatwa in a recent sermon. His opinion, based on his own, apparently rather special, interpretation of Islam, is that men can 'hide' somewhere 'in secret' in order to see parts of your intended bride 'she wouldn't usually let you see'. The edict appears to run counter to traditional Muslim teachings, which encourage both men and women dress modestly and 'lower their gaze' when faced with members of the opposite sex. Mr Qawsi's sermon was broadcast on Egyptian-based Mehwar TV Channel, and they have been translated into English by al-Arabiya. He is a representative of the Salafi movement, a minority strain in Egyptian Islam, which encourages believers to look back to the earliest Muslims as the epitome of good religious practice. He said: 'If you were really honest and wanted to marry that woman, and you were able to hide and watch her in secret, see the things that she wouldn’t usually let you see before marrying her, then it is acceptable as long as your intentions are pure. 'One of the Prophet’s companions did that. Some disapproved and told him: ""How do you do that when you’re one of the Prophet’s companions?"" Fatwa: His opinion, based on his own, apparently rather special, interpretation of Islam, is that men can 'hide' somewhere 'in secret' in order to see parts of your intended bride 'she wouldn't usually let you see' 'The Prophet answered: ""If you can see something that would make you want to marry her then go ahead and do it.""' Egypt's Minister of Religion, Mohammad Mukhtar, moved quickly to reject the fatwa. 'Where is the glory and masculinity in watching a woman shower?' he was quoted as saying by Al Bawaba, a Jordan-based English-language news network. 'Would you allow this to happen to your daughter? If it was OK with you then it isn’t with the conservative, civilized Muslim and Christian societies – they disapprove of it. 'Besides, Islam preaches that modesty should be in our nature and all religions concur.'","Salafist preacher Usama al-Qawsi offers surprising fatwa during sermon .

"By . Freya Noble for Daily Mail Australia . Imagine riding more than 30 different horses across a treacherous path that stretches more than 1000 kilometres across the Mongolian wilderness on a trip that lasts nearly a fortnight. Each year, more than 30 people from around the world do just that when they take part in the Mongol Derby - the longest and toughest horse race in the world - and this year, for the first time ever, an Australian woman beat all of fierce the competition to come in first place. This week Sam Jones, from Western Australia, became the second woman and first Australian to complete the race in the fastest time since its inception in 2009. Scroll down for video . Sam Jones is the first Australian to win the Mongol Derby as well as the second woman and first Australian to complete the race in the fastest time since its inception in 2009 . The 40-year-old escaped without a scratch on her - unlike some of her fellow competitors some of whom had to be airlifted out of the race while others were hospitalised . 'It was the most exhilarating, invigorating experience of my life', Ms Jones told Daily Mail Australia. 'I did not go in to this thinking I'm going to win this - the first priority is to survive it and not come home with a permanent injury.' The 40-year-old escaped without a scratch on her, unlike some of her fellow competitors, some of whom had to be airlifted out of the race while others were hospitalised. Each year only about 30 percent of riders finish, but Ms Jones said nearly 60 percent of her fellow competitors got across the line this year. The derby is run by British Firm The Adventurists, and the path changes every year. Riders navigate between 25 stations refueling and changing horses and is based on the long-distance postal system implemented in the area back in the 1200s. The whole journey is demanding physically, but also mentally as competitors have to navigate their way between stations and eventually to the finish line. They can stay with local herders along the way or sleep under the stars with their steeds. 'Winning it was amazing, but I was almost sad to cross the finish line, I wanted to keep going, I didn't want it to end!' Ms Jones revealed. While some competitors stuck together during the race, the West Australian woman completed the bulk of the 1000 kilometres on her own and said she managed her horses better this way. Each rider works their way through around 30 different horses, who are much tougher than any of the animals Ms Jones is used to riding back home. 'The horses are the star of the show there, they're so incredibly tough.' 'It's incredible what they can cope with... They galloped over ground I would have hesitated to walk over,' she said. Riders track between 25 stations to change to ride as many as 30 horses and refuel throughout 10 days . More than 30 people from around the world take part every year - but less than 50 per cent finish actually finish the treacherous race . The race is held every August in the vast Mongolian wilderness stretching more than 1000 kilometres . As a whole, Ms Jones said the experience was unlike anything she'd every been through in her life, and has signed up to take on the derby every 10 years. She said she would love to do it more often, but the hefty price tag is a bit of a deterrent. 'The entry fees are about $14,000 but when you consider what they provide and every ride needs 30 horses each ... It pays for the horses, all the people to look after them, all the people to look after those people, the vets, the medics.' Ms Jones also revealed the incredible bonds that were forged between fellow riders over a relatively short time - just 10 days - and said she's made friends for life. She also told of the incredible strength of her fellow competitors, and the real danger the race can present. 'There was a lady who turned 61 on the last day of the race and she rode with the leaders most of the time but took two very heavy falls... The horses bucked her off. 'I might have won, but there were others who did far more amazing things,' Ms Jones said. The path changes every year and is based on the long-distance postal system implemented in the area back in the 1200s . The whole journey is demanding physically, but also mentally as competitors have to navigate their way between stations and eventually to the finish line .

"By . Caroline Mcguire for MailOnline . With a fashionista for a wife, David Cameron has no excuse for dodgy holiday gear. But the Prime Minister has managed to fail again with his non-work wardrobe - showcasing a pair of dusty old brown sandals on his annual trip to Cornwall. The 47-year-old must've been reading up on his holiday trends, because pool sliders are one of the hottest trends of 2014, but Mr Cameron's effort seemed like they were more likely to have come from 1814. David Cameron enjoys a coffee at the Surfside Cafe in Polzeath, with his wife Samantha seemingly unaware of the fashion disaster lurking underneath their table . His wife Samantha seemed oblivious of the horrors lurking under their bistro table as they enjoyed a cappuccino at the Surfside Cafe in Polzeath this afternoon. Indeed, the PM should have asked the ambassador for the British Fashion Council for some style advice before he packed his suitcase for the seaside trip. Samantha, who won the British Glamour Magazine Award for Best Accessory Designer in 2009, rounded off her own outfit with a simple, yet stylish pair of flip flops. It isn't the first time the PM has attempted the trend either - he first showcased the unfortunate footwear on a holiday in Ibiza last year. He should have learnt by now: David Cameron first wore his sliders on a trip to Ibiza with the family in 2013 . MailOnline Fashion Expert Toni Jones said: 'When you live in a suit dressing down can be tricky and we know that the art of 'smart casual' doesn't come easily to David Cameron, but there's no excuse for shoes like this. 'His wife Samantha is revered for her style, but it's obvious from these pictures that she has given up trying to guide her spouse's sartorial decisions. 'This style of open-toed shoe - known as the slide - is actually the height of beach chic for 2014 when worn with a nod to sports luxe. 'But these battered old slip-ons scream 'comfort' not cool. 'Mr Cameron obviously has bigger things to worry about than his footwear collection, but if he is interested in stepping his summer style up a level for his next break then I would suggest a pair of simple espadrilles, or if he's determined to feel the sun on his toes then a new pair of Birkenstocks is a cooler way to beat the heat.' On a trip to Portugal last month, David Cameron, pictured here in an Algarve fish market with wife Samantha, was much more successful with his choice of shoes - these stylish beige loafers . Mr Cameron has been far more successful in recent months with his choice of weekend wear. A pair of stylish beige loafers from Aldo hit the right note as part of his holiday suitcase on a family holiday to Portugal last month. And he doesn't usually have any trouble with his office attire, typically managing to look much smarter than most politicians  while busy with the day job. Mr Cameron, pictured here at the  Relationships Alliance Summit 2014, always manages to look extremely smart when on official business as the British Prime Minister . But the Conservative party leader has made the headlines for his terrible taste in the past. In 2011, he racked up thousands of column inches when he wore a pair of smart black leather loafers without socks on a family trip to Tuscany. Fashion critics across the country cringed at the PM's hot feet squeezed into the uncomfortable office shoes in sweltering Mediterranean temperatures. Mr Cameron has also come in for some ribbing from clothes-lovers for his tendency to rely on his trusty blue polo shirts while on away breaks. The collared T-shirts have made regular appearances on family holidays regardless of location, from the south west of England to the White Isle. Although on recent trips, he has been adding some variation with a series of new button-down short-sleeved linen shirts, nonetheless blue in colour. Mr Cameron wears one of his favourite blue polo shirts to join his wife Samantha on Harlyn Bay beach near Padstow, Cornwall on their 2008 holiday . In 2013, Mr Cameron wears a newer-looking blue polo shirt for yet another holiday to Cornwall with wife Samntha, this time to Polzeath in the north of the county . Last year he admitted that he struggled with his fashion choices. He said: 'I know so little about fashion that the two things I have been on the fashion pages for are not wearing socks with black shoes while on holiday — sorry about that — and attending a banquet at the Guildhall, where in full white tie my shirt separated, and there was a rather embarrassing picture. 'I am obviously not a great exemplar of fashion. 'When I go shopping my wife doesn’t allow me to look around the store at all, I am put in a changing room and things are passed to me like you would pass food to a prisoner.'","Mr Cameron catches attention for the wrong reason with his holiday sandals .

"By . Martin Robinson for MailOnline . 'Willy Wonka': Rolf Harris has been handing out Mars Bars to inmates who play dominoes with him . Rolf Harris has been given the nickname Willy Wonka by fellow inmates because he hands out Mars Bars  to people who play games with him. The 84-year-old paedophile is giving away chocolate during  dominoes matches - but is getting a reputation as a 'soft touch' with prisoners at HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire. Harris, who is serving five years and nine months for 12 indecent assaults on four girls as young as seven, has had a tough time since he was jailed in July as he has become a 'hate figure', one inmate said. But it appears he is now handing out chocolate and tobacco as he seeks to make friends. 'He is in good spirits. He is playing lots of dominoes,' a source told The Sun. 'He even treats prisoners who don't have much cash to chocolate and cakes and tobacco. 'They call him Willy Wonka after the Roald Dahl character because he is a soft touch for a Mars Bar.' Harris was attacked soon after arriving at Bullingdon and was spat at by an inmate during a prison church service which sparked a mass brawl - leaving him cowering in a pew. The prisoner who went for him called him a 'dirty nonce' because his family had been targeted by a paedophile in the past. Other angry inmates later claimed he 'queue jumped' after he was given a job in the prison's garden looking after the vegetable patch. But it has led to a charm offensive from the disgraced star and he started sketching cartoons for fellow inmates in an attempt to win them over . Scroll down for video . Tough start: Harris has been spat at and accused of queue jumping to get a 'cushy' job in the garden at HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire . Nickname: Harris is being called Willy Wonka, played here by Johnny Depp, who was the star of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory . The Australian is reportedly handing out signed drawings to convicts who queue outside his cell in the hope of securing one of his sketches. Treat: Mars bars and tobacco are now being given out by the star . One prisoner has claimed the entertainer turned down offers of cash for his drawings while other inmates have dubbed the drawing sessions 'Rolf's Prison Cartoon Club' in reference to his 1990s television programme. The entertainer settles down to draw between 4.30pm and 6.30pm while prisoners are allowed to walk between cells. The entertainer, once a family favourite, was unmasked as a paedophile who was fixated with underage girls after his trial at Southwark Crown Court. He was jailed for his decades preying on victims including and abusing his daughter's friend for 16 years. He even attacked her as his daughter slept in the same room. Artist: Harris, pictured ten years ago, is reportedly handing out signed drawings to convicts who queue outside his cell . Earlier this month it was confirmed that lawyers representing Harris have lodged papers at the Court of Appeal asking for permission to appeal against his conviction for 12 counts of indecent assault. He has already been stripped of a Bafta fellowship and faces losing his prestigious CBE in the wake of his conviction. His multi-million pound fortune is also at risk from potential compensation claims.","The 84-year-old is handing out Mars Bars during games of dominoes .

"By . Caroline Mcguire for MailOnline . A mum of two who donates her eggs for money, uses the cash she receives from the clinic to spoil her children- and even kit out her house with new carpets. Emma Frost, 25, has donated her eggs three times and received £2,250 for her efforts. She's splurged the money on carpets for her home, a day trip for her two kids and revamps of their bedrooms. And Emma is hoping to donate another seven times - the maximum allowed - for £750 a go. Emma with daughters Bailey, six, (left) and Mia, two, (right).  She has used the money from donating her eggs to treat her kids . The full-time mum, from Romford, East London, has used the cash to kit out her home but says she is happy to be helping other people experience the joy of motherhood and would donate her eggs even without the money. She said: 'The money is a bonus and it allows me to give my children a beautiful home. 'I feel passionate that everyone gets the chance to be a parent and I love giving people that opportunity.' Emma joined the fertility market when she considered acting as a surrogate for a friend of a friend struggling to conceive. The first time Emma donated her eggs, she used the £750 to buy bunk beds (pictured) for her two kids . Gemma and her two daughters Bailey and Mia in their newly revamped bedroom, paid for by egg donations . Having enjoyed being pregnant with daughter Bailey, six, but believing that she and partner Ben Hodgson were not going to have any more children of their own, she was keen to carry another baby, even if it was someone else's. But just as she was about to offer her womb as a temporary home for someone else's child, she found herself pregnant again. After giving birth to Mia, two, she decided that even if she was not going to carry another baby she could still help people realise the joy of parenthood. Emma applied to be an egg donor and found out when she arrived that there was compensation for the ten days of injections and short procedure under anaesthetic. In the last two years, she has donated eggs to three different woman who have all fallen pregnant. And with the money she has received as compensation, Emma has dramatically improved her house and treated her two children to the toys and outings she wouldn't otherwise be able to afford. After the first donation she decorated their bedrooms and bought the bunk beds they were desperate for, next she re-carpeted her house. Emma pictured with daughters Bailey (left), Mia (right) and partner Ben Hodgson. She claims her boyfriend was initially shocked when she decided to donate her eggs, but has come to understand. The last time she made the trip to the clinic and received the £750 in return, she took her family on a trip to London and put half away in an account for the girls to access when they are 18. Emma said: 'I've changed the future of another family and I want to look out for my own children's futures too. 'At first I wanted to be a surrogate. I loved being pregnant and I had no complications - it was just a fantastic experience. 'Then I found out about egg donation and decided that, as I'd had another daughter by then, this was the thing for me. Bailey (bottom) and Mia (top) have also been treated to toys, including the tricycle (pictured) and days out as a result of their mum's generosity . 'A couple of my friends have had trouble conceiving and the thought of being able to give something back was great. 'I got pregnant so easily I wanted to give someone the thing that I had. 'And being able to the do the renovations to the house and give the kids something is great. 'We took them on a big trip to London and they blew half of one of the payments on the day out which was fun. 'Then the rest of that most recent payment I put away in an account for them which they can have when they are 18. 'I've lived with my partner for six years and although he was a bit shocked and worried about the risks at first, he's fully supported me. 'My family were just so proud - people were calling me up to congratulate me when I first did it. 'You can do it a maximum of ten times, which I'm going to do. Emma wants to continue donating her eggs seven more times because she likes the feeling of helping other women out . 'I want to do it ten times because I love the feeling and the pride I get from helping another family have what I have. 'There are no bad points to donating eggs. You feel good about it and you give a family something they've always wished for.' Dr Geetha Venkat, Director of the Clinic said: 'Egg donation is an amazing treatment. 'With women who want to donate their eggs, we go through all the implications of what it involves and then once their blood tests come back clear we go ahead with the treatment.

"By . Freya Noble for Daily Mail Australia . The family of a man who was killed in a tragic road accident along with two of his children have revealed their heartbreak after the killer driver was told by a judge he could be out on parole by 2016. On June 4 last year, Shaun Zagar was in the car with his children, Kaleb, 6, and Zara, 5, in regional NSW near the town of Casino, waiting for the bus which would take them off to school for the day. 'I can just imagine they were just sitting in there in the car, minding their own business, waiting for the bus. This bullet from nowhere came out and just T-boned them,' Shaun's father Andrew Zagar told A Current Affair. Scroll down for video . Andrew and Julie Zagar have spoken of their heartbreak after the man who killed their son and two grandchildren could serve just two years behind bars . The 28-year-old father of three and two of his children, his eldest son Kaleb just a day away from his seventh birthday, all had their lives claimed by the tragic crash. This week the driver of that car Malcolm Joseph Harris was handed his sentence, one the Zagar family are outraged by. For the accident which flipped Shaun's car and rolled it over a fence before it came to rest almost 30 metres away, Harris could serve just two years behind bars. The Northern Star report Harris, was sentenced to five years behind bars for two counts of dangerous driving occasioning death and one count of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm. The 37-year-old also received an extra three years, four months jail, with a non-parole period of two years, for another charge of dangerous driving occasioning death. He is eligible for parole in March 2016. When the family heard the sentence handed down in court, they were in shock according to Andrew: 'We just shook our heads in disbelief. We thought ""what, there must be some sort of mistake""', he revealed. At the time of the fatal crash Harris is said to have had an array of drugs in his system, was driving unlicenced and with an undiagnosed epilepsy condition. Shaun, 28, Kaleb, 6, and Zara, 5, were killed in a tragic car accident in June last year . Malcolm Joseph Harris, under the influence of drugs and driving unlicenced at the time of the crash is eligible for parole in 2016 . Shaun's father Andrew said the family were in shock when they heard the sentence handed down in court . He also left his own daughter - a passenger in his car - with brain damage. Harris pleaded guilty to the deaths of Shaun, Kaleb and Zara Zagar, as well as driving under the influence, driving without a licence and the charge relating to his epilepsy condition. But the Zagar family are planning to appeal the case, meeting with prosecutors on Friday to discuss their options. 'You get life for taking marijuana into Bali. And you've killed three people and I know it might not have been intentional but he got in that car of his own free will', Shaun's mother Julie Zagar told the program. Andrew said when he saw his son's killer in court this week, Harris mouthed the words 'sorry' across the room at him. However Andrew said that didn't change a thing, as his family were serving a life sentence. Kaleb was killed just one day before his seventh birthday, waiting in the car with his dad and sister to catch the school bus . Five-year-old Zara was also in the car, and is survived by a younger brother . Zagar family are planning to appeal the case, meeting with prosecutors on Friday to discuss their options . 'You've destroyed our family, why did you do this you selfish mongrel? You selfish bloody mongrel', he said. The Daily Telegraph report that Attorney-General Brad Hazzard is investigating the situation following the public outcry. Andrew said Harris's sentence sent a weak message to the community. 'It's not sending a strong enough message to offenders who do these things. It's not sending a strong enough message to say think, before you actually jump into the car.' Kaleb and Zara's mother said in a statement to A Current Affair 'He's given us a life sentence so he should have to serve one too. I have to go the rest of my life without seeing my first born son or my only daughter.' The couple also had another son together.","Shaun Zagar and his children Kaleb, 6, and Zara, 5, died in June 2013 .

"By . Freya Noble for Daily Mail Australia . and Aap . Joshua Smart was allegedly shot in the back by his girlfriend's sister in April . A Sydney man who was shot in the back earlier this year was embroiled in a 'Romeo and Juliet' style romance with the alleged gunman's sister, a court has heard. Joshua Smart, 24, and his father Michael Smart, 49, were gunned down in April just outside their family home in Pyrmont. Michael Smart was shot in the head and hospitalised in a critical condition, and is now a cripple in the full-time care of his daughter. His son Joshua, who was shot in the back, was on parole and charged with concealing an indictable offence after police alleged he knew who their attacker was. On Thursday the background behind the alleged shooting was aired, as Smart's barrister Charles Waterstreet made an unsuccessful attempt to get his client bail. The Supreme Court heard that Smart is locked in an ongoing dispute with the family of his girlfriend Monique Farrell, with whom he had a 'volatile relationship'. Ms Farrell's brother Corey George Farrell has been charged over the double shooting and is also facing accusations of large-scale money laundering, the court heard. Smart is alleged to have taken photos of himself holding a revolver, ammunition, and a police badge and spoke of 'a bullet for each' just days before the shooting. 'It is asserted that he was going to use the hand gun to inflict death,' Justice Richard Button said. Days later, he and his father were shot - prompting Smart to allegedly send a text to Ms Farrell saying: 'Ur bro just shot me and my Dad' (sic). Smart's blood was later found on the phone from which this SMS was allegedly sent, the court heard. Scroll down for video . Smart's girlfriend's Corey George Farrell has been charged over the double shooting and is also facing accusations of large-scale money laundering, the court heard . Mr Waterstreet, Smart's barrister, said Smart had been threatened by his lover's family. 'This is what happens in Romeo and Juliet,' Mr Waterstreet told the court, adding the star-crossed lovers had now reconciled and Ms Farrell had visited Smart six times since he has been in custody. 'He doesn't act. He sends messages, yes, but he doesn't act. He is not found with any gun. He is not found with any weapon. Basically, he is all talk,' Mr Waterstreet said. He also said since Farrell had been in custody for the offences, Smart had been a target of attacks in prison. He was on parole at the time of the shooting and charged with concealing an indictable offence after police alleged he knew who their attacker was . Mr Waterstreet said his client had a 'reasonable explanation' to conceal the alleged shooting as he feared he was going to be 'hit' if he opened his mouth. But Justice Button refused bail, saying that at the time when Smart was allegedly in possession of a revolver he was on parole for recklessly causing grievous bodily harm in company. The matter will return to court at a later date.","Joshua and Michael Smart were shot in April outside their Pyrmont home .

"By . Freya Noble for Daily Mail Australia . ACCC chairman Ros Sims said at the Federal Court on Wednesday petrol retailers worked together to drive up prices . Five petrol retailers across Melbourne have been accused of colluding on bowser prices using a third-party service to share pricing information and drive prices up. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) says five major petrol retailers - BP, Caltex and the fuel-selling arms of Coles, Woolworths and 7-Eleven - acted in a way that could increase the cost of fuel. The case launched in the Federal Court on Wednesday says the way the retailers used a statistics gathering service, run by the company Informed Sources, was a breach of Australian competition law. 'The ACCC alleges that petrol retailers that subscribe to the Informed Sources service use (it) to exchange information on the price they each offer at their petrol stations on a private, and near real-time, basis,' ACCC chairman Rod Sims said in a statement. 'The exchange of this information allows retailers to monitor and respond to each other's prices and observe and analyse the pricing behaviours and strategies of their competitors,' Mr Sims continued. The service requires retailers to input their bowser prices and, in return, they receive the same information from their rivals. Scroll down for video . The retailers are accused of misusing statistics gathering service Informed Sources . Caltex rejected that it breached competition law, and said it will defend ACCC action . On its website Informed Sources says it provides 'competitive information to dynamic markets around the world'. The ACCC says the us of this allowed not only rapid price matching, but retailers could use the system to 'propose a price increase to their competitors and monitor the response to it'. They also revealed that a net petrol price increase of one cent per litre over a year could cost Australian consumers around $190 million. BP told Daily Mail Australia in a statement they are 'confident that BP has acted lawfully at all times', but could not comment further due to the ongoing proceedings. BP also said they have not acted unlawfully but would not comment further . The ACCC says the used the system not only to rapidly price match but propose a price increase to their competitors and monitor the response to it . Caltex has rejected the assertion its use of Informed Services' Oil Price Watch (OPW) service was a breach of competition law, and says it will defend the ACCC action. 'The OPW data consists of pricing information that is otherwise publicly available to everyone on petrol price boards,' it said in a statement. 'The OPW service simply makes it cheaper for subscribers to collect this data.'","The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) launched the case at the Federal Court on Wendesday .

"By . Ruth Styles . They're no stranger to topping the best dressed lists but it seems David and Victoria Beckham have amassed more than a few fans of their hair. Indeed, so popular are the couple's hairdos, they've topped a nationwide poll - and pushed the likes of Peter and Abbey Crouch and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge into second place. The Beckhams are famous for their ever-changing styles, although Victoria has stayed faithful to her simple current look for more than a year - an unusually long time for the fashion-conscious couple. Stylish: The Beckhams' current choice of hairstyle sent them shooting to the top of the poll . David, meanwhile, is currently sporting a simple short back and sides - a civilised look that is a far cry from the cornrows and mohicans of years gone by. Classic styles such as those embraced by the Beckhams proved particularly popular among those polled, with Abbey Clancy's neat waves propelling the Strictly winner and her footballer husband into second place with 18 per cent of the vote. The huge buns loved by Chloe Sims saw the TOWIE star and her boyfriend Eliot Wright take third spot, while Angelina Jolie, another fan of well-groomed waves, and Brad Pitt came in fourth. But popular though the stylish manes of Angelina Jolie and Abbey Clancy are, no one came close to the Beckhams who garnered more than a fifth of the total vote. Popular: Chloe Sims' penchant for vast buns and Abbey and Peter Crouch's classic styles were also popular . Looking good: Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are both fans of a classic hairstyle and always look  groomed . 1. Victoria and David Beckham - 23 per cent . 2.

Beckham are one of the best groomed couples I know,' explained one respondent to the poll, which was conducted by hair and beauty retailer, Hairtrade.com. 'Victoria has . definitely taught her man how to look his best, and what a heartthrob . he’s become. The pair’s hair is impeccable, and we can only hope that the rest of their brood grow up to look just like Posh and Becks.' Another . respondent added: 'The celebrity couple with the best hair has to be . Elliot Wright and Chloe Sims. They always look flawless and their great . barnets top it off. I just . hope that they stay a couple for a longer than the average reality TV . relationship so I can continue to see their great hair. I love watching . them and getting tips for styling my own.' But not everyone plumped for a celebrity couple, with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge scraping into the top 10 in ninth place with two per cent of the vote. 'Kate and Wills still have to be top for me even though Will’s hair is disappearing quickly,' revealed a respondent with a penchant for a right royal hairdo. 'Kate . always looks gorgeous and her hair is no exception.

"By . Freya Noble for Daily Mail Australia . A Queensland woman has taken to sleeping under the stairs in her public housing home as she is terrified of walking up and down the stairs of the townhouse. Holly Johnson, a single mother pregnant with her second child, is trying to get the Department of Housing to relocate her to a larger, single level property. She told A Current Affair she fell down the stairs of the house 12 months ago and fractured her ankle in three places. Holly now says she is scared of another accident and 'shakes' every time she has to face the climb. Scroll down for video . Single mother Holly Johnson wants a new public housing home so she doesn't have to use the stairs . 'I've fallen down them once, and I don't want to lose this baby, you know... it's a gift being pregnant', she told the program. She sleeps on a single mattress beneath the stairs of her Queensland home, with her young daughter's cot beside her. However she still has to make the trip upstairs many times a day as that's where the bathroom is located . Following her ankle injury Holly underwent surgery and the social worker at the hospital said the stairs should be upgraded, and that it was understandable for Holly to be concerned about using them. Holly was apparently blacklisted from the private rental market in 2006 after a dispute over conditions of her lease. She says public housing is her only option. She has taken to sleeping under the stairs after an accident last year left her with a fractured ankle . The woman insists she is terrified to climb the stairs despite having to do so each day to use the bathroom . After continuously applying for a transfer, the mother-of-one was told it may take up to eight years to move her as she is classified as having 'moderate needs'. When asked why she should be classed as high priority Holly responded that it was necessary 'because I'm scared' and said there are plenty of empty houses laying around she could move into. Housing Minister Tim Mander denied this and said there are many Australians sleeping on the street and thousands more on the waiting list to move. Holly lives in her current home with her sister and 19-year-old niece, and says another reason she should be considered for a larger home is because the family is growing. She is due to give birth in February, and insists her fear of the 'dangerous' staircase is not an overreaction. Holly has continuously applied to the Department of Housing who she says have many spare houses . She hopes to move before her second baby is born in February, but for now has moved her daughter's cot downstairs too .","Holly Johnson fell down the stairs of her Queensland housing commission  home last year .

"By . Gemma Mullin . A mother almost served her seven-year-old daughter a dead caterpillar with her lunch. Sarah Tweedie-Connor, 33, couldn’t believe her eyes when she noticed the shrivelled up bug inside a tin of sweetcorn as she was about to plate up the meal for Teri-Leigh. She made the grisly discovery after she bought the Happy Shopper branded tin of vegetables from the Premier Store near her home in Holbrooks, Coventry. The dead caterpillar which Sarah Tweedie-Connor found inside the Happy Shopper tin of sweetcorn . Ms Tweedie-Connor, a full-time mum, said: 'My daughter was off school poorly and we fancied some lunch. So I did some new potatoes and poached egg and she wanted some sweetcorn with it. 'It was nearly cooked and I stirred it and then I saw this white thing in the pan. It wasn’t until I had a closer look that I realised what it was. 'I took it out with a spoon and felt really sick. Teri-Leigh was mortified and I’m just so glad that I saw it.' She added: 'The thought of it being so close to being put on our plates makes me feel sick. Sarah Tweedie-Connor with a tin of sweetcorn similar to the one in which she found a caterpillar . 'I’ve emailed the company and had a phone call - they want me to send the empty tin and the  caterpillar to them.' Ms Tweedie-Connor also received a letter from Booker - the company that runs Happy Shopper - which read: 'We were sorry to learn that you have experienced a problem with our product and would like to offer our sincerest apologies. The Premier store in Coventry where Sarah Tweedie-Connor bought the tin of sweetcorn . 'Once we have received the product, all information will be forwarded to the manufacturers requesting a full investigation. 'Once this is complete you will be contacted with their findings.' A Booker spokesman added: 'Booker takes the quality and safety of our food very seriously. This is a very rare occurrence and we have launched a full investigation.' This caterpillar is not the first unexpected ingredient to have almost made it into a dinner. In February Nicola Davies from Staffordshire found the bug in a tin of Sweet Harvest sweetcorn from Aldi. A few weeks later Sharon McBride's grandson Conner Key managed to stop her from eating a dead cricket floating in a Del Monte can of fruit salad.

"By . Steve Nolan . At just a few days old and on his first adventure outside of his underground burrow home, it's little wonder that this tiny prairie dog pup overindulged on tasty snacks and needed to lie down. Surrounded by fresh fruit and vegetables that were almost as big as them, the pup and his siblings weren't shy in tucking in to their lunch while out playing with their mother. Two of the siblings even nibbled on the same lettuce leaf as they enjoyed their healthy meal. Flat out: This cute prairie dog pup needed a lie down after indulging in too much fruit and vegetables while having a break from playing with its mother . Hungry: The little animals aren't shy in tucking into their healthy lunch at Maryland Zoo, Baltimore . Animal loving photographer Jen Lockridge spent more than an hour watching the pups play with their mother at Maryland Zoo in Baltimore. Jen, from Annapolis, Maryland, said: 'I was amused to watch the younger pups sitting in the exhibit surrounded by animal chow that was almost bigger than them. 'The prairie dogs are fun to watch as they are very active and clever.' The black-tailed prairie dogs live in family territories called coteries. There's usually one male, around three females and their babies in each group. Adventure: The mischievous creatures were enjoying one of their first forays outside of their underground burrow . Tucking in: Two of the siblings share a piece of food as they enjoy lunch in the Baltimore sun . A typical female gives birth to three or four pups a year. Jen, 40, added: 'As they remain in the exhibit most of the time, going underground at night, the staff weren't aware of the multiple births until the babies started emerging from the holes in the ground. 'They are still not sure exactly how many there were. 'This is the first time I'ver ever seen so many smaller pups at one time.' Photographer Jen was there when the Prairie Dog Town exhibit opened at the zoo back in 2010 and she said that within minutes of moving into their new home the mischievous little animals started climbing and jumping over the walls.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A teacher who threatened to give a student an 'atomic wedgie,' swore and hit pupils with books has been banned from teaching for life. David Foster, 44, was struck off over his inappropriate behaviour with students, including playing with a girl's hair and making comments about her breasts. Foster, who was employed as a science teacher at Derby Moor Community Sports College, in Littleover, was banned from teaching in England indefinitely, by a disciplinary panel. David Foster was a teacher at Derby Moor Community Sports College in Derby, pictured, . Foster admitted swearing - with pupils reporting that Foster said one student was 's**t at chemistry' and telling another pupil, 'I love you but I sometimes don't half want to kill you: atomic wedgie. They split you in half'. Shockingly, another pupil said in a statement about Foster: 'He also mentions my breasts when playing with my hair - ""stop rubbing your boobs"".' Foster admitted saying this. Other pupils made statements which stated Foster had slapped their backs, as well as poking them and digging his elbows into pupil's backs. In a witness statement, one pupil said: 'Numerous times I have been punched in the back, smacked around the face and head with a book, pulled hair a bit.... also the books around the head and punches in the back came to the point it hurts.' Foster admitted hitting pupils on their heads with books but said he would 'have done this lightly'. The National College for Teaching and Leadership heard that, in June 2013, a number of allegations regarding the behaviour of Foster were raised by pupils. The panel's report said: 'The derogatory and abusive terms used towards pupils did not safeguard their well-being and were likely to have affected their self-esteem.' Despite a formal oral warning about his behaviour in 2011, the panel found that Foster had continued and that the pupils 'were not referring to a one-off incident'. Banning Mr Foster from teaching for life, the panel said that he had not 'demonstrated any insight into the impact his behaviour may have had on the pupils'. Foster, who did not appear at the hearing, was barred from teaching indefinitely, but has the right of appeal within 28 days. Wendy Whelan, head teacher at Derby Moor Community Sports College, said: 'Mr Foster was employed at Derby Moor and was dismissed from his post in July 2013 for reasons as detailed in the NCTL report. 'Once the school became aware of the issues highlighted, it acted swiftly to follow due process such that proper protocols were adhered to and student safety was ensured.'","David Foster was struck off after an investigation into his teaching style .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Four in ten brides admit they became 'fiercely competitive' when planning their wedding, research has shown. A study carried out among 1,000 newly married women has also revealed six in ten chose aspects of their big day just to make theirs better than their friends did. Many also admitted they'd be 'livid' if a fellow bride-to-be copied her plans, but over a third confessed they had in fact stolen wedding ideas from their own friends. Competition: Four in ten brides admit they became 'fiercely competitive' when planning their wedding, just like in the film Bride Wars starring Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway . And having great photos for social media was listed as a big motivator, as three in ten said how their wedding looked on Facebook was one of their prime wedding concerns. A spokeswoman for online gift retailer GettingPersonal.co.uk, said: 'We all know that a woman's wedding is supposed to be the best day of her life - so of course wanting it to be just right can really build pressure. 'With wedding blogs, social media and the huge furor over celebrity weddings, no wonder a bride-to-be can become overwhelmed with making everything perfect. Stresses: In addition to competition family politics, the bridesmaids putting on weight and the mother-in-law taking over were listed as most common wedding fears for modern day brides . Picture perfect: Having great photos for social media was listed as a big motivator, as three in ten said how their wedding looked on Facebook was one of their prime wedding concerns . 'But though it's stressful, it's the personal touches that really add that special something to a wedding day, so that everyone can enjoy it as much as the newlyweds.' The research showed half of all brides have gotten married within the same year as one of their friends, with a quarter who booked their weddings within the same month. And comparison to other brides-to-be was a big cause of anxiety for the women polled. One in ten brides said they would be 'livid' if a friend bought the same wedding dress as them and that it was an 'unforgivable' act. Unwanted wedding guests . Bridesmaids complaining about dresses .

A third also insisted details such as their table settings, the dress designer and general wedding theme had been copied by another engaged friend, including ten per cent who verbally accused a fellow bride of copying her. Despite this, a similar figure of 36 per cent admitted to copying aspects of other women's weddings they'd either attended or seen on social media. In addition to competition - family politics, the bridesmaids putting on weight and the mother-in-law taking over were listed as most common wedding fears for modern day brides. Whilst pressure to look great in photos, a misbehaving best man and worries about the weather also made the list. Keeping up appearances was a big issue for over a fifth who worried their photographer wouldn't capture them in the best light. One in ten fretted that their bridesmaids wouldn't be happy on the day, whilst others were anxious they'd wear unsuitable make-up or shoes. A further 16 per cent were sick with nerves over what the best man would plan during the reception. And this high level of stress lead to multiple petty arguments, the research showed - in fact, one in twenty said they even made themselves ill in an effort to make their wedding better than anyone had seen before. Over half fell out with family and friends during the planning process, with the bride's mother and future mother-in-law taking the most blame during feuds. Disputes over who could be invited to the wedding was a big argument trigger, said the women polled. Not helping the bride to plan enough was also named as a reason the women became riled, or conversely, if someone tried to butt in and take over the planning. Many claimed asking the bridesmaids to pay for their own dresses caused bad feeling, whilst one in six brides fell out with somebody who made negative comments over her choices. The spokeswoman said: 'There's definitely a trend now for every wedding to go one step further than the norm. 'We can see how important this has become to brides on our site as we now sell more personalised wedding favours and accessories than ever before.'","Study of 1,000 newly married women found 40% are 'fiercely competitive'

Cats named Coco, like this feline pictured with Battersea Dogs and Cats Home worker Claire Eaglestone, are the most likely to need to get rehomed, along with dogs named Max . Battersea currently has four cats called Coco and two called Tigger, four dogs called Buster and two called Max. Coco, aged nine, is just one example of a cat the centre has to look after, due to the previous owner no longer been able to care for her. Carly Whyborn, Battersea’s head of operations, said there are certain names which 'seem to be more unlucky for pets'. She said: 'The top five names in each category are lovely but seem to be more common in our three centres in London, Brands Hatch and Old Windsor. Cats named Princess, like this multi-coloured moggy, are regularly taken in by the shelter . Dogs named Alfie, like this pooch, and those called Max, Charlie, Buster, Bailey are the most often taken in by the Battersea Dogs and Cats Home . 'Battersea cares for all these homeless dogs and cats, regardless of their name, and hopes animal lovers will give a second chance to all the unwanted Busters, Charlies and Cocos out there.' The shelter also revealed that the most common dog breed they took in was a Staffordshire Bull Terrier, and the average age of animals arriving was one year and one month old for cats and nine months for dogs.","Battersea Dogs and Cats Home cared for around 9,000 animals last year .

Google Maps may be a good tool for locating crime, discovered a recovering addict who looked up an area in New Jersey where he used to buy drugs and found what he believes is a drug deal in action. Reddit user wowurdumb found what appears to be a shady transaction when we checked on the Camden, New Jersey neighborhood where he used to buy heroin. The Google Maps Street View shot shows two men conversing through a chain link fence and exchanging an unknown object for money, reports The New York Post. Dope spot: The Google Street View of an area in Camden New Jersey where a recovered addict used to buy his drugs shows an apparent drug deal . 'So I’ve been clean for a while and I decided to look at the old dope spot on Google maps,' he wrote. 'Was not disappointed or surprised.' Wowurdumb went on to explain that the spot he looked up was where he would buy both heroin and crack and was one of four or five spots he frequented in the Camden neighborhood. Wowurdumb is now clean, and he's attributed his sober lifestyle to those around him who support him and also to the study of Buddhism. He says he was a suburban kid who went from 'weed to percs to dope' and that drug addiction could happen to anyone. He says he was clean at the time that the photo was taken and that the area seems to have changed a bit. 'I was clean already by the time this was taken. The house actually looks different than it used to. When I used to go there the gate was open and the windows weren't boarded up yet,' he said. 'You used to have to get nodded in by someone watching the gate who would chirp to the guys in the back that you were coming. There was a small porch with an open window like you were walking up to a drive through and you'd place your order, hand over the money and be on your way.' The Mail Online tried contacting the Camden Police Department to see if police launched an investigation in the area once the photo was made public but no one was available for comment. Recovered: Reddit user wowurdumb is a former drug addict who managed to get sober with help from Buddhism and the support of others around him .","The Google Maps street view of the spot in Camden, New Jersey where Reddit user wowurdumb used to buy drugs shows an apparent drug deal .

"By . Associated Press . A reigning North Dakota teacher of the year was charged Friday with five felony counts for allegedly having sexual contact with a female student more than five years ago. A complaint filed in East Central District Court charges Aaron Knodel, an English teacher at West Fargo High School, with corruption or solicitation of a minor. He's scheduled to be arraigned on Sept. 5. Robert Hoy, Knodel's attorney, said in a statement that Knodel is not guilty and passed a lie-detector test. Teacher of the year: High school teacher Aaron Knodel was charged with five felony counts for allegedly having sexual contact with a female student more than five years ago . 'I don't know why such allegations would arise now, but the passage of time makes it much more difficult for Aaron to defend himself,' Hoy said. 'So, until we can have an opportunity to present this case to a jury, I ask that prospective jurors keep an open mind and reserve judgment, despite the salacious allegations that have been made. 'There are always two sides to every story,' the West Fargo attorney said. David Flowers, superintendent of schools at West Fargo, said at a press conference Friday that he is recommending that Knodel be placed on suspension without pay or benefits until the case is decided. Knodel had been on paid administrative leave. Flowers declined to comment about the specific allegations. 'The school district has taken necessary and appropriate steps to insure that Mr. Knodel has not had contact with students through his role as a teacher in the school district since the original complaint was filed,' Flowers said. Authorities say the incidents happened in February or March of 2009, including twice in a classroom, twice at Knodel's residence and once in the victim's car. The alleged victim was 17 years old at the time. Affair: Authorities say the incidents happened in February or March of 2009, including twice in a classroom, twice at Knodel's residence and once in the victim's car . Flowers said police told school district officials on Feb. 14 about the investigation into Knodel's conduct. 'We knew the general nature of the complaint alleged misconduct with a student,' Flowers said. 'We therefore determined that administrative leave was the best course of action.' Mike Reitan, the West Fargo police chief, said Friday the case was transferred to the state Bureau of Criminal Investigation because of Knodel's relationship with detectives within the department. 'We have shared information with the school as we have been allowed ... and have been following up with BCI to make sure the investigation continued to progress,' Reitan said. Knodel, who also coaches speech and debate at West Fargo, was named the 2014 teacher of the year by North Dakota United, the teachers union. A press release put out by the union after the award said he started both a student congress and trivia team at the school. Knodel also served as lead negotiator with the West Fargo Education Association, the release said. 'Aaron Knodel is a husband, father and highly regarded high school teacher,' Hoy said. 'He has been a positive influence in the lives of hundreds of students. As you can imagine, being charged with a crime is a devastating experience, which will impact him and his family forever.'","Aaron Knodel was charged Friday with five felony counts for allegedly having sexual contact with a female student more than five years ago .

A 30-second commercial for East Hills Shopping Center in St. Joseph, Missouri was posted on YouTube on Saturday and so far has over one million views. Though many YouTube users think the commercial is 'terrible,' it's managed to go viral almost overnight, reports ABC. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The opening: A girl sings the name of the mall off-key in the beginning of the 'terrible' commercial . Great casting: Employees of the mall hold up items like 'denim' which can be purchased at the shopping center . The commercial starts with a little girl singing about back to school shopping at East Hills Shopping Center. It then shows several of the mall's employees holding up various back to school items featured in the shopping center. 'Denim,' says on employee as she holds up a pair of the season's newest blue jeans. 'Haircuts,' sings a punk-rock looking employee as she gives the camera her most operatic voice. 'Backpacks! Backpacks! Come get your backpacks!' says a perky blonde employee. 'Boots and pants,' says a mall worker with spiked blonde hair. Singing praise: This woman sings 'haircuts' in her best operatic voice . Classic staple: 'Backpacks,' exclaims a perky blonde to the camera . 'Shoes!' screeches another employee. 'Get yourself an outfit,' says a woman in case the viewers didn't realize that the mall sells multiple items of clothing. The local advertisement may have amused some and annoyed others but either way it has gained international attention. 'Americans are good at making everything terrible,' said user Rage Smith. 'I don't know what to do. Am I supposed to dislike this, or like it? I dislike it with a passion, but that's the point so do I like it?' said Aaron Tripp. 'I don't think it's a ""terrible"" commercial when it goes viral and 1'000'000 end up watching it,' said XxDarkLightWolfxX.

Sales boost?: It's hard to say whether or not the commercial will boost sales at the mall but considering the large number of viewers it's promising . 'What an innovative form of marketing. Reverse psychology, I wanna go there to get my boots and pants,' said JamEcrivain. The mall's general manager Caroline Thalasinos spoke with NBC on Monday morning and said that the commercial was intended to be extremely 'lightheaded and funny.' 'It was extremely catchy and even though it was extremely funny, I knew a lot of people might take it seriously, and I mean, we had no idea that it was going to go viral but I knew that we were going to get attention for it and that’s what the main goal was,' she added. Thalasinos told reporters it's too soon to tell if the commercial will boosts sales but it has certainly gotten the public's attention.'When they do think of back to school shopping .... They’re going to think of East Hills Shopping Center, and I think that’s great,' she said.","A 30-second commercial for East Hills Shopping Center in St. Joseph, Missouri was posted on YouTube on Saturday .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . A former Apple executive is so frustrated with the selection of apps on the App Store, he has suggested ways in which the firm could do better. In an open letter to chief executive Tim Cook, former president of Apple's product division, Jean-Louise Gassée, called the store an ‘impenetrable jungle’. He criticised the firm for curating apps using algorithms, and instead believes they should be handpicked by a small group of technology writers. In an open letter to chief executive Tim Cook (pictured), former president of Apple's product division, Jean-Louise Gassée, called the store an ‘impenetrable jungle’. He criticised the firm for curating apps using algorithms, and instead believes they should be handpicked by a small group of technology writers . Apps are currently curated using algorithms, although a selection are handpicked each week as part of Editor's Picks. To be accepted onto the App Store, apps must be functional in that they must not crash, include hidden features or work in a way other than what the developer advertised. They must also have a user function and developers can't charge for app that doesn't do anything. Apps that present excessively objectionable or crude content will be rejected along with apps that are designed to upset or disgust users. Apps containing pornographic material, defined by Webster’s Dictionary as 'explicit descriptions or displays of sexual organs or activities intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings', will be rejected. As of June 2014, there have been 75 billion app downloads since the store launched in 1998. Gassée claimed that getting humans to choose which apps make it onto the store will make the site more ‘intelligible’, and make iOS users happier. He added that he is so convinced his idea will work, he has even offered to make the changes himself, for free. ‘Instead of using algorithms to sort and promote the apps that you permit on your shelves, why not assign a small group of adepts to create and shepherd an App Store Guide, with sections such as Productivity, Photography, Education, and so on,’ wrote Mr Gassée. ‘Within each section, this team of respected critics will review the best-in-class apps. ‘Moreover, they’ll offer seasoned opinions on must-have features, tips and tricks.’ Gassée added that a weekly newsletter could be used to identify new titles, respond to counter-opinions, present a developer profile, footnote any mistakes, and so on. This is the second time Gassée has offered to redesign the App Store. During a lobby conversation at the All Things D in 2011, Mr Gassee said he’d be happy to make these changes without payment. Mr Gassée added he is so convinced his idea will work, he has even offered to make the changes himself, for free. This is the second time Gassée has offered to redesign the App Store (selection of apps pictured). He originally offered his services during a lobby conversation at the All Things D conference in 2011 . Jean-Louis Gassée (pictured) joined Apple France in 1981 before moving to Cupertino in 1985, where he became president of the Apple Products Division . But ‘the ever-hovering Katie Cotton’ was said to have given him ‘the evil eye and that was the end of the exchange.’ Jean-Louis Gassée joined Apple France in 1981 before moving to its Cupertino headquarters in 1985, where he became president of the Apple Products Division. He is a mathematics and physics graduate from Paris and currently works at the venture capital firm Allegis Capital in Palo Alto, California. However, he did state that even though he would do his work for free, Apple would still need to pay the writers and for the infrastructure. 'As an independent publication - or, more likely, an app - an App Store Guide isn’t financially viable. 'We know it’s next to impossible to entice people to pay for information and I have no appetite for becoming a nano-pennies-per-pageview netwalker. 'So, the App Store Guide must be an Apple publication, a part of its ecosystem.' ‘As Apple has shown time and again, it’s the product that counts, concluded Mr Gassée. ‘If you see the wisdom of a human-curated Apple App Guide, and I hope you do, I will not seek credit.’ You can download the MailOnline app here.","Comments were made in an open letter to Apple chief executive Tim Cook .

"By . Lucy Waterlow for MailOnline . Princess Beatrice met brave young cancer patients today as she opened a state-of-the-art body scanner that will improve their treatment. The princess was at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children (RHSC) in Edinburgh to see the gamma ray scanning system. The 26-year-old, who works for Sony, was named Royal Patron for the Sick Kids Friends Foundation last year and has previously visited the hospital in Scotland to see the work they do. Cutting the ribbon: A smart Princess Beatrice was asked to officially open the new scanner in Edinburgh . For today's visit, where she was given the task of cutting the ribbon to officially open the scanner, she wore a navy blue dress under a smart cream coat. The scanner is the product of a £500,000 donation from the Sick Kids Friends Foundation (SKKF). The old scanner treated 6,000 children in a 13 year period. Making hospitals less scary: The Princess is pictured with some of the children who will benefit from the machine. The room has been decorated by illustrator Cate James . The new machine will enable doctors to run more advanced diagnostic tests and locate cancers which have spread, enabling them to offer a more prompt and precise treatment. Dr Mark Brougham, an oncologist at RHSC, said: 'The new system helps us detect movement in cancers, something which is vital for working out the best treatment and response. 'It is more advanced than our previous equipment and enables us to see the cancer in more detail. The information the machine gives us benefits the hospital as a whole as better diagnosis can lead to more efficient treatment.' Tour: Consultant physicist Sandy Small talks Beatrice through how the scanner works . Also present at the opening of the scanner were two of the children who will be using it. Emily Irving, 11, has been receiving treatment for Neuroblastoma, a cancer which arises in childhood and spreads from the nervous system, for a number of years. Her carer, Elaine McGill, said: 'Emily has to have the treatment every year so it is really important the process isn't scary and it's a nice environment. Brave: Emily Irving, who suffers from neuroblastoma, a type of cancer that occurs in childhood and arises from the nervous system, looks through the new scanner . 'The new scanner and room is a massive improvement on what was here before, it makes you forget what the function of the room is.' The room and scanner have been designed to make treatment as comfortable possible for the RHSC patients, and was decorated by SKKF resident illustrator Cate James. She said: 'I was asked to come up with a theme for the room and opted to go for underwater. It was nice to see the princess today but it's great to see the kids and know they like the new room.'","Princess was at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children (RHSC) in Edinburgh .

"By . Associated Press . and MailOnline Reporter . The Obama administration wants cars and light trucks to be fitted with technology that allows them to 'talk' to each other about potential collisions. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration claimed the technology could prevent as many as 592,000 left-turn and intersection crashes a year, saving 1,083 lives - and on Monday, the agency said it will begin drafting rules to require the technology in new vehicles. The technology uses a radio signal to continually transmit a vehicle's position, heading, speed and other information. Similarly equipped cars and trucks would receive the same information, and their computers would alert drivers to an impending collision. A car would 'see' when another car or . truck equipped with the same technology was about to run a red light, . even if that vehicle were hidden around a corner. Lifesaving: A 2012 photo shows a side mirror warning signal. The government has said it is taking a step toward requiring cars be equipped with tech that enables them to warn each other of potential danger . A car would also know when a car several vehicles ahead in a line of traffic had made a sudden stop and alert the driver even before the brake lights of the vehicle directly in front illuminate. Adding the technology to new vehicles . or retrofitting existing ones is expected to cost about $341 to $350 per . vehicle in 2020, but could decrease by more than $100 over time as . manufacturers gain experience making the devices, the safety . administration report said. If communities choose to invest in the technology, which works up to 300 yards away, roadways and traffic lights could start 'talking' to cars, as well, sending warnings of traffic congestion or road hazards ahead in time for drivers to take a detour. The technology is separate from automated safety features using sensors and radar that are already being built into some high-end vehicles today and which are seen as the basis for future self-driving cars. But government and industry officials see the two technologies as compatible. If continuous conversations between cars make driving safer, then self-driving cars would become safer as well. Communicating: The technology uses a radio signal to continually transmit a vehicle's position and speed - and pick up the same information from other vehicles. It allows the cars to see if a collision is possible . Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx called the vehicle-to-vehicle technology 'the next great advance in saving lives'. 'This technology could move us from helping people survive crashes to helping them avoid crashes altogether - saving lives, saving money and even saving fuel thanks to the widespread benefits it offers,' Foxx said. It will take time for the technology to reach its full effectiveness since the current fleet of vehicles on the road will have to turn over or be retrofitted. Once a critical mass of vehicles is equipped with the technology, they are expected to be able to follow each other safely at a close, pre-set distance on highways. Such 'platoons' or 'road trains' hold the potential to enhance the flow of traffic and save fuel. The information sent between vehicles does not identify those vehicles, but merely contains basic safety data, NHTSA said. 'The system as contemplated contains several layers of security and privacy protection to ensure that vehicles can rely on messages sent from other vehicles,' the agency said. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and the Association of Global Automakers praised the technology, but avoided commenting directly on the government's intention to require the technology in new cars. Instead, both groups urged the Federal Communications Commission to preserve the 5.9 GHz radio frequency for vehicle-to-vehicle communications. The frequency was initially expected to be dedicated to transportation technologies, but the commission has said it is exploring whether that frequency can be used for other wireless demands as well. 'We understand the pressing need for additional spectrum and are open to sharing this spectrum if it can be done safely,' said Gloria Bergquist, vice president for the alliance. 'We continue to urge the FCC not to compromise the use of the spectrum until it is definitively established that sharing will not interfere with the safety of the driving public.'","The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced on Monday that it will start drafting rules to require the technology in new cars .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A businessman has ended up in court – for spanking his wife. John Smith, 60, put spouse Kim across his knee and smacked her bottom five times following a row over money, a court heard. When police turned up to investigate he simply told them: ‘She deserved it.’ Magistrates this week issued a restraining order against Smith, who has been married for 18 years. Skegness Magistrates Court, pictured, heard how John Smith smacked his wife's bottom in a row over money . Skegness . magistrates’ court heard the assault took place at one of the couple’s . homes in Lincolnshire in July when a row over a £3,000 loan got out of . hand. As voices were raised, Mrs Smith feared she was going to be beaten, said prosecutor Marie Stace. Smith then grabbed her by the arm, held her face down on a sofa and smacked her several times, she added. Asad Aziz, defending, said Smith had seen red after being called offensive names by his wife during the argument. He . described how the businessman could not accept the ‘disrespect and . conduct she displayed that day’ and openly admitted he had put her over . his knee and smacked her five times. Smith had complained that the words she used were ‘unnecessary and uncalled for’, he said.

"By . Corey Charlton for MailOnline . A football fan enamoured with Manchester United has had the club's red and yellow badge tattooed permanently onto his forehead. Formerly called Zdravkov Levidzhov, the 50-year-old builder has also changed his name to Manchester United after having spent 10 years trying to convince courts to accept the amendment. While tattoos of football club badges are not unheard of, the prominent position of the Bulgarian's ink means he has been attracting plenty of attention. Scroll down for video . It took 15 court hearings before Zdravko Levidjov was allowed to change his name to Manchester United . Mr United pictured in his memorabilia filled home in Bulgaria, which he shares with his mother and pet cat . Mr United has even named his pet cat after David Beckham - his favourite player . Mr United told The Sun the tattoo acted like his own unique ID. He said: 'People don't look at me in a funny way, they look at me in admiration. 'It makes me stand out and proves my loyalty to United. I did think of having it on my arm, but that wouldn't have the same impact.' Despite his lifelong pledge of allegiance to the club, he has only been to Manchester United's home ground Old Trafford once after saving up for three years. He currently lives with his mother and pet cat - named after his favourite player David Beckham - in a flat in Svishtov, Bulgaria. While Mr United's tattoo is bold in its placement, it follows a long tradition of football club tattoos. Last year a Manchester United supporter was photographed displaying a full back tattoo that paid tribute to Sir Alex Ferguson, the Busby Babes and a clock to mark the tragic events of the Munich air crash. Below it featured Manchester United playing favourites George Best, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Eric Cantona.

Even the whirring noise of hairdryers is no match for Miles' keenness for a kip and he keeps on snoozing as they blow at full volume. The boy's mother, who holds his chin up as he drops off, to prevent a wonky haircut, says he's never fallen asleep at the hairdressers like this before. Sleeping on the job: Miles struggles to stay awake as he gets his hair cut . It seems like this was more of a power nap than a lengthy sleep for young Miles though. 'As soon as the stylist was finished, he woke up', his mother said. 'He smiled his shy smile and off we went'.

"By . Laura Silver for MailOnline . Ode to Joy is one of Beethoven's classics and is often performed by huge orchestras, but this four-year-old boy has found a unique way to play it. The boy named Hovan taps out the familiar tune on a keyboard - using only his nose - after spending a month learning the notes. The youngster is as skilled as he is cute, and will no doubt rouse a chorus of 'ahhhs' as well as a round of applause. Ode to Joy was written by poet Friedrich Schiller in 1785 before being famously put to music by composer Beethoven in 1824 as the final movement of his ninth symphony. Beethoven used a full orchestra, four solo voices and a choir to perform his version, but all little Hovan needed was his nose and a keyboard. He nose his stuff: Hoven has found a unique way to play Beethoven's Ode to Joy - with his nose .","Young Hovan learned how to play the tune after practising for a month .
After getting bored of using his fingers he took a more unusual approach .

"By . Kieran Corcoran for MailOnline . A good Samaritan who was the victim of a sickening attack after she went to investigate screams coming from a park has described her ordeal. Robyn Hannaway, 20, heard raised voices and feared a woman was being assaulted on her way home at night. Miss Hannaway put her own safety to one side as she ran over to the unlit park area behind a garage in her hometown of Hamilton, Lanarkshire. Victim: Miss Hamilton through she was coming to somebody's rescue when she was knocked out, stabbed, and had her purse stolen . But while she was looking for the victim, she was knocked out, her purse was taken and she had knife wounds to her face and stomach. She was taken to Hairmyres Hospital in East Kilbride and Police Scotland have launched a hunt for the cowardly attacker. In a Facebook post after the ordeal, Miss Hannaway warned others about her attacker's ploy. She said: 'It makes me feel sick with worry knowing that whoever's responsible for attacking me is still on the streets, the weekend's coming up and I really want people to be aware and safe. I never want anyone to go through what me and my family have in past few days. 'I was walking through Burnbank to the BP Garage around 11.30 on Sunday night by myself (stupid I know). 'When I was walking past the park opposite the garage I heard a girl screaming, so I stopped to listen for a minute in case it was just a drunken argument I overheard. 'When I was sure there were no other voices except for one girl's, who sounded like she was in pain and distress, I ran into the park to help. 'Bearing in mind it was pitch black and I couldn't see anything/anyone, I could only hear that I was getting closer to her. Scene: Miss Hannaway was walking home through Hamilton, Lanarkshire (pictured) 'As I got further into the park the girl went silent and within a few seconds I was completely knocked out by a man hitting me on the back of the head with something. 'By the time I woke up my purse was taken and while I was unconscious I was stabbed in the stomach and my face was slashed.' 'It's surreal to write, 'cause I can't believe someone so close to home where I've lived and felt safe all my life, has it in them to walk away and leave me lying there knowing there was a high chance they'd just killed me. 'I don't understand how anyone can have so much hatred for someone they don't know. 'They didn't care that they could have left my mum and dad without their youngest daughter, left my big sister without her only sister and left my family broken and devastated. 'Please be safe and don't let this happen to anyone again.' A Police Scotland spokesman said: 'We can confirm that Police Scotland detectives at Cambuslang CID are conducting enquiries into a serious assault and theft in the Burnbank area of Hamilton. 'The 20-year-old female victim was taken to Hairmyres Hospital for treatment for her injuries and was released. 'Anyone with information is asked to contact Detective Constable Dan Pulfrey on 101.'","Robyn Hannaway, 20, heard screams on way home in Hamilton, Lanarkshire .

"By . Deni Kirkova for MailOnline . A girl who once suffered panic attacks whenever she left her home has conquered her fears to become a beauty queen. Chantelle Parker, 23, from Chesterfield, developed agoraphobia when she was 19 years old and suffered severe panic attacks and anxiety when she went outside. The former Peaks College student became so terrified of the outside world she was unable to even walk to her local newsagent or shopping centre. Chantelle, 23, pictured in an evening gown as she competes for the title of Miss Nottingham . When she couldn't find work after college she stayed at home 'because I didn't really have much to get up for' But after four years of isolation Chantelle finally faced up to her fears after spotting an advertisement for Miss Great Britain. Chantelle said: 'After I finished college I was at home a lot more often because I didn't really have much to get up for. 'I was looking for a job and had decided against going to university but when I couldn't find work I started staying in the house most days and would rarely go out. 'I remember one day I went out to take my dog for a walk and this wave of panic came over me, I actually thought I was dying because I couldn't breathe. 'After that I would associate places I went as the causes of the panic attacks so would avoid them. 'But the places I could go became so narrowed that in the end I would just stay in my house where I knew I was safe.' Chantelle was fine until she developed a fear of leaving the house at 19, but faced up to it after four years . Chantelle became a recluse, excusing herself from family events and refusing friend's plans as she was too afraid to leave her home. It wasn't until she broke down crying to her mother that she sought help for the phobia that was ruling her life. She said: . 'I felt so isolated and I was even losing friends because every time . they asked me to do something I would just make up an excuse. Agoraphobia is an intense fear of being in public places where you feel escape might be difficult. Sufferers tend to avoid public places, and may not even venture out from home. The phobia tends to arise as a result of associating panic attacks with the places or situations where they occurred and then avoiding them. 'It had got to the point where when my family went out for a meal I'd make excuses and have beans on toast at home. 'One day I just broke down in tears to my mum and told her how I was feeling. 'She told me I couldn't go on like this and that I was like a prisoner in my own home, which I was. 'I went to the doctors but they just told me it was something that would pass and sent me away.' But as the months passed Chantelle's mental health worsened and she was referred to an anxiety group for help. It . was there, with the help of her mother Donna and Anxiety UK, that she learnt . how to control her panic attacks with breathing techniques. While . recovering, Chantelle spotted a Facebook advertisement for . Miss Great Britain and, although she was still struggling with her phobia, . she decided to enter. Chantelle . said: 'My mum was really worried because she didn't want it to knock my . confidence while I was still getting better but I knew I wanted to do . it. After getting used to being in the house, when she took the dog for a walk she had a panic attack . 'I sent off my picture and got through to the telephone audition round, where I spoke about my personality and life. 'Surprisingly they told me I had got through to the final stages and invited me down to Leicester. Chantelle was competing for the title of Miss Nottingham and was up against 10 other hopefuls. Despite still being afraid Chantelle knew that to compete she would need to face her fears and tackle her phobia head-on. She said: 'I knew that I needed to go out shopping and get a dress, have my nails done and get ready for the pageant. 'It was terrifying though as the last time I had stepped foot in a shopping centre I had had a panic attack. 'But I knew I wouldn't be able to compete if I didn't get over my fear. Although Chantelle did suffer a panic attack, she was able to calm herself down using the breathing techniques she'd been taught and continue her trip - something that she had never before been able to do. Whilst recovering Chantelle spotted a Facebook advertisement for Miss Great Britain and she applied . Pageant was last week and Chantelle narrowly missed out on becoming Miss Nottingham . The beauty queen hopeful said: 'I was so proud of myself when it passed because I then knew that I would be okay. 'I just kept telling myself while it was happening that ‘you can't compete if you can't do this, get over it' and I did. The Miss Great Britain pageant was held last week on August 7 at the Athena in Leicester and Chantelle narrowly missed out on being named Miss Nottingham in the semi-finals of the competition, the so-called regional heats. But for the former recluse the competition was about much more than winning as she has been able to get her life back on track. 'The competition gave me my confidence back and an aim to get up every day and head for. 'It wasn't about winning for me it was to show people that you don't have to look a certain way to suffer with a mental health issue and that people need to get rid of the stigma that surrounds mental health.'","Chantelle Parker, 23, from Chesterfield, developed agoraphobia at 19 .

"By . Naomi Greenaway . With a starring role in the original TOWIE, and a much-publicised comeback in June wearing a tiny asymmetric thong, Harry Derbidge appears a picture of confidence. But behind the cameras the 20-year-old has been battling 'food phobia' issues for over a decade. It was only two years ago when doctors said he would have to be admitted to a rehab clinic that the Essex boy started to change his eating habits. 'If I didn’t like the look or smell of food I'd hide it behind my tongue and spill . it all out in the toilet. I'd be going two or three times in a meal,' Harry admitted as he opened up to Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford on ITV's This Morning. Scroll down for video . Left: After 10 years of starving himself, TOWIE's Harry Derbidge spoke out for the first time about being 'food phobic' on ITV's This Morning; Right: The star made a recent comeback on TOWIE in an asymmetric thong . 'I was always tired and very . lazy because I had no energy going through me. When it . used to get cold I . used to shake and shiver all the time because I had no meat on me. I was just skin and bone. 'My mum would be forever sending me to a . doctor because she was always concerned about my weight,' said the TV star who admitted he used to weigh just 7st 7lbs. 'For a boy that’s really bad. The average is 10 to 11st. 'Doctors . said if I continued losing weight they would have to send me into . a clinic. For me that was the scariest point ever and that’s when I . knew I had to change.' Harry's issues, which This Morning's eating expert Dr Dawn Harper, described as a 'food phobia' started at the age of eight. 'Fussy eating is very common,' explained Dr Harper, who shared the sofa with Harry. 'Generally children grow out of it. When it becomes a problem is when it gets worse.' For Harry, what started as being a difficult eater in childhood, spiraled out of control in his teenage years. 'I've always been a fussy eater but it turned into OCD. My poor mum would bring out the food and everything would have to be separate,' he said. 'If I had a roast dinner I'd have the peas on their own, sweetcorn on its own and chicken its on own. At the time I didn’t see it as a problem because I was so young.' Harry Derbridge and Dr Dawn Harper (far left) with Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford on ITV's 'This Morning' 'I’d always have a a panic going out for bit of dinner because I knew I wouldn’t have anything on the menu,' he continued. Harry emerging from ITV studios after coming clean about his food phobia . 'Most of the time I would just go and sit with friends and just have a coke whilst they had their burgers.' When doctors told Harry he needed to be admitted to a clinic, he knew he had to change his ways. 'It took a long time,' he admitted, 'But I found what I enjoyed eating – plain food. I'd have boiled plain pasta with plain chicken. 'I started eating six meals a day but I'd make them really small so I’d always feel full. I'd also have nuts in the day and lots of protein. I've also had protein shakes and I train. 'I know I'm no pump-up Pete or anything, but it helps me bulk a little bit and look fuller. Now I’m 10st and happy with how I look and feel. But another stone for me would be perfect. 'My energy is ten times better, although I've also been diagnosed with an under-active thyroid so I'm always a bit tired. But I feel better in myself.' Good enough, in fact, to parade his filled-out body in a tiny weeny weeny asymmetric thong. 'Two years ago I would never have dreamed of anything like that,' Harry admitted. 'For me to do that was such a big thing. And hearing the response as well was amazing. It went global,' he said of the edgy swimwear trend. Harry now wants to dedicate himself to helping children with eating issues and said, 'I want to go round to schools and talk about it and turn my negative into a positive.'","Harry, 20, opened up on ITV's This Morning .

"By . Darren Boyle for MailOnline . Indonesia declared its independence from the Netherlands on August 17, 1945 in one of the first acts of post-war decolonisation. The colourful independence celebrations draw upon the many traditions of Indonesian culture, including bizarre tests of agility and strength. During World War II Indonesia had been invaded by Japan and following their surrender Indonesian nationalists declared independence. Initially, the Dutch resisted the nationalists, holding onto the country they called The Dutch East Indies. The Dutch tried to resist the independence movement, eventually accepting defeat after four years following pressure from the United Nations. One of the most bizarre parts of the Indonesian independence celebrations is the Panjat Pinang competition where men clamber up greased poles . The Panjat Pinang game was introduced to Indonesia by the Dutch colonists, who placed prizes at the top of the pole during special occasions for entertainment . Because the poles are covered in grease or oil, one man is unable to clamber up unaided as they are unable to grip and climb at the same time . As a result, the men form teams where they help each other on the understanding that they split the goodies from the top of the pole equally . In an amazing feat of strength, one man grapples with the base of the pole while his friends use him as a ladder to get to the goodies from the top . This man is guiding down a brand new bicycle which has been lowered from the top of the pole by a team mate who managed to scramble to the top . In some cases, two or three men will stand on each other's shoulders as they defy the laws of gravity in a bid to unhook the prizes from the top of the pole . As well as bicycles, which are generally the top prize, other gifts include electronic goods, and even food . Women and children look on from the ground and cheer on their friends and relatives as they try and dislodge the goodies from the top of the pole . The men have to co-operate with each other to work their way up the pole, here one of the men wraps his arms and legs to anchor himself, allowing his friend to climb . One of the biggest celebrations is in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta, which also features a flypast by members of the Indonesian airforce . Here one man stands on his friend's head, while on the right a man tries to climb over his friend who is gripping on half-way up the pole . In a remarkable display of dexterity, this man uses his feet to lower this full-size adult's bicycle from the top of the pole so it won't be damaged . The poles are nut trees which are chopped down in advance of the celebration and loaded with gifts and secured upright . The independence celebration is a major day out for Indonesian families who decorate buildings and homes in the red and white national colours . The Panjat Pinang competition is designed to teach young people the importance of working together for the common good . But some Indonesians believe that because the tradition was introduced by the Dutch colonists it should be banned as it is demeaning . A more recent objection concerns the large number of nut trees which are chopped down in advance of the celebration . The Dutch colonists introduced the tradition in the 1700s for their own amusement where they would place trinkets at the top of the greased poles . Unsurprisingly, the strongest man is positioned at the bottom of the human pyramid while the lightest, most agile climber makes his way to the top . For those Indonesians who are unable to clamber to the top of a greased pole, another competition involved competitors eating crackers . Women are not allowed to participate in the pole climbing competition, but they are allowed to take part in a special sack race which is also very popular . Other competitions involve a marble and spoon race, where participants grip a metal spoon with their teeth and walk while balancing a marble . Another bizarre game played on independence day is cone football, where players cover their faces with a cone and race around after the ball .","Indonesia declared independence from the Netherlands in August 1945 after the surrender of Japan .

He may have been seated in the VIP section, but Prince Harry showed he was no different to any other England fan as he watched the team limp to a 0-0 draw against Costa Rica in Brazil. The Prince pulled an array of tortured facial expressions, sharing the agony of his fellow supporters, as the team failed to make an impact against a second string Costa Rica side before flying home from the tournament with just a single point.

He shook hands with some of the digintaries in the box and sat down with his private secretary, Edward Lane-Fox, and with Alberto Pinto Coelho, the governor of the state of Minas Gerais. FA chairman Mr Dyke and Sir Trevor Brooking, the FA's director of football development who will retire after the World Cup, sat further along the same row to the Prince's right. But as the game wore on he became visibly tense, and at one point appeared to hold his head in his hands, unable to watch the action on the pitch.

The prince, who is on a seven-day tour of Brazil and Chile, and Mr Dyke were shown around the facility which is set to be the base for Team GB athletes during the 2016 Olympics, by César Cielo - the winner of Brazil's only Olympic swimming gold medal.

Among the British athletes likely to be selected for Brazil are Mo Farah, Jessica Ennis and Greg Rutherford - all of whom racked up Olympic gold medals in their events during the 2012 London Games.

The . prince turned down an offer to grapple with Luciano Correa . who is hoping to win a medal when his country hosts the next Olympic . Games, and battled it out for the honours on the basketball court instead. When Harry's first shot hit the rim of the hoop and bounced away he waved his hand in mock disgust and walked off. Two further efforts were also off the mark but the judo player's aim was just as bad. Correa joked afterwards: 'My ability with the basketball and Harry's was not good we both need to practice.' Later, the prince will be driven to the Estádio Mineirão for England's dead rubber match against Costa Rica, who are already in the second round.

"By . Darren Boyle for MailOnline . A woman who threw a kettle of boiling water at her boyfriend's groin after she claimed he had slept with her daughter has been jailed. Helen Corbett was made the subject of a restraining order after she she pleaded guilty to the assault but the following day she was back at her partner's property and taken into custody. Judge John Evans told the court that he was going to release Corbett, 45, but he believed that would be 'setting her up to fail'. Peter Bailey suffered serious burns to his legs after he partner threw scalding water towards his groin . Helen Corbett, pictured, accused Mr Bailey of sleeping with her daughter, 24, before launching the attack . Mr Bailey suffered serious burns to his leg, pictured, following the attack in Gateshead in April . Corbett missed 46-year-old Peter Bailey's private parts with the water but caused serious burns to his thighs which left his skin peeling off when she attacked him in April this year. Mr Bailey has forgiven Corbett for the gruesome attack and says he still loves her. He added: 'We both still love each other. Helen has sent me letters from prison and she has recently gave me a card telling me how much she still wants to be with me. 'I will always keep that card close by. We want to move on from the incident and be together.' Corbett, 45, had heard rumours Mr Bailey was sleeping with her 24-year-old daughter Crystal. Corbett sent a card to Mr Bailey from prison, pictured, expressing her undying love for her victim . Mr Bailey, pictured said at the time of the attack he had not slept with Corbett's 24-year-old daughter Crystal . Prosecutor Neil Pallister told Newcastle Crown Court: 'The defendant was angry with him because she believed he had slept with her daughter. 'He was in the doorway, she was shouting at him ""have you slept with my daughter"". 'He heard the kettle click. 'She said ""I will show you how mad I am"", picked up the kettle, and threw boiling water towards him. 'He recalls she was aiming for his groin.' Mr Bailey suffered a large burn to his left thigh. Mr Bailey admitted that after he was released from hospital he then slept with Corbett's daughter Crystal claiming he was 'stupid' and made a 'mistake' In a victim impact statement read to the court at an earlier hearing Mr Bailey said: 'I cannot believe what Helen did to me. 'Since the incident I have been in a great deal of pain, I have struggled to sleep, I have flashbacks of what she did. 'I loved Helen, although we had our ups and downs. 'I didn't expect her to do that to me. 'Helen hurt me, both physically and emotionally. Every time I see my scar I think about what she did. 'It will be a lifelong reminder.' Corbett, formerly of Portmeads Rise, Birtley, Gateshead, admitted causing grievous bodily harm at a previous hearing. Sue Hirst, defending, told the court how Corbett was remanded in custody after being caught at Bailey's house in Portmeads Rise, Birtley, Gateshead, thus breaking her bail conditions. Judge John Evans told Miss Hurst: 'This relationship is unhealthy to put it mildly.' He added: 'They are bad for each other and there is no point releasing her just for her to be arrested again. 'If she is not going to help herself then there is no point.' Judge Evans adjourned today's sentencing to give probation workers the opportunity to find somewhere for Corbett to live if she were to be released, but unfortunately nowhere could be arranged. Judge Evans called the situation 'disastrous'. He said: 'This is a very unhappy state of affairs but it is the reality. 'You have been in custody for just over five months. 'In terms of your choice of partners, it has left a lot to be desired and in the future I see you running into more trouble if you're not more discerning about who you choose to live with. 'I was minded to impose a restraining order limiting your ability to return to your ex-partner, but I'm not going to set you up to fail, I am going to impose a prison sentence. 'I hope that when you are released accommodation will be found for you away from the complainant. 'Your drinking is a really serious problem, you have got to make a decision to help yourself.' Judge Evans sentenced Corbett to 15 months in prison and ordered her to pay a £100 victim surcharge. Mr Bailey, pictured, said he does not want Corbett banned from contacting him, claiming that they both have made mistakes: 'I have forgiven her knowing that she has also forgiven me', he added, 'I love her to bits' But speaking from his home in Birtley, Gateshead, said: 'Helen had a moment of madness when she scolded me, she thought that I had slept with her daughter, Crystal but that was completely false. 'I was in so much pain, I have scars on my legs but I would take her back. 'When Helen was in prison and once I came out of hospital, Crystal came over to see me when I was in bed. 'She said that everyone was blaming us any way so we may as well sleep together, so we did. She only came over because she wanted to persuade me and I fell for it. 'I was stupid and I made a mistake. 'I know Helen has also done wrong but don't I want her to be banned from contacting me. 'I have forgiven her knowing that she has also forgiven me. 'We want to move on as a couple as I love her to bits and I know we both respect each other now.'","Helen Corbett threw boiling water at Peter Bailey over infidelity claims .

"By . Jennifer Smith for MailOnline . A young mother drowned herself after becoming mistakenly convinced she was dying of stomach cancer. Seemberjeet Kaur believed her organs were failing for weeks after becoming 'consumed' by the ill health of her four-year-old daughter. The 35-year-old from Bradford, West Yorkshire, gave up her job at a nursery to care for the child in the months before her death. Seemberjeet Kaur took her own life after becoming convinced she had stomach cancer, an inquest heard . An inquest heard how the mother-of-one visited the doctor after rapidly losing weight in August 2013. She was prescribed a muscle relaxant, but self-diagnosed herself as having stomach cancer after researching symptoms on the internet. On October 23, after making repeated phone calls to her husband saying she was not feeling well, Mrs Kaur took a taxi to the  River Aire. CCTV footage showed the woman walking down a canal towpath. Her body was discovered six weeks after she vanished in water near Leeds railway station. Mrs Kaur married her husband Balijeet Sing Kang through an arranged union in 2006, the inquest heard. The couple lived with family before moving into their own home, and welcomed their daughter after three years of marriage. In a statement Mr Kang said: 'It was an arranged marriage but one we were both happy with as we spent time talking and getting to know each other. 'She was always close to her family and spoke to them once or twice a week. She got on with everyone easily.' After their daughter had a 'severe' eczema and a bout of pnemonia, Mrs Kaur 'did not leave her side,' he added. 'She got a bit protective. It snowed one day and she did not want me to take her outside. 'She was consumed with her health. She talked to everyone about it all the time.' At the time of her death Mrs Kaur was not working as she had given up work to look after their child which had a negative effect on the nursery worker. The young mother's body was found in the River Aire (pictured) near Leeds railway station six weeks after she vanished . 'This affected her. She didn’t go out much but spent time at the house. 'She seemed happy but disappointed not to work. She liked the house to be clean and tidy and she was a bit OCD about this. She didn't have any hobbies or go out much,' Mr Kang said. In August 2013,the British Gas worker said he noticed a change in his wife's behaviour. 'We went on a day out to York. I began to notice a difference in her behaviour. 'After a week and a half she had lost weight. She researched on the internet to find out what the matter was and thought she had found or identified her problem. 'She then went to the doctors and they gave her something for it but it didn't help. She went back and the prescribed something else - a muscle relaxant.' After a week taking the relaxant Mr Kang recalled his wife calling him at work saying she didn't feel well. She was to make several calls of this nature before disappearing on October 23, it was heard. On the day of her death, she asked Mr Kang to drop their daughter off at nursery because she felt weak and unwell. When the child wasn’t collected at 11.45am, a relative contacted Mr Kang to raise the alarm. Inquiries revealed Mrs Kaur told a taxi driver who had picked her up at 10am from her house that she was going to meet a friend. After reviewing CCTV footage it emerged the 35-year-old had gone to the river. Her body was discovered six weeks later. Recording a verdict of suicide Coroner Roger Whittaker said: 'She felt physically unwell and after numerous trips to A&E nothing had been discovered. 'She started to think that she was unwell and other family members were unwell. 'She was under the impression that a number of her organs were failing and that she suffered from stomach cancer. 'There were phone calls to her parents and to her doctors and other members of the family and regular visits to the doctor and yet no illness or cure was diagnosed. 'She told her husband she wanted her death to be quick. She mentioned slitting her wrists in last few weeks so her husband hid knives in the kitchen. 'It seems to me this death was caused by Seemberjeet herself who was exhausted by feeling of despondency and despair over a period thinking she had been unwell. 'Exhaustive examinations showed she was not. 'I take the view she lowered herself into the River Aire and allowed herself to be carried downstream. 'I record a verdict that she took her own life whilst the balance of her mind was disturbed.'","Seemberjett Kaur became convinced that her organs were failing .

The footage was captured on a dash-mounted camera of a car waiting at a junction in Odessa, Ukraine. As the car waited at the lights, a white Citroen turns left, across the junction, but his forced to stop by pedestrians crossing the road. This is the moment the scooter carrying the two teenage girls ploughs into the Citroen in Odessa Ukraine . Both girls bounce off the car's bonnet before being thrown into the air and onto the roadway . Artem Labrov, 16, who was driving the scooter can be seen here in green, cartwheeling through the air . As the car pulls up to a halt, a scooter carrying two teenage girls comes shooting from the left of the screen, ploughing into the car's wing, launching the two girls into the air. Several pedestrians duck, as parts of the scooter are ripped from its body and scattered into the crowd. At the moment of impact, both girls are thrown head-first onto the car's bonnet, before cartwheeling and slamming into the ground, about 10 feet from the car. Two of the pedestrians are knocked over by the girls, neither of whom are wearing a helmet or any form of protective clothing. As the two pedestrians struggle to their feet, both girls remain immobile on the roadway as a third onlooker checks one of them for a pulse before running off. Police investigating the case believe the Citroen's driver Nikita Ravgov, 53, caused the accident by pulling across the roadway. Both Artem Labrov, 16 and her passenger Yulia Zhalbova, 15, were seriously injured in the crash. Witness Yefim Sozonov, who filmed the incident on his dash-cam said: 'We were just waiting at the junction for the lights to change, then all of a sudden, wham.

"By . Richard Spillett for MailOnline . Four people have been arrested on suspicion of involvement in a spate of attempted letter bomb attacks in Northern Ireland and England, including on a number of Armed Forces recruitment offices. Two men, aged 35 and 46, and two women, aged 21 and 44, are being questioned over the sending of explosive devices to  careers offices in Oxford, Brighton, Canterbury, Aldershot, Reading, Chatham and Slough in February. They were detained in Londonderry and have been taken to the Police Service of Northern Ireland's (PSNI) Serious Crime Suite in Antrim. In October last year, dissident Republicans opposed to the peace process were blamed for sending a series of letter bombs to high profile political and security figures in Northern Ireland and to Army recruiting offices in England. None of the devices detonated. Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers and former PSNI chief constable Matt Baggott were among those targeted by letters sent to addresses in Northern Ireland . In the Northern Ireland attacks, one of the devices was sent to Stormont Castle in Belfast addressed to Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers. Another bomb was delivered to the offices of the Public Prosecution Service in Londonderry while another two explosive packages - one addressed to then PSNI chief constable Matt Baggott and the other to one of his senior commanders - were intercepted at Royal Mail offices in Belfast and Lisburn. The sending of bombs in the post marked the re-emergence of a terror tactic that was used by paramilitaries during last half of the 20th century in a period known as the Troubles. Since 2009, republican extremists intent on achieving a united Ireland by violent means have murdered two soldiers, two policemen and one prison officer in Northern Ireland, as well as carrying out numerous other attacks on security force targets. The Army Recruitment Centre at The Queensmere Centre in Slough was one of those targeted in the attacks . Letters addressed to Maghaberry High Security Prison were also intercepted in Northern Ireland . The PSNI said its detectives had been liaising with officers from the South East Counter Terrorism Unit in England. A PSNI spokesman said: 'Police investigating a series of devices sent to addresses in Northern Ireland and England last year and earlier this year have arrested four people in Londonderry this morning. 'Two men aged 35 and 46, and two women aged 21 and 44, were arrested in the city and taken to the Serious Crime Suite at Antrim police station for interview. 'The investigation is being led by detectives from PSNI Serious Crime Branch who have been working in close liaison with officers from the South East Counter Terrorism Unit in England.'

"By . Richard Spillett for MailOnline . The father of England star Jordan Henderson has revealed he kept his battle with cancer secret so it would not affect his son's football performances. Brian Henderson, 59, was diagnosed with the disease in his tongue and throat in November and needed life-saving radiotherapy. But he delayed breaking the news to his son during a crucial part of Liverpool's season for fear he would put the midfielder off his game. Brian Henderson - pictured with a shirt from his son, Jordan's, time at Sunderland - delayed telling his son about his cancer because he feared it might affect his performances on the pitch . Mr Henderson's battle with cancer came at a time when his son's club, Liverpool, were trying to win the Premier League and Jordan was vying to get in England's World Cup squad . Mr Henderson only told his son just before he was about to have surgery earlier this year and his treatment has now been declared a success. He has now told how Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers and the Merseyside club supported him and his family through his battle with the disease. He said he told Jordan, 24, to make him proud by putting in as many man of the match performances as he could and his son rose to the challenge. He had the cancer of his throat and tongue removed and after gruelling radiotherapy treatment is now on the road to recovery. Mr Henderson, a retired police officer, said: 'It was a very emotional time when I had to break the news to the family. 'I went to speak to Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool who was very understanding. He gave Jordan time off, and the people at Liverpool were amazing. They were very understanding and gave him a lot of support.' Mr Henderson needed radiotherapy to treat his cancer and only told his son before he went in for surgery . He said the thought of his son playing for England in the World Cup helped him through the cancer battle . He added: 'I said to Jordan that the best thing he could do for me when he got back to playing was try to get man of the match in every game. 'People didn't realise the pressure he was under. I was so proud of him.' Medics discovered a tumour in Mr Henderson's neck when he was having a cyst removed in November and tests revealed he had carcinoma of his throat and a tumour on his tongue. The grandfather and his wife Donna, 40, a social worker, held off telling Jordan and Mrs Henderson's son Kyle Cunningham, 22, until after Christmas. Mr Henderson, from Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, had surgery to remove lymph nodes in both sides of his neck and the tumour from his tongue, leaving a hole the size of a 50p piece. Mr Henderson said Jordan's club, Liverpool, and manager Brendan Rodgers were very supportive . Jordan (right) rose to a challenge set by his father and won three man of the match awards during the season . Mr Henderson lost four stone during chemotherapy, which he described as the 'worst thing I've ever had in my life'. Determined to make his father proud, Jordan got man of the match three times last year. Brian was still recovering from his treatment when the World Cup started and was unable to go to Brazil to watch Jordan play. He added: 'He was really looking forward to the tournament and was buzzing about it. That helped me through, I knew it could change his life. 'He was disappointed by the outcome but it was an experience for him.' Mr Henderson is due to speak at a conference for the survivors of head and neck cancers at Sunderland FC's Stadium of Light next month.","Premier League star's father, Brian, diagnosed with disease in November .

"By . Lillian Radulova For Daily Mail Australia . Disturbing images of skin-and-bone hens perching on mountains of faeces and crammed into overcrowded cages have been alleged to be from a local NSW farm which supplies its eggs to one of Australia's biggest egg producers. Pace Farm, Australia's leading supplier, marketer and distributor of eggs and egg products, was fined $3000 for the conditions at the same Corowa facility in May last year, with the farm manager also receiving a $500 fine. Now, alleged new photographs and video footage from the same farm, anonymously supplied to the national animal protection organisation Animals Australia, show that conditions at the caged-egg providing facility continue to breach multiple animal welfare regulations. Scroll down for video . Disturbing new images anonymously supplied to Animals Australia, have revealed the disturbing conditions of a Pace Farm caged-egg facility in Corowa, New South Wales . The images and video footage show skin-and-bone hens perching on mountains of faeces and crammed into overcrowded cages . Animals Australia has lodged a complaint with the RSPCA, claiming that the farm has again crammed more birds into their cages than welfare regulations allow, and that many appear in poor body condition. The organisation claims the breaches come under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act as well as the Model Code of Practice. 'Dozens of birds, many in poor condition, were discovered abandoned in manure pits below the cages, without access to food or water. The severely de-feathered animals appeared to be surviving on scraps, beetles and eggs,' Lyn White, the campaign director for Animals Australia said. 'That's twice in fourteen months this facility has been found overstocking birds in cages, shows why industry auditing systems cannot be trusted.' This is despite Pace Farm’s decree on their website, which states: ‘We've invested heavily in developing innovative, state of the art facilities to exceed worldwide standards in flock care, product quality, environmental impact and bio-security. 'Our farms are regularly subject to independent audits to ensure their compliance with national and international accreditation schemes.' Pace Farm was fined $3000 for the appalling conditions at the same Corowa facility in May last year, with the farm manager also receiving a $500 fine . The campaign director for Animals Australia, Lyn White, said some hens were discovered abandoned 'without access to food or water and appeared to be surviving on scraps, beetles and eggs' Pace Farms is also a part, Egg Corp Assured, a national egg quality assurance program which sets 'strict guidelines' on a number of issues including 'hen health and welfare', according to its website. However a spokesperson for Animals Australia, Lisa Chalk, explained that there is a lack of independent oversight of factory farms in Australia, with no government inspection program of factory farms set up in NSW at all. 'This case not only reinforces the cruelty of the battery cage but reveals why independent auditing is desperately needed given the ongoing failure of industry and government to enforce even the most basic standards,' Ms White said. In this picture, Animals Australia has identified the number of hens in one cage. They claim the farm has again crammed more birds into their cages than welfare regulations allow . Animals Australia has lodged a complaint with the RSPCA and blames a lack of independent audits on the poorly monitored welfare of hens across factory farms in Australia . Due to a lack of government oversight or review of battery cage eggs, Animals Australia and animal protection groups have said the only way consumers can ensure they are not supporting cruelty is by not buying cage eggs. 'Continuing to confine millions of birds this way in Australia is indefensible, especially when other countries have long recognised and acted on this cruelty,' Ms White said. 'You cannot look at these poor hens crammed together and morally justify the lives they are forced to lead. We bring these birds into this world only to suffer. Cage eggs may be cheaper, but it is the birds that are paying a dreadful price.' Daily Mail Australia have contacted Pace Farm for a comment but are yet to receive a response.

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . It's a problem all bird-lovers will relate to - you go out and buy expensive seeds and leave them out in your feeders - only for a greedy squirrel to come along and steal the lot. But a Utah couple have come up with an ingenious solution, which involves turning their feeder into a squirrel slip'n'slide. Robert and Nancy Krampf, from Johnson Canyon, were being constantly thwarted by one particularly plump critter, which would run up the pole to their bird feeder and make off all of their seeds stored in its cheeks. Scroll down for video . Slipping away: The greedy squirrel has been thwarted by Robert and Nancy Krampf's simple Vaseline trick . But by adding Vaseline to the pole, they have not only made a lot of hungry birds very happy, they have also created a hilarious YouTube hit. The video shows the persistent squirrel trying time and time again to clamber up the greasy pole, only to slide all the way back down every time. It tries several different tactics, including working its way up slowly from the bottom and taking running leaps at the pole, but no matter what, the result is always the same. Failed again: The plucky rodent refuses to give us, but each time finds itself back at the bottom of the pole . Mr Krampf posted as the caption to the video: 'The Rock Squirrel has been raiding our bird feeder, carrying away pounds of seed. Nancy figured a quick solution. I don't know which is funnier, the squirrel or Nancy's narration. 'For anyone who is concerned about the squirrel, he still raids our other two feeders and the vegetable garden. The tiny amount of Vaseline used is non-toxic, the kind used for lip balm. He quickly learned that this feeder was not worth the trouble, so we have not put more on the pole, and the birds are delighted to actually get some of the bird seed.' Eyes on the prize: The feeder which the squirrel had been so eagerly raiding until the Vaseline saved the day . The couple laugh hysterically as they watch the poor squirrel's failed thieving attempts, while Mrs Krampf adds sound effects and comments: 'He's not going to give up, is he?' Mr Krampf runs a website called 'The Happy Scientist', on which he posts entertaining and informative videos teaching people about everything from rocks to rubber bands, as well as performing experiments. On the squirrel video, he said: 'You could find some science in it if you think about friction, animal behavior, etc., but most people enjoy it because of Nancy's funny narrative and sound effects.'","Utah couple come up with ingenious way to thwart plump bird seed thief .

"By . Julian Robinson . They say that elephants never forget - but this confused baby certainly got himself in a muddle when he became separated from his herd. The young elephant and his family became mixed up with livestock belonging to the Samburu community in the remote Ndoto Mountains in Northern Kenya. But when panic set in, the tiny youngster - who was just hours old - became confused and wandered off with the herders and cows. Scroll down for video . Thirsty work: Ndotto the elephant, who got separated from its family when it followed some cattle, takes a drink from carers at a specialist elephant orphanage in Kenya . Rescue: Barely a day old, the baby elephant is eased out of the helicopter by carers before undergoing specialist care . Back on his feet: Carers gave the tiny elephant a warm blanket and helped him support his body as he walked around. He had got separated from his family after following a herd of cattle in the mountains . Touch down: Ndotto was helicoptered to safety of the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust elephant nursery . Too young to know any different and with a fresh umbilical cord and pink ears, the tiny animal trotted off with the cattle. The Samburu community cared for the elephant, who had barely mastered how to walk, before one of them set off on a 24-hour journey by foot down the mountainside to find help. The area was so remote, that a helicopter had to be chartered so it could be transported to the safe haven of the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust’s elephant nursery, which specialises in caring for orphaned baby elephants. After being discovered among a herd of cattle, members of the Samburu community looked after the animal for 24-hours while help was on its way . Best foot forward: Weighing no more than 50kg and with a fresh umbilical cord, Ndotto is helped to his feet by carers . As a new born, the youngster will be given elephant plasma which is vital to trigger his immune system . The elephant was so young when it was found by farmers that it had barely mastered the ability to walk . Workers named the animal ‘Ndotto’ after the place of his rescue. 'At no more than 50Kg, the Keepers could easily carry him in their outstretched arms before they laid him in blankets in the stockades providing special formula milk and a glucose drip’ said Rob Brandford, Director at the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust. 'Unfortunately, whilst he was cared for by the Samburu community, he was fed cow’s milk – potentially life threatening for elephants who cannot tolerate this type of milk. Bedding in: Ndotto, named after the mountain range where he was found, takes a look around his new surroundings at the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust . Weighing in at just 50kg, it was easy for carers at the nursery to carry the young elephant from the helicopter to his new home . The animal will be given a special diet including elephant plasma to build up its strength . 'We’ll do all we can to remedy any side effects and be by his side all the way through the weeks, months and hopefully years to come.’ As a new born, he will be given elephant plasma which is vital to trigger his immune system - especially if he had not yet had the chance to ingest his mother's milk. Mr Brandford added: ‘A rescue mission like this is a huge financial cost, and until his reintegration little Ndotto will require full time care and support.'

"By . Richard Spillett for MailOnline . Paul Gascoigne's step-daughter Bianca hit back today after trolls suggested she should have done more to help her step-father. Former England player Gascoigne is in hospital after he was led away from his home in Sandbanks, Dorset by police and an ambulance crew yesterday following worried neighbours' calls to emergency services. Step-daughter Bianca, 27, was seen at a premiere of the film Sin City 2 on Wednesday, the day before her step-father was seen clutching a . bottle of gin as he staggered . around outside his home. As the sad news about her step-father emerged this morning, vile trolls took to Twitter to mock the ex-footballer and blame glamour model Bianca. Scroll down for video . Bianca Gascoigne was attacked by Twitter trolls today after she was spotted at a film premiere the day before her ex-footballer step-father, Paul, was hospitalised after a drinking session at his home in Dorset . Paul Gascoigne was pictured clutching a bottle of gin yesterday amid fears he has lapsed back into alcoholism . Twitter trolls accused the former footballer's step-daughter of not being there for her step-father . But she hit back, accusing the trolls of not knowing what they are talking about . One webuser wrote: 'At a premier (sic) yet 4 hrs later thanking Paul's well wishes. Here's a thought, be with him 4hr earlier' Another asked: 'Why aren't you there for him now he clearly needs you?' One online bullying told the glamour model her step-father was 'done' and another branded Bianca 'attention seeking'. Bianca hit back this afternoon, tweeting: 'There are some sick twisted . people out there have some compassion don't know why people feel the . need to be so nasty & have opinions they know nothing about.' Her response came as it emerged Gascoigne could be forced out of the £3million rented home he has been living in on the south coast. The director of the management company in . charge of the flats where Gascoigne has been living today dismissed . claims he is being evicted, but said his landlord was not renewing the rental contract. Christopher Eales, 84, said: 'The only thing I can tell you is that he has not been asked to leave. 'His lease will run out on September 13 and the landlord will not be renewing the contract as he wants the flat back.' The former England footballer was seen with his head in his hands outside his home in Sandbanks, Dorset . After being spotted with cans of beer, he was escorted away by police and an ambulance crew . The news came after shocking . pictures emerged showing the former player - once the country's most gifted . midfielder - slumped, head in hands, outside his penthouse apartment. Gascoigne was . taken from the flat by medics and driven to Poole . Hospital yesterday afternoon and he remained there this morning. QPR manager Harry Redknapp, who also . lives in Sandbanks, today offered Gascoigne the chance to work alongside . him in football. He . said: 'I saw him about a month ago and said ""I'll pick you up in the . mornings, Gazza, come training with me and do a bit of work with the . kids"". I’d love it if he could do that. It's an open invitation. 'He's a great lad and it's sad to see what’s happened to him and how he's looking at the moment.' In a TV documentary shown last . September, Gascoigne described the pain of fearing he might start . drinking again, despite knowing it could kill him. The former footballer looked much older than his 47 years as walked around with a bottle of spirits . Dressed in a pair of slippers and holding a bag full of cans of lager, the  star looked a shadow of his former self . It is believed worried neighbours called emergency services after the 47-year-old was seen drinking . Gascoigne is believed to have been taken to hospital for his own safety after he was again seen drinking . Gascoigne spoke of his addiction and a previous relapse earlier this year in the . ITV show Being Paul Gascoigne. He said: 'I just . remember one bit after the third day of being in hospital when he (the . doctor) said ""I don't think this guy is going to make it"" and I sort of . put my head up a little bit and I was like, tubes in my arms and an . oxygen tank injecting round my heart and lungs and that.' He added: 'I just come forward and I . went ""I don't want to die, I need to water the plants"" and that was it . and then I woke up two weeks later. 'With . me now, if I did have a drink and relapse, it's like becoming tipsy and . merry is OK for a couple of days but like the next mouthful I'm so . down, I'm so depressed, I cry. 'I . do all that because I know inside I'm hurting myself again. I know . where I'm heading - a wooden box. Or I'm back in treatment or hospital. Or getting sectioned.' The one-time England star looked unsteady on his feet as he walked around Sandbanks in Dorset . Gascoigne has long battled drinking problems and went to a rehab centre in the US last year to save himself . He was taken to nearby Poole Hospital for his own safety after worried neighbours raised the alarm . It had been claimed that Gascoigne . was set to make his return to football after a journey for cigarettes . led him to meet taxi driver and Abbey FC manager Chris Foster - who . convinced the former England international to sign for the Hayward . Sunday League side. The . 47-year-old enjoyed a memorable professional career which saw him play for the likes of Newcastle United, Tottenham Hotspur, Lazio and Rangers, whilst . also becoming a firm favourite among many England supporters. Gascoigne, who has been plagued by . alcoholism and drug addiction, last played professional football trn years ago when he made five appearances for then-League Two side Boston . United. Daren Hills, secretary of the Bournemouth Football Association, confirmed that his registration has been received. A spokesman for Gascoigne decline to comment on the incident outside his home. Gascoigne's former teammates rallied around today as the star remained in Poole Hospital. Chris Waddle, who played in the 1990 World Cup where Gascoigne made his name, took to twitter to offer his support. He tweeted: 'I know it's hard to stay focused but you have so many people who want you to come through this come on stay strong' Above a picture of the pair playing together for England, he then added: 'Love you mate' Another of Gascoigne's Italia '90 teammates, Match of the Day Presenter Gary Lineker, also offered a serious message for the troubled star. In comments reported in the Daily Record, he said: 'Ultimately the support has got to come from Gazza himself. 'We've supported him over years, Tottenham and his friends. I wish him well but ultimately it's got to come from Paul.' The former midfielder shot to worldwide fame after his performances at the 1990 World Cup . Gascoigne - once one of the country's most gifted players -  was seen slumped outside his penthouse apartment in Sandbanks, Dorset. He was later taken to Poole Hospital . Gascoigne was accused of being 'under the influence of alcohol' while manager of Kettering in 2005 . 1998 -The full extent of Gascoigne's drinking problems became clear when he was still playing. He was checked into the Priory rehab clinic in 1998 by his then-manager at Middlesborough, Bryan Robson. The treatment followed a year of trauma during which he was dropped from England's World Cup squad, divorced from wife Sheryl and faced the death from alcoholic poisoning of close friend, David Cheek, after they had spent a night out together. He was released, at his own insistence, two weeks into the suggested minimum stay of 28 days. 2001 - After joining Everton he missed a friendly with Tranmere during Everton's pre-season build-up. It later emerged he was attending a rehabilitation clinic in Arizona, USA, where he was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder. 2004 - After a spell with a Chinese B-league side, Gascoigne returned to Britain but was involved in a car accident when he drove his four-wheel drive BMW into a parked truck. He escaped without serious injury and later joined Boston United as player-coach, before leaving after just two matches. In a bizarre episode, he then announced he wanted to change his name to G8. 2005 -  The former England football star was hospitalised with pneumonia. He was later appointed manager of non-league Kettering, but left the club after 39 days following claims by the club's chairman that he was 'under the influence of alcohol before, during and after several first-team games and training sessions'. Gascoigne denied the claims, insisting: 'I had a double brandy before one of the games, but it used to be four bottles of whiskey a day - it's not now.' 2008 - Gascoigne was sectioned after reportedly wielding a steak knife in the Malmaison hotel in Newcastle. The . hotel's manager said at the time that he was 'potentially a menace to other . guests. The guests in the room next to him were moved out as they felt . intimidated.' Gascoigne leaves Newcastle Magistrates Court in 2010 after getting a suspended sentence for drink driving . 2010 - Gascoigne appeared at the scene of a tense police stand-off with killer Raoul Moat, reportedly claiming he had brought the gunman 'a can of lager, some chicken, a fishing rod, a Newcastle shirt and a dressing gown'. He later said of the incident: 'I thought, ""Moaty won’t shoot me, I’m good friends with him"". I thought I knew him, but I’d been drinking.' Later that year he was given a suspended prison sentence for drink-driving after magistrates heard he was four times the legal limit. 2013 - After slurring his words and appearing confused in a charity stage show, Gascoigne was again sent to the US for treatment. Footballers past and present and friends Chris Evans and cricketer Ronnie Irani contributed to his rehab fund. After returning to Britain, he was found slumped outside a London hotel. He was later fined £1,000 for assaulting a railway security guard in Stevenage and being drunk and disorderly. 2014 - Earlier this year, Gascoigne again entered an extensive rehabitilition programme at a £6,000-a-month clinic in Southhampton, the seventh time he had entered such a facility. He received treatment again last year after appearing confused at a charity function in Northampton .","Pictures emerged of Gascoigne wandering around with lager and spirits .

"By . Jenny Awford for MailOnline . An endangered penguin chick born with  splayed legs finally has 'happy feet' after wearing a special pair of trousers which  fixed the deformity. The adorable animal was born at Sea Life Scarborough, Yorkshire, and staff realised it had the problem when he was around three weeks old. They believe the deformity was caused by first-time parents, Pinky and Kev, sitting on it too heavily. A Humboldt penguin chick born with splayed legs finally has happy feet after a pair of special trousers were made for him which has helped fix the deformity . Once staff realised they began wrapping its legs in tight fitting trousers made from an elasticated material. It was also regularly placed inside a shallow pot to gradually correct the positioning of his legs as he grew. After six weeks of treatment, the little creature's legs are back to the usual position and it can waddle like any other Humboldt penguin. Staff at the sea life centre  will not know the gender of the chick until a DNA test is carried out as part of a veterinary check, so it is being referred to as a 'he' for now. The cute animal was born at an aquarium and staff realised it had the problem when he was around three weeks old. After six weeks of treatment, the little creature's legs are back to the usual position . Once staff at the Sea Life Centre in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, realised the chick had a deformity, they began wrapping its legs in tight fitting trousers made from an elasticated material . He will be able to live with the rest of the colony in about a week's time. Lyndsey Crawford, spokeswoman from the Sea Life Centre, said: 'Splayed legs is a common issue with many bird species. 'Their growth is so rapid it can result in a permanent disability unless treated quickly. 'It was a result of some over-zealous parenting by first-time mum and dad Pinky and Kev, basically they sat on him a bit too heavily. 'The tailored trousers applied just enough pressure to gently squeeze his legs together as he continued to grow. Staff at the sea life centre believe the deformity was caused by the parents sitting on it too heavily. The chick is pictured here with its mother . This is the tape used to make the special elasticated trousers which have been worn for at least six weeks . 'We have sat him in a shallow pot to help keep his legs in the right position and gradually correct his posture. 'He . has stayed with his parents throughout his unusual therapy and they . have continued to feed him, unfazed by his extraordinary leg plumage. 'They . are very social birds, greeting each other every morning and . reinforcing the bond between them with regular bill tapping and mutual . preening. 'The chick is expected to emerge to meet its extended family properly in about a week's time. 'It won't be fully initiated until he is able to join them for their underwater formation swims a few weeks after that though. 'It may have had a wobbly start to life with his legs, but we don't expect any problems with his water wings.' Humboldt penguins are listed as endangered in Peru as the number of breeding pairs has decreased significantly in recent years. Humboldt penguins are named after the cold current of water running from the Antarctic to the equator along the west coast of South America. They originate from coastal Peru and Chile, but the population is currently undergoing a serious decline and estimates suggest there may be only 10,000 left, making them an endangered species. Over-fishing of . prey species, entanglement in fishing nets and commercial guano . removal are thought to have contributed to this. The medium-sized penguins have black backs and tails, and a black band across the chest that runs down the body beneath the flippers to the black feet. They grow to around 18 inch tall and can live up to 30 years in captivity. The penguins have adapted in many ways to a life in the ocean and they even have a special gland that enables them to drink sea water as well as fresh water.

Pope Francis used his weekly public audience today to thank well wishers for their prayers and condolences after two of his great-nephews died in a car crash yesterday. The great-nephews, one aged two, the other aged just eight months, died along with their mother after their car hit the back of a grain truck in Argentina yesterday. Francis's nephew Emanuel Bergoglio, who was driving the car, has been taken to hospital where he is in serious condition. Pope Francis has used his weekly public audience today to thank well wishers for their prayers a day after two of his great-nephews were killed in a car crash yesterday . Francis listened to tributes from priests speaking in different languages before giving his thanks . The Pope made his appearance today despite losing two of his great-nephews in a car crash yesterday . Today Francis listened as priests wished him well in several languages before thanking them, saying 'even the Pope has a family.' DYN news agency said the accident happened shortly after midnight when Mr Begoglio's car slammed into the back of a truck carrying grains. The news came after Francis revealed he may only have two or three years left to live in a news conference on his way home from South Korea. Speaking on a plane after his first trip to Asia, the Pope said he believed he only had limited time left to complete his reforms of the Roman Catholic Church. Asked about how he copes with his popularity, he said: ‘I try to think of my sins, my mistakes, so as not to think that I am some- body important.’ He then added: ‘Because I know this is going to last a short time, two or three years and then… to the house of the Father.’ The children, aged two and eight months, died along with their mother when the car they were in hit the back of a grain truck. The Pope's nephew, Emanuel Bergoglio, who was driving, is still in hospital . Francis also revealed that he believes he only has two or three more years to live while travelling back from his visit to South Korea (pictured) According to a Vatican source, the 77-year-old has previously told those close to him that he thought he only had a few years left. He also revealed that he would consider retiring if he felt he could no longer perform his duties. His predecessor Pope Benedict XVI resigned in February last year. ‘If you asked me if, in the future, I felt I could not go forward, would I do the same? I would do the same. Benedict has opened a door,’ Francis said on board the papal plane. The conference marked the end of his trip to South Korea, which he had been touring since Thursday. He also admitted that his advisers have been encouraging him to rest more after he cancelled a series of engagements earlier in the year.","Pope Francis has thanked those who sent prayers and condolences .

"By . Chris Pleasance for MailOnline . A student who became infatuated with his singing teacher while she taught him Celine Dion's My Heart Will Go On has been given an indefinite restraining order against her. Aspiring singer Ashley Formby, 27, sent teacher Helen Sedgwick, 26, flowers, cards, romantic emails and a model of the Titanic after falling in love with her during their one-on-one music lessons. A court heard that Formby began messaging Miss Sedgwick in March saying he wanted to be her lover, not her pupil, and calling her 'the most beautiful girl in the world.' Ashley Formby, 27, has been given an indefinite restraining order against Helen Sedgwick, 26, after he became infatuated with her while she gave him one-on-one signing lessons . However, Ms Sedgwick shunned his advances, and after continually being bombarded with love letters, emails and gifts, reported him to police for stalking. The court heard that Miss Sedgwick rejected Formby's advances, but after he continued sending her cards and emails she called the police . Prosecutor Sharon Anderson told Llandrindod Wells magistrates court: 'Formby sent her flowers, gifts, emails and texts declaring his love for her. 'Ms Sedgwick responded telling him she was not interested in his approaches and found them inappropriate. 'But he continued to contact her, the tone of these new emails caused her anxiety and she was worried he’d attended her address. He told her he loved her.' Eventually Miss Sedgwick took out a harrassment notice against Formby, but for the next 12 weeks he sent her her eight emails, a romantic card, three texts, and turned up at her home with flowers. Formby was interviewed by officers and told them he felt he had a 'special bond' with Ms Sedgwick and that he had been 'devastated' when she rejected him. Josie Flicker, defending, said: 'He doesn’t threaten violence, he is quite eloquent and shows genuine emotion. But he became quite childish when she rejected his advances. 'Since his arrest there has been no repetition, he seems to have heeded the warning from police.' Formby admitted pursuing a course of harassment. He was given a 12 month community order. He was also given an indefinite restraining order meaning he must not contact Ms Sedgwick in any way. Formby was also ordered to pay £85 costs and a £60 victim surcharge.","Ashley Formby, 27, fell in love with Helen Sedgwick, 26, during lessons .

A farmer who caught national attention after shooting a burglar dead at his house in 1999 says he will not move back to his former home because he fears he could kill again. Tony Martin became a household name after he killed 16-year-old Fred Barras and seriously injured Brendan Fearon, then 28, with a shotgun after the pair broke into his farmhouse. Martin was originally convicted of murder, causing national controversy, but in 2001 the charge was reduced to manslaughter and his sentence was cut to five years by the Appeal Court. Scroll down for video . Tony Martin, the farmer who became a household name after shooting a burglar dead at his house in 1999, has said he won't move back home because he fears he could do it again (file pic) Mr Martin was jailed for life in 2000 for the murder of Fred Barras, 16, at this farm in Norfolk causing nation outcry. In 2001 the charge was reduced to manslaughter and in 2003 he was released . Yesterday he said he has still not moved back into his former home at Emneth because he fears history may repeat itself. He said: 'If I was in Bleak House and someone came in again, then I'm not going to just stand there and let him hurt me. I'm going to act. 'That's one of the reasons I don't want to go back there, because it could happen again.' Mr Martin added that he has been living with friends and in hotels since his release from prison in 2003, and blasted his original sentence as 'preposterous'. He said: 'The whole thing that happened to me in simple terms is preposterous. I don't think I'll ever go back and live at Bleak House. 'I have been down the farm this morning and I had a walk around the garden to cut a few roses. I wouldn't call this place a home anymore, it is just a place to visit. It is a time that place forgot. 'I looked at it last night and it is encased in steel and flooded with water. It looks like the Everglades. 'I just live anywhere, I sleep anywhere. If I go up north to a farm show then I will just stay in my car. I live a little bit like Bonnie Prince Charlie and go from place to place. I have very kind friends.' Mr Martin also called for the legalisation of guns and said there need to be tougher laws allowing people to protect their homes. His comments come a week after law professor Paul Kohler, 55, was savagely beaten on the doorstep of his Wimbledon home after tackling four masked raiders. Mr Martin also called for the legalisation of guns, saying that people should have an 'infallible' right to protect themselves in their own homes . He also spoke about the case of law professor Paul Kohler who was savagely beaten as he defended his house in Wimbledon, saying if the law professor had a gun 'things would have been different' Mr Kohler was left with a face covered in bruises after the attack and fears for the sight in one of his eyes after the attack. Speaking about the case, Mr Martin said: 'I think it is just hypocrisy that a man can't go to any length to protect himself. You need to be safe in your own house with impunity. 'That law professor who got beaten up in his own home, if he had something like a gun in that house he could have picked it up and things would have been different.' 20 August 1999: Police are called to remote Bleak House in Emneth Hungate, Norfolk, after 16-year-old Fred Barras is shot dead. Brendan Fearon,28, his friend and accomplice, is taken to hospital with wounds to his legs. 23 August 1999: Martin, 54, is charged with murdering Mr Barras and wounding Fearon with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. 10 January 2000: Fearon admits conspiring to burgle Bleak House, accompanied by Fred Barras.

"By . Chris Pleasance for MailOnline . About two dozen heavily armed police officers stormed a home in Chicago's southern suburbs Wednesday to free four remaining hostages and capture two suspects, ending a standoff that lasted more than 20 hours. The two women and two children, ages 6 and 12, still being held at the home in the small city of Harvey were freed midmorning without a shot being fired, said Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart. Footage shot by a TV news helicopter showed officers with armor, shields and rifles sweeping in through the front door as other officers aimed weapons and took cover near two large armored vehicles that were parked out front. Scroll down for video . Good news: Harvey, Ill., Mayor Eric J. Kellogg, left, and city spokesman Sean Howard, center, accompany Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart at a news conference to address the release of four hostages after a 21-hour standoff . Officers ran out of the house with the remaining hostages then brought out two men in handcuffs. Dart said negotiators were in 'constant contact' with the hostage-takers throughout the night and into the morning until a decision was made to storm the house. Officers found the hostages on the second floor. They were unharmed. 'We were able to take everyone down without any injuries to anybody and without shots being fired,' Dart said. The tense standoff began after two police officers were shot while responding to reports of a burglary at a home in Harvey, a small suburb of Chicago, at 12.48pm yesterday. The two suspected robbers took two women - one of them a nurse - and six children hostage at the house on West 147th Street and Robey Avenue, but later released four of the youngsters. One woman and two children were being held hostage by two men in a Chicago suburb after police interrupted a suspected armed burglary yesterday, according to a police spokesman (pictured) The two men initially held six children but released one after learning he had a breathing problem. They then released another three over the course of the evening . Two officers were shot after responding to calls of a burglary in progress. Darnell Keel, who has served with Harvey police for 18 years, suffered a broken arm while another officer received a graze wound . One child who has a breathing problem was released at around 6:30pm, another around 30 minutes later and a 1-year-old was let out at around 7:45 pm . Finally, at 10.30pm, the suspects released a four child, believed to be another one-year-old, according to NBC Chicago. Officers initially believed that there were only five children in the house, but after interviewing an 11-year-old that had been let out they discovered that there were six children in total. Darnell Keel, an 18-year veteran of the Harvey police force, suffered a broken arm after an exchange of gunfire with the suspects, while a second officer suffered a graze wound. Mr Keel was treated in hospital but was released on Tuesday evening and is expected to have surgery at some point today, police said.

The 31 year old was due to face a sentence hearing in the Downing Centre district court on Thursday, but the matter . was adjourned until October. Scroll down for video . The son of late underworld figure George Freeman has been taken into custody before being sentenced for his involvement in the manufacture of $3 million worth of ecstasy. Freeman did not apply for bail. 'Bail is no longer applied for therefore, it is refused,' Judge Chris Hoy said. Freeman was extradited from Thailand in August 2011 after a global arrest warrant was issued. In December, 2010, he fled to Bangkok, a day after two of his co-acused were arrested in New South Wales near Tamworth, over 20 kilograms of precursor drugs used at make esctasy. The two men were busted after they were apparently pulled over for an RBT and officers noticed drugs and drug manufacturing equipment in their hire van. Analysis of glass vases in the van found they contained fingerprints including those of Freeman's, the court heard previously. Farmer Gary Rennolds told the hearing he was promised $50,000 for letting three men use his shearing shed for about three weeks in late 2010. Freeman's DNA was found on a cigarette butt at the shed. He will be sentenced on October 27 for manufacturing a commercial quantity of ecstasy, worth an estimated $3 million. Adam Freeman was arrested at the weekend after a man fell 10 metres from a balcony in Bondi . Earlier this month Freeman was arrested over the alleged assault of a man who fell from a balcony in North Bondi. Mr Freeman was taken to Waverley Police Station after police were called to an apartment on Brighton Boulevard just before 10am. Police arrived at the North Bondi property to find a 29-year-old man had fallen 10 metres from the balcony of the apartment. 'At the scene they found a 29-year-old man with face and spinal injuries,' a police statement said. 'The man was treated at the scene by paramedics and taken to hospital.' The 29-year-old victim was taken St Vincents Hospital in Darlinghurst with head injuries. A spokesperson for NSW Police told Daily Mail Australia that a '31-year-old has since been released pending further enquiry and no charges had been laid at this point'. Freeman is well-known on the Kings Cross club scene and once owned the now defunct nightclub Lady Lux, with nightclub owner, John Ibrahim. Scroll down for video . The 29-year-old who tumbled from the balcony was taken to St Vincent's Hospital with face and spinal injuries . The Thailand trip the senior officer was referring to occurred on December 16, 2010, when Freeman paid cash for a one-way ticket out of Australia after two of his co-accused were busted with 20 kilograms of precursor drugs used to make ecstasy. The two men were apparently pulled over for an RBT and were driving a hired van when police discovered the drugs. Freeman handed himself into authorities in Sydney on August 6 2011 after a global warrant was issued for his arrest. Freeman, 31, spent time in Klong Prem Prison in 2010 before he returned to Australian after a global warrant was issued for his arrest . Before returning to Sydney he spend 30 days inside the notorious Klong Prem Prison, known as the 'Bangkok Hilton', . In September 2013 - after spending some time in Long Bay Jail later in 2011 but being released on $860,000 bail - he pleaded guilty to manufacturing a commercial supply to ecstasy just days before his trial was due to start. He could face up to 25 years behind bars on the drug charges. The self-confessed drug manufacturer dated swimsuit model Dominique Le Toullec, who is said to have visited him in Thailand back in 2010 . Freeman's latest brush with the law comes after he was on the luxury Oscar II boat in Rose Bay when it was shot up early in January. Also on board were alleged Brothers for Life gang members Farhad Qaumi, his brother Mumtaz and another man, Fawad Bari, who was allegedly a member of the Blacktown chapter. The Daily Telegraph report the men were on the boat with a group of women as part of a 'send-off' for Freeman due to his impending sentencing. Adam Freeman's father George Freeman was a notorious organised crime figure and featured in two seasons of Underbelly . The yacht was docked at the time of the attack and police sources said the hit was organised by some of the men who were on board the boat. Farhad Qaumi was hit in the shoulder during the shooting. Freeman previously dated Dominique Le Toullec, whose Facebook page describes her as 'Personal Trainer - International/Australian Glamour & Fitness Model'. She is believed to have visited him when he was holed up in Thailand, though had no link to any of her boyfriend's crimes. Le Toullec recently spent some time in the US to watch the Surf Open and take part in some photoshoots. It is unclear if the pair are still an item. The boy's father George Freeman is one of Australia's most famous organised crime figures, who was a one time bookie and illegal casino operator. He served some time in jail during the 50s and 60s, had links to the drug trade in the 70s and 80s, and was later named in an organised crime Royal Commission. George Freeman's life has been detailed in two of the Underbelly series' that aired on Channel Nine, which implied his involvement in an international drug syndicate and the unsolved murder of another criminal. He survived an attempt on his life in 1970 when he was shot in the neck but died 11 years later from an asthma attack and heart failure when his eldest son was just eight.

"By . Chris Pleasance for MailOnline . Abdul Hanif, 30, from Bradford, has been sentenced to 17 years in jail after being found guilty of keeping a woman as a sex slave . A McDonald's worker has been found guilty of keeping a student as a sex slave for four months  while repeatedly raping and beating her. Abdul Hanif, 30, from Bradford, also planned to force his victim into prostitution to help repay his gambling debts. He was today sentenced to 17 years in jail at Bradford Crown Court after being found guilty of three charges of rape and one of causing actual bodily harm. During his trail, the jury at Bradford Crown Court heard that Hanif's 26-year-old victim was a virgin before he kidnapped and raped her. Jurors were told that the female student had moved to London from Bangladesh to study accountancy. She first met Hanif in February when she was working in a sandwich shop in London and he 'began to groom her', the judge said. The pair exchanged numbers, and after the woman was made homeless Hanif offered to take her to 'a nice new home' in Bradford. In reality the pair spent several days sleeping in Hanif's car and moving between his friends' flats before he moved her to a rented apartment. During this time Hanif took away her credit cards and mobile phone, effectively making her a prisoner, while forcing her to have sex with him every day. The victim said she was made to cook his meals, adding that he would fly into a rage if he was unhappy with what she served. She said Hanif wanted to use her as a prostitute to pay off his gambling debts, and when she refused he tore a phone charger from the wall and strangled her, leaving marks on her throat. She was only freed after managing to contact one of Hanif's former friends, Stephen Naylor, saying she was unwell and had been the victim of domestic violence. He alerted police who went to Hanif's flat in June last year where they battered down the door and found the victim inside. Mr Naylor told the court: 'She said he was treating her like an animal.' He described Hanif as 'charismatic' but added: 'He is a very frightening man and he trusts no-one.' The court heard the victim has had to seek help with counselling after suffering from depression, flashbacks and suicidal thoughts as a result of the treatment she suffered at the hands of Hanif. In a victim impact statement read out to the court, she said: 'I feel as if my life is totally ruined because of what Abdul Hanif did to me. 'Everything in my life has now changed. I can't smile or go anywhere like I could before.' The jury convicted Hanif after just 90 minutes of deliberations following his trial. Jailing him, Judge Peter Benson said: 'Your victim was a young woman who came to London where she had no family and a limited number of friends and she struggled to find her feet. Bradford Crown Court (pictured) heard that Hanif had groomed the student while she worked in a sandwich shop in London. When she became homeless he offered her a place to stay before making her a prisoner . 'You seized this opportunity and lied to her and pretended you had found her a home owned by a friend. Instead of that you brought her against her will to Bradford and when she realised you were leaving London you frightened her and told her you would abandon her. 'This was a young lady who was virtually alone in a big foreign country. You wickedly exploited that vulnerability. You forced her into having sex against her will and when she refused you struck her and threatened her. 'You used her as a sexual resource and you controlled her and isolated her by restricting the use of her phone and locking her in. 'You took her bank card so you had control of her finances, such as they were, and you repeatedly raped her on an almost daily basis using no contraception. 'You treated her like a slave and went off to work, taking the only key. She was a prisoner and had no life at all as you made her cook and clean for you. 'You humiliated her by rejecting the food she cooked  while you satisfied your sexual appetite. 'Eventually when you had gambled away any money that you had, you offered her to a friend for sexual purposes but you then threatened to turn her into a prostitute for funds to feed your gambling addiction. Your threats to turn her into a prostitute finally caused her to find the courage to escape.' Detective Constable Brett Carter, of Protective Services at West Yorkshire Police, said: 'Hanif befriended his victim when she was vulnerable, but then went on to repeatedly rape and assault her. 'This must have been a harrowing ordeal for her and we would like to thank her for the courage she has shown in coming forward and reporting Hanif's crimes. 'We hope the sentence which has been passed down on him today will be of some comfort to her and will help to give her some closure. 'We also hope it will encourage other victims of sexual abuse to speak to our specially-trained officers, who will investigate all reports, no matter how historic, sensitively and thoroughly with the aim of securing a conviction against offenders.' Hanif was also ordered to sign the sex offences register for life.","Abdul Hanif jailed for 17 years after being found guilty of rape and ABH .

"By . Reuters Reporter . The injury sustained by Manchester United defender Luke Shaw was caused by too many training sessions from new manager Louis van Gaal, former Wales assistant coach Raymond Verheijen said on Thursday. England left back Shaw, signed from Southampton in the summer for £27million, may be out for a month with a hamstring problem and will definitely miss the start of the Premier League campaign at home to Swansea City on Saturday. Verheijen called fellow Dutchman Van Gaal a 'great appointment' by United but at the same time accused the former Netherlands manager of incompetence and of working his players too hard. Incompetent: Raymond Verheijen believes Louis van Gaal (left) is to blame for Luke Shaw's (right) injury . Hampered: Shaw (top) will miss the start of Manchester United's season with a hamstring complaint . 'What LVG proves is that top coaches are not perfect. Even the world's best have deficiencies,' Verheijen said on his Twitter feed. 'LVG is tactically superior to most other coaches but planning & periodisation is not his strongest point: double sessions & muscle injuries,' added the Dutchman, an expert on football fitness and a frequent critic of the methods of top coaches. 'The Luke Shaw case is the climax of Manchester United's predictable pre-season injury crisis due to ""too much training too soon"".' Running freely? Shaw (left) could be out for a month following his hamstring injury . Too much, too soon? Verheijen believes United's extra training sessions were the cause of Shaw's injury . Verheijen questioned why Shaw, 19, cut short his post-World Cup break and said he reported back for pre-season training too early. Van Gaal accused the left back of being unfit on their pre-season tour of the United States. 'Luke Shaw had to do extra training to get fit. Who was in charge of his individual programme?,' asked Verheijen. 'LVG's coaching skills & tactical superiority often compensate for this periodisation deficiency but there is clearly room for improvement.' Winning smile: Shaw (centre) was part of United's pre-season squad that won the Intentional Champions Cup . Verheijen suggested Van Gaal's methods were responsible for a spate of injuries among the Dutch players before and during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, a tournament where they finished third. 'During the World Cup preparation the Dutch players had to do frequent double sessions so not surprisingly the muscle injuries accumulated,' he said. 'At Man United, in the first few weeks, LVG has applied the same approach and, as expected, with the same result. Culpable: Verheijen says van Gaal's training methods were responsible for injuries whilst Holland boss . 'But who is gonna tell a top coach that he has to raise his bar in a certain area? The 'yes-men' in his coaching staff? Journalists? Who...?'

"By . Simon Jones for Daily Mail . Manchester United are poised to splash out £80million to turn Louis van Gaal’s squad into Premier League contenders. United have revived their interest in £50million-rated Real Madrid winger Angel di Maria, launched a bid for Sporting Lisbon defender Marcos Rojo and are keen on Ajax utility player Daley Blind. Executive vice chairman Ed Woodward was understood to be in Cardiff for the UEFA Super Cup between Real Madrid and Sevilla ahead of talks with Madrid for the Argentina international Di Maria, considered by United manager Van Gaal as one of the best wingers in the world. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Rojo hands in transfer request . Wanted: Man Utd have revived their interest in £50m-rated winger Angel di Maria .

VIDEO Rojo hands in transfer request . Reunited? And the Dutchman also wants Daley Blind, who played under him at the World Cup . Mover: Van Gaal is hoping to splash the cash to turn United into contenders again . Madrid have already priced him out of a move to Paris Saint-Germain after demanding £50m, but United hope to strike a more reasonable deal. Should they succeed it will be the third time of asking after former bosses Sir Alex Ferguson and David Moyes each tried to sign the 26-year-old. Woodward missed Van Gaal’s first match at Old Trafford on Tuesday night where United beat Valencia 2-1 with under-pressure midfielder Marouane Fellaini scoring the late winner. Wayne Rooney was named captain for the night, but blotted his copybook by slamming a first-half penalty against a post. Finally: Marouane Fellaini celebrates scoring for Manchester United against Valencia . Ruffled: The midfield man could be given a chance at Old Trafford despite interest from Napoli . Meanwhile Di Maria’s Argentina team-mate Rojo refused to train at Sporting Lisbon on Tuesday and has asked to leave the club now United have declared their interest. Southampton have already had a £9.5m offer rejected and, despite third party ownership involvement, United don’t envisage problems signing the versatile defender — although Sporting will play hard-ball and want closer to £18m. Dutch international Blind is valued at £15m by Ajax, but has already admitted he was flattered by interest from United and Barcelona. Lining one up: Wayne Rooney missed a penalty against Valencia . Dejection: The forward puts his head in his hands after slamming the ball against the post . Although he has reservations about whether he is physically suited to the Premier League, Blind has unswerving faith in his former national coach Van Gaal. The new United boss is also willing to give Marouane Fellaini a chance to prove he can stake a claim for United’s holding midfield role. Despite talks at the weekend between the two, Van Gaal has told the Belgian he will take a closer look at him before allowing the 26-year-old to leave Old Trafford. Although Napoli have expressed an interest they want United to subsidise a loan rather than buy the player outright.","Manchester United poised to spend £80m to become title contenders .

"By . Sam Cunningham . Follow @@samcunningham . Arsenal swept aside Barclays Premier League holders Manchester City in the Community Shield to send a warning to their title rivals that they mean business this season. The Gunners were top for almost the entire first half of the last campaign but eventually finished well off the pace. Here,Sportsmail brings you five reason why they can go all the way this year. SUPER SANCHEZ . Arsenal's new £30million man Alexis Sanchez is the latest gem, full of class and elegance and technique to match, at Arsene Wenger's disposal. He may have played only 45 minutes against City, but the plucky Chilean showed glimpses of what Arsenal fans can expect from him this season. Sanchez can play anywhere across the front line and will cause havoc for defences across the country with his adeptness at switching flanks or playing through the middle. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arteta lift Community Shield and Chambers' initiation song . Danger man: Summer signing Alexis Sanchez (centre) has the potential to light up the Premier League . OZIL RETURNS . Mesut Ozil had an indifferent debut season at Arsenal following his £42.5million move from Real Madrid last summer. Like the club, he started the campaign strongly but faded towards the end. Fresh from winning the World Cup with Germany, if Ozil can carry that confidence into his second season in north London then he could well become one of the stars of the league. No-one doubts that the forward has the ability to become Arsenal's attacking fulcrum and it will make them one of the most dangerous teams in the league if he fulfils that potential. Fresh start: Mesut Ozil should be full of confidence after helping Germany win the World Cup in Brazil . VIDEO German trio to miss start of season - Wenger . ATTACKING OPTIONS . Wenger was going weak at the knees about his attacking options after they hit three past City on Sunday. Not only have they spent more than £70m on Sanchez and Ozil in the past year, they have welcomed back Joel Campbell from his loan spells and after his displays at the World Cup for Costa Rica and at Olympiacos last season he is like another signing. They've added to Olivier Giroud, Lukas Podolski, Santi Cazorla, Aaron Ramsey, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Theo Walcott, Jack Wilshere and Tomas Rosicky to create a frightening choice of attacking options. Option: The return of Joel Campell (right) from a loan spell will improve the Gunners' attack . After the Community Shield victory Wenger said: 'Three, four, five years ago we lost a big player every year. In the last two years we’ve added players, like Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez. I have more attacking options than I’ve had for a long time.' BIG GAME MENTALITY . Arsenal ultimately came undone by their inability to perform well against the top sides last season. They were on the receiving end of some humiliating defeats – a 6-3 loss to City, a 6-0 hammering by Chelsea and a 5-1 demolition by Liverpool. Ramsey admitted after the Community Shield: 'In these games last season we have been guilty of conceding early on. It's difficult enough so it was important today for us to stay in the game, wait for them to open up, and we capitalised on that. Room for improvement: Aaron Ramsey believes Arsenal are ready to perform against the league's big teams . 'We’re more than capable - the team has a good team spirit. We need to improve on the big games so hopefully now we’ve learnt our lesson, we can go into this season and have a good go.' His manager agreed with him. 'Last year we were very consistent against teams outside the top six and not consistent against top-six teams,' Wenger said. 'The year before it was the reverse. It’s hoped that this year it will be right on both sides.' Get that right and they will be one of the favourites to lift the title. DEFENSIVE CHAMBERS . Wenger threw young defender Calum Chambers in at the deep end playing in the centre of defence – having played last season as right back for Southampton – against one of the best attacks in the country. He was one of best players on the pitch. Chambers' reading of the game makes him a ideal at the heart of the defence and Wenger has already told the player he will trial him at centre back or possibly as a defensive midfielder. He is still only 19 but, following his £12m move, has already been talked about as having the potential to emulate Tony Adams at the north London club. Bright future: Summer signing Calum Chambers can play at both right-back and centre-back . Wenger described his display against City as 'outstanding' and hinted that Chambers could be first-choice centre back this season. If the Frenchman has unearthed another Adams, they will have one of the most formidable defences in the league to match their attack.","Arsenal comfortably beat title holders Manchester City 3-0 in the Community Shield at Wembley on Sunday .

"By . Rob Davies, City Correspondent . The days of memorising long passwords and answering tedious security questions when calling your bank could soon be over. Barclays is unveiling a voice recognition system that it claims will slash the time it takes to access your account from 90 seconds to just ten. The ‘foolproof’ software works by taking a recording of a customer’s voice when they sign up, which is then stored in a secure database. Hi-tech: The software will slash the time it takes to gain access to your account information from 90 seconds to just ten.

This is because the technology is so sophisticated . it can pick up imperceptible quirks in how someone breathes or the . speed at which they say certain words.

"By . Lara Gould . It was almost a case of deja vu. An overweight, badly dressed contestant lumbers awkwardly on to the Britain’s Got Talent stage, prompting the judges to roll their eyes at the inevitable car-crash of a performance to follow . . . only to be wowed by the powerful, pitch-perfect voice of the unlikely star. But although producers might hope Jonathan Antoine becomes a global phenomenon in the mould of Susan Boyle, the painfully shy teenager was keen to distance himself from any such comparisons. ‘What I don’t want is to be roped into a category with other people,’ he told The Mail on Sunday, before his performance aired on the first show of the new series last night. Scroll down for video... Star Quality: Jonathan Antoine and schoolfriend Charlotte Jaconelli impress the BGT judges but there are fears over Jonathan's state of mind after he suffered a nervous breakdown . But he added: ‘I wasn’t too worried about appearing on Britain’s Got Talent, because I wanted to show people the singing. 'If anything I was hoping that because I don’t look like a typical person who’d be in the limelight, it would help. I’d like to show that a person is more than a body.’ It is a message the 17-year-old  A-level student from Ilford, Essex, is keen to spread, as just three months before his audition, he suffered a nervous breakdown triggered by bullying over his weight. He said: ‘Back in October I had a nervous breakdown. At that point I left the school I was at; me and school just don’t get on.’ Low confidence: Charlotte calms her friend's nerves before his audition. He has been bullied at school about his weight . Hitting all the right notes:  Jonathan and Charlotte sing during the latest London auditions for BGT, safely making it through to the next round of the talent show . Praise: Jonathan and Charlotte receive a standing ovation from the audience and judges after a stunning performance of Celine Dion and Andrea Bocelli¿s hit The Prayer . The revelation could raise questions about the ITV series, which has previously drawn criticism for failing to look after vulnerable acts, such as Ms Boyle who was admitted to the Priory clinic after suffering a breakdown when she came second in the series final three years ago. But for the moment, Jonathan says: ‘Britain’s Got Talent has been a fun experience to do and it’s been nice to be around all these people. ‘But I’ve also been seeing a psychiatrist and so I’m just on a really good road to somewhere. Britain’s Got Talent have been very helpful.’ Show sources said Jonathan passed all medical and psychological tests before appearing. While on the programme, Jonathan spoke of his difficulties with bullies, saying: ‘I’ve always had problems with my size ever since I can remember. Thrilled: Music mogul Simon Cowell told the teenage hopeful he was a 'future star' with 'an outstandingly good voice' Ant and Dec join in the fun and build up Jonathan as he arrives back stage after his impressive rendition of the difficult song . 'When I was in primary school, I had the mick taken out of me and it kind of damaged my confidence quite a bit and when people would say something to me it would take a little piece out of me.’ But his confidence would surely have been boosted by the standing ovation he won for his show-stopping performance of Celine Dion and Andrea Bocelli’s hit The Prayer with schoolfriend Charlotte Jaconelli. An estimated  nine million viewers last night saw judge Alesha Dixon describe it as ‘world class’, and show guru Simon Cowell say: ‘Jonathan, you are unbelievable. I mean seriously you have an outstandingly good voice. You are a future star.’ Incredibly, Jonathan says he only discovered his singing potential four years ago, after his voice broke and he began taking singing lessons. He now attends the Royal College of Music in London one day a week. Jonathan is keen to avoid any comparisons to Susan Boyle, left in one of her first auditions when she took the world by storm and right, wearing a black frock after she became famous . He is also full of praise for his singing partner, a 16-year-old student at the Arts Educational school in Chiswick, West London. ‘Charlotte’s been a really big help to me in terms of confidence and becoming a better performer,’ he said. ‘I really don’t think I’d be on stage today if I didn’t have Charlotte by my side.’ Discovering an unlikely new singing sensation will do nothing to harm Britain’s Got Talent’s chances in the ratings battle brewing with BBC1’s £22 million talent show, The Voice UK, which also launched last night. In an apparent dig at Cowell’s approach, The Voice presenter  Reggie Yates said before the showdown: ‘I think that as a country of television fans we’re past that humiliation thing.’ His show’s twist is that the judges – Tom Jones, Jessie J, Danny O’Donoghue and Will.i.am – cannot see the singer perform, so make their decision based on vocal ability alone.

"By . Lucy Crossley . A bookmaker's have accused television insiders and friends in the know of betting on the outcome of the eagerly anticipated Great British Bake Off after a flurry of bets were placed on 'outsider' Frances Quinn. Bookies Coral were left badly burned by the bets on eventual winner Miss Quinn, who had been backed at just 5-2 when betting opened after last week's semi final. However, the odds for the 31-year-old quickly rose to 11-10, making her favourite, after punters rushed to back her. Pay out: Bookmaker's coral were forced to close its Great British Bake Off book after a flurry of bets were placed on 'outsider' Frances Quinn, prompting fears of television insiders placing wagers on the outcome . Fearing insiders had been betting on the pre-recorded BBC Two show, Coral were forced to suspend the book after 90 per cent of wagers favoured Miss Quinn. The children's clothing designer had been seen as an outsider to take the top prize, as judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood regularly criticised her spectacular creations as a victory for 'style over substance'. Her rival Kimberley Wilson, 30, had been favourite to be named champion, having been initially given odds of 11-8. However, Miss Quinn saw off Ms Wilson and 21-year-old Ruby Tandoh, who had been backed at 6-4, thanks to her rainbow-style savoury picnic pie and show stopper three-tier wedding cake, inspired by the Shakespearean play A Midsummer Night's Dream. Tuesday night's final was watched by more than nine million viewers. Rising odds: Frances was initially the 5-2 outsider, but her odds quicky rose to 11-10 making her the firm favourite . 'We were the only bookmaker to actually take bets on Great British Bake Off after last week’s semi-final, and we did so knowing that as the show was pre-recorded someone somewhere would know the outcome, so we always kept stakes quite low, but that didn’t stop plenty of people getting their bets on before we took the decision to suspend betting because more than 90 per cent of bets taken were for Frances,' said Coral’s David Stevens. 'Kimberley Wilson, the original 11-8 favourite, and Paul Hollywood’s favourite, Ruby Tandoh, 6-4 second favourite, hardly attracted a bet between them, and their odds drifted to 2-1 and 3-1 respectively. 'Most of the bets were placed online, many from new customers, and we face a four figure payout now Frances has been crowned champion, so it’s fair to say we have had our fingers burned by this Bake Off. Final three: Frances, pictured second from right, with her fellow Bake Off finalists and judges, from left, Ruby Tandoh, Mary Berry, Kimberley Wilson and Paul Hollywood . 'However we have no complaints as there was always a risk attached to betting on a non-live show, and for those who backed Frances, her victory really was the icing on the cake.' Mr Stevens said that Coral had not contacted police about the insider fears, but said that the bookmaker was unsure if bets would be taken on next year's show - which is due to move to BBC One due to its popularity. He added: 'We have lost a few thousand but we take that on the chin, it's been good fun and we have maybe learned our lesson. 'We will see what we do about it next year.' A BBC spokesman said the broadcaster would not be commenting on the claims.","Coral closed Bake Off book after 90 per cent of bets backed Frances Quinn .

"By . Mark Duell . These extraordinary pictures show how a series of blasts from exploding shells rocked a Russian military test site today and released giant clouds of smoke over a city. The explosions broke windows and released smoke over Orenburg near the Kazakhstan border, with one military officer taken to hospital - but no other injuries reported. The enormous blasts were set off by a fire that may have been caused by someone smoking at the Donguz test site, military prosecutor Yevgeny Ivanov told state television. Scroll down for video . Blast: Smoke from an explosion rises outside Orenburg after explosions rocked a Russian military test site .

More than 4,000 tons of ammunition exploded - including aviation bombs and rockets, local reports said. Military officials have opened a criminal investigation into the suspected mishandling of weapons. All 300 people working in the area fled after the fire broke out - just before the explosions - and 10,000 inhabitants from two local towns were evacuated, reported the International Business Times. 'Commander issued an order to leave the premises,' a witness told Russian newspaper Izvestia. 'We dropped everything and fled. Otherwise all the 300 people would have been killed.'

"By . Sara Nathan . The Church of Scientology has vehemently denied extraordinary claims that their leader David Miscavige called Nicole Kidman a gold digger who had faked her conversion to the religion. In a new book, Pulitzer Prize winning author Lawrence Wright alleges the comments were made about the 45-year-old actress when she was married to Scientology devotee Tom Cruise. He goes on to claim that Miscavige had described her as a ‘suppressive’ person and was hopeful that the actor, now 50, could be ‘peeled away' from her.' Both the Church and Miscavige have issued a robust denial of the allegations made in Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood & the Prison of Belief, which will by published by Knopf on January 17 with a reported print run of 150,000 copies. Love life: The book claims Scientology boss David Miscavige went to extreme lengths to keep Cruise and Nicole Kidman happy when the pair were married . Allegations: Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood & the Prison of Belief by Lawrence Wright will be published on January 17 . A British version of the book has been cancelled after publisher Transworld took legal advice. Karin Poew, a Church representative . said: ‘Wright's book would be better suited for supermarket tabloids . because they are nothing more than a stale rehash of allegations . disproven long ago. ‘It is important to note that Wright's . British publisher had second thoughts, choosing not to publish Wright's . book after being informed of the numerous inaccuracies and defamatory . lies it contains that were told to Wright by a handful of bitter and . discredited former Scientologists.’ Inside Scientology: Author Lawrence Wright . Wright’s highly-anticipated book is . based on his 2011 New Yorker article ‘The Apostate’, for which he . interviewed the screenwriter and director Paul Haggis about his decision . to resign from the organisation. It examines the Church’s founder, L. Ron Hubbard, the church’s finances and its relationships with . celebrities such as Cruise and John Travolta. The first excerpt of the tome, published in  The Hollywood Reporter . this week, alleges that Miscavige attempted to cultivate Cruise to . become a spiritual leader - and was 'bedazzled' by the glamour . surrounding the star, who introduced him to a social life outside . Scientology, including use of his private jet and set visits. In turn, Cruise ploughed millions of . dollars into the church and attempted to lobby foreign leaders - . including former British Prime Minister Tony Blair - to promote . Scientology. The book claims that the actor submitted to hours of . 'auditing'  - where followers are given 'spiritual counselling - in the . run up to his split from Nicole in 2001. It had been previously alleged that . Cruise and Nicole's adopted children Isabella and Conor, both brought up . as devout Scientologists, were told their mother was a 'supressive' person - a spiritually toxic person to be avoided. Members of the Church quietly . instilled this idea into the kids, who were just eight and six at the . time of their parents split,  to try and turn them against Nicole, . sources claimed to Vanity Fair last September. The Church strongly denied the claims, . publishing online an eight-page letter which it sent to the magazine in . which it accused the writer Maureen Orth of ‘shoddy journalism’. Chairman of the Board: Scientology leader David Miscavige addressing the crowd during the opening of the Church of Scientology's new church in the City of London in October 2006 . Happier times: Tom Cruise and ex-wife Katie Holmes seen together at the premiere of his film Knight & Day in Seville, Spain, in June 2010 . After an intensive five days hours of . auditing in October 1998, according to the new book, Cruise 'went quiet' until he and Nicole were in England, filming Eyes Wide Shut. Out of the blue, former Scientologist . and church official Marty Rathbun, who oversaw Cruise's auditing, . received a call from the star in January 2001 asking for help - and . revealing that he and Nicole had split. Cruise's 'renewed dedication' to . Scientology following the breakdown of his near 10-year marriage to . Nicole, resulted in Miscaviage and the actor becoming 'closer than . ever', as the book alleges the church leader flew with Cruise in the . Warner Bros. jet to a test screening of The Last Samurai in Arizona. While in July 2004, Miscavige hosted a . 42nd birthday party for Cruise aboard the Scientology cruise ship . Freewinds, with the book noting: 'Musicians, including Miscavige's . father, played songs from the actor's films as clips played on giant . screens. Cruise himself danced and sang 'Old Time Rock and Roll, . reprising his famous scene from Risky Business.' In Vanity Fair, in 2004, Miscaviage . was alleged to have set up a team to help Cruise find a girlfriend. They . claimed that the church discovered aspiring actress Nazanin Boniadi, a . 25-year-old Iranian-born, London-raised beauty whose mother was also a . Scientologist. It was said that she was given . intensive auditing and security checks by the Church and flown to New . York and Cruise's Colorado estate in Telluride in late 2007 for dates . with the star. Toothbrush: Actress Nazanin Boniadi was allegedly wooed by Tom Cruise . But the brief romance ended when . Nazanin asked Miscavige to repeat himself while they were talking - . which was considered a huge slight . However the Vanity Fair claims were . vehemently denied by Mr Miscavige and the Church who said: ‘The entire . story is hogwash. There was no project, secret or otherwise, ever . conducted by the church to find a bride (audition or otherwise) for any . member of the church.’ Mr Cruise has also poured cold water on these allegations. The latest book claims that she] was . given a 'dressing down' by Cruise for 'disrespecting' the Church leader, . as the book said he told her: 'You don't get it, it goes like this,' Cruise said. He raised his hand over his head. 'First there's LRH ' (L . Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology).He moved his hand down a few . inches. 'Then there is COB' (Chairman of the board, Miscavige). Bringing . his hand down at his own eye level, he said 'Then there's me'. [ADD: . Cruise's attorney has vehemently denied that this exchange took place or . that the Church set him up]. It was only a few months later that . Cruise met Katie Holmes and the pair were married in November 2006 . following the birth of their daughter Suri. Miscavige was Cruise's best . man at the ceremony in Rome. Katie, 34, stunned Cruise by filling . for divorce last June and has since then moved her little girl to New . York City, with reports claiming that she did not want their . six-year-old daughter to grow up in Scientology. The author of the new book is no . stranger to investigating secretive organisations. He won the Pulitzer . Prize in 2007 for his book The Looming Tower: Al-Qaeda and the Road to . 9/11. A field full of a wildflowers and a romantic 'fairy-tale' bungalow made for two: How David Miscavige tried to woo Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman . In the mid 1990s, Scientology leader David Miscavige tried to woo Cruise and his then wife Nicole  Kidman with a 'completely deferential environment as spotless and odorless as a fairy tale', according to Lawrence Wright's book. A romantic bungalow was especially built for the couple at Gold Base, Scientology's desert outpost near Hemet, California. When he heard about Cruise and Nicole's fantasy of running through a field of wildflowers together, Miscavige had Sea Org - whose members dress in military-style uniforms, a throwback to their original purpose as L Ron Hubbard's private navy - to plant a section of the desert with the blooms. When that failed to meet his expectations, the meadow was plowed and sodded with grass. However, former Scientologist Marty Rathbun told how he was against the 'endless courtship' of Cruise - especially after he returned to the Church. Gold base: Scientology's desert base in California . In a bubble: Nicole Kidman said she was heartbroken when she split from Tom Cruise, seen togther at the Oscars in March 2000 . The book claims: 'He told Miscavige 'I think I'm done with this guy.' Miscavige responded: 'He'll he done when he calls me'. Rathbun believes the leader was galled by the fact that Cruise had never contacted him when he came back for counseling.' It adds: 'Miscavige showed his instinctive understanding of how to cater to the sense of entitlement that comes with stardom.' In November, Nicole -now married to country singer Keith Urban with whom she has two young daughters - gave a rare glimpse into her split from Cruise . She married the actor in 1990 when she was just 23 and told DuJour magazine that after their break-up, 'It took me a very long time to heal. It was a shock to my system...I was totally smitten - I fell madly, passionately in love. 'I was reeling with Tom. I would have gone to the ends of the earth for him...I was so impulsive and naïve.' The Australian star added: 'We were in a bubble, just the two of us.' There were hints of why the marriage might have gone wrong after nearly 10 years. Cruise, after all, is the most famous Scientologist in the world. Kidman grew up Catholic and remains devout, saying: 'We were a close-knit family — still are,' adding that she still lives by the Ten Commandments.","New book titled Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood & the Prison of Belief .

"By . Charlie Mccann . It was the BBC programme beloved by children that also gained a cult following from adults. Teletubbies, the pre-school show that ran from 1997 to 2001, was notable for its bright colours, unusual designs, non-verbal dialogue, and highly memorable characters - Tinky Winky, Dipsy, Laa-Laa and Po. But who were the people who brought the quirky creatures to life? Teletubbies, say hello: The pre-school show ran from 1997 to 2001 . Inside the costumes: From left, Nikky Smedley (Laa-Laa), Simon Shelton (Tinky Winky), Pui Fan Lee (Po) and John Simmit (Dipsy) The actors and actresses inside the costumes were tracked down by Buzzfeed to find out who they are and what they are up to now, 12 years on from when the show ended. The largest of the . Teletubbies, handbag carrying Tinky Winky, was played by Simon Shelton, now 47. He is a a trained ballet . dancer and choreographer and admitted he was initially reluctant to take on the role that led to him being sent fan mail from adults as well as children and feeling like a member of The Beatles. 'I started my career as a ballet dancer and had just started working as a choreographer. I thought it was a bit of a risky move but it certainly paid off,' he once told The Sun. 'We used to receive a lot of fan mail from kids AND parents. I suppose we were a bit like the Beatles or the Take That of children's television.' Tinky Winky: Ballet dancer and choreographer Simon Shelton was the man behind the large purple creature . Shelton was not the original Tinky . Winky. Actor Dave Thompson, who now works as a stand-up comedian, was . controversially sacked by production company Ragdoll for . 'misinterpreting' the role and implying the Teletubby was gay. Shelton said it was a question he was frequently asked because of Tinky Winky's penchant for hand bags. 'People always ask me if Tinky Winky . is gay. But the character is supposed to be a three-year-old so the . question is really quite silly,' he said. The 'cool' one: Dipsy was played by stand-up comedian John Simmit . Bright green Dipsy, the 'coolest' Teletubby, who was fond of hats was played by John Simmit, 49, who was and still is a stand-up comedian. 'I was a stand-up before I became . Dipsy so I carried on doing that when the series came to an end five . years ago,' he said at the show's ten year anniversary celebrations. 'The stand-up circuit is pretty close-knit so people got to know that I . was Dipsy - but I never mentioned it on stage.' Meanwhile, dancer Nikky Smedley, 49, got the role of Laa-Laa after replying to a newspaper ad. While the Teletubbies always looked . like they were having a jolly old time, life in the suit was difficult, Nikky revealed. The . actors worked 11-hour days and the suits were heavy and hot. Since the show's conclusion, Nikky's . contributed to children's TV show Boohbah and choreographed another of . the BBC's hit children shows, In the Night Garden. Eh-oh! Dancer Nikky Smedley landed the role of Laa-Laa . Popular Po: Pui Fan Lee was the actress behind Po; Pui now hosts Show Me, Show Me . Actress Pui Fan Lee, 40, played the cute, red Po. When the . show ended 12 years ago, the British-Chinese actress moved on to hosting . CBeebies, the BBC's channel for children aged six and under. Today, she . presents Show Me, Show Me, which is aimed at pre-school children. In 2001, Pui stirred some controversy . after playing a seductive lesbian in the Channel 4 show Metrosexuality. Some were shocked when, in one episode, the actress performed a sex act . with another woman. In response, Pui said: 'I didn't . taken the lesbian role to be deliberately controversial. Yes, I was Po. But I am an actress too and the role looked interesting, exciting and . challenging.' She added: . 'When we were in the show it was weird because we never dreamed anyone . would be the slightest bit interested in us. But at the height of our . popularity there were photographers jumping out of bushes.'","Tinky Winky is a trained ballet dancer and choreographer .

"By . Bianca London . British fashion chain Topshop opened its first Hong Kong outlet today, becoming the latest Western brand to brave the city's astronomical rents in a bid to crack the lucrative China market. Topshop boss Philip Green cut the ribbon to the 1,300-square-meter (14,000-square-foot) shop with the help of Taiwanese actress Gwei Lun-mei. Green said he wants to use the store, located in the city's central business district, as a 'stepping stone' to mainland China. Sir Philip, 61, posed with actress Gwei Lun-Mei to cut the ribbon at the grand opening of Hong Kong's new store . He's looking for possible locations in Beijing and Shanghai to open 'flagship' stores. Other foreign retailers that have launched recently in the Asian finance center include U.S. brands Abercrombie & Fitch, Tommy Bahama, Forever 21 and Victoria's Secret. Foreign brands have been lining up to open showcase boutiques in Hong Kong as they try to get a share of the spending by the increasingly affluent consumers visiting from mainland China, the world's second biggest economy. The demand has helped drive up shop rents in Hong Kong, a former British colony that's now a special administrative region of China. Topshop boss Philip Green cut the ribbon to the 1,300-square-meter (14,000-square-foot) shop with the help of Taiwanese actress Gwei Lun-mei . Green said he wants to use the store as a 'stepping stone' to mainland China . Prime retail space cost $4,328 per square foot a month in the first three months of 2013, making it the world's priciest, according to commercial real estate firm CBRE . Also at the event, which drew in huge crowds, was Kim Hyoyeon from the band Girls' Generation . Hong Kong is a popular shopping destination for mainland Chinese people because of low taxes and a reputation for authentic goods. Green would not say how much the company, which already has stores in other Asian countries including Japan, Indonesia and Thailand, is paying for its new location. The spot was previously occupied by a Chinese-state owned chain selling arts and crafts and jade jewellery. He confirmed that the company had spent years looking for the right location. 'It's been hard as most retailers will tell you, finding the right location in Hong Kong, at a sort of sensible price. It's very, very tough. So this just came up, and fortunately we were able to put it together very quickly,' he said. Green is also looking for possible locations in Beijing and Shanghai to open 'flagship' stores .

Prime retail space cost $4,328 per square foot a month in the first three months of 2013, making it the world's priciest, according to commercial real estate firm CBRE. It said that was nearly 50 percent higher than New York and about four times as much as Paris or London. Topshop is working with local department store Lane Crawford to operate the new boutique. Green said that he's starting his search for mainland locations this week, with Chinese real estate agents visiting him while he's in Hong Kong. 'I'd like to have a flagship in Beijing and a flagship in Shanghai,' Green said a day before the store opening. 'If we can find 2,000 to 3,000 square meters - we'd like to have a Topman as well - if we can find 2 locations, off we go.'

Green would not say how much the company, which already has stores in other Asian countries including Japan, Indonesia and Thailand, is paying for its new location . Green said he'd also consider mainland locations outside of the two main cities as well as opening up another Hong Kong store. Foreign brands prefer to test out the waters in Hong Kong, on the southern coast of China, before taking the plunge into the mainland. The city is an ideal testing ground, with nearly three-quarters of the 49 million visitors received last year coming from mainland China. Their spending helped push up retail sales by 10 percent. Tom Gaffney, head of retail at real estate at consulting firm Jones Lang LaSalle, said foreign retailers in Hong Kong benefit by getting brand recognition and customer loyalty from mainland shoppers. Sir Philip Green poses to open the new TopShop Store in Hong Kong with actress Gwei Lun-Mei to cut the ribbon . But he said that rentals, which his firm forecasts will rise 5-10 percent this year, are 'something that a lot of the brands are looking at more carefully.' They're becoming 'quite cautious about taking core locations,' he said. Swedish fashion retailer H&M is one high-profile victim of Hong Kong's high rents. The company reportedly couldn't agree on a lease renewal for its flagship store across the street from Topshop's new outlet and will move out in the fall.","Topshop boss Philip Green cut the ribbon to the 1,300-square-meter shop .

Phil Demers, left resigned from Marineland in Niagara Falls, Ontario in May after 12 years as a senior trainer . Damage: 'The chemicals we were using to try to maintain the water were really harming the animals,' said Mr Demers . Disturbing:The former trainer described a pattern of neglect that has repeatedly resulted in animal suffering . Recalling the condition of Seal Lions Baker . and Sander, he said that they could not even train them to open their . eyes as 'the damage was so extensive that when we finally saw it, it was . just grotesque.' He told how the trainers would pull . the animals out of the water to dry conditions to try and alleviate the . damage but said as a consequence not having access to . fresh water also proved to be harmful for the animals. 'Baker was writhing in pain, constantly shaking erratically, clutching his eyes shut,' he said. He . explained that Sandy did not move for weeks on end and to try and gain a . monetary respite from the agony, Baker would constantly put his head . into a bucket of fresh water. Mr Demers told how he eventually removed Baker from the dry environment, because he was concerned about his health. 'He . actually barked and his eyeball lens had projected from his eye socket . an landed on the floor, streams of blood was coming from his eye.' Talking about Baker and Sander he said that they could not even train them to open their eyes: 'the damage was so extensive that when we finally saw it, it was just grotesque' He said that now Baker swims in circles repeatedly, 'with no real agenda.' Mr . Demers' disturbing claims have been backed up by seven other former Marineland . staffers who also gave disturbing accounts to the newspaper. Since the interview was published by the Toronto Star, many people have demanded for the closure of the privately owned facility which charges adult visitors $48.53 a ticket and children $35.95.

John Holer, owner of the Niagara institution for 51 years, told the newspaper that there was not an issue with water quality at the park. He said there were a sufficient number of staff to look after the animals, that all the facilities were legal and denied that unhealthy water has harmed marine mammals. It was only last year that the aquarium was the centre of controversy when it entered into a custody battle with SeaWorld Parks.

SeaWorld officials raised concerns about the number of staff and training. staffing numbers and training. They also claimed Holer did not allow trainers to attend workshops to update their skills.

The prize: Joe Flacco of last year's winner, the Baltimore Ravens, lifts the Super Bowl trophy . THE GAME EXPLAINED . From the British perspective, American football looks very much like a game of rugby, albeit with added padding. But that's not so, says Nat Coombs, NFL presenter for Channel 4. Instead, he says, it's all about possession which means risks, thrills and spills crop up far more often. 'The ball changes hands far less frequently than in football or rugby,' he reveals. 'So teams like to protect the ball much more than they do in other sports, which means they take less risks.'

Our experts: Detroit Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford and NFL aficionado and TV presenter, Vernon Kay . For those who have absolutely no idea what it all means, he explains: 'The objective is drive the ball . down the field as efficiently as you can until you score either a . Touchdown (worth six points, plus a shot at an extra point “conversion”) or a Field Goal (a kick through the upright . worth three points). 'Teams usually try for a field goal from around 50 yards or nearer - . often they want to bank the points rather than risk coughing the ball . back to the other side.' 'American football . is a really strategic game,' adds American Football aficionado, TV presenter Vernon Kay. 'It’s like chess, only with really, really . big pieces.' MEET THE TEAMS . This year's tussle pits the Denver Broncos against the Seattle Seahawks, with the Broncos the favourite to win, largely thanks to efforts of their star quarterback, Peyton Manning. But according to Matthew Stafford, a quarterback playing for the Detroit Lions, Manning has competition in the shape of his teammate, Knowshon Moreno. 'One player who is flying a little bit . under the radar is my old College mate Knowshon Moreno – running back . for the Denver Broncos,' says Stafford. Star name: Denver Bronco's top quarterback Peyton Manning warms up ahead of his Super Bowl debut . Ready for action: A crowd of Seattle Seahawks fans prepare to head to New Jersey for the big game . Hot dog expert and American food expert Steven Raichlen explains how to make the perfect Super Bowl snack. INGREDIENTS . 8 thick knockwursts or hot dogs4 to 6 jalapeno pepers, sliced crosswise (32 slices)4 to 5oz Cheddar or Gruyere cheese8 hot dog buns2 tablespoons melted butterMustard, ketchup, relish, and/or diced onions, for serving . METHOD . For more American recipes, see Steven's website, barbecuebible.com . 'If the weather isn’t great in New York he will . be called on a lot more and I will be looking out for him this weekend.' The pair will, however, have to overcome the Seahawks' formidable defensive line if they want to take the trophy home and that means getting past the likes of Richard Sherman and Earl Thomas - both of whom came within a whisker of being named the NFL Defensive Player of the Year. 'You’ve got the Seahawks defense, whose . defensive backs call themselves the Legion of Boom,' enthuses Kay. 'I love that. Any . part of a team that has a nickname should be commended. They’ve got . great defensive players all over their team, and that’s why they’ve . conceded so few points over the season – an average of just 14 points . per game.' 'The Super Bowl happens just once every . year and the two best teams in the world meet for the ultimate prize in [American] . football,' adds Stafford. 'Whatever happens it is going to be exciting.' HOW TO STAY ENTERTAINED . Along with eating your own weight in nachos and watching the action, according to Kay, drinking games are a popular way to keep your spirits up while play continues. 'There’s been a lot of talk . about [Denver Broncos quarterback] Payton Manning ahead of the game, and about how one of the calls . he makes at the line of scrimmage [see Nat Coomb's explanation below] is Omaha,' he explains. 'If you go to Twitter, . there’s a fantastic Omaha drinking game. It’s one way of entertaining . yourself during the game. Not that I’m encouraging drinking during . football, of course. But it’s very funny!' HALF TIME FUN . He might not have the glamour of last year's halftime performer, Beyonce, but Bruno Mars certainly knows how to knock out a tune. One of the youngest performers ever to perform during the Super Bowl, the 28-year-old star will be joined on stage by veteran rockers, the Red Hot Chilli Peppers. 'The Super Bowl is just such an amazing spectacle,' adds Stafford. 'Everything that goes into it, helps make it the biggest sporting event in the world. 'From the half time . shows to the TV adverts this is the game everyone wants to be involved . in.' The Super Bowl: American Football Live - Channel 4 on Sunday 2nd February from 10:30pm . Half time: Bruno Mars will become one of the youngest ever half time performers when he takes to the stage . Glamour: The Red Hot Chilli Peppers will join Mars this year - Beyonce wowed the crowds in 2013 . NFL is a game of possession . The ball changes hands far less frequently than football or rugby. So teams like to protect the ball much more than they do in other sports, which means they take less risks. Broadcaster Alistair Cooke compared the strategy found in the NFL to a game of chess and the surface level complexity of the game – each man has a very clear, mapped out set of objectives for each play – sometimes confuses the newbie fan. But although it’s highly technical in some respects, it’s ultra simple at the core. The objectives explained . Drive the ball down the field as efficiently as you can until you score either a Touchdown (worth six points, plus a shot at an extra point “conversion”)  or a Field Goal (a kick through the upright worth three points) which teams usually try from circa 50 yards or nearer, often if they want to bank the points rather than risk coughing the ball back to the other side. It's ALL about possession . The team with the ball (the offense) has four shots (downs) at advancing it a minimum of 10 yards and this is all run by its offensive general, the Quarterback. If they make the 10 yards (or more) they get another four chances, and this keeps on going till they get the ball into the EndZone (for a touch down) or decide to kick the Field Goal or if they give the ball back to the opposition, consciously or otherwise. Here's how things can go wrong... If they feel that they’re in danger of losing possession – they need too many yards to guarantee another set of downs, or its too far for a Field Goal attempt - then they’ll punt (kick, like an supersized up and under) the ball back to the other side who promptly try and take the ball back up the field the other way to score. They can also lose possession by fumbling - losing control of the ball allowing the other team to gain it, or via an interception which is when the quarterback throws it and a defender catches it instead of the intended target. And don't forget the opposing team! Oh, and while the Offense is trying to get lucky, the opposing team’s Defense is trying to nail each and every one of them.","Flummoxed by American football?

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A gregarious male gorilla is to be sent for therapy after he bit one female gorilla and sneered at others. Patrick, a 430lb Western lowland gorilla, will be moved from Dallas Zoo to the Riverbanks Zoo and Gardens in Columbia, South Carolina, where he will live the bachelor life in his own digs. His new home is known for working with gorillas with behaviour problems. Not a ladies' man: Patrick, a 430-pound Western lowland gorilla, will be moved to the Riverbanks Zoo and Gardens in Columbia, South Carolina, after he bit one female and sneered and nipped at others . Dallas Zoo officials said Patrick gets along fine with humans but not with other gorillas. They said they have tried repeatedly to socialise him with the other gorillas, particularly the females, in the hopes that he might get along and even breed. Instead, he bit one female and sneered and nipped at others. 'It's not like we haven't tried, he's been here for 18 years' said Laurie Holloway, a spokesman for the zoo. Patrick was more tolerant of other male gorillas but seemed only to engage with Jabari, who was shot dead by Dallas police after he escaped in 2004 and injured three people. Only friend: Patrick (background) with his friend Jabari, who was shot dead by Dallas police after escaping and injuring three people in 2004 . Because of his cranky behaviour, Patrick has been kept in his own habitat separate from the other gorillas. But Dallas Zoo needs to reclaim Patrick's space because it recently acquired two new males from the Calgary Zoo, including Zola, a break-dancing gorilla who stars in a video that has gone viral on the Internet. John Davis, curator of mammals at the Riverbanks Zoo, said that initially Patrick will be separated from the zoo's three other gorillas, all males, but will be able to see and smell them. Eventually Patrick will be introduced to the guys and zoo officials aren't ruling out the possibility that they can live together in a spacious, wooded bachelor pad, Davis said. Born at the Bronx Zoo in 1990, Patrick was abandoned by his mother and then transferred to the Toronto Zoo, where he was hand-raised along with another male about the same age. At age five, he was transferred to Dallas, zoo officials said. Because of his rearing, Patrick gets along well with people and is a popular favorite among visitors and zookeepers at the Dallas Zoo, Holloway said. 'He's beautiful and smart and everyone loves him,' said Ms Holloway. 'We're really sad to see him go but it's for the best for the zoo and for Patrick.' The zoo will have a few days of 'We'll miss ya, Patrick!' celebrations for the ousted primate.","Patrick, a 430lb Western lowland gorilla, is to be sent to live in his own bachelor pad after failing to socialise with other animals .

Bizarre: Israeli artist Naomi Kizhner's innovative jewellery designs  come complete with spikes on each end which insert into the wearer's veins and convert kinetic power from the body into electricity . Would YOU wear it? Naomi Kizhner's innovative jewellery designs aren't for the faint hearted - they come with spikes to attach to your body so that your blood flow can create enough kinetic which is then turned into electrical power . The collection, which is called Energy Addicts, features three designs. The Blood Bridge can be inserted into the veins of your lower arm. Another piece, named The Blinker, fits onto the bridge of the nose and harnesses the energy created while blinking. When the wearer blinks, there's an increased flow of blood to the area around the eyes and her statement gold jewellery collects that energy, which, she says, can be used to light up an LED or charge your mobile devices. Quirky: The Blinker, which can be fitted onto the bridge of your nose, is one of her more painful looking designs - although she insists they don't hurt . Ouch! The collection, which is called Energy Addicts, features three designs, the first is aptly named Blood Bridge, which can be inserted into the veins on your lower arm .

"By . Mark Duell . A mother of two feared she would need an emergency operation to save her sight after she suffered a horrendous allergic reaction on her face - allegedly to Piz Buin sun cream. Marie Goldie, 37, of Glasgow, who was on holiday with her partner and two teenage children in Tenerife, Spain, was taken to hospital days after she started using Piz Buin 1 Day Long. Doctors at a hospital in Playa de las Américas feared the catering worker’s reaction was so bad she would require an emergency operation - but steroid injections eventually brought it under control. Allergic reaction: Marie Goldie, 37, of Glasgow, who was on holiday with her partner and two teenage children in Tenerife, Spain, was taken to hospital days after she started using Piz Buin 1 Day Long . But Miss Goldie said she was furious when Johnson & Johnson, the makers of the popular sun lotion, offered her only a £5 refund following her ordeal she claimed was caused by using the product. She said: ‘I thought my time was up. I have never suffered anything like that before. I first used the cream on Wednesday. By Thursday I had a rash which the local pharmacist said was prickly heat. ‘By Friday, one eye had swollen over. But by Saturday I couldn't see at all. I go abroad every year on holiday with the family. The previous few years I've been to the Dominican Republic and Turkey. ‘(They were) far hotter than Tenerife, which was only 23C when I was there. The only thing that was different was the sun cream I used. It was the first time I had used Piz Buin.’ Doctors gave Miss Goldie - who was abroad earlier this month with partner Russell, 40, and children Kieran, 13 and Nicole, 19 - four steroid injections and antihistamines over the course of a day. She claimed medical staff discharged her after saying she would need to pay for her own treatment because her travel insurance would not cover the treatment an allergic reaction. Miss Goldie added: ‘Luckily my condition had already begun to calm down after the injections and I was only left with a doctor's bill of around €100. It could have been much worse.’ After leaving hospital, medical staff gave her strict instructions to avoid sunlight, sugary and fatty foods, and she spent the next week trying to get home earlier than planned. Unhappy: Miss Goldie was furious when Johnson & Johnson, the manufacturers of the popular sun lotion, offered her just a £5 refund following her ordeal she claimed was caused by using the product . She said: ‘The holiday was ruined and we were just desperate to get home. I spent the next week in my room trying to get cheap flights, to no avail. ‘I also looked up Piz Buin on the internet and couldn't believe how many people were complaining about allergic reactions. I'm convinced using the cream caused the reaction.’ Last week, the sun cream featured on . the BBC's Watchdog show after producers were inundated with . health complaints about it. Leading . dermatologist Dr Ian White, of St John's Institute of Dermatology in London, said two of the cream's ingredients could be the reason . for the severe reactions he had seen. He . said his organisation had demanded urgent action into the safety of one . of the chemicals used in Piz Buin, C30-38 Olefin/Isopropyl Maleate MA . Copolymer, two years ago. He also claimed that one in 10 of the patients he now sees were allergic to another active ingredient in the cream - Methylisothiazolinone. Since Marie arrived back in Britian last Saturday, her GP confirmed she suffered an allergic reaction, and further tests were planned to see if Piz Buin was behind this reaction. A Johnson & Johnson spokesman said: ‘The safety of our products is our first priority. ‘All ingredients in our products are reviewed by experts and all our final formulations are assessed for safety and efficacy, including the potential for skin irritation and toxicity caused by sun exposure. 'In principle nearly every substance or product in our daily life may cause irritation in some people with a particular sensitivity. ‘This applies to the ingredients of all cosmetic and personal care products, and includes those ingredients in Piz Buin 1 Day Long - C30-38 Olefin/Isopropyl Maleate MA Copolymer and Methylisothiazolinone. ‘We have received some consumer complaints that Piz Buin 1 Day Long Day Long has led to skin irritation or rashes. Compared to the number of people using the product across the UK and Ireland, the number of reported incidents is small - approximately 0.01 per cent of sales. ‘Since the Watchdog report was broadcasted we have been contacted by a number of consumers, and we are currently investigating their complaints. ‘We have provided Ms Goldie with a questionnaire and requested that she return the product to us so that we can investigate her complaint. We have offered her a refund or replacement for the product.’","Marie Goldie, 37, was on holiday with partner and children in Tenerife .

"By . Rebecca English . Prince Charles said he feared the next generation of pensioners will be 'consigned to an exceptionally miserable future' Prince Charles has launched a stinging attack on the pensions industry, accusing it of adopting a short-term approach that risks causing misery for the elderly in the future. The heir to the throne said he feared the next generation of pensioners would be ‘consigned to an exceptionally miserable future’ unless the sector mended its ways. If it did not, he said, it could become ‘unfit for purpose’. The prince, who will be old enough to collect his free bus pass next month, made his comments in a pre-recorded speech at the annual conference of the National Association of Pension Funds in Manchester. And yesterday he had pensions experts queueing up to praise him. Many pointed to a report by pensions expert and ex-Downing Street advisor Ros Altmann, who earlier this week called for an overhaul of pensions and argued they were ‘not fit for 21st-century lives’. Dr Altmann backed Charles’s comments, saying: ‘Pensions are meant to deliver long-term value. What we don’t want is to get hijacked by the short-term and sell our children’s future away.’ Paul Green, director of communications for over-50s body Saga, said Charles was ‘absolutely right’ to speak out. Labour MP Paul Flynn said: ‘This is an entirely reasonable point to make, but it is not the role of the head of state to make it – and he is supposed to be in training to be head of state. ‘He has to stay above political controversy and he should think about keeping his mouth bandaged. ‘Every now and again the Prince of . Wales is going to say something right. Some of what he says is right, . but some of it is eccentric and some of it is barmy.’ Aides insist the prince has a right to make his opinions known as part of the monarchy’s role to ‘advise, encourage and warn’. Critics, however, have long warned the . prince risks riding a coach and horses through the institution’s need . to remain impartial. They say it will be impossible for him to put aside . such deeply held views when he becomes king and that his clear lack of . neutrality are likely to cause huge constitutional tensions. Prince Charles said that unless Britain can support its ageing population, it is consigned to a miserable future . In . his address, the prince said: ‘We live in increasingly uncertain times. 'We are facing what could be described as a “perfect storm” – the . combination of pollution and over-consumption of finite natural . resources; the very real and accumulating risk of catastrophic climate . change; unprecedented levels of financial indebtedness, and a population . of 7 billion that is rising fast. ‘You . have a need, and arguably a duty, to ensure these emerging . environmental, social and economic risks are identified and managed. ‘With . an ageing population, and pension fund liabilities that are therefore . stretching out for many decades, surely the current focus on “quarterly . capitalism” is becoming increasingly unfit for purpose?’ He . continued: ‘I know that old habits die hard and that it is difficult to . make the first move, but is there not a case for ensuring your . portfolios are resilient in the long-term? ‘I . can only urge you to deploy your considerable human ingenuity to make . that innovative and imaginative leap that the world so badly needs – . otherwise your grandchildren, and mine for that matter, will be . consigned to an exceptionally miserable future.’ New . rules force bosses to pay into a pension for their workers for the . first time, a revolution affecting up to 11 million people. All workers, . aged between 22 and State pension age, who are not members of a pension . scheme, are being signed up to a pension by their boss, known as . ‘automatic enrolment’. A worker pays just 1 per cent of his or her salary into the scheme with the boss contributing the same amount. By 2018, the minimum contribution will have increased to a total of 8 per cent. Miss Segars said: ‘There are not many of us who think that the 8 per cent is enough to deliver a decent pension.’","Prince warns of 'miserable future' if Britain cannot support its elderly .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Experts were baffled today after video footage emerged of a glowing squid-like creature swimming in a harbour. Stunned eyewitnesses filmed the strange, luminescent, tentacled object which was flashing a variety of colours floating close to the top of the water. Videos of the strange marine mystery in Bristol docks have popped up on YouTube and Twitter with many claiming to have seen an 'alien'. Scroll down for video... This bizarre sight greeted people walking along Bristol harbourside - described by some as an 'alien-like creature' floating underwater . Dozens of people were left flummoxed after spotting the creature and quickly grabbed cameras to snap it. Some have even suggested that Bristol legend Banksy may have had something to do with the weird object. Marine biologists admit they are baffled, . but claim the footage could be a marine salp which had drifted off . course by the weather. Dr Steve Simpson, from the School of Biological Sciences at Bristol University, said: 'This is either a very interesting animal or someone's very cool interpretation of a marine creature.' One Twitter said: 'It's obviously Father Christmas's underwater sleigh.' While another questioned whether it had escaped from Bristol Zoo. Marine biologists admit they are baffled, but claim the footage could be a marine salp which had drifted off course by the weather. Dr Steve Simpson, from the School of Biological Sciences at Bristol University, said: 'It's very intriguing - I don't really know what to make of it. 'There is a possibility that it is a special type of jellyfish or a marine salp. It's very unusual and I haven't really seen anything like it before though. Dozens of people were left flummoxed after spotting the creature and quickly grabbed cameras to snap it . Stunned eyewitnesses filmed the strange, luminescent, tentacled object which was flashing a variety of colours floating close to the top of the water . 'What makes it even more unusual is that fact that it showed up in the middle of a really busy area. 'There are various marine animals that have biological illuminating abilities and they are able to make themselves flash. 'It is entirely possible that it is a marine creature which has been brought into the harbour because of the storms or maybe it was trying to shelter from the stormy seas. Intrigue: Marine biologists claimed it could be a salp which had drifted off course . 'We are currently experiencing spring tides too which may have dragged whatever this is in from the sea. 'This is either a very interesting animal or someone's very cool interpretation of a marine creature. 'It looks really cool - it's incredible. I don't know if it will make a return tonight but I'm sure if it does it will be met by an eager crowd.' Scientists said what made the sight unusual was the fact that the creature showed up in the middle of a really busy area. There are various marine animals that have biological illuminating abilities and they are able to make themselves flash . It has not yet been established exactly what the creature was and whether it was alive or not. Some people have suggested that Bristol legend Banksy may have had something to do with the weird object. Dozens of people were left flummoxed after spotting the creature and quickly grabbed cameras to snap it. Alex Gordon-Lennox, 22, who was one of the many people to witness the strange creature, said: 'It was just floating down the harbour. I've never seen anything like it before. 'I only noticed it because it was flashing and was so bright. I was out with some friends that night so we watched it travel down the water a bit and then it just seemed to disappear. 'It looked a bit like a jellyfish or a squid or something. It was amazing.'","Videos of light appeared on YouTube with many claiming it to be an 'alien'

"By . Sara Smyth . The House of Lords voted last night on an extension of the Human Rights Act, which could cover middle-class elderly people . Elderly people paying for their own care could be protected under the same human rights laws as those who receive State care, after a landmark vote in the House of Lords last night. Under the current system, people whose care is funded by the State may sue care homes on human rights grounds if they are treated badly. Last night’s ‘unprecedented’ decision to support an extension of the Human Rights Act could cover middle-class elderly people who live in private care homes or pay to be looked after. The Lords voted by 247 to 218 to support a move that would ensure even people who paid for their own care would be covered by the Act. The amendment to the Care Bill was backed by a majority of 29 despite health minister Earl Howe arguing it was ‘neither necessary or appropriate’. He said the Human Rights Act dealt with public functions – the ‘interface between the  individual and the State’. And he said if the amendment was agreed ‘it would represent an unprecedented change to the scope of the Human Rights Act’. ‘For the first time, it would  capture purely private arrangements such as a privately arranged social care contract between a private care home and a private individual – an arrangement in which there is no State involvement at all,’ he said. Independent crossbencher Lord Low of Dalston, who proposed the report stage amendment, said that following a 2007 court case – YL against Birmingham City Council – there had been uncertainty over whether care home services provided by the private sector under contract with a local authority were covered by the Act. The Lords voted 247 to 218 to support a move that would ensure even people who paid for their own care would be covered by the act . He said his amendment would settle the matter and ‘include those who are eligible for care but who, due to means testing, have to arrange and/or pay for the own care – so called self-funders’  currently not covered under human rights laws. The amendment would ‘provide equal protection to all users of regulated social care, regardless of where that care is provided and who is paying for it’. The amendment to the Care Bill was backed by a majority of 29 . He added: ‘Surely it is right to take this opportunity of putting the matter beyond doubt.’Lord Mackay, supporting the amendment, told peers that the Department of Health said people who provided this type of care ‘should consider themselves bound by the Human Rights Act’. But he said the position should be made clear. Labour former health minister Lord Warner pointed to the case of a woman who had been paying for herself in a care home. ‘She had the temerity to air her views on assisted dying which didn’t please some of the staff,’ he said. ‘She didn’t seek anybody’s help to commit suicide, she just expressed her views. ‘The home’s management gave her four weeks’ notice to leave the home as a result.‘When her son raised the issue of her rights under the Human Rights Act with legal counsel, the opinion he was given was that she lacked protection under the act because she was not in receipt of a service from a body providing a function of a public nature because her placement was neither in a publicly provided or publicly funded home.’ He called for Parliament to provide self-funders with the ‘legal certainty that other elderly people have when they are having domiciliary care or residential care’.","Lords voted 247 to 218 in favour of the amendment to Human Rights Act .
Could receive same protection as those receiving state support .
May cover those who pay for private care homes or to be looked after ."
