"(CNN) -- Prague has not been nicknamed ""Zlata Praha"" or ""Golden Prague"" for no good reason. The well-deserved eponym is a tribute to this city that mixes architecture, history, art and beauty like no other. While not forgetting its more somber communist past, Prague has been one of the first East European cities to get a luxurious makeover. Designer shopping malls, exclusive restaurants and trendy nightclubs abound. But it is the mystical atmosphere of a Prague of past eras that leaves many visitors craving to come back. Largely untouched by the ravages of WWII, Prague is arguably the only European city with so many century-old buildings left intact for people to enjoy. All more impressive than the others, these are the historical sites you should not miss in Prague. Wenceslas Square: In 1348, King Charles IV of Bohemia (now the Czech Republic) founded the town of Prague. The King built several open areas for markets, including Wenceslas Square, previously known as the Horse Market. Named after Saint Wenceslas, the patron saint of the Czech state, the square is the largest in the city and was at the center of much of Prague's history, including the Nazi occupation, the Soviet invasion, and the Velvet Revolution. In 1969, Prague student Jan Palach set himself on fire in Wenceslas Square to protest the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. And in 1989, during the Velvet Revolution that overthrew the Communist regime, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators gathered here to protest. Today the square has become one of the trendiest and busiest in the country. Lining Wenceslas Square are fashion stores, cafes, bars and kiosks. Above the square is Prague's Museum of Natural History, which was shot at by Communist troops when they mistook it for the Parliament building. Prague Castle: Kings, Roman Emperors and Presidents have lived in this legendary castle that overlooks the city. The castle is the largest medieval castle complex in Europe and arguable Prague's prime tourist attraction. First built in the 9th century, Prague Castle has survived wars, fires and opposing political powers. The castle complex consists of the Saint Virtus Cathedral, viewing towers, a monastery, museums and art galleries. The Czech crown jewels are also held here. After Czechoslovakia split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993, the castle became the seat of the President of the new Czech Republic. Charles Bridge: This magnificent 14th century gothic bridge over Prague's Vltava river is lined with a series of large stone statues that represent important religious figures and icons. Its construction started in 1357 under King Charles IV and finished in the beginning of the 15th century. Until the 19th century, the bridge was the only way to cross between the Old Town and adjacent areas, also known as the ""Lesser Town."" During the day, thousands of people traverse the bridge to watch the views of the city and enjoy the numerous street performers. Dancing House: A masterpiece of modern architecture, Dancing House was named after dancing duo Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Dancing House is also sometimes nicknamed ""Drunk House"" for its wavy curves. The building was constructed between 1992 and 1996 by Czech architect Vlado Milunc and world-renowned Canadian architect Frank Gehry. The top floor houses one of the city's most exclusive restaurants, Celeste. Old Town Square: Located in the heart of the Old Town, this square included Prague's gothic Church of Our Lady before Tyn, the main church of this part of the city since the 14th century. The church's towers are 80 meters high and topped by small golden spires. Another fixture of the Old Town Square is the baroque-style St. Nicholas Church. In the center of the square is a large statue of Jan Hus, a Catholic priest who was burned at the stake by the Roman Catholic Church for heresy in 1415. But the most popular attraction for visitors of the square is the famous Astronomical Clock. Astronomical Clock: Built in 1410, the Astronomical Clock still functions and provides accurate data on a number of astrological events, such as the relative positions of the sun, moon and major planets. Each hour, the clock bells and a series of moving wooden puppets come out. Below the Astronomical Clock are 12 medallions with the signs of the zodiac, added by painter Josef Manes in 1865. Prague Cathedral: Saint Vitus's Cathedral is another one of Prague's Gothic masterpieces. The Cathedral, set in the walls of the Prague Castle, was commissioned by King Charles IV and work on it began in 1344. It took nearly six centuries to complete. Today it is the seat of the Archbishop of Prague and contains the tombs of many of the Bohemian Kings. The interior features stained-glass windows from different eras. One of the cathedral's chambers was used to crown several Kings and it is said the room can only be opened with seven golden keys given to different members of parliament. Vyshehrad: The old fortress of Vyshehrad and its surrounding parks is the place where the city of Prague was originally founded and around which the city was built. It is a great place to get a sense of the history of the city. Its thick walls house the National Cemetery, where many of Prague's most illustrious citizens are buried, including Czech composer Antonín Leopold Dvorak and writer Karel Capek.","""Golden City"" is a well-deserved eponym for a city that mixes history and beauty like no other .

"(CNN) -- Defending champion Rafael Nadal struggled with a misfiring service and an awkward opponent in veteran Czech Radek Stepanek before battling into the third round of the Masters 1000 event at Indian Wells. Nadal was in deep trouble in the third and deciding set before pulling out a 2-6 6-3 7-5 victory. The world number one admitted that the back problem which affected him during his Australian Open final defeat to Stanislas Wawrinka was still leaving him with doubts. ""I was a little bit scared for the back. I am not yet 100 per cent confident with my service,"" he told gathered reporters after serving eight double faults in the two hour 40 minute encounter. Stepanek, 35, also posed an unusual challenge as Nadal acknowledged: ""He is not the right player to play against in the first match because what you want to find is rhythm and against him every point is different."" Stepanek swept through the first set before Nadal hit back to level and take a break lead in the third set. Stepanek broke back then forced three break points on the Spaniard's service in the sixth game. ""It's true that with love-40, I was very close to losing, to being out, but I think I did two good serves and then I played a great point,"" said Nadal. ""Tough one. Anything can happen, but in the end I played well. After that, I think I played better."" The victory extended Nadal's record to 41-6 at the Californian event, which he has won in 2007, 2009 and 2013. Earlier, third seed Wawrinka came through his first match on the ATP Tour since his triumph in Melbourne, dispatching giant Croatian Ivo Karlovic, 6-3 7-5 without any major drama. ""I was a little bit scared about the way I was going to play,"" said the Swiss, who took time off after his grand slam success. Roger Federer, who is playing in the doubles with Wawrinka, continued his winning run with a 6-2 7-5 victory over France's Paul-Henri Mathieu. The 17-time grand slam winner is fresh off his success in Dubai, where he beat world number two Novak Djokovic on the way to the title. Britain's Andy Murray joined the other big guns in the third round with a three set victory, 4-6 6-3 6-2 over Lukas Rosol, but Australia's Lleyton Hewitt is out, beaten 7-6 7-5 by in-form 17th seed Kevin Anderson of South Africa. In the WTA tournament at the same venue, top seed Li Na beat Chinese compatriot Zheng Jie 6-1 7-5, while Maria Sharapova returned to tour after her Olympic duties in Sochi with a 6-1 6-4 dismissal of Germany's Julia Goerges.","Rafael Nadal taken to three sets in Indian Wells opener .

"(CNN) -- A rare snowy owl was in stable, but guarded condition on Thursday after apparently being hit by a bus just blocks from the White House. It had been seen around town a lot lately looking for food and had attracted a number of fans. A Twitter account was set up to monitor sightings. The bird, believed to be female, was apparently hit on Wednesday night and found by police in the early morning hours on a downtown street with injuries. It was taken to the Smithsonian National Zoo's hospital where it was alert and responsive, the zoo said in a statement. There were no obvious signs of physical injury, but blood found in bird's mouth could indicate head trauma, the zoo said. The owl received pain medication and fluids before being transported to a wildlife rehabilitation center. There, experts said she also suffered a broken toe. X-rays were ordered up as was a period of evaluation before the owl would be released back into the wild, City Wildlife, an animal rehabilitation center, said in a statement on Twitter. The owl's twitter account was inundated with well-wishes Thursday from many followers who had been documenting its whereabouts around the capital.","Owl apparently hit just blocks from the White House, found by police .

"(CNN) -- The family of Victor Jara, the famous Chilean folk singer who was among the first victims of the country's military coup in 1973, has filed a lawsuit in Florida against the former army officer it alleges killed him. The killing happened 40 years ago, and it wasn't until last year that a Chilean judge charged eight former army officers with the singer-songwriter's death. One of those indicted, Pedro Barrientos, has lived in Florida since the early 1990s. That is where Jara's family filed the lawsuit Wednesday in Jacksonville. The lawsuit alleges that Barrientos executed Jara during a game of Russian roulette and ordered other soldiers to fire dozens of rounds into his corpse, in violation of U.S. and international law. The civil suit seeks compensatory and punitive damages for the killing. Barrientos has not been arrested since being charged in Chile, and the status of his legal proceedings there is unclear. CNN was not immediately able to reach Barrientos for comment, although he has denied the accusations previously. Jara, a member of the Communist Party and cultural ambassador for socialist President Salvador Allende, was detained immediately after the September 11, 1973, military coup. His body, with signs of torture and 44 bullet wounds, was found days later in an abandoned field. His is considered one of the most emblematic deaths of the political repression that followed the coup. Government investigations conducted after the end of the dictatorship say nearly 2,300 people disappeared between 1973 and 1990, and nearly 40,000 were tortured. Seeking justice decades after the oppression and in this case, when the defendant lives in another country, is a legal challenge. In the case of Jara's family, lawyers from the Center for Justice and Accountability and law firm Chadbourne & Parke cited the Torture Victim Protection Act and Alien Tort Statute. These U.S. laws allow for such lawsuits to be brought for wrongful deaths and cases of torture that occurred in other countries. ""Victor's pursuit of democracy and human rights remains an inspiration to people around the world and his memory is ever present as we mark the 40th anniversary of the military coup and of Victor's murder,"" his widow, Joan Jara, said in a statement. ""We want to shine a light on the severe human rights abuses from this era and bring those responsible to justice, so that victims who continue to silently suffer their losses may find some sense of peace."" According to the lawsuit, Barrientos was a lieutenant and section commander for the Tejas Verdes regiment, which oversaw detainees at Chile Stadium, where prisoners were taken. Hundreds of perceived enemies of the new military regime were detained and transported to the stadium. During the few days he was captive before being killed, Jara wrote a poem that survived, lamenting ""How hard it is to sing when I must sing of horror,"" according to the lawsuit. ""Horror which I am living, horror which I am dying."" While detained, Jara was blindfolded, chained and beaten by soldiers under Barrientos' command, the lawsuit alleges. Finally, Barrientos put a pistol to the back of Jara's head and ""loaded one bullet in the chamber of the pistol, spun the chamber and pulled the trigger, knowing that each shot could be lethal,"" the lawsuit states. Playing this game of Russian roulette, Barrientos shot the singer in the back of the head and ordered five other soldiers to shoot his corpse, the plaintiffs allege. ""Actually, that is not true,"" Barrientos, 64, told Chilevision TV last year. ""I was never in Chile Stadium, I don't know the singer Jara or know who he was back then."" In addition to Joan Jara, the lawsuit was filed on behalf of her daughters Amanda Jara Turner and Manuela Bunster.","Famous Chilean singer Victor Jara was killed in 1973 .

"(CNN) -- When he came into our makeshift hotel suite studio in Chicago, Chris Hardwick quickly developed a mild love affair with a bowl of mixed nuts that we placed near his chair. And for a while he even considered keeping the snacks in his hand throughout the interview. ""I want to just hold a bowl of nuts the entire time and not really explain it."" However, in the end he placed it back on the table, with a simple, ""That's dumb."" And, thus, we launched into a spirited conversation about what a huge dork he is. Because, apparently, when you're the son of a professional bowler (for real) you naturally develop a passion for the uncool. Sometimes that passion leads to a lonely, sexless life spent in your parents' basement, but, in this case, it manifested itself in the form of one of the biggest names in nerddom. ""I just kind of one day was like, 'Why am I not working around this kind of thing?' And it just so happened that G4 existed and it all fell together."" Soon he was hosting a new show called ""Web Soup,"" modeled after E!'s show ""The Soup."" Whereas the latter concentrates on pop culture and notable television moments, Hardwick's new endeavor became a showcase for the best (and worst) of the Web. However, ""Web Soup"" perhaps wasn't quite nerdy enough, so in 2010 Hardwick continued doing the show while also launching a new weekly interview podcast called ""The Nerdist."" Jim Norton: I'm dangerous to other comedians . That venture eventually led to him writing a book called ""The Nerdist Way,"" in which Hardwick offers self-help advice to his people. The book is due out this fall -- so hopefully none of his nerd followers will create an evil world-destroying robot in the meantime. That would be just tragic. Funny. But tragic. Of course, to a certain generation we would be remiss if we didn't also mention that, yes, Chris Hardwick once hosted, with Jenny McCarthy, the hit MTV dating show ""Singled Out."" There. We mentioned it.","Chris Hardwick hosts ""Web Soup"" on G4, modeled after E!'s ""The Soup""

"(CNN) -- At first glance, the contorted limbs and faceless forms in Patrice Letarnec's photographs look like a wackier version of the 1990s trend of wearing your clothes backwards. But Letarnec's photo series ""Walking Upside Down,"" which features people doing handstands with their clothes on upside down, is a far departure from hip-hop sensation Kriss Kross' dated fashion trend. The French photographer explains that the silliness of his images is actually a form of social commentary. His photo series was inspired by the French expression ""marcher sur la tÃªte""-- walking on your head, a colloquial phrase for acting foolishly. ""Walking on your head shows the absurdity of human behavior,"" he told CNN through a translator. ""We do silly things, humans do silly things."" The characters of his photo series are set in public spaces throughout Paris. Letarnec wanted to highlight the architecture of French buildings against the absurd poses that his characters were doing. The combination of strangely intriguing poses and whimsical Parisian settings became instantly popular after he uploaded his photographs to his tumblr with various bloggers reposting his images online . He came up with the concept in December 2013 and drew out poses that he wanted his characters to be in for the photographs. While attempting to do a handstand against a wall in his Nantes studio, he realized he needed skilled people who were capable of standing on their hands for this type of photo shoot. Letarnec contacted Parisian schools to find dancers who were interested in being a part of his project. His inquiries were greeted with enthusiasm, and several dancers lined up to participate. But they did face some interesting challenges. ""During the series, one of the dancers said they could not do the walking handstands because in order to walk on their hands they had to see the horizon. And in the series, their heads are covered by clothing,"" he said. ""I was so nervous this project wasn't going to happen."" But after several takes, the dancers grew comfortable with the walking handstands and started loosening up, adding their own personal movements to the photographs. The 44-year-old artist was thrilled to see his characters add their own interpretation to the series. Letarnec currently works at an ad agency and said his true passion isn't necessarily photography, but contemporary art. For him, photography is a medium to capture an idea, like this one. He was drawn to his ""Walking Upside Down"" project because he wanted take a surreal idea, and shoot it in a realistic way, without using any lighting effects or photo editing software in his work. ""In the U.S. people might see this just as a series of silly photos, but it's a social commentary,"" he said. ""I tried to show a funny way to send a message about human behavior. I think French people may be more sensitive to these photos because of the expression."" Either way, Letarnec said he embraces the idea that people find the series fun, and said the photos are supposed to seem silly.","Artist Patrice Letarnec strives to show human foolishness through his photographs .

"(Wired) -- Rafael Araujo's illustrations are bewilderingly complex - so complex that you might assume the artist uses a computer to render the exacting angles and three-dimensional illusions. And true, if you were to recreate his intricate mathematical illustrations using software, it probably wouldn't take you long at all. But the craziest part of all is that Araujo doesn't use modern technology to create his intricately drawn Calculations series - unless, of course, you count a ruler and protractor. Read more: Mind-blowing portraits made of test tubes and pushpins . The Venezuelan artist crafts his illustrations using same skills you and I learned in our 10th grade geometry class. Only instead of stashing those homework assignments deep into the locker of his brain, Araujo uses these concepts to create his da Vinci-esque drawings. In Araujo's work, butterflies take flight amidst a web of lines and helixes, a shell is born from a conical spiral, and the mathematical complexity of nature begins to make sense. He says perspective and angles have always come naturally to him. ""When I was young I began drawing perspective almost out of the blue,"" he recalls. ""I loved three-dimensional drawings and liked to find out ways to locate dots in the space."" Before computer-assisted drawing, there were artists like M.C. Escher, who Araujo counts among his biggest influences. ""When I first saw M.C. Escher, I was speechless,"" he says. ""His artwork was so akin to my geometrical taste."" Read more: Origami - perfect blend of math and art . Working on an old drafting table, Araujo began drawing his own perspective illustrations, eyeballing the trigonometry to plot dot sequences that would allow him to create curved shapes like double helixes and cones. If you look closely at Araujo's drawings, you'll notice each of the main shapes sits within a line-drawn square or rectangle - he began adding this to his works after realizing these scaffolding boxes created a more reliable way to correctly position the dots. ""There is naturally a learning curve,"" he says. ""And as problems are solved, you become more adept and, again, daring."" As Araujo became more confident in his skills, he began adding ink-drawn butterflies, insects and shells to the canvas and painting them with acrylic in order to add visual complexity to his work. Each illustration takes him upwards of 100 hours, and that's if he doesn't mess up. ""Painting is very similar to cooking,"" he says. ""You've got to be always careful!"" Read more: These shimmering LED installations transport you to an alternate universe . Even with the added embellishments, his work is restrained and exacting. But that scientific honesty is also what makes his illustrations so visually compelling. Scientists and mathematicians often say there's a comfort in their work because they know there's always a right and wrong answer. It's the same with Araujo's art. There's little gray area to be debated when it comes to angles and lines, and somehow that reliability and predictability translates into something beautiful. ""I love Pollock, and enjoy very much casting paint onto a canvas without rules,"" he says. ""But you've got to make it to appear, if not ""beautiful,"" well done, and that is difficult.""

"(CNN) -- I have the great privilege of writing the theater column for The New Criterion, the arts-and-culture journal founded by New York Times art critic Hilton Kramer and pianist Samuel Lipman in 1982. Some people have to be in an office at 8 a.m., but I get to be at the theater at 8 p.m. It is a pretty sweet gig. The power of theater comes from its ability to surprise. Once or twice a season, I am treated to an unexpected discovery: While movies so often are cut, polished, CGI'd and market-researched to death, even the most commercial piece of tourist-bait theater -- lookin' at you, ""Evita"" -- contains within it an element of unpredictability. The audiences, unfortunately, are drearily predictable. It's the old one-in-every-family phenomenon: They will be late. They will talk. Their cell phones will ring, and some of them, by God, will answer them. They will text, and they may even play a few rounds of Words with Friends during the third act. They are the enemy. They are depressing not because their bad manners surprise us but because they do not surprise us. I found myself in the news this week after offering a surprise of my own at a New York theater: The woman seated next to me was on her phone throughout most of the show. (It was ""Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812,"" in case you're wondering, a musical based on ""War and Peace."" You know what show you shouldn't see in New York if you have the attention span of a goldfish? One based on ""War and Peace."") When she was not on her phone, she and her friends were engaged in a four-part imitation of a ""Sex and the City"" brunch conversation. I asked her nicely -- more than once -- but she did not respond to courtesy. She said: ""Just don't look."" So I took her phone from her and tossed it. There was a moment of wonderful, shocked silence. She salvaged such self-respect as she could -- which is to say, she slapped me -- and then stalked off in search of her phone. A few minutes later, I was visited by an annoyed gentleman in a black suit and soon enough found myself out on the street. Yes, it was worth it. In part, I blame the theater managers. If you seat people who show up late, they will show up late. One or two high-profile ejections a month would go a long way toward beating some sense into the theater-going public. But you can never design a perfect protocol. Audiences must behave. People are awful, of course -- somebody once observed that every civilization faces a barbarian invasion every generation in the form of its children -- and the Broadway and off-Broadway crowd is full of miscreants. Theater is New York and New York is theater, and New York is not much like the rest of the country. (Shake Shack, a summertime favorite in Madison Square Park, has a menu for dogs.) New York is one of the world capitals of self-importance. And, with the possible exception of Washington, there is no city in the country where self-importance is more disconnected from actual importance. If I could buy New Yorkers for what they're worth and sell them for what they think they're worth, I'd own Fifth Avenue from Saks to Harlem. That guy whispering into his cell phone? He isn't getting the news that little Timmy finally has a donor for his heart transplant; he's just another schmuck having a schmuck conversation with schmucks elsewhere. That guy tapping away on his smartphone isn't restructuring the derivatives markets; he's playing ""Angry Birds."" The lady to my right, I am willing to bet, was not receiving her orders from the Impossible Missions Force, and her phone did not self-destruct. I destructed it. And I am not sorry. I am advised that what I did was almost certainly a crime. And if the law, in its majesty, should decide that I need to spend a night in jail over this episode, then I will be happy to do so. But I think of it as an act of criticism. Occasionally, a shocking gesture is called for, perhaps even a histrionic one. I may have met conventional-grade rudeness with thermonuclear counterforce, but I did it in the interests of civility, violating standards to preserve them. Theater-goers on Twitter jokingly compared me to Batman: Not the hero Gotham deserves, the hero it needs. I don't know about that: Grumpiness is not much of a superpower. But we will live in exactly as rude and coarse a world as we will tolerate, and I do not intend to tolerate very much. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kevin Williamson.","Theater critic Kevin Williamson is sick of rude audiences who talk or text during plays .

"(CNN) -- This is ballet, but not as you know it. For one, there's not a ballerina in sight. Tutus have been replaced with bare chests and tights, pointe shoes have been tossed aside for slippers, and delicate dÃ©colletages have been swapped for beefed-up biceps. Once the traditional arena of lithe ladies, ballet is seeing an increasing number of all-male shows -- in one of the biggest shake-ups in the history of the profession. Men in motion . ""My attempt is to show a century of male dance in a hundred minutes,"" said Ukrainian-born Ivan Putrov, the creator of ""Men in Motion,"" an ambitious all-male production featuring 15 short dances. ""Just as you hear about the feminist movement and how women gained the right to vote, well men gained the right of center stage,"" added the 34-year-old former London Royal Ballet dancer, who has toured the groundbreaking show across Europe. Think of ballet, and you'll most likely conjure images of pirouetting ladies in elegant tutus -- not performances ""full of testosterone,"" as ""Men in Motion"" dancer Daniel Proietto describes it. ""For the last 100 years everything has changed -- men are bringing new creativity, new ways of doing things to the stage."" Swan Lake . It's not the first show to be given a men-only makeover. When British choreographer Matthew Bourne's all-male Swan Lake premiered in London almost two decades ago, it was considered revolutionary in the traditional world of ballet. Bourne studied the movements of real swans for the show, displaying both their ungainly flapping and menacing power through dance. ""It's not twee and pretty, that's for sure,"" said Jonathan Ollivier, who plays The Swan in what has since become one of the longest-running ballets in London's West End. ""We are bare-chested, we have feathered legs, and this quite striking beak on our face. It's quite masculine. All the guys are pumped up and it is very serious."" Smashing stereotypes . That's not to say male ballet dancers can't also be beautiful and tender on stage. ""I think there is always the concept of the ballerina who is this delicate creature, and men are the opposite -- we jump higher, we have more stamina, we are stronger,"" said Argentinian Proietto. ""But at the same time maybe when you see us in a fragile setting we can also be delicate."" ""That's what you normally don't see...my best memories of my father are when he cries, so of course I love when I can see a man communicating that on stage. I think that is very, very powerful. Perhaps even more than when I see him jump and being strong physically."" Beyond 'Billy Elliot' Despite the phenomenal strength needed to be a ballet dancer, there remains a perception of it, at least in the West, as a woman's profession -- but this is changing, says Putrov. ""I went to the opening night of Billy Elliot the musical,"" he explained. ""Some of the stories that are told are so true and it is more common than you can imagine."" ""People might think of beautiful ballerinas on pointe shoes and in tutus but dance in general, at least in Britain, is the second most popular activity in schools after football -- so it is not true that men don't dance."" And if Putrov has his way, we'll be seeing a lot more of them taking center stage in the future. Watch: Carlos Acosta -- from the barrio to the ballet .

"(CNN) -- Just about every time an article about ""sugar"" is published, I get frustrated because of the effort by some to falsely target sugar. Although reporters often ask the Sugar Association for scientific facts and data regarding sugar to use in their stories, the information we provide is rarely included. Often, it's completely ignored because it does not support the preconceived focus of their article. Thus, a tremendous amount of factual, scientifically verified information about all-natural sugar (sucrose) is being left out of today's conversation. And, sugar, the natural version, is too often confused with the more prevalent man-made sweeteners like high-fructose corn syrup. That's misleading for consumers. And it's bad for advancing a real debate about solving the serious problem of obesity in America. Opinion: The sweet secret that could kill you . I'm talking about a legitimate, credible discussion, supported by government data and independent scientific research, not hysteria and misinformation. Those using inflammatory and baseless phrases like ""toxic"" are often more concerned with a sound bite to sensationalize an article or TV appearance, and their claims have more to do with boosting their social media following or selling books than resolving genuine issues of public health. Targeting sugar alone is disingenuous, at best. The most recent example of this trend is a study that appeared in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, and the media storm that ensued, condemning sugar as a contributing factor to cardiovascular disease. Consider this: The authors of the study itself concede that an observational study like theirs is not proof of cause and effect. The authors fail to note the weakness of the self-reported data they used to estimate intake levels of ""added sugar."" This inadequacy is demonstrated by the fact that study participants self-reporting higher levels of physical activity had a greater, not the expected lower, risk of cardiovascular disease. And the study's authors also simplistically lumped together all caloric sweeteners as ""added sugar"" rather than identifying them individually (more on this in a minute). Yet that didn't stop headlines like ""Sugar tied to fatal heart problems"" or ""Eating too much sugar may be killing you."" Sugar not only makes you fat, it may make you sick . These headlines -- and many others resulting from the study -- underscore the problem consumers are facing when seeking factual information on health. Having worked with the U.S. sugar industry for more than a decade, I am becoming more and more dismayed by those habitually providing a megaphone for what ""some"" folks are saying while barely giving a thought to whether these claims reflect a consensus view that is either prevailing among qualified experts or is scientifically correct. Although obsessing about sugar as ""the"" problem in our diets gives headline writers everywhere the chance to grab our attention with provocative puns, it undermines the worth of important work regarding other dietary and health concerns. It takes the focus and resources away from us supporting scientifically verified, proven interventions dealing with obesity. The fact is that American per capita consumption of real sugar (sucrose) is lower now than it was 40 years ago by approximately one-third (34%). So of all the things we need to worry about in this world, ""higher"" consumption of sugar is not among them. Because we've been consuming less of it for decades. And when critics talk about consumption of ""sugar-sweetened"" or ""sugary beverages,"" they are often inaccurately lumping sugar -- from sugar cane and sugar beets -- with man-made sweeteners like high-fructose corn syrup. Sugar and high-fructose corn syrup, for example, are different sweeteners. They are molecularly different. With U.S. Department of Agriculture data showing that more than 90% of the caloric sweetener used in beverages in the United States is such corn syrup, not sugar, how can the media, or anyone, continue to call them ""sugar-sweetened beverages""? So Americans just need to remember: Only sucrose, or sugar, is sugar. Sugar has been consumed safely for centuries and, when consumed in moderation, has been and should continue to be part of a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle. That's a fact. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andy Briscoe.","Andy Briscoe says media reports involving natural sugar are often misleading .

"(CNN) -- Red Bull and Ferrari have pulled out of the Formula One Teams Association due to conflict over proposals for cost cutting in the elite motorsport. The umbrella group was formed at Ferrari's Maranello base in 2008 to help the teams protect their interests in talks with ruling body the FIA and F1's rights holders. While the Italian marque's president Luca di Montezemolo was the initial leader of FOTA, since late 2009 it has been headed by McLaren chief Martin Whitmarsh. Hispania left FOTA at the end of the team's first season in 2010, and the latest defections mean that nine of the 12 teams on the grid are part of the group. Venezuelan retains Williams drive for 2012 . ""Formula One, like the rest of the world, is currently going through a delicate period. Ferrari wants to work with all parties for the future of a sport that expresses the highest level of motorsport technology,"" the 31-time world champions said in a statement on Friday. ""We must return to a situation where F1 is really a test bed for advanced technological research, the results of which can be transferred to Granturismo cars. In addition, we must not forget that this sport must become more user-friendly and more accessible to the general public. ""Furthermore, it cannot be the only professional sport where it is practically impossible to do any training: the number of days of testing must be increased so that the drivers, especially the young ones who lack experience and the teams, can be adequately prepared, as well as providing more opportunities for them to come into contact with spectators and sponsors."" Red Bull have dominated F1 in the past two years, winning the constructors' title twice as Sebastian Vettel became the sport's youngest double world champion. ""Red Bull Racing can confirm it has served notice to withdraw from FOTA,"" the UK-based Austrian outfit said in a statement on Friday. ""The team will remain committed to finding a solution regarding cost saving in Formula One."" Ferrari -- whose last world title was the 2008 constructors' crown -- will also continue to work within F1's Resource Restriction Agreement, which aims to control costs. ""It was a difficult decision and a great deal of thought went into it. It was taken reluctantly after analyzing the current situation and the stalemate when it came to debate on some issues that were at the core of why the association was formed,"" the team said. ""Some of the major achievements of the association during these years, also worked out in conjunction with the FIA, centered around cost reduction, which was of significant benefit to everyone, the big teams and the small ones. ""Ferrari was on the front line in this area, even before the birth of FOTA, and it intends to continue down this route to ensure the sustainability of the sport in the long term. ""Now however, it is necessary to find some new impetus to move it along because FOTA's drive has run its course, despite the excellent work of current president Martin Whitmarsh in trying to reach agreement between the various positions for the common good.""","World champion marques withdraw from the F1 teams association .

"(CNN) -- It was late morning on Saturday and the day so far had been relatively calm. Fears of widespread bloody clashes during Thailand's election process had failed to turn into reality. We had decided to go to a suburb of Bangkok, an area called Lak Si, where I had heard a group of pro-election campaigners were marching to the Lak Si administration office where voting ballots for that constituency were kept. That office had been blocked by anti-election protestors. A few hours later, the pro-election protesters arrived but kept a distance of several hundred meters from their counterparts. All of a sudden, I heard the sound of firecrackers being thrown back and forth though I couldn't work out exactly where the noise was coming from. Then -- the sound of a gunshot. I saw pro-election protesters flinch and throw themselves to the ground. Things went quiet for a bit. Then some pro-election protesters started gathering together, and I ran over to see what was going on. It was a man sitting on the floor. He was shot in the chest, but could still talk. What had been a relatively peaceful protest that day turned violent with no warning and this man the first casualty. More was to come. The pro-election protesters started to yell at an anti-government protest group who had just arrived with a big loudspeaker truck on the other side of Lak Si intersection in Bangkok. One pro-election protester told me the shot was fired from that side. I thought I should withdraw, and decided to catch up with my colleagues, who had just crossed the road. As I crossed the road, a speaker on the truck said ""Please keep hidden on the left side of our truck, and walk slowly."" I moved behind a square-shaped cement barrier, and thought maybe I could put my camera on top of the barrier and take a steady shot as the truck passed by. That's when a group of three masked men ran from behind the truck. I thought, ""That's strange, their leader said to walk along the truck."" That's when I realized the men were running toward me, toward my camera. They saw me for sure. The group of men reached my position and there was only a low cement barrier between us. Suddenly they started firing handguns in the direction of the pro-election protesters. One man carried a large green bag, which looked to conceal a rifle. I was sitting upright, but I dropped my back to the ground immediately. All I could think was that I had to keep my camera recording. Would my lens capture the gunmen? Once I felt like I had gotten the footage, my next thought was: ""I should get out of here? After all, the gunfire was still going."" I peeked my head from behind the cement barricade and I asked a nearby man, ""Can I leave, please? Or should I stay?"" Only after I had spoken, did I notice the pistol in his hand. His face looked stern. ""You journalist, don't film this. If I have to destroy your camera, then don't blame me."" So I had to put my camera down. Apart from myself, there were at least a half-dozen other cameramen who were stuck and trapped along these gunmen, for 40 minutes or more. Eventually I tried again. I asked the same man, ""Is it a good time for us to leave?"" He said okay. ""Keep yourself lower than the barriers and crawl."" So we left -- I went first. We crawled along the road, keeping next to the cement barriers along the way. I crawled past six pistol-wielding gunmen who were mingling with anti-government protesters. Some gunmen wore masks, some didn't. They were firing toward the pro-election protesters the whole time. I could feel bullets zipping not far past my ears. While crawling, I also saw another two gunmen with rifles, unmasked. They, too, were shooting in the direction of the pro-election protesters. In the end, it probably took about 15 minutes to reunite with my colleagues at the other side of the road. But it felt like forever. And though only a small moment in what has been months of protests, it served as a reminder and a warning that the situation is far from resolved in Thailand -- that passions remain high and that bloodshed is sadly only a moment of madness away.","CNN reporter Kocha Olarn saw pro-election protester shot in the chest .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Queen Elizabeth II has become a YouTube hit after apparently losing her temper with Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi during a photocall for G-20 leaders. Just after this photo was taken, the Queen, center, appears to get annoyed with Silvio Berlusconi. The queen joined the G-20 leaders for an official photo to mark the summit. After the photo is taken, Berlusconi can be heard yelling: ""Mr Obama,"" at the U.S. president in an attempt to get his attention. The noise appears to rile the queen who turns in Berlusconi's direction, shrugs her shoulders and says: ""What is it? Why does he have to shout?"" A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman Friday rejected suggestions the queen was annoyed with Berlusconi. She told the British Press Association the reception was ""warm and friendly"" and said everyone involved was good-natured. ""It was loud and jolly and very jovial, there were no gaffes and no offense taken."" Italian media have labeled the incident another Berlusconi gaffe. Berlusconi is renowned for his gaffes. In November he described Obama as ""handsome and suntanned."" He was also forced to issue an apology to his wife, Veronica Lario, in 2007 after she read reports of him approaching several women at an awards dinner and declaring: ""If I wasn't married, I would marry you straight away."" Lario received the apology after sending a letter criticizing her husband to a newspaper in which she said his behavior was ""unacceptable"" and ""damaging to my dignity.""","Queen Elizabeth a YouTube hit after apparently losing her temper with Berlusconi .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- A driverless van has completed the longest-ever trip by an unmanned vehicle, beginning in Italy and arriving in China, covering 13,000 kilometers (8,077 miles), researchers said. The van arrived at the Shanghai World Expo on Thursday, after leaving Italy on July 20. The three-month trip took the van through Eastern Europe, Russia and Kazakhstan; across China through the Gobi Desert; and finally along the Great Wall, before arriving for a celebration at the expo. The driverless van relied solely on electricity. See more of CNN's tech coverage . The vehicle weathered three months of rain, blizzards and sun, and arrived in Shanghai with no major problems, according to researchers tracking its progress. The van even stopped to pick up hitchhikers outside of Moscow. ""We are really happy. It's a real milestone in our field of vehicular robotics,"" said lead researcher Alberto Broggi. The van, designed by Italian tech company Vislab, featured 12 refined sensors, including cameras, a carbon dioxide sensor, a GPS device and an off-road laser scanner. ""This driverless trip to China shows how science can capture people's imagination through achievements that would recently have been unthinkable ... [and] provide major environmental and economic benefits,"" said Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, head of research, innovation and science for the European Commission. See more of CNN's special coverage of China . The record-setting journey comes in amid of major developments in driverless vehicle technology. Earlier this month, Google announced that its self-driving vehicle had successfully traveled about 350 miles [563 kilometers] from its headquarters in Mountain View, California, to Santa Monica, California. Google, which engages in energy-related businesses along with its core Internet search-engine service, says its self-driving cars have logged more than 140,000 miles. General Motors, Volkswagen and Stanford University are also developing driverless vehicles. No maps were used as Vislab's van traveled from Italy, then off-road through much of Siberia and China. The van topped out at 37 miles per hour and traveled about four hours a day to allow for adequate battery recharging. As for human intervention during the van's three-month journey, ""We had to intervene manually only on limited occasions, such as in the Moscow traffic jams and when passing toll stations,"" said lead researcher Broggi, who also is a professor at Italy's University of Parma. Two engineers rode in the van to prevent dangerous situations. The vehicle was part of a four-vehicle caravan, which included a leading van that was occasionally driven by two engineers, but mostly operated without human guidance. From Italy to Russia to China, the driverless van baffled onlookers. During a special demonstration on the outskirts of Moscow on September 10, a police officer approached the vehicle as it maneuvered in a pedestrian zone, only to find a driver missing. ""He realized there was no driver!"" engineers wrote on the van's official trip blog. ""He then looked around and tried to find a clue of what was happening. He really seemed puzzled!"" ""We talked to him ... explained this is a big test,"" Broggi said. ""It was extremely difficult, but in the end we avoided getting the first ticket to an autonomous vehicle."" Other challenges along the way included replacing a 430-kilogram battery in Moscow, lengthy and complicated border crossings due to customs clearances, and several frigid nights camping along the van's route in Siberia. ""We weren't worried about not making it,"" though, Broggi said. ""This big trip was an intermediary step in a longer process. We have something new planned for 2012."" The European Research Council primarily funded the expedition, to develop technology to increase road safety and fuel efficiency by supplementing driver decisions at the wheel. The project used low-cost technologies that could be integrated in most current vehicles' chassis, researchers said. More than 1.2 million people die annually in auto crashes, according to the World Health Organization.","Van arrives at the Shanghai World Expo on Thursday .

"(CNN) -- Do you need to be a jockey to ride a horse? Do you need to be a doctor to run a hospital? Maybe not in all cases, but a new study suggests that you will be more successful in management if you have skills specific to your realm of operations. These days the trend is very much toward professional managers -- executives who swap industries as they please. However, in the rarified world of Formula One at least, it appears that it pays to employ from within. And with an average annual team budget of $173 million, there is pressure to get it right. ""Former top drivers, such as Jean Todt, consistently turn into successful Formula One bosses -- even when we account for factors such as the resources available to each team,"" says Amanda Goodall of Britain's Cass Business School. Webber: F1's joker in the pack? Goodall co-authored a study which discovered that F1 teams managed by individuals who know the sport inside out win twice as many races as their general manager counterparts. Examining all 18,000 F1 races from 1950-2011, the study revealed that former drivers and mechanics are significantly more successful than those with degrees in engineering or who were managers by trade. Todt, for example, is now president of motorsport's ruling body the FIA. Following a 15-year rally driving career and a stint as Peugeot's director of racing, he joined Ferrari's F1 setup. Having been responsible for bringing Michael Schumacher to the team, the Frenchman later became the Scuderia's chief executive. While he presided over multiple world titles, his 2008 replacement Stefano Domenicali -- a business school graduate -- has struggled to repeat the success of the Schumacher era, winning nothing. ""We can see why comparative newcomers like Red Bull and Sauber are doing so well in Formula One. These teams may not have a 50-year history like Ferrari but they are led by hands-on experts with deep intuition,"" Goodall said. Red Bull, formed from the Jaguar team in 2005, has dominated the past two years with world titles in both driver and manufacturer categories. The Austrian-owned marque is led by Christian Horner, who started out as a racing driver in F1's development divisions before running his own team in his mid-20s. Sauber's restored fortunes have come since founder Pete Sauber rebought the team from BMW in 2009 -- though the 68-year-old is gradually handing over control to chief executive Monisha Kaltenborn, whose background is in law. The authors of the Cass report say the study shows that being a capable general manager may no longer be sufficient, and that employees respond better to leaders who have a deep understanding of their trade. In fact, a previous study conducted by the same authors discovered that hospitals headed by doctors perform better than those led by professional managers. ""From an early age, driver-leaders develop technical knowledge about the underlying activity of grand prix racing,"" the F1 study states. ""They acquire extensive experience in formulating driving tactics, and are able to make decisions under time pressure and stress. This inherent knowledge and industry expertise may, we suggest, inform organizational strategy when drivers become principals. ""We also argue that former drivers may appear more credible to their F1 team colleagues, which extends their influence. Finally, because of a shared value system between the team and leader, driver-leaders may create a more appropriate work environment for the team.""","Study shows ""expert"" leaders win twice as many F1 races as their rivals .

"(CNN) -- With plastic bottles melting on court and players vomiting during matches, the heat is on in at the Australian Open, though organizers have cut the women some slack. As temperatures soared, China's Peng Shuai blamed the conditions after she cramped up and was sick during her defeat to Kurumi Nara of Japan. At one point temperatures at Melbourne Park rose to 42.2 Celsius (108 Fahrenheit), with world No. 2 Victoria Azarenka describing playing on the Rod Laver Arena court as like ""dancing in a frying pan."" It got so hot, organizers introduced the tournament's ""extreme heat"" contingency plan which allows for an extended break between the second and third set for the women. The decision on whether or not to suspend play lies with tournament director Wayne McKewen, who uses a scale which factors in temperature, humidity and wind. ""We have to reach a minimum threshold and have a forecast that it will be sustained for a reasonable time,"" McKewen said in a statement. ""That didn't happen. While conditions were hot and uncomfortable, the relatively low level of humidity ensured play would continue."" Despite searing heat, double defending champion Azarenka kept her cool, surviving a tough first set before going on to beat Swedish world No. 91 Johnanna Larsson 7-6 (7-2) 6-2. The Belorussian would have liked organizers to close the roof on Melbourne Park's showpiece court to protect the players, with the blazing sun making conditions hot under foot. ""When I went out on the court I was just curious what the temperature was,"" the 24-year-old, who will play Barbora Zahlavova Strycova in the second round, told reporters. ""Because even though it was windy, the wind was hot. You normally expect some freshness ... but it just didn't come, from anywhere."" Also playing in marginally favorable conditions earlier in the day, former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki made light work of Lourdes Dominguez Lino. Tenth seed Wozniacki, who recently announced her engagement to golfer Rory McIlroy, needed just 67 minutes to wrap up a 6-0 6-2 win over the Spaniard, although the searing heat did take its toll on her drinks bottle. ""The first set I thought I managed to keep my head cool,"" said the Dane, who advanced to a meeting with American Christina McHale. ""Every time in the changeovers, ice bags, ice towels, everything; and then in the second set I could feel they were starting to heat up even more. ""I put the bottle down on the court and it started melting a little bit underneath, the plastic, so you knew it was warm. ""But it was warm for both of us, and it was great that I managed to finish it off in two sets and it wasn't too long."" Maria Sharapova took to the court for the final match of day two, the third seed's 6-3 6-4 victory over American Bethanie Mattek-Sands secured in cooler temperatures once the sun had set. But fifth seed Agnieszka Radwanska was made to sweat for her place in the second round. The Pole, a quarterfinalist at Melbourne Park in each of the last three years, cruised through the first set before overcoming a fight back from Kazakhstan's Yulia Putintseva to win 6-0 5-7 6-2. There were no such problems for world No. 8 Jelena Jankovic, with the Serb cruising to a 6-1 6-2 victory against Japan's Misaki Doi.","Temperatures rise to 107.96 degrees Fahrenheit at the Australian Open .

"(CNN) -- He's unlikely to break a world record or even win a medal but New Zealand's Blake Skjellerup is likely to generate plenty of headlines if he gets to February's Winter Olympics. The speed skater is currently the only openly gay athlete who could compete in Sochi, at a Games already tinged by Russia's controversial laws on homosexuality. The June ruling prohibits the distribution of information to minors promoting same-sex relationships and the public discussion of gay rights, but Skjellerup has promised not to shy away from the issue. Instead, he's planning to tackle it head on. And if Russian President Vladimiar Putin, who signed off the bill, is sincere when recently saying that all competitors will be welcome -- ""regardless of nationality, race or sexual orientation"" -- then the 28-year-old's potential arrival will be the acid test. Especially if he starts wearing the rainbow badge that has been made especially for him, one bearing the words ""Blake Skjellerup -- Proud 2014"". ""I will express my feelings and emotions openly (in Sochi),"" the Kiwi told CNN. ""I am not going to go back into the closet in any way. I am proud of who I am. ""Yes, Sochi is about my competitive nature -- it's about me competing as a speed skater -- but on the other hand, it's about standing up for what I believe in and being proud of that."" Skjellerup came out after competing at the last Winter Olympics, saying he had chosen not to do so beforehand in order to avoid unwanted distractions in his build-up. In Vancouver four years ago, he reached the quarterfinals in the men's 1000m short-track event -- and he will soon find out if he has qualified for the 500m at next year's Games. Another reason given for not coming out prior to the 2010 Games was a reluctance to alienate sponsors and in August, Skjellerup launched an online campaign to generate funds for his Sochi participation. This was predicated upon a desire to represent the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) community, with the Kiwi explaining in a promotional video that ""love is a human right"" and decrying the fact that the act of same-sex couples holding hands in Russia could lead to a jail term. He has also produced a badge that he will sell to raise funds for his participation and which he intends to wear in Russia, despite the punishments that could come his way. ""The idea behind the pins is about showing a part of me that I am very proud to be,"" explained a man who lives and trains in the Canadian city Calgary. ""In my mind, it is no different to (sporting) a cross or a cultural tattoo. The pin is something I can wear to show that I am proud of who I am and also offer solidarity to the people of Russia, because it is not fair what is happening to them. ""I am in their country, I should respect that but I respect them, because they are the ones who are being oppressed -- and they are the ones who are having to hide who they are and having to live their lives in a way that isn't healthy."" In August, Human Rights First issued a report on the anti-gay ""propaganda"" law and on the state of LGBT rights in Russia called ""Convenient Targets."" Since 2006, it says, 10 regional legislative bodies have adopted laws prohibiting the ""propaganda"" of homosexuality but those laws have seldom been applied. It also reports that during the first half of 2013 there were 13 beatings and one murder ""motivated by anti-gay bias."" In 2012, there were 12 attacks; in 2011, three. On a visit to inspect Sochi's facilities in September, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) dismissed concerns over the bill. ""As long as the Olympic Charter is respected, we are satisfied. This is the case,"" said Jean-Claude Killy, who headed up the visiting IOC delegation. There have been widespread calls for a boycott of the Sochi Olympics in light of the anti-gay laws, but Skjellerup takes a very different view. ""I think being Sochi is a good thing -- not just for me but for this human rights movement,"" he said. ""It's something that shouldn't be there, and the fact that it came into law in 2013 is absurd. ""I don't know what they were thinking nor what the intent is behind this. It makes no sense to me.""","Openly gay speed skater Blake Skjellerup says he will stand up for his beliefs in Sochi .

"Tehran (CNN) -- His wife advised him not to go. His friends said it was too dangerous. But in 2011 veteran American football coach Dan Gaspar ignored the warnings and traveled to the Islamic Republic of Iran -- Washington's longtime political nemesis -- to help Iran's national football team qualify for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. ""Sports is my life,"" said Gaspar. ""When I came to Iran it didn't have anything to do with political reasons. My personality is one of adventure and curiosity. I wanted to experience a culture in a part of the world I had never been to."" The goalkeeping coach's journey to Iran is the latest chapter in an international career that's taken the 58-year-old from the amateur football leagues in the U.S. state of Connecticut -- where he was born -- to the football capitals of the world. The Portuguese-American's resume includes stints with Major League Soccer's NY/NJ MetroStars and the Portuguese national team -- featuring megastar Cristiano Ronaldo -- which qualified for the 2010 World Cup. In 2011, Gaspar's friend and former colleague Carlos Queiroz was named head of coach of Iran's national football team. Soon after, Queiroz invited Gaspar to join the coaching staff in Iran. At the time, the Iranian government was locked in a bitter political feud with Washington. Iran regularly called the U.S. ""The Great Satan"". U.S. politicians frequently described Iran as a rogue nation led by a radical regime, secretly building a nuclear bomb. When discussing Washington's conflict with Tehran, U.S. President Barack Obama said that ""all options are on the table"", suggesting an attack against Iran was not out of the question. Despite the ominous climate Gaspar accepted the offer -- a decision his wife wasn't quite comfortable with. ""She was shocked,"" Gaspar said. ""She was concerned as most family members were."" Gaspar admits he had concerns too. ""When we first arrived, we didn't know how to behave and how to react,"" he said. During his first few months Gaspar didn't socialize much and rarely left his apartment, except for trips to football practice. But Gaspar says he steadily started feeling comfortable. He says he learned his impressions of Iran, created mostly by the media, didn't quite match reality. ""When you listen to the news and you read the news, you see things. Sometimes during commercials I step off my couch and look out of the balcony and it's not what I am seeing, it's not what I am reading, it's not what I am hearing."" Gaspar says what he has observed during his stay in Iran is a nation full of generous people who love their country, their food and their football team. One of his most memorable moments was meeting former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. ""He walked on to the pitch and asked everyone to sit down, and then he himself sat down on the grass,"" Gaspar said. ""I thought it was interesting how he put himself on the same level as everyone else. At the end of the day -- I saw him as another human being."" In recent months, Gaspar's stay in Iran has coincided with a push by Tehran to improve relations with Washington, as moderate President Hassan Rouhani tries to settle Iran's nuclear dispute with the west. ""Right now more than ever there seems to be a lot of hope and optimism and a sense of energy that things will get better,"" says Gaspar. ""For me I believe in peace, and, if peace is an end result, then that's best for the world."" But the highlight of Gaspar's Iranian adventure came on the night of June 18, when Iran's national football team recorded a 1-0 win over South Korea to qualify for the World Cup for only the fourth time. The win sparked frenzied celebrations on the field and in the streets of Tehran. ""There were a lot of tears, a lot of hugging. You can't describe it. Only a few privileged people have the opportunity to climb the mountain and go to the big dance in Brazil in 2014."" Gaspar says his only disappointment that night was not being able to share the win with his wife and family back in America. His contract in Iran runs through World Cup in Brazil next June and July. He says his focus is to help Iran impress at the tournament and then return to America with some remarkable memories.

"(CNN) -- A Tibetan student who died after setting herself on fire in western China had been experiencing difficulties following a head injury, the official Chinese news agency reported Wednesday. The student, Tsering Kyi, was the first of three Tibetans who reportedly self-immolated between Saturday and Monday. It is the only one of the three alleged acts so far acknowledged by the Chinese authorities. Tibetan advocacy groups say the self-immolations -- more than 20 of which are reported to have taken place in the past year -- are to protest Chinese rule. They follow an increase in security measures by the Chinese authorities in response to unrest among Tibetans in western areas of China in recent months and ahead of the sensitive anniversary of protests by Tibetan monks four years ago that ended in bloodshed. Activists say the disturbing acts reflect an increasingly repressive environment under China's control. Beijing rejects accusations of oppression of Tibetans, saying that under its rule living standards have greatly improved for the Tibetan people. Chinese officials have described the self-immolations as ""extreme"" acts. The report Wednesday by Xinhua, the government news agency, suggested Tsering Kyi, 20, had been troubled by the aftereffects of a head injury before she set herself on fire in the county of Maqu, or Machu in Tibetan, in Gansu Province. ""She was sent to hospital and has had occasional fainting spells,"" Xinhua reported, citing the local police. ""The medical treatment held up her studies and her school scores began to decline, which put a lot of pressure on her and made her lose her courage for life and study."" A local official said similarities in the self-immolations point to a transparent political motive and behind-the-scenes orchestration, Xinhua reported. The victims were used by separatists to create chaos, according to Wu Zegang, chief of the Aba prefecture in Sichuan province. On Sunday, a mother of four named Rinchen died after setting herself alight in front of Kirti Monastery in the county of Aba, which Tibetans call Ngaba, in Sichuan Province, according to Tibetan advocacy groups like London-based Free Tibet. And on Monday, an 18-year-old Tibetan man named Dorje burned himself to death in a nomadic area of Aba, according to advocacy groups. Local officials reached by telephone declined to comment on the matter. It was not possible to independently verify the accounts of the self-immolations. China restricts journalists' access to the areas where they have been taking place. This month will mark the fourth anniversary of protest marches by Tibetan monks in Lhasa that ended violently in 2008. Tibetans say the situation escalated to violence when Chinese police beat monks who had been protesting peacefully; Chinese authorities claim Tibetans launched attacks on Chinese businesses. Officially the death toll is under 20; Tibetans in exile say the death toll is near 150.","China says a Tibetan who set herself on fire had lost ""her courage for life""

"Srinagar, India (CNN) -- A soldier at an army camp in Indian-administered Kashmir killed five of his colleagues Thursday before turning his gun on himself, the military said. The soldier opened fire with an automatic rifle in the barracks of the camp in the town of Safapora, roughly 30 kilometers (19 miles) north of the capital, Srinagar, said military spokesman Lt. Col. N.N. Joshi. An investigation into the shooting has been ordered, Joshi said. Kashmir is a mountainous region that has long been the subject of dispute between India and Pakistan. Both sides keep large numbers of troops in the region. Since 1989, India has also been fighting against a violent separatist movement in the mainly Muslim area it controls, a conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people. Previous cases of members of the Indian Army and paramilitary forces in Kashmir turning their guns on their colleagues have taken place over the years. Authorities have attributed previous shootings to stress caused by long duty hours and protracted separation from families. Officials have introduced measures like long periods of leave and recreational facilities to try to tackle the problem. Journalist Mukhtar Ahmad reported from Srinagar, and CNN's Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.","A soldier opens fire with an automatic rifle in a camp north of Srinagar .

"(CNN) -- Panama has released 32 of 35 detained crew members of a North Korean ship that last year tried to cross the Panama Canal with weapons smuggled aboard, an official said Thursday. Panamanian Attorney General Ana Belfon said that the 32 would be deported Cuba or to other countries. The captain and two other officers of the cargo ship, the Chong Chon Gang, will continue to be held and face charges of arms smuggling, said Nathaniel Murgas, head prosecutor in organized crime. Panama stopped the ship in July and authorities found undeclared weaponry from Cuba -- including MiG fighter jets, anti-aircraft systems and explosives -- buried under thousands of bags of sugar. The Cuban government said the shipment consisted of ""obsolete"" weapons being sent to North Korea for repairs before being returned to Cuba. But Panama said they violated United Nations arms sanctions on North Korea. Because it is pursuing nuclear weapons, North Korea is banned by the United Nations from importing and exporting most weapons. Earlier this month, Panamanian authorities said that North Korea would pay a fine of more than half a million dollars for the ship's release. Authorities had originally imposed a $1 million fine on North Korea over the shipment, which they said violated the security of the canal, a key waterway linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. That fine was reduced by a third to $666,666, Panama's Foreign Ministry said in a statement. CNN's Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","32 of 35 detained crew members are free to go, says Panama's attorney general .

"(CNNGo) -- There's a special form of loathing reserved for a building that forces you to remove your shoes, wait in line, get groped, shell out for bad food and dash in a panic to an arbitrarily changed gate before canceling your flight. But let's be clear. The most hated airports in the world are not the worst airports in the world. For that you'll have to consult Lonely Planet or fly to destinations the majority of us have little need to pin on a map or pronounce properly. Read more on CNNGo: 10 of the world's most loved airports . To come up with our admittedly unscientific list, we canvassed travel websites, blogs and message boards. And called on memories of our own travel nightmares. What follow are majorly despised international hubs (or hopefuls) that, while they may have a few staunch fans, and some have even won awards, have all inspired enough fury, flak and ""never again"" air-rage to merit a place on this list.

You can also vote for your most awful airport on our Facebook poll. 10. São Paulo-Guarulhos International, São Paulo, Brazil . Why is this place on our list after scoring third best airport in South America at the 2011 World Airport Awards? Because, shockingly enough, it turns out that corporate medal ceremonies aren't always in sync with what people are thinking when they're standing in two-hour immigration lines, suffering routinely unannounced gate changes and paying through the teeth for a stale Brazilian cheese roll and beer inside an understaffed and over-aged aviation facility. In a country where flight delays (departing or arriving) are just part of the deal, some recent numbers would give pause to the most unflappable traveler at Brazil's largest airport. Just 41 percent of all flights leave on time. Only 59 percent of flights arrive on schedule, according to Forbes. São Paulo-Guarulhos has announced plans to add runways and terminals -- what airport hasn't? -- but with nearly 30 million passengers traipsing through every year (the figure has reportedly doubled in under a decade) the urgency is palpable and, sadly enough, unsolved by upping prices at musty duty-free shops. But does this really constitute bronze medal status? When the best unofficial advice for surviving Brazil's pin-up airport is to try and learn a little Portuguese and not lose your temper, something's gotta give.

But while the big guns in Sydney, Melbourne and also-rans in Darwin, Cairns and Hobart get routinely lambasted for various inefficiencies and rip-off tactics, passengers in Western Australia have a special place in their spleens for Perth. ""The only advantage over some other airports is the lack of nearby combat,"" notes one of several miffed passengers on airportquality.com. With a reviled pair of domestic terminals (home of two-hour taxi-line queues, atrocious check-in lines, overpopulated gates and meager lounges) and a slightly more palatable international terminal five kilometers away, Perth's brittle facilities can be overwhelmed just by a trio of aircraft arriving within 20 minutes of each other. Now that an ambitious ""billion-dollar"" redevelopment project has been significantly scaled back, who would ever want to leave Changi for this place?

For a small airport in a pretty country, Tribhuvan has it all: the interminable weather delays of Boston Logan, the shoddy restroom maintenance of a Glasgow sports bar, the departure board sparsity of McMurdo Airfield and the chronic chaos of a kids' soccer match. Some airport improvements have been underway for the Visit Nepal 2011 tourism campaign, including things most passengers don't much care about (e.g., the new helicopter base). The most serious beefs with Nepal's only international airport revolve around its primitive yet officious check-in procedure, starring a roulette wheel of underpaid security agents. ""Departure is an endless game of body searches and silly questions,"" notes one passenger. ""Those who didn't have their e-tickets printed out had to argue their way in,"" says another, who was checked seven times and scolded for not having a baggage tag on a carry-on before eventually boarding. Never mind. The city's markets and surrounding mountains are lovely. 7. John F. Kennedy International, New York, United States . You'd think it would be one of the greatest humiliations any major airport would never allow itself to live down -- getting routinely abandoned by fed-up folks opting to fly out of Newark (Newark!) instead, where at least the ground staff cop less attitude and fewer people outside are pretending to be cab drivers. But, nah, JFK really couldn't care less. Every year, more than 21 million passengers stumble through worn, mid-century terminals that peaked when The Beatles arrived in the United States and rooftop parking was all the rage; JFK proudly remains the world's busiest international air gateway. So if you're not into a dim, surly, unbearably congested airport reeking with attitude and unapologetically long immigration lines -- good riddance. ""JFK had a piece of my luggage sitting in a little detention room for bags -- for over a year,"" notes one passenger. ""No one noticed it was there, until finally an observant Air France employee wondered what the dusty little green bag in the corner was."" Read more on CNNGo: Secret Report: Singapore's Chiangi Airport world's favorite . 6. Jomo Kenyatta International, Nairobi, Kenya . ""As African airports go, it's not that bad -- but as an international hub, it may be one of the worst out there."" This is the common refrain among travelers through JKIA, who either don't have the heart or the expectations to give this dated aviation facility the kind of pounding reserved for the JFKs and Charles de Gaulles of the world. Saddled with a 1958 blueprint designed for 2.5 million passengers, JKIA receives close to twice that many. Hence the airport's 2005, Three Phase, US$100 million expansion project which has seen long delays (something about the rain) and has been spinning its tires somewhere in Phase Two for the last few years. For now, that means business as usual: cramped spaces; long lines; inadequate seating; frequent power outages; tiny washrooms hiding up several flights of stairs; shabby duty free shops; overpriced food outlets; and business class lounges worthy of a shelter in mid-city Los Angeles. Sure, it's a breeze compared to Lagos. But it could be so much better. The confusing result: grateful disappointment?

"(CNN) -- When people talk about the cinematic geniuses of the 1980s, one name invariably comes up -- John Hughes. For young people growing up then and even today, the writer-director's name conjures up memories of unforgettable films. From ""Sixteen Candles"" (1984) and ""The Breakfast Club"" (1985) to ""Pretty in Pink"" (1986) and ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" (1986), Hughes was responsible for a series of films that openly and honestly explored the exhilaration and tumultuousness of adolescence. It's been nearly three decades since those movies arrived in theaters, but audiences still watch and enjoy them as if they were made yesterday. However, despite the love audiences have shown for his work, Hughes was never nominated for an Academy Award. Hughes isn't alone in being an outstanding filmmaker whose features about people under 30 were overlooked during awards season. It's unfortunate but undeniable that award shows -- and the Oscars in particular -- have a history of ignoring great movies made for and about young people. In 2013 alone, several such films received raves from critics, earning spots on ""best of"" lists. ""The Kings of Summer"" and ""The Way, Way Back"" scored approval ratings of 76% and 85% of critics, respectively, on RottenTomatoes.com, while ""The Spectacular Now,"" written by the duo behind 2009's underappreciated ""(500) Days of Summer,"" earned the approval of 92% of critics. ""Short Term 12"" received a 99% approval on Rotten Tomatoes, a higher ranking than any of this year's best picture nominees. ""Spring Breakers,"" starring James Franco and Selena Gomez, may have divided some moviegoers, but the film was also lauded for its provocative depiction of disaffected youth. And it's not for nothing that ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" was the top grossing film of 2013. Yet not one of these movies earned a single Oscar nomination. Meanwhile, ""The Wolf of Wall Street -- which secured a 77% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes -- received five Academy Award nods, including ones for best picture and best adapted screenplay. 2014 Oscars nominees list . That's not to say that ""Wolf"" didn't deserve recognition, but these other movies focused on characters in the early stages of adulthood. From three teenage boys running away from home to build a house in ""The Kings of Summer"" to a couple in their 20s managing a treatment facility for troubled children in ""Short Term 12,"" these films were about young people finding their way -- a seeming disadvantage in the academy's eyes. In an e-mail interview, Dana Polan, a professor of cinema studies at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, noted that ""Hollywood associates youth with escapist entertainment. (There) is the assumption here (no doubt, a biased one) that to be important, a theme has to be adult and mature, and youth films just don't make it."" Over the years, there have been some exceptions to this rule. For example, ""Rebel Without a Cause"" (1955) received three Oscar nominations, and ""American Graffiti"" (1973) grabbed five nods -- though both films ultimately walked away empty-handed. ""Juno,"" the 2007 comedy about a pregnant high schooler (Ellen Page), was nominated for four Oscars, including best picture and best director. The film took home the award for best original screenplay -- a win that one could argue had more to do with the quirkiness of Diablo Cody's script than the subject matter itself. Film critic Nell Minow (the Movie Mom) also observed that ""Oscar voters skew older."" ""They are more interested in stories about grown-ups and more likely to have relationships with actors and filmmakers who are 30 and older,"" Minow said via e-mail. That may be part of the reason why movies such as ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"" which delighted critics with one of 2012's best scripts and stellar performances from Logan Lerman and Emma Watson -- also didn't receive any recognition from the academy. Such snubs seem particularly egregious, partly because the academy often blatantly attempts to appeal to a younger demographic. In 2011, the Oscars chose James Franco and Anne Hathaway as hosts in hopes of attracting younger viewers. The plan failed, with the ratings dipping and the duo receiving poor reviews. The intention may have been a noble one, but perhaps a better idea would have been for the academy to begin honoring movies that speak to what it's like to be a young person today. ""The Youth,"" a song performed by MGMT on ""The Kings of Summer"" soundtrack, speaks of the transition between adolescence and adulthood. It includes the following lyrics: . The youth is starting to change. Are you starting to change?","The Academy Awards tend to overlook movies about young people .
Films such as ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" and ""Short Term 12"" were snubbed .
Some of these movies brought in more money or accolades than many Oscar nominees ."
"Hong Kong (CNN) -- There's little doubt which country Australia is targeting under its immigration scheme for the super-wealthy; the investment visa is called sub-class 188 and its permanent visa is called sub-class 888. In China, the number eight is culturally associated with wealth, prosperity and good fortune and rich Chinese nationals have been queuing up for the opportunity to live in Australia under the millionaire visa program. Since the scheme was launched in November 2012, 91% of the 545 applicants for the visas have been Chinese nationals, according to figures from the Australian Department of Immigration and Border Protection. So far, Australia has granted 65 'significant investor' visas to mainland Chinese. The requirements for getting one of the highly prized visas are simple: all you need is a clean criminal record and $A5 million ($US4.37 million) to invest. There is no language requirement, upper age limit and applicants do not even have to set up a business in Australia. Those able to park their A$5 million investment in Australia -- complying investments include government bonds, managed funds and Australian proprietary companies - for more than four years can apply for a permanent visa. Under the scheme, visa holders can keep their operations running in China if they wish. It's hoped that the move will attract a greater range of immigrants to Australia. Deloitte partner and global immigration leader Mark Wright told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation the days of Chinese investors coming to Australia simply to start a corner store or a small business were over. ""Australia is now looking to attract a larger scale of investment to feed a greater level of infrastructure development,"" Wright said. According to a report by professional services company KPMG, the patterns of Chinese investment are beginning to change, with more private Chinese investors expanding their interests in the country. The report said that while Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) accounted for 64% by value of the amount invested in Australian agriculture between 2006-2012, Chinese private investment accounted for 70% of the deal volume. ""Chinese companies are playing a more active role compared to other sectors such as mining and gas, where SOEs have dominated,"" the report said. According to immigration specialists in Hong Kong, Sydney and Melbourne -- where property prices have risen 10% and 6% respectively over the past 12 months -- are the preferred destinations for mainland Chinese immigrants. The chief executive officer of McGrath Estate Agents, John McGrath, said that Chinese buyers had boosted prices in certain sectors of the Australian property market. ""In some suburbs 90 per cent of new product will sell to Chinese buyers,"" he told the ABC. ""I think it is quite centralised in certain pockets, so I don't think it is doing great damage or harming local buyers' opportunities to buy here still."" According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the proportion of Australian immigrants born in Asia increased from 24% in 2001 to 33% in 2011. Around 6% of immigrants born overseas came from China -- the third largest group in Australia. While this group, along with Indians, represented one of the fastest growing groups, it was still a long way behind immigration from the United Kingdom, at 20%, and New Zealand at 9.1%. Immigration has been a politically charged and emotive subject in Australia, where the conservative Liberal Party won election last year partly on a platform of promising tougher policing of the country's immigration laws. Australia turns away thousands of refugees and asylum seekers but at the same time is suffering a skills and manpower shortage for manual jobs.","Chinese are the biggest group to apply for Australia's 'millionaire visa'

"(CNN) -- What happened? Tacloban, a city of more than 200,000 people on the eastern coast of the island of Leyte, suffered a catastrophic blow from Super Typhoon Haiyan, whose force brought a wall of water roaring off the Gulf of Leyte. The storm surge leveled entire neighborhoods of wooden houses and flung ships ashore. CNN's Paula Hancocks, speaking from Tacloban airport, said terminal buildings had been destroyed not by the typhoon itself but by the storm surge that went on to the city several miles away. There were a number of people killed in this area; locals said that while they were prepared for high winds and heavy rain, they were not expecting this sheer volume of water. Typhoon Haiyan: 30 members of one family missing after storm . Hancocks said one man told her: ""If we'd have been warned about a tsunami we'd have known not to be in the coastal area. But the fact they warned of a 'storm surge' ... we frankly didn't know what that was. We didn't know how deadly that was."" Aid worker Ned Olney, from Save the Children, said his charity had a team on the ground before the typhoon hit. ""What they report back that was around Tacloban was really a kill zone. They had a well-prepared emergency response team experienced at handling typhoons -- a harrowing experience -- and only just escaped. ""They were in a second-story building very solidly built of cement: The windows were blown out and the roof was ripped off. All their computers and response equipment was destroyed and they barely survived. What they said was it was remarkable that anyone survived, it was so severe."" Were warnings given and what could have been done? Before the storm hit on Friday, President Benigno S. Aquino III warned that the nation faced a calamity. However, professional storm chaser James Reynolds, founder of Earth Uncut Productions, who only just escaped from Tacloban before it struck, said it was clear locals had no idea of what was coming. ""The Philippines isn't used to getting storm surges -- it's not usually such of an issue so this would have caught people by surprise. They don't associate typhoons with the rising water levels like that."" How to help Typhoon Haiyan survivors . Asked whether he thought the message had got out that the storm could be the biggest ever to make landfall, he said, ""No, no, it can't have done."" It's difficult to know where people could have fled to. Mass evacuations are a huge logistical headache anyway, but in a country like the Philippines, comprised of several islands, the relatively poor infrastructure would make it even more difficult. Elderly people told CNN's Ivan Watson they preferred to stay put and wait it out rather than risk evacuating. No one simply anticipated such a massive storm surge. Sebastian Rhodes Stampa, United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination team leader, reiterated this point. He said one of his colleagues in the Philippines had told him that Typhoon Haiyan was similar to Typhoon Bopha which struck the southern Philippines last year, killing more than 1,000 people, but 100 times worse. ""It's the intensity of Bopha but spread over a vast area, whereas Bopha was relatively geographically constrained,"" he said. ""That gives you an idea of what the people of the Philippines are facing at the moment."" Is Typhoon Haiyan being blamed on climate change? The Philippines government says it believes the super typhoon is connected to climate change and is urging governments to find a deal at climate talks taking place in Warsaw, Poland. ""We cannot sit and stay helpless staring at this international climate stalemate. It is now time to take action. We need an emergency climate pathway,"" said Yeb Sano, head of the government's delegation to the UN climate talks, in The Guardian. Saleemul Huq, senior fellow at the International Institute for Environment and Development in London, said it was possible that weather events that once occurred every 20 or even 50 years would now strike every two years. ""Events like Haiyan could be the new norm,"" he told CNN. ""The challenge for both rich and poor countries is how to adapt to them. ""All countries will need to adapt to extreme weather conditions. Even in London, for instance, a violent storm last month blew a part of my roof. The rich may have more to lose, but they may be less well prepared for it. ""The Philippines is relatively well prepared for storms -- but there are limits as to what good the precautions will do. In this case they were simply overwhelmed, and even the storm shelters collapsed."" How do other countries fare in extreme weather events? In 1999, 10,000 people were killed when a ferocious cyclone hit eastern India. Last month, the same region, the state of Odisha, formerly known as Orissa, was once again in the crosshairs as the region's most powerful storm this century struck. But there was a much better outcome. One million Odishans were evacuated to shelters ahead of time. Only 21 people lost their lives. Thousands of others were saved. Extreme climate events may be worsening, but technology has helped to save lives. We're now better than ever predicting the scale of storms and cyclones and we're better than ever at getting the message out. Bangladesh is another country vulnerable to climate change, but it is one that has done most to adapt to future dangers, according to climate experts. Saleemul Huq, senior fellow at the International Institute for Environment and Development in London, said both countries had learned the lessons from the 2004 East Asia tsunami that left more than 200,000 people dead, according to the U.S. Geographical Survey. The main lesson learned from 2004, Huq said, is that officials need to be clear with warnings. ""You can't expect complicated warnings to be understood: saying a storm has severity of level 3 or 4 means nothing to most people. Now it's much better: you need to say simply when people must evacuate.""","Locals prepared for high winds and heavy rain, not expecting sheer volume of water .

"Washington (CNN) -- Top Democrats are prepared to short-circuit the traditional legislative process and exclude their Republican counterparts during final congressional health care deliberations, senior Democratic sources have told CNN. Democrats are trying to prevent the Republicans from using Senate rules to slow the push for final passage of a comprehensive reform bill, the sources added. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is set to discuss the politically contentious health care issue when she huddles in her office with other House Democratic leaders Tuesday afternoon. The House Democratic leadership is also likely to meet with President Obama, and plans to hold a conference call with their entire caucus. The full House of Representatives is not scheduled to return from vacation until January 12; the Senate meets January 19. Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, however, have already discussed the issue over the phone, aides said. Congressional leaders are working to merge an $871 billion Senate bill and $1 trillion House bill that differ on several critical details. Democratic leaders hope to get a bill to Obama's desk by early February, near the time of the president's State of the Union address, several Democratic sources have said. Pelosi admitted last month, however, that this deadline could slip. Should the measure that emerges from House-Senate negotiations become law, it would constitute the biggest expansion of federal health care guarantees since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid more than four decades ago. Formal House-Senate negotiations, under the ordinary legislative process, would likely have started shortly after both houses of Congress reconvene. Democratic concerns over the GOP's ability to slow the process, however, may result in the traditional process being replaced with informal, high-level talks, sources stated. In order to hold a formal conference, conferees -- members of the House and Senate -- must be formally appointed by both bodies, with resolutions passed by both the Senate and the House. One Democratic leadership aide said getting those resolutions passed in the Senate could delay and even derail Democratic efforts, because Republicans would be allowed to offer amendments and hold lengthy debates on the resolutions to appoint conferees. Many observers believe the more liberal House measure will be largely forced to conform to the Senate bill. The traditionally fractious 60-member Senate Democratic caucus struggled to unify behind a single measure, and needs to remain united in order to overcome solid Republican opposition. The different approach to financing in the House and Senate bills is one of the many differences that must now be reconciled. The House measure is paid for through a combination of a tax surcharge on wealthy Americans and new Medicare spending reductions. Individuals with annual incomes over $500,000 -- as well as families earning more than $1 million -- would face a 5.4 percent income tax surcharge. The Senate bill also cuts Medicare by roughly $500 billion. But instead of an income tax surcharge on the wealthy, it would impose a 40-percent tax on insurance companies that provide what are called ""Cadillac"" health plans valued at more than $8,500 for individuals and $23,000 for families. Proponents of the tax on high-end plans argue it's one of the most effective ways to curb medical inflation. However, House Democrats oppose taxing such policies because it would hurt union members who traded higher salaries for more generous health benefits. Back in December, Obama predicted the final bill will probably end up with a variation of both the income tax surcharge and the tax on high-end plans. ""Cadillac plans ... don't make people healthier, but just take more money out of their pockets,"" he argued in an interview with National Public Radio. The Senate bill also would hike Medicare payroll taxes on families making over $250,000; the House bill does not. Another key sticking point is the dispute over a public option. The House plan includes a public option; the more conservative Senate package would instead create nonprofit private plans overseen by the federal government. Given the reality of the 60-vote threshold in the Senate, however, there hasn't been much serious discussion among House leaders about pushing hard to keep the public option. One of the top House liberal leaders -- South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn -- recently said he could vote for a bill without the government insurance plan. ""We want a public option to do basically three things: create more choice for insurers, create more competition for insurance companies, and to contain costs,"" Clyburn said on the CBS program ""Face the Nation. ""So if we can come up with a process by which these three things can be done, then I'm all for it. Whether or not we label it a public option or not is of no consequence."" Maryland Rep. Chris Van Hollen, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said at the end of December on the show ""Fox News Sunday"" that the public option is ""not dead, but we also recognize that the Senate was able to just muster the 60 votes."" Individuals under both plans would be required to purchase coverage, but the House bill includes more stringent penalties for most of those who fail to comply. The House bill would impose a fine of up to 2.5 percent of an individual's income. The Senate plan would require individuals to purchase health insurance coverage or face a fine of up to $750 or 2 percent of his or her income, whichever is greater. Both versions include a hardship exemption for poorer Americans. Employers face a much stricter mandate under the House legislation, which would require companies with a payroll of more than $500,000 to provide insurance or pay a penalty of up to 8 percent of their payroll. The Senate bill would require companies with more than 50 employees to pay a fee of up to $750 per worker if any of its employees rely on government subsidies to purchase coverage. Abortion also has been a sticking point for both chambers. A compromise with Catholic and other conservatives in the House led to the adoption of an amendment banning most abortion coverage from the public option. It also would prohibit abortion coverage in private policies available in the exchange to people receiving federal subsidies. Senate provisions, made more conservative than initially drafted in order to satisfy Nebraska Sen. Ben Nelson, would allow states to choose whether to ban abortion coverage in plans offered in the exchanges. Individuals purchasing plans through the exchanges would have to pay for abortion coverage out of their own funds. Nelson recently warned on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that he would withdraw his support if the final bill gets changed too much from the Senate version. Despite their differences, however, the House and Senate have already reached agreement on a broad range of topics. Both chambers have agreed to subsidize insurance for a family of four making up to roughly $88,000 annually, or 400 percent of the federal poverty level. They also have agreed to create health insurance exchanges designed to make it easier for small businesses, the self-employed and the unemployed to pool resources and purchase less-expensive coverage. Both the House plan and the Senate bill would eventually limit total out-of-pocket expenses and prevent insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions. Insurers would be barred from charging higher premiums based on a person's gender or medical history. However, both bills allow insurance companies to charge higher premiums for older customers. Medicaid would be significantly expanded under both proposals. The House bill would extend coverage to individuals earning up to 150 percent of the poverty level, or roughly $33,000 for a family of four. The Senate plan ensures coverage to those earning up to 133 percent of the poverty level, or just over $29,000 for a family of four. Both the House and Senate bills would permit the creation of nonprofit private insurance cooperatives to increase competition.

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo returned to inspire Real Madrid to another record-breaking Champions League display against FC Schalke. Real had only won once in 25 previous trips to Germany but the Spanish aces buried their German hoodoo with a magnificently marauding 6-1 victory on Wednesday. Ronaldo, back to pull the strings in midfield after a three-match domestic ban, Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale all scored twice in a dazzling display. The result meant Real set a new record -- scoring in 32 consecutive Champions League matches. Ronaldo, who has scored 36 goals in 33 games, is now also this season's leading scorer in the Europe's elite cup competition with 11 goals. The Portugal captain became only the third player to pass 60 goals in the Champions League, and is now five behind Lionel Messi's 66 -- with former Real and Schalke star Raul leading the way on 71. His first at the Veltins-Arena was vintage Ronaldo; he bamboozled the Schalke defense with some fancy footwork before firing the ball into the net. His second in the 89th minute wasn't bad either as he rounded the keeper before similarly blasting the ball home. ""The team has played a lot of good games and this is one more,"" Ronaldo told reporters. ""We played well and didn't allow Schalke to play at their best. We are happy and a step away from the next round. ""The Schalke goalkeeper did very well and made good saves, but I believe in my ability and my teammates helped me a lot."" Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar had the last say on the pitch as he sent a zinging shot into the top corner as a late consolation for the home side. The goals were not quite so free-flowing in Istanbul, where Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho pitted his wits against Roberto Mancini's Galatasaray. Just two days after Mourinho criticized his attackers in a leaked private conversation, he watched his team settle for a 1-1 draw against the Turkish champions. Fernando Torres, chosen to spearhead Chelsea's strike force ahead of Samuel Eto'o, put the English Premier League leaders ahead after just eight minutes when he strolled in Cesar Azpilicueta's clever pass from a counter-attack. After a rocky first half, Mancini made a tactical switch and Galatasaray recovered their poise, pressing forward to urgent whistles from their vociferous fans. Former Chelsea player Didier Drogba, facing his old teammates for the first time since his 2012 exit, helped drive the equalizer with his muscular presence. But it was defender Aurelien Chedjou who tapped in Wesley Sneijder's corner to level the match for the Turkish champions after 64 minutes. ""In the first half we were too deep and played with fear,"" Mancini told broadcaster Sky Sports. ""But I'm happy with the second half and 1-1 is a good result."" Galatasaray had a goal disallowed in bizarre circumstances in the first half when two balls were in play at the same time. The Turkish side scored from a hastily taken throw-in but Chelsea captain John Terry was still holding the original match ball. Mourinho may have more puzzling conundrums to ponder after the first leg of the last-16 tie. With Galatasaray's defense worryingly exposed in the first half, Chelsea missed a golden chance to go home with an away victory in the bag. ""In the first half the game was our game,"" Mourinho told Sky Sports. ""I am not criticizing our strikers but in the first half we had many chances to do the second goal. ""I can't complain; the players were fantastic. The result is not amazing and the second leg will be difficult, we have to try to go through."" The decisive return leg will be played on March 18.","Real Madrid punish FC Shalke with a brilliant 6-1 display .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Fifteen people, most of them children, were killed in central Thailand on Friday after the brakes failed on a bus taking them on a school trip, sending the vehicle careening into a truck, police said. As the bus sped downhill, the students could do little but hold onto each other before the collision, according to Police Lt. Kittikarn Klomlee, who said he'd spoken to survivors of the crash. The dead included 10 schoolgirls, two female teachers, the male partner of one of the teachers, and two children of teachers, said Kittikarn, who is in charge of the police investigation into the crash. About 60 people were injured, he said, adding that he doesn't know the exact number because victims were sent to various hospitals in the area. Many of the injured survivors are in a serious condition, he said. The crash happened early Friday in Nadi district of Prachinburi province. The bus was taking school girls aged 10 to 14 from the neighboring province of Nakhon Ratchasima to the beach at the resort town of Pattaya, authorities said. Earlier Friday, a different local police official had incorrectly reported that 14 or 15 of the dead were children. Thailand has the second highest fatality rate from road crashes in the world, after Namibia, according to a report published this month by the Transportation Research Institute of the University of Michigan.

"(CNN) -- A Pakistani court has ordered a jailed American diplomat to remain in custody for 14 more days, authorities said Friday. The man's lawyer then filed a petition calling for his immediate release, saying he is covered under diplomatic immunity. Raymond Davis, who allegedly shot and killed two men, was transferred from police custody to ""judicial remand,"" said Munir Ahmed Khan, a member of the police investigative team. Pakistani law says police can only keep a suspect in custody for 14 days. After that, a judge can either release the suspect -- on bail or for lack of evidence -- or transfer him to judicial custody, which is usually a prison instead of a police station lock-up. Davis said he was attacked by the two men on January 27 who tried to rob him as he drove through a busy Lahore neighborhood, according to the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan. The U.S. State Department has demanded that Davis be freed. Under international agreements, people carrying diplomatic passports are granted diplomatic immunity, the department said. Davis' lawyer filed a petition Friday, challenging the court's jurisdiction over the case. A judge will hear arguments on February 25. The United States says Davis was assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad but was working at the U.S. Consulate in Lahore at the time of the shootings. Lahore Police Chief Aslam Tareen rejected Davis' claim that he shot the men in self-defense. ""It was clear cut murder,"" Tareen told reporters. Witnesses told police that Davis kept firing even when one of the men was running away, Tareen said. ""It means he wanted to ensure that that they were killed,""  he said. He acknowledged the two men shot were armed, and that one of them pointed his gun at Davis --  but didn't shoot. ""All the bullets were in their chamber,"" he said. The detention has strained relations between the United States and Pakistan. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, according to the State Department, has raised the issue with Pakistani officials. And the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, Cameron Munter, has met with Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari on the issue. Members of Congress told senior Pakistani leaders that billions of dollars of U.S. aid are in jeopardy unless Davis is released. ""We indicated it could very well be"" that the United States might consider withholding funding, Rep. Howard ""Buck"" McKeon, R-California, said Tuesday after returning to Washington from meetings in Pakistan and Afghanistan. McKeon said he and two other congressmen on the trip had frank conversations with Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani and other senior officials about Davis. ""It is entirely possible that a member of Congress would come down and offer an amendment to cut funding for Pakistan, based on their detaining Mr. Davis, and my guess is there would be a lot support for such an amendment, frankly because of the outrage of detaining an American with diplomatic immunity,"" said Rep. John Klein, R-Minnesota. The U.S. spent more than $1.5 billion in non-military aid to Pakistan in fiscal year 2010. The case has sparked some protest and fueled anti-American feelings in Pakistan. During several protests last week, hard-line clerics condemned the shootings and demanded the government not release Davis to the U.S. government. Local television showed a rally in Karachi where protesters re-enacted their version of the shooting.  Men wearing smiling masks and holding toy guns played the part of Davis and gleefully danced around several protesters, who pretended to be the shooting victims. CNN's Jill Dougherty and Charley Keyes and Journalist Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","NEW: Davis' lawyer files petition for his immediate release .

"(CNN) -- A Massachusetts woman found guilty in the first-degree murder of her pregnant friend has been sentenced to life without the possibility of parole, according to Worcester Superior Court. Julie Corey, who was 35 at the time of the crime, was convicted in 2009. She was found to have bludgeoned and strangled her friend, Darlene Haynes, 23, before cutting the baby from the victim's womb. Haynes' body was found in her apartment on July 27, 2009. She was eight months pregnant at the time of her death. Days after the murder, Haynes' baby was found with Corey in New Hampshire. DNA evidence and a fingerprint on a bottle at the crime scene tied Corey to the killing, the district attorney's office said. According to trial testimony, Corey tried to pass the baby off as her own to family and friends, the statement said. ""It's probably the most horrific case this office has seen,"" said Worcester County District Attorney Joseph Early Jr. ""This woman was killed for her baby.""

"(CNN) -- Fifty years ago this weekend, a four-piece guitar band from Liverpool touched down at Kennedy airport in New York and changed the course of popular culture in the twentieth century. That much we can be sure of, and since the days of Beatlemania that guitar band has been credited with changing music, fashion, culture and everything else that really counted in the sixties. The trans-Atlantic entertainment industry is gearing up for an avalanche of tributes and events to commemorate this anniversary. The dyspeptic rock critic Lester Bangs once railed against the never-ending re-release of the Beatles catalog by asking: ""I'd like to know what I have missed by not missing the Beatles."" The answer over the next few weeks is plenty: concerts, exhibits, panel discussions, documentaries, conferences and a pre-recorded Grammy tribute featuring a ""reunion"" of Paul and Ringo. For that generation lucky enough to be swept along by Beatlemania, it was a unique event, a turning point for some. There are still plenty of Americans of a certain age who can tell you exactly what happened when they first saw the Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show that chilly February night: ""I was two inches from the screen, screaming."" The run-up to this anniversary feels a little like the preparations for the Beatles arrival in 1964, when there was a continual stream of tidbits, teasers and promotions which announced ""The Beatles are Coming!"" But instead of radio bulletins, high-school gossip, and those flyers that Capitol records distributed to record stores nationwide, this time the news comes to us on mobile phones and lap tops, in web casts and posts on the internet. If you miss the rebroadcast of the Ed Sullivan show this weekend you can easily retrieve it from numerous sites on the world wide web, but back in 1964 you had to wait a whole week for the next Ed Sullivan Show. This of course added to the tension and increased the expectation of another television event which could not be missed. If a note of self-congratulation enters into the celebrations, you can hardly blame the record and television companies for waxing nostalgic for a time when Americans were locked into watching three channels and still buying records. In the fractured and endlessly expanding digital world, nobody will be able to recreate the excitement of Beatlemania because it is no longer possible to completely command the media as the Beatles did back in 1964. The triumph of Beatlemania was essentially a triumph of the record -- the seven inch vinyl disc -- and a demonstration of its potency in diffusing culture and creating value. Beatlemania's anniversary might be the time to mark an end of that era, when records were something you treasured. In the digital world sound recordings are cheap and disposable; you won't be able to relive the giddy excitement of returning home with that priceless copy of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" with an MP3 download. The anniversary of Beatlemania will doubtless see more praise heaped on the musicians and their timeless music. But who were the architects of Beatlemania? Brian Epstein planned the campaign, perfected the look and made the deals (some strokes of genius, others not). Above all he saw the American market as the pinnacle of success: ""We knew that America would make us or break us as world stars...In fact, she made us."" How ironic that what began as an exercise in American exceptionalism ended in a ""British Invasion"" of imported music, fashion and design that swept all before it and made the sixties look and sound like the sixties. Beatlemania marked the ascendancy of British-based television producers who created a new type of music program -- live, frenetic, engaging -- and made the Beatles its most able practitioners. Beatlemania was powered by radio: not crystal-clear broadcasts from corporate headquarters but crackling, crummy AM, with crazed disc jockeys like Murray the K providing a running commentary of Beatlemania and whipping the fans into a frenzy. Those tiny transistor radios that the girls carried with them connected them to a larger community of Beatle lovers, a radio family who dressed alike, thought alike and shared the same obsession. Fifty years on that community sees Beatlemania as a special moment in time. There was an air of expectation in the crowd awaiting the Beatles at Kennedy: ""At the airport you could really feel that something was happening...you felt like this was the beginning of the earthquake."" And it was. The Beatles touched teenagers like no other band before or after, lifting their fans' gaze above the buying and selling of a commodity to an aura of hope and a state of transcendence. In 1964 music could change your life. The Beatles proved it. Read more: The Beatles of myth, the Beatles of reality . Read more: Did Beatles push black music aside? Read more: I was a Beatlemaniac .

"Maracaibo, Venezuela (CNN) -- It all started when Jose Augusto Montiel couldn't find any milk for his daily cafe con leche. The 21-year-old Venezuelan student didn't have a solution for widespread goods shortages in his country. But he had an idea, using lessons he'd learned about developing apps for smart phones. A month later, Abasteceme was born. The free mobile application's name is Spanish for ""supply me."" It allows users to enter data when they've spotted scarce goods on store shelves in the South American country. See the Abasteceme app . Opening the app shows a list of products. With the flick of a finger, maps show places to purchase cooking oil, sugar, flour, powdered milk and toilet paper, in addition to how much the items cost. ""For example, with oil it tells me that there isn't any within one kilometer, but we can increase it to 100, and then it shows me that yes, there is oil,"" Montiel explained, pointing at his phone. ""When I click, it tells me the price, the distance and the date, and if I click gain, I find the shortest route from my location."" Developing applications isn't a career path Montiel is planning to pursue. The university student plays violin in a symphony and is working on his chemical engineering thesis. He says he learned to develop apps when he was trying to find a way to buy a tablet computer. And now, he says, he's just trying to do his part. ""The only thing I did was add a grain of sand with what I have,"" he said. ""I think if we all put in a grain of sand and we give 100% of what we can give, we are going to have the country we want."" More than 14,000 people have downloaded the smart phone application so far. Its development comes as Venezuelans deal with widely reported goods shortages. Facing a toilet paper shortage last month, the country's government announced plans to import 50 million rolls to meet demand for the product. Toilet paper is just one of the basic goods and foodstuffs that have been disappearing from store shelves over the past few months, as the government and private companies blame each other for the scarcity. Businesses and the political opposition say government policies, including price controls on basic goods and tight restrictions on foreign currency, are to blame. Last month, Venezuelan Minister of Commerce Alejandro Fleming blamed the media for provoking fear in consumers, who in turn begin hoarding items. But Venezuelans say the shortages are very real. Even as she beams about her son's success and describes how he developed the application, Igia de Montiel Uribarri said there's only so much a smartphone can do. ""Right now, again I don't have any milk, and I said to him, 'Have you seen them say where there's milk?' He says, 'No, mommy, I haven't seen that.' That is to say, nothing has changed. This is not a cure. It only eases the situation,"" she says. ""It gives you some help."" Venezuela says it foiled plot to assassinate President Maduro . Venezuela frees, expels U.S. filmmaker .

"(CNN) -- It's February and Black History Month, and networks and major consumer brands are reprising their annual ad campaigns honoring the contributions of African-Americans to the arts, politics, technology and commerce. This year, a new player is sponsoring Black History Month ads: the Republican National Committee. In spots airing on black radio and television stations in select media markets, the RNC praises the contributions of black Republicans such as Louis Sullivan, a former secretary of health and human services under President George H.W. Bush. RNC makes first ad buy for Black History Month . This ad campaign is part of a larger Republican strategy to reach out to minority voters. After President Barack Obama won more than 70% of the vote among blacks, Latinos and Asian-Americans (93% among blacks alone) in 2012, the Republican National Committee redoubled its efforts to court minority voters. This ad campaign is a part of that effort. A well-produced, uplifting ad campaign will not be enough to convince black Democrats to switch their party identification, though. For every ad praising Sen. Tim Scott, the Republican Party has had to put out fires created by state and local officials who make insensitive racial comments. For instance, in the past two weeks, the Iowa Republican Party had to fire the mastermind behind the ""Is Someone a Racist?"" flow chart on its Facebook page. The flow chart flippantly charged that racists are white people you don't like. RNC highlights strategy for building 'new generation of black Republicans' By this point, some Republicans are probably wondering why blacks don't seem to punish liberals and Democrats for their racial missteps. Democrat-friendly MSNBC has faced strong and valid criticism for its recent taunts of the Romney family's transracial adoption and its assumptions that conservative Republicans don't marry interracially. For his part, Fox host Bill O'Reilly raised eyebrows when he asked Obama why he had not done more to lower the out-of-wedlock birth rate among blacks. The answer is rooted in a long, complicated history of race and partisanship and in psychological frames that the GOP ignores at its peril. RNC clarifies tweet that suggests racism is over . Some Republicans rightfully point out that during the civil rights movement, Southern Democrats tried to block passage of the Civil and Voting Rights Acts. They forget, however, that in the past 50 years, white Southern Democrats (both racists and non-racists) have gradually shifted their party identification to the Republican Party. They don't account for the fact that GOP has admitted to (and apologized for) purposely using racially coded language to win over racially resentful whites in the wake of the civil rights movement. And they ignore data that confirm that while black political views have moderated in the past generation, blacks still tend to prefer a stronger federal state and greater governmental intervention, in large part because they perceive the federal government to have done a better job than state and local officials at protecting civil rights. The 'white' student who integrated Ole Miss . Perhaps the biggest impediment to the GOP's outreach efforts among blacks, though, is its misunderstanding of the importance of group dynamics to individual political decision-making. Republicans value limited government and personal liberty, traits that celebrate rugged individualism and a view of politics that assumes that self-interest informs most policy preferences. Numerous studies have shown that many blacks and Latinos believe that what happens to other blacks and Latinos affects them. This belief that their fates are linked to the fates of their co-ethnics informs liberal policy and political preferences. It means that an affluent black person might be willing to pay higher taxes if it helps maintain the food stamp program, which helps poor, disproportionately minority people. Or that a Latina born in the United States might wince when Republican congressional candidates voice their opposition to immigration reform because she perceives that tone of the opposition evinces a general antipathy toward Latinos regardless of their nativity. Don't get me wrong, Republican outreach to blacks is a good thing, and I hope to see more of it. Republican candidates who win office need to engage their black and minority constituents, and Democrats should not assume that blacks (or any other group) will always vote Democratic. However, a polished ad campaign alone is not enough to win over black voters. If the GOP hopes to become significantly more competitive among blacks, it will have to acknowledge the importance of group identity to blacks and other minorities and learn how to frame their principles in terms of group interests. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andra Gillespie.","Republican National Committee ad campaign celebrates Black History Month .

"New York (CNN) -- Cellphone video captured by two New York-bound Delta Air Lines passengers Saturday night portrays the fear of an impending crash and the relief that followed when the pilot averted a catastrophic landing. ""Brace for impact,"" a deep voice says on the intercom. ""Heads down! Stay down! Heads down! Stay down!"" a woman commands for more than 30 seconds. Two passengers aboard Flight 4951 from Atlanta, Georgia, to White Plains, New York, taped the dramatic moments of their flight's emergency landing at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. The passengers who shot the footage, Chase Benzenberg and Alessandro Albero, said Monday on CNN's ""American Morning"" that what first seemed amusing soon turned into a serious situation. ""While we were circling Westchester Airport, we circled for a good 20 minutes and we were joking around with each other, saying, 'I don't know if he knows where the landing strip is,' and then they made the announcement on the loudspeaker,"" Albero said. ""Alessandro was concerned that he was right next to the wing and he got to see the whole thing. So we didn't know if there was going to be sparks flying through the window, an engine flying through,"" said Benzenberg. The footage from Flight 4951 shows sparks outside a window of the plane's cabin. The flight experienced landing gear problems, according to a recording of a pilot's conversation with air traffic control. ""We have 64 souls on board,"" the pilot said, according to LiveATC.net, which provides audio from air traffic control radio communications. ""We've been running all the checklists and talking to our maintenance and approach, our maintenance and dispatcher and we have not been able to get the landing gear down,"" the pilot said. ""Our preference would be to proceed over to JFK and execute an emergency landing over there ... and if it's not completely obvious, we just want to confirm, we are declaring an emergency."" After the pilot told passengers about the issues with the landing gear, ""We're envisioning belly slide the whole way, with sparks,"" Benzenberg said. ""But they actually came out later and said that there were -- it's only the right rear landing gear that would not come down, so it would be hitting the wing, which is actually what happened."" Benzenberg said the announcement upset some of the passengers. ""I saw the lady sitting in front of me who just had tears coming down and she was holding her husband's hand,"" he said. ""Another lady was reaching for a life jacket, saying, 'I can't get it. It's stuck.' I said 'We don't need that right now. We're not going into water. Just listen to the instructions and try to stay calm.'"" The pilot and an air traffic controller arranged for the plane to land at JFK. ""Emergency equipment standing by midfield as a precautionary measure,"" the air traffic controller said. The plane landed safely with no injuries reported. ""Landing was actually quite smooth. The pilot did a wonderful job,"" Albero said. ""We came down and the plane tipped slightly and the sparks came up ... It was pretty intense, but they did a wonderful job."" Albero said the landing was ""an incredible moment,"" with everybody clapping, then hugging and shaking hands after an immediate evacuation. In retrospect, the men say the situation was not as dire as their video made it seem. ""[The flight attendant heard on the tape] actually made it more intense than I think it really was. But that's what's the right thing to do in that situation,"" said Benzenberg. He added, ""Initially, we would say that we survived a plane crash, but it's kind of -- after it was all finished, I almost hoped it was a little bit more bumpier or something just so we had a cooler story, but we're just happy to be safe."" Albero's girlfriend may have been among those most concerned. Albero drained his phone's battery taping the incident, so after telling his girlfriend the plane was making an emergency landing, he was unable to call her back. He eventually contacted her on Benzenberg's cellphone. The Federal Aviation Administration has not released a cause for why the plane's landing gear malfunctioned. CNN's Rick Martin, Ric Ward and Miguel Susana and contributed to this report.","A flight from Atlanta to White Plains, New York, experiences a landing gear problem .

"London (CNN) -- Tensions between Turkey and Israel worsened Thursday when Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country would follow aid ships to Gaza trying to break the Israeli blockade. It comes as Israeli officials said Turkey had expelled three diplomats from the Turkish capital of Ankara. Relations between the two countries have deteriorated since a raid on a Turkish ship carrying aid to Gaza last year when Israeli commandos killed eight Turks and one Turkish American. A United Nations investigation into the incident found that the Israeli blockade of Gaza is a ""legitimate security measure"" in compliance with international law, but it said that Israel had used ""excessive and unreasonable"" force. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the recent increase in tensions between the two countries ""was not our choice"" but added that Israel had the right to defend its coast and to prevent smugglers and flotillas reaching the Gaza Strip. CNN asked Fadi Hakura, Associate Fellow and Manager of the Turkey Project at Chatham House in London -- a British institute for the independent analysis of international issues -- for his take on Turkey's relationship with Israel. What led to the souring of relations between Turkey and Israel? ""Turkey was the first Muslim-majority country to establish diplomatic relations with Israel in March 1949. Since then, bilateral relations reflected the regional conditions in the Middle East. As the Middle East peace process blossomed in the 1990s, both countries enjoyed close political, economic and military ties. ""However, bilateral relations deteriorated after Israel's military operations in Gaza. They took a turn for the worse when Israeli naval commandos intercepted the Turkish ship Mavi Marmara en route to breach the Israeli blockade of Gaza. That incident led to the deaths of eight Turks and one Turkish-American. ""Israel refused Turkey's demand for an apology but agreed to express regret and pay compensation for the Mavi Marmara victims."" How serious is the pledge to escort aid ships? ""The Turkish prime minister has threatened to send naval warships to escort future civilian aid ships heading to Gaza. So far, Turkey seems to be sabre-rattling. But the risk of a naval confrontation between Israel and Turkey in the future cannot be totally discounted."" How does this affect relations between the two countries? ""Turkey's downgrading of diplomatic relations with Israel signals a major escalation of Turkish-Israeli tensions with Israel. Thus far, Israel's response to the Turkish sanctions has been muted but may react if Turkey raises the stakes further."" Who has the most to lose? ""Turkey's suspension of military ties with Israel will not have an immediate impact since there are no major outstanding defence contracts or joint military exercises between both countries. ""A more immediate impact is the loss of intelligence-sharing between Israel and Turkey, but it is likely the U.S. will try to minimize the implications on intelligence cooperation. ""Israel does not wish to lose access to Turkey's $ 700 billion economy, one of the largest in the Middle East. ""Similarly, Turkey is not keen for the time being to diminish business opportunities and the web of private sector interests with Israel at a time of challenging economic conditions. ""For example, the northwestern province of Bursa has started manufacturing the Fluence Z.E., an electric car from Renault and Nissan, thanks to a deal signed with the Israeli company Better Place. ""However, the escalation of tensions may eventually undermine bilateral trade beyond the loss of Israeli tourism to Turkey and defence deals between both countries."" Is Erdogan playing to a home audience and if so why? ""Prime Minister Erdogan is keen to portray Turkey as a leader in the Middle East and the Muslim world. His self-confidence has grown immeasurably since winning a decisive victory in the general elections of June 2011. Part of his popularity stems from an assertive and confrontational attitude towards Israel."" What are the regional implications? ""Turkey's tensions with Israel come at time of uprisings in Egypt, Libya and Syria. In the short term, Prime Minister Erdogan's popularity among Arabs and Muslims may experience a temporary surge. ""Longer term, if the U.S. is successful in managing the fallout in Israeli-Turkish relations, then regional implications will be contained."" Has the 'Arab Spring' had a bearing on this relationship? ""The Turkey-Israel relations predated the so-called Arab Spring. They were on a downward spiral since the Israeli military intervention in Gaza."" What about Turkey's relationship with the European Union -- does this affect its desire to join the EU? ""Turkey's confrontation with Israel has no bearing on its already fractious and challenging relationship with the EU. German and French opposition to Turkish aspirations to join the EU has brought the process to a standstill. Turkey's chances of membership looked slim prior to the recent escalation of tensions with Israel.""","UN report found Israeli blockade of Gaza ""legitimate"" but was critical of  ""excessive force""

"(CNN) -- At least 12 people were killed in violent clashes between Yemeni troops and militants secessionists in the southern Yemeni province of Dhaleh on Tuesday, two Defense Ministry officials told CNN. Among those killed were six troops and six militants. A top army colonel was among the government troops killed. The Defense Ministry issued a statement in which it said that 14 soldiers were kidnapped by the secessionists. The ministry described the incident as a sabotage attack against a military supply truck. Residents told CNN that artillery shelling started in the morning hours and continued until the evening. ""Bullets have entered through our home windows,"" said Saber Jamal, a resident in Dhaleh province. A ministry official said that clashes with the militants took place in four different fronts in the province. In January, the military shelled a funeral tent, allegedly by mistake, killing more than a dozen separatist supporters in Dhaleh. Clashes in the province have taken place on numerous occasions since, killing more than 30 over the past month. Earlier this month, the international community hailed Yemen's successes in the National Dialogue Conference, which aims to mainly solve the worries of southerners. The dialogue was launched one month after President Abdurabu Hadi came to power in 2012. Hadi took office as part of a internationally supported political deal that led to the ouster of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who departed a year after mass protests broke out. But secessionists say NDC resolutions have failed to address the southern issue in a manner conducive to trust. Political experts say that implementation of dialogue resolutions would need patience from all political sides. ""Security is tense and factions who stand against reforms in Yemen will attempt to spread chaos and destabilize the country, said Nabil al-Khamery, a senior Yemeni politician, told CNN. ""Political factions need to support the government and the transitional president Abdurabu Hadi as Yemen passes through this critical time,"" he added .","Ministry official: Clashes happened in four places in southern province of Dhaleh .

"Bab al-Salam, Syria (CNN) -- It is a sight almost as surreal as it is disturbing: three boys, on the cusp of being teenagers, digging furiously with their hands and sticks. It is in some ways playtime, but there is little innocence left in this refugee camp sandwiched between Syria's north and an unwelcoming Turkish border. Muhammad Zafir says their frantic excavations are in case ""jets come and drop bombs,"" he said. ""We put children here to hide them, but of course we will make it much bigger for 20 to 30."" It is a testament to their fast and unnatural path into manhood: Hours that should be spent idling or playing football are lost to digging an air raid shelter. Muhammad can explain the different noises made by jet missiles, rocket-propelled grenades and heavy machine guns. The three boys are also digging peepholes into their structure, so they could see outside during any attack. It's rudimentary and made entirely of mud and finger marks, but it is all they have. This is life for the 8,000 Syrians who fled everything, hoping for something but ending up with little. Despite being some 100 yards from a NATO power -- the doorstep of Europe -- and a developed economy, they scavenge for wood and burn plastic to keep warm. They chop down weeds to supplement their faltering diet. Some 22 months into the war -- and despite the world's sympathy -- they face a winter of freezing temperatures and uncertain food. Refugees in the Bab al-Salam camp just inside Syria can see the Turkish refugee camps from the roofs of their buildings, but Turkey for now will not accept them. So they are caught between the war they fled and the outside world that will not embrace them. They number some 200 families and growing, huddled around plastic tents that work as temporary shelter during summer but will do little to protect them from the frost of winter. Husan Shammo used to work in the nearby town of Azaz for the Red Crescent and is now the closest thing this sprawling camp has to an organizer. He explains why so many ended up shut out by Turkey. ""Of course 80% of those here came hoping to cross into Turkey,"" he said, ""but the Turkish government stopped hosting over six weeks ago. People are furious, and we can't provide a lot of their daily needs."" Here, within earshot of Turkey's highways, you can also hear the distant but occasional thud of artillery -- a reminder that the war they fled remains the worse option over the squalor they now endure. Winter, however, will be their greatest enemy in the months ahead. Dozens of families have taken advantage of the concrete truck shelters at this border crossing, moving their tents into the hangar-like structures, hoping the roofs will provide a little more shelter. But for Abdul Qadr al-Hasan's daughter Siham, the cold came too fast. Holding his surviving daughter, the thick-set man describes how Siham died. ""She was not sick. She didn't have any problems at all. We were up late that night and we were playing with her,"" he said. ""We woke up the next morning ... She was curled into a ball from the cold. We buried her in the village. Her sister is afraid now of the cold."" Had his family had a stove in their tent just a few weeks earlier, Siham would have lived. But the struggle to keep warm brings its own hazards. Wood is scarce. Easier to find is plastic, which burns with a sickly, acrid smoke. Children scour the fields for this ""treasure"" but then reap the consequences from the heat: a poisonous blanket of smoke that brings hacking coughs to each settlement. At the sun sets, children find a patch of herbs -- weeds almost -- growing naturally against a wall and cut them down for food. Despite being so close to a developed economy, they are reeling with the war raging next door. But now it is the best the world has to offer for these 8,000 Syrians.

"(CNN) -- Charges were dismissed against one of two former teachers accused of lewd conduct in a high-profile student abuse case in a Los Angeles school because an alleged victim won't testify, authorities said Wednesday. Martin Bernard Springer, 51, had been facing three felony counts of a lewd act on a girl under age 14 and three misdemeanor counts of child molesting against a girl under age 18. The incidents allegedly occurred against one victim at Miramonte Elementary School between April 2009 and June 2009. Those six charges were dismissed Wednesday by Los Angeles County Judge Charlaine Olmedo, officials said. ""The prosecution announced today that we are unable to proceed because the victim does not want to testify,"" Shiara Davila-Morales, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney, said Wednesday. ""The victim, who is now 12, was very traumatized with the experience of testifying in court during the preliminary hearing. Because her testimony is essential to the case, the DA's Office cannot proceed without her testimony. The case can be refiled, however, should the victim change her mind within the statute of limitations,"" Davila-Morales said. The alleged abuse of students at Miramonte Elementary drew widespread attention because another former teacher, Mark Berndt, was arrested and accused of taking bondage photos of more than two dozen students in his classroom, including some with suspected semen-filled spoons at their mouths. Berndt pleaded no contest to felony lewd acts on 23 children and was recently sentenced to 25 years in prison. His case led to almost 200 students suing Los Angeles Unified School District, claiming that they, too, were victims, and the district reached a $30 million settlement with 63 of 190 students' claims alleging they were victims of sexually lewd acts by Berndt. The remaining claims are pending.","Three felonies and three misdemeanors are dismissed against Martin Bernard Springer .

"(CNN) -- You could have gotten very good odds had you predicted at the beginning of 2013, when John Kerry took office as secretary of state, that he would end up having the most successful year of anyone in the Obama administration or, indeed, Washington. Kerry was an old familiar face, a man whose moment had come and gone with his presidential candidacy in 2004. He was following in the footsteps of the most popular politician in America in an administration not famous for giving its Cabinet members much of the limelight that was jealously guarded for the President. He also was going to be thrust into an international situation in which the problems ranged from intractable to almost incomprehensible at a time when the people of the United States had precious little interest in overseas engagement. Yet here we are a year later and Kerry is widely regarded as having transcended himself, his job, the limitations placed on him by the White House, and the challenges of the world scene. He is viewed as a man who has effectively built on the work Hilary Clinton did to restore diplomacy to the center of U.S. foreign policy and, in fact, as a greater risk taker than she was. He has shown creativity, tenacity, the courage to stand up to leaders overseas and his would-be minders in the administration and has won widespread kudos for it. One very senior Middle East diplomat on Tuesday described him to me as a ""national treasure"" for the United States. And this is someone who has many issues with the United States' handling of crises in Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Iran. Another leader from the same region described the Kerry Israel-Palestine peace process as the ""most remarkable effort I have seen in my lifetime."" Within the State Department, while he is not given top grades as a manager of that big bureaucracy, he is seen as a force of nature, as someone who is willing the department into the central role that for the past decade was primarily occupied by the Pentagon in shaping U.S. international priorities. Some of the change in the role of diplomacy is, of course, a result of shifting away from a war footing in Iraq and Afghanistan, withdrawing our troops and thus making military action less central to our initiatives in the Middle East. But that could just as easily have created a void. Yet Kerry stepped in and from the beginning astonished everyone with his appetite to tackle the Israel-Palestine issue, his nimbleness in turning missteps in Syria into a chemical deal that would have been hard to imagine months earlier and his stewardship of the administration's Iran nuclear negotiations. Some characterized him as a dreamer early on, a Don Quixote. But with the progress that has already been achieved on all three fronts, it is impossible not to see him as making a significant impactâ€”largely by virtue of his tireless travel schedule, his mastery of the facts and his force of personality. Of course, it is just a year that has transpired. While expectations for the Kerry tenure at State may have started low, he has raised them considerably. Now all eyes are on these three deals to see what happens. Will there be an Iran deal? If so, will it be a good one that the Congress and our allies can accept or will it strengthen Iran without gaining real peace of mind for the United States and our allies in the region? Will the Syria chemical deal, which the United States has complained is not resulting in the elimination of weapons fast enough, ultimately deliver on its original goals? Or will it continue to serve, as President Obama's own top intelligence official recently asserted, to strengthen the regime of Bashar al-Assad? Opinion: Are Syria, Iran playing Obama for a fool? And what benefit will a chemical weapons deal achieve if Syria continues to fester and serve as both a killing field and a training ground for an unprecedented number of extremists? Can progress be made between Israel and the Palestinians? Even with the sniping that Kerry is receiving from top officials in the Israeli government? Even with the divisions among the Palestinians? And what of the decay in Iraq? The possibility that the same will occur in Afghanistan when the United States leaves or that in leaving there, we will also become less capable of fighting terrorism in Pakistan? What of the shape-shifting and spread of al Qaeda and similar extremist groups? And what of the rest of the world that feels that the United States is once again focused almost exclusively on the Middle East even as large emerging markets are buffeted by crisis, Africa is rocked by wars, and our alliances are in desperate need of modernization? No, while Kerry has had a remarkable year and has been an invaluable asset for the United States, he and his team know well that their toughest work lies ahead. His legacy and that of the President he serves will be determined less by the considerable progress of the past year and much more by whether the opportunities he has helped create can be capitalized upon in the time between now and the end of 2016. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Rothkopf.","David Rothkopf: Many doubted John Kerry would succeed against tough odds .

"(CNN) -- ""The Walking Dead"" left us hanging with its midseason finale last year, so we knew to expect surprises when the AMC show returned Sunday. And oh, were there surprises. We talked with Danai Gurira -- aka Michonne -- ahead of Sunday's premiere, and she said to watch for a different tone during the remainder of season four as the focus shifted to the journey of individual characters. She conveniently left out that her character's backstory would be explored in a dream sequence, a scene that easily became one of Sunday's highlights. There was much-needed insight into Michonne, including an apparent explanation on why she became so emotional when holding baby Judith -- she had had a son before (not to mention a lover). Here are three other moments that still have us talking: . 1. Rick's not dead, is he? Rick was left in a horrid state after a prison attack in the midseason finale, and at first it seemed that he was going to be the first casualty of ""The Walking Dead's"" return. Our panic grew after a struggling Carl thought his father was a goner when he couldn't wake him up. During the seconds it took for Carl to draw and aim his gun, we wondered the same thing he'd been wondering: Could he survive without his dad? Thankfully, he didn't have to answer that question. 2. Michonne's walker ""pets"" and a disturbing discovery . In addition to her backstory filling in some of the blanks, Michonne revived something else from the past Sunday: her ""pets."" As she left the prison, she crafted another set of armless, jawless walkers to accompany her through the desolation -- but not before stumbling upon the decapitated head of Hershel. But Michonne's a soldier: She pushed past the horror of finding Hershel's zombie noggin and had the courage to end his life. Her strength was on display again when she sprang back to life in a herd of walkers, slaying them with her weapon of choice, a katana. 3. Carl becomes a man . Rick, Carl and Michonne were the only three from the original clan in Sunday's episode, which offered an especially intimate view of Carl's struggle. He was angry with his father, Rick, for the desperate state they're now in, so much so he believes he can make it on his own and wouldn't care if his dad were dead. (That's obviously not so true, given his hesitation to shoot him.) Carl did test out his solo survival skills, and although he nearly was turned into a walker, the experience left him unscathed and with a renewed perspective.

"(CNN) -- Barcelona may not be the force it once was -- but it still had too much for Manchester City. City, which has now exited both the FA Cup and Champions League in the past week, was always going to find life difficult after losing the first leg of its Champions League last-16 tie. Trailing by two goals and with the knowledge that no club has ever managed to progress after suffering a 2-0 defeat at home in the first leg of the competition, City at least gave it a real go in a pulsating contest at the Camp Nou. In the end, despite plenty of courage and endeavor, goals from Lionel Messi and Dani Alves decided this tie as Barcelona gained a 2-1 win to progress 4-1 on aggregate. Vincent Kompany had briefly leveled the game with a minute of normal time remaining before Alves struck -- and City finished the game with 10-men after Pablo Zabaleta was sent off. ""We've got nothing left in the tank, we gave everything,"" Kompany told Sky Sports. ""We could have scored earlier which would have changed the game. ""You have to take your half chances against the best teams. Over the course of the two games there was not much between the sides. Lionel Messi is incredible player but outside of that it was even. ""Only the winners get remembered but it's only our third season in the Champions League. ""The way we have played means we should fear nobody next season and our time will come."" Much had been made of Barcelona's supposed fragility under Tata Martino and its recent defeats by Real Sociedad and Real Valladolid. Martino, who replaced Tito Vilanova at the start of the season, has come under increasing pressure with his team four points off league leader Real Madrid. But here, his team had too much for City, even if some doubts remain about its ability to challenge the likes of Bayern Munich and Real for the trophy. It was City which started the better of the two but the visitor soon began to ride its luck as Barcelona grew frustrated at the decisions of the officials. With manager Manuel Pellegrini sat in the stands after being handed a touchline ban following his disparaging remarks about Swedish referee Jonas Eriksson, who presided over the first leg, City was left in the hands of assistant Ruben Cousillas. Not that there was much Cousillas could do as Barcelona began to turn the screw. First, the home side felt it should have been awarded a penalty when Messi went down under the challenge of Joleon Lescott but referee Stephane Lannoy waved away the appeals. If that decision was marginal, what followed was hugely fortunate as the assistant referee deprived Barcelona of what would have been a perfectly legitimate goal. Messi found Xavi and when the midfield maestro slipped in Jordi Alba, the full-back crossed for Neymar to tap the ball into the empty net. Unfortunately for Barcelona, the offside flag had been raised, despite Alba clearly being in an onside position. Having survived the early scare, City slowly found their feet and should have taken the lead four minutes before the interval. Yaya Toure, formerly of Barcelona, picked out David Silva and when the Spaniard's sublime flick found Samir Nasri, the City midfielder could only shoot straight at Victor Valdes. The second half provided more enthralling action with Messi coming within inches of breaking the deadlock after jinking his way into the penalty area before smashing an effort against the post. At the other end, Edin Dzeko, on as a halftime substitute for the injured Sergio Aguero, sent a looping header towards goal which was brilliantly clawed away by Valdes with the ball seemingly destined for the corner. Pablo Zabaleta then fired wide as City threatened to plunder the goal that their play had deserved. As City pushed forward in search of that elusive opener, Barcelona began to make the most of the space left behind. And it came as little surprise when Messi finally broke through, clipping the ball past Joe Hart to score his 67th Champions League goal. There was still more drama to come with a little over 12 minutes remaining when Dzeko appeared to be blatantly fouled inside the penalty area by Gerard Pique -- but referee Lannoy disagreed. Such was City's anger that Zabaleta was shown a second yellow card and promptly dismissed for voicing his frustration. City did net an equalizer through Kompany with a minute of normal time remaining to salvage some pride. But Barcelona refused to be denied and Dan Alves netted a late winner, firing home from Andres Iniesta's pass to secure victory. ""It was a very tight game against a world class team,"" Barcelona's Cesc Fabregas told Sky Sports. ""It was a great result to win 2-0 over there and today it was tough. ""We created a lot of chances, we had a goal which was onside ruled out and could have had a penalty. ""We go home happy. The last couple of games have not made us happy, we had some negative results but we have to be proud of today's result. ""Everything is good at the club. We are in the final of the cup, we are four points behind in the league and in the last eight of the Champions League. A lot of teams would swap."" Messi, who scored his 28th goal of the season, believes this result proves Barcelona is on the way back to finding its best form. Barca, which sits third in La Liga, faces Osasuna this weekend before traveling to Madrid for 'El Clasico' on March 23. ""I think tonight we got back to being the Barcelona that we all want to see and we were able to beat a very tough opponent,"" he told Canal Plus. ""I don't know if the criticism (in the media after the La Liga defeat to Valladolid) was over the top. We are the first to criticize ourselves and we didn't play the way we should have done there. ""We don't let the criticism affect us and we just focus on ourselves and try to turn things around and that's what we did tonight, I think."" In the night's other game, Paris Saint-Germain secured its place in the last eight with a 2-1 win over Bayer Leverkusen to secure a 6-1 aggregate victory. After Sidney Sam had given the German side a surprise lead, PSG hit back through Marquinhos, who headed home from close range. Simon Rolfes than missed a penalty for Leverkusen before Ezequiel Lavezzi sealed the win for the French champion. Leverkusen ended the contest with 10-men after Emre Can was shown a second yellow card for diving.","Barcelona books its place in the quarterfinals of Champions League .

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- A once-celebrated Japanese composer who last week confessed his works were written by a ghostwriter, and subsequently had doubt cast on his claim to be deaf, now admits at least partially faking his hearing loss. Mamoru Samuragochi, until recently hailed as a ""Japanese Beethoven"" for composing hit symphonies despite claiming to have been completely deaf for 15 years, made the admission in a handwritten apology sent to news organizations through his lawyers. ""I apologize from the bottom of my heart for betraying and hurting many people,"" he wrote, in his first public statement addressing the allegations about his hearing. In a televised press conference last week, a Tokyo music teacher named Takashi Niigaki revealed that he had secretly been the real composer of Samuragochi's works for 18 years. He also expressed doubt over the composer's claims of deafness -- central to his romantic public image as a genius who ""felt"" music he could not hear -- saying that Samuragochi had conversed with him normally, and provided critiques on the music he contracted him to write over the years. ""I've never felt he was deaf ever since we met,"" he said. READ MORE: Uproar as 'Japanese Beethoven' exposed as fraud . In his written statement, Samuragochi, who is yet to publicly front over the scandal, said that he had been deaf, but in the past three years had recovered a degree of hearing. ""It has recovered to an extent where I could sometimes grasp words when someone speaks clearly and slowly close to my ears, though it sounds muffled and skewed,"" he wrote. Stating that he planned to apologize to the public in person soon, Samuragochi added that he was prepared to have his hearing medically tested, and would forfeit his government-issued disability certificate if found ineligible. The eight-page letter also contained apologies to tsunami victims, for whom his most famous symphony had become an important symbol of resilience, and to Japanese Olympic figure skater Daisuke Takahashi, who planned to perform to another ghostwritten work in Sochi. Takahashi takes to the ice Thursday, and the Japanese Skating Federation has said that while the score will be used, the composer's name will be omitted from the program. ""I am deeply ashamed of living a life of lies,"" said Samuragochi's statement. Samuragochi claimed to rely on his perfect pitch to compose his hit symphonies, movie scores and video game soundtracks after losing his hearing, telling TIME magazine in a 2001 interview that ""if you trust your inner sense of sound, you create something that is truer... Losing my hearing was a gift from God."" When confessing that a ghostwriter had been involved in composing his most famous works, he claimed that he had provided the broader ideas for the music, while the collaborator had produced the finished scores. But Niigaki said he did not believe Samuragochi was even capable of writing musical scores, and had threatened to kill himself if their arrangement was exposed.","Disgraced ""deaf composer"" Mamoru Samuragochi has admitted he has some hearing .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Washington is sending a veteran politician, not a career diplomat, as its new ambassador to China. Six-term Democratic Party Senator Max Baucus, 72, will soon take up his diplomatic post in Beijing, replacing Gary Locke, who is stepping down to rejoin his family in Seattle. Given his relative lack of China experience, some, in both the U.S. and in China are wondering if Baucus is a good choice. He has made eight trips to China and has met with to Chinese leaders, but he is not considered a China hand. His strong suit is his extensive experience when it comes to trade issues. In his new role, he is expected to press China to play by internationally accepted rules regarding currency, intellectual property, labor and human rights and free trade. His past trade successes involving China have also been noted. ""In the 1990s, he played a pivotal role in China's accession to the World Trade Organization and normalizing trade ties between our countries,"" said Xie Tao, a professor at Beijing University of Languages and Culture. ""To appoint a free trade supporter and a veteran senator can be viewed as a positive move from the US administration to encourage more trade."" Knowledge = power? Over the past 25 years covering China, I have seen several U.S. ambassadors come and go. They came with different personal and career backgrounds, politics and agenda. Curiously, the envoy's knowledge of China did not always equate to impact on policy-making. China-born and Mandarin-speaking James Lilley (1989-1991) and Stapleton Roy (1991-1995) displayed deep knowledge of Chinese history and culture, but because they were political outsiders in Washington, their advice often went unheeded. In contrast, retired senator Jim Sasser (1996-1999) knew little about China before his posting, but because he was a political insider, ""he could walk into the White House or Capitol Hill, meet with the president or with influential senators, and lobby,"" recalled a political analyst in Beijing. 'Low key' Locke . Locke, 63, was the first American of Chinese descent to head the embassy in Beijing. Under his two-and-a-half year watch, the embassy was embroiled in dramatic diplomatic rows but his common touch made him popular among ordinary Chinese. In February 2012, a former police chief in Chongqing sought refuge in the U.S. consulate in Chengdu, which ultimately led to the downfall of top politician Bo Xilai. Two months later, Chen Guangcheng, a blind activist, escaped from house arrest to seek refuge in the Beijing embassy. Locke helped broker a deal that allowed Chen to travel to New York to study. Chinese netizens admired him for his low-key and frugal style. He will perhaps be best remembered for photographs taken before he landed in Beijing, which showed him carrying his backpack and using vouchers to buy coffee at a Starbucks at the Seattle airport. These pictures went viral in China's social media. Reports of him flying economy class and turning down five-star hotel accommodation during business trips buttressed his unassuming public image. Some local commentators taunted Locke for resorting to ""publicity stunts"", but these vignettes went down well with a Chinese public turned off by tales of corruption, extravagance and arrogance among their own officials. ""The Chinese loved Locke because he fulfilled the many dreams of Chinese who still saw the U.S. as a land of opportunity,"" said a former diplomat who worked for Locke. ""They also feared him because his down-to-earth style and common touch reminded Chinese people what many of their own government leaders were not."" Many Chinese credit Locke for cutting the waiting time for U.S. visas to three to five days from 70 to 100 days when he took over. The improvement significantly increased Chinese business and travel tourism to the U.S. ""His primary target was making the potential of Chinese economic growth benefit the American people,"" the diplomat added. Baucus' to-do list . Difficulties lie ahead for Baucus as the two big powers wrestle a slew of thorny problems, including strategic mistrust, the volatile territorial issues pitting China against U.S. allies Japan and the Philippines, the Taiwan issue, and differences over trade and human rights. And Baucus will be hard-pressed to keep Obama and U.S. policy makers focused on China as they are distracted by myriad domestic and global issues. ""He will have to keep DC's interest piqued to keep the U.S.-China relationship as one of the more important bilateral relationships out there,"" said the former U.S. diplomat. ""He is going to have to use his relationships on the Capitol Hill and among the DC elite to keep China issues at the forefront."" Shen Dingli, executive dean of the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, thinks Locke's weaknesses are Baucus' strengths. ""Baucus was a colleague of Obama, Biden and McCain, a friend of Clinton. Forty years in DC, so he knows everyone,"" said Shen. ""Locke was an outsider in Washington DC and that was his inherent disadvantage."" What lessons can Baucus draw from his predecessor? Outgoing Locke suggests that Baucus travel extensively, especially to small villages in remote areas. ""My sincere advice to him is to visit various places in China -- as many as he can -- and understand local customs and practices,"" Locke said in a magazine interview on the eve of his departure. ""Beijing is not China and big cities can't be representative of China."" During his relatively short tenure, Locke has traveled to Chongqing, Guangdong, Sichuan, Tibet and Xinjiang, where he talked with local officials and residents. Fudan University's Shen says the new ambassador should act as a bridge between the two countries. ""While preaching American values, don't alienate yourself from the Chinese government and people,"" he said. It seems that the Chinese people are already talking about him. He's been a hot topic of conversation on social media in the country since his appointment, with some having fun suggesting how to transliterate his name in Chinese. One suggests Bao Ke Si, which literally means ""assured to cough to death"", a tangential criticism of Beijing's polluted air. Some local netizens wonder whether the 72-year-old incoming envoy could bear Beijing's pernicious heavy smog. For his part, Baucus, a keen distance runner during his time inside the Beltway, may already have a head-start in ingratiating himself with Beijingers. He said shortly after his confirmation that he has his ""eye on the Beijing marathon,"" although he may want to wait and see what smog levels are like closer to the date.","Washington has chosen veteran politician with little diplomatic experience .

"(CNN) -- Iran will not dismantle any of its nuclear facilities as part of an effort to reach a long-term agreement to limit its nuclear development, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in an interview published Friday in The Financial Times. Asked during the interview if dismantling Iran's nuclear facilities was a ""red line,"" Rouhani said: ""100 percent."" Rouhani's statements are unlikely to sit well with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has said any long-term agreement with Iran over its nuclear development must lead to the dismantling of the country's nuclear capability. Iran and the so-called P5+1 -- the United States, Britain, China, Russia, France and Germany -- agreed Sunday to a six-month deal to limit Tehran's nuclear development. Even though it's only a short-term agreement, world leaders hope it'll pave the way to a long-term guarantee that Iran won't produce nuclear weapons. And Iran hopes to recoup some of the billions of dollars it's lost as a result of international sanctions. World powers will suspend sanctions on various items, including gold and petrochemical exports. That suspension will provide Iran with about $1.5 billion in revenue, according to the White House. Netanyahu has criticized the agreement, calling it a ""historic mistake."" Now that sanctions are working, Netanyahu wants to see them tightened, not loosened, until Iran shuts down much of its nuclear capability. Israel and the West have accused Iran of secretly working to develop a nuclear weapons program, an allegation that Tehran has vehemently denied. ""The nuclear activities of the Islamic Republic of Iran as has been repeatedly said will be purely for peaceful purposes,"" Rouhani said. But he also told the newspaper how much uranium is enriched by Iran will ""depend on our needs for nuclear fuel."" Rouhani gave the interview as he marked his 100th day as Iran's leader. Rouhani, whose tone is far less fiery than that of his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, promised during his election campaign that he would work toward positive engagement with the West. His charm offensive, as it has been described, has raised questions among many about whether Rouhani is serious in easing tensions with the West. Rouhani told the newspaper that the agreement hammered out in Geneva is an important first step to see if a mutual trust can be built with the United States. ""The problems created over 35 years cannot be resolved over a limited time. The best test to see whether we are capable of building trust or not is this nuclear issue,"" he said. ""If the first steps taken in Geneva are implemented carefully and precisely, it would mean that we have taken one step forward towards trust."" He also said a recent telephone call with British Prime Minister David Cameron left him with ""a feeling that the two sides were willing to move step by step towards better relations.""","Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said dismantling nuclear facilities is a red line .

"Perugia, Italy (CNN) -- Amanda Knox, the American student convicted of killing her British roommate Meredith Kercher in Italy, faced a surprise accusation Monday from another man behind bars for the murder. Rudy Guede refused to say Knox was not involved -- and prosecutor Giuliano Mignini read out a letter saying Guede thought the American and her then-boyfriend had killed Kercher. Guede wrote to a news website in the spring of 2010, after the three were convicted, referring to ""a horrible homicide of a splendid young girl, Meredith Kercher, by Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito."" Mignini produced a copy of the letter on Monday during Knox's appeal against her conviction. Defense lawyers said they did not know of the existence of the letter before Mignini read it in court. Knox took the stand for emotional testimony after Guede spoke, saying she was ""shocked."" ""The only time that Rudy Guede, Raffaele Sollecito and I were in one room together was in a court room.... He knows what the truth is. I don't know what happened that night,"" she said. Monday's appeal hearing was the first time the three people convicted of the crime appeared in court together since a preliminary hearing years ago. Kercher was found stabbed to death in 2007 at the house she shared with Knox in Perugia, the central Italian town where both were students. She was semi-naked and her throat had been slashed. Knox, 23, and her then-boyfriend Sollecito, 27, were convicted of the murder in 2009. Guede was found guilty in a separate fast-track trial and sentenced to 16 years. Defense lawyer Carlo della Vedova and Knox's mother Edda Mellas both rejected Guede's testimony Monday. Her father Curt Knox, speaking to CNN from Seattle, said it was ""very disappointing that he will not own up to his responsibility."" Under cross-examination, Guede said he had written what he always believed, but that it ""was not up to me to say who was the killer."" Della Vedova said Guede's letter was based on ""a feeling"" and that his accusations are not based on facts or events he witnessed. Mellas said Guede ""continues to lie about Amanda and that's unfortunate."" ""He didn't say much. He refused to answer most of the important things,"" she said. ""Amanda wanted to be able to confront him and she was denied that."" Mellas said she had suffered watching her daughter testify: ""It's devastating to watch your child in pain. It's horrible to see her go through that."" She said before the hearing she cannot understand why Guede might spend only seven years behind bars if he is released early for good conduct, while Knox could serve 26 years. Sollecito said Monday he and Knox had been behind bars for nearly four years, their lives destroyed based only on suppositions. Francesco Maresca, the lawyer for the Kercher family, said Guede's testimony was the first time he has said ""clearly that the two defendants were present in the scene of the crime that night."" The hearing is now adjourned until July 25, with further hearings on July 30 and August 1. The appeal hearing has heard a confusing array of stories from a range of convicted criminals this month. Guede had been called as a witness to corroborate the story of another convict who told the court just over a week ago that Guede had said Knox and Sollecito were not involved. But on the stand, he did not back Mario Alessi's version of events. As part of the appeal, forensic experts are retesting evidence that was used to convict Knox. That evidence includes a knife found in Sollecito's apartment with Knox's DNA on the handle and what Perugia prosecutors say is Kercher's DNA in a tiny groove on the blade. The prosecution contends that the knife was used to stab Kercher in the neck and that it had been cleaned. The DNA matter attributed to Kercher consists of flesh, not blood, they say. The sample, however, was so small that forensic scientists investigating Kercher's murder were not able to double-test it in accordance with international forensic science norms, which Knox's legal team says raises doubts about its validity. The second piece of evidence the forensic experts are testing is the tiny metal clasp from Kercher's bra, which was cut from her body after her slaying. An independent forensics study on the DNA evidence is due Thursday, Curt Knox said Monday. ""We're hopefully going to hear good news that it's incompatibale to Amanda and not useful,"" Knox said. Forensic scientists in the investigatory phase determined that Sollecito's DNA is present on the metal clasp. The clasp was identified on an investigatory video the same day Kercher's body was found. But it was not collected until nearly six weeks later, giving the defense cause to question whether the sample may have been contaminated. CNN's Hada Messia and Dan Rivers contributed to this report.","NEW: Knox hopes DNA report due Thursday will help her defense, her father says .

"(CNN)  -- A paramedic accused of plotting to extort $25 million from actor John Travolta after his 16-year-old son died in the Bahamas told a jury Wednesday the boy had been dead for some time before the ambulance service was called. John Travolta's 16-year-old son, Jett, died in the Bahamas in January after having a seizure. Tarino Lightbourn said in his statement to the Nassau, Bahamas, jury that a doctor told medics to keep administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation on Jett Travolta despite knowing the teen was dead, and that the ambulance company was told to transport him to the hospital -- something not usually done if a person was already dead. Lightbourn and former Bahamian Sen. Pleasant Bridgewater are on trial on charges they attempted to extort money from Travolta after his son's January 2 death from a seizure. In Bahamian courts, defendants are allowed to make a statement without being placed under oath and will not face cross-examination. Earlier in the trial, Travolta testified that his son was found unresponsive by a nanny at the home on the island of Grand Bahama, where the family was spending the New Year's holiday. Lightbourn said Jett Travolta's veins had collapsed and his body was stiff as he lay on the bathroom floor. Someone in the room suggested that those present would receive a lot of money if they stayed quiet, he said, adding he thought this was part of a cover-up. Lightbourn did not say to whom he was referring. Travolta testified he initially told the ambulance driver to rush them to an airport where his private jet was parked and where Travolta, who is a pilot, planned to fly his son to a West Palm Beach, Florida, hospital instead of driving him to one in nearby Freeport. The paramedic, however, asked Travolta to sign a statement releasing the ambulance company from liability. ""I received a liability of release document. I signed it. I did not read it. Time was of the essence,"" Travolta testified earlier in the trial. While he and his wife were riding in the ambulance with their son, they decided to divert to the hospital. At the hospital, the actor was told his son ""wasn't alive,"" he said. In her statement, Bridgewater said she advised Lightbourn not to sell the document because she was trying to protect the Travoltas and the Bahamas. She said she was concerned Travolta would tell his friends not to travel to the Bahamas because of the lack of privacy. Lightbourn said Wednesday that he asked attorney Bridgewater to assist him in negotiations with Travolta's attorneys. Travolta earlier testified he learned of a demand for $25 million, or ""stories connected to that document would be sold to the press ... The stories would imply the death of my son was intentional and I was culpable somehow."" Travolta attorney Michael McDermott testified that he assisted police in a sting by secretly recording meeting with the defendants in a Nassau hotel room. Bahamian police had placed wireless microphones on McDermott and hidden two cameras in his room, McDermott said. Lightbourn said his eyes popped when Travolta's attorney offered him $15 million for the document Travolta signed. Travolta's attorney testified the negotiations between Lightbourn and himself were all part of the Bahamian police sting. On Wednesday, Travolta attorney Michael Ossi told CNN he could not comment on specifics in the case. ""The statements made today are not evidence, but what has already been placed into evidence speaks for itself,"" he said. Defense attorneys have attempted to convince the jury that Travolta's attorney came to the Bahamas to ""set up"" their clients. Murrio Ducille, who represents Bridgewater, said to Travolta's attorney, ""you came to the island with evil in your heart."" The trial is expected to wrap up early next week when the jury will begin its deliberations. Travolta and his wife, actress Kelly Preston, are not expected back in court. Journalist Arthia Nixon in Nassau, Bahamas, contributed to this report.","Paramedic on trial, accused of plotting to extort $25 million from John Travolta .

"(CNN) -- After traveling seven hours in the Chevy Impala he drives for work, Cliff Roberts wasn't overly concerned when he started feeling as if his legs were asleep -- stinging and vaguely numb. It's probably because you didn't get out of the car enough, Patti Roberts remembers telling her husband, before the pair went about their day in 2007. Later that week, with the numbness in Cliff's legs still coming and going, Patti sat down to watch the episode of ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" that would eventually help save her husband's life. With boundless health information available at the click of a TV remote or computer mouse, patients such as Patti and Cliff have come to rely on these media as they would a doctor's visit. See, the next morning, after the couples' two sons headed off to school, Patti and Cliff thought to take romantic advantage of their empty Tampa, Florida, home. But for the first time in their more than 20 years together, Cliff wasn't able to perform. Then Patti had a thought. Dr. Mehmet Oz had spoken about symptoms that precede a heart attack on Oprah's show the day before -- one of which was erectile dysfunction because of slowed blood flow. Cliff was no stranger to indigestion, and the couple had previously disregarded the pressure he felt in his abdomen -- yet another sign that a heart attack could be looming. ""There's a lot of useful information that people get from TV,"" said Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist, assistant professor of medicine at Emory University. ""But [TV personalities] can carry so much influence on patients, that sometimes [the patient] ... will ask for tests that they may not necessarily benefit from."" Same goes for the Internet. The term cyberchondria -- a digital age-play on hypochondria -- has been tossed around since the early-to-mid 2000s, when searching symptoms online became commonplace. ""Dr. Google has certainly sent me his share of referrals,"" Bergquist jokes. ""A lot of my patients do a preliminary search, and get frightened by something they read. They'll go to the doctor for something they wouldn't have initially gone for."" That's what Patti and Cliff worried about as they spoke with the paramedics at their home. But Cliff agreed to go to the hospital, despite his perfect electrocardiogram and slightly high blood pressure. ""Part of me was thinking I may have overreacted,"" Patti said. By 1 p.m. the next day, the emergency room doctor told Cliff he was lucky not to have had a heart attack. His left main coronary artery, often called the widow maker, was 90% blocked. ""People will hear something and it's like, it's meant,"" Oz told CNN. ""It's fate. They were meant to hear it. Of course there were millions of other people who heard it who didn't think anything about it. But [Patti] needed to hear that message. And somehow she hung onto it."" Patients who play an active role in their care, which can include searching symptoms online, have better health outcomes, Bergquist said. However, she said, it's important to remember: The more common the symptom, the more likely it is that a misdiagnosis will occur. For example, something as broad as a cough could be anything from a benign cold to lung cancer. Cyberchondria occurs when people jump right to the worst-case scenario. ""Physicians can add the perspective and knowledge of putting symptoms together in terms of a patient's history,"" she said. Alternatively, searching rarer symptoms will yield fewer possible diagnoses, she said, adding, ""That can sometimes offer more help than a physician can."" Thanks to the Internet, one of Bergquist's patients found that her ""brain shock"" was a side effect of coming off serotonin to treat anxiety and depression. ""I wasn't aware that could be a potential side effect ... and since she's brought it to my attention, I can tell other patients,"" Bergquist said. Although Cliff and Patti now readily turn to the Internet and TV, they know it can't replace a relationship with a doctor. But the Web and the doctor can complement each other. Still, after having three heart stents implanted in 2007, another in 2011 and being healthy on paper, Cliff began feeling some chest discomfort this spring. Patti turned to the Web and found reassurance. ""[Stents are] a scary thing to look up,"" Patti said. ""If I find really bad news, I'll try to find something in the middle that gives you the truth but doesn't freak you out. I was able to pull from it that [the discomfort] is a normal thing that happens after you have one. ... Maybe last time the artery was in a different place."" Sticking to legitimate websites is the safest bet, Bergquist said. ""As a general rule, any website that ends in .gov or .edu is going to offer reliable information,"" she said, noting a physician plays a vital role in reaching an accurate diagnosis. But if used correctly, the Internet and TV can make you a more educated and empowered patient -- and maybe even save your life.","The term cyberchondria is a digital age version of hypochondria .

"Kampala, Uganda (CNN) -- Uganda's president Saturday vowed to sign sweeping anti-gay legislation, citing what he said were scientific, not political, considerations for a controversial measure in a country that already criminalizes homosexuality. In a statement, President Yoweri Museveni declared debate on the legislation over and said he was not concerned about the expected international outcry. His remarks, made during a conference of the ruling National Resistance Movement, drew loud applause from supporters. ""We shall have a war with the homosexual lobby in the world, but backed by these people (scientists) and you,"" he told supporters. A Ugandan lawmaker first introduced the bill in 2009 with a death penalty clause for some homosexual acts. It was briefly shelved when Britain and other European nations threatened to withdraw aid to Uganda, which relies on millions of dollars from the international community. The nation's parliament passed the bill in December, supplanting the death penalty provision with a proposal of life in prison for ""aggravated homosexuality."" It includes acts where one person is infected with HIV, ""serial offenders"" and sex with minors, Amnesty International said. In cases where one has HIV, the punishment applies even when the sex is consensual or protected. Museveni said that scientists examining the issue determined there was no gene for homosexuality and that it was merely abnormal behavior. He said in a statement that he sought ""a scientific ... not a political answer. Let the scientists answer this. And according to the way they have answered it, if they mislead us, they are the ones who are responsible."" He said, ""The question I put to them was, are there people born like this? Now they are saying they are no such people."" According to Amnesty International, the bill's definition of ""aggravated homosexuality"" includes acts in which a person is infected with HIV, ""serial offenders"" and sex with minors. The bill also proposed years in prison for anyone who counsels or reaches out to gays and lesbians, a provision that would ensnare rights groups and others providing services to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Homosexuality is illegal in most African countries, where sodomy laws were introduced during colonialism. According to Amnesty International, homosexuality is illegal in 38 of 54 African countries. In Uganda, homosexual acts are punishable by 14 years to life in prison, according to rights activists. But lawmakers in the conservative nation sought tougher legislation, saying the influence of Western lifestyles risks destroying family units. Homosexuality is taboo in African countries and activists say few Africans are openly gay, fearing imprisonment, violence and loss of their jobs. Museveni appears to be balancing the desire to please a conservative constituency vehemently opposed to homosexuality with hopes of not alienating Western aid donors to the east African country. Last month, he declined to sign the bill, but the move was not designed to protect the civil rights of gays and lesbians. Museveni believed that Parliament illegally passed the bill, and gays and lesbians are ""sick people who need help,"" his spokesman said at the time. The president had sent a letter to the speaker of Parliament, saying that he couldn't sign the bill because there weren't enough Parliament members present when it was passed. ""Homosexuals need help. They are sick,"" spokesman Tamale Mirundi said, explaining the president's thinking. ""Homosexuals were present in Africa in the past and were not persecuted."" At the ruling party conference this week, however, Museveni said he was persuaded of the need to sign the bill by his scientific advisers, who cited, among other reasons, the ""serious public health consequences"" of homosexuality. Where last month, the president, through his spokesman, seemed to perceive homosexuality as an illness, now Museveni seemed to be following the lead of a government committee that declared Friday that homosexuality is ""not a disease but merely an abnormal behavior which may be learned through experiences in life."" In a statement, the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights said the bill would ""place the lives of countless Ugandans at risk"" and ""had already intensified the climate of hatred and persecution"" against gay people in Uganda. ""The international community has a legal and moral obligation to prevent this law from being implemented,"" the center said.","President Yoweri Museveni declares debate anti-gay legislation over .

"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- Brazil's Senate passed a controversial forestry bill late Tuesday, supported by ranchers and farmers but opposed by many environmental activists. Supporters say the legislation will help cut carbon emissions and establish more realistic deforestation rules in what has become Brazil's fast-growing agricultural frontier. After a long debate, senators voted 59 to 7 to approve the legislation. The new ""forest code"" now returns to the lower house for approval and then must be signed by the president. The bill reduces the percentage of land that farmers and ranchers must maintain as forest when they develop it. It also establishes an amnesty for some past illegal deforestation. Critics say it will encourage developers to continue to illegally cut down the Amazon forest while supporters say it brings the country's legal framework in line with reality. In recent years, private ranchers and growers as well as the government have invested millions to expand soybean and beef production and build massive hydroelectric dams in the region. ""Brazil has to take care of the environment, but at the same time it also has a responsibility to feed the world,"" Senator Jorge Viana said in a statement released by a pro-legislation lobby. Brazil is the world's No. 1 beef exporter and second biggest soy exporter. On Monday, Brazil announced that deforestation in the Amazon had fallen to a record low for the third straight year, providing more support for the forest code. Under the approved rules, developers will still be required to preserve some land as forest and replant other areas, thus helping cut carbon emissions. But stricter limits and fines have been stripped out of it. Environmentalists say that changes to the decades-old regulations on deforestation were necessary, but that the amnesties granted in this bill are excessive. Greenpeace Brasil called it a ""Day of Shame."" It is expected to land on the desk of President Dilma Rousseff early next year. It could prove a challenge for the new leader, who has supported development initiatives in the region, but who must also placate left-wing environmentalists in her coalition.","Supporters say the legislation is realistic .

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich look simply unstoppable and uncatchable in the Bundesliga as Eintracht Frankfurt were the latest team to be swept aside Sunday with a 5-0 rout re-opening a 13-point advantage at the top. It was Bayern's record 44th unbeaten game in the German championship and their third since returning from the midwinter break. A 71,000 capacity crowd at their Allianz Arena witnessed another masterclass for last season's treble winners, which has left them with 53 points after 19 games. With the domestic league title all but wrapped up, the big test for Pep Guardiola's men is their defense of the Champions League title and a last 16 clash with English Premier League Arsenal later this month is a mouthwatering prospect. Arsenal began a crucial part of their season with a 2-0 home win over Crystal Palace Sunday as the returning Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain scored twice in the second half at the Emirates. The victory has taken them back to the top of the standings two points ahead of Manchester City, who host third-placed Chelsea in a crunch clash Monday night. Earlier Sunday, Liverpool lost more ground in the title race after being held 1-1 at struggling West Bromwich Albion in an earlier kick off. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was delighted to have England international Oxlade-Chamberlian back in the fold, particularly after revealing new midfield loan signing Kim Kallstrom will likely be out until March with an ongoing back problem, missing the Bayern ties. ""It was a great day for Chamberlain,"" Wenger told Sky Sports. ""He was out for a long, long time and we needed to be patient to get him back to full fitness. He had a great game and scored two great goals."" With Bayern in their current form, Arsenal will have to be at their sparkling best to avoid a repeat of their defeat to the Bavarian giants in last year's Champions League. Mario Goetz put Bayern ahead in the 12th minute against Frankfurt with a superb volleyed effort and Franck Ribery doubled the advantage just before the break. It might have been an even wider margin of victory as the home side twice hit the woodwork before Arjen Robben scored the third shortly after coming on as a substitute. Defender Dante added a fourth with 20 minutes to go and Mario Mandzukic rounded off the rout with a fifth. Guardiola's influence on Bayern since taking over at the start of the season is also shining through. While in charge of Barcelona's he helped them perfect their ""tiki taka"" style of quick passing -- which was also adopted by the all-conquering Spanish national team under the late Luis Aragones -- whose death was announced Saturday. Guardiola signed midfielder Thiago Alcantara from Barcelona to Bayern on taking charge and the value of that acquisition was evidenced Sunday as the Spain international set a new Bundesliga record for touches of the ball against Frankfurt. He passed the ball an incredible 185 times in the 90 minutes as Bayern dominated possession. ""They showed from the start who was the boss,"" purred ex-Bayern great and now club president Franz Beckenbauer. ""At the break they could have been three of four-nil ahead,"" he told AFP. Bayer Leverkusen had briefly closed top within 10 points with victory over Stuttgart Saturday, with Borussia Dortmund a further four points adrift after a much-needed win on Friday. Meanwhile, in Serie A, Juventus took a nine-point lead with a 3-1 home win over struggling Inter Milan. Stephan Lichsteiner, Giorgio Chiellini, and Arturo Vidal scored inside the hour for Juve before Rolando's late consolation. With second-placed Roma's home match againsdt Parma abandoned after nine minutes in the Italian capital due to weather conditions, the champions moved further clear with a commanding display.","Bayern Munich stretch unbeaten Bundesliga record to 44 games .

"New York (CNN) -- The world's largest computer chip maker Intel faces an uncertain future. In a post-PC world where mobile is king, the Silicon Valley stalwart is aware it's fallen behind on innovation. But in an effort to turn the tide, Intel unveiled a bevy of concept products reflecting the latest industry trend -- the Internet of Things (IoT) at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this month. There were gesture tracking 3D cameras, smart earbuds that can track fitness activities, a bluetooth personal assistant headset nicknamed ""Jarvis"" after Iron Man's own virtual aide, a baby monitor of the future in the form of a onesie that observes the child and relays information back to the parent and smart watches galore. Behind the bold strategic expansion is Renee James, the highest-ranked female at the company and president of Intel. A veteran of the tech giant with over 25 years experience, James makes up one half of Intel's new two-person executive duo along with CEO Brian Krzanich. Together they manage over 100,000 employees worldwide. ""We're very excited about the strategy and what we're going to do with the company,"" James tells CNN. ""When I started in this industry, we were all about building PCs, in the early-mid 90s. And PCs at the time changed the way people lived. ""We invented mobile laptops, so we were very good at a certain kind of mobile. What we didn't do, and I think that we got behind on, was going even lower -- phones."" With an established smartphone market already in place, James is pushing the chip maker to focus on the recently announced ""Edison"" product which they tout as a computer the size of an SD card and other highly-integrated smaller processors like their new ""Quark"" chips, tailor-made for wearable tech applications. The software side of the business is an arena she knows well. Over the years James -- who was recently named one of Fortune's most powerful women in business -- has spearheaded company strategy through various R&D leadership positions at Intel. ""I do a lot more of what you would consider operational, the manufacturing, human resources. But I did keep the business units that I had before -- software services, security."" During her ascent to the top of the corporate ladder, James got to work under Andrew Grove -- a pioneer in the semiconductor industry. A legend in his own right, James says meeting Grove was one of the most important moments in her career. Not that the initial introduction during a presentation went all that smoothly. ""We got into a little bit of an argument because he started to tell me how [the technology] worked and I said, 'No, no, no.' And apparently you don't argue with Andy Grove. ""I was too young, too stupid to know better ... So I thought I'm going to get fired."" But for Grove, it was quite the opposite. He liked her gumption and years later made James his technical assistant and then chief of staff. ""He's a fabulous mentor. I learned more about thinking, about industry structures and strategy and [about] 'what's the real issue?' from him than I'll learn from anybody."" Despite this wealth of knowledge and experience, many questioned her appointment as the company's number two in early 2013. ""I expected it. There haven't been a lot of women at the top of semiconductor companies,"" she says. ""Mostly [the criticism] makes me want to be more successful ... I try to focus on what [Intel] needs to do to be successful. What's the next big thing?'

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid shot to the top of La Liga on Saturday night after they won and their city rivals Atletico suffered a shock loss at Almeria. Diego Simeone's side surrender first place on goal difference following a four-goal swing on Saturday night as Real Madrid beat Villarreal 4-2 and Atletico lost 2-0. Relegation-threatened Almeria scored twice in the last 10 minutes to seal an unlikely victory with both goals coming courtesy of midfielder Verza -- the second from the penalty spot after Atletico goalkeeper Daniel Aranzubia saw red. Carlo Ancelotti's side had a more routine evening at the Bernabeu in large part thanks to Gareth Bale. With Cristiano Ronaldo serving the first game of a three-match suspension after being sent off last weekend, it was left to the Bale, who returned to action after missing the three previous games with a calf injury, to guide Los Blancos to three points. The Welsh international put Real ahead in the seventh minute, seizing on a mistake by center back Chechu Dorado before chipping the ball home past goalkeeper Sergio Asenjo to score his 11th goal of the season. Eighteen minutes later, Bale turned provider with a cross from the right which was met by Karim Benzema who doubled the lead. The visitors put themselves back in the game two minutes before the break with a superb strike from Mario Gaspar, but Madrid settled supporter's nerves by re-establishing a two-goal lead in the 64th minute -- 20-year-old striker Jese providing the finish. Back came Villarreal five minutes later with a Giovani Dos Santos free kick which set up what could have been a nervous last 20 minutes for the home side, but the game was put to bed by Benzema with his second of the night in the 76th minute. The results give both Real and Atletico 57 points from 23 games but with Real shading the goal difference by one (plus 41 goals versus plus 40). Elsewhere in La Liga, Rayo Vallecano recorded a resounding 4-1 win over Malaga to lift the second-from-bottom side level on 20 points with 18th place Valladolid who play Elche on Sunday. Valencia moved up to eighth with an even more emphatic win following their brilliant 3-2 win at the Nou Camp last weekend. A 5-0 drubbing of bottom side Betis Sevilla means Juan Antonio Pizzi's side are now level on 31 points with Sevilla who will be hoping they can repeat Valencia's trick when they host Barcelona on Sunday evening. Over in Italy, there were wins for all three home sides on Saturday. Third-place Napoli were 3-1 winners over AC Milan who remain in 10th place. Fourth-place Fiorentina beat Atalanta 2-0 while Udinese beat ChievoVerona 3-0. Leaders Juventus travel to Hellas Verona on Sunday while second-place Roma will face local rivals Lazio in the Stadio Olimpico. Donetsk mourns Maicon . A busy day of European football was marred by tragedy off the pitch as Shakhtar Donetsk announced their Brazilian striker Maicon Pereira de Oliveira had been killed in a car accident. A statement published on the club's website read: ""FC Shakhtar regretfully informs that on 8 February 2014 the life of a footballer Maicon Pereira de Oliveira tragically ended. He died in a car crash in Donetsk."" ""He was a talented footballer, open and friendly guy. Maicon loved life and knew how to make it positive and bright. Tragic, untimely and absurd death took away a wonderful person from our ranks. Maicon was only 25 years old. ""It is a terrible bereavement for each of us. FC Shakhtar expresses condolences and sympathy to Maicon's family and friends. May he rest in peace..."" Maicon joined the Ukrainian champions from Volyn Lutsk in 2012 and made six appearances. At the time of his death he was on loan to fellow Ukrainian side Illichivets Mariupol. Shakhtar captain Darijo Srna said: ""I have no words. We have lost a very good man, a friend, a colleague, a friend. This is a difficult and tragic moment in the life of Shakhtar and its fans."" Read more: Liverpool hammer Arsenal .

"(CNN)  -- France coach Raymond Domenech has described the strike by his players over forward Nicolas Anelka's expulsion from the squad as ""unspeakably stupid."" Domenech said he fully supported the French Federation's decision to send the Chelsea striker home following an angry bust-up with the coach at half-time during France's 2-0 defeat to Mexico. ""Nobody can behave in such a way in the dressing room or elsewhere and high-level sportsmen and women have to lead by example through football,"" Domenech told reporters in Bloemfontein ahead of Tuesday's clash with South Africa. ""We tried to convince the players that what was happening was irregular, that their actions were unspeakably stupid. I told myself this mascarade had to be stopped. No way would I back this action."" The French squad resumed training on Monday a day after the players refused to train in support of Anelka. Domenech, who is stepping down as national coach after the World Cup, described their actions as ""an aberration and an imbecility"". Pedro Pinto: Heads should roll for French farce . French sports minister Roselyne Bachelot was due to hold talks with Domenech and his players on Monday and said the nation felt ""great indignation"" over the collapse of the team's World Cup challenge into infighting and allegations of treachery, according to Agence France-Presse. The former world champions face a humiliating early exit from the tournament if they fail to beat hosts South Africa, or if Group A rivals Mexico and Uruguay draw in the day's other game. Anelka flew home to London on Sunday after being dropped from the squad following his angry confrontation with Domenech. But French captain Patrice Evra was reported to be incensed that details of the incident were leaked to the media, claiming there was a ""traitor"" in the French camp. A public training session on Sunday was halted after Evra was involved in a shouting match with fitness coach Robert Duverne, who reacted by angrily throwing down his official accreditation badge. Domenech refused to confirm whether Evra would retain the captaincy armband against the host nation. ""All I expect of the players and what the French people are expecting of them is not excuses and more words but behaviour and results on the pitch,"" he added. ""My responsibility is to prepare them for tomorrow's game and that's all that counts. ""They will have to play their hearts out tomorrow on the pitch and we can still dream at this stage."" The squad, who said they only turned out to greet fans, promptly walked off and were joined by Domenech on the bus, who then emerged to read a statement on behalf of the players to declare their unanimous opposition to the decision of the French Football Federation to send Anelka home. ""They made a decision without consulting all the players, only on the basis of the 'facts' reported by the press. Accordingly, and to mark their opposition to the highest level of French football, all players decided not to participate in the work-out."" But the players said they would ""do everything individually and in a collective spirit so that France regains its honor against South Africa on Tuesday."" To add to the confusion, French team director Jean-Louis Valentin publicly announced his resignation to the media. ""Ask the players, they do not want to involve themselves any more. It's unacceptable,"" he told AFP. ""They don't want to train. It's a scandal for the French, it's a scandal for the federation and the French team. It is a shame. As for me, it's over. I'm leaving the federation. I'm sickened and disgusted."" France's leading sports newspaper, L'Equipe, criticized Manchester United defender Evra on Monday, questioning his behavior as captain, AFP reported. ""Patrice Evra definitively showed that he confused the role of captain with being a leader of a gang. He has neither the capacity, nor the charisma nor the qualities to don the captain's armband,"" the newspaper said. French bank Credit Agricole said Monday it had canceled planned television ads featuring the national team, according to AFP. French hamburger chain Quick has already canceled ads featuring Anelka.","NEW: France coach Domenech describes players' strike as ""unspeakably stupid""

"(CNN) -- Syrian rebels want a new government. The current Syrian government says first you have to stop the terrorists, meaning the rebels. The international community wants it all to happen simultaneously. As a result, a second round of peace talks intended to plot a path for ending almost three years of civil war in Syria ground perilously close to a halt Friday. ""I express my deepest apologies that this meeting did not result in any progress,"" Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Makdad told reporters after meeting with the opposition and U.N. mediator Lakhdar Brahimi. ""Probably we are going to pause for a while to see if the regime will engage again in a political solution, not any delay tactics,"" said Louay Safi of the opposition Syrian National Coalition. Violence resumes . Even as peace proceedings were held, the United Nations expressed alarm about a military buildup in the town of Yabroud near the Lebanese border may lead to a mass exodus and more bloodshed. Yabroud is an opposition-held area in the Qalamoun mountains, said Rupert Colville, spokesman for the U.N.'s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. ""According to reports we've received from within Syria, there have been numerous aerial attacks and shelling along with a military buildup around the town, suggesting that a major assault by land may be imminent,"" Colville said. Refugees are already arriving in Lebanon, said spokeswoman Melissa Fleming of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. ""Right now, we've had between 500 and 600 families who have arrived in the town of Arsal in Lebanon, citing their fear for this attack as being the reason they fled over the border,"" Fleming said. Fleming expressed fears of a big refugee flight similar to the one in Qusayr last year, when Syrians abandoned that town for Arsal as government forces successfully took Qusayr from rebels after seven weeks of fighting. Elsewhere in Syria, a car bomb exploded Friday near the Al Braa Bin Malik Mosque in the village of Yadouda in rural Daraa, said the Syrian Coalition. The suicide bombing killed 32 people, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Mosques are flooded with worshippers during the Friday prayers, and the coalition blamed the attack on the Syrian regime, which didn't immediately have a comment. Snail-paced talks . The snail-paced peace talks, which started last month with Brahimi serving as an intermediary between the two delegations sitting in the same room, have failed to produce an agreement on a first step for resolving the conflict that has killed more than 100,000 people and caused millions to flee their homes. This week, Safi's side presented its proposal for a transitional government that would oversee a halt in the fighting, releasing prisoners of conscience, maintaining law and order, bringing justice to those responsible for violence and protecting human rights. Its plan excludes President Bashar al-Assad from continued leadership, an outcome unacceptable to the longtime Syrian leader. Makdad said the opposition has ""an unrealistic agenda,"" and he insisted the first step must be ""stopping the violence and ending terrorism."" The government refers to the rebels as foreign-backed terrorists, so Makdad's stance in essence calls for the opposition to unilaterally lay down its arms. ""We confirm we are willing to discuss the issue of the transitional government after we reach an agreement regarding ending terrorism,"" he said. To Safi, the government position was intended to delay progress in the talks while its forces continue attacks on its own people. He called on the international community, including key government ally Russia, to pressure al-Assad to adhere to the Geneva communique that led to the talks. It calls for ending the conflict and establishing a transitional government. Russia's role . Makdad, however, made a point of declaring that the government's relationship with ""our friends in Russia"" was ""very deep,"" and that the two allies would continue to coordinate on how to proceed. The United States and some of its Western allies accuse Russia of protecting the Assad regime to keep it in power. U.S. officials are awaiting for Moscow to demonstrate its intentions about humanitarian relief efforts in Syria, said Marie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman. When asked whether the Russians were playing for time as a diplomatic cover on behalf of Syria, Harf stated: ""I don't want to guess what the motivations of the Russians are. We have said very clearly that if the Russians come out and talk about the importance of humanitarian access, they need to back up those words with actions."" So far, the only hint of progress in the talks has been a localized cease-fire to allow some evacuations and aid relief for the besieged city of Homs. U.N. Emergency Relief Coordinator Valerie Amos said Friday that 1,400 people were evacuated from the Old City of Homs and 2,500 still there got relief supplies, but she lamented the bleak humanitarian situation throughout Syria. ""Civilians are under fire, and the social fabric of Syria has been torn to shreds,"" Amos said, adding that ""all parties are failing in their responsibility to protect civilians."" In her statement on a briefing she gave the U.N. Security Council, Amos said: ""No amount of words can adequately describe the horrific reality facing civilians."" Syrians forced to eat grass .

"(CNN) -- Singer Fantasia Barrino revealed during a concert Sunday what has been rumored for months -- she is pregnant. ""God has given me this child and I don't have to hide it from none of y'all,"" Barrino told fans at the outdoor show in Jacksonville, Florida. The 2004 ""American Idol"" winner did not say when the baby is due or who is the father. Her manager did not immediately respond to CNN requests for information. ""You are the first person that I share this news with, and I share this with you because I can relate to you,"" Barrino told fans. ""And for a while I walked around figuring out 'What will they say and what will they think about me?' But now I tell you I don't live my life for folk."" Barrino's weight gain fueled online rumors seven months ago that the R&B singer was expecting a child, but her manager said she was gaining 45 pounds in preparation to play legendary gospel singer Mahalia Jackson in a movie. ""Fantasia's pregnant with prosperity,"" manager Brian Dickens told CNN on February 8, 2011. The past year has been difficult for the 27-year-old Barrino, who acknowledged a relationship with a married man last summer. She initially denied knowing Antwaun Cook was married. She was treated at a Charlotte, North Carolina, hospital for a ""sleep aid"" overdose several days after Cook's wife filed a child-custody petition that included allegations of the affair. Barrino later testified in the child custody case that she knew from the first day of her relationship with Cook that he was married and still living with his wife, according to court records. Barrino, who has a 9-year-old daughter, delivered a lecture to her younger fans during Sunday's show, telling them ""Take my word and run with it."" ""Little girls, take your time with little boys,"" Barrino said. ""Little boys, respect the little girls."" Barrino's raw talent as a songstress, combined with her hard-luck story as a teenage mother, won her many fans, starting with her winning the third season of ""American Idol."" Her six-year-long entertainment career has been pockmarked with adversity, including being sued by her own father and well-publicized financial troubles.","""God has given me this child and I don't have to hide it,"" Barrino says .

"(CNN) -- If the Winter Olympics leave you cold, then we are here to help. Ahead of Friday's opening ceremony in Sochi, let us thaw your icy hearts with 10 reasons why you should watch the snow men and ice queens compete at the Games. Lessons in luge . Had your fill of football? Tired of tennis? Then help is at hand for the next three weeks. Once every four years, mainstream sports make way for the obscure delights of bobsleigh and biathlon, curling and luge. There is even more novelty at the 2014 Games, with 12 new events joining the Olympic program, including ski and snowboard slopestyle and ski halfpipe competitions. Slopestyle is similar to skateboarding on snow, as athletes use rails, pipes and jumps to make their way down the course. The halfpipe ski athletes are also set to wow the crowd as they perform tricks in the center of an icy ramp measuring 234 meters in length and 7 meters deep! Gruesome Games . What do you get if you combine snow, ice and high-speed sport? The answer is accidents. The Winter Olympics provide plenty of ""oohs and aahs"" for a willing audience as the athletes try to avoid injury, and not always successfully. ""At the last Olympics (in Vancouver 2010) I was one of the statistics,"" British snowboard cross star Zoe Gillings, who regularly travel down the slopes at 50 mph, told CNN. ""I damaged the cartilage to my knee but one girl broke her back. Other typical snowboard-cross injuries are broken ankles, concussion, pretty much torn ligaments in your entire body and broken bones all over as well. ""It can be quite gruesome."" A study by the British Journal of Sports Medicine following the 2010 Winter Games found bobsleigh, ice hockey, short-track skating, freestyle skiing and snowboard cross were the most injury-prone sports. But the International Olympic Committee (IOC) told CNN that, although the severity of injuries differ, a surprisingly similar number of athletes are hurt at the Summer and Winter Games, with 10-11% of all athletes in 2010 and 2012 picking up an injury. Hot and cold competitors . Once every four years the Winter Olympics surprise us with the fact that sizzling nations, who know no snow, send teams to compete on the white stuff. The A-Z of countries who have already qualified for Sochi includes African hot spots Togo and Zimbabwe, the Pacific island of Tonga and the Caribbean Cayman Islands. These athletes from tropical nations often warm the hearts of TV audiences looking for an underdog to cheer on. That was the case in 1988 when the haphazard Jamaican bobsleigh team brought some sunshine to the Calgary Games and inspired the cult film ""Cool Runnings."" After a 12-year absence, Jamaica is set to compete in the two-man bob after Winston Watts and Marvin Dixon used crowd funding to help pay their way to Sochi. Lindsey who? American ski queen Lindsey Vonn may be gone from the Sochi Games but there is still an avalanche of alpine stars to support. Californian snowboarder Shaun White -- like Vonn already a household name in the U.S -- and Chicago's superstar speed skater Shani Davis are going for a ""three-peat"" in Russia. Davis, the first black athlete from any nation to win an individual Winter Olympics title, and White are both aiming to do what no other American male has done before -- win three successive gold medals. At Vancouver 2010, more than 29 million Americans tuned in to watch White, Vonn and Davis triumph -- and the prime-time coverage of the Games even managed to end the six-year streak of ""American Idol"" at the top of the U.S. TV ratings! There are plenty of global stars to watch, too. The grace and speed of ice dancing queen South Korean Kim Yu-na is not to be missed while best-selling violinist Vanessa Mae swaps her bow for ski poles as she represents Thailand in the slalom. Hockey heroes . Will the world witness another ""Miracle on Ice"" at the 2014 Games? There's only one way to find out -- watch the Olympic ice hockey competition. The USA's victory over an all-conquering Soviet Union side at the 1980 Lake Placid Games is frozen in time as a classic David vs. Goliath encounter, and it also helped the American men go on to win an unlikely gold medal. Four years ago in Vancouver, the men's ice hockey final served up some more red-hot action on the ice as Canada edged a 4-3 victory over the U.S. in overtime. The Winter Olympics provides a rare opportunity to see some of the National Hockey League's top names compete on a global stage. Sid ""The Kid"" Crosby -- reportedly the highest-paid player in the NHL -- will captain defending champion Canada. Get your skates on . Who needs spoof movie classic ""Blades of Glory"" or television's ""Skating with the Stars"" when you can marvel over the real ice queens, and kings, on the rink in Russia? American Jackson Haines is credited as the father of figure skating after he sprinkled a dose of ballet moves to his skating routines in the late 1800s, and now today's ice dancing duos express themselves with music from ""Les Miserables"" to Michael Jackson. If you thought the moonwalk was hard, just imagine doing it in ice skates. For those of you whose legs turn to jelly during the annual Christmas trip to the ice rink, the speed skating events offer reassurance that Olympic skaters fall over too. Steven Bradbury skated into Games legend when he won gold at Salt Lake City in 2002. The Australian watched his rivals ahead of him tumble out in the 1,000m short track final and cruised through to win, becoming the first athlete from the southern hemisphere to win Winter Olympic gold. Inspiration generation . The 2012 London Olympics set out to inspire a generation, but it is arguably the Winter Games which are attracting a younger, hipper audience. ""The sports that have recently come into the Winter Olympics are the sports that young people are getting into,"" explains snowboarder Gillings, who says the majority of her fans tend to be between the ages of 12 and 20. ""Sports like snowboard cross, slopestyle and ski halfpipe are definitely the ones that young people are going to be watching."" The IOC, however, says that it does not have a demographic breakdown of its audience. The Putin Games . The Sochi Olympics have been dubbed the ""Putin Games"" -- and Russia's sport-loving President Vladimir Putin has staked his personal reputation on their success. Addressing the IOC in 2007 in support of Sochi's bid to become host, he said: ""It is a unique place. On the seashore you can enjoy a fine spring day. But up in the mountains it's winter. I went skiing there six or seven weeks ago, and I know."" Since winning the bid, $50 billion and rising has been splashed on Russia's first Winter Games, making them the most expensive Olympics in history. Putin has personally overseen the final preparations and in January he again went skiing in Sochi, although he didn't test out the Olympic courses. The 61-year-old, a keen horseman and judoka, also plays ice hockey and has tried his hand at bobsleigh. Surely the Winter Games are worth watching if only to see if Russia's president pops up as a surprise entry in one of the events? Snow language . If you fancy a Pop Tart, a McTwist or a Swiss Cheese Air should you head to one of Sochi's eateries or the snowboarding slopes? The Winter Olympics is a chance to limber up your alpine lexicon and impress your friends with tongue-twisting terminology. A guddle or a hog line might sound like something out of Harry Potter but they are actually Scottish-inspired curling terms, while ice dancing carries the threat of death spirals, camel spins and shooting the duck. Winter warmer . If you still need convincing to watch this month's Winter Olympics, then will the chance to feel warm and fuzzy do the trick? While the alpine stars brave frozen slopes and numbing ice, why not throw another log on the fire, stir another hot chocolate, fill a hot water bottle and feel nice and snug -- and a little smug -- as you watch their sporting feats from the comfort of your sofa.","The 2014 Winter Olympics takes place in the Russian resort of Sochi on 7-23 February .

"Beijing (CNN) -- An unspecified threat forced a New York-bound Air China flight to return to Beijing on Wednesday seven hours after takeoff, the airline said. ""Due to threatening information received about flight CA 981, to ensure the safety of passengers, this flight has returned to Beijing Capital International Airport,"" the Chinese flag carrier said in a terse statement posted online. The flight took off at 1:30 p.m. (1:30 a.m. ET) Wednesday and was scheduled to land at John. F. Kennedy International Airport in New York at 2:20 p.m. the same day. Instead, it turned around midair and returned to Beijing at 8:26 p.m. Wednesday, according to the airline's website. Police were called in to investigate but found nothing suspicious, the airport authority said in statements posted online. State media also quoted police as saying the initial warning of the threat came from U.S. authorities. The flight took off again at 12:31 a.m. Thursday and is expected to arrive in New York at 12:45 a.m. the same day, according to the airline's website. Beijing-based Air China did not reveal the nature of the threat or the number of passengers and crew members on board its Boeing 747 jumbo jet. The aircraft seats up to 344 passengers in the carrier's configuration, and it is peak travel season between China and the United States. Messages and photos posted on Chinese social-media sites showed passengers and their luggage being rescreened at the airport upon landing. One passenger, whose online handle is Kejiwaijiao, said he noticed something was wrong when the flight map on board indicated the plane was headed back to Beijing. When he inquired, he said, flight attendants told him it was a map display error. ""The captain notified us (of the reason) after we safely landed,"" he wrote on Sina Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter. Another passenger, whose Weibo name is Nataliebu, said crew members only told passengers to buckle up and sit tight due to strong air turbulence. On June 29, passengers and crew members thwarted a hijack attempt on a short-haul flight within the far western Chinese province of Xinjiang. Authorities said six ethnic Uyghur men tried to take control of the plane through violence before being subdued. The plane returned to its origin safely.

"(CNN) -- Keeping up with the changes in coaching personnel on the men's tennis tour can be difficult these days. Just ask Goran Ivanisevic. ""When I came into the locker room, I see the guys,"" explains the 2001 Wimbledon champion. ""I thought I might be mistaken. Are we on the Champions Tour?!"" The Croat's tongue-in-cheek remark made at the start of the Australian Open serves to illustrate a novel situation where former grand slam winners are suddenly all the rage with today's top players. Ivanisevic -- coach to compatriot Marin Cilic since 2010 -- and Ivan Lendl (who has been with Andy Murray since 2011) are old hands compared to the likes of Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg, who surprised everyone at the end of last year when they accepted roles with Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer respectively. The German and the Swede met 35 times in the 1980s and 1990s, famously contesting three consecutive Wimbledon finals. Edberg won that particular battle 2-1 with both men finishing their careers with six grand slam titles. But how will they fair as coaches? Pat Cash, a former rival of both and host of CNN's Open Court, admitted to ""surprise and disbelief"" when he got wind of Becker's appointment. He wasn't the only one. ""When Novak announced that Boris was going to be working with him I was honestly very surprised for a couple of reasons,"" two-time U.S. Open champion Tracy Austin told CNN. ""Novak had such a strong fall -- he was undefeated since the final of the U.S. Open where he lost to Rafael Nadal. He was 24-0 in the fall, so he was playing so well,"" she added. ""The other thing that came to mind was that I was surprised Boris wanted to do it. He seems to have such a full life with family and commentary. It's a big commitment to travel on tour with a player full-time. But it seems like Boris is really, really excited about doing it."" Excited and confident, judging by his comments prior to the Australian Open. ""I've been in 10 grand slam finals, I know exactly what a player feels like when he's in the later stages of a tournament,"" Becker told reporters. ""When you're 25 -- in my case -- I was better with a tennis racket and now I'm better with my mouth."" Net gains . Djokovic has retained the services of long-time coach Marian Vajda, but will be hoping to learn from Becker's much feted skills at the net, Austin thinks. It was here, after all, that the German made a name for himself during a 15-year career, winning thousands of points and millions of fans with his unique brand of athleticism and never-say-die attitude. ""(Djokovic) already has that from the baseline -- great defense, great offense -- but maybe he wants to round out his game a little bit more and be more forceful at the net, maybe have some better technique at the net,"" she says. Retired doubles ace Mark Woodforde is more familiar than most with Djokovic's game. The Australian, who won 11 grand slam doubles titles with his partner Todd Woodbridge, coached the world No. 2 for a time in 2007. ""He likes to evolve his game and take advice from great tennis players and obviously he's gone for one of the all-time greats in Boris Becker,"" Woodforde said. ""I just wonder whether in the back of Novak's mind is the way Boris played -- trying to finish points a little more cleanly than what he's been doing in the past. ""Maybe he's trying to pick up on the style that Boris brought to the court himself -- the knowledge, the hustle bustle. You've got to think that the elongated points that he has to play these days, it's got to mount up."" Long points inevitably lead to long games, as Djokovic's fans in Melbourne are all too aware. In 2012 he clinched his third title beating Rafael Nadal in a match lasting five hours 53 minutes -- the longest grand slam final ever -- and last year he took just over five hours to get past Stanislas Wawrinka in the fourth round. However, the Serbian's three-year Australian Open reign came to an end against Wawrinka on Tuesday as the Swiss upset the odds to win a grueling four-hour clash and reach the semifinals. While Djokovic tries to transition from baseline to net, Becker is plotting an entirely new path away from the commentary box. The 46-year-old has reigned in his TV duties since accepting the coaching role, but his former Davis Cup coach Niki Pilic has urged Becker, whose private life since retiring in 1999 has been colorful and, at times, scandalous, to go a step further. ""There is no doubt he needs to change his lifestyle completely,"" Pilic said, Reuters reported. ""He needs strict discipline and a certain modesty. It won't be easy for him but he has no choice. ""He should not give too many interviews, must be restrained and do his work quietly. Above all, he must understand that he is not more important than the player. It will be an interesting experiment."" Can Ed help Fed? Whereas Becker and Djokovic's partnership has caused a degree of head-scratching, the news that Federer had sought out the services of Edberg was much easier to understand. ""That one didn't surprise me,"" says Austin. ""He looks up to Stefan. He was one of his idols. Roger, when he first came on tour, to me, would serve and volley and infrequently chip and charge, and now he doesn't do that as much. Of course, that was Edberg's style of play, so maybe he's looking for that little extra element to elevate his game."" Edberg, now 48, has agreed to a part-time coaching role, spending 10 weeks with Federer this season, but is confident he can help the 32-year-old Swiss to an 18th grand slam title. ""He's such a great player, but there's always minor things you can work on,"" Edberg said recently. ""That's why I do it, because I really think I can make a little difference. And if I can make a little difference, maybe that will take him back to where he was."" Woodforde is relishing the prospect of watching the partnership evolve. ""We all liked to watch Stefan Edberg play. It's almost when we watch Roger play now, everyone covets to see him. They always want him to win,"" Woodforde said. ""I'm looking forward to seeing how Federer profits from that. I think it's going to be so beneficial for him because that is probably that style is probably what Roger needs to move towards if he is going to have an elongated career."" Fine margins . With the business end of the year's first grand slam approaching, Federer will hope he can execute the strategies discussed with Edberg as he takes on Andy Murray -- his successor as Wimbledon champion last year -- in Wednesday's quarterfinals. ""The key thing for me is that this really shows how important these tiny little things can make,"" says Austin. ""These are all champions that we are talking about, they're already top players, but they are looking for any different margin to set themselves apart. ""In a match when they are playing against each other, it could be two or three points. It could be something that a former champion says -- the light bulb goes and maybe makes them feel more comfortable, more confident. If that makes the difference then it's all worth it.""

"MANCHESTER, New Hampshire (CNN) -- On the eve of the New Hampshire primary, Sen. Barack Obama has a nine-point lead over Sen. Hillary Clinton in the state, according to a CNN-WMUR poll out Monday. Obama, the first-term senator from Illinois who won last week's Iowa caucuses, led the New York senator and former first lady 39 percent to 30 percent in a poll conducted Saturday through Sunday evening -- a sharp change from a poll out Saturday that showed the Democratic front-runners tied at 33 percent. Preliminary results from the poll released Sunday night showed Obama with a lead of 10 percentage points. Support for former Sen. John Edwards, who edged out Clinton for second place in Iowa, dropped from 20 percent in Saturday's poll to 16 percent. New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson ranked fourth among the Democratic contenders with 7 percent, while Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich trailed at 1 percent. Former Alaska Sen. Mike Gravel had less than one half of 1 percent support. ""The Iowa caucus results have convinced growing numbers of Granite State voters that Obama can really go all the way,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. ""In December, 45 percent thought Clinton had the best chance of beating the GOP nominee. But in Saturday's poll, Clinton and Obama were tied on that measure, and now Obama has a 42 percent to 31 percent edge over Clinton on electability."" The CNN/WMUR polls is consistent with six other non-partisan polls taken since the Iowa caucuses. All seven polls show Obama leading Clinton by margins ranging from 1 to 13 points -- with the average Obama lead at 7 points. All the polls show Edwards in third place. The CNN/WMUR polls ""strongly suggests an Obama surge in New Hampshire,"" CNN Senior Political Analyst Bill Schneider said. So is it all over? Not necessarily, according to Schneider.  ""The CNN poll shows Obama and Clinton nearly tied among registered Democrats. Obama's lead is coming from independents,"" he said. Obama's success depends on whether independents turn out in large numbers on Tuesday and vote in the Democratic rather than Republican primary, according to Schneider. On the Republican side, Sen. John McCain leads former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney by a narrower margin -- 31 percent to 26 percent, the survey found. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee -- whose upset win in Iowa came after being outspent by millions of dollars by Romney -- passed former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani to gain third place. Watch Candy Crowley explain the high stakes in New Hampshire » . In Saturday's poll, Giuliani had 14 percent and Huckabee had 11 percent. In Monday's poll, Huckabee had the support of 13 percent, while Giuliani had 10 percent. The results suggest that Huckabee's win in Iowa, which saw him win strong support among evangelical Christian voters, is giving him momentum in more secular, libertarian-oriented New Hampshire, CNN Political Analyst Bill Schneider said. Among other Republicans, anti-war Texas congressman and onetime Libertarian Party presidential nominee Ron Paul was in fifth place at 10 percent in the poll, with Rep. Duncan Hunter of California and former Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee both at 1 percent. The poll, conducted by the University of New Hampshire, surveyed 599 likely Democrats and 492 Republicans likely to vote in Tuesday's primary. It had a sampling error of 4 percentage points. Crucial to the outcome in New Hampshire are the state's independent voters, who make up around 40 percent of the electorate, and who can vote in either party's primary. With time running out, 6 percent of likely Democratic primary voters and 5 percent of those likely to vote in the GOP primary remain undecided. The poll indicates that a growing number of registered independents say they will vote in the GOP contest, which is a switch from just a month ago. Whether independents decide to vote in the Democratic or Republican primaries could affect the outcome of both races, Schneider said, noting that McCain ties Romney among registered Republicans but has an 11-point lead when independent voters are included. ""So McCain is not just running against Romney. He's also running against Obama for independent support."" Obama appears to be pulling even with Clinton among women, a voting bloc that she once dominated in the polls. And when asked which candidate has the best chance of beating the Republican presidential nominee, likely Democratic primary voters now choose Obama over Clinton 42 percent to 31 percent. That's a dramatic reversal from the last CNN/WMUR New Hampshire poll taken after Christmas and just before the Iowa caucuses, when Clinton beat Obama in electability by a two to one margin.

"(CNN) -- At least six people have been killed in avalanches recently in the West, as the risk of snow slides remains high. Two people were killed in each of three states: Oregon, Utah and Colorado. In Oregon, two cross-country skiers were killed Tuesday in an avalanche about 10 miles northwest of Halfway, according to the Baker County Sheriff's Office. Eight people were in their party when the snow slide hit. Besides those killed, two people were seriously injured and four escaped unharmed. The skiers were from the Seattle area and on a guided, multiday trip. In Utah, a snowmobiler and a snowshoer were killed in separate incidents over the weekend, the Utah Avalanche Center said. And in Colorado, two people were buried by large avalanches, again in separate events. One was caught by a snow slide near Kebler Pass; the other south of the Keystone Ski Area, according to the Colorado Avalanche Information Center. The center has issued an advisory warning that avalanche conditions in the backcountry remain dangerous. ""Cautious route-finding and conservative decision-making are essential. Travel in or below avalanche terrain is not recommended,"" it said. ""Veteran snow professionals are reporting triggered avalanches in well-documented avalanche paths that are breaking mature timber and behaving in surprising ways."" A 28-year-old man was buried by a triggered avalanche in northern Utah on Tuesday, the state's Avalanche Center said.

"(CNN) -- Construction crews began working on nearby tent cabins in Curry Village not long after Jenna Beck and her family arrived at Yosemite National Park. Beck had reserved seven nights in one of the park's 91 ""signature tent cabins,"" now at the epicenter of a hantavirus investigation. Eight visitors to the park have contracted hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, and three of them have died. Officials on Thursday confirmed that someone who stayed in another part of Yosemite contracted hantavirus. When campers checked out, crews moved in, spraying the tent cabins with bleach, replacing canvas and insulation, and hammering in new boards, Beck said. Curious about what was going on, she asked a crew member whether it was annual maintenance. The worker said they were dealing with a mice problem. ""When we checked in, nothing was said to us,"" said Beck, who got to the park August 18. ""We had no clue that anything was going on. There was no word to us, nothing about a rare and deadly disease."" Scott Gediman, spokesman for Yosemite National Park, said the California Department of Public Health issued a news release August 16. He said park officials were handing out fliers and fact sheets to park visitors and had the notices at the front desk. ""We certainly had an extensive outreach effort, but I can't guarantee that every person was contacted during that week,"" Gediman said. Beck, 38, said she and her boyfriend, David Sotar, 40, did not find out about the hantavirus investigation until August 24, when they found a note on their cabin that said they needed to be immediately relocated. When she went to the registration desk to find out what was going on, she was told about the hantavirus cases and given a pamphlet about the virus. She was livid. ""I'm worried. We've been taking a lot of vitamins and have been watching each other,"" Beck said. ""The minute anybody exhibits any flu-like symptoms, we're going straight to the doctor."" Gediman said that the situation was fluid and that officials inspected, cleaned and disinfected the cabins to make sure they were as rodent-proof as possible. Delaware North Company, the park's primary concessioner, hired a private contractor to retrofit the cabins and eliminate any gaps between the canvas and the wood where rodents could get in. ""We were very transparent up front,"" Gediman said. Officials closed the cabins in late August, and they are closed indefinitely. The situation has proved unsettling for Beck's mother, Mary Kay Beck, who accompanied her daughter, her grandson and Sotar to Yosemite. She sat reading her book while the crews worked. At one point, she saw workers remove insulation from a tent nearby that an animal had shredded. The bottom of it was discolored by urine and had droppings. Although Beck is concerned about potential exposure and is unhappy with the way the situation was handled, she and other campers said the hantavirus cases will not deter them from future vacations in Yosemite or from camping elsewhere. ""Will I camp again? Absolutely, yes, I will go camping again,"" Beck said, adding that Yosemite is one of her favorite places. ""That was not camping. That was staying in a crummy tent that was a public health risk, a public health nightmare."" Raquel Garcia, 38, of Fullerton, California, went to Yosemite in early August with relatives. The group rented four tent cabins in Curry Village but did not stay in the signature tent cabins. Garcia isn't worried. She already has reservations to stay in the same place next year. ""Are you going to live your entire life in a bubble because you are afraid you are going to be exposed to something? You just try to make the best choices you can for your family,"" she said. ""I don't feel like enjoying nature like that is putting them at risk."" Kevin Battey, 31, of Riverside, California, is a frequent camper. Many wild animals are carriers of disease, he said, and there are always risks when you stay outdoors. Battey stayed in the Upper Pines campground in Yosemite in early June and proposed to his girlfriend on the top of Half Dome. ""I think it could happen anywhere,"" he said. ""It's just something to think about whenever you go camping."" Health officials have sent warnings about the hantavirus cases to park visitors from 39 other countries. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that up to 10,000 people could be at risk. Yosemite, which receives about 4 million visitors a year, has been contacting people who stayed in the signature tent cabins between mid-June and the end of August. Seven of the eight people who contracted the virus stayed in those cabins. The eighth person stayed in multiple High Sierra Camps in Yosemite in July, the California Department of Public Health said Thursday. That visitor had mild symptoms and is recovering. Six of the people who contracted the virus are from California. One visitor is from Pennsylvania and the other is from West Virginia. Officials are advising anyone with hantavirus symptoms to seek immediate medical attention. Rare but serious, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is caused by a virus that people get through contact with the urine, droppings or saliva of infected rodents, primarily deer mice. In California, the deer mouse is the only carrier of hantavirus, and about 14% of mice in the state carry the disease, according to the National Park Service. Symptoms appear one to six weeks after exposure and may mimic a cold or the flu. Symptoms include fever, chills, headaches, gastrointestinal problems, muscle aches and fatigue. It is not contagious from person to person. What you need to know about hantavirus . People have contracted hantavirus while camping before, said Brian L. Hjelle, a medical doctor and a professor at the University of New Mexico's Health Science Center in Albuquerque. Hjelle, who has worked extensively on hantavirus, said a man camping on the floor of the Grand Canyon contracted the virus after a mouse ran across his face. ""It does happen, but probably the risk to any individual person is pretty low,"" he said. In general, the virus requires an active infestation; many people who have contracted the virus have reported seeing live or dead mice. Hjelle said he wouldn't be surprised if there were previous cases of hantavirus connected to Yosemite that hadn't been tracked back to the park. Before this year, Yosemite National Park had one hantavirus case in 2000 and one in 2010. ""I think that they probably are going to need to look at their practices more carefully in that particular site,"" Hjelle said. Even though campers are warned to protect food from bears, there is no doubt a lot of food in the area, which can attract mice. ""You can't have that many visitors packed in that tight with food,"" he said. ""It might not be possible to do what they are doing (at Curry Village) in the long-term.""","CDC officials have said that up to 10,000 people could be at risk for hantavirus .

"(CNN) -- We all feel like hibernating this winter. The arctic chill has us huddled together with our dogs, cats and humans on sofas across the land, venturing out only for that required dog walk. Yet the brisk air is invigorating for some living things â€” maybe even you. So, party with your dog, toast the ugliest fish in the world or walk into the wilderness to spot bald eagles or elk. Here are 10 animal-focused ideas for winter: . A cold water plunge for your pooch . Dogs and humans alike get to dive into the Atlantic Ocean during the Polar Plunge Festival on the Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, boardwalk (January 31-February 2). Don't worry: leashed pooches only go into the water as much as they like. The $25 pooch registration fee includes an official Pooch Plunge dog bandana. This Special Olympics fundraiser also includes a 5K Run to the Plunge and an ice sculpting demonstration. Run those huskies into the woods . For a more active experience with dogs born to run, head to Maine for your introduction to dogsledding. No matter that you've never raced in the Alaskan Iditarod. Even kids can take charge of the dogs during these February half-day adventures into the Maine wilderness, which includes meeting the huskies, a 15- to 25-mile mush and a midday stop to build a fire and feed the dogs. There are also full-day and even two-day programs. Half-day prices start at $400 for a group of up to four people. This dog race really counts . Want to see the real deal? This Valentine's Day weekend, come to Helena, Montana, for the Race to the Sky qualifying race for the Alaskan Iditarod. The 350-mile adult race starts at Camp Rimini, where soldiers and sled dogs trained during World War II and winds through the state's Rocky Mountains. There's also a 100-mile adult race and a 100-mile junior race. One of the nonprofit organizer's missions this year is to assist groups working to bring retired military dogs home. The host town of Helena also turns 150 years old this year, so it's bound to be an even bigger party than usual. The ugliest fish in the world . One of the ugliest bottom-dwelling fish known to humans, the eelpout, gets its own festival in the tiny town of Walker, Minnesota, population 1,500. Even the name of the lake -- Leech -- is ugly. But that doesn't stop more than 10,000 festival participants and visitors from filling the town from February 20-23 for the 2014 International Eelpout Festival. Come for the Eelpout Fishfry and stay for the Eelpout Curling, the EelPout 500 races or the fishing show. A more refined animal spotting . Get up early to see elk in their natural habitat near Buckhorn Lake State Resort Park, Kentucky. The tour leaves the resort for the elk reserve around 5:30 a.m., and guests should bring snacks, cameras and binoculars to capture their elk. The tour returns to the resort by noon. Head to the resort park the night before to stay the night and attend a pre-tour natural history program. The package price of $90 per single or $120 per couple includes one night's room, continental breakfast and transportation to and from the elk preserve the next morning. The tour is available February 1, 2, 22 and 23. The national bird soars across many states . The American bald eagle, the official bird emblem of the United States, loves to spend the winter in some pretty cold states. If you're in the middle of the country, head to Oklahoma's Sequoyah National Wildlife Refuge to spot the mighty bird or Beavers Bend State Park to find bald eagles hunting for food, fishing or nesting. (There are sometimes tours.) In Connecticut, join the state Audubon Society for an eagle-spotting cruise. In the upper Midwest, spot bald eagles soaring over several Illinois towns. A banner year for this Arctic Circle resident . We're not promising that you'll spot the Snowy Owl at Norman Bird Sanctuary in Rhode Island. But it's worth a try this February to find the elusive Arctic Circle bird, which has been traveling south in unusually high numbers this winter. Bring your own binoculars to the sanctuary's free guided bird walks on February 2 and February 16. We hear from Rhode Island officials that it could be a banner year for sightings. Alaskan animals come out to play . Moose, wolves and caribou don't sleep through Alaska's long, cold and dark winter, and animal spotters have a special treat this year: The National Park Service will plow the Denali National Park & Preserve road west of park headquarters in mid-February, a month earlier than usual (and the earliest it's ever been opened) so winter sports enthusiasts can play in the snow. Party with the community surrounding the park at Winterfest (February 21-23). Groundhog Day predicts the end of winter . Want to know when winter will finally end? Join the crowds on the walk to Gobbler's Knob to spot the most anticipated winter animal of all, Punxsutawney Phil. He's expected to appear early on February 2, Groundhog Day, to let the world know how much more winter we can expect. The festival marking his appearance includes breakfast with Phil and s'mores with the Inner Circle, the local dignitaries who plan Groundhog Day events and care for Phil. Saddle up for the rodeo . You say you're done with winter and prefer warm-weather activity? It can be a tad warmer in San Antonio where the San Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo (February 6-23) hosts horse and livestock shows, auctions and sales of horses and other livestock, rodeo performances, exhibits, a carnival and concerts after the show. The heat is on!","Practice the art of dogsledding in the Maine woods .

"(CNN) -- This year in TV was all about having what you wanted when you wanted it. Some TV viewers binged on hours upon hours of shows, while others were simply more selective with what they viewed. Whether it was content saved on a DVR or streaming services like Netflix and Amazon, viewers spent plenty of time growing fat on the lamb that was this year in TV. With so much technology, viewers almost didn't need to actually sit in front of a TV in order to enjoy TV in 2013. ""Television is becoming ever less about the box in the corner of the room, and ever more about the content it gives you access to,"" according to 33 Digital & Hotwire's Digital Trends Report 2013. Such indulgence meant 2013 was also the year that Netflix became a source for major networks to contend with. Don't believe that? Check the awards shows. Netflix has garnered six Golden Globe nominations, placing them ahead of broadcast television networks CBS, NBC (which each had five nominations) and ABC (which had four). Netflix's ""House of Cards"" starring Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright snagged the most with four nominations, while their other hit series ""Orange is the New Black"" and the revived ""Arrested Development"" each received one nomination. Netflix also made history in September by winning three Emmys. Not bad for a company that only a few years ago was competing with the now defunct Blockbuster in getting DVDs into the hands of customers. While streaming and DVRing shows is not new, the take off of the original content really came into its own in 2013. Charlotte Koh, head of content development for Hulu Originals, said she sees it as a natural progression as consumers become more comfortable ""living online."" ""What's been great for all the online, on-demand distributors of content is that people really start to think about a place where we have first-window content that hasn't been anywhere else,"" Koh said. ""I think it's a great virtuous circle that makes people more curious about 'Hey, I can discover things that I like here in this world that isn't necessarily available for me through traditional networks.'"" Hulu's most successful first-run series, ""Misfits,"" returned this fall for its fifth and final season, and the company announced its first co-production with Lionsgate, ""Deadbeat,"" a supernatural comedy starring Cat Deeley and Tyler Labine, as well as second seasons of the animated series ""The Awesomes"" from ""Saturday Night Live"" star Seth Myers and the western procedural comedy ""Quick Draw."" Koh, whose company partners with network TV to stream their series, said on-demand companies like hers help ""raise consumer awareness about shows that may need a little more time to gain a big audience."" ""Then that audience goes and finds that show on the network because they want to watch it live when an episode comes on,"" she said. ""Or they use us occasionally when they want to play catch up."" Amazon is also throwing its hat into the original content ring. In May the company announced that it would be creating five shows based on response from 14 pilots it posted online. ""Annebots,"" ""Alpha House,"" ""Betas,"" ""Creative Galaxy"" and ""Tumbleleaf"" have all gotten the green light. With so much available content, viewers now no longer have to patiently wait for a new TV series to gain traction. They can instead catch up on a show that is already popular or indulge in original programming from aggregators. CNN Money recently reported that the concept of ""binge watching"" may be changing. A Harris Interactive survey commissioned by Netflix found that those responding considered binge watching to be ""watching a handful of episodes (between 2-6 episodes) of the same TV show in one sitting."" Respondents also said they found binge watching an enjoyable activity. That is not at all to suggest that broadcast and cable are dead. To the contrary, 2013 found fans losing it over the series finale of AMC's ""Breaking Bad,"" enraptured by ""Game of Thrones'"" ""Red Wedding"" episode and fully embracing new shows like NBC's ""The Blacklist"" and Fox's ""Sleepy Hollow."" Staff writers at The Atlantic recently selected their favorite episodes of 2013 and they were as varied as episode seven of ""Arrested Development"" on Netflix to the ""You've Got Sext"" episode of Fox's ""The Mindy Project."" On the cable side, original programming including A&E's reality show ""Duck Dynasty"" and the History Channel's miniseries ""The Bible"" scored big ratings. In October, the Nielsens released its first ever ""Twitter ratings,"" which measures the amount of tweets about a show and the size of the audience that views them. For the week of September 23, ""Breaking Bad"" ranked No. 1 with 9.3 million unique users seeing tweets specific to that show. The increased focus on social and TV also grew in 2013, with Twitter announcing in November that it had updated its apps to allow for better organization of trending TV shows. That means it's now easier for ""Scandal"" fans to find each other and for viewers to ""hate tweet"" the live production of NBC's ""The Sound of Music,"" which they did in droves. Audiences definitely know what they want and Hulu's Koh said she see the challenge in both attracting and keeping viewers who are now completely used to having the power of on-demand. ""One of the things we work very hard at is being the perfect matchmaker between audience and show,"" she said. ""We work on what's the right strategy to reach those in the market place and break through all of the noise. What TV did you enjoy in 2013?

"(CNN) -- Capturing one of the world's most wanted criminals shows that Mexico's security strategy is working, the country's President said Monday. Technology and intelligence helped lead authorities to Sinaloa cartel boss Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman over the weekend, President Enrique Peña Nieto said at an event marking Flag Day in Mexico. ""The apprehension of one of the most wanted drug lords at the international level shows the effectiveness of the Mexican state, but in no way should it be a motive to fall into triumphalism,"" he said. ""On the contrary, this institutional accomplishment encourages us to move forward, working with passion and energy to demonstrate that, yes, it is possible to achieve a peaceful Mexico."" Peña Nieto praised collaborations between the military and different parts of Mexico's federal government. ""This detention reaffirms the commitment that the government has to employ all of its abilities in fighting organized crime,"" he said. When the 47-year-old won Mexico's 2012 presidential vote, critics expressed concerns that cracking down on organized crime wouldn't be a priority for his administration and suggested negotiating with drug cartels might be on the table once he took office. Peña Nieto said his goal was stopping drug violence by addressing the economic and social problems that fuel it. Since taking office in December 2012, Peña Nieto has talked about fighting cartels significantly less than his predecessor, Felipe Calderon. But Guzman's arrest Saturday was a sign that taking down drug lords is still on Mexico's a agenda.

"(CNN) -- Gail Devers is a three-time Olympic gold medalist in track and field. But when she was in college, a diagnosis of Graves' disease, an immune system disorder that results in the overproduction of thyroid hormones, posed one of her biggest hurdles. CNN: You were diagnosed with Graves' disease in 1990. What happened leading up to your diagnosis? Gail Devers: I was in college at UCLA. Things were going very well; I had set an American record. Then, all of sudden, within a month, in my recollection, things started to fall apart. My hair started falling out, and at that time, I had long hair. It was curly and doing its thing, and it started falling out. I had always had long nails unless I cut them; they started breaking. I couldn't figure out what was going on. The weirdest part for me was losing weight. My normal running weight at that time was between 119 and 120 (pounds). ... At my worst -- and I say at my worst because I stopped getting on the scale because I just couldn't stand the way I looked -- at my worst, I was under like 85 pounds. Then it was like, ""There is definitely something wrong."" I had made the 1988 Olympic team, and then the bottom fell out, is what I say. I couldn't run anywhere close to where I had ran just two months prior to that, so definitely there is a problem. When I got to the race in the 100-meter hurdles, I ran slower than the first time I ever ran when I ever stepped on the track. ... There were no answers for almost 2Â½ years, and it wasn't until 1990 (that I was diagnosed). I had even stopped going out of the house because I couldn't stand the way I looked. My face was breaking out; it had white or light spots all over. I had little to no hair, and nobody could tell me what was wrong. I love kids and remember being at an event outside a little park, and a little kid walked by with their mom and said, ""Mommy, what's wrong with her?"" That was the last time. I stopped going outside. I actually had covered up mirrors in my house because I didn't want to see myself. It wasn't a good time. CNN: What inspired you to make it through being sick and return to running? Devers: Although I got sidelined for three years, I figured ... I am going to figure this out go back out there. I still have that love and support from my coach and my family. ... (In) 1992, at the Olympic Games ... back then the heat of the race was lane 4, 5 and 6, so that lets you know what (was) thought about me in lane 2.

There is always something you gotta get over, and it's what you do, you know. Sometimes we fall, sometimes we stumble, but we can't stay down. We can't allow life to beat us down. Everything happens for a reason, and it builds character in us, and it tells us what we are about and how strong we really are when we didn't think we could be that strong. You have to get up. You have to keep going. You have to try harder, and if somebody else falls down, you have to pick them up and carry them with you. ... Life (is about) service and what can I do to help that next person who is struggling? What is it that happened to me in my life that I can share with somebody else, just to help them make it through? I am very thankful that I have lived the life I have lived. I am thankful for my Graves' disease, and I tell people, if I had my whole life to live over, I would have it, because it has really made me into the person that I am. I feel like I am stronger. There is nothing I don't feel like I can do if I try. ...

"(CNN) -- A reported arsonist on board an Etihad Airways flight is being blamed for an emergency landing. According to Etihad Airways, flight EY461 from Melbourne to Abu Dhabi had to make an emergency stop in Jakarta on Monday after smoke was detected in bathrooms mid-flight. ""It was very smoky, and it felt like the aircraft had filled with smoke,"" said passenger Sarah Jefferey, as reported by the Sydney Morning Herald. ""When smoke was detected in two of the toilets ... the captain decided to divert the aircraft as a precautionary measure and land in Jakarta in order to allow the authorities to assist him to conduct a security assessment of the situation,"" said the airline in a statement. After a search of the aircraft, passengers and carry-on luggage, the flight took off from Jakarta, continuing to Abu Dhabi. Etihad Airways, the national carrier of the United Arab Emirates, didn't say whether any passengers were removed from the flight in Jakarta. According to an updated statement from the airline, 12 passengers are being held by Abu Dhabi security authorities. No arrests have been made. More smoke . Despite strict controls over passenger movements instituted by the pilot, that wasn't the end of the smoking bathrooms. Yet another toilet smoke alarm went off two hours before arrival in Abu Dhabi. At this point, flight attendants ceased normal service to take up watch at each restroom and to monitor passenger access, said the airline. The plane landed in Abu Dhabi four hours behind schedule. No injuries were reported. First person account . While Etihad Airways' official statement made no mention of an arsonist -- simply noting that smoke had been detected on board -- several passengers say they were told upon landing in Jakarta that someone had started fires on the plane. Passenger Graham Foote, a singer traveling to Abu Dhabi for a performance, told CNN he became aware of the issue when cabin lights suddenly came on five hours into the flight. ""I looked at the inflight map and discovered that we were 90 minutes out from our destination, which seemed unusual given it's a 13-hour flight,"" said Foote. ""The captain then came over the intercom and announced that there had been a security breach and that we were diverting to Jakarta."" Other passengers say the reason for the diversion was explained to them only after landing in Jakarta. ""Upon arrival in Jakarta, we were told that a passenger had attempted to light two fires on the aircraft,"" said Foote. When more smoke began coming from the bathroom following the Jakarta takeoff, all semblance of normal service -- including food and drink service -- was abandoned. ""Approximately two hours (away) from Abu Dhabi, we were informed that the arsonist had made another attempt and that all service was to be suspended,"" said Foote. ""The cabin staff also further restricted bathroom access at this point, checking the trash and toilet after every passenger had been inside."" Suspects . While the Sydney Morning Herald reports that a female passenger is a suspect, Foote said that two men ""of Middle Eastern origin"" seemed to be the subjects of investigation and were detained by police upon arrival in Abu Dhabi. ""One of the guys had a very nervous demeanor and intermittently changed seats throughout the flight from directly in front of me to another vacant seat with his travel companion,"" said Foote. ""During the first flight, when he entered the bathroom about seven staff members were congregated around the area, two of whom held fire extinguishers."" Upon landing at Abu Dhabi Airport, all passengers and crew were interviewed by authorities. Etihad Airways has not commented on suspects, stating only that the event is still under investigation. Abu Dhabi police are also investigating the incident. Passengers have lauded the airline's crew for rising to the occasion. Passenger Paul Ross wrote to CNN praising the airplane crew's response. ""The crew on this flight should be highly commended,"" wrote Ross. ""They dealt with these incidents with complete professionalism. They ensured there was no panic and kept passengers on the plane calm and settled."" Foote called the crew's response ""extraordinary."" As for his own state of mind during the episode, Foote said that the flight felt ""so surreal it didn't really feel dangerous."" ""Like most passengers on board, my biggest reaction was frustration at the delay and anger toward the person or persons who were attempting to light the fire.""","Flight EY461 from Melbourne to Abu Dhabi made emergency landing in Jakarta .

"(CNN) -- There's a coming showdown between Democrats and Republicans on the issue of income inequality. President Obama has called it the ""defining issue of our time."" Progressives recognize that sustaining unemployment benefits, increasing the minimum wage and ensuring equal pay are key weapons. Republicans, who recently voted to leave 1.3 million Americans in the cold by not extending unemployment benefits, frame the inequality debate as yet another attempt to implement liberal, anti-free market, big-government giveaways. Americans know better. In a speech last week, GOP presidential hopeful Marco Rubio said federal money should be given to the states to figure out how to deal with poverty. He called for replacing the Earned Income Tax Credit with a subsidy to encourage people to take low-wage jobs, and for the federal government to encourage marriage. He called President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty a failure. But there is no question that without the War on Poverty, millions more would be in it today. Attempts to paint it any other way will backfire, as majorities of Americans support its policies. Republicans have a chance to show they are on the side of the American people in addressing poverty and inequality. America's women and children, in particular, are depending on them. In fact, 50 years after Johnson declared war on poverty, an astonishing new report by Maria Shriver paints a bleak picture of today's barren economic landscape for 42 million women and 28 million children. Shriver's father, Sargent Shriver, helped lead the Johnson administration's all-out campaign on behalf of the elderly, the hungry and vulnerable families and children. While facts show that without this effort many more Americans would be in poverty today, Maria Shriver's report, ""A Woman's Nation Pushes Back From the Brink,"" describes a much-changed nation in which poverty wears a different face. On the one hand, it is indisputable that women have made much progress. A majority of women are now family breadwinners, and they hold more college degrees than men. Women have also made gains in reaching the highest levels in business and politics. But these benchmarks mask a disturbing reality: Too many women are one missed paycheck, one illness, one hospital visit or car breakdown away from economic disaster. A recent best-seller urged career women to ""lean in"" to succeed in the workplace. The Shriver report underscores how many women lie awake at night worrying that they could fall out of the middle or working class and into the ranks of the poor. While many of us are pondering how to have it all, these strong women are doing it all, without having much. Shamefully, the richest country in the world does not invest enough to allow women to keep fueling America's economic growth while securing their own economic futures and those of their children. The report lists many reasons for this predicament -- the lack of well-paying jobs that offer upward mobility; the change in the family structure where majorities of low-income women, many of them single, are heads of households; and most importantly, the lack of good education. Those are the overarching realities, but there are many more subtle, hidden aspects of the economic landscape for women in America. One-third live in or on the brink of poverty. They struggle to get their children to school at 7 for breakfast, so they can take their mothers to medical appointments and still make it to work by 9. Forty-two million women represent two-thirds of minimum-wage workers in the country, and women still make just 77% of what men make. So what can be done? For starters, we can fix the wage discrepancy between men and women. This could cut the poverty rate in half for struggling working women and it would represent an economic stimulus of half a trillion dollars. The Shriver report also outlines a set of other public policy solutions, including raising the minimum wage for all and helping women access better paying jobs through job training. It describes how government support structures could allow for better and more affordable child care, enabling women to balance the roles of caregiver and breadwinner. And in a surprising revelation, it uncovers the regret many of these low-income women express about marrying early -- and also, in many cases, their satisfaction at having gotten divorced. Republican lectures about marriage and family values will not work to solve poverty. But making education and child care accessible, closing the wage gap and leveling the playing field will. Republicans should note that one of the studies in the Shriver report shows that women of color -- a key demographic with whom the party desperately needs to make inroads -- overwhelmingly believe government has a role to play in providing adaptive workplace structures and policies that support today's contemporary families. No, this is not a plea for a handout. These women, while in a more financially precarious position than their white counterparts, are also more optimistic about their futures. As in: I want to work hard and know there are better economic opportunities out there for me to succeed. These policy solutions the report offers are not new; progressives have been fighting for them for a very long time. But it also outlines what we can do as individuals, communities and corporations. We can, for example, help young girls make smarter choices, promote a ""college before kids"" mentality, and help businesses identify best practice policies that can better support low-wage women workers. So let's forgo the showdown. These are common-sense proposals that uphold mainstream principles of taking care of our families and children. They are not liberal, progressive or Democratic values. They are American values that will protect and secure the American dream for everyone once and for all. Americans expect our leaders from both parties to uphold them. Let's get to work. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Maria Cardona.","Maria Cardona: In parties' inequality debate, GOP has chance to show it gets it .
She says economy's failure to help Americans seen clearly in the lot of women,children .
She says women need equal wages, workplace policies that support women .

"(CNN) -- Australia has won the Ashes -- now it wants to rub salt in English wounds by pulling off a whitewash. Tuesday's victory in Perth gave Australia an unassailable 3-0 lead with two games remaining -- two games in which it will attempt to exact revenge on an England side which has dominated the Ashes in recent years. Having lost the previous three Ashes series, Australia was expected to put up a brave fight against an England side which triumphed 3-0 on home soil only a few months ago. Instead, it produced a performance full of courage, vigor and quality -- blowing England away with a level of cricket which simply proved too aggressive and intense for the touring side. Victory in Perth by 150 runs ensured the Ashes urn returned to Australia after a 1,577 day absence and left captain Michael Clarke with even more reason to celebrate his 100th Test match appearance. ""This is a special feeling,"" Clarke told reporters after sealing his first Ashes series win as skipper. ""You won't find one guy in the changing room, player or support staff, who won't say this is the pinnacle, playing Test cricket against England. ""I am going to enjoy 3-0 for as long as I can tonight. I am going to enjoy this feeling, but I can guarantee you there won't be any complacency. ""We will turn up in Melbourne 100% ready to go and be doing everything we have done in the first three Test matches."" Australia will now be aiming to produce a repeat of the 2006-7 series when it defeated England 5-0 in a humiliating whitewash. That defeat signaled a period of introspection into English cricket with the publication of the Schofield report -- a 19-step guide to improving the national team. Since then England has improved rapidly, winning three Ashes series in succession in 2009, 2010-11 and 2013. In August 2011 it became the top ranked side in Test match cricket -- but it has struggled since being replaced by South Africa at the summit in 2012. Its 2013 3-0 home victory over Australia was far from convincing with England's batsmen coming in for particular criticism. The team's failings, particularly with the bat, have been greatly exposed by an Australian side led by the fast bowling of Mitchell Johnson. Johnson has taken 23 wickets in the opening three Tests after failing to make the squad for the previous Ashes series. Only Ben Stokes, 22, has managed a century for the tourists in the opening three Test matches. England, which lost Jonathan Trott to a stress-related illness following the first Test defeat at Brisbane, has failed to reach 400 in a single innings since it faced New Zealand in Wellington in March 2013. Here, against a rampant Australian bowling attack, it wilted like the England teams of old, which were so often brushed aside. Needing an unlikely 506 in its second innings to win the contest at Perth's WACA stadium, it fell 150 runs short despite a magnificent 120 from newcomer Stokes. It means England will now head into the Boxing Day clash at the Melbourne Cricket Ground with only pride to play for. ""The simple fact of the matter is we haven't had enough players in form with either bat or ball,"" captain Alastair Cook told reporters. ""You can't put it any more honest than that, and people in the dressing room know that. ""It hurts like hell when you come into a contest and you end up being second best."" The two teams will meet in the fourth Test at the MCG on December 26 before moving on to Sydney for the final contest on Friday January 3.","Australia has won the Ashes following victory in Perth .

"(CNN) -- For a film about travel, ""Gringo Trails"" almost makes you never want to travel again. The 80-minute documentary by New York-based anthropologist Pegi Vail takes the pants off the tourism industry to expose the negative impact travelers have on the places they pass through. Vail filmed in numerous locations along the ""gringo trail,"" a series of hot spots around the world first explored by adventurous Western backpackers seeking the undiscovered and authentic -- the so-called ""hidden gem"" destinations. Inevitably, word gets out about these once little known places, and more backpackers descend. Close behind comes the whole gamut of the hospitality industry -- the hotels, booze, drugs and sex peddlers, multi-national tour operators, and the sirens of independent travel, guidebooks. Within a decade, places like Haad Rin beach in Thailand go from untouched haven to full-blown party destination visited by tens of thousands of hedonists. Uncontrolled development overwhelms the environment and crushes local culture. Window seat -- but you may not like the view . For those who love to travel, ""Gringo Trails"" is a bucket of ice water in the face. It forces us to confront the consequences of tourism and how travelers have a long-term effect on the places that they visit. Why am I traveling? Why do I want to go where I'm going? Where are my tourist dollars heading and what else am I giving to a place? These are the questions ""Gringo Trails"" asks and, as importantly, wants us to ask of ourselves. As such, it's a neat little Backpacker 101. A moving essay with a broad scope, it takes us on an intrepid guilt trip around the world, from Haad Rin to Timbuktu to Bolivia's Isla Incahuasi to Bhutan. For those who have read up on the problems of introducing tourism to developing countries, ""Gringo Trails"" won't offer anything new, but it brings vague notions to life through dramatic images, sometimes beautiful, most times appalling. Hodgepodge technique distracting . ""Gringo Trails"" is inconsistent in style and quality. Some shots are slick and well-produced -- an opening sequence featuring a continuous aerial shot over the Bolivian jungle sets up a glamorous big-budget feel. Other scenes have a low-def, hand-held quality, which adds immediacy but can be annoying. Vail began filming in 1999, picking up new filmmaking skills (and likely more budget) along the way. The hodgepodge approach shows. Adding to the confusion are humorous anecdotes that pepper the film. Standing in front of large maps, travel professionals speak directly to the camera in aggressively chirpy tones, like friends recounting travel stories to each other at the bar. It's a jocular, reality-TV style that clashes with the heavy subject matter and creates emotional speed bumps in an otherwise somber film hurtling toward ever more bleak examples of irresponsible tourism. One of the primary narratives is set in Bolivia, where the tale of Yossi Ghinsberg, a backpacker who got lost in the Bolivian jungle in 1981 and survived for weeks before being rescued, has attracted a tribe of thrill seeking travelers. Ghinsberg eventually returned to Bolivia to help set up the Chalalan Ecolodge, a project now owned and operated by the Bolivians that helped to rescue him. The film concludes with a vignette about the Chalalan Ecolodge project. It's an optimistic note -- a traveler who harnesses the power he has over a destination and its people -- that serves as a great argument for responsible travel. There may be no singular, fool-proof formula for how a nation should develop its tourism industry, but Vail's film should get us talking about the many possibilities. ""Gringo Trails"" was released through Icarus Films and is now showing on the global film festival circuit. Upcoming screenings: Environmental Film Festival, in Washington, D.C., March 19; Sebastopol Documentary Festival, in California, March 29 .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona's season has turned upside down after the club's first home league defeat in 25 matches, says ""concerned"" coach Gerardo Martinez. The Spanish champions face the prospect of losing the outright lead after a record 59-game run at the top following Saturday's shock 3-2 defeat by Valencia, in which key defender Jordi Alba was sent off against his former team. It left Barca level on points with second-placed Atletico Madrid, which hosts fourth-placed Real Sociedad on Sunday. Longtime rival Real Madrid, meanwhile, can move two points above the Catalan team with victory at sixth-placed Athletic Bilbao. ""Now we're playing in a completely different competition,"" Martino said on Barca's website. ""We will try to regain the ground that we will most likely lose this weekend. We still have to play against our direct rivals. ""I'm concerned and I want to bounce back from this as soon as possible."" Barcelona led through Alexis Sanchez but Daniel Parejo and Pablo Piatti put midtable Valencia head with goals either side of halftime. Lionel Messi leveled with his first La Liga goal in four months when a penalty was awarded despite the ball appearing to hit Ricardo Costa in the shoulder, not his arm, but Francisco Alcacer restored the lead in the 59th minute before fullback Alba collected his second booking. It was Barca's first league defeat at Camp Nou since April 2012, and only second in 22 league matches this season, leaving Martinez disconsolate. ""We had the impression that the match was over after half an hour and we paid for that. I said that we will pay for our errors, and we committed errors today,"" said the Argentine, in his first season in charge. ""Any error from now on out could cost us dearly. Their goal at the end of the first half hurt us and we lost confidence. Their second goal made us desperate."" Barca will next play seventh-placed Sevilla, which conceded two late goals in a 3-2 defeat that eased Malaga's relegation fears. Former Portugal winger Duda scored the winning home side's first from the penalty and then the 83rd-minute decider. In Saturday's other games, there were 0-0 draws in the games between Levante and Rayo Vallecano, and Getafe vs. Valladolid -- which left all four clubs in the bottom half of the table. In Italy, fourth-placed Fiorentina will likely lose ground on the top Serie A teams following a 1-0 defeat at Cagliari. Leader Juventus plays fifth-placed Inter Milan on Sunday, while closest rival Roma hosts Parma and Napoli travels to Atalanta. Ninth-placed AC Milan came from behind to draw 1-1 at home to fellow Europa League qualification hopeful Torino as loan defender Adil Rami equalized, a result which ended new coach Clarence Seedorf's run of two successive wins. Meanwhile, Udinese moved away from the relegation zone with a 2-0 win at Bologna. In Germany, second-placed Bayer Leverkusen ended a run of three losses by beating Stuttgart 2-1 at home. Switzerland international striker Eren Derdiyok headed a late winner as Leverkusen closed to within 10 points of leader Bayern Munich, which hosts Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday. Leverkusen moved four points ahead of third-placed Borussia Dortmund, which won 2-1 at bottom club Eintracht Braunschweig on Friday. Schalke moved up to fourth after beating 10-man Wolfsburg 2-1 with a late winner from midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng, while Borussia Monchengladbach dropped to fifth following a 3-1 loss at Hannover. In France, second-placed Monaco could only draw 2-2 at Lorient -- meaning next weekend's top-of-the-table clash with Paris Saint-Germain becomes even more important. Champions PSG hold a five-point advantage following Friday's 2-0 win at home to Bordeaux, and it could have been even more if Layvin Kurzawa had not scored a late leveler for Monaco.","Coach Gerardo Martino admits ""concern"" following end of Barcelona's unbeaten home run .

"(CNN) -- For much of the world, February 14 is known as a day to celebrate love. But in Iran, Valentine's Day has come to mark another occasion as well—the anniversary of the house arrest of Iran's leading opposition figures Mir Hossein Mousavi, Mehdi Karroubi and Zahra Rahnavard. On February 14, 2011, Iranian authorities placed Mousavi, Karroubi and Rahnavard under house arrest for calling on Iranians to demonstrate in support of the popular Arab uprisings across the region. According to Reuters, earlier this month Karroubi was moved from a Ministry of Intelligence-controlled safe house to his own home. The transfer shined new light on the plight of Iran's ""prisoners of rights""— those imprisoned for seeking to exercise commonly recognized political, social, religious, economic, and cultural rights, denied to them by the Iranian government. In addition to opposition politicians like Mousavi, Karroubi and Rahnavard, Iran's prisoners of rights include lawyers, journalists, professors, students, labor union workers, poets, musicians, artists, dissident clerics, bloggers, ethnic and religious minorities, LGBT persons and even humanitarian aid workers. Civil rights and human rights activists are also a primary target. Some prisoners of rights, like women's rights and student activist Bahareh Hedayat, have been arrested for holding gatherings to protest laws that discriminate against women. Others, like the ""Yaran""—the seven leaders of the Bahá'í religious minority in Iran—are imprisoned for teaching a faith the Iranian government does not recognize. Still others, like lawyer Abdolfattah Soltani, are imprisoned for their efforts to assist or seek justice for prisoners of rights. Ironically, before his arrest, Soltani had been preparing a case in defense of the seven Bahá'í leaders. The easing of restrictions on Karroubi's house arrest will be of key interest to observers tracking President Hassan Rouhani's delivery on promises he made on the campaign trail in last June's presidential election. While Rouhani made no express promise to free Iran's prisoners of rights, his references to the jailed opposition leaders and pledge to increase civil and cultural freedoms resonated strongly with voters. The release of renowned human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and other high profile activists last September in advance of President Rouhani's first-ever address to the UN General Assembly buoyed hopes of more releases. And a subsequent announcement by the Iranian judiciary that 80 more political prisoners had been pardoned further stoked expectations. Unfortunately, these hopes have gone largely unrealized. According to human rights groups, only half of the 80 promised pardons can be confirmed. Many of those released had already served their terms. Since the announcement, arrests have continued—including the arrest of a popular rapper and more than a dozen ""cyberactivists."" There is some indication that Iran's Judiciary may be driving human rights abuses during President Rouhani's first six months in office—perhaps in an effort to undermine reforms. Indeed, while significant gains have been made through international diplomacy on the nuclear issue during President Rouhani's tenure, advancement on human rights has come to a standstill. This despite a recent poll that shows democracy, civil rights and women's rights top the list of priorities for the Iranian people. Regardless of whom in Iran's complicated governance structure is at fault, one thing is clear: the international community's engagement on human rights, alongside resolution of the nuclear issue and the easing of sanctions, remains a necessary factor for progress. Each visit to Tehran, each promise of renewed investment, each round of nuclear negotiations brings a fresh opportunity for global decision makers and influencers to press human rights concerns. These openings should not be squandered. Another opportunity will present itself when the P5+1 powers reconvene in New York City this month. Although by definition the focus of the talks will remain on the nuclear issue, geo-strategic concerns will likely be raised. Alongside those concerns, every effort should be made to incorporate discussion of Iran's human rights situation into the conversation. Finally, all of these governments will convene again in March for the UN Human Rights Council's 25th session in Geneva. They should take the opportunity to recommit themselves to the human rights cause by adopting a resolution renewing the mandate of the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran and allowing him to visit the country. The resolution should also set specific benchmarks for the Iranian government including the release of all prisoners of conscience, a moratorium on executions, and an end to restrictions on assembly, association, and expression. Recently developed bilateral and multilateral channels between Iran and global powers, including the European Union, its member states, and United States, should be used to advance these human rights goals. A few days ago another anniversary passed -- the 35th anniversary of Iran's 1979 revolution. Back then the international community's support of the Shah was also premised on long term diplomatic security and stability while paying short shrift to the leadership's human rights abuses. The Iranian people did not forget this. Making the same mistake again is not only wrong, it is surely unwise. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gissou Nia.","Gissou Nia: Feb 14 marks the anniversary of the house arrest of leading opposition figures .

"(CNN) -- People are turning. The misery is too widespread. The privileged are too brazen. The injustice too apparent. On Wall Street, young students have created a free democratic space in a place they call Liberty Square. They protest that Wall Street has been rescued, but there is no help for most Americans. In a moving statement, they presented their view: ""We are the 99%. We are getting kicked out of our homes. We are forced to choose between groceries and rent. We are denied quality medical care. We are suffering from environmental pollution. We are working long hours for little pay and no rights, if we are working at all. We are getting nothing while the other 1 percent is getting everything. We are the 99%."" Their demonstrators were scorned in the beginning. They had no clear demands. They were organized with no formal structure. They were squatting out in the rain, not allowed tents or bedding. But they understood the value of nonviolence. In the face of pepper spray and police provocation, they stayed disciplined. As they were being dragged away to be arrested, they said to the police: ""We are the 99%. We are fighting for your pensions. You should stand with us."" They made no demands but their analysis was dead on. The wealthiest few are capturing all the rewards of growth in this society, while the large majority falls behind. Wall Street got bailed out, rescued without being reorganized, while homeowners were left to fend for themselves. Inequality has reached levels not seen since before the Great Depression. With this kind of inequality -- with the top 1% having as much income as the bottom 60%, according to the Campaign for America's Future -- the economy doesn't work well. The rich turn to speculation. The middle class sinks. And the country suffers. Now conservatives are talking about sending the bill for Wall Street's excesses to the most vulnerable -- cutting Medicare and Social Security, slashing spending on public education. Many of the kids in Occupy Wall Street are graduating from college with thousands in college debt and no jobs are to be found. They are the 99%. The discipline of their demonstrations, the clarity of their moral voice, has touched a chord. Now groups are organizing to occupy financial districts all over the world. I've been to many of the occupy sites: in New York, Chicago, Washington DC, Phoenix, Atlanta, just last month in London. I've seen the faces and places of the Occupy movement. But Occupy is more than places. Occupy is a spirit whose time has come, capturing the people and the world's imagination with a keen focus on the gaps of inequality, unfairness and corruption. The Occupiers' cause is a just cause, a moral cause. It cannot and will not be dismissed, but heard. Listen to the message: . They are the canary in the mine warning us of the dangers... Too few have too much; too many have too little; too much poverty, too much wanting in the land of plenty; too many costly wars. Biblically, Jesus was an occupier. Born under occupation, facing a death warrant on his life, He fled to Egypt -- an immigrant, a political refugee. He represented hope for the oppressed; his mission was to serve the poor. He challenged the prevailing ethos and power of Rome. Gandhi was an occupier. He marched to the sea protesting colonialism and British occupation. He prevailed. Mandela was an occupier, his country occupied by the ruthlessness of apartheid. But Mandela occupied his jail cell on Robben Island, turning it into a library, a center for peaceful, non-violent revolution. He prevailed. Dr. King was an occupier, our country occupied by the vicious and divisive legal segregation. His last great campaign was the Poor People's Campaign, aimed at occupying the Mall in the nation's Capitol to address abounding poverty, the demands for a job or an income for all, health care for all. When Dr. King was shot down on April 4, the campaign moved on to Washington DC, setting up Resurrection City and occupying the nation's Capitol in tents. It was the precursor to today's Occupy movement. We prevailed. Deep into a recession that nearly drove the world economy over the brink in 2008, the eurozone crisis and the recent downgrades of European countries remind us ever to starkly that the dangers of economic collapse remain with us today. Banks got bailed out; people got left out. Banks are making record profits and issuing billions in executive compensation bonuses again. But protestors are criminalized -- homeowners are still being foreclosed on while others find themselves ""underwater"" with debt exceeding the value of their homes. Student loan debt now exceeds credit card debt, and our youth are finding it increasingly difficult to enter, and stay in, college. Big banks are still not lending to small businesses. Yet for all of the excess and scandalous trading practices and policies, not a single top executive from a U.S. bank has gone to jail for their crimes of corruption and greed that drove the global economy to the brink of disaster. In this mirror, a movement for change is building across the country. It was reported that the Wall Street traders drank champagne in their offices as they looked down on the drenched and straggly demonstrators in Liberty Square. They should hold their scorn. This is how change takes place. The courageous stand up -- and more and more people come to their side. The movement for jobs and justice has started up again. As we commemorate Dr. King's birthday this month, we occupy. We are not just dreaming, we are occupying. Occupying until justice rolls down like mighty water. Occupying until a new day of justice appears. Occupying until the bright morning appears. Occupying until peace and love, hope and justice prevails in our land. Keep hope alive. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Reverend Jesse Jackson.","Rev. Jesse Jackson supports the non-violent protests that took place on Wall Street.
He thinks the Occupy movements have spotted the widening gap between rich and poor.

"(CNN) -- San Francisco police have arrested a suspect who they say stole a $200,000 Picasso piece Tuesday from the Weinstein Gallery, according to a police statement. Mark Lugo, 30, was arrested Thursday in Napa, California. His bail has been set at $5 million dollars, police said. Lugo has been charged with six separate counts including burglary, grand theft and possession of controlled substance without prescription, according to a police statement. Around 11:40 a.m. Tuesday, the Lugo allegedly entered the Weinstein Gallery, walked straight to the painting, removed it, and walked out, San Francisco police said. He then entered a cab that appeared to be waiting and drove away. The owner of Lefty O'Doul's, a nearby restaurant, told police Wednesday he thought he captured the suspect on the restaurant's surveillance camera. The video shows a man walking with what looks like a painting under his arm at the same time the gallery reported the theft, CNN affiliate KGO reports. The man captured in the video matched the description police released yesterday, KGO said. ""It's pretty high resolution and I'm sure if they post this on the air that someone will recognize this guy and find him,"" said the restaurants owner, Nick Bovis Wednesday. Investigators described the video as ""very clear"" but they haven't said if they used the tape to identify the suspect. The stolen artwork is a pencil-and-paper piece by Picasso entitled ""Tete de Femme,"" or ""Head of a Woman."" The piece is a unique piece drawn in 1965 and valued around $200,000. Gallery owner Roland Weinstein said he's always attempted  to bring original works by artists like Picasso and and Mark Chagall to  the street level so that they are easily available to the public. ""We just need to do a better job in the future to make sure our security is in place,"" Weinstein said. Investigators have interviewed the cab driver and impounded the  vehicle. All San Francisco cabs have surveillance videos and police are monitoring the tapes for the suspect.","New: Police arrested Mark Lugo in Napa, California.

"(Rolling Stone) -- In the latest Rolling Stone cover story, Canadian DJ-producer Deadmau5 had some pointed words for his fellow EDM musicians and their live performances, criticizing others for simply pressing a few buttons for their live show and calling out successful electronic artists like David Guetta and Skrillex. Now, after reactions from fans and musicians like Swedish House Mafia's Sebastian Ingrosso, Deadmau5 has posted on Tumblr to clarify his statements and to give some insight into his own live shows. ""We all hit play,"" begins the entry. ""It's no secret. When it comes to 'live' performance of EDM... that's about the most it seems you can do anyway."" Deadmau5 continues to say that given one hour of instruction and basic knowledge of the music production program Ableton, anyone could do what he does on stage. Rollingstone.com: On the cover: The rise of Deadmau5 . He further explains his live setup, revealing the heavy data transfers in sync with the light show only allow him a certain limited flexibility. ""There's a good chunk of MIDI [Musical Instrument Digital Interface] data spitting out as well to a handful of synths and crap that are / were used in the actual produciton... which i can tweak *live* and whatnot... but doesnt give me a lot of 'lookit me im Jimi Hendrix check out this solo' stuff, because I'm constrained to work on a set timeline because of the SMPTE [Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers timestamp]."" Rollingstone.com: Inside Deadmau5's Rolling Stone cover shoot . Deadmau5 also stressed the importance of production and studio releases. ""My 'skills' and other PRODUCERS skills shine where it needs to shine... in the goddamned studio, and on the f***ing releases. That's what counts... because this whole big 'EDM' is taking over fad,"" he says.

"(CNN) -- Severe storms including tornadoes struck Illinois late Thursday afternoon, knocking out power, damaging buildings and spawning floods, the National Weather Service reported. On Thursday night, storms and high winds swept across Tennessee on Thursday night, pelting Nashville with rain and hail and putting thousands in the dark. Large sections of the Midwest and South were under tornado watches Thursday evening as powerful and fast-moving storms pushed through the region, with flooding and building damage in Illinois. The Weather Service had preliminary reports of as many as eight tornadoes in central Illinois late Thursday afternoon. In the town of Mechanicsburg, seven outbuildings were reported destroyed and one house had minor damage. WICS TV, a CNN affiliate in nearby Springfield, reported that one camper was knocked over and the woman in it slightly injured. About 24,000 people in Illinois lost power at one point Thursday afternoon and night, reported utility Ameren Illinois. Effingham and Champaign counties in Illinois reported flooding but no injuries or water rescues. ""We have some power lines down and a little water in the road in some places,"" said Pam Jacobs, the director of the Effingham County Emergency Management Agency. She said they had no reports of injuries or stranded vehicles. John Dwyer, the emergency management coordinator for Champaign County, reported some road flooding and standing water in farm fields. A portion of State Route 150 between Mohamet and the county line was shut down. He said the flooding was caused by the 3 inches of rain Thursday coupled with the snow melt. The National Weather service said radar indicated rainfall of 3 to 4 inches per hour. A flash-flood warning was issued until 11:30 p.m. CT Thursday for the area. The Illinois State Police reported that fog caused a serious wreck on Interstate 57 in northeast Illinois, involving at least 27 tractor trailers and passenger cars. Authorities said they received reports of multiple injuries, but nothing life-threatening. In Tennessee, Memphis Light, Gas and Water Division reported that 4,450 customers lost power at the peak of outages in Shelby County, Tennessee, which includes the city of Memphis. As the storm moved east across Tennessee, winds knocked down dozens of trees in Nashville, reported CNN affiliate WSMV. The station said trained weather spotters reported 1-inch hail and 95 mph winds. Tornado and severe thunderstorm watches were in effect for a large area of the south-central United States, including much of Kentucky and Indiana, as well as Illinois, Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. No reports of injuries or deaths were available Thursday evening.","NEW: Power knocked out to about 24,000 customers in Illinois .

"(CNN) -- Few African films have created as much buzz recently as ""Of Good Report,"" a dark tale of a high school teacher who becomes obsessed with a 16-year-old female pupil. The film noir, described by its South African director Jahmil X.T. Qubeka as a ""serial killer origins story about how a social misfit turns into an inadequate man hell-bent on satisfying his shameful lust,"" was selected to open the 34th Durban International Film Festival on July 18. But when the day arrived, instead of the movie's opening credits, the festival audience was welcomed with the following on-screen message: . ""This film has been refused classification by the Film and Publication Board, in terms of the Film and Publications Act 1996. Unfortunately we may not legally screen the film 'Of Good Report' as to do so would constitute a criminal offense."" The Film Board's decision was based on a scene between the teacher and pupil that it said constituted child pornography. After the announcement, Qubeka appeared on stage with his mouth taped as a sign of protest. But later on, the ban was overturned on appeal and ""Of Good Report"" was screened on the last day of the festival, classified as suitable for viewers aged 16 or over. Read this: 10 must-see African movies . Qubeka was also awarded a new annual prize for Artistic Bravery as an acknowledgment of ""the film's achievements in stimulating worldwide debate and highlighting important issues in South African society."" CNN's Errol Barnett spoke to Qubeka about the controversy surrounding the film and the state of cinema in South Africa. An edited version of the interview follows. CNN: As frustrating as it was, the initial ban on the film did create buzz. How big of a relief was the overturn of the ban? Qubeka: Any filmmaker wants their film to be seen, any filmmaker wants their film to resonate. In that regard, I'm happy for the exposure -- and because I believe in the film and because I actually think it's the best thing I've done in 12 years I've been a filmmaker and I've taken the time to craft it. I'm happy that the attention is there because the piece will stand for itself. It may not raise the questions that people expected to, but as a piece of cinema I think it's relatively satisfying. CNN: How important is the Durban International Film Festival as a platform of expression in South Africa? Qubeka: This is a film festival, one with a history of protest, of showing taboo work. Even during the apartheid period when films were banned, this festival found a way to show those films. The majority of people that go to see these films are filmmakers from all over the world. So this is the space where they would have had the opportunity to engage the film community. Read this: Hollywood classics get African remake . It's a privilege to do what I do; it's a privilege to be able to have the tools to create worlds that people can engage both psychologically, emotionally and subconsciously. There's a responsibility behind that. I worked in advertising as a director of commercials for eight years, I understand what the power of image and sound does to a human being. Because of that, there's a responsibility I have -- however crazy or questioning or whatever my stories are, I have a responsibility for every single person who watches my film that even if I shake their very core, I must not violate them. That's my own rule. CNN: The film though is not necessarily about this taboo relationship, it's about a serial killer. Qubeka: Yes, I made it as a serial killer origins story. It's about someone who tastes blood and gets away with it and now is on a particular kind of mission. And it's about how he got to that space, that's how I had put the film together. Also, it focuses and addresses a serious issue in my country, which is child pregnancy. It focuses on an issue where if you go around the provinces and you look at stats, so many teenagers are involved in illicit relationships with older men. So it touches on those social issues and I hope it opens up debate. That was the main intention. And it's also to scare the bejesus out of these kids. I hope when they watch my film they're like, 'I'm not going anywhere near some old man who's offering me a cell phone and some pocket money.' And I want to scare the parents. I want to say, 'I know you have busy lives, and have to earn an income, but just take the time and really screen the people you hand your kids over to.' These people, these custodians of society, the teacher, whether it's the priest down the road, whoever. The people that come of good report. Screen them a little bit. You don't know who they are. They could be the big bad wolf. That's what it's about. CNN: You are a new parent, so the idea of protecting children is something that is close to home for you. Qubeka: Completely; it resonates with me because it says that no matter what I'm doing, I need to understand the people I hand my kids over to. That's where the responsibility lies. CNN: What one word would you use to describe African film today? Qubeka: Hybrid; I gravitate toward it because to me it says it's in motion, it's alive, it's still trying to define itself and that to me is exciting.","New South African movie Of Good Report"" was originally banned .

"(CNN) -- I hesitated. I vacillated. I fluctuated. I scratched, spat, sucked on sunflower seeds, adjusted my cup (coffee), wiped dirt from my palms onto my pants, tried to do what a ballplayer would do. I dug in, waggled my pen, stared at my baseball Hall of Fame ballot like I'd like to kill it. Do I vote for HIM? No, he cheated and got caught. Do I vote for HIM? I don't know .... he was just suspected of cheating. How about HIM? No, he didn't get enough hits. But what about HIM? He got a whole lot of hits, but was he as good as HIM? This guy's on the ballot for the first time. Whereas that guy's on it for the 15th and last time. This guy's a jackass, a jerk. Oh, man, though, could he hit. This guy's a pleasure, a prince. But he sure couldn't hit like that guy. And, whoa, that guy could pitch. So could this guy, but sure wasn't that guy. I voted. I mailed it. I even stuck a Willie Stargell forever stamp on the envelope, although the postage was already on it. I waited. I wondered. Who would make it? Barry Bonds, yes or no? Roger Clemens, yes or no? Mike Piazza? Sammy Sosa? Craig Biggio? Jeff Bagwell? Jack Morris? Maybe none? NONE??? Yes, I kept hearing as the December 31 vote deadline passed, very possibly not a one. Wednesday, the news came. The non-news. Whatever you want to call it. Yes, the answer was no. No to all. No to the man with 762 home runs. No to the pitcher who won 354 games. No to the hitter who got 3,060 hits. Bonds (762 homers, most ever) struck out. He needed 427 votes. He got 206. Eight other guys on the ballot got more votes than he did. Clemens (354 wins) got lit up. He got 214. Three other pitchers got more votes than he did. Biggio, (3,060 hits) came closest. He got 388, fell a mere 39 votes shy of a date in Cooperstown, New York, with a nice, bronzed bust and plaque. It was like he won all the electoral votes he needed except Florida and Ohio. He gave it a great shot. Maybe next time. I could try to justify it. I could try to explain it. I won't. I can't. It is an election. Everybody has a right to be wrong. A total of 569 ballots were cast. Five were turned in blank. I guess those voters have their reasons, bizarre as they are. A total of 37 names were on the ballot. No one won. I don't know why. I can't tell you why one of those 569 voters gave a yes to Aaron Sele, a pitcher who won 148 games. I have no problem with Aaron Sele, but if he is a Hall of Famer, I am the husband of the Duchess of Cambridge. Will I reveal my own vote? No, I won't. Not even whether I voted for Clemens and Bonds? OK, dammit, I did. Baseball writers balk at Hall of Fame class of '13 . I am not necessarily proud of it. I was not 100% sure which way to go. I crunched the numbers on a number of the candidates, tried to weigh their qualifications, make up my mind if a guy was a Hall of Famer or merely wonderful. No such crunch was necessary for Clemens or Bonds. Their stats were insane. Off the charts. I generally know a Hall of Famer when I see one, and whenever I saw those two guys, I saw two. But each had an asterisk.* . * Not a real asterisk. A make-believe asterisk. Or more of a question mark, I guess. Cheater? Charlatan? Liar? Fraud? Neither of them, in my opinion, were proven beyond a shadow of a doubt to have broken baseball's laws and rules. We can do the ""you know and I know they did"" thing all day long, but neither Barry Bonds nor Roger Clemens was ever banned, suspended or disciplined by Major League Baseball for being a steroids cheat. Others got caught red-handed. Busted. Banished from the field for a specified period the way Hall of Fame candidate Rafael Palmeiro was and the way future Hall of Fame candidate Manny Ramirez was. I can't look the same way at the accused the way I do at the convicted. I know, or know of, a lot of my brother and sister voters. I know they know baseball, love it, put a lot of thought into it. Here is a partial list of Baseball Writers' Association of America members who publicly acknowledged that they did cast votes for Clemens and Bonds: . Barry Bloom, Jim Caple, Chris De Luca, Gordon Edes, Jeff Fletcher, Gerry Fraley, Paul Hagen, Tom Haudricourt, Mike Imrem, Bruce Jenkins, Richard Justice, Tim Kawakami, Tom Keegan, Tim Kurkjian, Carrie Muskat, Bob Nightengale, Ian O'Connor, Buster Olney, Rob Parker, Joe Posnanski, Ron Rapoport, Tracy Ringolsby, Henry Schulman, Claire Smith, Jayson Stark, Dave Van Dyck. Now here is a partial list of BBWAA voters who said no to Clemens and Bonds: . Mike Bass, Michael Bauman, Hal Bodley, Murray Chass, Pedro Gomez, Mark Gonzales, Scot Gregor, Ken Gurnick, Jon Heyman, Phil Hersh, Ann Killion, Wallace Matthews, Bruce Miles, Scott Miller, Fred Mitchell, Terence Moore, Mike Nadel, Marty Noble, Mark Purdy, Phil Rogers, Ken Rosenthal, Bob Ryan, Dan Shaughnessy, Paul Sullivan, Rick Telander, Tom Verducci, Charlie Vincent. They can't ALL be wrong. I have been maintaining since I began voting in the late 1980s that there are three kinds of professional baseball players -- the good, the great and the immortal. You cannot play baseball for a living without being good. You can become great, or you can even become one of the greatest of all time. Bonds and Clemens are among the greatest of all time, without a doubt. But they have extenuating circumstances. Biggio never seemed a mortal lock to be an immortal the way Bonds and Clemens do, but I cannot tell you in a million years why 181 voters did not put a check mark by his name. (I did.) Nor do I have a clue where the Hall of Fame goes from here. It took Bert Blyleven and Jim Rice a ridiculous number of tries to become Hall of Famers, but they made it. It took 15 ballot failures and a couple of post-election rejections before Ron Santo made it, but he made it. Posthumously, but he made it. I hear TV and radio announcers call a player ""a surefire Hall of Famer"" and I have no idea what universe they reside in that permits their mouths to form these words. There is no such thing as a surefire Hall of Famer any more. Greg Maddux will be on the ballot next year. Frank Thomas will, too. If either of them fails, I will eat my cap. I will never, ever, ever refer to either as ""a surefire Hall of Famer,"" however, because that ship has sailed. The voters have spoken, as politicians have put it. I know there are millions of you who hate the way it came out. I do, too. Baseball is not supposed to be a game in which nobody wins. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mike Downey.","Not one of the 37 players on the 2013 ballot will be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame .

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- NBA superstar LeBron James arrived in the Miami area Friday, the morning after he spurned the Cleveland Cavaliers for the Miami Heat. Southern Florida's newest VIP is causing a stir already. The Heat announced it has sold out its ""currently available"" season ticket inventory. After ""extremely brisk"" sales over the past couple of weeks, sales peaked ""in a new intensity the last couple of days,"" Heat President of Business Operations Eric Woolworth said in a press release. Since Wednesday, James and his fellow U.S. Olympian and perennial NBA all-star Chris Bosh have committed to leaving their old teams to join the Heat and its star, Dwyane Wade. Wade led the Heat to the 2006 NBA championship and has agreed to re-sign with Miami and Bosh was a standout with the Toronto Raptors. Wade said Bosh's decision made it easy for him and James to choose their destinations. ""When Chris Bosh said he wanted to be down here in Miami, I think that opened up the floodgates for all of us to say, 'You know what? This is the time to do something in history that hasn't been done,' and that's all three players of this caliber come together in their prime to do something amazing."" Wade said. ""We're going to be a really good team,"" James said. James, who joined the Cavaliers straight out of high school and played forward for the team for his entire career, announced his decision during a much-ballyhooed ESPN special Thursday entitled ""The Decision."" The reigning two-time NBA MVP said a conversation with his mother Thursday morning sealed the deal. ""I think I decided this morning,"" James said. ""Then I talked with my mom. Once I had that conversation with her I think I was set."" James looked at several teams, including New York, Chicago and Cleveland. It came down to one thing. ""The major factor was the best opportunity to win now and to win in the future."" James said. He led the Cavaliers to the NBA finals in 2007, where they lost to the San Antonio Spurs, but never reached the finals again, despite Cleveland management bringing in supporting stars such as Shaquille O'Neal and Antawn Jamison. During ""The Decision,"" ESPN switched briefly to sports bars in Miami and Cleveland to summarize the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat. A few Cavs fans wasted no time in burning James jerseys in a small fire. Cavs owner Dan Gilbert  called James' decision a ""cowardly betrayal"" and a ""shocking act of disloyalty"" in a letter posted on the team's website Thursday night. He then added, in all capital letters: . ""I PERSONALLY GUARANTEE THAT THE CLEVELAND CAVALIERS WILL WIN AN NBA CHAMPIONSHIP BEFORE THE SELF-TITLED FORMER 'KING' WINS ONE. You can take it to the bank."" Miami fans were elated. ""I think this is the best thing since sliced bread. Are you serious?"" said Christina Onori. ""I think this is the most unbelievable thing to happen to Miami, ever."" Woolworth said non-season ticket holders will still get to see the Heat's trio of superstars, because ""in contrast to past practice, we have determined not to sell any season tickets in our 400 level this season and will reserve that inventory for some combination of group tickets, partial plans and variably priced individual game tickets... to provide access to as much of our community as possible."" He added that fans interested in season tickets could be placed on a waiting list ""as we anticipate the release of additional inventory in the near future."" The Heat's new power trio wasn't the only reason for the rush on season tickets, which began weeks earlier, before James, Bosh or Wade had committed to the Miami. The team pledged in February that ""while we were holding the pricing flat for our loyal returning season ticket holders, it was our intention to raise our season ticket prices for new buyers in July."" said Woolworth. Besides the Heat, the Boys and Girls Club of America and Twitter were beneficiaries of James' decision. The club expected to receive about $2.5 million in support from the show and related activities. ""The money will be used to support James' vision to construct basketball courts for youth across the country,"" the Atlanta-based organization said. James had more than 345,000 followers, and counting, on his ""KingJames"" Twitter account Thursday evening. CNN's Emanuella Grinberg contributed to this report.","NEW: LeBron James visits Miami Friday .

"(CNN) -- MTV is hoping to give its get-out-the-vote campaign a viral boost with an online game, inspired by fantasy sports, that rewards players for participating in the 2012 elections. Gamers will rack up points in ""Fantasy Election '12"" for registering to vote, watching debates and publicly supporting candidates with transparent fundraising records and who refrain from political mudslinging. ""This can be can be a crash course in what people should demand from those pursuing the privilege of elected office,"" said Jason Rzepka, MTV's vice president of public affairs, who revealed details about the game to in advance of its Tuesday launch. As in fantasy football or baseball, ""Fantasy Election"" is an online social game in which participants strategically build virtual teams of candidates and compete against other players from around the country for glory and prizes. Players can ""draft"" any candidate running for the U.S. presidency, the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives. To encourage players to select honest, inspiring politicians, the most valuable candidates will have measurable integrity as well as strong poll numbers. Each candidate's ""value"" will be an aggregation of several key data points from specific partners: . ● Polling data from poll aggregator, RealClearPolitics.com. The longer a candidate is winning his or her race, the more points they'll earn. ● A transparency fundraising score from the Center for Responsive Politics, which publicizes campaign contribution and spending data. For instance, Ron Paul would score well in this category, given that he famously tried to disclose every single campaign expenditure -- even a 22-cent purchase at FedEx. ● Frequency of social media engagement on Twitter and Facebook. ● Declaring their stances on Project Vote Smart's ""Political Courage Test,"" which ""measures each candidate's willingness to provide citizens with their positions on key issues."" ● Discussing substantive issues rather than airing ""uncivil, personal ads"", as ranked by the Wesleyan Media Project, which houses a public database of information on the ""content and targeting"" of broadcast television advertisements from around the country. ""There's a lot of young people who are at the beginning of their civic career,"" says Rzepka. ""When you're 18 and you're voting for the first time, you don't necessarily know what you deserve from a politician."" He says he hopes the game will instill the habits of good citizenship among young voters. Additionally, MTV hopes that highlighting the most virtuous political candidates will re-energize young citizens, many of whom are disheartened by the sputtering economy and a perception among some voters that President Obama failed to meet the high (and perhaps unrealistic) expectations they had for him. According to Gallup, the so-called Millennial generation -- mostly people now in their twenties -- are the only age group to show a significant drop in whether they ""care a good deal who is elected president next year,"" from 81% in 2007 to 69% in 2011. Russell Dalton, a political science professor at the University of California, Irvine, credits distrust in government with the substantial percentage of Generation Y citizens who would rather spend hours creating a viral campaign video than cast a ballot. ""I think because of their cynicism and lack of control, they would rather do something direct,"" said Dalton, author of ""The Good Citizen: How a Younger Generation Is Reshaping American Politics."" ""The paramount objective [of the game] is to get young people to register to vote,"" said MTV's Rzekpa. Being a savvy spectator won't be enough to win the game, he says. Players will need to keep abreast of the latest news, register to vote via a streamlined application on the Rock the Vote website and exert subtle peer pressure on their fence-leaning friends. They also earn points by checking in at town halls and voting stations via Foursquare. The details of the game won't be finalized until the private beta launch around June, but Facebook is the likely hub of ""Fantasy Election."" The invite-only beta will give MTV's ""Fantasy Election"" team some room to tweak the game before its public debut in late summer or early fall. Rzepka expects MTV will leverage ""hundreds of thousands of dollars"" in prizes to fuel sustained enthusiasm for the game. Big-ticket items will likely be a coveted invitation to the network's annual Video Music Awards or an invitation to an inaugural ball next January in Washington. Columbia University political science professor Daniel Green says he's skeptical that ""Fantasy Election"" will motivate young people who are not engaged with the political process. He believes face-to-face interactions are the most effective way to increase turnout and that the game's success will depend on whether its players experience the same kinds of emotions via Facebook as older generations do through real-life conversations. ""To people who are really only distantly connected, I'm not sure the blandishment of Facebook wall posting would necessarily be all that influential,"" Green said. But for someone's inner circle of close friends, ""Facebook could be quite powerful."" Even if MTV can't make Generation Y a huge voting bloc, Rzepka believes the network can still be influential. ""We're not going to solve the problems we face with voting alone,"" he said. ""If we as MTV can get them [young citizens] when they're 18 and when they're 22, they are a long way on their way to being active and informed participants in our democracy from now on.""","MTV to launch game that rewards players for being informed about the 2012 elections .

Mubarak ""is gambling with his country"" in order to stay at the helm, ElBaradei told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. He reiterated the message of his Twitter account, which read, ""Egypt will explode. Army must save the country now."" Major clashes between the people and the army, which Egyptians traditionally believe has been on their side, would be devastating, said ElBaradei, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency. ElBaradei's outlook had changed since hours before, when Egyptians, including thousands packed in Cairo's Tahrir Square, expected Mubarak to step down rather than delegate powers to Vice President Omar Suleiman. The arrangement failed to mollify opposition leaders or those who have rallied in Tahrir Square for more than two weeks. Another mass protest is planned again Friday after prayer services. ""Mubarak is only one part of this regime,"" human rights activist Gigi Ibrahim, one of the Tahrir Square protesters, told CNN. ""People have been here for 17 days, and they are not for Suleiman, either,"" Ibrahim said. ""Mubarak has lost all legitimacy, and now him handing over the power to the vice president is as illegitimate as Mubarak being in power."" ElBaradei told CNN that Egyptians will not accept the new arrangement. ""Suleiman is considered to be an extension of Mubarak. They are twins. Neither of them is acceptable to the people,"" he said. ""For the sake of their country, they should go."" ElBaradei said a leadership council and a caretaker government should rule the North African nation for one year during a transition to a more democratic process. Mubarak's defiant remarks about foreign intervention, and his determination to see the transition through, was not what most in the Tahrir Square crowd wanted to hear. ""Get out! Get out!"" many chanted as he spoke. After the speech, parliamentary speaker Ahmed Fathi Srour told state-run Nile TV that Mubarak's move had put the authority for the day-to-day running of the government in Suleiman's hands. The vice president referred to the past two weeks as the ""revolution of the young people."" Suleiman told the protesters to go home and back to work. That had not happened by early Friday. Yaser Fathi, one of the organizers of a post-speech protest in the northern city of Alexandria, told CNN hundreds of demonstrators marched to an Egyptian military base. They asked the armed forces to intervene and shouted that ""the military must step in to get Mubarak out,"" Fathi said. Khalid Abdalla, a demonstrator in Tahrir Square and star of the motion picture ""The Kite Runner,"" said early Friday that it's ""an incredibly sad moment right now."" ""Everyone's lost,"" the actor said. ""People are trying to work out what more they can do."" Egyptian journalist, writer and blogger Ethar El-Katatney, appearing on CNN's ""Parker Spitzer"" Thursday night, likened Mubarak's speech to American television's ""Father Knows Best."" His earlier speech announcing he would step down in September had gained him some empathy, she said. El-Katatney said she was worried that Friday could be ""bloody"" because of the people's frustration. Nobel laureate Ahmed Zewail, a potential Egyptian presidential candidate, said he sees ""several different scenarios"" through which a transition could take place. ""The important thing is that the army will protect this transition until a new Constitution is in place,"" Zewail told CNN before the Mubarak speech. ""I am very much appreciative of the fact that armed forces are controlling what's going on."" Freed cyberactivist Wael Ghonim, who emerged as a reluctant hero of Egypt's uprising, had seemed pleased with just the prospect of Mubarak leaving office. He is on leave from his marketing job with the search engine Google in Dubai and was held for 10 days during the protests. ""Revolution 2.0: Mission Accomplished,"" Ghonim wrote on his Twitter account earlier Thursday, before Mubarak's speech. CNN's Ivan Watson, Saad Abedine and Arwa Damon contributed to this report.","Mohamed ElBaradei says Mubarak and Suleiman are ""twins""

"(CNN) -- A paramedic who responded to a horrific, deadly fertilizer plant explosion in West, Texas -- and who later spoke at a memorial for its victims -- pleaded guilty Thursday after accusations he possessed materials to make a pipe bomb. Bryce Reed pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess a destructive device and attempted obstruction of justice, according to his lawyer Jonathan Sibley. In August, McLennan County Criminal District Attorney Abel Reyna said he hadn't seen ""credible evidence"" linking Reed's possession of a prohibited weapon to the April 17 blast at a West Fertilizer Company facility. A fire led to the ammonium nitrate explosion, which killed 15 people -- most of them firefighters and paramedics -- and devastated West, a small town about 20 miles north of Waco and 75 miles south of Dallas. Dozens of homes, two schools and a nursing home suffered significant damage in the blast, which was so big that seismographs registered it as a small earthquake. Reed was among the emergency workers who responded to the site. He was vocal afterward as well, speaking to reporters and at a memorial service at Baylor University for the blast's victims. ""There's no way I would have ever dreamed that this would have happened,"" Reed told CNN's ""AC 360."" ""I mean, it's profound and it's dire, and it hurts like hell."" Yet Reed himself became a target of authorities after components of a pipe bomb were found at a residence, according to a criminal complaint affidavit. The officers determined that Reed had given the materials -- including galvanized metal pipe, a fuse, coils of metal ribbon and several bags of chemical powders -- to that home's resident. In a statement, Reed's lawyers stressed that neither the charge nor the plea agreement ""have anything to do with the tragic explosion."" He chose to plead guilty, they said, ""to accept full responsibility for what he believes is his role in the allegations against him"" and avoid a drawn-out trial. ""Finally, ... Mr. Reed believes that continuing to draw out this process will be a distraction to the most important issue, the losses suffered by the heroes, friends and loved ones in the West community,"" his lawyers said.","Lawyer: Bryce Reed pleads guilty to conspiracy to possess a destructive device .

"(CNN) -- A billion messages are sent on Twitter every 2Â½ days. That's three for every man, woman and child in the United States. Sure, the vast majority of tweets haven't made history. But there have been no shortage of big moments for Twitter since its debut more than seven years ago. That's part of the reason Twitter has become a digital watercooler of sorts for global conversations around live TV events such as elections, the Oscars or the Super Bowl. With news that Twitter has filed to become a publicly traded company, we took a look back at some of the key moments from its brief history. From celebrity-driven milestones to political downfalls to tweets from space, they've been as diverse as the more than 200 million people who now use the site. May we present seven years of famous, and infamous, tweets and Twitterers: . March 2006 -- The first-ever tweet was posted by co-founder Jack Dorsey as part of an internal messaging system for Odeo, the podcasting company where Dorsey, Biz Stone and Evan Williams worked at the time. It said simply, ""just setting up my twttr."" July 2006 -- The full version of Twitter was introduced publicly on July 15, although Twitter didn't spin off into its own company until the next year. March 2007 -- Although not yet mainstream, Twitter exploded in popularity among early adopters at the South By Southwest Interactive festival in Austin, Texas. In a clever move, the company placed large screens in conference hallways that displayed live tweets about SXSW events. Buzz quickly grew, and by the end of the week, daily Twitter usage had tripled. April 2008 -- In an early example of the power of Twitter, an American graduate student used the service to alert his friends that he had been arrested at an anti-government protest in Mahalla, Egypt. After mounting pressure, authorities released him from jail the next day. January 2009 -- A US Airways plane with 155 people on board made a miraculous emergency landing on the Hudson River after striking a bird during takeoff. An eyewitness tweeted out a widely shared photo of passengers waiting on the plane's wing to be rescued, cementing Twitter's status as a real-time, news-gathering tool. April 2009 -- Actor Ashton Kutcher narrowly outpaces CNN to become the first Twitter user with 1 million followers. June 2009 -- After a disputed election in Iran, thousands of people took to the streets of Tehran in protest. The Iranian government cracked down on media reports about the protests, so demonstrators took to Twitter to get the word out, inspiring the phrase, ""Twitter Revolution."" August 2009 -- Justin Halpern was amused by his father's blunt wisecracks so he created a Twitter account called ""Sh*t My Dad Says."" Within months he had millions of followers and a book deal, which led to a short-lived CBS sitcom, ""$#*! My Dad Says,"" starring William Shatner. January 2010 -- Astronaut Timothy Creamer sent the first live tweet from space under his account, Astro_TJ. It said: ""Hello Twitterverse! We r now LIVE tweeting from the International Space Station â€” the 1st live tweet from Space! :) More soon, send your ?s."" April 2010 -- The Library of Congress announces plans to archive every public tweet on Twitter. January 2011 -- Twitter and Facebook play a key role in ""Arab Spring"" uprisings as people in Tunisa, Egypt, Syria, Libya and other countries used the social networks to message each other and organize protests. March 2011 -- Within minutes of news reports about an Egyptian cobra escaping from its enclosure at the Bronx Zoo, an anonymous jokester created a witty Twitter account that imagined the freed snake sightseeing its way around New York City. (Sample tweet: ""Leaving Wall Street. These guys make my skin crawl."") The account quickly amassed more than 100,000 followers and heralded a new wave of parody Twitter feeds. May 2011 -- Sohaib Athar, an IT consultant in Abbottabad, Pakistan, unwittingly live tweeted the U.S. Navy Seals' raid that killed Osama bin Laden after spotting helicopters hovering over his neighborhood. He later tweeted, ""Uh oh, now I'm the guy who liveblogged the Osama raid without knowing it."" June 2011 -- U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner resigned in disgrace after confessing to sending lewd photos of himself to women on Twitter. Weiner may never get the hang of this Twitter thing: His ill-fated New York mayoral bid was derailed this month by similar revelations. June 2012 -- NASA landed a rover, Curiosity, safely on Mars and began exploring the Red Planet while beaming updates to Earthlings via a clever and educational Twitter account. Today it has 1.4 million followers. November 2012 -- President Obama acknowledged his successful re-election with a tweeted image of him embracing his wife, Michelle, and the words ""Four more years."" With almost 800,000 retweets, it became the most-shared tweet ever. November 2012 -- The Israel Defence Forces live-tweeted its rocket attacks against Hamas in Gaza, including a photo of a Hamas leader it claimed to have kllled. Some observers saw it as the first time a military conflict was chronicled in real time on social media. December 2012 -- Pope Benedict XVI joined Twitter as @Pontifex, becoming the first pontiff to do so. His successor, Pope Francis, has continued the papal account, which now has almost 3 million followers for the English language account, and 3.7 for the Spanish Twitter handle, @Pontifex_es. January 2013 -- Twitter users in Japan and Korea set a record by posting 33,388 tweets per second in their time zone as the New Year dawned on January 1. January 2013 -- Justin Bieber dethroned fellow pop star Lady Gaga to become the most followed person on Twitter. The Biebs now has more than 44 million followers. January 2013 -- Twitter launched Vine, an app that lets users shoot and share 6-second looping videos. It has since acquired more than 13 million followers, who fill their followers' feeds with delightfully strange video creations. February 2013 -- The Super Bowl was already one of Twitter's annual high points, when would-be wits unleashed some of their best 140-character one-liners. But this year, when a racy Beyonce halftime show was followed by a 35-minute power outage, things went into overdrive. At the peak, there were more than 268,000 tweets per minute -- and more than 24 million for the entire game. April 2013 -- Hackers from the Syrian Electronic Army took over the Associated Press Twitter account and posted ""Breaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured."" It was one of the most high-profile Twitter hacks to date and had far-reaching ramifications. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted dramatically before rebounding when the hoax was exposed. CNN's Doug Gross contributed to this report.","Twitter has filed to become a publicly traded company .

"(CNN) -- Illinois put an end to capital punishment Wednesday as Gov. Pat Quinn signed legislation abolishing the practice and commuting the sentences of his state's remaining death row inmates. The move came 11 years after a spate of death-row exonerations prompted one of Quinn's predecessors to halt executions. In announcing his decision, Quinn said that a flawed system of capital punishment had put the state in ""grave danger"" of putting innocent prisoners to death and that creating a ""mistake-free"" system was impossible. ""Having said that, we cannot have a death-penalty system in our state which kills innocents, and unfortunately our system was in grave danger of doing exactly that in 20 instances,"" he said. Illinois conducted its last execution in 1999. Then-Gov. George Ryan, a Republican, halted executions in 2000 after revelations that 20 death-row convicts were not guilty of the crimes that put them there. Ryan commuted 167 death sentences to life in prison without parole, and Quinn commuted another 15 on Wednesday. Quinn's move leaves 34 states and the federal government with capital punishment on the books. Illinois is the third state to abolish the practice since 2007, and a court ruling struck down New York's death-penalty law in 2004. Quinn, a Democrat, took office after the 2009 impeachment of Gov. Rod Blagojevich and won a full term in November. During the campaign, he said he would support keeping the death penalty for the ""most severe"" crimes. But he said Wednesday that he had ""no regrets"" about his decision. ""I think it's the right and just thing to abolish the death penalty and punish those who commit heinous crimes, evil people, with life in prison without parole or any chance of release,"" said Quinn. Several prosecutors and the Fraternal Order of Police had lobbied to keep the death penalty, arguing that reforms passed after Ryan's moratorium had improved the system and that the threat of execution deterred crime. Ted Street, the state FOP president, said execution should remain a potential punishment in ""extreme cases"" like the killing of a police officer or a child. And police and prosecutors have used the threat of the death penalty to help obtain a suspect's cooperation, he said. ""The criminal, when they know their cooperation in an investigation will yield that case not being forwarded to the death penalty, they might be more cooperative. And we've seen that many times,"" Street said. He predicted opponents in the legislature would try to reinstate capital punishment before long. ""I believe it's going to prove over time to be problematic,"" Street said. And state Sen. William Haine, one of several Democrats to oppose repeal, said Quinn should have pushed for a statewide debate and a referendum on whether to keep capital punishment. ""This removes a remedy of the people of Illinois for great and evil acts of a unique kind: wanton cruelty, terrorism, rape and murder, the butchery of small children, mass murder,"" said Haine, from the southern city of Alton. ""It removes a remedy for the community to seek the penalty of death in which someone forfeits one's life for these great wrongs committed to innocent people."" But Quinn's decision drew swift praise from the American Civil Liberties Union, which called it a ""historic stand"" by the governor and state lawmakers. ""Executions in this country are carried out as part of an unequal system of justice, in which innocent people are too often sentenced to death and decisions about who lives and who dies are largely dependent upon the skill of their attorneys, the race of their victim, their socioeconomic status and where the crime took place,"" John Holdridge, director of the ACLU Capital Punishment Project, said in a statement issued after Quinn's announcement. ""Such arbitrary and discriminatory administration of the death penalty, which comes at an enormous financial cost to taxpayers, is the very definition of a failed system, and the state of Illinois is to be commended for ending it."" And the Catholic Conference of Illinois said abolishing the death penalty ""advances the development of a culture of life in our state."" ""No longer will there be a risk in Illinois that an innocent person will be convicted and sentenced to death. The law becomes effective on July 1, 2011,"" the conference said in a written statement. It added, ""Society will continue to be protected and those who commit crimes will still be held accountable through alternatives to the death penalty, including life without parole.""","Gov. Pat Quinn says his decision was ""the right and just thing""

"(CNN) -- Ossie Schectman may not have had the hops of Michael Jordan, the strength of Wilt Chamberlain or the touch of Jerry West. But he'll always be the first. Schectman played a single season -- 1946-1947 -- with the New York Knickerbockers, but still managed to make his mark on the National Basketball Association by scoring what the league says is its first points. On Tuesday, according to his former team, Schectman died at age 94. ""Ossie Schectman was a true NBA pioneer,"" NBA Commissioner David Stern said. The history was made November 1, 1946, when the Knicks traveled to Canada to take on the Toronto Huskies. Video from that game -- the first in what was then the Basketball Association of America, which a few years later became the NBA -- shows him finishing a give-and-go with a layup. ""They score a clean first basket,"" the announcer says on the video. ""Dazzling passing."" By the time that shot went through the hoop, Schectman had already made a name for himself on the court. The New York native attended Samuel Tilden High School in Brooklyn, then went about 25 miles east to play at Long Island University. There, he starred on two teams -- in 1939 and 1941 -- that won the National Invitation Tournament, then considered in many respects more prestigious than the NCAA tourney. He earned first-team All-America honors after that second title, his university notes. After graduating college, Schectman joined the Philadelphia Sphas (which stood for South Philadelphia Hebrew Association) of the American Basketball League. He would perhaps be most associated with that pro team if it were not for his time with the Knicks, including the first points in its first game, which New York won 68-66. His on-court prowess helped land him spots in the Jewish Sports Hall of Fame, Long Island University Athletic Hall of Fame and New York City Basketball Hall of Fame. ""What kind of player was Ossie?"" asks a tweet on the official NBA History feed. ""Think (Chris Paul). A relentless penetrator who would routinely set up his teammates."" Schectman was accomplished outside basketball as well. As LIU noted in a profile upon granting Schectman with its distinguished alumni award in 2013, he served in the U.S. Air Corps during World War II. Schectman had success in business as well, including more than three decades working in Manhattan's garment district before his retirement from Collins and Aikman. He and his wife, Evelyn, had two children and two grandchildren. Still, it's that one shot in the fall of 1946, immortalized in the documentary film ""The First Basket,"" that many most associate him with, now and for decades to come.

"(CNN) -- Agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration raided two CVS pharmacies in central Florida over the weekend, removing controlled substances and suspending the stores' ability to handle or distribute drugs such as painkillers oxycodone and hydrocodone. The DEA said that during one year, the two pharmacies -- both in Sanford, Florida -- ordered more than 3 million oxycodone units from a pharmaceutical wholesaler, while a typical pharmacy orders 69,000. ""Each registrant (pharmacy) was filling prescriptions far in excess of legitimate needs of its customers,"" said DEA Special Agent in Charge Mark Trouville during a press conference Monday in central Florida. The DEA also has suspended the controlled-substance license of the wholesale distributor, Cardinal Health of Lakeland, Florida, according to Trouville. ""Cardinal Health did not fulfill its due diligence to insure controlled substances were not diverted into other than legitimate channels,"" Trouville said. On Friday, Cardinal Health filed and received an emergency injunction from a federal judge in Washington allowing the drug supplier to continue filling orders for other pharmacies. ""We believe the DEA is wrong,"" said Cardinal Health Chairman and CEO George Barrett in a written statement. ""We strongly disagree with the allegations the DEA has made against our facility and intend to vigorously challenge this action,"" said Barrett. The two Sanford pharmacies remain open filling regular prescriptions but they cannot fill prescriptions for controlled substances such as oxycodone, one form of which is the well-known narcotic OxyContin. CVS said in a written statement that the company is disappointed by the DEA actions but is fully cooperating with the DEA suspension. ""CVS/pharmacy is unwavering in its compliance with and support of the measures taken by federal and state law enforcement officials to prevent drug abuse and keep controlled substances out of the wrong hands,"" said CVS spokesman Mike DeAngelis. Hearings on the suspensions will be held but no date has been set. Trouville said that since the state of Florida moved to crack down on ""pill mills"" by banning doctors from directly distributing controlled narcotics, pharmacy sales of controlled substances have skyrocketed.","The DEA says two pharmacies ordered more than 3 million oxycodone units in a year .

"(CNN) -- The rumor: Girls love a guy who helps out at home . If you're the kinda gal (or guy) who thinks there's nothing more appealing than a man who cuts the grass, folds the laundry and shuttles the kids to lacrosse practice, you're not alone. So guys who help more at home get more at home, right? That makes sense, but then some are saying men who do chores get less sex than men who don't. The verdict: Helping around the house improves guys' chances, but not every chore counts . Interestingly enough, it seems a guy can bring home the bacon and fry it up in a pan, but once he cleans the pan, women forget he's a man. A study published in the American Sociological Review claims men who engage in ""traditionally female labor"" (dishes, laundry, etc.) get less sex than those who do not. But, the study also finds that, ""A couple's sex life is governed by a gendered set of sexual scripts,"" meaning that men who do typical ""guy"" chores, such as mowing the grass, do, in fact, get lucky more often. upwave: Tips for having more sex this week .

Does that image send you to the bedroom? The authors indicate that this whole huff might just involve a distinction between the kind of work we subconsciously categorize as ""manly"" versus the chores we want them to do -- but as they are doing them, something in the primitive parts of our brains alerts us that something is very off, so we quite literally turn off.

"(CNN) -- Liza Long didn't think anyone would notice her blog outside of a small circle of friends. But she was wrong, way wrong. Millions of people were keenly interested in the Idaho mother's struggles with the 13-year-old son she loves and fears. A 40-year-old mother of four, Long teaches English at a small college in Boise. On Friday she posted a brutally honest essay on her blog, The Anarchist Soccer Mom. It struck a nerve in the wake of the mass shooting in which 20 children died at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Over the weekend, it seemed, everybody was sharing the post and talking about The Anarchist Soccer Mom. Then came the backlash, as others criticized her for committing her son and writing about it publicly. Read more: The backlash against 'I am Adam Lanza's Mother' For Long, the blog post was ""a cry for help, a real gut-check article,"" she said, a way to articulate for friends the cold, gripping fear she has been living with for so long. She finally came to terms with an issue she'd been avoiding: Something serious is up with this boy. He goes into blind rages, he threatens violence and he is getting harder to control. She doesn't yet have a specific diagnosis, and she doesn't know what to do. ""He's in a good mood most of the time,"" she wrote. ""But when he's not, watch out. And it's impossible to predict what will set him off."" Read the complete blog post . On Wednesday, Long followed a social worker's advice and committed her son to an acute care psychiatric facility. During an argument over whether he could wear blue pants to school, he had threatened to kill himself by jumping out of the car. It was a line she'd warned him not to cross. A few weeks earlier, she called police when he pulled a knife, threatening to kill her and himself when he was asked to return overdue library books. He was strapped to a gurney and taken to a hospital emergency room, where he eventually calmed down. During the argument over the pants, he threw yet another ""full-blown fit,"" complete with screaming and hitting. ""I hugged him close, so he couldn't escape from the car,"" she wrote. ""He bit me several times and repeatedly jabbed his elbows into my rib cage. I'm still stronger than he is, but I won't be for much longer."" A psychiatric commitment is Idaho's temporary solution, lasting 10 to 14 days. After that, she says, her only other option is jail or juvenile detention. A leap of faith is required when listening to Long's heart-wrenching story because confidentiality laws surrounding mental health issues make it difficult if not impossible to verify. But Long provided details, including the names of the hospital and her son's school program, and offered to make copies of ambulance and hospital bills available. Shooter's mother struggled to raise son, relative says . ""No one wants to send a 13-year-old genius who loves Harry Potter and his snuggle animal collection to jail,"" she wrote in her blog. ""But our society, with its stigma on mental illness and its broken health care system, does not provide us with other options. Then another tortured soul shoots up a fast food restaurant. A mall. A kindergarten classroom. And we wring our hands and say, 'Something must be done.'"" Long says she has been told that her best option is to file criminal charges and build a paper trail. ""It's just total, total frustration,"" she said over the phone. ""Why are we doing this to the mentally ill? He's not a bad kid. He's a troubled kid. I just want to get help for my son."" ""Michael,"" as she calls him on the blog, is exceptionally bright, with an ""off-the-charts IQ."" But his temper had always gone far beyond the usual childhood tantrums. And his behavior grew stranger as he entered middle school. ""If I could, I would wish my son into normalcy by sheer force of will,"" Long said. ""I realized I was doing my family a disservice by thinking we were managing it. It's been so hard on them. These kids are just so hurt. It's really hurting our whole family. Frankly, I think my son is scared of himself."" Since committing him, she has visited her son daily. After the first day, Michael was angry and vengeful. After the second day, he started to calm down. By the third day ""he totally owned all the behavior,"" tearfully telling her, ""Mom, I'm scared, too."" In school shootings, patterns and warning signs . ""He does tend to forget about when he's violent,"" she explained. ""He sees red and then he's gone."" She added that she has told him about her viral blog post, which she titled ""Thinking the Unthinkable."" Others who picked it up, including the Huffington Post and Gawker, changed the headline to ""I am Adam Lanza's mother."" Long wrote that she thinks about her son every time there is a mass shooting. She fears that he might someday be capable of such explosive violence. ""I love my son. But he terrifies me,"" Long wrote. ""I am sharing this story because I am Adam Lanza's mother. I am Dylan Klebold's mother and Eric Harris' mother. I am James Holmes' mother. I am Jared Loughner's mother. I am Seun-Hui Cho's mother, "" she wrote, rattling off the names behind some of the nation's most notorious mass shootings: Sandy Hook Elementary School; Columbine High School; a crowded movie theater in Aurora, Colorado; a shopping center near Tucson, Arizona; Virginia Tech. ""And these boys -- and their mothers -- need help,"" she added. ""In the wake of another horrific national tragedy, it's easy to talk about guns. But it's time to talk about mental illness."" Long says Michael is a sweet boy most of the time. When he throws fits, he is so scary that she gathers up the knives, scissors and other sharp implements and keeps them with her in a plastic container. She says her other kids -- ages 15, 9 and 7 -- know the ""safety drill"" by heart: When Michael starts to go off, they run into the car and lock the doors. Thousands of people have posted comments on her blog -- nearly 3,000 by Monday night. Many of them thanked her, and said they were in similar situations. ""I am moved to tears because this is my story, too,"" one woman posted under the name ""Michigan Miss."" ""I can't believe it. You just described my brother!"" wrote ""Rachel."" ""I raised a boy like your 'Michael.' I get it. I so get it,"" wrote ""Lynne.""

In many of the posts, Kendzior notes, Long's ""allegedly insane and violent son is portrayed as a normal boy who incites her wrath by being messy, buying too many Apple products and supporting Obama."" Kendzior did not respond to an e-mail requesting comment, and by midafternoon it appeared the two bloggers had reached a truce. They posted a joint statement on both of their blogs: ""Whatever disagreements we have had, we both believe that the stigma attached to mental illness needs to end. We need to provide affordable, quality mental health care for families. We need to provide support for families who have a relative who is struggling."" Both agreed that privacy is paramount for family members, especially children. ""Neither of us anticipated the viral response to our posts,"" the statement continued. ""We are not interested in being part of a 'mommy war.' We are interested in opening a serious conversation on what can be done for families in need."" Long, who says she's ""kind of an introvert,"" hasn't owned a television set since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

"(CNN) -- As winter storms continue to pound the United States, causing billions in damage and millions to be without electricity service, customers inevitably ask why doesn't somebody -- my utility, my regulator, my government -- do something about this? Why aren't power lines, for example, buried safely underground? It's not that simple. The short answer? It is expensive, requires the buy-in of multiple entities that serve the community and doesn't always solve the problem. Because it costs so much to bury power lines, it's crucial that the expense yields value for electricity consumers, who will ultimately bear all the costs associated with providing electricity service. It's easy to see why a community under siege by intense weather would want to put the lines underground: Underground lines are protected from wind-related damage as well as ice and snow. But they also may be more vulnerable to damage from water intrusion. They're popular, too, in densely populated areas and new subdivisions where utility poles and a plethora of overhead lines would cause a kind of overhead congestion. As of 2012, about 39% of the customers in the United States reported having underground electricity service. But going underground can be difficult: In the electric utility business in the United States, it is nearly impossible for the utility, regulator or government to address the question of changing how power is delivered without the sign-on and cooperation of the others. Frum: Why we should bury the power lines . Let's start with the utility company: It is closest to the challenge, managing the electricity system, but cannot spend the money to change the power line configuration without the assurance from its regulator, whether it is the state public service commission or a city commission, that it will recover its investment through the rates it charges to its customers. For its part, the regulator cannot directly fix the power lines but still must ensure that any money the utility spends provides value for consumers. Finally, the government, or the other voice for the consumers, must determine whether consumers are willing to pay for such a change. (The state of Florida's reaction in the wake of the 2004-2005 hurricane seasons provides a model for this type of cooperative effort, as utilities, regulators and government officials meet every year to address the efficacy of Florida's storm hardening efforts, including the potential undergrounding of power lines.) Then there are two major challenges associated with relocating power lines underground: . First, it is very expensive. Burying power lines costs roughly $1 million per mile, but the geography or population density of the service area can halve this cost or triple it. In the wake of a statewide ice storm in December 2002, the North Carolina Utilities Commission and the electric utilities explored the feasibility of burying the state's distribution lines underground and concluded that the project would take 25 years and increase electricity rates by 125%. The project was never begun; the price increase was not seen as reasonable for the consumers. A 2010 study on undergrounding a portion of the electricity system in the District of Columbia for the Public Service Commission found that costs would increase rapidly as utilities tried to underground more of their service territory. The study concluded that a $1.1 billion (in 2006 dollars) investment could improve the reliability for 65% of the customers in the utility's service territory, but an additional $4.7 billion would be required to affect the remaining 35% of customers in outlying areas. That is, over 80% of the costs for the project would be required to benefit roughly one third of the customers. Burying the lines raises another potential problem: reduced accessibility of the lines, making it more difficult to repair the system. So while customers may see fewer outages as a result of undergrounding, the duration of those outages may increase. Electric users ask: Why not put power lines underground? Other benefits of undergrounding, such as aesthetic ones, may be more difficult to quantify, but studies have shown that consumers are sometimes willing to pay more for underground service. Second, burying power lines does not always protect them from storm damage. It may mitigate damage from wind events such as flying debris, falling trees and collected ice and snow, but so can trimming trees, replacing wood poles with steel, concrete or composite ones, or reinforcing poles with guy wires. These strategies may be nearly as effective in reducing storm damage and may cost less. Finally, undergrounding power lines only shifts the risk of damage from wind events to the risk of damage from corrosive storm surge and flooding that may result from rainfall or melting ice and snow. Areas with greater vulnerability to storm surge and flooding will confront systems that are less reliable -- and at greater cost - as a result of undergrounding. In short, whether a community should go underground with its power lines is a question to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the utility, its regulator and the government. Otherwise, consumers will end up spending more for their electricity service and getting less. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ted Kury.","Theodore Kury: When bad weather hits, people ask: Why not bury the power lines?
He says it appeals as way to prevent power outages, but difficulties include cost .
He says utility, regulators, government all must buy-in -- above-ground often easier .

"Cranston, Rhode Island (CNN) -- At a young age, Nicholas Lowinger learned not to take things for granted. He was 5 years old and visiting a homeless shelter with his mother, who works in various shelters across Rhode Island. He was excited for the opportunity to show off his new light-up sneakers to the rest of the kids. But his mom cautioned him against doing so, explaining that these children might not have such luxuries. Sure enough, when Nicholas met kids at the shelter, he quickly realized that they were living in circumstances that were very different from his own. ""I saw other kids my age who looked just like me. The only difference was, they were wearing old, tattered shoes that were falling apart. Some didn't have a pair of shoes to call their own,"" said Nicholas, now 15. ""I've been very fortunate to grow up in a family that is able to provide me with whatever I need. A lot of kids here in the U.S. don't have the same opportunities."" There were 1.6 million homeless children across the United States in 2010, according to a report from the National Center on Family Homelessness (PDF). With no permanent place to live, many stay on the streets or in shelters, motels, cars and abandoned buildings. ""Homeless children, they shouldn't have to worry about how they'll be accepted or how they'll fit in,"" Nicholas said. ""They shouldn't have to worry about not being able to play sports or go to school because they don't have a pair of shoes."" That first shelter visit left a strong impression on Nicholas, who started donating all the shoes he'd outgrown to local shelters. But he quickly realized that his donations, while well-intentioned, weren't that helpful. ""It bothered me that I only had used shoes to give to them instead of new shoes that fit right,"" he said. ""No two people's feet are identical, and if you are wearing someone else's worn shoes, your feet aren't going to be very comfortable."" So in 2010, at the age of 12, Nicholas started a program that donates new shoes to homeless children. At first, his efforts were part of a community service project leading up to his bar mitzvah, a Jewish coming-of-age ceremony. But he wanted to ensure that the work would continue after the ceremony. ""I didn't want to make one donation and stop there,"" he said. ""I wanted it to be something I could do for the rest of my life."" With the help of his parents, he then started the Gotta Have Sole Foundation. Since 2010, the organization has donated new footwear to more than 10,000 homeless children in 21 states. ""By giving new footwear to homeless children, I'm making sure them and their families have at least one less thing to worry about,"" Nicholas said. ""I'm also allowing parents to save money for an apartment or food for their next meal."" Two years ago, Frencis Velasquez found herself homeless with three young children. ""It's been difficult. Going from shelter to shelter, meeting all these different people. My kids didn't have anything that was stable,"" said Velasquez, 23. Keeping up with the demanding needs of her growing children presented additional challenges. ""I had to decide either to spend money on shoes or medicine and diapers,"" Velasquez said. ""I already felt horrible. Not being able to provide them shoes made me feel even worse."" Fortunately, the Rhode Island shelter where she was living worked with the Gotta Have Sole Foundation. Her children have now received multiple pairs of shoes through the organization. ""Having new shoes makes them feel great,"" Velasquez said. ""I remember when one of my sons got his first pair, he was so excited that he just started kissing the shoes. It makes me feel awesome just knowing that they're happy."" Since starting this work, Nicholas has heard many emotional stories. He remembers one 16-year-old boy who had fled an abusive living situation with his mother. They had to make a quick escape, so the boy put on the first shoes he could get his hands on: a pair of his mother's old winter boots. With no other shoes, the boy had to wear the boots day in and day out. Not only were they the wrong size, but his classmates made fun of him for wearing women's shoes. The boots became a constant source of embarrassment and discomfort until he received new footwear from Nicholas' nonprofit. ""New shoes can make a child feel good about him or herself. ... They gain confidence; they're able to do better in school,"" Nicholas said. Nicholas also remembers a brother and sister who had to share one pair of sparkly pink sneakers. Each day, the siblings switched off wearing the sneakers. When one went to school, the other had to miss a day. The children fell behind in their studies until they each received a new pair of shoes from Nicholas' group. ""Something that seems so simple, a pair of shoes, made the difference between getting an education or not,"" Nicholas said. ""It's more than just giving them a new pair of shoes. ... That's really what makes it so special for me."" The Lowinger family's garage is full of new shoes that have been donated by footwear companies and stores. If they don't already have the specific size and style that a child has requested, Nicholas uses the group's monetary donations to buy them. The shoes are then shipped to the shelters or, whenever possible, personally delivered by Nicholas. More than 1,000 volunteers have helped out with the group. Nicholas works 15 hours a week on the project -- a time limit imposed by his mother to ensure that he has enough time for schoolwork and other activities. Nicholas said he doesn't allow his age get in the way of achieving his dreams, and he encourages other young people to do the same. ""No one is ever too young or old to help others. Kids don't always realize that they have the power to make a difference,"" he said. ""I urge other kids to find a passion, create big ideas and act. Kids can make a huge difference in this world.""

"(CNN) -- A U.S. filmmaker arrested in Venezuela and accused of instigating unrest was released from prison and expelled from the country, his attorney told CNN affiliate Globovision. Timothy Tracy was on a flight to Miami Wednesday morning, attorney Daniel Rosales said. Tracy, 35, of Los Angeles, was arrested in April at the Caracas airport as he prepared to leave the country. He was accused of funding opponents of President Nicolas Maduro, successor to the late Hugo Chavez. His lawyer said he was released because there was not sufficient evidence to hold him. Venezuelan Minister of Interior and Justice Miguel Rodriguez confirmed the release on his Twitter account, but maintained that Tracy was ""captured doing espionage in our country."" The filmmaker was in Venezuela to make a documentary about the political division gripping the country. Press freedom groups and the U.S. government denied that Tracy was involved in any anti-government activities. ""Tracy was just acting as an observer when he was filming,"" Reporters Without Borders said when he was arrested. ""Shooting video is not evidence of participation in what the government calls an 'act of destabilization.' It is for the police and judicial authorities to investigate and establish from the facts, not for the government to designate Tracy as guilty from the outset.""","Timothy Tracy was accused of fomenting unrest in Venezuela .

"(CNN) -- On safari in Europe? Surely the place has been settled too long for that -- roads and real estate must have edged out the wild creatures that once roamed the continent. Not entirely. With an intrepid spirit -- and a dose of patience -- you'll find big game experiences from the Arctic Circle to the shores of the Mediterranean. Polar bear (Norway) Not many places in the world make you carry a gun when you're leaving town. Svalbard, Norway's frozen northernmost territory, does. Anyone leaving a settlement is required by law to carry a rifle in case they need to kill a polar bear in self-defense. The world's largest land carnivore, polar bears prey mainly on ringed seals, but without a bear-sized gun you could become a snack. Midway between Norway and the North Pole, Svalbard is an archipelago of black rock, snow and glaciers surrounded by ice floes. It's hard to believe that anything could live here, but these islands and the waters around them are home to about 3,000 polar bears. They spend much of their time at sea, so it's often best (and safest) to see them from a boat. Plenty of companies offer boat trips in small expedition vessels from Longyearbyen, Svalbard's main town, including Nordic Visitor and Spitsbergen Travel. Bear sightings are almost guaranteed, with basking walruses a bonus. When to go: midsummer, when 24 hours of daylight give you plenty of time to see bears and other wildlife. Rifle rental costs around $30 per day from adventure travel stores on Longyearbyen's main street. You need special permission from the Governor of Svalbard or a weapon license to carry a rifle. SAS and Norwegian fly to Longyearbyen from Oslo. More information from Visit Norway. Moose (Sweden) Sweden: moose capital of the world. The country has more of the creatures per square kilometer than anywhere else in the world. Despite the best efforts of Swedish hunters, around 250,000 moose (more often known as elk in Europe) roam the country's forests. In autumn, they sometimes wander into towns and villages, drunk on fermented apples. The rest of the time, moose can be hard to find, blending into their native habitat with surprising ease for such a large animal. One of the best places to see them is the Bergslagen forest (wolves and beaver also inhabit the forest), two hours' drive from Stockholm. From the Kolarbyn Eco Lodge (Skarsjon, 73992 Skinnskatteberg; +46 70 400 7053) -- billed in self-deprecating style as ""Sweden's most primitive hotel"" -- you can set off on a twilight moose-spotting walk with every chance of seeing groups of up to 20 of the magnificent beasts. When to go: August-September is the best time to see big bull with mighty antlers. Getting there: Skinskatteberg train station is two kilometers from the eco-lodge. Lynx (Spain) Fewer than 250 Iberian lynx survive in the wild -- most in the Mediterranean forests of the Sierra Morena, in Andalusia, and in the grasslands and pine woods of the Coto Donana, close to the mouth of the River Guadalquivir. You need to spend up to a week (and rise before dawn) in the Sierra de Andujar Natural Park or the Donana National Park to maximize your chances of seeing Europe's only big cat. If lynx fail to show up, you may see mouflon, red and fallow deer, wild boar and spectacular birds, including black vulture, griffon vulture, imperial eagle and -- in the coastal wetlands of the Coto Donana -- flamingos. When to go: all year. Sierra de Andujar Natural Park Visitor Center, Las Vinas de Penallana, kilometer 13, Highway A6177, approximately 100 kilometers east of Cordoba; +34 953 549 030 . Coto Donana National Park Visitor Center, La Rocina, approximately 130 kilometers southwest of Seville; +34 959 442 340 . Wild horses, wild cattle (Netherlands) It's a bizarre sight. In a feral enclave surrounded by the most artificial landscape in Europe -- those parts of the Netherlands reclaimed from the sea -- thousands of wild horses, red deer and Heck cattle roam. An expanse of almost 60 square kilometers of meadows and wetlands, Oostvardersplassen is the result of ""rewilding"" an area of land reclaimed from the sea that was originally zoned for industry. When the original plans remained undeveloped, Dutch scientists introduced deer, konik (""little ponies"") from Poland and Heck cattle. The last are relics of a 20th-century German attempt to recreate the giant aurochs of northern Europe, extinct since the 17th century. Vast flocks of graylag geese add to the feeling that you're deep in the wilderness. In fact, you're just more than 60 kilometers from Amsterdam. When to go: all year, but best in spring and autumn. Oostvardersplassen Visitor Centre, Kitsweg 1, 8218 AA Lelystad; +31 320 254 585; visit by guided walking tour only. Getting there: Almere Oostvardes train station is two kilometers from the visitor center. Bison (Poland, Belarus) Straddling the border between northeast Poland and Belarus, the Bialowieza forest is Europe's last remaining expanse of primeval woodland. It's home to the only wild herd of European bison, also called wisent or, in Polish, zubr. About 450 of these huge, shaggy beasts live in Bialowieza National Park (+48 85 682 9700) on the Polish side of the border, where they plod through snow-covered meadows in winter and graze on bison grass in summer. The forest is also home to elk, red and roe deer, wild boar, wolf, beaver and lynx -- but the bison is the big ticket attraction. When to go: all year round, but best between May and September. Getting there: Bialowieza is about 260 kilometers (4 hours, 20 minutes' drive) east of Warsaw. By rail to Hajnowka, then bus to Bialowieza village. Mouflon (Corsica) Corsica's rugged, sparsely populated interior provides a refuge for one of Europe's most striking mountain mammals: the mouflon. Much of the island's fierce hinterland is contained within the Natural Regional Park of Corsica, where maquis scrub and high pine forests provide a refuge for the endemic wild sheep that's the island's emblem. Beneath the towering 2,710-meter summit of Mt. Cinio, the high alpine meadows of the Asco Valley are home to Corsica's biggest mouflon population. When to go: spring and autumn. Maison du Mouflon et de la Nature, Mairie d'Asco, Asco; +33 495 47 82 07; about 70 kilometers west of Bastia . Brown bear (Finland) The swathes of uninhabited taiga along Finland's border with Russia are the best place in Europe to see brown bear close up. In summer, you can hope to see as many as 20 bears in one night at the Martinselkosen Wilds Center (Pirttivaarantie 131, Ruhtinansalmi; +358 8736 160) -- wolf and wolverine are sometimes seen here, too. Females with cubs make their appearance in June, adolescents turn up throughout the summer, big males come and go. You'll be watching at night from a carefully camouflaged (and comfortable) hide. Bears are likely to be 10-30 meters away from you, but with luck -- and if you stay quiet and still -- they may come closer. When to go: May to mid-August. Getting there: flights and trains from Helsinki to Kajaani, 160 kilometers south of Pirttivaarantie.","Spotting polar bear in Norway's Svalbard, you have to carry a rifle by law .

"East Rutherford, New Jersey (CNN) -- His pick to win the big game may have lost Sunday, but 14-year-old Isaac Lufkin is still smiling after a once-in-a-lifetime trip to the Super Bowl. Isaac and his mom Lori were guests of the National Football League and got to experience America's premier sporting event behind the scenes as a VIP. We first told you about Isaac last week. He was born without arms, but that hasn't stopped him from being place kicker for his Classical High School freshman football team in Providence, Rhode Island. In fact, he helped lead his team to an undefeated 2013 season and the freshman football state title. Isaac's passion for football is clear, but when you watch him kick it's more than passion. It's proof that almost anything is possible. ""I wanna play in the NFL. The (Baltimore) Ravens,"" Isaac told CNN as he practiced his kicking on the Classical High School football field. His determination and fiercely independent spirit caught the attention of many people -- including the NFL -- after CNN's ""The Situation Room"" aired his story last week. At MetLife Stadium he got to go on the field before the game to watch the players warm up, he shook hands with superstar actors and was feted in a luxury box. And then President Bill Clinton stopped by to say hello. ""It was the best honor that has ever been bestowed on me,"" Isaac said. What did the 42nd president say? ""He told me I should keep on kicking."" Sounds like good advice. Helping amputee athletes get back on track . 'Pity just makes me weaker' Several doors have opened for the ninth grader. There have been invitations to be on reality shows and kicking camps and football coaches have reached out. And of course, Facebook friend requests that have been so numerous, Isaac says he's had to set up a second Facebook page. His mother, Lori, told CNN the attention has been ""overwhelming, but in a positive way ... I went from mom who wants everybody to see my son the way I do to OK, mom is super secretary."" Despite all the attention Isaac has gotten, she said, ""He needs to prove to me academically that he can finish high school with a great GPA. Because the only way he is going to play for the NFL is if he does have one, so education is No. 1 right now."" You may wonder why Isaac doesn't have prosthetic arms. Dr. Michael Nunnery, who has been Isaac's prosthetist since he was a toddler, said artificial limbs wouldn't necessarily improve Isaac's quality of life right now. Isaac has become so capable and flexible on his own -- able to type, play video games, eat and dress himself with his feet -- prosthetic arms may hinder that. Nunnery says having prosthetic arms would certainly make kicking harder for Isaac by throwing off his balance. As for Isaac, he is adamant he wants to do everything on his own. ""I don't like pity. Pity just makes me weaker,"" he said. He added that he understands if someone wants to pick up his backpack if he drops it, but he's just going to put it back on the floor and pick it up himself to prove his independence. ""I look forward 20 years and I'm on my own, and I have my own house,"" he envisioned. ""Who's going to help me? My mom's gone. Who's going to help me? I'll just be sitting on my bed in the same clothes. Never being able to brush my teeth or my hair or washing it. No, that's not a life for me."" Thought -powered bionic arm allows amputee to play piano . Not a soccer fan . For now, Isaac's dreaming of finishing his high school football career undefeated for the next three years, then making his way to the NFL. He wants to keep wearing purple, but one day as a player for the Ravens. Isaac lead his division in onside kicks that were recovered this season and he didn't back off on his other kickoffs. Watch game tape and you'll see him plowing into the scrums to assist on a tackle. He told the Providence Journal, who first reported this story, that he tried soccer and it wasn't for him. ""I played a lot of soccer, but I'm not a good soccer player,"" he told the newspaper. ""I'm too aggressive. I like contact."" He hopes his Classical teammates, and others, will be inspired when they see him out on the field. There are no excuses, he said, no way they can be lazy. ""If I can kick a ball and set it up and do my own thing, then they can do their own thing,"" he told CNN. On Sunday, you could see that Isaac wanted to go on the field at MetLife Stadium and have a kick. ""I couldn't stop smiling and I still can't stop smiling. It's exciting. Very exciting,"" he said. That smiled remained even as he watched the Broncos and Peyton Manning come up short against the Seattle Seahawks. He made a prediction. He would be back at the Super Bowl one day. It might be a good distance down the road, but he was positive he would get there. ""No doubt,"" he said. Never say 'I can't'","The NFL invited Isaac Lufkin and his mom to be its guests at the Super Bowl .

"York and Leicester, England (CNN) -- A year ago, historians held their breath as archaeologist Jo Appleby painstakingly dusted centuries of dirt and debris from the curved spine and staved-in skull of a skeleton uncovered under a parking lot in the English city of Leicester. The story of the long-lost king buried beneath a car park made headlines around the world -- but 12 months on, excitement has given way to anger, as enthusiasts and experts argue over what should happen to Richard III's remains. The once-missing monarch -- best known as the Shakespearean villain accused of murdering his nephews, the Princes in the Tower, to take the throne -- faces one final battle before he can be left to rest in peace: the increasingly bitter fight over where his bones (minus his feet, lost at some point during the past 500 years) will be interred. The judge in the case, Mr. Justice Haddon-Cave has even gone so far as to plead with all concerned ""to avoid embarking on the (legal) Wars of the Roses, part two,"" warning that such legal wrangling would be ""unseemly, undignified and unedifying,"" and urging them to call in an independent panel of experts to rule on the burial. The original War of the Roses was a bloody civil war which divided England for decades, and eventually saw Richard's family, the Plantagenets, swept from power. While the experts who carried out the search for Richard III's remains are keen to see him reinterred in Leicester, others believe it was the medieval king's wish to be buried in York -- the city they claim was closest to his heart. English rules and regulations governing exhumations should mean that the decision is a straightforward one -- such bodies are usually reburied in the nearest consecrated ground to the archaeological dig site -- but in fact it is proving anything but, with the launch of legal action to try and halt the plans. Read more: Richard III had worms, scientists say . Those behind the project had always planned for any bodies they uncovered in their search for Leicester's long-lost Greyfriars Friary to be reburied at the city's cathedral, just a stone's throw away from the now-famous car park. Back then Richard Buckley, lead archaeologist on what he admits to initially thinking of as a ""harebrained scheme,"" told CNN how he had applied for a license to exhume any human remains with the words ""In the unlikely event that we find the remains of Richard III..."" But it is this very license that now finds itself at the center of a court battle between the authorities in Leicester and a group calling itself the Plantagenet Alliance, who say more thought should have gone into the reburial. The Alliance -- made up of people who claim to be distantly related to Richard III, and headed by Stephen Nicolay, his 17th great nephew -- objects to the lack of consultation over where the newly-rediscovered king's bones should be laid to rest. They say that given the remains' royal status, it should not be a simple case of ""finders keepers."" Instead, they believe that the location of the new grave should be up for discussion. ""What we're saying is that for a significant historical figure such as Richard III, his remains should be the subject of a broad consultation,"" explains Matthew Howarth, the lawyer representing the Alliance. ""All the interested parties should be able to have their say, state their case as to where the bones should be buried... It shouldn't be a closed decision."" Read more: New coffin mystery at Richard III site . The Alliance eventually wants to see the bones taken to York, a northern city packed to the gills with historic sites and, the group says, with links to Richard III. It is a plea backed up by others in the city. ""Richard was the last northern king,"" explains Paul Toy, of York's Richard III Museum. ""He had lots of estates and he was constantly moving around, but certainly he would identify himself as northern, and York was a city that was very close to his heart... He was very much part of the civic fabric."" By contrast, say the ""Yorkists,"" the ill-fated monarch had little or no connection to Leicester -- other than the fact he was slung into a hastily-dug grave there following his death at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. Not true, say those in the Leicester camp. ""There's considerable historical evidence that Richard spent quite a lot of time at his castle here in Leicester,"" says the city's mayor, Peter Soulsby. ""It was from Leicester that he chose to ride out to what would prove to be his last battle, and it was to Leicester that he was returned, and where he was buried on the orders of the new king, Henry. ""And frankly, to be buried by royal command in a city is pretty powerful evidence that this is where he ought to remain."" Read more: Is this the face that launched 1,000 myths? Soulsby insists that the events of more recent times offer all the more reason for the monarch to be laid to rest in Leicester. ""Leicester's people have honored Richard for many generations: We have a King Richard's Road, a King Richard's School, we even have pubs called after King Richard. ""It's not just the history that compels us -- it is also the fact that it was the amazing skill of Leicester University's archaeologists that actually rediscovered the remains, and their incredible forensic work that confirmed they were the remains of King Richard. ""Leicester is where he's been for 500 years, and Leicester is where he deserves to be reburied, with proper ceremony, and in a tomb fit for a king."" Indeed, the city is speeding full-steam ahead with plans for a new tomb in the cathedral, where a memorial stone has long paid tribute to the last Plantagenet king, and for a visitor center on the site of the Greyfriars car park, telling the story of Richard's life, his death, and his rediscovery. The council has already bought an old school which is being turned into a museum, and it is clear that there is a commercial aspect to the battle for the bones, since whichever city they end up in is likely to see a tourism boost.

The Plantagenet Alliance, though, insist that money has nothing to do with their case. ""My clients have no commercial interest in it,"" says Howarth. ""They won't gain out of any tourism, but they have a very strong view that Richard's links to the north of England, and to York in particular, mean that he should be buried here."" For Toy, it comes down to the question of what the king himself would have wanted. ""As far as we can tell, as far as we have any idea of where he wanted to be buried himself, it seems to be in York,"" he told CNN. ""There's a sense that Richard III is a king who has had a bad press -- an unfair bad press -- and that responding as far as we can to his known wishes would slightly even things up a bit.""

"(CNN) -- Five people have been killed after one of the Philippines' most active volcanoes spewed a giant cloud of ash and rocks early Tuesday. They were climbing on Mount Mayon, some 212 miles (340 km) southeast of Manila, when the blast occurred at around 8 a.m. local time, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC). Of the five fatalities, four were German tourists, while the other was identified as Jerome Berin, their Filipino guide, the NDRRMC said. Joey Salceda, governor of Albay Province, told CNN affiliate ABS-CBN they were killed after being hit by falling rocks. He said they were part of a larger group scaling the volcano. Seven others, including an Australian, were hurt. The NDRRMC said a total of 27 hikers were on the volcano at the time and requested assistance. iReport: Volcano sends ash soaring into sky . According to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, the blast sent a thick column of ash 500 meters (1,600 feet) into the air -- the result of what it called a ""small phreatic event"" that lasted about 73 seconds. While no intensification of volcanic activity was observed, it warned that these sudden ash and steam explosions could occur at any time. Therefore officials advised people against going inside a six-kilometer danger zone around the volcano. Mount Mayon is the most volatile of more than 50 volcanoes -- 22 of which are considered active -- that are scattered across the Philippine archipelago. An almost perfect cone shape, Mayon last erupted in 2010 and forced thousands of people to flee from their homes. Mayon's slopes, like many volcanoes in the country, are home to thousands of farming communities who make use of the fertile soils provided by the volcanic activity despite the occasional risk of eruption.","Five climbers killed during ash explosion on volcano in Philippines .

"(CNN) -- Athletes will use rifles, stones, skis and blades Monday in their quest for Olympic glory. Here are five things to look for on the fifth day of the Sochi Winter Olympics: . Biathlon . Keep an eye on Norway's Ole Einar Bjoerndalen, the Michael Phelps of the Winter Games. He competes in the biathlon, in which cross country skiers pause at appointed spots to shoot rifles at targets. The sport has origins in the hunting practices of northern Europeans. Bjoerndalen, 40, became the oldest individual gold medalist in Winter Games history on Saturday by winning the men's biathlon 10km sprint. He tied cross country skier Bjorn Daehlie of Norway for a record 12 Olympic Winter medals. He could become the outright record-holder if he wins a 13th medal Monday in the men's12.5-km pursuit. Who else to watch: Dominik Landertinger of Austria and Jaroslav Soukup of Czech Republic have the second and third starting positions behind Bjoerndalen. Emil Hegle Svendsen of Norway has won world titles in all the biathlon events. Curling . For people who don't know anything about winter sports, curling is a hoot. It's a lot like shuffleboard on ice, relying on strategy more than strength or quickness. Two teams of four players each slide heavy polished stones across the ice toward a circular target. Points are scored by placing stones closest to the center of the target. The U.S. men will compete against Norway. The United States won bronze at the 2006 games but finished poorly in 2010. Team members John Shuster and Jeff Isaacson competed in the 2006 and 2010 Winter Games for the United States. The U.S. women will face Switzerland on Monday. One of the United States' top players is Ericka Brown, 41, who comes from a curling family. Her husband, father, mother and brother have all competed on the Olympic or national level. Who else to watch: Canada has dominated men's curling for the past decade and won gold at the 2010 games in Vancouver. Sweden won gold for the women at the last Olympics. Women's Alpine Skiing . Tina Weirather of Liechtenstein hopes to follow in her mother's ski tracks. Mom Hanni Wenzel won gold in the alpine skiing slalom at Lake Placid in 1980, making her the only woman from Liechtenstein to ever win an Olympic gold medal. Two of the five alpine skiing events will take place Monday. In the downhill, the athletes will cover the longest distance of any event and hit the highest speeds, sometimes close to 75 mph (120 kph). In the slalom, athletes ski through a course marked with tightly placed flags and gates. Who else to watch: Maria Hoefl-Riesch of Germany won gold in two events at the 2010 games. Teenager Mikaela Shiffrin of the United States is a favorite in the slalom. Short track skating . This is one of the Winter Games' newest and most exciting events. It didn't become an official Olympic competition until 1992. With extremely tight turns, each race presents the possibility of collisions and spills. Charles Hamelin of Canada is the favorite to win the 1,500 meters. In the 2010 games at Vancouver, he won gold in the 500-meter event as well as the 5,000-meter relay. Viktor Ahn of Russia could also win the event. J.R. Celski of the United States won bronze in 2010 and is a threat. The Olympic races include 500m, 1000m, and 1500m races (for both men and women), and relay races at 3000m (women) and 5000m (men). Who else to watch: Some other contenders in the 1,500 include Lee Han-Bin and Sin Da Woon, both of Korea. Freestyle skiing . This is going to get bumpy. In perhaps the most jarring of all winter sports, mogul skiers try to fly through a course while bouncing over huge mounds of snow. Oh, and they throw in some flips and aerial turns in between, too. On Monday, a new king of the mounds will be crowned. Canada's Mikael Kingsbury is a favorite to win the gold. The 21-year-old has been skiing moguls since he was 8 years old. Who else to watch: Another Canadian, Alex Bilodeau, and American Patrick Deneen are also strong contenders.","Keep an eye on Ole Einar Bjoerndalen, the Michael Phelps of the Winter Games .

"(CNN) -- Austria's Matthias Mayer scored an upset victory in the blue riband men's downhill while hosts Russia claimed its first gold of the Winter Games in Sochi Sunday in a packed program of competition. The 23-year-old Mayer recovered from a slow start on the treacherous piste at Rosa Khutor to claim gold with a time of two minutes 06.23 seconds. Italian Christof Innerhofer took silver, just six-hundredths of a second behind, with Norway's Kjetil Jansrud in the bronze medal position. BLOG: Sunday's action live . Pre-race favorites Bode Miller of the United States and world downhill champion Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway, finished eighth and fourth respectively. The 36-year-old Miller, in his final Olympics, had been quickest in two training runs, but mistakes on the middle section of the course, cost him dear. ""I wanted to ski it as hard as I could and not really back off, but it requires a lot of tactics today which I didn't apply,"" he said. ""I feel disappointed. I skied hard and well, and that's the most important thing. It just didn't go all right."" By contrast, Mayer, who chose the perfect moment to win his first major downhill competition, was in dreamland. ""This is unbelievable. I thought maybe in a few years I could dream of this sort of achievement. It was really cool and my family will be excited,"" was his assessment. Mayer's father Helmut won a silver medal in the super-G discipline at Calgary in 1988 and his son had a pre-race premonition he could go one better. ""I woke up this morning and I knew that I could win this race. I was smiling the whole day, all throughout the inspection. It was my day today,"" he added. The alpine skiing hotbed of Austria has not produced an Olympic downhill champion since Fritz Stroebl in the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City and Mayer is following in the footsteps of legends such as Franz Klammer, the 1976 gold medalist in Innsbruck. Innerhofer looked like spoiling the Austrian party as he bettered Mayer's time in the upper sections, but he narrowly missed out in one of the tightest finishes in Olympic downhill history. ""It has been a big dream for me to win a medal at the Olympic Games, so I can't really believe it,"" admitted a stunned Innerhofer. ""I couldn't be happier."" Svindal, so dominant on the World Cup circuit, was distraught to finish outside of a podium places by just 0.19 seconds. ""It is pretty much the worst place to be. I've been there before and probably will be again,"" the 31-year-old said. Svindal took silver in the downhill in Vancouver 2010 behind Switzerland's Didier Defago, who was only 14th in his title defense in Sochi. The classic downhill opened proceedings on the second day of finals, while Russia's figure skaters rounded off the day by clinching the team competition -- watched by President Vladimir Putin. Veteran Yevgeny Plushenko and 15-year-old Julia Lipnitskaia won their respective free skate competitions at the Iceberg Skating Palace to give Russia an unassailable lead ahead of the ice dance free dance later in the evening. ""I'm 31 years and this means everything to me. It's so much history,"" said Plushenko, who was the 2006 Olympic champion and has won two silver medals in a glittering career. The new sport of slopestyle snowboarding has proved a big hit with spectators and television viewers and earlier Jamie Anderson completed a double for the United States. Her teammate Sage Kutsenburg won the men's event Saturday and she followed it up with a superb display in the women's final. Her massive score of 95.25 proved a class apart with Finland's Enni Rukajarvi in second place on 92.50 with Britain's Jenny Jones taking the bronze. The third gold medal of the day went to Dario Cologna, who won the Skiathlon 15km classic/15km freestyle event in Nordic Skiing. Cologna suffered an ankle injury at the start of the season and did not race until last month, but it did not prevent the Swiss, who won gold in the 2010 Winter Games, doubling up. ""It's great -- a dream come true. The second gold after Vancouver. It's very special,"" he said. The first medal for Russia came as Olga Graf took bronze in the women's 3,000m speed skating. Ireen Wust maintained the early Dutch dominance in speed skating at Sochi by taking gold from silver medalist Martina Sablikova of the Czech Republic. In the 7.5km sprint biathlon, defending champion Anastasiya Kuzmina of Slovakia took gold ahead of Russian hope Olga Vilukhina. Russian-born Kuzmina claimed gold in the sprint and silver in the 10km pursuit at Vancouver in 2010. Germany's Felix Loch dominated the men's luge from start to finish to take gold with a combined time of three minutes 27.526 seconds over the four runs. Russian Albert Demchenko was left frustrated in his bid to become the oldest-ever Olympic champion at the age of 42, but took a fine silver. Double Olympic champion Armin Zoeggler of Italy took bronze in a high-quality competition. Poland's Kamil Stoch took the ski jumping title on the normal hill Sunday with jumps of 105.5m and 103.5m for a total of 278 points. Slovenia's Peter Prevc was second, nearly 13 points adrift with Norway's Anders Bardal taking the final podium spot. Switzerland's Simon Ammann, 32, double Olympic champion in 2006 and 2010, finished back in 17th.","Austria's Matthias Mayer wins men's downhill .

"(CNN) -- There was heartbreak for the U.S. women's ice hockey team as Canada snatched a dramatic 3-2 victory in overtime of the Olympic final at the Bolshoy Ice Dome on Thursday. The Americans were on course to avenge their final defeat to Canada four years ago after Meghan Duggan opened the scoring midway through the second period, and Alex Carpenter doubled the advantage two minutes into the third. But the defending champions refused to give up and were rewarded for their persistence with a goal from Brianne Jenner with three and a half minutes of normal time remaining. The Canadians threw caution to the wind and pulled off goaltender Shannon Szabados, but had a lucky escape when a long-distance U.S. effort bounced safely off the post -- and Marie-Philip Poulin stole in for a last-gasp equalizer with just 55 seconds left to send the match into overtime. Poulin then popped up with the golden goal in the ninth extra minute to seal an incredible comeback and Canada's fourth straight Olympic gold in women's ice hockey. In the bronze playoff match, Switzerland beat Sweden 4-3. Sweden had also been leading 2-0 in their match but the Swiss rallied in the third to claim a first ever Olympic women's hockey medal -- the winner coming courtesy of 15-year-old Alina Muller. Elsewhere on Day 13 in Sochi, the French claimed an historic first and there was ice dance drama as five other gold medals were decided. Kim denied gold . Adelina Sotnikova skated into Olympic history at the Iceberg Skating Palace on Thursday as she claimed Russia's historic first women's Olympic figure skating gold. The 17-year-old's victory was controversial though after judges awarded her the evening's best score despite an error in her routine. ""I smashed my season's best. In fact, I smashed my highest score for my whole career and I did it at the Olympics. I didn't think I could skate like I did today,"" Sotnikova said. Read more: Ice queens do battle one final time . ""I found something totally different in myself today. I had a bit of nerves before I skated but just before I started I was completely calm. I just felt how much I love to skate. I think I found a new me."" Defending champion Kim Yu-Na from South Korea produced an error-free performance but had to settle for silver after leading the standings following Wednesday's short program. Speaking after the competition, Kim said that she hadn't seen her rivals compete because she was the last to skate and refused to be drawn on the scoring. ""The scores are given by the judges so I'm not in the right position to comment and there is nothing that will change with my words. The most important thing for me is to participate in these Games,"" she said. Italy's Carolina Kostner, who also put in a flawless routine, took the bronze. ""I just have faith that the judges made the right decision,"" said Kostner, the 2012 world champion. Sotnikova's gold was Russia's third in the ice skating after Tatiana Volosozhar and Maxim Trankov won the pairs in the opening week following glory in the team competition. Bowman remembers Burke . Up in the mountain cluster, Maddie Bowman took gold for the U.S. in the freestyle skiing halfpipe competition. The 20-year-old Californian's winning score of 89.00 was too good for France's Marie Martinod, whose second run score of 85.40 meant she had to settle for silver. Japan's Ayana Onozuka took bronze with a second run score of 83.20 to keep reigning world champion Virginie Faivre from Switzerland off the podium in fourth place. Afterwards, Bowman dedicated her victory to the late Sarah Burke -- the Canadian freestyle skier who died in a training accident at Park City in Utah in 2012. ""Gosh, it means so much for us to be able to show the world what our sport is, what we do and what we are,"" Bowman said. ""I think we're here to make our parents proud, our friends proud and especially Sarah Burke proud, because she is here with us. ""I think her lasting legacy is just to go out, ski as hard as you can, love what you do and love life. Sarah did that. ""She was an amazing skier but she was an amazing person. I think every girl here would embody that and it takes all of us to put on her shoes."" French sweep board in men's ski cross . A thrilling skicross competition at the Rosa Khutor Extreme Park ended with France taking a clean sweep of the podium. Reigning world champion Jean-Frederic Chapuis added Olympic gold to his collection after beating compatriots Arnaud Bovolenta, who took silver, and third-placed Jonathan Midol. The result sealed France's first 1-2-3 at a Winter Olympics. Canada's Brady Leman had to settle for fourth after falling before the penultimate jump. ""My goal was to make the podium,"" said Chapuis. ""I worked really hard throughout the summer. I had a good start to the season, after I was a little bit tired and the rest was not so good. But I trained again, I came back here with good form and I made it,"" the 24-year-old added. ""I'm better year after year. I make progress always. When I started ski cross my goal was the Olympic Games here in Sochi and I am happy with that."" Russia's Egor Korotkov finished fifth after crossing the line first in the small final. Korotkov had earlier been involved in a memorable finish in the first quarterfinal heat. The 27-year-old crossed the line head first to claim second in a photo finish ahead of Sweden's Victor Oehling Norberg and Jouni Pellinen of Finland. All three riders crashed on landing off the final jump leading to a mad seated scramble for the finish line. Tenth gold for Norway . Norway consolidated its place as the overall gold-medal leader Thursday after edging out Germany to win the Nordic combined team relay competition. The event -- in which teams of four complete one jump each on the large hill before skiing a 4x5-kilometer relay -- went down to the wire as Joergen Graabak finished a second ahead of Germany's Fabian Riessle in a nailbiting climax. Austria finished third to take the bronze. Graabak's second gold of the Games -- the 22-year-old won the 10 km sprint on Tuesday -- capped another good day for Norway, which now has 10 gold medals after making a slow start in Sochi. ""It was like two days ago, about being first into the stadium,"" Graabak said. ""I wasn't planning on going first in the first lap, but I think the two guys behind me were a bit scared and didn't want to go first, so I took it a bit easy and saved myself for the sprint at the end. ""I saw behind me that Riessle was throwing his foot forward, but I was confident that I was first."" Curling gold for Canada's ladies . Canada claimed its first Olympic women's curling gold since the Nagano Games in 1998, as a 6-3 defeat of Sweden avenged a heart-breaking 7-6 loss to the Scandinavians four years ago in Vancouver. The Swedes were gunning for a third successive gold in Sochi but had to settle for silver after the Canadian team led by skip Jennifer Jones produced a composed display in the Ice Cube Curling Center. ""It's just crazy. It's a dream come true. It's just amazing. We just had the best week of our lives. We are gold medalists,"" Jones said. The Canadians, unbeaten throughout the tournament, also have the distinction of winning a medal at every Winter Games since curling was made an official sport in 1998. In the third-place playoff, Great Britain beat Switzerland 6-5 to claim a bronze medal. Britain's men take to the ice on Friday in the gold medal match against Canada, with China and Sweden battling out for the bronze.","Canada claim golden goal to snatch women's ice hockey gold from U.S.

"(CNN) -- No Googling allowed: . Who are Koichi Wakata, Oleg Kotov, Mike Hopkins, Mikhail Tyurin, Rick Mastracchio and Sergey Ryazanskiy? If you're stumped by the question, don't feel bad. You're not alone. Most people almost certainly wouldn't know the answer. Although it would be nice if we did. Those six men are people of great accomplishment, rigorous education and training, and astonishing courage. Right this moment, they are taking part in something so thrilling that it's hard to believe the world has become so indifferent to it. They are the six inhabitants of the International Space Station. Living together hundreds of miles above the surface of the Earth, they circle the globe every 90 minutes. They travel at a speed of 17,500 miles per hour every second of every day. But except when there is a potential crisis on the Space Station, such as the problem with the cooling system over the holidays, most people are barely aware that they are up there. Their mission is like something Ian Fleming would have dreamed up in an old James Bond novel: . Five different space agencies from nations across the Earth, cooperating to populate and support a self-contained outpost -- a colony the size of a football field -- that circles endlessly above us at unimaginable velocity. An international team of intrepid explorers living in space, conducting experiments and research and gazing through the blackness toward the rest of us. The International Space Station has been continuously occupied by different teams of astronauts and cosmonauts for more than 13 years. Americans once knew by heart the names of the original astronauts. Alan Shepard, John Glenn, Gus Grissom and their colleagues were as celebrated as any baseball heroes had been in generations that preceded theirs. Life on Earth came to a complete, pulse-pounding standstill when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin first stepped onto the surface of the moon. The fascination somehow faded during the space shuttle years. Unless there was a tragedy, as happened with Challenger and Columbia -- and with the exception of the shuttle mission on which Glenn, at age 77, became a crew member -- most of the shuttle flights drew little more than a national glance or two. It may have had to do with the fact that in an age when television images were king, the shuttles, for all the dangers they presented to their dedicated crews, on TV appeared more like giant commercial airliners than exotic spacecraft as they returned to make their landings. The very name -- ""shuttle"" -- sounded deceptively routine, although the missions were anything but. Whatever the reason, it seemed more difficult, during the space shuttle era, to get the public especially interested. The International Space Station, for all its jaw-dropping technological capabilities, and for all the bravery of its resident astronauts, has faced an even bigger hurdle in attracting the attention of the constantly distracted people of Earth. Because the space station has been up there so long, people seldom pause to consider the wonder of it all. In recent days, though, it has been in the news. NASA announced this month that the space station will continue circling the Earth for at least four years beyond its previously planned splashdown in 2020. Now, it will be inhabited until at least 2024. And last week the six occupants of the space station finally received their Christmas gifts. The presents from their families, along with crates of supplies, were supposed to be delivered last month, but were delayed. The cooling system breakdown had held things up, and then there was an explosion on the sun that unleashed particles that could have caused problems during the transport. (And you think you had a creative excuse for being late to work.) The gifts and supplies that eventually made it to the station, by the way, were delivered not by NASA but by a for-hire private company. Two such companies, Orbital Sciences Corp. and SpaceX, are contracted to fly supplies to the International Space Station. Even that fact plays into the misguided perception down on Earth that the space station is, if not ho-hum, then not the stuff of tingling drama. There are already plans for privately owned ""space taxis"" to take future astronauts to and from the station, a far cry from the breathless years of Mercury, Gemini and Apollo. When the unmanned courier craft arrived last week, the space station residents belatedly opened their Christmas presents. (Incidentally, included in that cargo delivery was a container of live ants. Eight hundred or so of them. It has something to do with an experiment about weightlessness. Just what you would most like to unwrap when you're in a confined area in space, right? Ants.) One measure of the public's attentiveness toward the astronauts of today can be seen in the audience for the Twitter feed of Mastracchio, one of the two Americans up there. He does, indeed, tweet -- circling the Earth, he sends down messages and descriptions so citizens of the world (those with a computer, smartphone or tablet), can in real time and for free be kept up on what is transpiring aboard that miraculous mission. It is a way of instant and intimate communication from space that wouldn't even have been dreamed of not so long ago. He has 36,300 Twitter followers. For comparison's sake, Justin Bieber has 48.7 million followers for the Twitter account of his daily doings. LeBron James has 11.2 million. Katy Perry has 49.5 million. We can get used to just about anything, or so it seems, but it's instructive that we have gotten so used to even this: humans from different countries living in harmony as they hurtle perilously through the dark void so far from Earth. Walter Cronkite is no longer around to tell a breathlessly waiting world of such exploits in space. But if astronaut Mastracchio wants more people to know about the astounding things he is seeing and experiencing up there, perhaps he can prevail upon Justin Bieber to retweet him. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Most people don't know names of those at the International Space Station .
He says spaceflight used to be awe-inspiring. Now we see it as routine. That's regrettable .
He says six astronauts are from countries around the globe, work together on research .
Greene: They Tweet amazing stuff. Why is their following a small fraction, of, say Katy Perry's ."
"(CNN) -- The plane is only in the shot for a few seconds. But in that time, it goes from just another small aircraft landing at a Colorado airport to a horrific fireball. New video from the Aspen/Pitkin County Airport may provide clues about what went wrong on January 5 when the crash killed a co-pilot. Two other people on board the small plane were injured. The black-and-white video shows the plane exploding in flames the instant it touches the ground. As the scorched aircraft continues down the runway, it leaves a long trail of fire shooting into the sky. The airport released images from five infrared cameras in response to an open records request filed by Aspen Journalism, which provided the video to CNN. Witnesses said the plane flipped over, and photos showed the plane upside down on the tarmac, its fuselage charred. The pilot of the twin-engine jet had reported high winds during a previous attempt to land, according to a recording of the air traffic control radio transmission obtained by CNN through FlightAware.com, a flight-tracking website. ""Missed approach, N115WF.Â  33 knots of tail wind,"" the pilot is heard saying a few minutes before the crash. FAA spokesman Allen Kenitzer said the Bombardier Challenger 600 was coming from Tucson, Arizona. The plane originated from Toluca, Mexico, roughly 40 miles west of Mexico City, according to Flightaware. The deceased co-pilot was identified as 54-year-old Sergio Carranza Brabata of Mexico. The Pitkin County coroner listed the preliminary cause of death as blunt force trauma. The injured -- the pilot and another co-pilot flying as a passenger -- were hospitalized with ""moderate to severe injuries,"" said Alex Burchetta of the county Sheriff's Office. The National Transportation Safety Board has launched an investigation. Two celebrities who were at the small airport in the Aspen ski resort area posted Twitter messages saying they witnessed the crash. ""So sad! Horrible plane crash we just saw happen at the Aspen airport,"" singer LeAnn Rimes tweeted. Comedian Kevin Nealon tweeted: ""Horrible plane crash here at Aspen airport. Exploded into flames as it was landing. I think it was a private jet. Fire truck and ambulances were on the scene within minutes."" The Aspen airport is known as a challenging place for pilots to land because of the mountains that surround the runway. The airport tarmac is often filled with private planes owned or chartered by the wealthy and famous who own vacation homes in the mountain resort community. ""Airport is closed now,"" Nealon tweeted after the crash. ""I think I'll drive back to LA after seeing that."" Small plane makes forced landing on Bronx highway .

"(CNN) -- Gil Scott-Heron, dubbed the ""godfather of rap"" for his mix of poetry and music, died Friday in New York, his publicist at XL Recordings said. He was 62. It was not immediately known what killed Scott-Heron, who was best known for the 1970 song ""The Revolution Will Not Be Televised,"" a politically and socially charged song that examined the African American condition in America at the time. The song was banned by some radio stations. Scott-Heron died at 4 p.m. at a New York hospital, said Lisa Gottheil, his publicist at XL Recordings. Scott-Heron defined the genre, long-time friend and former bandmate Charlie Saunders told CNN. Saunders worked on Scott-Heron's 1970 debut album ""Small Talk At 125th & Lenox."" Saunders, a percussionist, said the last time he saw Scott-Heron was about two years ago when he needed a place to stay. ""He came by our house to get himself together. He spent 4 to 5 days and then moved on,"" Saunders said. Much of Scott-Heron's poetry and music reflected his struggles with drugs and alcohol. Born in 1949, Scott-Heron first gained fame for his poetry and spoken word performances in the late 1960s. By the mid-1970s, he had published two books of poetry and recorded four albums, including ""Small Talk At 125th & Lenox."" His early albums, ""Pieces of a Man"" and ""Winter in America,"" have been credited with influencing other musical genres, such as hip hop. But it was the song ""The Revolution Will Not Be Televised"" that put Scott-Heron on the musical map. His music has been sampled by everyone from Kanye West, who sampled ""Comment #1"" for his 2010 song ""Who Will Save America,"" to Common's sample of ""No Knock"" on his 2008 hit ""Universal Mind Control."" After a 13-year hiatus from making music, Scott-Heron put out a new album last year called ""I'm New Here."" In a 2008 interview with New York magazine, Scott-Heron revealed he had contracted HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, after years of battling drug and alcohol addictions. In 2001 and 2007, he was jailed on drug charges. CNN's Denise Quan and Greg Morrison contributed to this report.","NEW: Gil Scott-Heron is best known for the 1970 song ""The Revolution Will Not Be Televised""

"(CNN) -- Dutch speed skating star Sven Kramer was left in tears after confused communication with his coach cost him a gold medal at the Winter Olympics on Tuesday night. The 23-year-old was hot favorite to add the 10,000-meter title to his 5,000m victory earlier in the Vancouver Games, and he completed the grueling circuit in what would have been an Olympic record time. However, his dreams of a double gold crumbled when he was disqualified for an incorrect change of lanes, meaning that the man he was paired with -- Russia's Ivan Skobrev -- won the silver medal and South Korea's Lee Seung-Hoon was promoted to first place. Kramer, the world champion and record-holder at both distances, blamed his coach Gerard Kemkers for the mistake, the Vancouver Sun reported. ""Usually, I don't want to blame anyone else, I take responsibility as the skater on the ice. But this time I can't do anything else,'' the son of two-time Olympic speed skater Yep Kramer told reporters after the race. ""I wanted to go on the outer lane, then just before the cone Gerard shouted, 'Inner lane!' I thought he was probably right. At first I thought my skates passed the cone on the wrong side, and I will be disqualified. Then I noticed in the stadium, something was wrong. ""You have to decide in a split second. I should have gone with my own thoughts but I was brought into doubt. This really sucks. This is a real expensive mistake. This really sucks.'' Sports Illustrated: Coach's gaffe costs Kramer gold . Kemkers, a former speed skater who won a bronze medal in the 5,000m at Calgary in 1988, was also devastated by the turn of events, the Vancouver Sun reported. ""My world collapsed. This is a disaster. This is the worst moment in my career. Sven was right, I was wrong,'' he said. Kramer will have the chance to bounce back and try to claim a second gold in the team pursuit event on Saturday -- and erase another embarrassing Olympic memory. At the 2006 Turin Games, Kramer stepped on a block and fell during the team pursuit semifinals and meant the Dutch ended up with only a bronze medal. In such speed skating events, also known as long-track, the athletes race to set the fastest times in staggered starts. In short-track speed skating, the competitors race against each other, with passing the finish line first after a set number of laps taking precedence over elapsed times.","Sven Kramer left in tears after confused communication with his coach cost him a gold medal .

"(CNN) -- I was 5 years old when the person who took my innocence touched me inappropriately. What he did to me went on for a period of time, though I don't remember how long exactly. He was a teenage babysitter. His sister also participated in the abuse. She taught me things that no child should know about sex. To this day I don't understand why they did what they did. I'm not sure I care why they did it. What matters to me now is talking about it. As a victim, I want to start a conversation about sexual abuse. As a society, I'm well aware that many people -- victims like me -- are afraid to speak out because they feel ashamed or scared. But by remaining silent, victims like me feel like we're taking responsibility for a crime committed against us that we know is wrong. I wanted nothing to do with the abuse. I didn't want it to be a part of me, so I ignored it for almost 25 years. During that time, the memories haunted me and I developed unhealthy coping mechanisms to compensate for the negative way I saw myself. I tried to be outwardly perfect. I withdrew and became defensive when I faced criticism. But in order to heal, victims need to be able to talk about what happened to them, to acknowledge the horror of it, to condemn it and to demand punishment. For example, if we pretend that armed robberies don't happen because they are bad, we would probably have Bonnies and Clydes running around everywhere. By talking about sexual abuse, we send a message to society to pay more attention to this problem. It's not easy for me to disclose this part of my life. But with the love of my family and friends, I have begun to address the problem. Part of that includes seeking the help of a therapist to understand the impact of the abuse. And then something happened the other day. When Woody Allen received a lifetime achievement award and got a standing ovation at the Golden Globes on Sunday night, his ex-wife Mia Farrow and her son Ronan Farrow sent out tweets that alluded to alleged sexual abuse of Mia Farrow's adopted daughter Dylan, who was 7 when Allen and Farrow were married. Allen denied the allegation and was never charged, but Mia and Ronan believe otherwise. Their tweets made me think of my own past. I remember reading an article a few months ago about the allegation. When I read about Dylan and the Farrows trying to put forward her voice and her story, I wondered what was holding me back in telling my story. Now, I'm revealing to the public something so personal I'm not sure what's going to happen as a result. I am not sure how people will treat me. I don't know if people will think I am damaged. I hope not. I've been told I am brave for talking about it. But I wish I never had to be brave. I wish it had never happened. It's a punishment to me every day knowing that the people who abused me -- who impacted my life in such a harmful way -- escaped justice. As much as I want to bring my case to justice, it is difficult to do so because it happened more than two decades ago in a foreign country. At the time, I didn't understand what was happening to me. I was 5, and I wasn't going to take anyone to court. I am not entirely sure that going public with my story is a good idea. I do know that the alternative - denial and silence - is no way to live. I felt ashamed of something I didn't do. But as I have begun to talk about the abuse, I have discovered that I have no reason to feel ashamed. There are many adults who may feel ashamed about sexual abuse in their own life. They may be confused about what to do. They may think -- ""what if I am wrong and I accuse this person and create a mess"" -- and they balk at action. They should take action -- when they are ready. Whether that means taking their perpetrator to court, speaking out about how to help victims, discussing with their communities about ways of prevention, or advocating for more resources to help those who are being sexually abused or were sexually abused. The therapy I have been lucky enough to have access to has changed my life. An important part of overcoming sexual abuse is addressing the stigma of seeking the help of a therapist, because some people may think you're crazy or unstable. I am not. But I was wounded. Therapy has helped me begin to heal that wound. According to National Center for Victims of Crime, one in five girls and one in twenty boys are victims of sexual abuse. Such abuse causes children to ""develop low self-esteem, a feeling of worthlessness and an abnormal or distorted view of sex."" And when they grow up, they can become withdrawn and suicidal. As a journalist, every day when I show up for work, I ask other people to tell their stories from staring down the Navy Yard shooter to surviving the Moore, Oklahoma tornado. I ask these people to be fearless in telling the world about their stories. But when it came to my own story, I haven't done it...until now. I believe in telling the truth -- and I believe telling the truth can set you free, however trite that is. If you can find your words, you should use them. I hope it helps.

"(CNN) -- Paris Hilton entered guilty pleas on two misdemeanor counts in a Las Vegas court and was placed on probation for a year Monday morning under a plea deal to settle a cocaine possession charge. Hilton admitted to the judge that cocaine found in a purse she was carrying after a traffic stop last month was hers and that she lied about it. ""I said that the purse wasn't mine to the officer, your honor,"" Hilton said. A felony cocaine possession charge was dropped in exchange for Hilton's guilty pleas on misdemeanor charges of drug possession and obstruction of an officer. The celebrity-socialite will have to stay out of legal trouble for the next year or face time in a Las Vegas jail, Judge Joe Bonaventure told her. Any arrest, other than a minor traffic citation, would trigger a probation violation ruling, he said. ""The Clark County Detention Center is not the Waldorf Astoria,"" Bonaventure said to Hilton. The judge also ordered Hilton to complete an intensive substance abuse program. ""We've arranged for Ms. Hilton to be in an outpatient program,"" defense lawyer David Chesnoff told the judge. Hilton also will have to pay a $2,000 fine and complete 200 hours of community service, the judge said. She will not have to report to a probation officer. ""You have to understand When you break the law here, there are consequences,"" the judge said. Bonaventure said it is not unusual for such felonies to be reduced to misdemeanors for defendants with no criminal record. ""This is a typical negotiation,"" he said. ""I know that Ms. Hilton is contrite and accepts responsibility for her actions,"" Chesnoff said. Hilton was arrested after a traffic stop on the Las Vegas strip on August 27. A motorcycle officer reported smelling the odor of marijuana coming from the Cadillac Escalade driven by her boyfriend, Cy Waits. A small plastic bag of cocaine fell out of a purse she was holding and into the hand of a police lieutenant while Hilton was being questioned, according to the police report. Hilton does have a criminal record, including a Los Angeles drunken driving arrest in 2006. She was arrested three times in the following months for driving on a suspended license. She spent two days in jail in June 2007 before Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca released her, saying she could complete her 45-day sentence at home. The next day, however, a judge ordered her to return to jail, where she remained 18 more days.","Judge to Hilton: ""You break the law here, there are consequences""

"(CNN) -- The 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut was tragic enough, but what has been playing out over the last few weeks has made the story even more stomach-wrenching. More than half the money raised by the 26.4.26 Foundation, a Tennessee-based charity that ostensibly was established to help the shooting victims' families, has turned up missing along with one of the organization's co-founders. As I write this column, law enforcement officials here in my state and elsewhere are trying to figure out why about $70,000 of the more than $100,000 raised by the group never made it to those families. Unfortunately, this type of story has become far too common among charitable organizations. There are unscrupulous people in the world who try to exploit tragedies in order to enrich themselves. These people take advantage of the wonderful human trait of compassion for others. They undermine the most noble of selfless acts made on behalf of our brothers and sisters in need. So while our generous response to tragic events such as floods, fires, earthquakes or horrific crimes is admirable, it needs to be tempered with a sense of caution. When we spend our hard-earned money to buy goods or services, it is reasonable to compare prices and research product quality. We do this because we want to make wise purchasing decisions. It is imperative that we apply the same logic to our charitable contributions. In Tennessee, with a few exceptions, charitable organizations are required to register with the Secretary of State's Division of Charitable Solicitations and Gaming and file annual financial reports. Many other states have similar reporting requirements. Would-be donors who take the time to review these reports can learn a lot about charities that are soliciting funds -- such as how much of their funds are used for administrative costs and other expenses and how much are used to actually provide services to the needy. Of course, not all charities follow the law. The 26.4.26 Foundation didn't register in Tennessee. If a charity hasn't registered in a state where it's required to do so, then that should raise a red flag for potential donors. In addition to the information charities must provide to state governments, there are nonprofit organizations such as the Better Business Bureau, Charity Navigator, Charity Watch and GuideStar that can be useful resources. Also, it helps to follow some basic rules before making a donation to a charity. Reputable charities shouldn't object if you want to do some research and send them a donation later. Ask questions such as: . -- How will the money you donate be used? -- How long has the charity been in operation? Where are its offices? -- What types of programs and services would your donation help fund? -- How much of the donation would be spent on the organization's administrative expenses and other costs? -- Would a portion of the donation be kept by the solicitor as a fee? If you get vague or unsatisfactory answers to those types of questions, you need to carefully consider whether your money might be better spent elsewhere. Also, don't ever make cash contributions. It's much easier for cash to be misspent and it's more difficult for donors to claim cash contributions as deductions on their tax forms. When paying by check, make the check payable to the organization, not an individual. And only pay with a credit card if the organization is well established and highly trusted. Otherwise, you may be opening yourself up to the potential of identity theft. When tragedy strikes, we should help victims as quickly as possible. However, by taking the time to do a little research before giving to a charity, donors could prevent their money from falling into the wrong hands. And that, in turn, would help ensure that the truly needy get the aid and comfort they deserve. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tre Hargett.","Money from a charity to help victims of Sandy Hook shooting has gone missing .

"Paris (CNN) -- France's two presidential contenders continued to battle over the country's undecided voters Thursday, after sparring over the economy in their one head-to-head debate ahead of Sunday's runoff vote. In a combative televised debate Wednesday night, President Nicolas Sarkozy and challenger Francois Hollande focused on the economy, social issues and immigration. But despite the trading of personal insults, neither landed a killer blow, leaving both candidates keen to seize the advantage in the last two days of campaigning. Centrist candidate Francois Bayrou announced Thursday that he would vote for Hollande, but urged his supporters to vote with their conscience. Both candidates hope to pick up a share of the 9% of votes that went to Bayrou in the first round. Sarkozy, of the center-right UMP party, was to hold a rally in the southeastern city of Toulon Thursday, while Hollande, of the center-left Socialist party, addressed supporters in the southwestern city of Toulouse. The economy and immigration have been at the heart of campaigning, with France struggling to overcome with low growth and 10% unemployment. In his opening salvo Wednesday night, Hollande said he would be the president of unity, justice and recovery. ""I want to unite all the French. ... It is in this way that we will recover our confidence,"" he said. Sarkozy's response was to highlight the imminent danger in which he sees the country. ""We are not in a crisis, but among many crises,"" he said. In a direct appeal to the country's undecided voters, he then said: ""Unity is when we talk to the people of France, not just to the left."" He also accused Hollande of favoring union members over the general public interest, and said with his opponent as president there would be ""more taxes and more debt."" Hollande in turn attacked Sarkozy on divisions in the country, saying he has split the population. In one of several testy exchanges, he also accused Sarkozy of cronyism. ""You appointed your close colleagues everywhere, in all the ministries and regional government. If I understand correctly, you appointed them everywhere,"" he said. In response, Sarkozy, who is trailing in opinion polls, questioned his rival's grasp on the truth. ""Can I finish my sentence? What you are saying now is a lie. It is slander. You are nothing but a little slanderer,"" he said. Accusations of dishonesty again came to the fore in another exchange. ""What is extraordinary about your answers is that whatever happens in France, you are happy, although the French are clearly not,"" Hollande said. ""What you are saying is a lie,"" Sarkozy responded. ""When you say I don't care about my responsibilities, that is a lie."" Hollande, who in campaigning has sought to paint Sarkozy as more interested in looking after a wealthy elite than the common people, stressed his own commitment to social justice. ""I will be the president who believes in justice, because we are living through a difficult crisis, which is hitting those who work the hardest, who have less money,"" Hollande said. ""I want justice to be the foundation of all the decisions that we make."" On immigration, Sarkozy repeated his position that France has too many immigrants to be able to provide the necessary jobs and housing. ""France is an open country; I know myself where I am from. But we have welcomed in too many people, we have to reduce the number of those that we allow in, not because we do not love them,"" he said. He said France has always had very generous social benefits but immigration should be halved. Hollande agreed that economic immigration should limited, but was quick to say that Sarkozy is responsible for higher rates of immigration to France over the past 10 years, as interior minister for five years before becoming president. The two rivals have been competing to reach out to the 6.5 million voters who supported the third-place candidate in the first round of voting, the right-wing National Front leader Marine Le Pen. In the April 22 balloting, Hollande received 28.6% of the vote, slightly ahead of Sarkozy's 27.2%. Le Pen, who has called for sharply curbing immigration, received 18% of the vote. Speaking to CNN affiliate BFM-TV Thursday morning, Marine Le Pen said: ""I got the impression that (Hollande) played his role as expected -- but of course you know perfectly well my fundamental opinions on socialism, and my total disagreement with it."" She added, ""Nicolas Sarkozy was not clear in his strategy. We see that he has a strategy that is quite varied ... from day to day. We don't know any more what his position is."" Le Pen said Tuesday she would not back either candidate and would leave her voting slip blank on Sunday. She told supporters to vote ""with your soul and your conscience."" Socialist party leader Martine Aubry praised Hollande's performance in the debate. ""He had the stature, he stayed on course, he knew where he was going, he held true to his values,"" she told French network TF1. ""He put morality in the center of everything ... justice at the heart of France, and bringing together all of the French people."" Jean-Francois Cope, of the UMP party, was equally appreciative of Sarkozy's performance. The debate exposed the rivals' very different characters, he told TF1, allowing voters to see ""on one side, Nicolas Sarkozy, because of his maturity, his experience, of the competence of someone who for five years has carried on his shoulders and guided our country through a period of crisis, and Francois Hollande on the other side, hesitant, and naturally -- same as anyone who has difficulty with the subject -- arrogant."" Wednesday's debate was the only head-to-head encounter for the two rivals. Paris voter Dominique Templier, 57, said she had already decided whom to back -- and the debate didn't change her mind. ""They both stood their ground and I didn't hear anything new, and I don't have the feeling that it did much for those who are still making their minds up about Sunday's vote,"" she said. Olivier Poulizac, 26, said he found the discussion of the economy unenlightening because it lacked depth. ""I had the impression that both of them were lying, so it's difficult to decide,"" he said. ""I don't think there was a real winner in the debate and I don't think it's changed much for those who are still undecided."" Far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon, who received about 11% in the first round, will hold a rally in Paris Friday. He has already urged his supporters to back Hollande. Under French election rules, campaigning will end at midnight Friday. Voters go to the polls Sunday. If elected, Hollande would be France's first left-wing president since Francois Mitterrand left office in 1995. Sarkozy has been president since 2007. CNN's Saskya Vandoorne, Anna Prichard, Rachel Ramsay, Basil Yousuf and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","NEW: Francois Bayrou says he's backing Hollande, tells supporters to vote with their conscience .

"(CNN) -- CNN marked a milestone Monday. Just before noon, the @cnnbrk account topped 10 million followers on Twitter. That puts our Twitter account in the company of Lady Gaga, President Barack Obama and Cristiano Ronaldo. To mark the occasion, it's worth reflecting how we got here. The first tweet on @cnnbrk wasn't news, and it wasn't written by an employee of CNN. ""Testing"" is what James Cox tweeted in January 2007. Cox said he started the account as a way to receive CNN's breaking news alerts on his phone. The account started to grow and gain attention. Journalist and fellow developer Brian Boyer posted this to his blog back in 2008: ""@cnnbrk ain't CNN but with >30K followers, he owns the brand."" Cox wrote a response to that post: ""I've been in contact with CNN -- they won't sue, i'm fairly sure, however i'm constantly dealing with the problem of confusion -- users still think that @cnnbrk is an official feed, therefore making me a defacto CNN employee, which is a problem."" We didn't sue, but we did work out a deal to get the handle. As we celebrate reaching the 10-million-follower mark, Cox is the first person we should thank. The second person to thank, naturally, is Ashton Kutcher. In 2009, he challenged CNN to a competition to see who could first reach 1 million followers. Kutcher won. At more than 13 million followers, @aplusk is still in the lead. And we're still coming after him. We have a simple approach to @cnnbrk, and we believe that's one of the keys to its success. Breaking news, from an organization that built its brand on breaking news. Straight up. Some of our most retweeted items include colorful observations from events such as last year's conventions, slightly offbeat news and old-fashioned big breaking news. This isn't to say we aren't still ""testing."" We haven't always been first. It's rare that we get it wrong, but when we do, we've tried to be transparent about it. We believe that's another key to our success. And we have a dash of fun on occasion. The CNN homepage team has managed @cnnbrk for the past three years, hand-crafting every tweet, 24-7, mostly from our home base in Atlanta. They deserve the bulk of the cake and Champagne for this latest accomplishment. That team is headed by Carl Lavin (@FromCarl), our lead homepage editor. Lila King (@lilacina), our senior director for social news, is a spirit guide over all of CNN's social media efforts. ""B-R-K,"" in newsroom shorthand, isn't the only Twitter account at CNN.

On @cnn, you'll find breaking news -- and lots more. Some of our biggest and brightest names and shows have active, highly followed accounts. Many of our sections and beats, such as @cnnopinion, have their own accounts. The news team at Twitter called @cnnbrk the ""Lady Gaga"" of news. Some of the staff is now suggesting that we wear meat dresses to work. Instead, we'll thank those who got us started, tweet a thank you to all 10 million of our followers, and press on to 11, 12, 13 million and beyond.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistani Army carried out airstrikes late Wednesday that targeted militant hideouts in the country's volatile northwest, killing 15 people, the military said. ""Foreign fighters"" were among those killed in the strikes in North Waziristan Agency, according to a statement Thursday from the military. North Waziristan is a Pakistani Taliban stronghold in Pakistan's loosely governed tribal areas bordering Afghanistan. The area is dangerous and hard for journalists to reach, making it difficult to independently verify the military's account. Mir Ali, where the strikes took place, is one of the biggest towns in North Waziristan. Attempts to reach people living in the area were not immediately successful Thursday. The strikes destroyed a large cache of arms and ammunition, the military said. The Pakistani government said this week that it had suspended peace talks with the Pakistani Taliban. The talks lasted for about 13 days, but the militant group carried out several deadly attacks during that time, the government said. CNN's Sophia Saifi reported from Islamabad; Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong .","The strikes target an area near the Afghan border known as a Pakistani Taliban stronghold .

"(Real Simple) -- Visit a bathroom in a home in the Netherlands and you might find a good idea staring you in the face: a list of birthdays important to your host posted opposite the toilet. Why in that spot? To assure that it's viewed regularly. While you may not want to sacrifice your bathroom aesthetics for the sake of remembering key birthdays, the more often you see the dates, the more likely it is you'll remember them. As founder and ""Exalted Queen Mother"" of the Red Hat Society, an international network of women over 50, Sue Ellen Cooper chooses to keep her long list of reminders in the kitchen. ""I have a list of every significant birthday taped to the inside of my pantry door,"" she says. ""It's impossible not to see those dates every time I open the pantry."" Whether it's inside a cabinet, on the refrigerator, or bookmarking a page in the novel you're reading, place your list in a spot where you are likely to view it every day and you'll always be aware of an impending birthday. Real Simple: How to handle a milestone birthday . Use a perpetual calendar to remember birthdays . Traditional calendars are less than ideal for keeping track of birthdays, as they require you to pencil in all your important dates each year. A perpetual calendar solves that problem by charting the months without naming the day of the week for each date. Find 5-by-14-inch calendars for $10 at www.galison.com. You can also download a printable perpetual birthday-reminder calendar (for free) at Hallmark.com, or use the Real Simple: Birthday reminder worksheet. Similar to a perpetual calendar but used exclusively for birthdays, a birthday book allows you to jot down birthdays without having to rewrite each date yearly. Keep it somewhere visible, though, such as on top of a coffee table or on your desk, as opposed to placing it on a bookshelf, where it may get lost amid your Steinbecks and Angelous. The 2 3/4-by-4 1/4-inch pocket birthday organizer from Fred Flare ($8) will fit in your handbag, so you can commit dates to memory as you wait for your latte. Track birthdays in your day planner . For some, a day planner or a Filofax is preferable to a wall calendar because it's portable. Erica Ecker, a.k.a. ""The Specialist,"" is a New York City-based organizational specialist who recommends writing birthdays in a day planner with a colored marker. ""Pick a unique color,"" she says, ""so that when you go to rewrite the dates for the next year, the birthdays stand out."" Ecker also inserts mini Post-it notes as ""birthday alarms."" Insert one in the planner a few days ahead of the first birthday for which you would like to send a card. This way, you'll get the card in the mail on time. Once you've done that, move the Post-it ahead in the book to a few days before the next important birthday. If rewriting birthdays feels like too much of a chore, jot down birthdays on the tabbed section dividers before each month in your day planner. Then you can simply pull out the dividers the following year and place them before each month in your new planner. Real Simple: Look great in your birthday photos .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The round, red objects that Tokyo's runners have been encountering lately are not the exhausted faces of fellow joggers, but rather a healthy snack at the end of their run. The agricultural giant Kagome told CNN it has placed a tomato vending machine in a station providing lockers and shower facilities for joggers near a popular running route close to the city's Imperial Palace. The bright red vending machine, which has the slogan ""tomato loading"" in Japanese emblazoned on it, serves two sizes of the fruit, costing either 300 yen ($3) or 400 yen ($4) per piece. Kagome is pushing tomatoes as a healthy, rehydrating and nutrient-replenishing option for runners and will keep the vending machine in place until after the Tokyo Marathon on February 23. Japan is the spiritual home of vending machines, with jido-hanbaiki, as they are known in Japanese, dispensing everything from soft drinks to toothbrushes, and even emergency underwear. There are currently around 5.5 million vending machines in Japan, or one for every 23 people in the country, according to the Japan National Tourism Organization. While vending machines dispensing apples and bananas are not unheard of, tomatoes are a new concept. They are replaced every other day, according to reports, to ensure freshness and the Nagoya-based company, which has a large share of Japan's tomato market, says that they can help combat fatigue. ""I recommend runners have one after jogging to supply nutrition,"" a Kagome executive was quoted as saying in the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. Kagome has previously distributed tomatoes to marathon participants, handing out thousands of them at last year's Tokyo event.","A vending machine near Tokyo's Imperial Palace dispenses tomatoes .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Five U.S. contractors detained inside Baghdad's Green Zone now face the Iraqi judicial system, which critics say is rife with problems. The case of five Americans detained in Iraq is likely to be handled by the Central Criminal Court of Iraq. The five were taken into custody early Wednesday in connection with the killing of another American contractor, James Kitterman, according to an Iraqi official involved in the investigation and another source with knowledge of the case. As of Monday, none of the five had been charged. However, under the Iraqi system of justice, they would not be charged until after an investigative judge examines the evidence and decides whether to refer the case to court for trial. The men appeared before an investigative judge Sunday and Monday and will appear again Tuesday, Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh told CNN. They were told to expect a decision Tuesday on whether they would be freed or stand trial, a source close to the suspects told CNN. Under Iraqi law, an investigative judge is assigned to a case when a person is detained. The judge questions the accused, takes statements, and examines and assesses evidence to build a case. The judge also can ask for additional investigators. The law says that detainees must meet with the judge within 24 hours of being detained. However, the current strain on the criminal justice system -- a large number of detainees and a shortage of judges -- means that in reality, the meeting rarely takes place within a day. A murder charge carries a potential death penalty in Iraq, and suspects can be detained indefinitely, according to the law -- ""as long as necessary for the investigation to proceed until the examining magistrate or criminal court issues a decision on the case on completion of the preliminary or judicial investigation or the trial."" Many Iraqi detainees are held for long periods without charges. Once the investigation is complete, the case can be dismissed if the judge decides the evidence against a suspect is insufficient. If the judge deems the evidence strong enough, the judge refers the case to the trial chamber of the court. The chamber can accept the case or send it back for further investigation. If the chamber accepts the case, a three-judge panel is assembled for trial and charges the suspect. In the Iraqi legal system, as in several other countries, jury trials do not exist. But as in most systems, the accused have a right to defense attorneys and attorneys are appointed for them if necessary. Cases like these would be handled by the Central Criminal Court of Iraq. The court has recently come under fire from Human Rights Watch, which in a report issued in December said the court ""is seriously failing to meet international standards of due process and fair trials."" Defendants are detained for long periods before trial with no judicial review, according to the human rights organization, and ""are not able to pursue a meaningful defense or challenge evidence against them. Abuse in detention, typically with the aim of extracting confessions, appears common."" In addition, defendants sometimes have substandard counsel, and the court frequently relies ""on the testimony of secret informants and confessions likely to have been extracted under duress."" In addition, the United Nations last month urged Iraq to impose a moratorium on the death penalty, saying its justice system could not guarantee fair trials. Iraqi Interior Ministry spokesman Abdul Karim Khalaf, however, told CNN that if the evidence against the men warrants it, they will receive a fair trial and will have the right to defend themselves with ""as many lawyers as they like,"" either Iraqis or Americans. Those convicted of murder are executed by hanging. Death sentences, as well as sentences of life in prison, are automatically appealed. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","Five detained American contractors appear in Iraqi court Monday, official says .

"(The Frisky) -- Men don't have ""guilty pleasures."" We own, nay, celebrate what's bad for us. Our obsessions are points of pride, not shame. Some men feel no shame in gobbling three slices of pizza at once if they want to. You'll never see a guy wolf down a small mountain of waffles with a side of bacon and squeal, ""Oh my gosh, I can't believe I ate everything! I'm so ashamed."" We will shamelessly sit in a nest of pizza crusts playing video games for endless hours. Unabashed tears will crawl out of the corners of eyes when the hometown team chokes at the last minute. Beer will be quaffed, their caloric potency mocked. These are the things that make life worth living. Feeling bad about feeling good, even if the good is short-term, is for puritan chumps. If I could, I'd go out everywhere in my sweat pants. Of course, overindulging has its prices. Sloth and gluttony are venial sins for a reason. But the whole idea of ""guilty pleasures"" is something that is lady-specific. Women feel shame over even tiny little hedonistic infractions. I dated a woman once who was very much my type -- hot nerd -- who was deeply embarrassed over her celebrity trash magazine addiction. She actually tried to hide her US Weekly's from prying, judgmental eyes. Eventually, I staged an intervention that went a little like this: ""Please, woman, own your love of snickering over pictures of Hollywood stretch marks!"" This is not to say men aren't susceptible to social pressures, and masculine stereotypes. There are things that, while not ""guilty pleasures,"" are ... minor vices. Things we are into that contradict standard male operating procedure. After all, one cannot live on bacon and beer alone. But a lot of guys find themselves infatuated with hobbies, media, and creature comforts that don't really fit the lumberjack mold. I'll wager many ladies are the quiet guardians of their man's not-really-secret, but not-really-public, quirks. I am not ashamed of anything. This is why I will admit to the following minor vices, and in the process, teach women that they can be loud and proud when it comes to the hours spent rehearsing pucker faces in front of the mirror. Boldly rock your ""guilty pleasures."" Bubble baths . Anyone got a problem with that? I love bath salts, bubbles, fizzy stuff that promises to magically transform your bathtub into a sauna. The whole kit and caboodle. There is nothing I love more than a good, frou-frou soak. Heck, maybe I'll light a votive candle too. Quiche . I ate it this past weekend, in fact. That's right. I shoveled French egg pie into my mouth. Yes, quiche, a food that sounds like an inappropriate bodily sound. It was delicious. It had spinach in it, and I washed it down with sparkling water. Sure, I could have eaten something drenched in cheese, or deep-fried. But the moment called for something sensible, delicate, and... flaky, okay? Quiche is awesome. Reality TV shows about shallow women . A recent minor vice has actually entered my life. Every Tuesday, I eat Chinese food and watch ""The Real Housewives of New York."" Have you seen this show? It's like an open invitation to hate on women. Is this really popular female wish fulfillment? All that chattering, and glittering? They are a bunch of bedazzled banshees that suddenly make me understand why the French guillotined all the rich aristocrats! Sigh. While I'm not overly susceptible to gender norms, I think I need to go to the comic book store, or hit the shooting range. Oh, forget it. See you next week, my beloved ""Real Housewives.""

"(CNN) -- Carly Holbrook came to Aspen, Colorado, for the Winter X Games but left with the love of her life. The public relations exec recalls meeting her future husband after a free concert, a few cocktails and some impromptu salsa dancing. ""As he walked me back to my friend's house later that night,"" Holbrook beams, ""I will never forget the fluffy snowflakes falling from the sky, and street lamps illuminating the charming Main Street. Aspen will always be one of my magical spots."" She's not the only one who swoons over this A-list mountain town. Travel + Leisure's fans and followers ranked Aspen among the best spots for romance in our inaugural America's Favorite Towns survey; readers nominated favorites on social media via the hashtag #TLTowns and then ranked the resulting 744 picks in 55 categories. To calculate the most romantic towns across America, Travel + Leisure looked at the most lover-friendly categories: brunch spots, bakeries, farmers' markets, wine scenes and idyllic, picnic-friendly parks, as well as gay friendliness and, of course, romantic hotels. And in a bid to weed out noisy kids, we gave points to the least family-friendly of the lot. So whether you're aiming to stoke the fires of a long-smoldering interest or spend some quality time bonding with your boo, read on to discover the best towns for romance. No. 1 St. Simons, Georgia . America's top town for romance strikes the right balance between seclusion and accessibility. Located on one of Georgia's Golden Isles, this southern-style beach town has both white sands and live oaks, and was a hit with readers in romance-friendly categories such as picnicking and charming cafés. You can rent bicycles, browse antique shops, and check out another undeniable marker of romantic destinations: the local lighthouse. Stay at the 34-room St. Simon's Inn, and you'll get a clear view of the 19th-century landmark. No. 2 Beaufort, North Carolina . As one of the oldest towns in North Carolina -- it dates back to 1709 -- this Inner Banks village has a boardwalk, stately old homes that have turned into B&Bs (such as the Ann Street Inn, built in 1832) and an A-list pirate past (Blackbeard hung out here). Readers gave it high marks for civility, though: its hotels and inns ranked in the top 10 for romance, and the no-longer-rogueish locals impressed readers for being quite good-looking. Travel + Leisure: America's best new romantic restaurants . No. 3 Amelia Island, Florida . You can't get more picture-perfect romantic than a horseback ride on the beach, and Amelia Island State Park is one of the few spots in the country where you can still saddle up on the sand. Readers loved this barrier-island town most for its parks and its quaint historic inns—such as the Fairbanks House, a Victorian-era home filled with fireplaces, four-poster beds, and claw-foot tubs. Amelia Island also ranked in the top 10 for being welcoming to gay travelers. No. 4 Sag Harbor, New York . Readers ranked Sag Harbor high for romantic hotels, such as the American Hotel, which dates back to 1846. This branch of the Hamptons has long inspired good name-dropping: it attracts plenty of celebs and, more than a hundred years ago, even merited a mention in ""Moby Dick."" On Saturdays from May through October, you can scan the crowds for familiar faces and pick up a local wine and other picnic provisions at the Sag Harbor Farmers' Market in front of the Breakwater Yacht Club. No. 5 San Luis Obispo, California . With mild year-round weather, fewer crowds, and affordable prices (at least compared to L.A. and San Francisco), this central-coast college town embodies California mellow, making for easy romance. It also offers easy access to great wine country (think Sideways), laid-back Pismo Beach, and the grandeur of Hearst Castle. Readers ranked it at the top of the survey for its coffee—like the fair-trade, organic brews served at local favorite Blackhorse Espresso and Bakery. Travel + Leisure: America's favorite towns . No. 6 Aspen, Colorado . The A-list ski town has no shortage of plush hotels primed for romance -- such as The Little Nell or the St. Regis -- or sips to get you there: the Rocky Mountain state's legendary craft beer scene helped rank this tony mountain town at the top of the survey for its local brews (such as Aspen Brewing's pale ale called This Season's Blonde). For a romantic dinner you can't beat Cloud Nine Alpine Bistro, with big views -- from 10,700 feet -- of the Maroon Bells and European-style classics such as fondue and veal schnitzel. Readers also applauded Aspen for its variety of events, from the X Games to the high-minded Aspen Ideas Festival. No. 7 Burlington, Vermont . Rudyard Kipling supposedly once said that Lake Champlain -- the centerpiece of America's best college town -- was the sweetest place in the world to watch a sunset. Readers, meanwhile, loved Burlington for other romantically oriented times of day, such as cocktail hour (it ranked in the top 10 for cool bars), brunch, and the all-important dessert. One sip of Lake Champlain Chocolates' decadent hot cocoas is all it takes to see why the town also scored highly for cafés and ranks among the top 10 for winter wonderland holiday-season visits. No. 8 Sonoma, California . The surrounding wine country makes this bucolic town a no-brainer for romance -- with the added couples-friendly enticements of dreamy hotels (such as the rambling Spanish Mission-style Fairmont Sonoma Mission Inn & Spa) and a noted lack of kids. The foodie factor runs high, too, thanks to renowned restaurants (such as French-country The Girl & the Fig) and top-notch farmers' markets, like the Sonoma Valley Certified Farmers' Market on Fridays. Readers also voted Sonoma into the top 10 for having quirky locals, a plus on any memorable weekend getaway. Travel + Leisure: America's greatest main streets . No. 9 Portsmouth, New Hampshire . Even if winters get chilly here, readers didn't care, giving it high marks for snuggle-ready weather. A great indoor date spot: The Music Hall, a refurbished 1878 theater that presents classic movies and live, unplugged music. Good wine was a major indicator of romance in the readers' survey, but this historic waterfront town woos lovers who love craft beer. The town was once the biggest beer producer in America and is now home to charming breweries such as Portsmouth Brewery and Smuttynose. No. 10 Traverse City, Michigan . This town on the northeastern side of Lake Michigan may be sweet but not cloyingly so: after all, it boasts of being the tart cherry capital of the world. Readers found the most romance in outdoorsy endeavors, such as hiking at the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore or embarking on a fall color drive. For an extra shot of romance, stay at Chateau Chantal. This small, European-style inn offers its own wines, big breakfasts, and water views and was founded by a former priest and nun who later fell in love. See all of America's most romantic towns .

"(CNN) -- Here's where things went wrong: On Tuesday, January 28, 2014, at 1:30 in the afternoon, in response to the sparkle of several snowflakes in the air above Atlanta, virtually the entire adult population of America's ninth most populous metro area stood up, left their workplaces, got into their cars, and created a traffic deadlock of legendary proportions. Good news for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie that he was nowhere near here at the time, nor could he be linked via administrative assistants to our wintry surprise. But among Great Traffic Jams of the 21st Century, move over Fort Lee, New Jersey. My friend Johanna Norry, a Georgia State University grad student, tried to leave her parking place on a downtown parking deck and traveled -- in one hour and seven minutes -- 23 feet. My friend Elida Baverman posted on Facebook: ""Six hours and 18 minutes to get home from Perimeter Mall. Wish my car made it, too."" My husband's law partner, Ed Garland, inched along I-75 north toward home from 5 p.m. Tuesday until 1 a.m. Wednesday, at which point his car ran out of gas. He abandoned it and set off on foot through the snowdrifts, reaching his home at 2 in the morning. What other cities can learn from Atlanta's ice debacle . By all accounts -- I wasn't going out there -- the city's throughways on Wednesday looked like parking lots, where cars with empty gas tanks sat frozen in the Arctic air. (It was 16 degrees Fahrenheit Wednesday morning.) Some of the cars had been abandoned; others might have still had people in them. ""If you are stranded and cannot get through to 911,"" announced the Atlanta Police Department, ""please send the Atlanta Police Department a message through Facebook or Twitter."" One can only imagine: #GetMeTheHellOutofAtlanta. A special Facebook page, ""SnowedOutAtlanta,"" was created to connect the cold, stranded, and demoralized with the warm, housebound, and generous. People in vast traffic jams, with taillights twinkling in endless lines toward every horizon, not only sat in cars steadily running out of gas, they called for help and comfort on cell phones running out of juice. Thus most people seeking help online did so for third parties: ""My boyfriend has been stuck in traffic for nine hours now,"" wrote a woman named Laura. ""He has a heart condition and told me he's starting to feel lightheaded."" Some posted longingly: ""My husband left work yesterday at 4 p.m,"" a woman wrote in at 9 a.m. Wednesday morning. ""Of all days he left his phone at home. ... He had no means of getting in touch with me. If anyone has seen or heard from him, please reply."" Scores of people wrote to offer beds and meals to freezing, stranded travelers. Many offered to drive to pickup points to meet the strangers. Home Depot announced all stores would remain open all night, offering warmth and shelter. Photos surfaced of people in their business clothes asleep on the floor in the aisles of CVS drugstores. A bakery owner offered to donate goods to any place stranded people were gathering. ""Warm home, food, and phone to anyone who needs it!"" posted a woman in Monroe, Georgia. Was Atlanta asleep at the wheel? ""My sister has been stuck in her car since 4:30 p.m. yesterday,"" posted a woman named Valencia on Wednesday, 17 hours after her sister got on the road. ""Nothing to eat. She's nearly out of gas. She is diabetic. Does not have her meds. Can someone please help? She's at Memorial Drive by Alonzo Crim School. Please somebody?"" ""Lawd I'm praying!"" was the first response, from a woman named Kye, after which a woman named Keirsten posted: ""I can walk to her! Call me. Trying to find insulin!"" Then: ""Sending people that way now. What kind of car and where?"" ""Champagne-brown Infinity. She made it to the gas station across from AutoZone."" ""My friend Jessica is walking that way right now."" ""Thank you! You found her!"" posted Valencia; then, a bit later: ""She made it home! Praise God!! ... Good people still left in this world!"" The landscapes and language of apocalypse -- many headlines compared Atlanta to a scene in ""The Walking Dead"" -- bore no relation to the footage, the yardage, the square ... inchage of snow actually dumped on the city. How much snow fell? What quantity of snow do you think it takes to paralyze a metropolitan area of 5,490,000 citizens? What kind of whiteout does it take to halt every artery and interstate of this national traffic hub, this city that is home to a highway intersection known as ""Spaghetti Junction"" and to a college (Georgia Perimeter) and a former Atlanta Braves player (""Perimeter"" Perez) both named after Interstate 285? How much snow did it take to strand thousands of children overnight in their schools, send trucks and buses spinning out of control on surface streets and highways, decree that a baby should be born in a car trapped by traffic gridlock, and inspire Gov. Nathan Deal to declare a statewide State of Emergency and to call out the National Guard? It was 2.6 inches, OK? Or, as some news sources reported, ""up to 3 inches,"" a bit of forgivable inflation that would seem to suggest it might have been quantities up to and including 2.9 inches. Nearly 3! But it doesn't take depth of snow to ice the streets, and it doesn't take a blizzard to panic the citizenry in a city without snowplows, snow shovels, windshield ice scrapers, or even, seemingly, a product known as ""salt."" Just a sprinkling of snow will do, a delicate frosting, a few curlicues from Jack Frost -- and here we are, immobilized, freezing, turning in desperation to strangers and Home Depot. Opinion: Stranded in Atlanta . I wasn't on the road Tuesday. And I woke up to 46-degree weather, not 16. But the 46-degree weather was in my bedroom because our furnace died during the night. Two weeks ago, when a deep freeze rolled across Atlanta, our pipes burst. We seem to be living in close synchrony with every national weather event. So while tens of thousands of our fellow citizens rumbled nowhere, I screened ""How to Fix Your Own Furnace"" videos on Youtube. Inspired, I descended into the freezing basement and spent 15 minutes trying to remove the front of the furnace. Then my husband unscrewed a protruding screw and it fell off. I peered deep into the machinery of the still and very cold machine and confirmed by phone that no repair person south of the Mason-Dixon Line could travel the treacherous roads to our house. My husband, children, two dogs, two cats, and I huddled around electric space heaters all day. As I type, my feet are wrapped in a blanket and a space heater is warming a 4-inch stretch on the side of my right leg. My teenage daughter has spent the day wrapped in an electric blanket on the sofa, with the dachshund wrapped inside it, too. But it could be worse. I could be on I-285. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Melissa Fay Greene.","Melissa Greene: Fort Lee, New Jersey, traffic jam was nothing compared with Atlanta's .

"(CNN) -- Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono sought to present a united front on the controversial issue of asylum seekers Monday, as the two leaders held talks in Jakarta. The talks -- Abbott's first on foreign soil after assuming the premiership last month -- took place in the wake of the deaths of at least 36 people on Saturday off the coast of West Java, Indonesia. ""We are determined to end this scourge, which is not just an affront to our two countries, but which has so often become a humanitarian disaster in the seas between our two countries,"" said Abbott during a joint press conference with his host. OPINION: Why Australia's asylum plan won't work . ""They give us a burden socially and economically,"" agreed Yudhoyono. ""When they want to make their way to Australia, they also burden Indonesia. So in this spirit, to enable Indonesia and Australia to solve their problem, we have to work together."" On Monday, 28 survivors were being cared for by immigration officials in the West Java city of Cianjur, according to local police spokesman Martinus Sitompol, who added that rescue and recovery efforts would continue for the next three days. Most of the boat's occupants were from Lebanon and Iraq, officials said, while others came from Nigeria, Jordan and Iran. It's believed they were heading for the Australian territory of Christmas Island. Last week, Abbott moved to defuse tensions with Indonesia over how Australia handles asylum seekers entering its waters, dismissing the situation as ""a passing irritant."" ""The last thing I would ever want to do is anything that doesn't show the fullest possible respect for Indonesia's sovereignty,"" Abbott told Fairfax Radio. ""This is a broad and deep relationship which is going to get broader and deeper over time. ""The last thing anyone should want is to have Australia's relationship with Indonesia defined by this boats issue, which I am sure will be but a passing irritant."" OPINION: Australian parties in 'race to bottom' on asylum seeker policy . Abbott has ordered a military-led border protection plan in response to an increased number of illegal arrivals by boat -- many of whom use Indonesia as a staging post in onward voyages into Australian waters -- and has told the Royal Australian Navy to turn back vessels when it is safe to do so. Australia's new Liberal-Coalition government argues that the tow-back policy would show criminal syndicates in Indonesia that it was serious about smashing people-smuggling operations. Indonesia, however, has been cool towards the tow-back scheme which it sees as a violation of its sovereignty. At a meeting in New York with Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop last week, Indonesia's Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa warned that Indonesia would not accept violations of its borders, cautioning the Abbott government against taking any ""unilateral steps"" that would put the ""cooperation and trust"" between the two countries. Ignoring a plea from Bishop to deal with the problem ""behind the scenes,"" Indonesia took the step of publishing details of the private conversation, a move seen by commentators as a blunt warning from Indonesia. ''Asian diplomacy in particular is marked by understatement ... this is what makes it such an extraordinary development,'' Acting opposition leader Chris Bowen told ABC TV. ''It's an unprecedented step by an Indonesian foreign minister, I can't recall an Indonesian foreign minister taking a step like this in relation to Australia ever before.'' The Indonesian Foreign Ministry and the Ambassador to Australia both issued statements last week saying the meeting transcript was not intended to be issued. Former Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer weighed into the debate on Friday, saying Indonesia needed to accept responsibility for the problem. ''They do have to understand that it's their boats with their crews, their flagged boats, which are breaking our sovereignty and are breaking our law by transgressing our national borders, our maritime borders,'' Downer told Fairfax Radio. ''There's no point in allowing ourselves to be bullied by the Indonesians in this way. I mean, we have to stand up for ourselves and stand up for our national interest and be prepared to call it as it is."" Indonesian researcher with Human Rights Watch Andreas Harsono told CNN that refugees were caught between harsher policies emanating from Australia and harsh conditions in Indonesia, which is not a signatory to international conventions on refugees. ""The problem in Indonesia is that there is a lack of a protection mechanism within the Indonesia legal system to protect these asylum seekers,"" Harsono said, adding that refugees -- including unaccompanied minors -- were often placed in detention for a year and had no right to work or go to school on their release. He described Australia's tow-back policy, meanwhile, as ""dangerous."" ""Most of these boats are not seaworthy, many of them do not have GPS or other navigational equipment -- to tow them back into international waters is dangerous,"" he said. ""What Tony Abbott can do is to urge Indonesia to ratify the refugee conventions."" According to the latest data from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship there were 17,698 asylum seekers as of March, 2013. The figures show a marked increase in the number of people seeking asylum in Australia, with the first three-quarters of 2012-13 already ahead of the total for the entire 2011-2012 period. The figures also show that for the first time ""irregular maritime arrivals"" (IMA), or boat people, for the first time outnumber arrivals by air (non-IMA). Despite the recent increases in the number of asylum seekers, Australia takes just 3% of the world's refugees, according to figures from the United Nations High Commission of Refugees. The majority of asylum seekers arriving in Australia by boat were from Afghanistan in 2011-12, with Iran, Sri Lanka and Pakistan the next largest groups.","Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott meets Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in Jakarta .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United's record signing Juan Mata made a winning start to his Old Trafford career on a night when Arsenal's Premier League ambitions encountered a setback. The Spaniard played 85 minutes of United's 2-0 victory over Cardiff City before being substituted to a standing ovation following a promising debut. ""It was a very special day for me. My first game -- my debut -- with a victory. It was perfect. I enjoyed it a lot,"" Mata told Manchester United's in-house media company MUTV. ""What I love most is to play. So these minutes [on the pitch] are very important. Now I'm going to train and I'm looking forward to playing at the weekend and trying to do my best for the team."" Signed for a club record $61 million, Mata -- who trained with his new team-mates for the first time on Monday following his move from Chelsea -- had a hand in United's opening goal. It came as he swept a diagonal ball out to Ashley Young, whose cross was eventually turned in by Robin van Persie after Antonio Valencia's header hit the crossbar. The Dutchman had needed just six minutes to score after making his first start since December 10 following a thigh problem. Young doubled the lead in the second half as United ensured that the return of 1999 Champions League winning legend Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, now in charge of Cardiff, to Old Trafford was not a happy one. United's victory enabled them to close the gap on sixth-placed Everton, who were thumped 4-0 by city rivals Liverpool as Daniel Sturridge (2), Luis Suarez and Steven Gerrard gave the home fans a night to remember. The misery for Blues boss Roberto Martinez was compounded when Romelu Lukaku was forced off the field on a stretcher after a worrying injury to his ankle. Dropped Points . Another manager who may be feeling a little unease is Arsene Wenger, whose Arsenal side lost two potentially crucial points at Southampton in a 2-2 draw. The Gunners' coach was held up in traffic ahead of the game and the team also struggled to go through the gears, trailing 1-0 at halftime following a lackluster 45 minutes. Goals from Olivier Giroud and Santi Cazorla turned the game on its head, but Adam Lallana replied for the hosts to ensure that the match finished 2-2. Arsenal still lead the Premier League but the draw means second-placed Manchester City can climb above them should Manuel Pellegrini's free-scoring side win at Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday. Chelsea can also climb above Arsenal on Wednesday, should Jose Mourinho's side beat West Ham at home by more than two goals. In Tuesday's other games, Swansea and Crystal Palace recorded much-needed wins -- at home to Fulham (2-0) and Hull (1-0) respectively -- while Norwich hosted Newcastle in a goalless encounter that featured a red card apiece for both sides.","Record signing Juan Mata makes Man Utd debut and departs to standing ovation .

"Washington (CNN) -- A congressional investigation into the Defense Department's response to the deadly attacks in Benghazi, Libya, found that the Obama administration failed to protect the compound and recognize the severity of the deteriorating security situation. For the partisan report, the investigative arm of the Republican-led House Armed Services Committee pored over thousands of pages of classified and unclassified written material, witness testimony and classified briefings to piece together the events of September 11, 2012, that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. ""This report should be considered one component of continuing comprehensive Benghazi related oversight underway in the U.S. House of Representatives,"" the report says. Since the attack a year and a half ago, conservatives have been skeptical about the Obama administration's account of the events and say they suspect a cover-up. Just after the attack on the U.S. compound, Obama administration officials said the violence was a result of a protest over a controversial film about Islam made by an American -- a claim that has proved to be untrue. While this investigation focused on the role of the Defense Department, it blames the Obama administration and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's State Department for failing to protect the compound that housed U.S. personnel. The report found: . • White House officials failed to comprehend or ignored the dramatically deteriorating security situation in Libya and the growing threat to U.S. interests in the region. • U.S. personnel in Benghazi were woefully vulnerable in September 2012 because there was no intelligence of a specific ""imminent"" threat in Libya, and the State Department, which has primary responsibility for diplomatic security, favored a reduction of Department of Defense security personnel in Libya before the attack. • Defense Department officials believed nearly from the outset of violence in Benghazi that it was a terrorist attack rather than a protest gone awry. • The U.S. military's response to the Benghazi attack was severely degraded because of the location and readiness posture of U.S. forces, and because of a lack of clarity about how the terrorist action was unfolding. • Given the uncertainty about the prospective length and scope of the attack, military commanders did not take all possible steps to prepare for a more extended operation. • There was no ""stand down"" order issued to U.S. military personnel in Tripoli who sought to join the fight in Benghazi. However, there was confusion about the roles and responsibilities of the personnel. • The Department of Defense is working to correct many weaknesses revealed by the Benghazi attack, but the global security situation is still deteriorating and military resources continue to decline.

"New York (CNN) -- New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who took office 44 days ago promising to bring together residents of a divided city, was widely vilified Thursday for keeping the nation's largest school system open during a brutal storm expected to leave up to 14 inches of snow in some areas. While millions of children in the region were given the day off, New York City public schools -- with 1.1 million students -- remained open, triggering an avalanche of anger from many students, parents and even one well-known weather anchor. ""It's always a tough decision based on imperfect information,"" de Blasio told reporters late Thursday morning. The mayor said the National Weather Service reported as little as 3 inches of snow on the ground at the start of the school day, with warmer conditions than in previous storms. Since 1978, he said, New York City schools have closed due to snow just 11 times. ""At the time,"" he said, ""we thought our children would be able to get to school safely."" On Thursday, attendance in city's public schools was 44.65%. Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency Thursday for New York City, Long Island and the Mid-Hudson areas. ""These regions are expected to continue to receive heavy snow that may accumulate at rates of around two to three inches per hour, which will make it difficult for plows to keep some roads clear. New Yorkers should stay off of the roads and remain in their homes until the worst of the storm has passed,"" the governor said in a statement. On January 3, with only three days in office, de Blasio closed schools when snow combined with frigid temperatures in the first ""polar vortex"" of the year. But his administration was criticized for not canceling school on other days, including the January 22 storm that brought about a foot of snow to New York. ""There are huge number of parents for whom the consistency of the school schedule is absolutely necessary,"" de Blasio said. ""They are going to work, they have no choice. If they can't get their kid to school, they don't have another option. There are huge numbers of parents for whom their kid getting to school also means their child will have a good meal, and in some cases, two meals. And so, the fact is, it's a very big deal to some parents."" 5 reasons schools hate snow days . Schools Chancellor Carmen Farina, noting that the snow had mostly stopped in the late morning, said: ""It is absolutely a beautiful day."" Many others disagreed with the decision. ""I understand the desire to keep schools open. The only thing that trumps that is safety,"" Michael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers, the city's teachers union, said in a statement. ""Having students, parents and staff traveling in these conditions was unwarranted. It was a mistake to open schools today."" The New York City Department of Education's Facebook page exploded with angry comments. ""It was a mistake to open schools and mayor de Blasio and Carmen Farina should be ashamed of themselves for allowing it,"" wrote Steve Caruso. ""It does not show concern for safety it shows stupidity!!!!"" Snookie Cameron wrote: ""Maybe Farina should keep the schools open late for the kids to get dinner. It seems that school isn't for an education anymore but only to get food. It is not meals on wheels!!"" Even NBC ""Today"" show weather anchor Al Roker laid into the mayor on Twitter from Sochi, Russia: ""Mr. Mayor, I could never run NYC, but I know when it's time to keep kids home from school."" When asked at the news conference about Roker's comments, De Blasio said: ""It's a different thing to run a city than to give the weather on TV,"" he said amid laughter. ""How about all the parents and caregivers who have to scramble to get their kids home? Is there no one there with common sense?"" Roker said in another Tweet. ""It's going to take some kid or kids getting hurt before this goofball policy gets changed."" By midday, nearly 10 inches of snow had fallen in Manhattan's Central Park, according to the National Weather Service. ""Are conditions perfect? No, they're not,"" de Blasio said, adding that basic services were functioning. In 2013, more than 21 million children nationwide had free or reduced-price lunches, or roughly 70% of the total students who ate school lunches, according to the USDA's Food and Nutrition Service. More than 23 million households received SNAP benefits, known as food stamps, that same year. ""So many families depend on their schools as a place for their kids to be during the day, a safe place where they are not only taught, they get nutrition, and they are safe from the elements,"" de Blasio said. School closures announced with 'Ice Ice Baby' CNN's Steve Kastenbaum contributed to this report.","NYC decision to open public schools during blizzard draws wrath of parents .

"(CNN) -- New ships, expanded technology and pop culture phenomena are some of the factors making 2014 an alluring year for a vacation at sea. January through March is known as ""wave season"" -- when cruise lines roll out perks and promotions to entice travelers. But don't fret if you're not ready to plunk down your credit card. Experts are predicting more year-round savings at sea. The traditional wave season booking window can be a great time to snag a deal such as 2-for-1 fares, on-board credits and suite upgrades, according to online cruise guide Cruise Critic, but it doesn't always reflect rock-bottom pricing. Cruise Critic Editor-in-Chief Carolyn Spencer Brown says that she's expecting this year to bring ""especially competitive pricing"" in the Caribbean, because of an influx of ships plying those waters. And if Alaska is on your cruising bucket list, she says now is a great time to book and take advantage of discounts for travel in April or May. Blood Falls and other natural oddities . ""The first tip for saving money is not to primarily focus on saving money,"" Spencer Brown says. Good value comes from not only getting the right price but also in finding the right trip for your vacation needs and preferences. To that end, Christine Duffy, president of Cruise Lines International Association, says online research is fine, but ultimately working with a trained agent will get you the best prices because cruises are ""much more complicated than booking a flight from point A to point B."" Agents familiar with all the options can help with cabin selection, shore excursions and even packaging airfare to get the lowest price. Follow your preferred cruise line on social media to keep up with flash sales and seasonal specials. Once you're on board, amazing add-ons can boost your experience, but they usually come with a hefty price tag. Check to see if your cruise line offers any advance-purchase deals for dining, alcohol or spa treatments. And ""keep an eye out for specials advertised in the daily program,"" Spencer Brown advises, as those can be big money savers. 12 months, 12 amazing adventures . Stick to a set budget for a la carte purchases for a vacation free of financial surprise and use the on-screen feature on your cabin TV to track your daily spending. ""Be sure to resolve any concerns before the final day,"" Spencer Brown says. Cruising in 2014 is a far cry from the lazy stereotypes of bygone years; today's cruiser can plan on zip lining and skydiving between meals shared with ""The Cat in the Hat"" or a favorite musician. Pop culture has invaded the oceans. Here are five things cruise lines are doing to lure new and repeat cruisers: . Creating exotic and intimate experiences . Cruise ships are getting a warm welcome in Asia, where Cruise Lines International Association says 3.7 million passengers per year are expected by 2017. From the wilderness of the Russian Far East to ports in Myanmar and Malaysia, there's an emphasis on taking passengers to places far off the beaten path. Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand and Japan are also beckoning cruise ships. What's more, exotic destinations can also equal top cruising value, according to Spencer Brown. ""Destinations like Japan, Norway and Australia offer exceptional value for money, as exploring them by land tends to be extremely expensive, but traveling by cruise ship costs much less and is often more convenient,"" she says. The Cruise Critic editor also flags the Panama Canal as a hot spot; it turns 100 this year, with a new visitors' center ready to welcome cruise passengers. The rivers of the world are also commanding more attention, with tailored itineraries and smaller, luxury vessels attracting globetrotters. River cruising is the fastest-growing segment of the cruise industry, says Duffy, with eight of the 17 new ships due out in 2014 destined for river journeys. Offering shorter -- and longer -- voyages . To attract first-timers wary of an entire week at sea, cruise lines are offering more weekend-length cruises. At the same time, lines have realized that sometimes, the typical shore excursion doesn't allow enough time to revel in all that a port has to offer, so itineraries have changed. For example, Norwegian and Royal Caribbean spend more than a day in Bermuda, Carnival ships stop overnight in Nassau, Bahamas, and a Seabourn sails with a three-day stopover in St. Petersburg, Russia. Improving connectivity . Connectivity is at an all-time high on the high seas, with bow-to-stern Wi-Fi and less expensive communication services than in years past. Cruise lines have spent millions revamping their wireless infrastructures, increasing bandwidth for faster connection speeds and even offering perks such as 500 minutes of free Wi-Fi that's given to concierge-level cruisers aboard Regent Seven Seas Cruises. These are especially appealing to the social media-loving millennial crowd, who can't wait to share their vacation experiences via Twitter and Instagram. Harnessing the power of pop culture . The ""wow"" factor of cruising is still strong, with ships constantly trying to outdo each other, not only with bigger and better berths but also with unique activities and elite celebrity associations. This year marks the debut of ""Seuss at Sea,"" a family program on Carnival Cruise Lines, featuring Dr. Seuss-themed fun including ""Green Eggs and Ham"" breakfasts, costume parades and character events. Adults will have no problem finding their pop culture fix afloat, thanks to programs such as ""Dancing With the Stars at Sea"" competitions on Holland America, which will lead to a complimentary seven-day ""champions cruise"" for 15 finalists and their guests in December. For the less competitive, every Holland America cruise offers free dance classes based on routines from the hit TV show. Rolling out new ships . Every year brings new vessels designed to convince landlubbers of the advantages of a journey at sea. While this year brings fewer ""mega ships"" than in the past, innovation remains in the forefront on ships of all sizes. Here is a handful of this year's newcomers: . • Quantum of the Seas: This Royal Caribbean ship gets the ""wow factor"" award, with a skydiving simulator, bumper cars, an aerial viewing pod and inside cabins with ""virtual balconies"" thanks to giant LCD screens showing an ocean view. • Norwegian Getaway: The Broadway musical ""Legally Blonde"" will be on board as well as the line's signature special-effects magic show. Miami pop artist David ""Lebo"" Le Batard was commissioned for the ship's impressive hull art, which features a whimsical mermaid. • Costa Diadema: Diadema is Italian for tiara, and this ship will be the largest and most modern built for Costa Cruises. Set to launch in late 2014, it will hold more than 3,700 passengers and feature public areas that resemble a beachfront resort. • Avalon Waterways' Illumination: This is one of three Avalon Suite Ships coming out in 2014; each features two decks of panorama suites with wall-to-wall windows, complimentary Wi-Fi and alfresco dining options. • Viking Cruises Longships: Fourteen of these will launch from Avignon, France. Each will hold fewer than 200 passengers and offer five cabin sizes, including massive 445-square-foot Explorer Suites with balconies off the bedrooms and living rooms. • Regal Princess: An adults-only pool, a glass-enclosed ""SeaWalk"" extending 128 feet over the water and balconies for all outside cabins are among the highlights on this 3,560-passenger vessel. • Pearl Mist: All 108 staterooms have private balconies on this new luxury ship being built for Pearl Seas Cruises. What's more, a dozen of the cabins were built for solo travelers. 11 places to go in 2014 .","Expert expects ""especially competitive"" cruise prices in the Caribbean this year .

"(CNN) -- At 19 years old she was spotted by a talent agent while engaging in a shouting match with a bank teller in Los Angeles. Since then Charlize Theron has powerfully demonstrated an almost chameleon-like ability to assume the roles she takes on. Whether it's as a lesbian serial killer in ""Monster"" or a no-nonsense mission director searching for clues to the origins of mankind in sci-fi hit ""Prometheus,"" Theron has repeatedly proven why she is one of Hollywood's highest-paid women. Read more: Must-see African movies . But the Academy Award-winning actor has another starring role -- helping prevent the spread of HIV and AIDS in her homeland of South Africa. Despite recent success in combating the disease, around 5.6 million South Africans have HIV. ""We are in a very, very dangerous period right now, because of our successes,"" says Theron. ""South Africa has had a 63 % drop in new infections when it comes to children under the age of 14. It's a huge success to celebrate and we dropped tremendously when it comes to mother-to-child transmission. ""I think a huge misconception is that 60% is ok, and the problem with not having it be 100% and no more new infections, is that the disease will come back rolling again."" Theron recently traveled to the province of Kwazulu Natal as an advocate for The Global Fund, a financing institution that aims to ""prevent, treat and care for people with HIV and AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria."" In KwaZulu Natal one in four 15- to 24-year-olds has HIV, according to UNAIDS. Theron believes the key to making a difference lies in empowering African youth at a grassroots level. ""It's festering now in a pivotal group of young girls, between the ages of 15 and 24,"" she says. ""These girls are very, very hard to reach, and if we do not grab that bull by the horns right now ... we're going to see this disease come back and just cause double the devastation that it has.""

As part of her work with the Global Fund, the actor attends educational workshops to discuss HIV and the use of antiretrovirals -- the medication used to suppress the disease. ""It's devastating that we can sit today and look at the devastation that this disease is still causing, especially in my country -- in South Africa -- when it's completely preventable,"" she says. Born and raised in Benoni, a small town on the outskirts of eastern Johannesburg, Theron relocated to Italy aged 16, then New York a year later, to pursue a modeling career. Much of her time is now spent in the United States but Theron, 38, still identifies herself as an African woman, which she says is where the desire to help comes from.

I think that kind of investment must come from a deeper place."" The actor -- who is also a U.N. Messenger of Peace -- has consistently used her high profile to push her activism pursuits over the years. In 2007, she launched the Charlize Theron Africa Outreach Project -- a not-for-profit that has provided mobile health assistance to secondary schools in impoverished areas of South Africa. ""Africans are very proud people in general and have been able to survive on being self-sufficient and innovative and resilient with everything that we had to deal with,"" she says.

"(CNN) -- Chelsea ended Manchester City's 100% home record in the English Premier League with a 1-0 win at the Etihad Stadium on Monday evening. Home fans had enjoyed a feast of 42 goals in 11 previous home league fixtures this term, but it was Jose Mourinho's side who walked away with the spoils on this occasion. The goal which ultimately settled the match came in the 32nd minute after a threatening Chelsea attack looked to have broken down. Ramires had a shot blocked by Vincent Kompany after Eden Hazard had cut the ball back from the right, but the ball rolled out invitingly to Ivanovic who thundered a low left-foot drive past a helpless Hart. It was a lead that Chelsea deserved after limiting City to few chances in the first half while operating nimbly on the break. The visitors were unlucky not to double their lead a minute before halftime as the excellent Hazard this time found space on the left. His cross flashed across the six-yard box before falling at the feet of Samuel Eto'o, but the Cameroon striker could only direct his shot onto the bar. The Blues were at it again in the second half when Nemanja Matic's rasping drive clattered the crossbar in the 53rd minute as Chelsea took control against an increasingly wasteful City side whose best chances came from long range. Silva forced Petr Cech into a fine save from a 73rd-minute free kick and substitute Stevan Jovetic (on for Alvaro Negredo) also went close in injury time, but Chelsea held firm to record a vital win in the title race. ""I think we played fantastic,"" Mourinho told Sky Sports afterwards. ""Against a fantastic team to play the way we did I think is amazing. ""The best team in the Premier League we beat them twice and especially today we were fantastic. They had a couple of chances to score but we had the better chances to kill the game and the players played with fantastic spirit,"" he added. ""While they had the ball we were all very humble and very ready to work defensively and when we had the ball we were trying to play and we played really well."" Chelsea return to the Etihad in just under two weeks to face City in the fifth round of the FA Cup, where they will look to inflict a third defeat on Pellegrini's side this season following tonight's win and their 2-1 league win at Stamford Bridge in October last year. Defeat for City not only ends a run of 11 home league wins but an unbeaten run of 20 matches. It was also the first time they had failed to score at home since a 0-0 draw against Birmingham City way back in November 2010 -- a sequence stretching back 61 games. Tonight's result sees Arsenal, who beat Crystal Palace 2-0 on Sunday, stay on top with 55 points from 24 matches. Chelsea stay in third, but are now level on 53 points with second-place City. Two other games were played in Europe on Monday. In Serie A, Sampdoria beat Genoa 1-0 while in La Liga Villarreal's 3-1 win against Osasuna moves them to 40 points and within three of fourth-placed Athletic Bilbao.

"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- In the heart of Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city, the Little Peruvian Corner turns out spicy lomo saltado -- or jumping sirloin -- for a fast-growing immigrant population. Edgar Villar is the proud owner. After nine years in Brazil, often working illegally for next to no pay, he has opened his own restaurant. He sends $150 to $500 a month to his mother in Lima, Peru. ""Brazil has a strong economy, so you can make money if you are careful about what business you get involved in,"" he says. Immaculate red and white tables dot the second-floor walk-up business that's usually full of Peruvian immigrants at lunchtime. Villar arrived in Brazil from Lima on a tourist visa years ago. The money he had to live on quickly ran out. He took jobs sewing textiles and even worked for room and board so he could learn the jewelry-making trade. ""It wasn't slave labor because I knew what I was getting into,"" he said. ""And I really learned a trade."" Villar took advantage of a 2009 amnesty program from the Brazilian government to become a legal resident and worker. He used his savings and legal status to open Little Peruvian Corner. Villar hired Peruvian immigrants as waiters and cooks, but he still dons an apron and fries up the popular dishes. ""I still do a bit of everything,"" he says. ""It depends on the day."" For decades, it was working-class Brazilians who went abroad in search of opportunity, fueling the domestic economy with remittances. But today more immigrants are coming to Brazil, Latin America's economic powerhouse. There are about 2 million foreign residents - both legal and illegal immigrants. Many are blue-collar workers from Bolivia, Peru and Paraguay. Some are from as far away as Angola. They typically work in sweatshops, churning out textiles or stringing together costume jewelry. The Center for Immigrants' Human Rights says Brazil's immigrant population will continue to boom. ""We've got the World Cup in 2014 and then the Olympics,"" says Paulo Illes, a coordinator at the center. ""So there are going to be opportunities in totally new sectors like civil construction."" And that will be positive for other economies as immigrants send money back home. Sao Paulo's Bolivian immigrants tend to congregate on Coimbra Street, a couple of blocks from a bustling wholesale textile market. Women sell Bolivian chairo stew and fresh bread on the street. On Coimbra, bus tickets to Bolivia for the holidays are offered in local shops. While life has become easier for immigrant communities, there are still many struggles. They must learn Portuguese, work in often difficult conditions and, in some cases, avoid police raids. But Chalo Mendoza says things have improved since he started working in Sao Paulo a decade ago. ""When I arrived I was alone. Now it's like the street is paved with Bolivians,"" he says. Mendoza's popular Chalo Barbershop is a gathering spot for Bolivians. Dozens of job and housing notices line the shop's hallway. ""We have rights and obligations,"" he says. ""We have to comply with Brazilian law. But we are also good for Brazil.""","Immigrants contribute to Brazil's economy .

"(CNN) -- Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer on Friday signed into law a bill that requires that requires immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there is reason to suspect that they're in the United States illegally. During the signing ceremony, the governor spoke about concerns over the possibility of racial profiling, announcing that she was issuing an executive order for the development of training for law enforcement on how to implement the law fairly. In remarks earlier in the day, President Obama criticized the Arizona bill, but he also said that failure by the federal government to act on immigration reform would contribute to ""irresponsibility by others,"" a pointed reference to the bill Brewer would sign into law. Here are excerpts from remarks Friday by Obama and Brewer. President Obama . ""Government has a responsibility to enforce the law and secure our borders and set clear rules and priorities for future immigration. And under Secretary Napolitano's leadership at the Department of Homeland Security, that's exactly what we're doing. We've strengthened security at our borders, ports and airports and we will continue to do so, because America's borders must be secure. ""Businesses have a responsibility to obey the law and not undermine American workers, especially when so many Americans are out of work. Many businesses work to comply with the law every day. But for those that don't -- those that ignore the law and exploit and abuse vulnerable workers and try to gain an unfair advantage over all the businesses that do follow the law -- we will hold them accountable. ""And people who are in America illegally have a responsibility -- to pay their back taxes and admit responsibility for breaking the law, pay a penalty, learn English, pass criminal background checks, and get right with the law -- or face removal -- before they can get in line and eventually earn their citizenship."" ... ""Indeed, our failure to act responsibly at the federal level will only open the door to irresponsibility by others. And that includes, for example, the recent efforts in Arizona, which threatened to undermine basic notions of fairness that we cherish as Americans, as well as the trust between police and their communities that is so crucial to keeping us safe. ""In fact, I've instructed members of my administration to closely monitor the situation and examine the civil rights and other implications of this legislation.

And it does so while ensuring that the constitutional rights of all in Arizona remain solid, stable and steadfast."" ... ""This legislation mirrors federal laws regarding immigration enforcement.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A Los Angeles County judge ordered former NFL star and rape defendant Darren Sharper to be held without bail Thursday in the wake of additional charges in Arizona. Sharper, 38, was being held on $1 million bail connected with charges of drugging and raping two women in the Los Angeles area, but Judge Renee Korn removed the bail and ordered him to remain in jail after this week's announcement that an Arizona grand jury has indicted Sharper. Sharper's next court date in Los Angeles is March 24. A grand jury in Tempe, Arizona, indicted Sharper on two counts of sexual assault and three counts of administering dangerous drugs relating to an incident alleged to have happened on November 21, Tempe police said Wednesday. Authorities have said Sharper, 38, is under investigation in three other states -- Louisiana, Nevada and Florida -- in cases of alleged sexual assault. So far, he has been charged only in California and Arizona. New Orleans police have issued an arrest warrant for Sharper. Another man accused in the New Orleans case, Erik Nunez, was charged last week with two counts of aggravated rape and released on $400,000 bail on Monday, CNN affiliate WVUE reported. The application for the arrest warrant says New Orleans detectives interviewed two women who said they were raped on September 23. The two accusers told police they were so impaired they don't recall ""the entirety of the sexual intercourse,"" and that they never agreed to have sex. In February, Sharper pleaded not guilty in the Los Angeles County court to charges of rape by use of drugs, furnishing a controlled substance and possession of a controlled substance, all felonies. Those alleged rapes occurred in January and last October, authorities said. His attorneys said he maintains any sex was consensual. In the Florida investigation, a woman in January filed a sexual battery complaint in Miami Beach against Sharper relating to a 2012 incident, a police report said. Miami Beach Police said they are investigating the case. Sharper played for the Green Bay Packers, Minnesota Vikings and New Orleans Saints from 1997 through the 2010 season. The five-time Pro Bowl player intercepted 63 passes in his career, tying for seventh all-time; he is tied for second all-time in interceptions returned for touchdowns with 11, according to Pro-Football-Reference.com. He was recently fired as an NFL Network analyst.","A judge removes bail and orders Darren Sharper to remain in jail .

"(CNN) -- ""They tried to forget us, as if we never even lived there,"" says Circassian architect Abdullah Makhmudovic Berisov. Now 67 years old, Berisov speaks about the pain he feels when thinking of the 2014 Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia, and how the opening ceremony failed to mention the history of the Circassian people who once called Sochi their capital. Berisov is not alone. Circassian artist Sheomir Guchepshoko, 32, says far from being a source of pride, the Sochi Olympics are a tragic reminder of what was lost during the Russian-Circassian war that ended in 1864. ""It was our land,"" he says, ""but during the opening of the Olympic Games, they said it was a Greek land, and then after that it was Russian land. They didn't say anything about the Circassian part of Russian history. And it really hurt."" And even more egregious than failing to be recognized, say some Circassian activists, is that the Olympic venue at Krasnaya Polyana was built on what they say is the mass burial site of the Circassians' final defeat. In these Olympic Games, ""athletes are skiing on the bones of our ancestors,"" one activist says, adding: ""It would be like Germany deciding to build an Olympic Park on Auschwitz."" Circassian historian Samir Khotko says the international attention on Sochi as the host city of the Olympics has awakened a movement to push the Russian government to officially recognize what he and others say was the Circassian genocide of 1864. The Circassians lived in Sochi for millennia, says Frankie Martin, a research fellow at American University's School of International Service in Washington. In the 19th century, Russia coveted their land -- which is south and east of Russia proper -- and brutally defeated them, decimating entire tribes, he says. Russia killed around 1.5 million Circassians and expelled a similar number. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who personally lobbied for Sochi to host the Winter Olympics, has repeatedly urged observers to avoid mixing politics with sport. But activists say the effort to draw attention to their cause has come at a price. They point to what they say are campaigns of intimidation and detention by Russian security forces in order to silence criticism. Circassian activists say that on February 7, dozens were detained in the city of Nalchik while trying to peacefully protest the start of the Olympic Games. In Maykop, the capital of the Adyghe region, about 150 miles north of Sochi, Guchepshoko's sand art exhibit paints a tale of a 101-year-long war and the tragic exodus that he says is in danger of being forgotten. The Russian conquest of the Caucasus is widely documented in Russian literature and history, yet Circassians say their portion of this history -- a story of crushing defeat, widespread killing, and mass deportation to the Middle East and elsewhere -- is strangely absent from Russian history books. Guchepshoko says that as a child growing up in Russia, he knew very little about his ancestry. Learning Circassian history was prohibited in school, he says. ""When I was a child, it was if I was a guest in my own country. But slowly, I found some information about our history, and now I understand. I am a Circassian."" ""I started to think about it. It's like there was a hole in my heart, and now I want it to be filled."" When asked if he worries about angering the Russian government with his art, he admits there is some risk but adds that it is his duty to show younger generations, like his, what really happened in the Caucasus 150 years ago. ""I want to show the truth,"" he says. ""Because some young people, people who live here, they don't know about their own history."" An attempt to preserve culture . Circassian activists point out that there were efforts to preserve parts of their culture when the area was part of the Soviet Union. To this day, there is an autonomous region not far from Sochi reserved for the Adyghe, a subset of the Circassian people. In Maykop, the Circassian language is spoken on the street and shares a place next to Russian on historic landmarks. Last year, workers constructed a monument to the Circassian people in a scruffy park next to a mosque that was built in the 1990s. But the monument is still unfinished, its designer pointed out. It lacks a dozen bronze stars as well as lights to illuminate it at night. Meanwhile, in the Olympic Park in Sochi, authorities had authorized the establishment of an Adyghe cultural exhibit. But Adam Bogus, leader of a Circassian council in Maykop, says Russian Olympic organizers refused a number of specific requests, including the movement of the remains of those lost in the battle at Krasnaya Polyana to a separate cemetery and the creation of a special museum to house precious artifacts that would be recovered during that resettlement. Bogus says those requests were denied, and instead of preserving the graves, construction crews desecrated many of them during the creation of the Olympic ski venue there. Bogus says they also asked for a portion of the cultural program in the Olympic opening ceremony to acknowledge the Circassian chapter of Russian history. And he was hopeful they would honor that request. ""We believed the Olympic tradition would be observed here ... until the very last minute,"" he says. ""And that too did not happen."" But even with the heartache Bogus says the Circassian people feel now as a result of these Olympic Games, he goes on to say that ""Circassians are no enemies of Russia. Ever since Ivan the Terrible, Circassians have helped with the development of Russia."" ""We consider ourselves citizens of Russia, but we would like adequate respect for our culture,"" he adds. It is a sentiment shared by Guchepshoko. ""I don't hate Russia,"" he says. ""My wife is Russian. It's complicated. I do not want this war to be repeated. I do want us to have our land, but I understand that is impossible. I don't want blood. I don't want wars. And that is why it is so complicated."" ""I want to show people what really happened. It's a big tragedy for us, for our people. We lost land, we lost a thousand million people. That's why we can't forget.""

"(CNN) -- Beneath a hand-stitched Confederate flag, Terry Hancock prepared for battle. On this Saturday afternoon, his work as colonel was nearly finished. He'd trained new soldiers, devised field formations and passed combat instructions to captains leading the seven companies in his battalion. He'd buttoned his thick, wool Union uniform, filled his antique canteen and groomed his dark, wiry beard. Now, Hancock waited to storm Alabama's Janney Furnace. ""Honey, I wish they could see how you normally dress,"" said his wife, Amber. ""We ain't Yankees."" She swished up in a plaid, hoop skirt-inflated dress -- which is an ordeal to maneuver in the portable toilet, she admitted -- and touched his cheek. ""Somebody's gotta play the Yankees,"" he said, grinning. Hancock, 47, has re-enacted enough Civil War battles -- 300, he estimates -- to know sometimes you must portray the squadron your ancestors fought. Yankee re-enactors don't always travel to the Deep South for small battles, and this show featured just more than 100 soldiers. That's pretty small skirmish compared with, say, Gettysburg's 15,000 annual participants. He's donned both uniforms throughout his 12-year re-enacting career. Rather than rallying the 48th Alabama Infantry, his normal crew, he led the 23rd Kentucky, Union soldiers who may (or may not) have surrendered to ""homeguard-type"" Confederates. There's little documentation of what actually happened on that day in 1864, other than Janney Furnace, a Confederate iron  compound, had been ""blown up"" by Federal forces. So, he and two other leaders planned an ""educated guess"" scenario, something ""similar to what might've been."" The Confederates would prevail today; Union troops would conquer during Sunday's re-enactment. He watched his men line up, spines straight, listening to a lieutenant check weapons and bark orders. ""Shoulder -- arms!"" ""Support -- arms!"" There was no small talk, no laughter. Getting into character, the character of a soldier, requires focus, diligence and a fastidious attention to historic detail. Every face, young and old, remained stoic. ""Now remember, call for the medic if something's seriously wrong,"" the lieutenant shouted. ""Right then. Onward march!"" 150 years of re-enacting . Before the Civil War ended, re-enactments began. Soldiers, freshly home from combat, recreated battle scenes to educate townspeople and honor fallen comrades. For Gettysburg's 50th anniversary in 1913, more than 50,000 Confederate and Union veterans returned to Pennsylvania to celebrate America's reunification. The former foes, ages 61 to an alleged 112, re-enacted the gruesome clash to an awe-struck audience. After the Civil War's centennial commemorations in the 1960s, modern portrayals trickled into mainstream pop culture. Now, as the 150th anniversary approaches, thousands of Americans dress up to go back in time. Re-enactment groups, located in nearly every state, never stop recruiting. ""It's an expensive hobby with a cult following, and a great way to learn about history,"" said Professor Robert Harrison, who teaches a Civil War re-enactment course at Linn-Benton Community College in Oregon. ""People are meticulous about accuracy."" ""Hard-core"" soldiers have led 20-mile marches and followed strict ""seasonal Civil War"" diets, he said. They often stay in character for a week. But most re-enactors perform for a day and then discuss jobs, families and whatever's in the paper. It's a tight-knit community. ""Their enthusiasm is very high,"" he said. ""It's contagious. After a spectator sees history unfold before them, they're much more likely to go out, buy a Civil War book and learn more. Above all else, re-enactors are educators."" Hancock considers himself an unorthodox Civil War teacher. ""We're living historians,"" he said. ""We re-enact to educate, to enlighten. It's not a redneck hobby."" He remembers visiting Tennessee's Chickamauga battlefield as a 10-year-old boy, enamored by the monuments and their stories. Now, as a retired teacher, he practices his passion with the Hardee's Guard Battalion -- a Civil War re-enactment fraternity scattered throughout Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee. Fellow re-enactors are his best friends, his family. Re-enactments are an escape from reality, a chance to unplug, unwind and eat barbecue -- a far cry from the bloodshed during America's deadliest war. ""Re-enactments put emphasis on the battlefield itself -- the bravery, the heroism, the gallantry,"" said Dr. Clifford Kuhn, a specialist in Southern history at Georgia State University. ""The larger context of the War, like the Southern economic devastation, the enormous death tolls, is conveniently moved to the side."" That can make commemorating tragic events cheerful, he said. ""These re-enactments gather so much attention because they connect with Southerners' personal identities,"" he said. ""Historic re-enactments become community festivals."" Alabama pride . Ohatchee, a small town 60 miles northeast of Birmingham, buzzed with spectators as the 2 p.m. battle approached. ""Show them Yankees!"" ""The South will rise!"" Children waved Confederate flags. Mothers smoothed blankets onto the grassy hillside. Old-style merchants, known on the re-enactment circuit as ""suttlers,"" pushed baked goods, overalls and antique jewelry on the sidewalk. It was a typical re-enactment weekend. Hancock watched his men ready their guns. He checked his brass pocket watch, considering the 40-minute time limit. Sudden explosions arrested the crowd's attention. Puffs of smoke dotted the field, products of ""blanks"" in place of bullets, firing into the cloudless sky. Cannons thundered back and forth. Soldiers collapsed -- some wincing in fake pain, others stifling giggles. One man turned to his friend and yelled, ""This is as much fun I can have with my clothes on!"" Amber watched from the sidelines. ""Go Terry!"" she shouted intermittently, clapping her hands. But as always, regardless of what side he represented, she cheered for the South. ""Ohh-wee!"" she shouted. ""Get them Yankees!""","Re-enactors prepare to commemorate the Civil War's 150th anniversary .

"(CNN) -- Amid heightened tensions with North Korea, the United States and South Korea on Sunday began joint military exercises. The military exercises, dubbed Invincible Spirit, are scheduled to run through Wednesday in waters off South Korea to demonstrate the alliance's resolve. In addition to the 8,000 personnel involved, military officials say, the exercises will include 20 ships and submarines and about 200 aircraft. The U.S. Defense Department said the drills are in response to the sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan and are intended to send a strong message to Pyongyang to stop ""provocative and warlike acts."" The drills will include anti-sub infiltration exercises, said Cmdr. Jeff Davis of the U.S. 7th Fleet. ""The anti-sub-infiltration exercise works like this: if a sub is coming in to attack a ship, the military finds it and prosecutes it,"" he said. Davis said there was a ""renewed desire"" and urgency to focus on the exercise after the Cheonan sinking. North Korea criticized the exercises, which began at 6:30 a.m. (5:30 p.m. ET). ""The U.S. provocations amount to trespassing on the off-limits fixed by the DPRK and it, therefore, feels no need to remain bounded to the off-limits drawn by the U.S.,"" the state-run Korean Central News Agency quoted a North Korean foreign ministry spokesman as saying. It continued, ""It is the mode of the DPRK's counteraction to react to sword brandishing in kind. The DPRK is prepared for both dialogue and war. It will remain unfazed by military threat and sanctions."" North Korea on Saturday heightened its threats against the military exercises after talks over the sinking of the Cheonan. North Korea ""will legitimately counter with [its] powerful nuclear deterrence the largest-ever nuclear war exercises to be staged by the U.S. and the South Korean puppet forces,"" KCNA reported. Two U.S. military officials told CNN there was no sign of significant troop movement in North Korea. Democratic Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, answered ""no"" when asked if there was a real threat of a North Korean military attack over the U.S.-South Korean exercises. ""I think North Korea is just too interested in their own survival to do anything that could end that regime,"" Levin said in an interview broadcast Sunday on C-SPAN's ""Newsmakers"" program. Meanwhile, Friday, in the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas, officers from the North sat down for talks about the Cheonan incident with their counterparts in the U.S.-led United Nations Command. During the almost two-hour meeting in the international truce town of Panmunjom, the U.N. Command reminded the North Koreans of the Security Council's condemnation this month of the Cheonan attack. The Security Council did not mention North Korea by name but condemned the attack strongly, called for ""full adherence"" to the armistice agreement that halted fighting in the Korean War in 1953 and encouraged ""the settlement of outstanding issues on the Korean peninsula by peaceful means."" An international inquiry found North Korea culpable for the March attack that killed 46 South Korean sailors. But North Korea denies a role in the incident, which elevated tension between the two enemies. North Korea demanded again Friday that it be allowed to conduct its own investigation of the Cheonan's sinking and said the upcoming war games are being conducted under false pretext. ""The U.S. forces side would be seriously mistaken if it calculates it can browbeat [North Korea] through large-scale war exercises,"" KCNA said. ""It should immediately stop the [anti-North Korean] nuclear war racket."" At an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) meeting last week, nation after nation expressed deep regrets and offered condolences to the South Koreans. The United States has accused North Korea of aggressive behavior and imposed new sanctions Wednesday. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reiterated U.S. support for South Korea on Friday. ""Here in Asia, an isolated and belligerent North Korea has embarked on a campaign of provocative, dangerous behavior,"" she said in Hanoi, Vietnam. Later, after a repatriation ceremony for the remains of three soldiers who died in the Vietnam War, Clinton said the door remains open for dialogue if North Korea commits to abandoning its nuclear weapons program. ""We would love for them to have the same opportunities that the people of South Korea have been able to enjoy for the last 60 years,"" Clinton said. ""So, it is distressing when North Korea continues its threats and causes so much anxiety among its neighbors and the larger region.""

"(CNN) -- English Premier League side Swansea City have sacked manager Michael Laudrup. Announcing the news Tuesday on the official website, club chairman Huw Jenkins said in a statement: ""It is a decision we have taken reluctantly. But it's a decision made in the best interests of Swansea City Football Club and our supporters. ""It is the first time in nearly 10 years that the club has parted with a manager in this way, but we had to remove the constant uncertainty surrounding the club and Michael's long-term future with us."" Laudrup guided Swansea to the League Cup glory and ninth in the Premier League table last year and this season has been far from disastrous with the club lying 12th in the table and into the last 32 of the Europa League. But a recent slump in form -- six points from ten league games which includes four losses in their last five matches -- means Swansea are just two points above the relegation zone with 24 points. Jenkins went on to thank the 49-year-old Dane for his work since replacing Brendan Rodgers 18 months ago. Club captain Garry Monk replaces Laudrup ""for the foreseeable future,"" Swansea said. ""I hope all our supporters can fully understand how difficult this period has been for us and I would urge everyone connected to the football club to get behind Garry Monk, the staff and players.'' Laudrup is the seventh manager to be sacked this season in England's top flight and follows the recent departures of Malky Mackay (Cardiff City), Andre Villas-Boas (Tottenham Hotspur), Steve Clarke (West Bromwich Albion) and Martin Jol (Fulham) who were all dismissed in December.","Laudrup the seventh managerial casualty in the English Premier League this season .

"(CNN) -- After millions of firecrackers lit and millions of gallons of baijiu (rice wine) gulped, revelers around China conclude the country's 15-day Lunar New Year celebrations with the colorful Lantern Festival, or Yuanxiao Festival. On the 15th day of the first month of the new lunar year, Chinese celebrate the year's first full moon by eating hearty tangyuan (rice dumplings with sweet or meat fillings) with family and solving riddles written on cards hanging from lanterns. The word ""tangyuan"" sounds similar to the Chinese word for ""reunion"" in both Mandarin and Cantonese, and signifies bonds between family members. But there's a problem with this year's festival. This year the Lantern Festival falls on February 14 -- Valentine's Day -- leading to widespread debate among Chinese netizens: Should you share tangyuan with family or chocolate with a lover? According to ChinaNews.com, a recent survey indicates that 43.7% of respondents are choosing to celebrate Valentine's Day with a mate, while only 25.3% plan to spend Lantern Festival with their parents. Although Lantern Festival is an important family festival, it's also known as one of China's two Valentine's Days (the other is on the seventh day on the seventh month of the lunar year). In ancient times, unmarried girls were allowed to leave home only during Lantern Festival's celebration. Hence, the day has traditionally been a popular one for loverbirds to meet. Owing to the rare ""dual holiday,"" in Hong Kong this year, twice as many couples are getting married on Valentine's Day as they did last year. A total of 493 pairs of couples got married on Valentine's Day this year -- only 187 pairs got hitched on February 14, 2013. The Lantern Festival is celebrated outside of China, in countries including Malaysia and Vietnam.","China's Lantern Festival takes place on the last day of Lunar New Year celebrations .

"(CNN) -- After almost 17 years in prison, this was it: This was The Moment. Gloria Killian's murder conviction had been overturned. Carrying a small bag of her belongings, she walked out of prison as a free woman. Only ex-prisoners can fully know the emotions that overtake someone during such a moment. It's a mix of two feelings: joy -- for surviving their ordeal -- and fear about the challenges they surely will face in the outside world. For Killian's friend Joyce Ride, then in her late 70s, picking up Killian was also very emotional. ""Seeing her walk out was a really great joy,"" Ride told CNN, recalling that day in 2002. ""It was like a load was lifted off my shoulders."" The two women noticed a crowd of inmates and visitors had gathered to watch this magic moment. Suddenly the inmates started waving goodbye. The sendoff was sort of a thank-you note. ""Gloria was very popular,"" Ride said. Killian had used her education as a former law student to perform legal work for some of the inmates. Killian settled into Ride's passenger seat and Ride steered toward the exit. ""We did a lap around the parking lot to wave back at them,"" said Ride. Half an hour later, the two friends enjoyed a meal at an Italian restaurant, where Killian savored her first glass of wine since 1986. For someone sentenced to 32 years to life, it was a sweet victory following a hard-fought journey. ""I'm annoyed by injustice. Profoundly annoyed,"" Ride said. ""This was clearly an injustice."" Six suitcases of silver . It all started in 1981, when Stephen DeSantis -- disguised as a phone repairman -- entered the home of elderly coin collector Ed Davies and his wife, Grace, in suburban Sacramento, California. According to the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, DeSantis tied up the couple and was joined inside the house by his cousin Gary Masse. Ed Davies was shot and killed. His wife was also shot, but survived. The cousins stole six suitcases of silver. After an anonymous phone tip accused Masse and DeSantis, police went on the hunt. ""When officers attempted to find Masse, they encountered his wife, Joanne, who told the officers that a woman named Gloria planned the robbery,"" appeals court documents said. Killian was a former law student in her 30s who'd never been in trouble with the law. Masse's wife told police her husband had met Killian through a mutual friend, according to Killian's book, ""Full Circle."" Police questioned Killian and held her without bail for about four months. She told police she was innocent and had never met Masse, and was released for lack of evidence. Then, without warning a year later, police locked Killian away again without bail. Masse had suddenly told authorities that Killian was the crime's mastermind. For a time, the death penalty loomed over Killian, but in 1983 the California Supreme Court changed the rules regarding the execution of accomplices to murder. That ruling made Killian eligible for bail until her trial began, more than two years later. Although Masse implicated Killian at the trial, his cousin DeSantis had testified at his separate trial that ""Killian was not involved in the crime in any way and that he had never even met or heard of Killian,"" according to court documents. But the jury believed Masse's story and convicted Killian on charges of murder, robbery and conspiracy. She was locked up at the California Institution for Women prison at Chino. 'She probably wasn't a criminal' It wasn't until the early 1990s that Joyce Ride came to the rescue. She was visiting women inmates as a member of Friends Outside, one of many nonprofits across the nation that help inmates and their families cope with incarceration and transitioning to and from prison life. By supporting prisoner visits by friends and family members, Friends Outside says, it reduces stress among prisoners, preventing despair and unhealthy behavior. Ride had already raised two daughters as a California housewife. One had grown up to become a Presbyterian minister. The other, the late Sally Ride, had become NASA's first woman astronaut. A nun who volunteered by visiting women in jail inspired Ride to learn more about why so many women who are victims of domestic abuse end up in prison. After her husband died, Ride began dedicating many of her days to visiting incarcerated women. ""It interested me,"" she said. Ride's younger daughter, the minister, understood. But it confused her astronaut daughter. ""Sally couldn't figure out why I was visiting prisons,"" Ride said. Compared to her work at NASA, she said, ""it was a whole other world."" It was pure coincidence that Joyce Ride met Killian in prison. They hoped to work together to help women inmates who had suffered from domestic violence. ""Gloria had a good sense of humor and we just got along very well,"" Ride remembered. After about a year of visits, ""it dawned on me she probably wasn't a criminal. So I asked her why she was there."" Killian told Ride her story. Ride was convinced Killian was innocent. She felt that she had to do something. Despite Killian's objections, Ride started financing a private investigation and legal battle that eventually would win Killian's freedom. ""I was willing to be stubborn and do what it takes,"" Ride said. ""Of course when I started out I didn't know what it was going to cost."" The decade-long battle cost Ride about $100,000. She sold stocks to raise money for Killian's defense and had to pay taxes on that income, she said. Ride's private investigator, Darryl Carlson, uncovered a damning piece of evidence: . It was a letter that proved the prosecution's star witness, Masse, had struck a deal. In exchange for leniency, Masse testified that Killian was the master planner of the home invasion and murder. Killian's prosecutor had never shared that letter with Killian's lawyers during the original trial. Read the prosecutor's letter . In hopes of overturning the conviction, Killian's lawyers used this and two other letters to appeal to the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Circuit Judge Michael Daly Hawkins wrote that the letters ""exposed Masse's motivation to lie and tended to show that he did lie."" The letters made Masse's testimony worthless and ""without it, there was no case,"" Hawkins wrote. Hawkins noted that one of the other documents discovered by Killian's team was a letter Masse ""wrote to the prosecutor shortly after Killian's trial in which he emphasized that he 'lied (his) ass off on the stand' for the government."" Read the official transcript of Masse's letter . Read the opinion of the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals . Eventually, prosecutors dismissed the charges against Killian. The ordeal was over. But not before Killian had spent nearly two decades behind bars. Housemates . In 2008, State Bar of California prosecutors brought ""prosecutorial misconduct"" disciplinary charges against the prosecutor, Christopher Cleland. The court ruled Cleland was ""culpable of failing to disclose exculpatory evidence (one letter) to the defense..."" As a result, the court determined Cleland should receive an ""admonishment"" â€” which is considered neither discipline nor exoneration. Read the California State Bar Court's decision . Now, a dozen years after her release, Killian and Ride are still supporting each other as the best of friends -- sharing Ride's home in Claremont, California. ""All of Gloria's relatives died while she was in prison,"" Ride said. ""So, when she got out, I offered her a place to stay."" They've recently taken in a third housemate, a woman Killian befriended in prison. In the decade since her release, Killian has raised money to help women prisoners. She has founded an advocacy group, the Action Committee for Women in Prison. She also tells her story on the speaking circuit. At age 90, Ride isn't stopping either. She's still volunteering and visiting inmates. ""Prisoners are persons like the rest of us, and they've made mistakes,"" Ride said. ""I think prisoners need friends on the outside."" For Killian, having that friend made all the difference in the world. Ride says America should do more to support the nation's prison population. What do you think?

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Let's say you were making a film. Which do you think would be harder? A. Coordinating a mass alien invasion B. Invoking tidal waves and tornadoes C. Telling a prehistoric love story. Roland Emmerich and Steven Strait (D'Leh) discuss a scene shot in Namibia when the young hunter discovers farming for the first time. For Roland Emmerich, the answer is C. He says ""10,000 BC"" is without a doubt the most difficult film he's ever made. It wasn't the time-consuming graphics that took the greatest toll, nor the need to re-record a lot of the dialogue. No, the most challenging aspect of this film was, um, the weather. ""You're obsessed with the weather channel,"" Emmerich says, of the duration of filming. ""Ninety percent of this movie was [shot] outdoors."" Producer Michael Wimer: ""It seemed like every time we needed sun, we'd get rain, every time we needed green landscape, we'd get snow. There we just got a series of curve balls, the weather is really fickle."" Emmerich says: ""It's like somebody didn't like 'Day After Tomorrow' and was like: 'We showed him.'"" Filming started in the wintry peaks of New Zealand's South Island, then moved to Cape Town in South Africa, then further north to the desert of Namibia. But it wasn't just the weather that tested the filmmakers' skill, patience and stamina.  see scenes from the film » . Prehistoric beasts . Visual effects supervisor Karen Goulekas started working on project two years before principal filming even started. She broke down the script to see what could be done, and what couldn't, then set about the bringing prehistoric animals back to life. Perhaps her biggest challenge was to create the film's ""terror birds"", flightless predators with huge beaks that hunt like sharks, suddenly piercing through long grass to snatch their prey before disappearing again. The birds were based on a number of images. During filming the terrifying bird was actually a blue head on a stick. ""It's been an experience,"" says Camilla Belle (Evolet), ""I've never worked with blue birds before and all that fun stuff.""  see D'Leh take on the terror birds » . Sets . After seeing off all manner of prehistoric threats, the film's hero D'Leh and his assembled army are awestruck by an immense 'lost' civilization dominated by pyramids that reach up into the sky. Not only did the filmmaker build the pyramids (at Dune 7 in Namibia), they also built miniature replicas of the pyramids, 'God's palace', the slave quarters and the Nile River. The buildings were made in Munich before being transport to Namibia in 15 sea containers. Once assembled, they covered an area of 100 square meters. see the pyramids during a battle scene in the film . Costumes . What to wear when you live in 10,000 BC? Presumably there wasn't much choice in those days, which gave the film's costume designers plenty of scope to use their imagination. They dressed the Yagahl tribe, or mammoth hunters, in antelope fur and hides in place of mammoth. But the weather was so cold during filming that some actors also wore thermals underneath. The final scenes required dressing 800 extras as slaves. Each costume had to be handmade to conceal the stitching. Says costume designer Renee April: ""We had an army in the workshops making beads from clay and glass and sewing them onto the costumes as well as making the fabric and headdresses."" 1000 sandals also had to be made to order. Sound . Most of the dialogue in the film had to be recorded not once, but twice. Peter Gleaves, an Automated Dialogue Replacement Mixer at De Lane Lea Studios in Soho, London explains: ""The original sound sometimes has background noises -- wind machines, sounds of cars and aeroplanes -- that in a production like '10,000 BC' you don't want to hear. So to get rid of them you have to get the actors to redo all their lines, or most of their lines."" Steven Strait was summoned to London to re-record some of his dialogue. When the Revealed cameras dropped in he was working on his grunts. see Steven Strait grunting and panting! ""It's an action sequence,"" Strait explains, ""so there are very few words. It's mostly just running and jumping and grunting and doing all sorts of strange sound effects that are going to look incredibly weird in this room, but hopefully it works in the film."" see the final product of Steven's grunting, the mammoth hunt .","Emmerich developed obsession with the weather during filming of ""10,000 BC""

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Bruised by the embarrassing 2 inches of snow that crippled Atlanta two weeks ago, the city rallied this week to make sure a repeat wasn't in store. Here are five reasons Atlanta is not a laughingstock -- this time: . 1. People actually listened . I'll be damned. The most historic thing about the storm was people's response: Folks heeded the warnings and stayed home. I didn't think this was possible, until this week. 2. Southern pride . If there's anything Southerners love, it's unleashing a can of whupass. Atlantans and Georgians are resilient folks. We saw the viral posts about Snowjam 2014 and heard the punch lines. We were determined to do better this time. So take that, critics. Jon Stewart, is that egg on your face or grits? 3. A most awesome robocall . In my 19 years in Atlanta, never before have I received a call from the mayor's office announcing a state of emergency. But Mayor Kasim Reed did just that Tuesday night, urging hundreds of thousands of Atlantans to remain inside ahead of Wednesday's storm and to stay off the roads. That's what I call a Robocall of Awesomeness. Whether it was to scare us or save political face from two weeks ago, its intended effect resulted in people not venturing outside. This is not to exonerate the mayor and Gov. Nathan Deal for their missteps two weeks ago. They blew it during Snowjam, pointing fingers and appearing to play politics while thousands were stranded on the highways of metro Atlanta. In an interview with CNN, the mayor had seemed clueless at residents' angst over his handling of the storm. ""I don't think people are mad at me,"" he told CNN. But too many times we excoriate leaders -- often rightfully so -- but don't credit them when they learn a lesson. It was clear Mayor Reed and Gov. Deal learned from the mistakes of two weeks ago. For his part, Deal was out front early on, urging residents to use caution and be prepared. The two leaders weren't going to let the region become the butt of late-night jokes and viral Internet posts again. 4. Admit it: Those meteorologists are pretty good . OK, my generation of Southerners grew up in an era when winter storm predictions stunk. Forecasters would predict 4 inches of snow and, as kids, we'd ditch homework, drink hot cocoa and stay up late looking out our windows. Once every few years, we'd awake to an inch of snow. This makes for a skeptical bunch. Fast forward to today: Throw into the mix local news reporters who stand outside while nothing is happening and scream from the TV as dire music plays: SOMETHING REALLY BAD IS HEADED OUR WAY! This lends itself to eyeball rolling. And I imagine this played a major role in Snowjam. From officials on high to gritty workers, we collectively yawned -- until we all ran out the door at work at the same time. These days, armed with new-fangled tracking methods, the meteorologists have been spot on. They predicted the storm of two weeks ago with precision and did so again. Granted, the warnings from the National Weather Service of a catastrophic and historic storm -- repeated by every news outlet -- turned out to be over-the-top. The storm was neither. It packed a powerful punch, for sure, but nothing too alarming. Nothing any non-Southern city wouldn't just take in stride. 5. We didn't 'pull an Atlanta' Yes, Snowjam had actually coined a new term. Salt truck crews in the Midwest last week repeatedly told reporters they were out early to de-ice roads because they ""weren't gonna pull an Atlanta."" And this time, by golly, Atlanta didn't pull an Atlanta either. (Apparently the crews in North Carolina were not notified of this term.) Look. Atlanta has plenty of reasons to be a laughingstock. Congested roads, weird political dynamics and far too few World Series titles (not to mention a lack of NBA titles and Super Bowl victories). But we do have a thriving economy, tons of green space and friendly people in a world-class city. I spent Wednesday embedded with Atlanta firefighters at Station 10, Battalion House 5. The collective effort by citizens and local leaders made for a boring day. There were no heroic rescues. This made for a restless bunch. As one put it: ""When's that biblical, catastrophic storm gonna get here?"" To be clear, this storm was far worse than the one two weeks ago. More than 350,000 Georgians were without power at its peak, and at least two deaths were attributed to the weather. It was serious business in small pockets. But because most folks stayed inside, it had the feel of a dud. ""That's the way we like it,"" said fire Sgt. Jared Keba. If this was a catastrophic storm, I hope I live in Atlanta when the apocalypse hits.","Georgia's governor, Atlanta's mayor learned lessons from 2 weeks ago .
Residents decided to heed warnings .
Storm was worse, but roads were clear ."
"(CNN) -- Sid Caesar, who died Wednesday at 91, didn't saunter, glide, bounce or skip into your living room the way other comedy TV stars did. He came at you like a football lineman, charging, roaring, enveloping your senses and tickling them relentlessly with sounds and expressions you either didn't expect or had never heard before. It's hard to believe that someone who was so mercurial and explosive a physical presence could become so beloved and influential an icon of the ""cool"" medium of television in its early years. And yet, at the peak of his fame in the early and mid-1950s, Caesar's audience was broad enough to encompass both working and thinking classes. Imagine what could happen if a great silent-film comedian had passed a crash course in Borscht-belt patter with flying colors, slinging words as he executed pratfalls. Then again, don't imagine. Watch any vintage black-and-white video excerpt from ""Your Show of Shows"" (1951-1954) or ""Caesar's Hour"" (1954-1957). You'll see Caesar in sketches where his characters speak a faux-foreign dialect that, though it's gibberish in at least two languages, makes hilarious sense throughout. You'll see his big fleshy face in tight close-up forcing tears out of his eyes as the fiscally challenged suburban husband whose wife just charged a mink coat to his account. Watch the contortions he puts himself through as he plays a frantically reluctant featured guest on a spoof of the ""This is Your Life"" TV show. The words and comedy of Sid Caesar . You say you're not old enough to remember that vintage TV show? Doesn't matter. It may help to know something about the wretched excesses of 1950s pre-rock 'n' roll pop music to recognize what's being satirized by ""The Three Haircuts,"" a trio of pompous, pompadoured vocalists played by Caesar and sidekicks Carl Reiner and Howard Morris. But if you don't, it won't keep you from laughing yourself stupid at the routine. By the same token, you don't need to have seen the 1953 Oscar-winning movie ""From Here to Eternity"" to appreciate the beautifully timed expression on Caesar's face at the climax of the parody version when he realizes -- never mind. Just watch it. Great comedy is evergreen, no matter what color it's shot in. Though the razzmatazz culture of post-war America inspired Caesar's all-star teams of writers, it was those same writers -- including Reiner, Mel Brooks, Neil Simon, Woody Allen, Larry Gelbart and Mel Tolkin -- who went on to establish and inspire American comedic standards for the remaining decades of the 20th century and into the next one. ""Your Show of Shows,"" after all, aired live on NBC on Saturday nights just as ""Saturday Night Live"" has for almost 40 years. When you watch a classy contemporary sitcom, whether it's ABC's ""Modern Family"" or HBO's ""Veep,"" the character-driven, sophisticated slapstick has its precedents in many of the domestic sketches and satiric skits of the Caesar shows. Caesar's roughneck persona seemed an unlikely vessel for such versatile, urbane humor. But along with his slam-bang agility, he displayed the instincts and timing of a classically trained musician. Much like the leader of a jazz ensemble, Caesar had a cultivated ear, willing to listen carefully and generously to both his writers and his fellow ensemble members Reiner, Morris, Imogene Coca and Nanette Fabray, who became as invaluable to the success of those classic shows as Caesar himself. He was also moody and temperamental. To the end of his life, he regaled interviewers with the story of how, one night in Chicago, he became so enraged at Mel Brooks that he dangled him from an 18th-story window. Brooks, apparently, didn't resent him for it, and cast Caesar in his 1976 ""Silent Movie,"" which showcased the great man's genius for wordless wit. The years between the last ""Caesar's Hour"" in 1957 and ""Silent Movie"" were erratic and not always happy ones for Caesar. He subdued addictions to alcohol and pills, but never caught another wave like the one he rode in the Eisenhower years. Still, he lived long enough to savor the resounding impact he and his work would have on several generations of comics, most of whom, talented as they were, couldn't explode the way Sid Caesar could. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gene Seymour.","Gene Seymour: Sid Caesar was explosive, hilarious comic, very popular in TV's early days .

"(CNN) -- The Kansas House approved on Wednesday a controversial bill that would permit businesses to refuse services to same-sex couples on the basis of religious beliefs. The legislation, known as House Bill 2453, passed 72-49. It will move next to the state Senate. The bill reads, in part: ""No individual or religious entity shall be required by any governmental entity to do any of the following, if it would be contrary to the sincerely held religious beliefs of the individual or religious entity regarding sex or gender: . ""Provide any services, accommodations, advantages, facilities, goods, or privileges; provide counseling, adoption, foster care and other social services; or provide employment or employment benefits, related to, or related to the celebration of, any marriage, domestic partnership, civil union or similar arrangement."" Equality Kansas, a rights organization, blasted the vote. It said the bill, if passed, would allow employees of government agencies to treat legal marriages as invalid. ""Kansans across the state are rightly appalled that legislators are spending their efforts to pass yet another piece of legislation that seeks to enshrine discrimination against gay and lesbian people into law,"" said Sandra Meade, state chair of Equality Kansas. ""HB 2453 is a blatant attempt to maintain second-class citizen status for taxpaying gay and lesbian Kansans."" Same-sex marriage is banned in more than 30 states, including Kansas. Same-sex marriage is legal in 17 U.S states and the District of Columbia: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. Worldwide, 16 other countries (and parts of Mexico) also have laws allowing same-sex marriage and domestic partnerships. Most of the nations are in Europe and South America.

"(CNN) -- With its vast shopping malls, indoor skiing centers and artificial indoor beaches Dubai can lay claim to the dubious distinction of being one of the most air-conditioned cities in the world. According to the World Bank, the emirate is now one of the largest consumers of energy per capita in the world -- and an estimated two-thirds of that in the summer months is burned on driving air-conditioning. Outside temperatures might reach a searing 50 degrees Celsius, (122 degrees Fahrenheit) but inside its public buildings the temperature can be so low that people wear jackets. At some cinemas customers can even rent blankets. Energy consumption solely for air-conditioning is now one of the region's looming headaches. According to Chatham House, neighboring Saudi Arabia could actually be consuming more oil than it exports in 15 years due largely to air conditioning. Read more: Keeping the Qatar World Cup cool . The answer to this problem, however, could be closer to home than many previously thought. Engineers are now looking at traditional Arab architecture as a way of providing zero-energy cooling for contemporary buildings, not just in the Arab peninsula but around the world. The wind tower has been a fixture of Middle Eastern architecture for almost 1,000 years, says Ben Hughes, associate professor of building physics at Leeds University, and its solutions are as simple as they are effective. ""The higher up you go, the faster the airspeed is,"" said Hughes. ""They used to build the towers as tall as possible, capture the air at high speed. As it hits the tower, there's a wall that runs down the center of it that forces the wind down into the building."" Read more: How not to approach a desert adventure . The build up of a positive pressure inside the building automatically creates a negative pressure on the outside, which means that stale and bad air inside the building is drawn away. ""It creates a siphon effect,"" Hughes explained. ""It pushes air into the building and sucks stale and used air out the other side of the wind tower."" The most elegant examples of the wind tower still stand in Dubai's historic quarter of Al Bastakiya -- known locally as The Creek -- where Persian traders created ornate structures built of stone or mud in the 1850s to cool and ventilate their urban mansions. Often, the towers were wrapped in wet fabric to increase their cooling ability. ""They are absolutely fantastic,"" Hughes said. ""Anyone who's been in one of these naturally ventilated space will tell you that it's a far healthier environment than an air-conditioned space."" Air-conditioning, he said, provides immediate thermal comfort whereas wind towers fulfill a different function, ridding buildings of the constant build up of CO2 and diminishing stuffiness. Even so, his recently patented contemporary wind tower -- a meter-high box that channels air down into buildings and cools it using gravity to feed a refrigerant liquid through a loop in the box -- has achieved a temperature reduction of as much as 12 degrees in buildings. Read more: Futuristic souk at heart of Dubai's Expo . The beauty of his smaller compact design, he says, is that it saves on the cost of building a heavy and tall wind tower that puts a large structural and expensive burden on the construction. ""The idea of the small, lightweight design is that if you have more of them, you'll get the same effect without having to pay the additional strengthening structural costs,"" he said. As energy costs rise, solutions based on the idea of the Arabic wind tower have become increasingly popular in European contemporary design over the past 10 to 15 years. In the countries that gave birth to the concept such as Dubai -- where air-conditioning, Hughes says, now accounts for 70% of electricity consumption in the summer -- the wind tower is making a welcome return. ""The idea of taking this design back to the Middle East is that it's part of their heritage,"" Hughes said. ""Qatar in particular has a strategic plan by 2030 to move to a knowledge-based economy and part of that plan is to provide healthy living environments that pays respect to their heritage so it fits really nicely with what they're doing too."" Read more: Building a hub for higher learning . Masdar Institute of Science and Technology outside Abu Dhabi has one of the most spectacular examples of a modern wind tower, using the vernacular style of the traditional structures as part of a 45-meter tower that cools and ventilates the campus' public space. For Hughes, the answers to one of the Middle East's most pressing problems -- exponentially rising energy consumption to cool buildings in one of the world's most inhospitable regions -- was in its back garden all the time. ""It's always been there but people are lazy,"" he says. ""If something allows people to control their space for minimal cost, they'll take it. ""But as costs rise and decisions get harder about where you're going to spend your money you need alternative solutions to provide comfort and that's why we've taken a traditional technology and dragged it into the 21st century.""","Per capita, Dubai is one of the world's largest consumers of energy, largely for air conditioning .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Few racing fans will forget the day Frankie Dettori stormed into the history books as the first man to take seven winners past the post on a seven-race card. Frankie Dettori performs his signature ""flying dismount"" after winning all seven races at Ascot, September 28, 1996. It happened in the summer of 1996 at Royal Ascot, the British racecourse founded in 1711 by Queen Anne who considered it the ideal place for ""horses to gallop at full stretch."" And gallop he did; seizing seven wins from seven races. The win sent a tremor of excitement through the racing industry, made a hero of the small man from Sardinia and stripped ashen-faced bookmakers of millions. ""I think that the bookmakers lost in the region of £50 million, $100 million, in today's money, so history was made,"" Frankie Dettori recalls. ""We've been racing thoroughbreds for 300 years and I'm the first one to get there, and good luck to the guy who follows me."" Few think that anyone will. The odds on him winning the straight set were 25,095 to one. Millions watched his victory in the stands and on television; the BBC's Grandstand cut into its traditional Saturday afternoon sports coverage to show the pictures live from Ascot. Ray Cochrane, Dettori's friend and manager, had the rare pleasure of watching the drama unfold in front of him, literally. ""I was actually riding that day. Everybody wanted to beat him on that last race,"" Cochrane says. ""He was making the run and going flat out. We thought; this horse can't keep going, he's got 10 stone -- top weight -- he can't keep going."" But he did. ""Then we start to hear this roar, from Swindly Bottom, a mile from home. You could then hear the crowd from the grandstand starting to shout -- they were just lifting him home."" Among the crowd was Nick Smith, head of public relations for Ascot racecourse. ""The atmosphere in the winners' enclosure was amazing. We actually had champagne for him after the sixth, and then after the seventh the whole place just erupted.""  hear more of Nick Smith's memories of that day » . ""We abused him after the race, covered him in champagne, gave him a good hiding,"" recalls Cochrane. ""It was a great day, a great day for racing really, never mind just him."" hear more from Ray Cochrane on Frankie's feat . Frankie Dettori's historic win was splashed across the papers. His multiple victories became known as the ""Magnificent 7."" Headlines declared Frankie ""untouchable"" and a ""turf act to follow."" ""It took races off the sports pages and onto the front pages,"" says Robin Oakley, CNN's European Political Editor and avid racing fan. ""Frankie was already a well known jockey before the Magnificent 7, but it did turn him into a household name,"" he says. Frankie Dettori is under no illusions as to who's to credit for his win and the fame that's followed. The horse who took him first past the post for the seventh time that day is now long retired and spends his days grazing in the grounds of Dettori's home in the traditional British racing town of Newmarket. ""This is Fujiyama Crest,"" Dettori says, holding a feed bucket to the nose of an aging gelding. ""He was owned by a Japanese owner and then after that he went into jumping but he wasn't very good."" ""I bought him in private and now he's our house pet. I ride him from time to time, my wife, the kids ... but he spends most of his life in the field with the other ponies."" The famous post is not far away either. ""After winning the seven races and all those big races I won at Ascot I asked if I could have it, and they said yes, so after the last race of the last meeting at Ascot I took it off the ground and I put it in the horse box and I planted it here."" It now has pride of place in his garden. ""I'm very proud of it,"" he says. ""It's a bit tall but it's got a meaning to it.""

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- As rebel and pro-government forces in Libya maneuvered on the battlefield Wednesday, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi urged U.S. President Barack Obama to end the NATO bombing of his war-torn country. Gadhafi made the appeal in a letter to the American president, a senior administration official said. But the official said there was ""nothing new"" in the letter, the thrust of which was an appeal for an end to the alliance's air operations. It contained no offers to negotiate or step down, and the official said the administration isn't taking the note seriously. Gadhafi asked Obama to stop the ""unjust war against a small people of a developing country"" and said those in the opposition are terrorists and members of al Qaeda, the official said. ""We have been hurt more morally than physically because of what had happened against us in both deeds and words by you,"" Gadhafi wrote, according to the official. ""Despite all this you will always remain our son."" The strongman expressed hope that Obama wins re-election next year, the official added. And he wrote that a democratic society cannot be built through missiles and aircraft. ""You are a man who has enough courage to annul a wrong and mistaken action,"" the leader wrote to the president. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the NATO strikes will stop when Gadhafi steps down and leaves the country. ""I don't think there is any mystery about what is expected from Mr. Gadhafi at this time,"" Clinton said. The letter came amid diplomatic, economic and military developments in Libya, which remains in a deadly stalemate as pro-Gadhafi forces battle opposition fighters demanding democracy and an end to Gadhafi's nearly 42-year-rule. A British airstrike hit an oil field in the eastern Libyan town of Sarir on Wednesday, causing damage to a main pipeline, Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim told reporters. A tanker carrying crude oil left the eastern Libyan port of Tobruk on Wednesday in what was the first known export of oil by the fledgling opposition during the conflict, a sign of optimism for them. Rebel fighters and pro-Gadhafi forces have been pushing back and forth between al-Brega and Ajdabiya, while residents in the western city of Misrata are spending their days in fear. Also Wednesday, ex-U.S. Rep. Curt Weldon, who met with Gadhafi within the past decade, paid a visit to the Libyan capital with a cease-fire plan and a clear message to the embattled ruler that he must step down. Former U.S. Congressman Weldon says he will meet with Gadhafi . Weldon, speaking in an interview with CNN affiliate WPIX-TV in New York, said he planned to meet with Gadhafi and Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim. ""It's a very solemn time because there's so much at risk here,"" said Weldon, who led a congressional delegation to Libya in 2004 and is visiting Tripoli at Gadhafi's invitation. Weldon is a Republican who represented a suburban Philadelphia district. ""I'm here to tell him face to face it's time for him to leave. It's time for him to step down, allow the people to take over the government of this country."" In an opinion piece published Wednesday in The New York Times, Weldon said he is proposing a cease-fire, ""with the Libyan Army withdrawing from contested cities and rebel forces ending attempts to advance."" There's been seesaw fighting between pro- and anti-Gadhafi troops between al-Brega and Ajdabiya, CNN's Ben Wedeman reported. On Tuesday night, Gadhafi forces moved 40 kilometers (about 25 miles) from al-Brega to Ajdabiya, and then Wednesday, the rebels pushed them back 10 kilometers (six miles). At one point, rebels let loose with barrage of rockets, and they were answered by artillery and mortars. Gadhafi paid  U.S. firms to polish his image . ""It moves back and forth,"" Wedeman reported. A CNN team saw equipment the rebels didn't have before such as night-vision goggles and two Milan anti-tank missiles. Fighters said they obtained the missiles from the transitional government in Benghazi but didn't know their origin. Rebel leaders have criticized NATO's mission to help protect civilians in recent days, saying residents in Misrata and elsewhere have suffered under horrific attacks from pro-Gadhafi forces with little evidence of NATO air power overhead. ""I am extremely sorry to say this, but NATO truly disappointed us,"" Gen. Abdul Fatah Younis, the opposition's top military official, said Tuesday. ""Civilians are being killed every day, including children, women and elderly. If NATO will wait another week, Misrata will be finished. No one will be left alive. Do they want to wait, and watch them die, and let this crime be a shameful disgrace for the international community forever?"" NATO Brig. Gen. Mark van Uhm said weather conditions and tactics by Gadhafi regime have hindered their efforts. In addition to using human shields and hiding equipment in populated areas, pro-Gadhafi forces have started abandoning heavy military equipment in favor of the same kinds of cars and light trucks the rebels travel in, making it difficult for pilots to distinguish rebel convoys from those carrying forces loyal to the regime, van Uhm said. Libyan opposition: Compromise with Gadhafi not an option . NATO is operating under a Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force to protect Libyan civilians. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is ""deeply concerned about the deterioriating situation facing civilians in Libyan cities under military attack,"" according to a statement. Conditions in Misrata are ""especially grave,"" the statement said, ""with reports of the use of heavy weapons to attack the city, where the population is trapped and unable, as a result of heavy shelling that has continued over several weeks, to receive basic supplies, including clean water, food and medicines."" But residents in Misrata said this week that Gadhafi forces have trapped the city, with snipers shooting indiscriminately. Access to food has been hampered. ""Normal life is a luxury that we don't have,"" one resident said. ""I haven't taken my family out for four weeks now. All schools are closed, my children didn't go to school since the 19th of February. All government offices are closed. Even dead people are buried without death certificates."" After weeks of relentless fighting, a military victory for either side seems remote. A political or diplomatic solution might be the only way to end the crisis. Weldon said that in addition to his proposals for Gadhafi's stepping down, a cease-fire on both sides and the withdrawal of government forces from key cities, he is calling for a halt in further advances by rebel forces; the creation of a joint interim government run by Libya's current prime minister and the opposition leader; unfettered humanitarian access; and the establishment of a parliamentary commission that would include U.S., Middle Eastern, European and African politicians helping to establish a new parliament in Libya. Alleged Libyan rape victim thankful for support . As for the Gadhafi family, Weldon's proposals also suggest a possible title for Gadhafi as honorary chairman of the African Union and allowing his second-oldest son, Saif, to stand in elections. On the economic front, the tanker with crude oil that left Tobruk was sailing to Qatar, where the oil will be refined, CNN confirmed. Final destination of the export is not known at this time. The civil war in Libya has severely curtailed oil exports from the North African nation, which produced some 1.6 million barrels per day last year. This move symbolizes the opposition's intent to manage the country's affairs. The U.S. Treasury has frozen more than $32 billion in assets held by Gadhafi and members of his regime. Asked whether the opposition should be able to have access to those funds, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the United States ""is well aware there is an urgency, that the Transitional National Council does need funding if it's to survive, and we're looking at ways to assist that."" But Toner said he did not know the status of the $32 billion.

"(CNN) -- ""Ride 'em cowboy"" types need not apply. Rather, the ideal candidate for this part-time position must be flexible, mature, a good listener and non-confrontational. Experience, however, is not necessary. (That might be because so few people would have that kind of experience.) The state of Florida is advertising for crocodile response agents to handle complaints from residents and, in the relatively rare event it is necessary, to capture and move crocs. Training will be provided. The addition of more agents comes amid the encouraging rebound of the American crocodile in Florida -- an estimated 2,000 non-hatchlings, up from about 300 in the mid-1970s -- and the accompanying rise in complaint calls. ""(The crocodile) is moving back into places where they have not been seen in decades,"" said Lindsey Hord, crocodile response coordinator for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. ""That is obviously resulting in conflict."" While the vast majority of the crocs are in Everglades National Park, many live in the Florida Keys and along the Atlantic Ocean in Miami-Dade and Broward Counties. The program currently has nine agents who serve as ""eyes and ears"" on the crocodile population, responding to calls and patiently listening to residents unhappy with what they consider reptilian encroachment. The job pays $25 an hour, including vehicle expenses. ""It is not something you do for the money,"" said Hord, adding the hiring process weeds out those who do not live close to where the work will take them. Some applicants, he told CNN, say they want to wrestle the animals. That's a no-go. Often, the role of the team is to educate residents about not dangling incentives in front of crocodiles, such as having an unfenced dog near water or dumping yummy fish remains into a canal after a day of fishing. Crocs hunt with sticks, researchers say . Peaceful co-existence is the aim . And while some creatures are moved -- about eight or so out of an estimated 200 complaints in 2013 -- most remain because they do not meet the criteria for removal. Those that are relocated often return to their capture site. It is unlawful to kill crocodiles in Florida. Hord notes the creatures -- listed as threatened in Florida -- are increasingly returning to their historic ranges. The commission describes crocodiles as shy and reclusive but potentially dangerous. Their increasing presence can be a problem when they come close to residents, including newcomers. ""It is the agency's hope that people will co-exist with crocodiles,"" said Hord. ""We have no objective to unilaterally remove crocodiles from anywhere. We strictly react to complaints. We don't go out looking for crocodiles,"" he said. Hord spoke Wednesday with a woman who just rented a home in Broward County. She has small children and a dog. ""She was just now aware there were crocodiles. She was not overly upset but concerned."" The coordinator told her there are no documented reports of crocodiles biting humans. A bigger danger is swimming pool safety for her children. Regarding the pooch, it might be good to have a fence to keep the crocodiles and alligators -- which number about 1.3 million in Florida -- away. ""It is about putting things into context,"" Hord said. 'They ... sense we are something different' Calls and complaints generally rise after a dog is killed by a crocodile, such as last year in southeast Miami. Wildlife officials encourage homeowners not to swim in potential danger zones, or allow their dogs in the water. ""Sometimes, it is hard for people to change,"" Hord said, pointing out Key residents accustomed to swimming and scuba diving just yards from their homes. ""It is not going to go back the way it was 30 years ago."" In certain areas, if a complaint comes in and the crocodile is 9 feet long or over, hangs around an area or ends up in a swimming pool, officials move it. On its third capture, an animal will be removed from the wild and placed in a conservation park or similar facility. Biologists have been studying whether magnets will keep crocs from returning to areas where they are not welcome. The idea is that the magnets will disrupt their sense of the Earth's magnetic field, making it harder for them to orient themselves after their release. Results so far are mixed. Crocs, Hord said, have keen eyesight and hearing. ""They can learn very quickly to be habituated to people. They learn very quickly that people are not a threat to them if they are not."" Interestingly, when it's time for a capture, the reptiles often are wary. ""They seem to be able to sense we are something different,"" Hord said. ""Then they disappear."" After 32 years of this type of work, Hord has fond feelings and memories for certain crocodiles.

"(CNN) -- Lacy underwear has effectively been ""banned"" by new regulations in Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, opponents say. But the issue is not one of modesty. A customs union made up of the three post-Soviet countries introduced a regulation, which requires clothing in contact with skin to contain at least 6% of cotton, for safety reasons. From July, underwear that does not meet this requirement will not be available in stores in the economic area. Production and import of these will also stop. The regulations say this is designed to protect consumers against synthetic garments which don't absorb enough moisture. That could cause skin problems. However, most luxury lingerie is made of materials with less than 4% cotton -- and will not be allowed. Despite its supposed health benefit, the regulation has been badly received in Kazakhstan. Several Kazakh women were reportedly detained by the police in Almaty after protesting against the ban. Scores of women have posted pictures of themselves in lacy underwear on social networks and compared the photos to images of Soviet-era style brown, shapeless underwear. ""Producers have known about the regulations for about 10 years,"" the customs union's regulation minister Valery Koreshkov said in a publicly released statement, adding the news should not be a surprise. The union's regulation Ð¢R Ð¡U 017/2011 was passed by the lawmakers in 2011, but will only come into effect this July. Other undergarments and linens are also affected. But the reaction is putting union officials under pressure from textile producers and shoppers. In the same statement, Koreshkov said the union had already received several amendment proposals. Technical regulations are ""not a dogma"" and can change, the statement said. ""These proposals should be considered by all the experts."" The customs union of the three counties was formed in 2010, and is moving towards a full European Union -style trade union. The Eurasian Customs Union is set to be formalized in 2015 and expected to expand to other countries in the region.","Post-Soviet customs union ""bans"" undergarments that contain less then 6% cotton .

"London (CNN) -- CNN host and former UK tabloid editor Piers Morgan was questioned in December in connection with a UK police inquiry into phone hacking, he said Friday. Morgan said he was interviewed while in Britain by officers involved in the investigation into claims that journalists illegally hacked people's voice mail to get stories, known as Operation Weeting. ""In early November I was asked to attend an interview by officers from Operation Weeting when I was next in the UK,"" he said in a prepared statement. ""This was further to a full witness statement I had already freely provided. I attended that interview as requested on 6 December 2013."" London's Metropolitan Police said in a prepared statement: ""A 48-year old man, a journalist, was interviewed under caution on the 6th December 2013 by officers from Operation Golding in connection with 'suspected conspiracy to intercept telephone voicemails.' ""He was interviewed by appointment at a South London police station and he was not arrested."" CNN said it ""has been aware of this interview since before it took place, and has no further comment."" Operation Golding is a strand of Operation Weeting and is specifically investigating allegations of phone interception at Mirror Group Newspapers, a Metropolitan Police spokesman said. The Daily Mirror, formerly edited by Morgan, is one of the group's titles. There have been four arrests under Operation Golding and three people have been interviewed under caution, the Met Police said. This means anything said can be given in evidence in court. Metropolitan Police inquiries have largely focused on alleged wrongdoing at the News of the World and Sun newspapers, owned by media baron Rupert Murdoch. A number of people connected to the papers are on trial over alleged abuses there, including former editors Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson. They deny wrongdoing. Morgan, also a former editor of the News of the World, is the host of prime-time interview show ""Piers Morgan Live,"" which was first aired in January 2011. In December of that year, he was called to testify before the UK Parliament regarding his exact knowledge of a phone hacking scandal involving pop star Paul McCartney and his ex-wife, Heather Mills. Morgan was a columnist at The Sun before, in 1994, becoming editor of the News of the World. Two years later, he moved to the rival Daily Mirror, where he served as editor-in-chief from 1995 until 2004.","Piers Morgan says he was questioned by police looking into phone hacking claims .

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi scored twice as Barcelona went back to the top of La Liga in a three-way title race with a 4-1 victory at Sevilla Sunday. The win drew them level on points with Real Madrid and Atletico, but at the summit because of a superior goal difference. The margin of victory in atrocious and wet conditions would have also helped the defending champion's cause but they had to come from behind to secure the win. Alberto Moreno had put the hosts into an early 15th minute lead as his low strike deflected past Victor Valdes. More might have followed as Carlos Bacca hit the post with a header but Barca were level as Messi's free kick found Alexis Sanchez, who appeared to be in an offside position before scoring. Messi, returning to his best after his injury layoff, put the Catalans ahead before the break with a superb half-volley. He hit the third early in the second half and Cesc Fabregas rounded off the scoring to make the three points safe. With 15 rounds remaining of the tightest Spanish title race in years, all three teams at the top have 57 points. All three are also still involved in the Champions League at the last 16 knockout stage as the season on a domestic and European level moves to an exciting climax. In Italy's Serie A, defending champions Juventus maintained a nine-point advantage over Roma at the top despite being held to a 2-2 draw at Verona. Argentina star Carlos Tevez put Juve two up inside 21 minutes, but second half goals from Luca Toni and substitute Juan Gomez in stoppage time, salvaged a point for the home side. Roma were held to a goalless draw by Lazio and failed to make up ground. Meanwhile in France's Ligue 1, champions Paris Saint German played out a 1-1 draw with nearest title rivals Monaco. An own goal from PSG captain Thiago Silva cost them three points after Javier Pastore put them ahead after eight minutes. But they still lead big-spending Monaco by five points with 14 rounds remaining.","Barcelona beat Sevilla 4-1 in La Liga .

"(CNN) -- The bassist of the rock band 3 Doors Down faces a driving under the influence charge after his arrest Tuesday in Mississippi. Police found Todd Harrell ""slumped over the steering wheel"" of a vehicle stopped at an intersection in D'Iberville, Mississippi, a police statement released Wednesday said. Harrell, 42, ""showed signs of impairment and was arrested and charged with 2nd offense DUI,"" police said. The musician was charged with vehicular homicide in Nashville, Tennessee, last April after his speeding car allegedly clipped a pickup truck, sending it down an embankment and killing the driver, according to a Davidson County, Tennessee, sheriff's spokesman. Harrell showed signs of impairment and acknowledged he had consumed hard cider and taken the prescription pills Lortab and Xanax after that incident, police said. The case is still pending. His group may be best known for its song ""Kryptonite,"" but it had a string of hits in the early 2000s, including ""When I'm Gone"" and ""Here Without You."" Harrell is one of three founding members of the group that formed in Escatawpa, Mississippi, in 1994, according to allmusic.com.

"Fort Lee, New Jersey (CNN) -- For several days in September, there was one experience that united motorists in New Jersey: Together they felt the total despair, rage and frustration that came with trying to drive near or on the George Washington Bridge. It meant a commute from hell for thousands. Parents couldn't get their kids to school. ""It was utter chaos those days. People were pouring into the store, complaining,"" Debbie Minuto recalled Thursday in her shop, Binghamton Bagel Cafe, in the town of Fort Lee. ""The bridge is a lifeline here. You take away the bridge, you take away our livelihood."" She had just finished watching Gov. Chris Christie apologize on national television, saying he was ""embarrassed and humiliated"" by the conduct of ""some people"" on his ""team"" but that he knew nothing about it. He said he fired a senior aide at the center of the uproar involving the alleged abuse of authority behind the lane closures that snarled traffic. Christie's apology wasn't enough, Minuto said. ""He hurt a lot of people. You can't play with our bridge."" J.J. Jata wasn't far away, smoking cigars with friends and playing dominoes at the Cigar Room. They too had just watched the governor's mea culpa. ""I was on the bridge those days,"" he said. ""It was like a disaster. It was worse than a disaster. I had to get up four hours earlier just to get into the city."" Normally, his commute takes one hour. ""He hurt the people of this community,"" Jata said. ""It was all about politics without regard for the people."" Christie capped Thursday by visiting Fort Lee to personally apologize to the mayor, Mark Sokolich. Christie arrived at the municipal building shortly after 4 p.m., stepping out of a black SUV to a smattering of boos and applause from locals gathered outside, along with one man who barked like a dog. Miriam Hernandez, a school crossing guard, was among those waiting. She said she voted for Christie in the last election. She's not so sure she'll vote for him again and cast doubt on his explanation that he was in the dark. ""I don't buy it,"" she said. ""It's a pretty big coincidence."" On those September days, Hernandez said, her husband's 45-minute commute took three hours. ""He kept calling me. He was so upset,"" she said. But Sokolich, who met with Christie for about 45 minutes, said he accepted the governor's apology and called the session ""very productive"" and ""cordial."" He said borough officials wanted to make sure ""this never, ever happens again in the future."" ""We were unconditionally, unequivocally provided with that assurance,"" Sokolich said. Christie's visit was ""a big step in regaining the trust of our community."" ""I take him for his word, which is he had nothing to do with it,"" Sokolich said. For his part, Christie said he had ""a very good, productive meeting"" with the mayor, ""and I look forward to working with him in the future."" Back at the Cigar Room, however, owner Jose Perez called the governor's explanation ""bull."" ""This is the usual state of politics in New Jersey. In the end, who pays? The people. We're the ones who pay for the political gains."" And Claude Lewin, who was among those stuck trying to get onto the bridge in September, said he didn't believe Christie ""was telling us us 100% of the truth today."" ""Like any political scandal, it's only afterward that these politicians show remorse or contrition and acknowledge that something possibly happened,"" Lewin said. ""This was an incident that lasted four days, and after the first day, the governor should have gotten on the phone and called his staff and people at the Port Authority to figure out what was going on."" Phil Belgiovine, 82, has been walking for exercise along Fort Lee's Main Street for decades. Motorists have always tried to leave the New Jersey Turnpike and cut through the street. ""Now, our traffic problem has become a political scandal,"" the retired electric company worker said. ""We're amused by all this."" Lorraine Vorchheimer, a Realtor, sits at a desk facing the bumper-to-bumper bridge-bound traffic on Main Street. A resident of Fort Lee nearly 40 years, Vorchheimer said, she never saw anything like the traffic in September. ""It was horrific,"" she said. ""We couldn't get to work."" ""A parking lot,"" a co-worker interjected. Vorchheimer believes Christie. ""I don't think he would be that small-minded,"" she said. ""If he knew, he should not be governor for all the harm that was caused."" Tweets in traffic . Tweets tell the story of those days of stagnation on the bridge. Mick Duch tweeted ""Helloooooo (@ George Washington Bridge w/ 5 others)"" on September 9 at 8:38 a.m.; Shawn Bonneau tweeted ""I'm at George Washington Bridge (New York, NY) w/ 2 others"" at 7:29 a.m.; and at 11:48 a.m., a person named Ali tweeted, ""This traffic on the George Washington bridge is cray crazy."" Paramedics faced much more serious dilemmas, of course, and according to a letter written at the time by an emergency official, responders were delayed in getting to at least four scenes. In one instance, they had trouble reaching a 91-year-old woman who was unconscious and later died. At the three-story Fort Lee Memorial Municipal Building, business went on as usual even though reporters were everywhere. The City Council chambers also serve as the local courthouse, where on Thursday, a municipal judge handled dozens of misdemeanors and traffic violations -- many stemming from traffic around the bridge. The emergency official who wrote a letter detailing paramedics' problems in traffic, Paul Favia, was at the city building and tried to avoid the press. ""Welcome to my world,"" he told a co-worker as he dodged reporters. Hours in traffic . Claude Lewin was doing his usual rush-hour commute on September 13 when his typically slow-going ride ground to a halt. His commute went from 30 minutes to two hours and 15 minutes, according to the Bergen Record. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the bridge connecting the two states, reduced the number of tollbooths from three to one and narrowed traffic patterns toward two Fort Lee streets, and that reduced three lanes to one, the newspaper said. ""Other than after the 9/11 attacks, I've never seen such a fiasco of delays at the inbound, upper-level part of the bridge,"" Mildred Van Zwaren of Ridgefield told the paper. ""Ludicrous!"" Chuck Ciocco said. ""Chronic delays like these destroy one of the two main reasons that most of us moved to this area -- great schools and a short commute."" Keith Bendul, the Fort Lee police chief, told the paper that the department first heard about the traffic change on a Monday morning, the first day of school. ""Our parents now have to get up an hour and a half early to get their kids to class. We couldn't clear all the residual traffic until 11:30,"" he said. On September 10, Favia, the head of the Office of Emergency Medical Services of Fort Lee, wrote a letter to Sokolich detailing instances in which paramedics had trouble reaching people who needed them. The 91-year-old woman went into cardiac arrest, he wrote, but the paramedics were in such a bind that they had to meet the ambulance on its way to the hospital instead of going to the scene, he wrote. The Bergen Record, which cited borough records, reported that the woman later died. In another instance, emergency responders were dispatched to a motorcycle crash with injuries, according to the letter. It took nine minutes for the responders to get to the scene when it should have taken four, Favia wrote. New Jersey politician wants investigation into bridge controversy . Favia actually joined EMS on that call on September 9 despite being stuck in traffic, which he managed to get out of by jumping a curb and cutting up another street, he wrote. Later that evening, because all ambulances were dispatched elsewhere, he responded to a call about someone having chest pains. It took Favia eight minutes to get to the scene because of standstill traffic, he wrote. He was eventually joined by another ambulance that was also delayed due to traffic tie-ups. 'Time for some traffic problems' Christie denied for months that anyone in his administration or campaign played any role in the closures. On Wednesday, e-mails and texts emerged, suggesting that appointees of Christie's orchestrated the closures to punish Sokolich, a Democrat who wouldn't support Christie at the polls. Christie and his staff originally blamed the closures and the traffic delays on a mishandled traffic study. ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,"" Bridget Anne Kelly, Christie's deputy chief of staff for legislative and intergovernmental affairs, said in an e-mail to David Wildstein, then the highest-level appointee representing the state at the Port Authority. ""Got it,"" Wildstein replied. In another message about school buses with students on board caught in the traffic jams, Wildstein wrote, ""they are the children of Buono voters,"" apparently referring to Barbara Buono, Christie's Democratic opponent in November's gubernatorial election. Those cited in the messages did not respond to requests for comment or to verify the communications. Wildstein invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when called before a state legislative committee on Thursday, with lawmakers citing him for contempt for refusing to answer questions. As for Sokolich, Christie said Thursday that the mayor ""was never on my radar screen"" before the controversy. Sokolich said he raised the comment with the governor during their meeting in the afternoon, asking, ""Governor, am I now on your radar?"" ""His response was something along the lines that Fort Lee now has its own screen,"" Sokolich told CNN's The Situation Room. CNN's Ray Sanchez reported from Fort Lee, New Jersey, and Ashley Fantz reported from Atlanta. CNN's Matt Smith and Toby Lyles contributed to this report.","Fort Lee mayor accepts Christie's apology; resident says, ""I don't buy it""

"(CNN) -- From time to time, in the years just after his television show was taken away from him, you might see him in the lobby of a Las Vegas hotel or casino. It was always a startling sight. Ed Sullivan, walking among the guests. In town for the weekend, more free hours on his hands than he would have liked, catching a few stage shows. It wasn't that he had quickly become anonymous -- far from it. That kind of fame doesn't fade, at least not for a long while. ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" was gone, but the man survived. It had to have been so odd for him. ""Ed, we miss you!"" a hotel guest might call out from across the lobby. Sullivan would smile. Great smile, by the way -- he was caricatured as being dour and stone-faced, but he had a smile that could light things up. So, with that smile and with a nod, he would acknowledge the person who had called to him. But it was a second set of people who caused a slightly different reaction from him. They couldn't have intended to be hurtful. ""Ed Sullivan!"" they might call. ""We watch you every Sunday night at eight!"" And there would be something in his eyes. A little clenching of the jaw. He was off the air, against his will, and they didn't even realize it. Today is the 50th anniversary of his greatest triumph. The first appearance of The Beatles on ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" on February 9, 1964, drew the largest audience for any program -- 73 million people -- in the history of television up to that time. In recent days there has been much discussion of, and reminiscing about, the four young musicians who stepped onto Sullivan's stage that night. Yet the fifth person on the stage was, in his own way, just as intriguing. He was a newspaper guy: a sportswriter, starting out, and eventually a Broadway columnist who, in the 1930s, could never seem to step out of the shadow of the most successful Broadway columnist, his rival -- it bordered on enmity -- Walter Winchell. Winchell, of the New York Mirror, had become, through his national Sunday night radio news-and-commentary program, the most talked-about and highly paid journalist in the United States. He was abrasive, imperious, ruthless in his wielding of power, and a dazzling, concise wordsmith between the dots of the items in his ""Your Broadway and Mine"" column. Sullivan's ""Little Old New York"" column in the Daily News was punchy and knowing, but he was never going to become as big as Winchell. Or so everyone thought. One evening in the late 1940s, Sullivan did his annual duty as master of ceremonies for something called the Harvest Moon Ball, a dance competition sponsored by the Daily News. Some executives at CBS, seeing him at the microphone, thought they might try him out as the host of a variety show on the new and untested medium of television. Radio was still king; there wasn't much risk in seeing what would work on TV. Opinion: Did Beatles push black music aside? And with that, everything was transformed. No one knew it at the time, but the dominance of newspapers, and of network radio, were about to end. Sullivan may have appeared stiff and lacking in personality on television, but his Sunday night program featured some of the biggest and best show-business acts in the world, and his lack of magnetism, strangely, worked in his favor. Two of the most oft-repeated quotes about him summed it up. From comedian Alan King, a frequent Sullivan show guest: ""Ed does nothing, but he does it better than anyone else in television."" From radio comedian and host Fred Allen: ""Ed Sullivan will be around as long as someone else has talent."" Sullivan, who would become wealthy and instantly recognizable from coast to coast as his program became a national viewing habit, could afford to laugh along. His show went on the air in 1948, and his success, as the enormous reach of television grew, left Winchell in the dust. On TV, Sullivan didn't have to shout; the fledgling medium did all the amplifying he needed. It was an era in which families still ate dinner together every Sunday night, and then gathered around the television set to watch a variety of acts that Sullivan had deemed appropriate for all age groups. Winchell couldn't compete; he might be able to give a plug in his column to the cast of ""Guys and Dolls"" or to the comedy duo of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, but Sullivan could put the cast and the comedians on TV screens in every city and town in America, allowing the entire country to see them. Even before February 9, 1964, his influence was being noted in remarkable ways. In the 1960 Broadway musical (later a hit movie) ""Bye Bye Birdie,"" the show-stopping song was ""Hymn for a Sunday Evening,"" in which a fictional small-town Ohio family, whose daughter supposedly was going to appear on his program, wore choir robes and, with religious ardor, sang in church-like tones: ""Ed Sullivan, Ed Sullivan, we're gonna be on Ed Sullivan. ..."" Penn Jillette: The Beatles, bootlegs and Vermeer . Not bad, for a guy in near-constant stomach pain whose day job remained pounding out newspaper columns. And then came the first appearance by The Beatles, which propelled both the young singers and their host to almost unfathomable heights of renown. Many people have likely forgotten that, in 1971, CBS, having detected a softening in Sullivan's ratings, and a decline in the nation's appetite for one-size-fits-all variety programs, canceled ""The Ed Sullivan Show."" How could this happen, a mere seven years after he delivered to the network the biggest television audience ever? There's not much room for sentiment in business. Seven-and-a-half years after Babe Ruth hit 60 home runs for the New York Yankees, the team traded him to the Boston Braves. Everything ends. Sullivan was still under contract to CBS for occasional specials, but it wasn't the same. He would die of esophageal cancer in 1974, at the age of 73. ""We miss you, Ed!"" the voices of the strangers would call to him, as if he was a family member, which, in a sense, he was. To encounter him on visits to Las Vegas in those years just after his show was taken away, to witness him not on a glass screen but out among the people who once faithfully watched him, was to consider the swiftness and inevitability of change. Less than a decade after that magical February night in 1964, Ed Sullivan the person was still around, but there was no longer any such thing as ""The Ed Sullivan Show."" Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr were still around, but there was no longer any such thing as a band called The Beatles. Hymn for a Sunday evening, indeed. This one in particular. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: 50 years ago TV host Ed Sullivan introduced The Beatles to U.S. on his show .

"(CNN) -- Like Americans, Israelis begin their day by watching one of several television news shows. These highlight the pressing issues facing the country. But Israel, of course, is not just any country, but a contested and often controversial Jewish state situated in the epicenter of an overwhelmingly Muslim and constantly roiling Middle East. One would expect, then, to hear commentators on these shows discussing the latest glitch in the peace talks with the Palestinians, the recent terrorist bombing just beyond Israel's southern border with Egypt, or the revelation of more advanced rockets in the arsenal of Hezbollah in Lebanon. But the topic on Israel's leading morning show this week was none of these. The top issue, rather, was the percentage of Tel Aviv streets named for women. Turns out that women's studies scholars and feminist activists have examined Tel Aviv street names and discovered that the overwhelming majority of them are named for men. While preparing for work, I kept one eye on the television and listened, fascinated, as representatives of women's rights groups argued passionately for gender equality in Tel Aviv street-naming. They made a compelling case and even the show's hosts, who are generally testier than their American counterparts, were convinced. I, too, was impressed, and not only by the discussion, but also by the very fact that it was taking place. From Tel Aviv it is roughly a two-hour drive to Mafraq in Jordan, the temporary home of tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, making it the country's second-largest city. From Tel Aviv, one can drive three hours north — less than the distance between New York and Boston — and arrive in Damascus, in the thick of the Syrian civil war. Or one can drive east from Tel Aviv and in eight hours reach Iraq, where an estimated thousand people are being killed each month by suicide bombers. A similar excursion of about nine hours concludes in Tahrir Square in time for the latest confrontation between Egyptian protesters and police. A veritable firestorm is engulfing the Middle East, and Israel's Tel Aviv is just a short commute from its flash points. Yet it was women's rights, not the upheaval encompassing Israel on all sides, which highlighted the morning news. One explanation, certainly, is that Israelis need diversion from the chaos closing in on them, and what could be more distracting than a debate about signposts? After all, the question of whether to name a street after Golda Meir is certainly easier than asking if Israel can coexist with a nuclear-armed Iran. Another claim, one that is sometimes voiced by visiting statesmen, is that Israelis have it too good to think about the hard choices they face in the peace process. In fact, support for the two-state solution is vastly higher among Israelis today—more than 60%--than it was during the years of suicide bombing, when it was close to zero. But the real reason for Israel's interest in women's rights at this time is much more fundamental and reveals this country's secret. The reason is fortitude. Unique among the world's nations, Israel has never known a second of peace. Since its creation in 1948, and for many years before that, the country has been in a relentless state of war. And yet, in spite of that trauma, Israelis simply refuse to live abnormal lives. Almost militantly, they insist on normality. Call it a bubble, call it a fantasy, but the fact is that it works. In the midst of regional insanity, Israelis have built several of the world's leading universities, a cutting-edge high-tech sector, a universal health care system, and a wildly vibrant democracy. Yes, there is controversy. There is still no two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians and no end in sight for the Iranian nuclear program. Israeli intelligence recently reported that terrorists are pointing 170,000 rockets and missiles at the Jewish state. But on the streets of Tel Aviv, quite possibly the most threatened city on Earth, the cafes and cultural centers are packed, the food is superb and people are arguing why more of those streets are not named for women. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Oren.","Michael Oren: Israel sits in a region bristling with conflict and hostile to its presence .

"(CNN) -- In a few terrible seconds, teen star Justin Bieber made his attorney Roy Black's job a heck of a lot harder. Bieber, who was arrested in Miami Beach on Thursday for drunken driving, resisting arrest and driving without a valid license, decided it would be a good idea to spill his guts to the Miami Beach Police Department. According to Miami Beach Police Chief Raymond Martinez, during his arrest, Bieber ""made some statements that he had consumed some alcohol, and that he had been smoking marijuana and consumed some prescription medication,"" before getting behind the wheel of a yellow Lamborghini. Justin Bieber arrested on drunken driving, resisting arrest charges . On the surface, this could look like Bieber was just being an honest guy, admitting to his wrongdoings. But look a little further, and you'll see a young man who has done the worst possible thing a defendant in any case could do. He opened his mouth. And in doing that, he's also doing the state's job for them. Justin Bieber should have just shut up. The great thing about the American justice system is that it is based on an adversarial process that requires the state to actually PROVE your guilt with evidence. Guess whose job it is to gather that evidence? That's right, it's the job of the state -- in this case, the state of Florida. The defendant is entitled to a presumption of innocence. The defendant -- nor his attorney -- doesn't have to prove a thing. The defense attorney only needs to raise reasonable doubt to the state's version of the story. Where Bieber went wrong was voluntarily handing over evidence of his own guilt by admitting to criminal behavior, and therefore assisting in handing the prosecutor a conviction on a silver platter. Police report details Bieber arrest . The moment Bieber was placed under arrest, he was read those words that we hear on every procedural cop drama on television: ""You have the right to remain silent."" All Bieber had to do was shut his mouth. Such a simple concept. It makes no sense why more defendants don't use this precious liberty. Contrary to popular belief, keeping your lips sealed is not an indication of guilt. It's just plain smart. It gives your defense lawyer a much greater chance of success, because his client isn't participating in his own prosecution. When you are fighting the state and their plentiful resources of investigators, detectives, crime labs and prosecutors, the last thing a defense lawyer needs is his own client working against him. Roy Black is NOT happy with his client right now. Defending a client against an impaired driving charge is no easy task. The public interest in keeping impaired drivers off the road is understandably great. No one wants to see our society in harm's way because of irresponsible drivers. However, the integrity of our justice system requires that every defendant get an opportunity to have his guilt or innocence determined according to the evidence against him. By making statements against his own interests, Bieber actually helps to undermine the whole process. His lawyer's job is not to get him ""off."" Black's task is to hold the state accountable to its burden of providing evidence -- beyond a reasonable doubt -- that Bieber is in fact guilty of the crimes charged against him. By failing to perform the simple task of remaining silent, Bieber has done the exact thing Miranda rights are designed to prevent -- he has incriminated himself. Unlike instances where outside evidence can be refuted by the defense as speculative or circumstantial, self-incrimination is incredibly tough to refute because the defendant himself provided it. Unless you want to attack the credibility of your own client, the defense lawyer is in an awful position. Sure, defense lawyers can try to suppress the statements, but without facts to support coercion, this can also be a tall order. The right to remain silent is a gift from our Constitution (from the Fifth Amendment, to be exact). So if you are ever in as an unfortunate situation as Bieber found himself in early Thursday morning, listen to the police officer's instructions, cooperate fully, call your attorney -- and keep your mouth shut. Remember, you have that right. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Eboni K. Williams .","Teen star Justin Bieber was arrested early Thursday morning .

"(CNN) -- An explosion ripped through a ball-bearing factory in southern New Hampshire on Monday, leaving at least 15 people hurt, a hospital spokesman said. Authorities dispatched at least eight ambulances and two medical helicopters to the New Hampshire Ball Bearings plant outside Peterborough after the Monday afternoon blast, Assistant Town Administrator Nicole MacStay said. Monadnock Community Hospital saw 15 patients after the explosion, spokesman Phil McFarland said. Thirteen of those were treated and released, while two were transferred to other hospitals, McFarland said. Company spokeswoman Kathy Gerrity told CNN none of the injuries appeared to be life-threatening ""as far as we know."" About 450 people would have been working at the plant at the time of the 3:30 p.m. explosion, Gerrity said. The factory makes bearing assemblies for aircraft, medical and high-technology industries. New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan said the state has offered to provide ""any assistance needed to local first responders."" ""My thoughts and prayers go out to those injured in today's explosion, to their families and loved ones, and to the entire Peterborough area where NH Ball Bearings is such an important member of the community,"" Hassan said in a written statement.","At least 15 hurt in factory blast, hospital says .

"(CNN) -- ""Viewers don't want to be informed. Viewers want to feel informed."" Those are the words of Chet Collier, one of the founders of Fox News, as quoted in Gabriel Sherman's new biography of Roger Ailes, the network's chief. Mission apparently accomplished: Fox is the most-watched cable news network, and yet, some surveys suggest that people who rely on Fox as their primary information source know less about current events than people who watch no news at all. But to jab at Fox for inaccuracy is to miss Fox's purpose. Fox has created an information community. We used to say, ""Everybody's entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts."" In a mass media age, what counted as ""fact"" was defined by a few great national institutions: a small group of prestigious newspapers, a pair of leading news magazines, a trio of television broadcasters. Dissenters had a difficult time reaching any kind of large audience -- or even identifying who their audience might be. Advancing technology opened new possibilities, and Sherman's biography deftly tells the story of how it happened. The launch of CNN inspired NBC to create a cable news channel of its own, CNBC. Roger Ailes -- a former TV producer who had emerged as the most successful Republican campaign consultant of the 1980s -- was hired to run CNBC. After he lost an internal power struggle, Ailes joined Rupert Murdoch's Fox network. And the rest, as they say, is history. Before Fox, news programmers had struggled with the question of what their product was. Did it include health information, and if so, how much? Weather? Financial information? Human interest? Political opinion? Ailes built his new channel upon a very different question: who is my product for? The largest generation in American history, the baby boomers, were reaching deep middle age by the mid-1990s. They were beginning to share an experience familiar to all who pass age 50: living in a country very different from the one they had been born into. Fox offered them a new virtual environment in which they could feel more at home than they did in the outside world. Fox was carefully designed to look like a TV show from the 1970s: no holograms, no urban hipster studios, lots of primary colors. In other respects too, Fox offered a path back to a vanishing past. Here was a place in which men were firmly in charge, and in which women were valued most for their physical attractiveness. Here was a place in which ethnic minorities appeared only in secondary roles -- and then, with brave exceptions, only to affirm the rightness of the opinions of the white males in the primary roles. Back in the 1970s, students of public opinion had noticed a strange anomaly: in the very years, 1967-1973, when trust in government, business, the military and organized religion most sharply declined, trust in television rose. Some speculated that TV as an institution had an inherently adversarial relationship to other institutions: TV enhanced its own credibility by denigrating the credibility of everything and everyone that wasn't TV. That theory was coded into the DNA of Fox. Here, on this station, the chosen market segment could enjoy security and validation. Out there was depicted a hostile world of threats, danger, crime, and decaying values. In the nearly two decades since the launch of Fox, the average age of the viewers has increased -- and so has their alienation from a country that twice elected Barack Obama to the presidency. Economic prospects have narrowed and darkened for middle-income people. First the stock market, then the housing market, then the gold market bubbled and burst -- taking the savings of the unwary with them. Americans in their 60s have reason to worry about the stability of Social Security and Medicare. New claims on government assistance -- unemployment insurance, health care spending on under-65s -- can be seen as drains on resources that would otherwise flow to the over-65s. The question famously associated with Fox News' Bill O'Reilly, ""Who's looking out for you?"" resonates especially powerfully in the ears of the economically anxious elderly in a rapidly changing country. Gabriel Sherman tells eyebrow-raising stories about Roger Ailes. Always a man who kept enemies' lists, Ailes has -- in Sherman's account -- succumbed to increasing apprehension as he has gained increasing power. His office is secured with a double set of locked and coded doors. His country home features a panic room. Former employees report being followed and suspect their e-mail has been read. The anxiety that permeates Fox News' broadcasts emanates authentically from the man at the top. Yet it speaks also to something pervasive in Fox's audience too. Like talk radio before it, but even more intensely, Fox offered information programmed not as a stream of randomly connected facts, but as a means of self-definition and a refuge from a hostile external reality. Fox is a news medium that functions as a social medium. How this new kind of TV news was built, and at what price, is the story painstakingly narrated by Gabriel Sherman in his indispensable book. What to think of this new kind of information entity is up to you. He only reports. You'll have to decide. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: Fox's Roger Ailes created an information community for a specific demographic .

"(Tribune Media Services) -- I remember a bleak time in Poland when the economy was so maddeningly out of touch with the needs of its people that anyone lucky enough to own a car would remove their windshield wipers at night and take them inside. In their command economy -- oblivious to the laws of supply and demand -- some official forgot to order wipers and consequently, they weren't for sale anywhere. Inspired by a hungry black market, thieves would work late into the night snapping them up. Krakow's main square is pleasant day or night. Many Americans remember Poland as bleak and rundown -- full of rusting factories and smoggy cities. I remember a time when the air was so polluted it turned my hanky black the day I entered the country. Glum locals used to stand patiently in line at a soda stand to sip a drink from the same tin cup tethered to the stand by a rusty chain. Of course, those days are long gone now and many American visitors are stunned speechless when they step into Krakow's vibrant main square, Gdansk's lively streets, or Warsaw's colorful Old Town. While a new affluence has arrived, visitors can still see a variety of Polands: Lively and cosmopolitan urban centers; breathtaking medieval cities showing off a dynamic history; grimy industrial zones still cleaning up the mess left by the Soviets; and hundreds of traditional farm villages in the countryside. As I'm more nostalgic for the humble old days than most locals, I'm sure to venture into the countryside. City dwellers often talk about the ""simple people"" of Poland -- those descended from generations of farmers, working the same plots for centuries and living an uncomplicated, traditional lifestyle. Spending time with this large contingent of old-fashioned, down-to-earth folks can be a great way to get a true sense of Poland's story. Sometimes my nostalgia for the old times confounds my Polish hosts. In Krakow, my friend, Kasia, wanted to treat me to a fine dinner and asked where I'd like to eat. I said a ""milk bar."" Kasia said her mother would never forgive her if I took her American friend to one of these bleak government-subsidized workers' diners. I begged, promising I'd never tell, and Kasia agreed. For me, eating at a ""bar mleczny"" -- or ""milk bar"" -- is an essential Polish sightseeing experience. These super-cheap cafeterias, which you'll see all over the country, are a dirt-cheap way to get a meal, and, with the right attitude, a fun cultural adventure. In the communist era, the government subsidized the food at milk bars. The idea: to allow lowly workers to afford a meal out. The tradition continues, and today Poland still foots the bill for most of your milk-bar meal. Prices remain astoundingly low -- my bill usually comes to about $3 -- and, while communist-era fare was less than lively, today's milk-bar cuisine is tastier. Milk bars offer many of Poland's traditional favorites. Common items are delicious soups, a variety of cabbage-based salads, fried pork chops, pierogi (ravioli with various fillings), and pancakes. At the milk bar, you'll often see glasses of watery juice and -- of course -- milk, but most milk bars also stock bottles of water and Coke. Try a Polish pastry, especially the classic paczki, a glazed jelly doughnut typically filled with a wild-rose jam. At milk bars, the service is aimed at locals. You're unlikely to find an English menu. If the milk-bar lady asks you any questions, you have three options: nod stupidly until she just gives you something; repeat one of the things she just said (assuming she's asked you to choose between two options, such as meat or cheese in your pierogi); or hope that a kindly English-speaking person in line will leap to your rescue. If nothing else, ordering at a milk bar is a fiesta of gestures. Smiling seems to slightly extend the patience of milk-bar staffers. Every milk bar is a little different, but here's the general procedure: Head to the counter, wait to be acknowledged, and point to what you want. Two handy words are ""to"" (sounds like ""toe"" and means ""that"") and ""i"" (pronounced ""ee"" and means ""and""). My milk-bar dialogue usually goes like this: Milk Bar lady says ""Prosze?"" (Can I help you, please?). I say ""to"" (while pointing)... ""i to"" (pointing again) ... ""i to"" (pointing once more). It means, ""That ... and that ... and that."" It's not pretty, but it gets the job done. Chowing down with the locals you'll marvel at how you can still eat lunch for $3 while experiencing a little bit of nostalgia from Poland's communist days.

"Madrid (CNN) -- A wealthy mayor from Lebanon has been arrested in Spain for allegedly offering to pay $55,000 to poor people to obtain liver tissue for his liver transplant, police and a government official announced Wednesday. It's the first time that potential human organ trafficking, a worrisome international crime, has been detected in Spain, authorities said. The mayor, a 61-year-old man, was arrested on January 30 at Manises Airport in Valencia. He has since appeared before a judge, who filed preliminary charges for alleged organ trafficking and released him on condition that he surrender his passport and remain in Spain, police and the official said at a Madrid news conference. Authorities, including Spain's director general of national police, would not name the mayor because of an ongoing court investigation. Nor would they release the names of his alleged accomplices -- three Lebanese and a Palestinian who also were arrested in Spain. ""The police have helped to fight one of the scars of the 21st century, which is organ trafficking,"" Rafael Matesanz, director of the government's National Transplants Organization, said at the news conference. ""It's the first case that we have detected in Spain, of some people who come from foreign countries and who try to get some poor people, some immigrants,"" to sell a piece of their liver for a transplant, Matesanz said. The mayor's alleged accomplices recruited and later paid for nine poor people -- eight immigrants and a Spaniard -- to have specialized liver compatibility tests at a clinic in Valencia last summer, police say. The combined tests cost $16,000, which the mayor's aides allegedly paid. Some of the nine people also received small sums of money for taking part, police said. Just one man, a Romanian immigrant, met the medical criteria for the liver tissue removal and, posing as a legitimate donor, he accompanied the Lebanese mayor last summer to a Barcelona clinic that specializes in liver transplants. But medical workers there, following strict protocols against human organ trafficking, prevented it. Spain is considered a world leader in legal organ transplants, and under its rules, human donors must do so only for altruistic reasons and must be family members or close friends of the recipient. The hospital quickly discovered that the Romanian immigrant and the Lebanese mayor had no such relationship, authorities said. The mayor eventually got his liver transplant in Barcelona, using tissue donated by his son, who had earlier been turned down as a donor in Lebanon, Spanish authorities said. But in Valencia, police were already investigating a tip from a nongovernmental organization that works with immigrants, which reported that an Algerian woman had complained that people were offering her money for part of her liver. The Algerian woman was among the nine people who eventually took the liver compatibility tests. Further investigation into the people who were recruiting and paying for those tests led police to the Lebanese mayor, and to the Lebanese suspects and the Palestinian, who live in Spain, authorities said. The mayor's arrest occurred when he flew back to Spain for a medical checkup. The suspects could face 12 years in prison if convicted, but the court's investigation is still preliminary, with no indictments, which are a necessary step before any trial can be held. ""The main message is that no country is totally free of this problem, so that everybody should be alert,"" Matesanz said. ""Organ trafficking is more or less like slaves of some centuries ago. It's the way some people really control other people. It's exploitation of human beings.""","He offered $55,000 to poor people for liver tissue, police and a government official say .

"(CNN) -- In a sport famous for its all-consuming rivalries, and mirroring a historical conflict that has caused sporting enmity for decades, the figure skating matchup between Mao Asada of Japan and South Korea's Kim Yu-Na is one of the most storied competitions in the sport's history. Sochi will likely host the final chapter in this legendary head-to-head, which has dominated figure skating since both skaters were juniors. Both Asada and Kim plan to retire following this year's Winter Games. It is also the Japanese skater's last chance for Olympic gold. Asada finished up as runner-up to her nemesis the last time they met in Olympic competition, taking the silver while Kim grabbed the top podium spot. Asada, for her part, has won two world championships and the 2013 Grand Prix Final. ""In Vancouver, I had the gold medal as my goal,"" Asada was quoted as saying on the Olympics website. ""I'd worked for it since I was a child, and afterwards I really regretted my mistakes. In Sochi, I'd like to erase those memories by doing everything perfectly. That's what I've been working for these last three years."" Japan and Korea's history, which spanned decades of occupation before entering a post-war state of grudging truce, is the backdrop for the pair's rivalry. The two country's prior conflicts saw Japanese colonial rule enacted on the Korean peninsula from the early part of the 20th Century to the conclusion of the Second World War. Various diplomatic mis-steps since then have kept relations between the two neighbors as chilly as the surface of Sochi's Iceberg Skating Palace. Asada and Kim have been adversaries since their very early days as competitive skaters, and have shared honors throughout their respective careers. They have both been skating competitively since 2005. They were born only 20 days apart, in 1990, and given the length and depth of their on-ice history, it is fitting that they should both choose to bow out of the sport at the same time. Despite -- or perhaps because of -- their long rivalry, they remain very different skaters. The Japanese skater has long been noted for her technical abilities, while her Korean counterpart is praised as a more artistic, emotional skater. Asada was the first woman to land a triple axel in competition and has since bettered the feat. The 23-year-old has credited the ongoing competition with her Korean counterpart as a key motivation for her continued improvements on the ice. They describe their dynamic as friendly, and Kim has also acknowledged the importance of Asada's part in her professional development. ""We have been constantly compared since we were in junior competition so I always considered her a rival,"" Kim told reporters last year. ""While we want to avoid each other, having her there also gave me motivation and stimulation."" As the two prepare to meet one final time, their fans around the world will be glued to their TVs. The Ladies Short Program and Free Skating take place on the 19th and 20th of February. Kim has yet to skate at this Olympics, although Asada arrived in Sochi last week and has already taken to the ice for her part in the Team event, a new introduction to the Games. She fell during her Ladies Short Program routine on Sunday, and finished third with a score of 64.07. Despite the Japanese media saying that she has no problem with her triple axel during practice, it was the difficult jump that undid her at the weekend. It is one of her most devastating weapons but she has had trouble re-mastering it following a change of coach. Teammate Akiko Suzuki replaced her for the free skate portion of the event. Kim is only the third woman to defend her Olympic figure skating title, joining Katarina Witt, who took to the ice in Calgary 26 years ago, and Sonja Henie, who competed in the 1920's and 30's. However, a fairytale ending for for one of the skaters could be thwarted by the aptly-named Gracie Gold, the 18-year-old American who will be skating in her first Games. Gold wowed fans with her victory in the U.S. National Figure Skating Championship last month.","Kim and Asada's long rivalry to end as both set to retire following Sochi .

"(CNN) -- Jon and Marion Setzer knew tragic loss and comforted others who suffered the same. Now friends and family are trying to understand the couple's own tragic end and cope with their personal grief. The elderly Lebanon, Tennessee, couple was killed by a bomb hidden inside a package. Jon Setzer, who carried the package, was killed immediately by the blast. His wife suffered injuries and died Wednesday at Vanderbilt Hospital. He was 74; she was 72. The lone suspect, police say, is the couple's son-in-law, Richard Parker, who was arrested Thursday and is being held on a million-dollar bond. Loss, comfort and dedication were the pillars in the Setzers' lives, those who knew them said. They were church-going, service-oriented people who were not shy to reach out to others in their time of need. When the couple were growing their family, a neighbor's dog killed their 3-year-old son, Jon Setzer's former law partner George Cate Jr. told CNN affiliate WZTV. The incident happened decades ago, but afterward, the couple kept up with news reports and reached out to families that lost children in tragedies. ""If a child was killed anywhere or died in an accident or died of illness, they would immediately go and visit with the parents of that child and share something of what they had gone through with the loss"" of their own son, Cate said. ""They have devoted themselves to helping other people,"" he said. Jon Setzer had a background in journalism and was working for a Methodist publishing house when he met Cate in the Army Reserve, Cate told WZTV. Setzer attended law school at night and eventually joined Cate to form a partnership that lasted for 12 years in Nashville. Marion Setzer was a dental assistant, Cate said. Jon Setzer began his law career focusing on general civil practice but became interested in wills, estates and living trusts, which would become his specialty. Living trusts were a new at the time, and Setzer became known for hosting highly touted seminars where he explained what they were, Cate said. The free seminars were a marketing tool that brought many clients to the law firm. Another CNN affiliate, WTVF, reported that the Setzers moved from Nashville to Lebanon to be closer to their four grandchildren, daughter and the son-in-law who would be charged in their killing. Jon Setzer and his son-in-law were business partners, the affiliate reported. Records show that Parker was the owner of a business called Legacy Restorations, but the documents do not mention Setzer. The contracting business -- whose address is the same as Parker's home address -- has less than five employees and has been in operation for 23 years, records show. After the bombing and Parker's arrest, those who knew the Setzers are struggling for answers. ""They were just sweet people,"" said the Rev. Mike Ripski, pastor at First United Methodist Church in Lebanon. ""Jon I think qualifies for the adjective of 'erudite,' "" Ripski told CNN. ""He was articulate, he was knowledgeable, a wonderful teacher of his Sunday school class."" Jon Setzer had been a lay preacher, and he taught children until his health began deteriorating. Ripski recalls Marion Setzer being at a worship service just this week. ""They're the kind of people that you might describe as being ordinarily extraordinary,"" the pastor said. ""They went about what they did in a quiet way but very effective way."" Ripski also reflected on the loss that the Setzers suffered when their son was killed. ""Instead of their becoming angry or bitter or depressed, that experience -- because they were open to being redeemed by the grace of God -- turned them into the beautiful people that they were, people that so many of us were blessed by,"" he said.","Jon and Marion Setzer were killed by a package bomb .

"(CNN) -- Women must make their voices heard in climate negotiations. The role of women as agents of change in their homes, places of work and communities is often underplayed. Yet their role is critical: Women understand the inter-generational aspects of climate change and sustainable development. We women think in time horizons that span the lives of our children and grandchildren. We need to use this understanding to influence the political process and to inject a much needed sense of urgency into the climate change negotiations. Time is not on our side; report after report has shown this. This is not a trade discussion and we cannot wait until the next meeting or the meeting after that to take action. Time is running out for the planet. 2020 is too late to put a legally binding agreement in place. A legal framework with clear and common rules to which all countries are committed is critically important. It is the only assurance we have that action will be taken to protect the most vulnerable. This COP (U.N. Climate Change Conference in Durban) must agree to initiate negotiations towards this end -- with a view to concluding a new legal instrument by 2015 at the latest. Climate change is a matter of justice. The richest countries caused the problem, but it is the world's poorest who are already suffering from its effects. The international community must commit to righting that wrong. More: In austere times, world needs a climate change 'Plan B' For me, a high point of the Durban Conference was that it demonstrated once again the value of women's leadership in global efforts to deal with climate change. The outgoing COP President who did an excellent job in Cancun last year is a woman, Minister Patricia Espinosa. The COP President at Durban is a woman, Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane from South Africa and the Executive Secretary of the Convention is also a woman, Ms Christiana Figueres. Collectively these and other women leaders are playing a vital role in highlighting the gender dimensions of climate change. Awareness of the differential impacts of climate change on men and women is increasing. We know that in continents like Africa, where women are responsible for 60-80% of food production, unpredictable growing seasons and increased incidence of droughts and floods place women, their families and their livelihoods at risk. All over the world women are adapting to these changes, showing incredible resilience in the face of crop failures, water shortages and increases in environment-related diseases such as malaria. They are growing different crops, planting trees, harvesting rainwater and growing fodder for livestock to minimize the impacts of climate change. We need to continue to support women to be innovative, creative and resilient in a climate-constrained world as we strive to ensure equitable solutions to the climate problem. Investing in climate smart agriculture and capacity building for vulnerable rural communities will not be sustainable without the inclusion of women in the decision-making process. But we also need to see the value of women as drivers of economic growth -- as educators, carers, farmers, entrepreneurs and above all, as leaders. A recent World Bank report found that ""women now represent 40% of the global labor force, 43% of the world's agricultural labor force, and more than half the world's university students. Productivity will be raised if their skills and talents are used more fully."" The report also found that eliminating the barriers that discriminate against women could increase labor productivity by as much as 25% in some countries. Clearly we need to harness the contribution of women if we want to find our way out of the current economic recession and if we want to embrace inclusive, sustainable green growth. Last month, in remarks made at the International Forum on Women and Sustainable Development in Beijing, Sha Zuhang, Secretary General of the 2012 U.N. Commission on Sustainable Development, said ""in many countries women are the champions of the green economy, practicing sustainable agriculture, nurturing our natural resources, and promoting renewable energy."" More: Carbon footprint of the world's biggest cities . Around the world women are showing leadership and championing change, often due to more progressive policies and a greater social inclusion. Their voice and leadership on climate change can result in a low-carbon revolution for the 21st century that is sustainable and equitable. We can have a future where economic growth is not proportional to greenhouse gas emissions and where, for example, off-grid energy solutions could enable the 1.3 billion people without access to electricity to reach their full potential by providing access to affordable and sustainable energy technologies. At present burning kerosene for light and cooking over open fires damages women's health and limits their ability to engage in other work or education because they spend hours collecting wood. It also costs them a lot of money -- up to 20% of their weekly expenditure. Solar panels, improved cooking stoves and LED lights can transform lives, create jobs and contribute to our collective low-carbon future and are clear examples how intelligent climate change policies do not lead to a gray and dull existence but the opposite: They lead to a brighter future. I encourage all leaders to highlight the importance of gender throughout COP17 and at Rio+20 next year. We need to secure stronger references to the gender dimensions of climate change in the texts, institutions and mechanisms agreed by Parties to the Convention. Leaders informed by the experiences of grassroots women from around the world can and must make a difference. I call on women to speak out and lead the way. We cannot wait, we have to act. Our children's and grandchildren's future is at stake. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mary Robinson.","Mary Robinson served as President of Ireland from 1990-1997 .

"(CNN) -- As negotiations with Iran are about to resume in Vienna, some of President Obama's friends, not to mention his enemies, are appalled by the very idea of what they consider a deal with the devil. One congressman called November's interim agreement a betrayal ""worse than Munich"" before he had even seen it. Incapable of joining forces on anything else, some Democrats, Republicans and Iranian hardliners refuse to give peace a chance. A century and a half ago, a recalcitrant alliance of the same improbable ilk caused literally fatal consequences. On February 5, 1865, Abraham Lincoln designed a simple compromise to end the Civil War. It would have saved thousands of lives, abolished slavery and enticed the departed states to disarm and return voluntarily in exchange for fair concessions. It never made it out of the White House. The purists in his Cabinet rejected it, and the moderates would not cross them. A few days earlier, Lincoln and his secretary of state, William Seward, a liberal former senator and a defeated candidate for president, had welcomed a rebel peace delegation to the presidential steamboat River Queen, the Air Force One of her day . The very news that they were talking produced howls of pain in both camps, inflamed as they were by the loss of 600,000 dead. In much of the Southern press, negotiation itself was attacked as a Yankee trick. On Capitol Hill in Washington, Republicans bright with rage denounced any deal with slave-drivers. ""Break up this nest of vipers,"" an Ohio senator said. Honorable men do not haggle with snakes. As the New York Times soon declared, there was ""no immediate danger of peace."" Lincoln and Seward and the three Southern envoys, friends in ""the old concern,"" reminisced on the River Queen over refreshments and cigars. Fragrant smoke filled the air, tinged with the scent of nostalgia. Better times were recalled, to the ring of familiar laughter. Then the laughter came to an end. Lincoln demanded peace and wielded the sanctions of war. The rebels must drop their arms before he would come to the table. Once they embraced reunion, accommodations might be made, including compensation for abandoning slavery, which Northern traders had conceived and Northern lawmakers had condoned, but the power of the purse was not his, and he would not negotiate with armed antagonists. The President was offering them nothing, one of the Southerners said. For the war to end peacefully, the rebels must be ""treated with,"" as Charles I had done in the English Civil War. Lincoln's reply moved the parties no closer to the middle. ""Upon questions of history I must refer you to Seward, for he is posted in such things, and I don't pretend to be bright. My only distinct recollection of the case is that Charles lost his head."" Another Southerner said an agreement would be more durable than a solution imposed by war. Lincoln and Seward were unmoved. They would have no conversation with armed interlocutors. On the long trip back to Washington, Lincoln thought hard on what the Southerners had said. Then he worked on something he could give and assembled his Cabinet that night. For reasons lost to history, Seward was not there. Lincoln read aloud a draft proclamation asking Congress to endorse a compromise. If the seceded states returned and ratified a constitutional amendment banning slavery, the government would pay them $400 million for their slaves, restore their forfeited property and pardon their ""political offenses."" As the President read his draft, Secretary of the Interior John Usher was thinking, he later recalled, of a Lincoln loyalist who had just been heard to say that Seward should be jailed for suborning the sin of compromise. If Lincoln brought his plan to Congress, his own supporters would turn on him. Usher thought he would pay the price if a single member of his Cabinet supported him. Not a single member did. The discussion didn't last 10 minutes. With a sadness familiar to Usher, Lincoln ""brought a long sigh"" and folded up his plan. ""You are all against me,"" he said. Congress was never told that the subject had even been raised. In the dozen weeks that followed, before Robert E. Lee and Joseph E. Johnston surrendered their armies in April, thousands of young Americans died and thousands more were maimed. The South was subdued by the sword and subjected to military rule. A century of bitterness followed. Militants were at ease in Richmond and Washington alike. As late as 1957, a Southern historian applauded the Confederate Congress for going down with flags flying, ""without having begged for mercy,"" despising the few ""whipped senators"" who had tried to bargain for peace when the South could no longer wage war. Short-sighted militants are no less intransigent today. The many differences between the failed negotiations to end the Civil War in 1865 and the potentially fatal outcry over the negotiations to avoid a war with Iran in 2014 do not obscure the similarities. What one Southern participant in the Hampton Roads Peace Conference described as ""a superstitious dread"" of negotiation itself was permitted to prevail in 1865, with historically tragic results. At the bargaining table in Vienna, the Obama administration is taking a longer view. A century and a half from now, posterity will thank them for it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Conroy.","James Conroy: Lincoln's peace efforts worth recalling as Obama tries negotiating with Iran .
He says hardliners on both sides of the war scuttled Lincoln's peace plan .
Conroy says the Civil War could have ended months earlier, saving thousands of lives .

Andrew Cuomo, took the stand Wednesday in a DWI trial stemming from a 2012 traffic accident and repeated her claim that she mistakenly took a sleeping pill the morning of the crash. She said that she never felt the effects of the powerful sleep aid in her system. Kennedy is facing a misdemeanor charge of driving while intoxicated for allegedly swerving between lanes and careening into a tractor-trailer on a Westchester County, New York, interstate in July 2012. She drove away from the accident scene despite a shredded tire, and was found collapsed over the steering wheel of her Lexus SUV a short time later, according to testimony. Kennedy has said she swallowed a pill she believed to be her thyroid medication at around 7:30 the morning of the incident, but that she may have mixed up medicine bottles and taken zolpidem, a powerful sleep aid, instead. A blood test confirmed the presence of zolpidem in Kennedy's system, according to trial testimony this week. ""I now know thanks to the tox lab that I must have taken the sleeping medication by mistake,"" said Kennedy, looking at the jury as she testified. Kennedy said she made cappuccino, had some carrots, prepared bags for the gym and office and had no problem leaving her apartment and getting to her vehicle the morning of the accident. Her memory from that morning ends just before she entered the highway, Kennedy said. The next thing she recalls is a knock on the window of her SUV, and a man she thought was a police officer asking if she was OK. ""I was confused by that because I thought I was fine,"" she said on the stand. During a contentious cross examination, Kennedy insisted that she would not have stayed behind the wheel if she'd felt the effects of the medication. ""If I'd realized I was impaired, I would have pulled over,"" she told prosecutor Doreen Lloyd, and also said she doesn't know what the side effects of zolpidem might feel like. ""You've taken this pill for 10 years and you can't tell me whether or not it makes you feel tired after you take it?"" Lloyd asked. ""I guess I don't really think about how I'm feeling when I take it,"" Kennedy replied. ""I take it, and then I'm asleep."" The jury has heard testimony from 15 witnesses in the case, and could begin its deliberations Thursday. Defense attorney William Aronwald told CNN Wednesday afternoon that a forensic pharmacologist was the only remaining defense witness. Sitting in court was Kennedy's mother, Ethel Kennedy, and younger sister Rory, who was a defense witness. Kennedy said she used zolpidem for travel across time zones but had never taken it in the morning. She testified that she normally kept the 10 mg pills in a sealed plastic bag in the medicine cabinet, away from her thyroid medication, but on July 13, 2012, she had both medications on the vanity because she was packing for a trip. The night before the accident, Kennedy said on the stand, she'd been to a cocktail party but did not drink because she was driving home. Kennedy opened her testimony speaking about her family background, saying that she was raised by her mother after her father died when she was 8 years old. ""He was killed when he was running for president,"" she said. Under direct examination by her lawyer, Gerald Lefcourt, Kennedy described her human rights work and her healthy lifestyle, saying she visited the gym often and kept an organic garden. At the start of her defense case Tuesday, Kennedy watched with a smile as Rory Kennedy described their close relationship. ""She's really my best friend,"" Rory Kennedy on the stand. When asked about her sister's reputation for truthfulness, she said, ""She wrote the book called 'Speak Truth to Power' about her commitment to justice and truth, and that's what she has devoted her life to."" Trial opens with video of sobriety tests, claim of 'sleep driving' A growing group of supporters has sat in the rows behind the defendant throughout the two trial days, including sister Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, brothers Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Douglas Kennedy, and their mother, who is 85. Jurors heard from Bradley Molloy, a drug-detection specialist with New York State Police who evaluated Kennedy after the crash. Some three hours after she allegedly failed three roadside sobriety tests, Kennedy passed those same tests with flying colors, testified Molloy. Finding no signs of intoxication, Molloy instead began to suspect that Kennedy's car accident and disoriented state had been the result of a medical condition, he said. Kennedy herself was also worried, and asked for a vial of the blood drawn from her at Northern Westchester Hospital, said Molloy: ""She was concerned and she wanted to know what happened to her."" Kennedy remained at the hospital overnight for observation. During opening statements Monday, Assistant District Attorney Stefanie DeNise said that even if Kennedy, 54, had taken the sleep aid unintentionally, she had a responsibility to pull her vehicle off the road safely when she began to feel its effects. Lefcourt disputed that argument, saying Kennedy had no time to react. ""The zolpidem kicks in, it shuts her down, she's in a state of 'sleep driving,'"" he said. Tuesday, jurors watched another member of Kennedy's defense team spar with an expert witness about the effects of the drug. Laboratory director Elizabeth Pratt conceded that zolpidem is ""a very potent, fast-acting hypnotic,"" that begins to hamper cognitive ability and motor skills within 15-45 minutes. Its effect on Kennedy would have peaked at around 9 a.m., testified Pratt, roughly the time Kennedy failed an initial round of sobriety tests by police after a motorist called 911. Pratt was asked by prosecutor Lloyd whether zolpidem is a ""knock-out pill,"" and replied that the drug would need time to enter the blood stream and brain before it takes full effect. ""And, prior to the time the drug takes effect, does a person still have brain function? Do they still have decision-making ability?"" asked Lloyd. ""Yes,"" replied Pratt. If convicted, Kennedy could face up to one year in prison.","NEW: ""If I'd realized I was impaired, I would have pulled over,"" she tells prosecutor .

"(CNN) -- Earlier this year, the world learned that Oscar Pistorius, a white South African Olympian, was so filled with a ""sense of terror"" at the prospect of an intruder in his bathroom on Valentine's Day eve that he, in a panic, blasted four gunshots through the door before realizing that he had killed his model girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp. Her death is being framed in some circles as a tragic consequence of the fear wealthy South Africans live with in regard to the country's crime, where midnight sounds in bathrooms have them scrambling for bedside weapons, shooting first and asking questions later. I am not in the position to say whether or not Pistorius's version of events is true. This is for the courts to decide. But as an American who has been in the country for 20 years and lived in Johannesburg and Cape Town, I can speak about the unique mindset that comes from living behind high walls, particularly the kind of high walls Pistorius lived behind in his Pretoria security complex. That mindset is hardly one of hair trigger fear. In fact, it's exactly the opposite. Walled complexes are very popular across South Africa, where most of the middle class and all of the rich live behind walls anyway. The walls serve a greater purpose than deterring criminals. They also provide a barrier between the affluent and beggars, junk collectors, basket sellers, fishmongers and job seekers that trawl up and down the streets daily ringing bells and knocking on doors looking for handouts, some on foot and some on horse cart. Not everyone surprised at Oscar Pistorius' fall from grace . But the South African security complex like the one Pistorius owned offers the resident walls within walls. I lived in a complex like this in Cape Town for four years, where I sat on the body corporate, and learned firsthand the weird paradoxes of living within a maze of concrete. The main problem we faced was the overtly casual way in which residents treated security once they were in the bosom of the compound. My neighbors, like people in similar complexes in Johannesburg and indeed Pretoria, routinely left ground floor windows and doors to their residences wide open. One outgrowth of this kind of carelessness was the rise of opportunistic thieves who especially targeted security complexes because they know people living there were, ironically, so utterly unconscious of security once they were inside the perimeter of the keep. As a result, purses and mobile phones were routinely snatched off kitchen counters. These were ridiculously preventable crimes. Living in a concrete womb seemed to make people believe they could totally ignore the possibility of crime that somehow so captured the imagination of Pistorius that he felt compelled to post his now famous 2012 tweet: ""Nothing like getting home to hear the washing machine on and thinking its an intruder to go into full combat recon mode into the pantry! waa"" Why brutality is ingrained in psyche of South Africa . When I read that, my first thought was ""full combat recon mode""? Pistorius might have been on edge, but we in the body corporate sent out endless nagging e-mails to our far less combat ready complex dwellers urging them to lock their doors, close their windows, and set their alarms at night. We told them to not leave their garage doors open, and not to make copies of the outside pedestrian gate key for the legions of maids and gardeners who descended on the complex every morning. We begged them to lock their front doors when they popped out to the shops and admonished them to please not let just any stranger in who rang the outside buzzer claiming he was working in one of the empty units. Our e-mails went mostly unheeded, and the occasional pilfering continued. It seemed that nobody was even vaguely interested in going ""full combat recon mode."" Why was Pistorius so up for it, I wondered? Then it occurred to me that very few people who are really in ""full combat recon mode"" have the presence of mind to pick up an iPhone and tweet about it. And even add a weird ""waa."" We only had one violent incident at our complex. A woman who lived alone was found dead in her kitchen one morning. She had been strangled. None of her things were taken, and her BMW was untouched. Of course we were communally shocked and then worried about our own safety. A week later the detective assigned to the case dropped by to tell us that she had argued with her boyfriend and he had killed her in a rage. The guy was charged with murder but never went to trial. Turns out he got off on a technicality. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ron Irwin.","Oscar Pistorius was charged with murder after shooting his girlfriend in their home .

"(CNN) -- The questions go to the heart of the issue, presenting scenarios some may find challenging. The Boy Scouts of America, now considering a change in the group's longstanding policy against allowing openly gay members, has sent out a questionnaire that goes beyond a simple yes or no on the subject. Among them: Is it acceptable for a gay scout and a straight scout to share a tent on an overnight camping trip? The survey sent to leaders and parents includes five multiple-choice answers ranging from ""totally acceptable"" to ""totally unacceptable."" Listening phase . In February, the Boy Scouts of America's national executive board postponed a vote on lifting its outright ban on openly homosexual scouts and troop leaders. The decision will be made at the organization's annual meeting in May, where about 1,400 members of the group's national council will take part, the board said. The organization said at the time that it would ""further engage representatives of Scouting's membership and listen to their perspectives and concerns."" Read the survey (pdf) The Boy Scouts said in a statement Tuesday that they're in the ""listening phase"" and are ""reviewing a number of issues and how they will impact the BSA, including youth, chartered organizations, parents, and financial, fundraising, and legal concerns."" The questions . The survey's nine questions directly address those concerns and point to the complexities of the issues involved. Here's one of the questions from the survey: . ""David, a Boy Scout, believes that homosexuality is wrong. His troop is chartered to a church where the doctrine of that faith also teachers that homosexuality is wrong. Steven, an openly gay youth, applies to be a member in the troop and is denied membership. Is it acceptable or unacceptable for this troop to deny Steve membership in their troop?"" Another question asks if a lesbian mom should be allowed to be den leader, if the church it's chartered to has no problem with homosexuality. The issues are challenging for an organization that has many ties to organized religion, many of them conservative. Before the Scouts postponed their vote in February, the executive board was expected to consider a proposal to let local groups set their own policies . Opinion: Ban on gays hurts Scouting . The decision disappointed critics, who had hoped to see the organization end its ban despite a 2000 Supreme Court ruling saying it had the right to keep it. ""Every day that the Boy Scouts of America delay action is another day that discrimination prevails,"" said Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin. ""Now is the time for action. Young Americans, gay and straight, are hurt by the inaction ... The BSA leadership should end this awful policy once and for all, and open the proud tradition of Scouting to all."" Conservative groups and some religious organizations have argued against making any change, saying it would dilute the Boy Scout message of morality and potentially destroy the organization. The Boy Scouts announced in January that the organization would consider changing the policy, a sharp reversal of its previous support for excluding openly gay members and scout leaders. The new policy would allow local leaders to decide ""consistent with each organization's mission, principles or religious beliefs"" whether to open troops they sponsor to openly gay people, the group said in a statement at the time. The proposal comes more than a decade after a Supreme Court ruling that found the organization has the right to keep gays out, but also amid declining participation in the venerable American institution. Membership is down . Membership in Boy Scouts has declined by about a third since 1999. About 2.7 million people now participate in scouting nationwide, with more than 70% of troops affiliated with a church or religious groups. The organization has also endured frequent criticism from gay rights groups and other critics who say the Boy Scouts should not endorse discrimination. Activists hail a watershed moment in gay rights movement . Among more recent controversies, the organization came under fire last year after Jennifer Tyrrell, an Ohio den leader, was dismissed by her local Boy Scout officials for being a lesbian. A poll released in February suggests the public is in favor of lifting the ban. The poll, conducted January 30 to February 4 by Quinnipiac University, found 55% of respondents favored lifting the ban. The school said 33% were opposed. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.3 percentage points. Scouting goes through a rough patch .","Boy Scout leaders will vote on ending a ban on openly gay members in May .

"(CNN) -- Television viewers around the world were treated to the grudge match of the Winter Olympics as the U.S. edged Russia in a thrilling ice hockey pool match in Sochi this month. Even for those not familiar with the rules, the sheer drama of the sporting contest was gripping and it made for compulsive viewing. It's not the only time this year that ice hockey has made for a stunning spectacle and generated huge interest. In North America -- ahead of Sochi's start -- the NHL went on a big marketing blitz, with outdoor matches in massive stadiums previously used for other sports. Some 106,000 hardy souls braved brutal subzero temperatures at the Winter Classic in Michigan on New Year's Day and over 8.2 million watched the telecast. ""We want to give our fans the most remarkable two months in the history of the league,"" NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman announced after the Toronto Maple Leafs beat the Detroit Red Wings 3-2 in the annual showdown. Then, ahead of the NFL's Super Bowl, the Yankees Stadium in New York -- an iconic baseball venue -- was packed out for another clash in the NHL's ""Stadium Series"" to underline the popularity of these events. So, with a growing audience among casual sports fans in its traditional markets and now a global audience watching the best of the best competing for their countries, can ice hockey capitalize on this popularity and go truly global? For now, the NHL is coy about any expansion plans, but a spokesman told CNN: ""We have a long history of playing games in Europe and are working with the Players' Association (NHLPA) to formulate a comprehensive calendar of games and activities in Europe. ""International hockey, and the growth of international hockey, we've always identified as a real opportunity for continued growth of this game. Now might be the most opportune time to seize on it."" From the NHLPA's point of view, it believes there is a real window of opportunity offered by Sochi. ""The Olympics will be a great platform to showcase the players and the sport at this best-on-best tournament,"" its executive director Don Fehr told CNN. ""There is a lot of opportunity to continue to grow our game not only in North America, but internationally as well."" All that points to a revival of the World Cup of Hockey. The successor to the Canada Cup (1976-91) it has not been staged since 2004, when Canada beat Finland in the final. The only other year it was held was 1996, when the U.S triumphed. ""We are working with the NHL to bring back the tournament, while establishing a long-term international hockey calendar,"" Fehr said. Allain Roy, a former Olympic silver medalist for Canada who now acts as an agent for more than 200 players, said he would be in favor of a return of the World Cup because of its traditions. ""That's classic hockey, so to me there's some value in it,"" he told CNN. ""One-offs"" such as a World Cup may well help spread ice hockey's appeal, but can the NHL follow the NFL's lead and stage regular-season games in other countries? Goodell is already openly talking up the possibility of a gridiron franchise in London after the success of taking teams to the British capital. Fehr believes that if the NFL can expand its fan base so aggressively outside of the United States then the NHL should be even better placed. ""Of the four major sports in North America, the NHL is situated best to grow there, as there is great support for hockey already in Europe and we have a lot of international players in our game,"" he said. ""The players feel strongly we need to continue to grow our sport internationally."" Roy, who was a goaltender in the Canadian squad for the 1994 Lillehammer Games, sounds a note of caution. The 44-year-old is concerned that the traveling involved if a European-style division is put in place would place intolerable demands on the game's elite stars. ""I think they would love the idea but in an NHL season you are talking about a sport where there are over 90 games in an eight-and-a-half-month period,"" he said. ""In the NFL it's just one game a week, so it's a bit different."" Roy says occasional regular-season games in cities like London may offer a better way forward to help spread the influence of the sport. He also floats the idea of a preseason tournament involving the top European teams taking on the cream of the NHL. ""The best teams in the world playing in a series, I would have an interest in watching that,"" he said. Whatever the future holds for expansion plans, the NHL is thriving financially off the back of recent commercial deals. Television and broadcast rights in hockey-mad Canada alone for the next 12 years were sold for an eye-watering $5.2 billion. NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daley shares his boss Bettman's optimism over the game's health, citing a ""great season"" last year capped by Chicago Blackhawks' 4-2 win over Boston Bruins in the Stanley Cup Finals. ""On the franchise ownership front we're clearly more stable than any time in my time with the league (he joined in 1996) and concluded a landmark television deal,"" Daley said. The 2013-14 regular season has taken a break from February 9-26 while its best players headed to Russia to represent their countries in the quest for gold. Seven NHL referees and six linesmen also lent their expertise for the 12-team men's tournament and eight-nation women's event, though the Olympics were played under the auspices of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). A slightly wider and longer rink was used in Sochi and the playing regulations also differed slightly from the NHL, but the uninitiated spectator at the venues or on television would have noticed little difference. What they witnessed was the world's top professionals battling for gold, although it's only since the 1998 Nagano Games that the NHL has released its players for the competition. Before each Winter Games there have been reports that the arrangement could come to an end. Some NHL franchises were opposed to allowing star players to compete for fear of midseason injury, but it has been maintained. With over 50 million television viewers in North America alone watching Sidney Crosby give Canada an overtime victory over its neighbors in the 2010 Olympic final, it is difficult to argue a case against participation. Crosby was a hero again with the second goal against Sweden as Canada took gold for the second straight Winter Games in Sochi. But the tournament was notable for the strong performances of European nations, with Sweden handicapped by the loss of three key players in the final, while Finland thrashed the United States in the bronze medal match. In the women's tournament, Canada beat the U.S. in the final, but Switzerland took the bronze. Whether this is enough to prompt the spread of ice hockey into more uncharted territory, only time will tell. Roy, who has played in Japan and China, believes there is ""some potential"" to move into markets in Asia. Closer to home, he also wants the NHL to license more franchises in the U.S. because he has seen for himself the quality and depth of players now available, many of whom are on his books.","NHL took a 17-day break during the Winter Olympics in Sochi .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The woman who stopped a plot by conservative activist James O'Keefe to embarrass a CNN reporter said O'Keefe's latest statement on the matter is ""clearly not true."" In an e-mail to CNN, the former executive director of Project Veritas, Izzy Santa, wrote: ""It's clearly a PR statement for damage control. It's clearly not true but what can you do."" Santa was reacting to O'Keefe's explanation of what he said would have happened on his boat in August after he agreed to meet CNN Investigative Correspondent Abbie Boudreau, who was working on a documentary about young conservative activists. The documentary, ""Right On The Edge,"" which aired this past weekend, revealed that O'Keefe had planned to ""faux seduce"" Boudreau by setting up the boat with hidden cameras and sexual props. The details of his plan were contained in a 13-page ""CNN Caper"" document obtained by the network, which also aired a series of e-mails that O'Keefe had sent to Santa about getting Boudreau on his boat. The meeting with O'Keefe was scheduled at an address in Maryland. The location turned out to be a private home. O'Keefe's boat was docked behind the house. In a two-sentence statement prior to the airing of the documentary, O'Keefe said he did not write the document and that he ""found certain elements highly objectionable and inappropriate, and did not consider them for one minute following it."" In a statement posted Monday on his Project Veritas website, O'Keefe again asserted he did not intend to carry out the plan as specified in the document. ""When the CNN idea was pitched to me, I'll admit that I liked the basic absurdity of meeting Abbie Boudreau on a boat and the idea of counter-seduction satire executed in a tame, humorous, non-threatening manner,"" O'Keefe's statement said. ""After all, as all liberal reporters do, she was trying to 'seduce' (a metaphor) me so she could get more for her story. It would be fun, I thought, to turn the tables in jest. However, I was repulsed by the over-the-top language and symbolism that was suggested in the memo that was sent to me, and never considered that for a moment."" O'Keefe explained in his statement how his version of the ""CNN Caper"" plan would not put Boudreau in a ""threatening situation."" ""She would have had to consent before being filmed and she was not going to be faux 'seduced' unless she wanted to be. If a CNN reporter would be willing to engage in such a folly, it might even be more newsworthy than 'Rick Sanchezs firing. (CNN also has Elliot Spitzer on payroll. He's done more outrageous things than anything I've ever gotten in my in-box)."" The CNN Caper document lists Ben [Wetmore] as the author and James [O'Keefe] as the activist. Wetmore is a fellow activist and one of O'Keefe's mentors. The plan involved getting Boudreau aboard a boat filled with sexually explicit props -- including sex toys, condoms, fuzzy handcuffs and pictures of naked women -- and then recording the session to embarrass Boudreau and CNN. The detailed document even outlined possible ""concerns"" and ""potential problems"" associated with the plan. ""If CNN gets advance warning and you find this out, you should simply cancel the operation, period. ...If she refuses to get on the boat, "" the document states, ""Just leave. You're in a position of strength. Make her come to you. To leave the boat kills the operation."" It also warns against ""running the operation without props and with a dirty boat."" ""In the rush to get this done, the temptation will be to skimp on the details, and that just puts two things at risk: 1) Boudreau's confusion as to whether this is legitimate, ruining her reaction which is key to the operation, and 2) making the video that much less interesting lacking props and proper ambiance."" O'Keefe asked Boudreau to meet him in Maryland to discuss an upcoming video shoot related to her project about young conservatives. According to a phone conversation that O'Keefe taped, he wanted to have a ""face-to-face"" meeting with Boudreau, and said he felt more comfortable if she were to come to the meeting alone. When Boudreau arrived, Santa told her that O'Keefe had prepared an elaborate plan to ""punk"" her. CNN's documentary revealed a series of e-mails, which appear to show O'Keefe's intentions. In one e-mail to a colleague, written several days before Boudreau's scheduled meeting with O'Keefe, he forwarded an audio recording from the phone conversation he taped without Boudreau's knowledge. O'Keefe wrote: ""Getting closer. Audio attached of conversation with Abbie. What do you think of her reaction guys...Ben, you think I could get her on the boat?"" In a different e-mail to Santa, O'Keefe gives her specific instructions to help him prepare for the meeting. ""Please go to fedex and print out pleasure palace graphic on large banner,"" O'Keefe wrote, ""needs to be ready by late tonight -- if possible..."" Those emails contradict O'Keefe's latest statement, in which he says he did not implement plans detailed in the document. ""I do believe that Izzy Santa, who came to Ms. Boudreau with the documents and the story, was simply trying to protect me and the organization from a dangerous and objectionable plan, one sent to me in my personal emails that she assumed, wrongly, and probably due to my own lack of communication to her, that I was going to implement,"" O'Keefe wrote in his statement. ""Nothing in the document was implemented."" In a statement released through CNN, Boudreau said, ""I am not interested in debating James O'Keefe about what his plans were for me on his boat. His statement reinforces what we reported in our documentary."" The other part of the CNN Caper document explained how to trick CNN into reporting a false story about the Tea Party or Sarah Palin. The plan involved U.S. Rep. John Lewis. ""Certain past topics, such as the war or terrorism, seem to be relatively off the radar as it regards to the news interest of the mainstream media,"" the document states. ""Things that are on politics, the GOP, scandal, race issues, are all pertinent and relevant."" ""If we were to offer CNN evidence of racism, playing on these currently relevant issues, and produced enough supporting evidence to prove the claim we make, have them write a story and then prepare our allies to pounce, it could be a good way to undercut their credibility,"" the document reads. It suggested creating false evidence and documents. ""The false video evidence, for one, could be focused on the incident with Congressman John Lewis where he said he was called a n----- by tea party protesters, even though the video evidence disproved his claim...Spoofing video evidence proving Lewis' claim, along with a good story that the tea party had suppressed such evidence, might be enough for CNN to report on the story."" ""The video evidence just needs to be simple, just Lewis walking by with a faint n----- said in the background, yelled by someone there. The video evidence would need to be sufficient to get by potential fact-checkers at CNN who might analyze the video and audio."" The document states that ""the danger is, of course, that the lie becomes the official truth, and so it would be necessary to immediately deconstruct this story on friendly networks and media outlets. The goal isn't to draw out the scandal after all, rather just to embarrass CNN by having them report a false story. So immediately reporting on the falseness of the story would be key."" O'Keefe's statement did not address this part of the ""punk."" ""I can assure my supporters and my misguided adversaries that Project Veritas will continue to work to produce the investigative reports that CNN and others in the mainstream media have failed to deliver. It's time to get back to work. Projects will be released soon. That inbox is getting full again. ""And you never know what bizarre idea I'm going to need to reject next . . ."" O'Keefe concluded.","Santa says O'Keefe's claims that he never considered carrying out the plan are untrue .

"Perugia, Italy (CNN) -- Amanda Knox, the American convicted in December 2009 of the sexual assault and murder of her British roommate in Italy, is ""cautiously optimistic"" as she begins the lengthy appellate process in Perugia, Italy, her best friend Madison Paxton said on Saturday. Two forensic experts from Rome's La Sapienza University were sworn in Saturday by Italian judge Claudio Pratillo Hellman, taking an oath to uphold objectivity as they retest crucial forensic evidence used to convict Knox, 23, and her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, of killing Meredith Kercher in Perugia. The experts' work begins on February 9 and they must conclude their analysis by May 9. Results will be presented to the two-judge and six layperson jury on May 21. Carla Vecchioti and Stefano Conti, both professors of forensic science at La Sapienza University in Rome, will test the validity of the forensic results of two controversial forensic exhibits from Knox's trial. The first is a knife found in Sollecito's apartment with Knox's DNA on the handle and what Perugia prosecutors say is Kercher's DNA in a tiny groove on the blade. The prosecution contends that the knife was used to stab Kercher in the neck and that it had been cleaned and the DNA matter attributed to Kercher consists of flesh, not blood. The sample, however, was so small that forensic scientists investigating Kercher's murder were not able to double test it in accordance with international forensic science norms, which Knox's legal team says raises doubts about its validity. Conti asked the Perugia judge if he and his colleague could disassemble the knife, removing the handle from the blade, to see if there is other forensic evidence that has not been tested. Judge Hellman reserved the right to pass judgement on that decision until a later date, telling Conti that she could petition the court for permission to take the knife apart if necessary. The second piece of evidence the forensic experts will test is the tiny metal clasp from Kercher's bra, which was cut from her body after her murder. Forensic scientists in the investigatory phase determined that Sollecito's DNA is present on the metal clasp. The clasp was . identified on an investigatory video tape on November 2, 2007, when Kercher's body was found. But the clasp was not collected until nearly six weeks later, giving the defense cause to question whether the sample may have been contaminated. Sollecito's DNA was also found on a cigarette butt in the house where Kercher was murdered, but nowhere else. Jude Hellman ruled that testimony from several key witnesses could be heard during the lengthy appellate process. On March 12 and 26, the court will hear testimony from Antonio Curatolo, a homeless man who testified during the criminal trial that he saw Knox and Sollecito near the crime scene the night of the murder. Curatolo, who is also facing trial on separate drug charges, said during the initial criminal trial that the same night he saw Knox and Sollecito he also saw student revelers waiting for shuttle buses headed to Perugia's discotheques. Judge Hellman granted the defense's request to hear testimony from both the bus drivers and disco owners, who will testify . that the discos were closed the night Kercher was murdered because of the religious All Saint's holiday. Hellman has not yet ruled on whether to hear testimony from Rudy Guede, the third man convicted of Kercher's murder. Guede chose a fast-track trial and was convicted in October 28, 2008 and sentenced to 30 years for his part in Kercher's murder. His sentence was reduced to 16 years on appeal in December 2009 and then upheld by Italy's high court of appeal in December 2010. Italy's high court ruled that Guede acted as one of three conspirators in Kercher's murder. Hellman has granted the prosecution the right to have the appellate court consider the high court ruling in Knox's and Sollecito's current appeal. Knox's stepfather Chris Mellas told reporters in Perugia Saturday that Knox is hopeful that the appellate judge will overturn her conviction and send her home. ""She's doing well and is happy it's going her way,"" he told reporters in the courtroom. ""But she is also apprehensive."" The . court is not expected to make a final ruling on the appeal until next summer.","2 forensic experts will retest a knife and bra clasp from Amanda Knox trial for DNA evidence .

"(CNN) -- Nobody looks to Olympic opening ceremonies for historical exactitude. Yet the brutal denialism of the opening spectacle at the 2014 Sochi Games should anger and sadden every viewer -- and Russian viewers most of all. ""The struggle of freedom against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting."" So wrote the great Czech novelist Milan Kundera. In Russia, forgetting has won. These Olympics opened with a pageant of Russian history that excised the crimes of Soviet Communism. No Red Terror. No Gulag. No Ukrainian famine. No Katyn. The Russian state refuses to reckon with the past. After a brief and partial opening in the early 1990s, it has closed its archives to historians. The few memorials erected in the Yeltsin years are already crumbling, untended and disregarded. Surviving victims have received no compensation or recognition. The sorry story of this failure of conscience is well told by David Satter in his aptly titled study, ""It Was a Long Time Ago and It Never Happened Anyway."" Nor does Russian society press its leadership to emulate the example of modern Germany, where Nazi crimes are acknowledged, memorialized and repented. The victims of Soviet communist crimes numbered in the millions, but so too did the perpetrators and accomplices. They and their children do not wish to be confronted with the truth -- and they certainly do not wish to be held to account for it. An apologist for the Russian state might reply: ""What about slavery?"" OK, fair question. American presidents from Abraham Lincoln through George W. Bush to Barack Obama have eloquently denounced and apologized for the crime of slavery. Americans fought a horrific war to arrest and overthrow slavery, and it was the foes of slavery -- including 180,000 former slaves and free black men -- who won the war, and whose institutions continue to this day. The Sochi opening ceremony did not have to address Russian history. The opening ceremonies at Salt Lake City in 2002 and Atlanta in 1996 did not offer an equivalent pageant. But had they done so and omitted slavery, yes, that would have been a scandal. Sochi did worse than omit. It actively glorified the era of Stalinism. What was presented at Sochi was the equivalent of a German historical pageant that suggested the major events of the 1930s and 1940s were the building of the autobahn and the invention of the jet engine. It's shocking, and we should not lose our ability to be shocked by the shocking. Oblivion of the past betrays the future. Because Russia failed to do justice to the old communist apparatus in the 1990s, it opened itself to the recapture of the state by that same apparatus in the 2000s. Gulag officials and secret policemen were not brought to book, and today, former Gulag officials and former secret policemen again control the Russian government -- and now also own much of Russia's wealth. Vladimir Putin has held continuous power since 2000, without ever once facing a fair and open election. The Russian media are less free today than they were 20 years ago. More than 300 journalists have been murdered since 1991, including an American, Paul Klebnikov, the former editor of the Russian edition of Forbes. Regional governments are controlled from the center by presidential appointment. Citizens have little voice in their own affairs. Prosecutions and imprisonment for political dissent have resumed and are accelerating. Those who gained wealth in the Yeltsin years either come to terms with the Putin circle or are expropriated or imprisoned. Standards of living for ordinary Russians remain miserably low. No beginning has been made on cleaning the environmental disasters bequeathed by communism. Old-age pensions are scanty, and health care provision miserable outside the capital. Yet even as the state fails to meet these basic domestic responsibilities, it has resumed the old practice of bullying its smaller neighbors and subverting its bigger ones. The violence in Ukraine divides a public that wants to align with Europe from an authoritarian leadership backed by Moscow. Wherever you find an international bad actor, from Venezuela to Iran, there you find a Russian ally. As authoritarian regimes so often do, Russia has even taken to stigmatizing and persecuting a scapegoat minority: gays and lesbians, whose basic free speech rights have now been defined as a crime against the state. Truth-telling about Russia's history won't suffice to redress these wrongs. But so long as the truth is denied and suppressed, the work of correction cannot begin -- and Russia's future will be polluted, as Russia's present is, by the corpses of Russia's unenumerated, unmourned and unatoned past. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: Olympic organizers chose to make opening ceremony a historical pageant .

"ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- U.S. officials have taken ""very seriously"" a plot to assassinate President Barack Obama involving a Syrian man who was arrested late last week in Turkey, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the matter. President Barack Obama addresses the Turkish parliament on Monday. But the officials strongly cautioned that American presidents are frequent targets of threats that are all watched very carefully, and in this case the alleged plotter did not appear to get anywhere close to Obama during his European tour. The officials also noted that while Obama gets more threats than usual as the first African-American U.S. president, this particular threat did not force any change to his schedule. ""Life goes on,"" said one of the officials familiar with the matter, who suggested the threat may be getting more attention because there has been a heavy international focus on Obama's first overseas trip since taking office. White House officials declined to comment on the matter, citing a policy of not talking about security and threats around the president. U.S. Secret Service officials spoke only briefly about the case. ""We work closely with the host country whenever there is an arrest, which we are doing in this matter,"" Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan said. The plot was first reported by the Saudi Arabian newspaper al-Watan, which revealed that Turkish security services arrested a man of Syrian origins Friday in connection with a plan to kill Obama during his visit to Turkey. Obama was in Strasbourg, France, on Friday for a NATO summit and did not arrive in Turkey for the final leg of his trip until Sunday. The Saudi paper reported the suspect, who was carrying an Al-Jazeera TV press credential in the name of ""M.G.,"" confessed to authorities after his arrest that he and three alleged accomplices plotted to stab Obama with a knife during the Alliance of Civilizations Summit in Istanbul, which Obama attended on Monday evening. The U.S. officials confirmed those allegations, but stressed to CNN that the information provided by the man is still being verified. Al-Jazeera's bureau chief in Ankara, Turkey, Yucef al-Sharif, told the newspaper his news organization knew nothing about the man and suggested he may have obtained a forged press credential. According to U.S. officials, it's unclear whether the man, a permanent resident of Istanbul, had obtained a real press credential. On Sunday, U.S. and international journalists covering Obama's trip did face more extensive searches of their baggage than usual by the U.S. Secret Service before boarding a press charter flight from the Prague, Czech Republic, region to Ankara. The same extensive searches were conducted Monday before a flight from Ankara to Istanbul. But U.S. officials downplayed the possibility the more extensive searches were done out of concern that plotters may have infiltrated the media. Instead, the officials suggested that since Turkish security officials had not necessarily handled such a large crush of media before, U.S. Secret Service officials simply wanted to go the extra mile in their searches. CNN Homeland Security Correspondent Jeanne Meserve contributed to this report.","Turkey resident of Syrian origin arrested Friday, Saudi newspaper reports .

"(CNN) -- Football fans could find themselves sitting in seats made from sugar when Brazil hosts the FIFA World Cup for the first time in 64 years. Brazil has long led the way when it comes to soccer skills, and the country has also shown considerable innovation in developing new technologies. The two worlds may meet in 2014 as one of South America's biggest chemical companies hopes to show the way forward with its eco stadium solutions. ""What we are doing here is showing the world that we have an alternative. You can produce plastics from a renewable source,"" says Fabio Carneiro, Braskem's commercial director for renewable business. Sugarcane is an abundant crop in Brazil, and the firm hopes that it will provide a competitive edge over its renewable energy rivals. As well as biofuel, it is used to make green plastic -- derived from plant sources rather than carbon fossil fuels such as oil. A landmark deal has already been struck with Amsterdam ArenA, the home of Ajax football club, to first install 2,000 such ""sugar seats"" and eventually replace all 54,000 of the existing ones in the Dutch stadium. ""This technology is not really new, it's a technology from the 1970s,"" explains Braskem's corporate marketing director Frank Alcantara. ""We had, at that time, a lack of ethylene. We developed this kind of technology to develop ethylene from ethanol. This new technology that we are using now was developed about six years ago. We started producing on a commercial basis since last year in September."" The plant in Triunfo in the southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul is the first in the world to produce ethylene from ethanol and then create green polyethylene, Alcantara says. At this stage it makes up a small proportion of the company's total output, but -- with 12 stadiums still being built or refurbished -- the World Cup could provide the perfect stage to spur significant expansion. ""We are talking to the people that build the arenas. We want to have the solution in Brazil that we can have sugar seats made from 100% Brazilian sugarcane. It would be very, very nice for everybody,"" Alcantara says. The Amsterdam ArenA group has a partnership with Braskem's parent company Odebrecht and the multinational Petrobras to develop the renovated Fonte Nova stadium in Bahia state for the World Cup. ArenA chief executive Henk Markerink believes the sugar seats could feature at the tournament as Brazil's national team seeks a record-extending sixth title and first since 2002. ""There's a high probability to do so. The ethanol is a real Brazilian product, and the resources are available in Brazil,"" he says. ""This will be a very interesting product for World Cup stadiums. Because it's a Brazilian product I'm sure it'll be supported on the Brazilian side. We hope this product will be pushed as much as possible."" The Dutch group is also working on the new Arena das Dunas venue in the northern city of Natal, which will have an extra year to be completed as it will not be used for the 2013 Confederations Cup event which will also be held in Brazil. While Amsterdam ArenA has the goal of being the world's first carbon-neutral venue by 2015, the Brazilian stadiums did not have the same sustainability aims inbuilt when football's ruling body FIFA awarded the tournament in 2007. ""But we are trying to get as many elements into those stadiums. One of the things is using rain water in a careful way and also using solar energy as much as possible,"" Markerink says. ""The designs for the World Cup stadiums were from 5-6 years ago and we were not involved then. We are trying to retro-fit these things."" He says the Amsterdam ArenA has made big steps to achieving its goals -- changing to recyclable or reusable materials, negotiating deals to use ""waste"" energy from local suppliers and becoming independent in part through solar energy. Talks have begun to purchase two big windmills. ""In a day to day situation we can already provide our own electricity; on match days when we peak in our usage, we have to get energy from the net,"" Markerink says. ""In the day we deliver energy to the net."" The ArenA's model is centered on profitable fulltime operation, meaning the venue is used for concerts and other entertainment events as well as sport. A similar approach is being introduced in Bahia, where the group is showing organizers not just how to build the stadium but also how to run it and sustain it in the long term -- including a deal with the local university to make sure suitable workers will be trained and available. ""One of the concerns always, especially from the government, is that there won't be any white elephants left after the World Cup, that stadiums won't be used anymore,"" Markerink says. ""We are focused very much on a user program so that the stadium in every sense has a place in society. This stadium is in a very interesting city with a lot of music and dance and entertainment and shows."" He says Amsterdam's main challenge now is to reduce patrons' reliance on cars to get to the arena. This means promoting public transport, and therefore cutting carbon dioxide levels. One such tactic is combined tickets incorporating travel, match entry and dining options. But for Braskem, the big obstacle is convincing stadium contractors -- the 12 venues are all being built in private-public partnerships with the government -- that green technology is better than traditional means. ""The most important thing with our product is you can put it straight in the processing machines and you don't need any kind of investment. They don't have to adapt their machinery,"" Carneiro says. Ever-increasing clearance of Amazon rainforest is a big environmental issue in Brazil, but Alcantara says this is not a problem with sugarcane, which can't grow properly in such wet climates. ""We still have a lot of land that we can use much better in the way of producing goods,"" he says. This has been a landmark year for Braskem's green arm, with deals agreed with big corporations such as Proctor and Gamble, Danone, Nestle, Tetra Pak and high-end fashion house Chanel. From 2013 Braskem will also be able to produce green polypropylene, which will increase its range of plastics alternatives. In football terms, that could mean deals to provide goal nets . ""Once the customer decides and says, 'I'm just going to buy renewable material,' we will have the material and we will be able to produce it more,"" Carneiro says. ""We still have to develop a lot of technology. We are doing it, we are investing a lot to develop this kind of material. It is much more important that the customer decides they want to go towards this material."" Alcantara says the company will continue to push the cause of fossil fuel alternatives. ""We announced we were going to make polyethanol in 2007 and we did it. We have a very risk-taking culture at our company, so we just announced it and we did it. Now we are ready to do much more. We can fulfil that -- it is a market need, a real one.""","Brazilian company hopes that its ""sugar seats"" will feature at the 2014 World Cup .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Consumers should be skeptical of health and weight-loss claims of the increasingly popular Brazilian fruit, acai, and the free trial offers that ask for their credit card information, a nonprofit health group said Monday. Companies selling acai fruits are under investigation after numerous consumer complaints. The Center for Science in the Public Interest said companies offering free trials of diet pills made with the acai berries have bilked thousands of consumers using fake celebrity endorsements and blogs to lure customers. Consumers are asked to provide a credit card to pay shipping and handling charges, but begin almost immediately receiving $80 to $90 monthly charges. Thousands of consumers have had trouble stopping those charges once they canceled the free trial offer. Acai (pronounced a-sigh-EE) comes in a number of forms including juice, pulp, powder and capsule. The berry has been touted as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and an antibacterial. The fruit is said to contain Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids, which are essential to human health. Claims of weight loss are unfounded, said the CSPI. ""There's no evidence whatsoever to suggest that acai pills will help shed pounds, flatten tummies, cleanse colon, enhance sexual desire, or perform any of the other commonly advertised functions,"" according to the organization's press release. Acai's popularity has surged on bogus marketing claims, said Jonny Bowden, a certified nutrition specialist and author of several health books. ""Virtually every berry -- blueberry, strawberry, goji, acai -- are anti-inflammatory and high in antioxidants,"" Bowden said.  ""This particular one is exotic. It's found in Brazil. It's been marketed to have more of a magic ingredient. It's been over-hyped and marketed to death. There are claims to curing cancer, curing baldness that is all over the place."" Like most berries, acai has good nutritional qualities, but ""there is not a drop of research"" that supports marketing claims that it prevents weight gain and facial wrinkles, Bowden said. Acai juices sell for as much as $40 per bottle. ""The expensive acai berry is triumph of marketing over science, that's the bottom line,"" Bowden said.  ""It's not useless, but it's not anything that people are claiming it is."" Companies including FWM Laboratories of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and Hollywood, Florida, Advanced Wellness Research of Miami Beach, Florida, and other acai companies are accused of using fake diet blogs to steer consumers to sites plugging the free trials. After a doctor listed acai as a healthy food on the Oprah Winfrey show last year, and a guest on Rachael Ray's cooking show mentioned the fruit, ads popped up directing consumers to sites selling acai weight loss products as if endorsed by the celebrities. Winfrey and Ray have publicly disassociated themselves from those sites. Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal is investigating numerous complaints and said a lawsuit against FWM Laboratories is very likely. According to the Better Business Bureau, FWM Laboratories received an F rating, the BBB's worst. Other acai companies with the BBB''s F rating include Advanced Wellness Research, AcaiBurn, FX Supplements and SFL Nutrition. ""There are no magical berries from the Brazilian rain forest that cure obesity, only painfully real credit card charges and empty weight loss promises,"" Blumenthal said. ""Aggressive acai berry pitches on the Internet entice countless consumers into free trials promising weight loss, energy and detoxification. These claims are based on folklore, traditional remedies and outright fabrications unproved by real scientific evidence."" Keri Gans, dietitian and spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association, recommends that customers turn to fruits and vegetables at their local produce markets. ""If you're going on the Internet to find them and paying shipping fees, you should go to a market and buy local vegetables and fruits,"" she said.  ""It'd be a lot less expensive."" Acai berries could be part of a well-balanced diet of different fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Gans said consumers should be skeptical whenever any one food seems too good to be true and should not rely on one ""miracle food"" to boost health. ""If [people] hope to find answers in one food for longevity, I would say they're mistaken,"" she said.","Companies offering free trials of acai pills accused of bilking consumers .

"(CNN) -- In her new book ""10-10-10,"" Suzy Welch advocates a fast and reasoned approach to decision making by asking readers to think about the impact their decisions will have in 10 minutes, 10 months and 10 years. Suzy Welch, right, developed a decision-making process before marrying former GE CEO Jack Welch. The business writer, whose work appears in BusinessWeek and O: The Oprah Magazine, spoke with CNN about whether her method could have prevented the financial crisis, what Oprah would think of her mistrust of gut reactions and how to avoid becoming a cliché from a Talking Heads song. An excerpted version of that interview is below: . CNN: Could you start off by explaining what 10-10-10 means? Welch: It's a way of infusing intentionality and deliberateness into your decision making so you are living your life instead of your life living you. It impels you to do a values excavation, where you have a very candid conversation about what really matters to you: who you are, who you want to be. Then you take each decision -- each messy decision, each complicated decision; it's not about ""Where do we go to dinner?"" -- and you consider the consequences of your options in the immediate future, 10 minutes, in the foreseeable future -- that's the 10 months -- and then the distant future -- that's the 10 years. CNN: How does that compare with other decision-making methods, say, like, going with your gut reaction or flipping a coin? Welch: Gut's got its moment. There's a story in the book about when gut saved my life. I think gut is no way to live your life. Gut is a not-transparent, relatively inconsistent method for building a life of your own making. Now, the problem with gut is that good decision-makers are made, not born. If you ask a neuroscientist what gut is, [he or she would say] some of our gut reactions are hardwired on the savanna plain at the beginning of humankind. So, paralysis in moments of fear. The sort of selective deafness we have: only listening to people that we like. Not breaking from the group. There are hardwired neurological responses that always the best decision options. So I say, listen to your gut. But do a 10-10-10, and if there's a gap, figure out why.  Watch Suzy Welch talk about decision-making paralysis » . CNN: So if these gut reactions have evolved over time, is this sort of decision-making process then going against what we've evolved to do? Welch: It is a shortcut to wisdom. So, in fact, when you meet somebody who's really, really wise and you ask them how they make decisions, you often hear them describe a form of 10-10-10. It takes a lot of courage to turn to your parents or to turn to your spouse and say, ""Actually, this is not my beautiful life."" I'm just quoting that Talking Heads song, but you can wake up when you're 40 or 35 and say, ""Oh, my God, I lived the last 10 years for someone else."" This is a way to avoid that. CNN: Does this work for everyone? Welch: I've yet to see it not work. I've talked to many, many people now who use it. Here's where it falls apart: It falls apart in the execution of it. Because people will make a great 10-10-10 decision and then not have the courage to live it. CNN: If everyone used 10-10-10, do you think we'd be in the financial crisis we're in? Welch: The reason we're in a financial crisis is because some people did things without integrity. 10-10-10 is so based on having good values. If your values hurt other people for your own financial advancement, a good 10-10-10 decision isn't going to undo that. Had people been playing to their better angels and used 10-10-10 in the financial crisis, yeah, we probably could have avoided some of it. CNN: What's the hardest decision you've ever had to make? Welch: I write about it in the book. It was my divorce ... Just technically speaking, the decision to end a marriage, there's just almost nothing harder. CNN: Are there any decisions you regret? Welch: Oh, I have a billion of them. That's why 10-10-10 came to be, because I was regretting too many decisions. Since I started using 10-10-10, I think that I've gotten my decision making in a great place. I don't want to say that with any kind of hubris, because I make mistakes all the time, because I'm human. I'm all too human, I guess. But, you know, there's no 10-10-10 decision I regret. ... I don't regret the marriage that I ended, because I have four fabulous children because of it, but perhaps I should have ended it earlier. CNN: In the long term, do you think there are bad decisions? Because like with that one, you're saying there are good things that come of it. You learned something. Welch: The great thing about the human condition, OK, is that life goes on. And there are good things that come out of bad. But there are bad decisions that stall you for years. And there are decisions that we make way too late. And if anything what 10-10-10 does is that it expedites good decisions. ... If anything, 10-10-10 encourages us to start living our lives sooner. CNN: You write for O magazine, right? I've heard Oprah talk about gut reactions and trusting yourself. Do you think she would agree with you [on 10-10-10]? Welch: You know, I don't know how she would feel about it. The book says very clearly that gut has its place. Gut is pattern recognition. I'm not going to denigrate gut. Sometimes our gut is our inner voice. And I don't say ""don't listen to it."" What I'm saying is, ""backstop it."" What I'm saying is, ""uncheck it."" What I'm saying is, ""unpick it."" Sometimes gut is great, and sometimes gut is just easy.","Suzy Welch writes about a fast way for people to make smarter decisions .

"(CNN) -- He is Formula One's undisputed No. 1, and next season Sebastian Vettel will have proof of that fact emblazoned on his Red Bull but choosing a number was not so simple for the rest of his rivals on the grid.

Here are six recommendations for how Hawaii could boost its voter turnout rate, taking into account both national and state policies, as well as individual efforts. Have a look and please offer suggestions of your own in the comments section below. (And a special thanks to those of you who sent in ideas on the Change the List Tumblr). 1. Ask five friends to vote (seriously): On a recent trip to Hawaii, I met people who didn't know the presidential election would be in November (It's the 6th, in case that's you). Others don't identify as voters. That can all change if you invite someone to participate. Better, ask five people, or post this on five friends' Facebook walls. It's shocking how far these personal invitations can go. 2. Pressure candidates to debate in public: By far the most eccentric person I met in Hawaii was Kawika Crowley, a self-described homeless candidate for a U.S. House seat. He is seen by many as a joke. His platform, for example, is anti-tax and pro-smoking (in bars, if the owner wants to allow it). No matter how wacky his ideas are, or how unlikely his chances, his opponent, Tulsi Gabbard, a rising star in the Democratic party, should debate him. The Gabbard campaign said no media organizations have approached the Democratic candidate about having a debate with Crowley. ""You can stand on a street corner and have a debate but we haven't seen any media outlets come forward"" requesting one, said spokesman Jim McCoy. It likely is too late for that to happen now, with the election less than two weeks away. But a debate would have been the democratic thing to do -- even if it had to be held on YouTube. 3. Start the move toward online elections: Young people don't vote. That's true nationally. It's especially true in Hawaii, where less than half of the eligible population casts ballots -- and, in 2008, less than a third of young people voted. There's little if any voting culture in the state. That could change if elections came to younger people in the places they hang out: the beach (unlikely), or the Internet. At the very least, voter registration should move online. It's unclear to what degree this would boost turnout, said David Becker, from the Pew Charitable Trusts, but it's more efficient and more accurate. 4. Ease registration laws: Minnesota had the highest voter turnout rate in 2008 -- with nearly 80% of eligible residents casting ballots. That's incredible, but it could be replicated. The state's laws -- particularly one that allows voters to register at their polling place on Election Day -- make it easy to vote. Hawaii should at least consider implementing the same. As Becker pointed out, what works in one state may not work in another. The cultures and weather in these states are clearly different. But it's still worth a try. 5. Encourage civics education in schools: The best way to create a new generation of voters is to educate them about why civics matter -- how their government affects their day-to-day lives and why it's best not to check out of the system. That's some heavy lifting. It's happening at some Hawaii schools. I went to two -- Mililani High School and Punahou, where Barack Obama went to high school -- to see firsthand what a difference a civics-minded education can make. It's stunning. If you talk to kids about politics and voting, they end up creating videos like this one, by Maiya Smith at Punahou, which encourages her friends to vote. It makes all the difference. 6. Eliminate the Electoral College: Can anyone argue the Electoral College makes sense in 2012? It should be abolished, creating a (for once) truly democratic system where each vote is given the same weight in a presidential election. People in Hawaii feel their votes are less important than those in Ohio or Florida -- or any mainland state. By the time they get to the polls, winners of national elections already have been announced. Presidents have been named. Doing away with the Electoral College would ease this disconnect, making Hawaii's votes matter as much as everyone else's.","Hawaii has the lowest voter turnout rate in the country .

"(CNN) -- Former Colombian President Cesar Gaviria on Tuesday strongly criticized the United States' approach to fighting drugs. Cesar Gaviria highlighted the problems Mexico is facing handling its drug problem. ""Just putting all consumers in jail, as the U.S. does, is not a solution,"" he told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. ""You have to reduce consumption."" In a wide ranging interview, Gaviria said the United States now has more people in jail for narco-trafficking or related crimes than there are prisoners in the whole of Europe. ""What you need to do with addicts and people who consume drugs is deal with them as a health problem, an education problem,"" he said. Gaviria and two other former Latin American presidents -- Fernando Cardoso of Brazil and Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico -- are all arguing the war on drugs has failed and it is time to replace current policy with what they call a more humane and efficient approach. Colombia remains the principal source of cocaine for the world, despite $6 billion in U.S. aid for anti-drug campaigns over the past decade.  Watch the interview with Gaviria » . Gaviria said it's time the United States changed its approach. ""The U.S. has to look at its policy, to start to use more of that $4 billion a year that they use, to use more of the resources in the health system, in treatment and taking some people out of jail."" He highlighted the problems Mexico is facing handling its drug problem. Thousands of people have been killed there in drug-related violence in recent years. He said democracy in Mexico is paying a significant price, with major damage to its judicial system, its police, and its army. ""The Mexicans probably in a few years will be able to deal a little better with the problems of security,"" he said. ""But the flow of drugs will keep growing."" He declared, ""We will never be successful unless the U.S. reduces consumption and Europeans do, also.""","Cesar Gavir argues that the war on drugs has failed .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Three of Michael Jackson's brothers claim in a lawsuit filed this week that they've been ""duped"" by a company selling replicas of jackets worn by the pop icon. The endorsement deal was the first involving Michael Jackson's oldest son, Prince, who posed for pictures with his uncles as they autographed the limited-edition jackets. The ""Thriller"" and ""Beat It"" jackets went on sale online last week, but Jackie, Tito and Marlon Jackson filed a lawsuit Tuesday alleging the marketer bounced a check to them for travel expenses. Steeve Bohbot, owner of Connected Internationals Sales, also failed to pay each of the three brothers the $100,000 each for signing the 1,000 leather jackets, the suit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court Tuesday, contends. ""Plaintiffs, tired of chasing Bohbot for the moneys, have no choice but to seek redress from the courts,"" it said. The suit alleges that Bohbot told the Jackson's that the delayed payment was caused by a problem with the jackets' delivery to Amazon.com, but it was not true. The brothers believe the company is insolvent and has not paid other creditors, including Michael Jackson's estate, which authorized the sale, the suit said. Bohbot did not respond to CNN calls for comment. The Jackson brothers, who recently reunited onstage for a series of concerts, gathered at West Hollywood's Bar Marmont on October 29 to sign the jackets. Prince Jackson, who has previously stayed away from commercial endorsements, joined them at the event, but he did not autograph the jackets. Prince Jackson is not involved in the lawsuit since he was not part of the marketing agreement. It was not disclosed how much he was to be paid to attend and pose with the jackets. Connected International Sales ""duped plaintiffs into a scheme to sign 1,000 collectors' jackets,"" the suit said. Michael Jackson debuted the red ""Beat It"" and red and black ""Thriller"" jackets, designed by Marc Laurent, in 1983. The Jackson brothers signed 500 of each jacket, which are still on sale for $2,350.","Jackie, Marlon and Tito Jackson signed 1,000 ""Thriller,"" ""Beat It"" jackets .

"(CNN)  -- Shirley Chisholm, elected in 1968 as the first black woman in the U.S. Congress, once said: ""I've always met more discrimination being a woman than being black."" The U.S. Senate gained one more woman this election in New Hampshire Senator-elect Jeanne Shaheen. Slightly more than three years after Chisholm's death, Barack Obama will be sworn in as president, a huge step forward for African-Americans. But for women, progress this election year was defined by ""creeping and leaping,"" said CNN contributor Hilary Rosen, the Washington editor-at-large for Huffingtonpost.com. Rosen favored Hillary Clinton, but she and other influential women pundits and activists note that Clinton and Gov. Sarah Palin's loss at the polls does not diminish the strides they made for their gender. ""Women are about 54 percent of the vote,"" Rosen said. ""Do we have equal representation? No. Are we closer to it? Yes."" In the House, 10 new congresswomen will join the 64 incumbents who were re-elected, according to Rutgers University's Center for American Women and Politics, bringing the number of women in the 435-seat body to a record 74. The 100-member U.S. Senate gained one woman, Democrat Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, who became the 17th female senator. And several women could be appointed to prominent roles in Obama's administration. Shaheen will be New Hampshire's first female senator. She won in a bitter battle against Republican incumbent John E. Sununu, tying him to the unpopular President Bush. ""It was an extraordinarily hard year for Republicans,"" said Leslie Sanchez, a CNN contributor, Republican strategist and former adviser to President Bush. ""You didn't have to go much further than relying on how unhappy people are with the administration."" North Carolina elected Beverly Perdue, who becomes the state's first woman governor. Perdue is the first pro-choice female governor of a Southern state since the late Ann Richards of Texas, according to Emily's List, which raised $43 million in 2007-2008 to help develop the candidacies of Democratic women. ""This is the state of Jesse Helms!"" said New York Rep. Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat, referring to one of the most polarizing figures in American political history. Helms opposed civil rights and a holiday honoring the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. ""It's always a big deal when a woman is elected to high office, but this was a significant shift,"" Maloney said. Perdue and North Carolina Democrat Kay Hagan, who beat Republican U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole, are strongly pro-Obama and pro-public education. North Carolina Association of Educators mobilized a massive get-out-the-vote campaign for them. Perdue was the subject of a GOP ad that pictured Obama with his arms around her as his former pastor Jeremiah Wright's incendiary sermons play in the background. In the closing days of the campaign, Dole ran an ad that insinuated Hagan was ""godless."" ""Women generally don't react favorably to campaign smears and mudslinging,"" said Kim Gandy, the president of the National Organization for Women. ""We elected the women who talked about issues that we care about -- child care, minimum wage, health care, equal pay."" Both Hagan and Perdue were overwhelmingly favored by women voters, according to exit polls. Perdue headed up a commission that spent money from a settlement with tobacco companies on health care. In the days before the election, Lilly Ledbetter appeared at a Hagan event. A jury awarded Ledbetter $3 million in damages when it found that Goodyear had discriminated against her by giving her smaller raises than male managers. By a 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court threw out that award and said the complaint had been filed too late. Obama supported the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act; McCain said it wasn't necessary. Democrats passed it in the House but Republicans blocked it in the Senate. ""Lilly Ledbetter has come to symbolize so much to women,"" NOW's Gandy said. ""That issue alone will change votes."" Among the women expected to play a key role in the Obama administration is Karen Kornbluh, who served as a policy adviser and was the principal author of the Democrats' party platform. Kornbluh used to direct The Work and Family Program at the New America Foundation, served in the Clinton administration and was an adviser to Sen. John Kerry on the Senate Commerce Committee. She's well-known in D.C. for her essays ""The Mommy Tax"" and ""The Joy of Flex,"" which addressed the needs of the ""juggler family,"" or the household where two parents are working and no one is at home full-time. She argues for federal support for child care and after-school care, and control over flex-time for employees whose long hours usually come at the expense, emotionally and financially, of their families. ""In Washington, she is really considered Obama's brain on so many policies,"" said Steven Clemons, director of the American Strategy Program at the New America Foundation and writer of the Washington Note blog. Read exclusive interview with Kornbluh . ""Her ideas are fresh and applicable to real life, real Americans."" Clemons said. ""She's been quoted all over Washington from Joseph Lieberman to John Edwards since the [presidential] race in '04."" Also, Susan Rice is believed to be under consideration for national security adviser. She is Obama's chief foreign policy adviser, a former assistant secretary of state for African Affairs and protégé of former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Valerie Jarrett has also been mentioned for White House postings and as a possible appointee to fill the Senate seat that Obama will vacate. She is the Obamas' closest friend and has served as a political adviser. ""The consultants will drag you through the mud so Obama was brilliant in putting Valerie in that role,"" Sanchez said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The United States is overhauling Bush-era plans for a missile defense shield in Europe, based partly on the latest analysis of Iran's offensive capabilities, President Obama said Thursday. President Obama on Thursday says the Bush-era missile defense plan will be replaced with a new system. The ""new missile defense architecture in Europe ... will provide capabilities sooner, build on proven systems and offer greater defenses against the threat of missile attack than the... program"" that former President George W. Bush proposed, Obama said. Obama said the change of gears was based on an ""updated intelligence assessment"" about Iran's ability to hit Europe with missiles. The Islamic republic's ""short- and medium-range"" missiles pose the most current threat, he said, and ""this new ballistic missile defense will best address"" that threat. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, speaking from the Pentagon immediately after the president's announcement, denied the United States was ""scrapping"" missile defense. ""This new approach provides a better missile defense capability for our forces in Europe, for our European allies and eventually for our homeland than the program I recommended almost three years ago,"" said Gates, who was defense chief in the last two years of the Bush administration and stayed on when Obama took office.  Watch as Obama says the new approach is suited to threats of 21st century » . The Bush-era proposal called for the U.S. to set up a radar site in the Czech Republic and 10 missile interceptors in Poland to counter the threat of Iran launching long-range missiles at America's allies in Europe.  See how the system would have worked » |  See a map of proposed sites under the Bush-era plan » . American officials from Obama on down insisted Thursday's announcement does not reflect any lesser commitment to European defense. A U.S. delegation held high-level meetings Thursday in Poland and the Czech Republic to discuss the missile defense system. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk told reporters he spoke to Obama and other U.S. officials and received ""certain other signals"" that left him cautiously optimistic about ""Poland's future security and our relationship with the United States."" Czech Prime Minister Jan Fischer issued a statement saying that Obama told him in a Wednesday phone call that the United States would shelve its plans. ""At the NATO summit in April, we adopted a resolution focusing on building a defense system against real, existing threats, i.e. short-range and medium-range missiles,"" Fischer said. ""We expect that the United States will continue cooperating with the Czech Republic on concluding the relevant agreements on our mutual [research and development] and military collaboration, including the financing of specific projects."" Russian President Dmitry Medvedev welcomed Obama's move with a televised statement of his own from Moscow.  Watch how Obama's plan may affect U.S.-Russian ties » . ""We appreciate the responsible approach of the U.S. president,"" Medvedev said, characterizing the new American position as ""putting into practice"" an agreement he made with Obama earlier this year. ""I discussed this issue with the U.S. president during our meetings in London and Moscow. At that time, in our joint statement, we agreed to, and set in stone that Russia and the United States will seek to work together to assess the risks of missile proliferation in the world,"" he said.  Watch CNN's Matthew Chance report on the U.S. missile defense shield »  A top expert at the Council on Foreign Relations backed Obama's decision. ""The system that President George W. Bush proposed ... would have deployed interceptor missiles that had yet to be tested under real-world conditions to defend against long-range missiles that Iran had yet to develop,"" said the council's senior vice president, James Lindsay. ""Meanwhile, the interceptors would have been useless against the short- and medium-range missiles that Iran is rapidly developing,"" he said in a written statement. But the change of gears, while making strategic sense, does present Obama with diplomatic problems, Lindsay said. ""Poles and Czechs worry that his decision signals a softening U.S. commitment to their security. Both countries saw the system as a way to tie themselves more closely to the United States and thereby deter an increasingly belligerent Russia,"" he said. ""Critics will also insist that the Poles and Czechs are right: He axed the Bush program in a foolish and doomed bid to 'reset' relations with Russia,"" he said. ""Here Moscow isn't likely to be of much help to the White House. The Kremlin will claim a diplomatic victory and it won't offer any concessions in return."" Reaction from Poland and the Czech Republic was cautious, with leaders saying they were assured that the United States remained committed to a strong relationship and their security. The council released a report Thursday that said repeated technological failures had put the Bush missile plan behind schedule and likely over budget, as well. Obama's Republican adversaries were quick to accuse him of selling out allies to placate Russia. The ""decision calls into question the security and diplomatic commitments the United States has made to Poland and the Czech Republic,"" said Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the 2008 Republican nominee for president. Obama has been seeking a stronger relationship with Russia and better cooperation from the Kremlin to support tough U.N. economic sanctions against Iran if it continues to pursue its nuclear ambitions. Missile defense has been a sore point in relations between Washington and Moscow, with Russia believing the shield would ultimately erode its strategic nuclear deterrent. But a senior administration official denied a diplomatic motive to scrapping the missile defense program. ""This has nothing to do with Russia,"" he said. ""The notion that we're abandoning missile defense is completely false. It's evolving into a different system."" At the briefing with Gates, the Pentagon's point man on the issue said the new system will have ""hundreds"" of missile interceptors. It also will have mobile radar units, including some in space, ""that can move to wherever the threat actually emanates and wherever we feel we need to defend ourselves,"" said Gen. James Cartwright, deputy chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Cartwright contrasted the new sensor technology with the radar systems envisioned in the old plan, which he called ""basically left over from the Cold War."" The new plan includes three types of missiles to shoot down incoming threats -- Patriot missiles, which defend a single location; SM-3 interceptors, which he said could protect ""a general area like the area from Philadelphia to Washington, D.C.""; and large ground-based interceptors in Alaska and California. Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said that the Missile Defense Agency's budget would remain the same through fiscal year 2015. ""Now that the plan is official, we are working with MDA to review all costs,"" he said. The Government Accountability Office reported in February that the MDA had spent about $56 billion since since 2002 and is budgeted to spend an additional $50 billion through 2013. The European strategy, the MDA said, is budgeted at $4.5 billion. Cartwright did not say how much the new plan would cost compared with the old one. But he pointed out that Patriot and SM-3 missiles are significantly cheaper than the interceptors the Bush proposal relied on. ""You do not want to go after large numbers [of missiles] with the very expensive missiles unless it's absolutely essential,"" he said. He said the fact that the United States sells Patriot and Aegis systems to other countries reduces the cost to Washington. The SM-3 missiles are part of the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense systems. Other countries, he said, are helping to fund the research and development of the systems. The first phase of the system is due to be in place in 2011, with the subsequent phases rolling out around 2015, 2018 and 2020, he said. ""It's a more advanced system, more cost-effective and efficient,"" the senior administration official said before the president and Gates spoke. ""The technology has evolved in a way that allows you to deploy a system that is more effective in countering both short-, medium- and long-range missiles,"" said the official, contrasting the types of missiles that Iran, for example, is believed to have with intercontinental ballistic missiles of the kind feared during the Cold War. The Bush administration had cited the perceived nuclear threat from Iran as one of the key reasons it wanted to install the missile shield in Eastern Europe. But a 60-day review mandated by Congress and ordered by Obama recommended the new approach that was unveiled Thursday. CNN's Suzanne Malveaux and Barbara Starr in Washington, Per Nyberg in London, England, Matthew Chance and Michael Sefanov in Moscow, Russia, and Richard Roth at the United Nations contributed to this report.","NEW: Polish, Czech leaders cautiously optimistic about U.S. commitment .

"(CNN) -- A Ugandan lawmaker has revived a controversial bill that makes engaging in some homosexual acts punishable by death, a rights group said, a proposal that provoked an international outcry three years ago. The anti-homosexuality bill was first proposed in October 2009, prompting threats from some European nations to cut aid to Uganda, which relies on millions of dollars from foreign countries. It was later shelved, with a Ugandan government spokesman saying late last year that the bill was killed because it did not reflect a national consensus. ""It's alarming and disappointing that Uganda's Parliament will once again consider the anti-homosexuality bill,"" said Michelle Kagari, the deputy Africa program director at Amnesty International. ""If passed, it would represent a grave assault on the human rights of all Ugandans, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity."" A Ugandan government spokesman did not respond to CNN requests for comment. The bill is popular among some lawmakers in the nation, and it remains a simmering issue in Parliament. Its progress has been hindered by an international outcry, including condemnation from U.S. President Barack Obama. In addition to proposing the death penalty for certain gay acts, it calls for anyone aware of violations to report them to the authorities or face criminal sanction, according to Human Rights Watch. In 2010, the lawmaker behind it said the bill is necessary in the conservative east African nation. ""This is a piece of legislation that is needed in this country to protect the traditional family here in Africa, and also protect the future of our children,"" said David Bahati, the lawmaker. ""Every single day of my life now I am still pushing that it passes."" In addition to punishing homosexuals, it also proposes years in prison for anyone who counsels or reaches out to homosexuals, a provision that would ensnare rights groups, they said. ""It aims to criminalize the 'promotion' of homosexuality, compels HIV testing in some circumstances, and imposes life sentences for entering into a same-sex marriage,"" Amnesty International said in a statement Tuesday. ""It would also be an offense for a person who is aware of any violations of the bill's wide-ranging provisions not to report them to the authorities within 24 hours."" Homosexuality is illegal in most African countries, where sodomy laws were introduced during colonialism. In Uganda, homosexual acts are punishable by 14 years to life in prison, according to rights activists.","The Anti-Homosexuality Bill is first proposed in October 2009 .

"New York (CNN) -- A Somali pirate who prosecutors say led the attack on a U.S. vessel off the coast of Africa last year pleaded guilty in New York on Tuesday to charges he hijacked the ship and kidnapped the captain. Dressed in a dark grey prison uniform, Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse entered federal court in New York with his head down and his hands behind his back. He pleaded guilty to felony counts of hijacking maritime vessels, kidnapping and hostage taking, for his role in the hijacking of the U.S.-flagged Maersk Alabama in the Indian Ocean on April 8, 2009. Muse faces a maximum sentence of almost 34 years behind bars when he is sentenced on October 19. Prosecutors say Muse acted as the ringleader when he and three other men seized the Maersk Alabama by force about 350 miles off the coast of Somali. Once on board the armed men demanded the ship be stopped, then took a life boat and held the captain of the ship, Richard Phillips, hostage on it. Through an interpreter Muse apologized for his actions and blamed the incident on the Somali government. ""What we did was wrong. I am very sorry for all of this,"" Muse said in a soft voice. ""All of this happened because of the government in Somalia,"" he added. Muse's actual age has been a subject of debate since his arrest last year. His lawyers lost their bid to have the diminutive, baby-faced pirate tried as a minor. On Tuesday he agreed not to challenge the finding that he is not a juvenile and to be tried as an adult. In addition to the Maersk Alabama, Muse was charged with participating in the hijacking of two other vessels in late March and early April of 2009. Muse told the court that he and the three other men agreed to ""capture any ship that came by."" He added that he did not recognize the U.S. flag on the Maersk Alabama. Muse and his cohorts held Philips hostage for four days in the life boat. The USS Bainbridge, a U.S. Navy destroyer, came to the assistance of the vessel, and in radio communications, the pirates threatened to kill Phillips if they were not guaranteed safe passage away from the scene, authorities have said. Four days after the hijacking began, Muse boarded the Bainbridge and demanded safe passage for himself and the others in exchange for Phillips' release, according to a criminal complaint. While he was away from the lifeboat, Navy SEALs shot and killed the three remaining pirates, authorities said. Muse was then taken into custody.","Muse faces maximum sentence of almost 34 years when he is sentenced .

"Aurora, Colorado (CNN) -- Picture the monumental task of counseling strangers affected by a horror worse than they've ever imagined. Now, imagine spending an entire career doing that, year after year. Regularly exposed to the aftermath of deadly attacks and natural disasters, grief counselors face the fury of Mother Nature and the worst of humanity -- while leading the effort to counteract it with the best. Those who sign up for disaster counseling require a demeanor, depth and inner-strength to keep going, experts say. ""Our job is to provide psychological first aid and to help people find their strengths,"" says Margaret Charlton, a psychologist who has been handling calls and walk-ins at a hotline center here in Aurora, Colorado, since Friday's massacre at a midnight showing of the new Batman film ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Remembering the victims . ""In this type of shooting disaster, the unexpectedness of it is a big part of the difficulty for unsettling families, because they want to know why. And we know after we've done this for a while that there often isn't an answer as to why. So you're trying to help people move past that without being able to know,"" she said. The center and its partners spoke with about 200 people within 24 hours of the shootings, and more have been coming in since. Many are locals who knew victims. Some are even relatives. ""One woman lost her daughter who had small children,"" says Holly Cappello, one of the counselors here. ""And she didn't know how to exactly go about talking to the small children about this loss."" So far, the task of these counselors has been first to express sympathies for any loss, says Cappello, ""then try to sort out from them what it is that they need in this moment."" They listen, offer words of support and encouragement, and focus on helping in pragmatic ways to relieve other concerns -- getting families help for planning memorial services or financial support. ""So part of it is education,"" says Cappello. ""And part of it is accessing resources for the person who is grieving."" While every disaster is unique, this one hit ""very, very close to home,"" says Cappello. ""We knew a lot of teenagers who had friends there -- or who were shot,"" she said. And the gunman targeted what most people feel is a safe place. Going to the movies is even something disaster counselors often suggest that families do together as a positive experience, she said. Opinion: Can we feel safe in a crowd anymore? Cappello herself has a 17-year-old daughter, and understands the fears many parents now have when their children are going out. ""You think when you send your child to an event like that, there's a likelihood of it being safe,"" she says. The ability to associate with those needing counseling is helpful, but it also speaks to a professional hazard: vicarious trauma, also called secondary trauma. Counselors can experience their own emotional toll. ""I have a feeling in a few days I will have a story of vicarious trauma,"" says psychologist Kirsten Anderson, who has been coordinating counseling efforts at the disaster response site in Aurora. Just weeks ago she was working with evacuees from wildfires in the state. In 2010 she helped those affected by massive wildfires at Fourmile Canyon in Boulder. Counselors these days are given a lot of training on how to handle the stresses, and how to recognize symptoms of secondary trauma in themselves, Anderson says. ""That's why we check in with people"" who are offering the counseling, to see how they are, she said. And ""a part of our professional duty is preparing ourselves."" The toll it takes on counselors is a big reason there's plenty of attrition in the industry, the psychologists say. And they've had times when they chose not to take part in counseling after certain events, because they knew they weren't up to it. ""I was tired or there were family crises going on that left me without enough reserves,"" Charlton says. 5 tips on talking to kids about scary news . But for all the challenges, the experience -- amid tragedy and devastation -- is incredibly rewarding. ""I think it's important for everyone, not just professionals, to feel like they're contributing, helping the community heal from what has happened,"" says Anderson. ""It's rewarding for everyone."" ""If I was going to be a medical doctor, I'd be an E.R. doctor,"" adds Cappello, who has worked in disaster response for 20 years. ""I like a lot of energy, I think I do well under pressure."" Whatever the perils of the profession, she says, the work is worth it. ""If you have a skill you want to utilize it in a way that helps people. When they're having the worst day of their life and you're there to help them with that, that's a small personal price to pay."" For now, they're focused on helping the community of Aurora move on. The goal for initial disaster counseling is to help people have ""a little less pain at that point,"" says Charlton. ""People have a little more peace, a little more normalcy than before they chatted with us,"" says Anderson. The result can be enormous. About 80% of those who seek this kind of help often have a ""spontaneous recovery,"" Charlton says. That doesn't mean they suddenly feel fine -- it means the counseling can help steer people in a direction away from developing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. They will go through the normal grief process and think about the events for a long time, but then will move on. ""Most people are resilient,"" says Charlton, who has been working in disaster response since 1988 and helped people after the Columbine massacre, as well as evacuees from Hurricane Katrina.

"(CNN) -- Police in Michigan responded Saturday to two shootings near university campuses, including one that left a Michigan State student dead. Dominique James Nolff, 20, of Middleville, Michigan, was pronounced dead Saturday morning of multiple gunshot wounds from Friday night's incident at an off-campus apartment, according to East Lansing police. An unnamed 20-year-old, also attending Michigan State University, was treated at Sparrow Hospital for a single gunshot wound and released. The incident does not appear to have been a random act, police said. Michigan State expressed its condolences and said counseling was available.

"(CNN) -- World governing body FIFA has had just two presidents in 40 years and current incumbent Sepp Blatter has given his strongest indication yet that he wants to extend that record further. The Swiss has been in charge since 1998, when Brazilian Joao Havelange ended his 24-year reign. Prior to being elected unopposed for a fourth term in 2011, Blatter -- who turns 78 next month -- said he would stand down in 2015. Yet an interview with Swiss radio on Friday shows that he has had a change of heart ahead of next year's elections. ""If I have the health -- and currently I am in good health -- I don't see why I should stop the work,"" Blatter told the public station RTS. ""FIFA needs consolidation. Many people say it needs to be continued."" ""I will not shout 'I'm a candidate' but if the member associations ask me, I will not say no."" As with any potential candidate, Blatter -- who started working for FIFA as a Technical Director in 1975 -- needs the support of five national associations to be eligible to stand for election. He has previously spoken of a desire to fulfill his mission, as he looks to secure his legacy. Widely criticized for controversial comments about racism and FIFA's handling of the bidding process to stage both the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, Blatter will point to having taken the tournament to Africa in 2010 and to the Middle East in eight years' time as among his greatest successes. So far, only Blatter's former aide Jerome Champagne has thrown his hat into the ring for the elections in June 2015. The Frenchman, who served as FIFA's deputy Secretary General between 2002 and 2005, announced his candidature in London last month. At the time, he said he was not sure he could beat Blatter should his former boss decide to run but Champagne refused to comment when contacted by CNN on Friday. UEFA president Michel Platini, a former France international, has also been widely tipped to run for office but a man who Blatter described in 2012 as ""ready"" to succeed him has yet to reveal his hand. FIFA followers speculated last October about whether Blatter was set to stand again after he said that both Africa and Asia deserved more representation at the 32-team World Cup. ""It cannot be that the European and South American confederations lay claim to the majority of the berths at the World Cup (18 or 19 teams), because taken together they account for significantly fewer member associations (63) than Africa and Asia (100),"" he wrote. With each of FIFA's 209 member associations holding one vote, such comments were construed by some as a bid to curry favor with two sizable voting blocs. They came in the same month as Jeffrey Webb, the head of the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF), ruled himself out of contention for football's most important job. Blatter, who will be 78 in March, was elected unopposed for a fourth term in 2011 after his rival Mohamed Bin Hammam withdrew his candidacy after being accused of attempting to buy votes -- a charge he was later cleared of. He is only the eighth president in the history of FIFA, an organization that was founded in 1904.","FIFA President Sepp Blatter says he is prepared to bid for a fifth term .

"Cape Town, South Africa (CNN) -- The Western Cape might be South Africa's wine capital -- renowned around the world as the home of some of the country's most famous labels -- but not far from Stellenbosch's fertile vineyards there's another drink brewing up a storm. Inspired by an international boom for local, independent microbreweries, the business of craft beer has also taken off in South Africa recently, as growing numbers of small producers are experimenting with styles and techniques to satisfy a rising thirst for new flavors and novel brews. ""There is a massive demand,"" says Dan Badenhorst, co-founder of Devil's Peak Brewing Company, just one of the several microbreweries to come out of Cape Town in recent times. ""We started off in a garage, from there we bought our own 500-liter system and now we are in this new 1,500-liter system,"" he adds. ""Constantly, our biggest challenge has been keeping up with the demand."" Read this: How Mandela became a brand . Craft beer is traditionally produced by independent breweries on a much smaller scale than the multinationals. In South Africa, a country with a strong beer culture, consumers have traditionally opted for mass-produced beer products. South African Breweries is a subsidiary of SABMiller, the world's second-largest brewer, and accounts for more than 90% of the country's beer market. But the smaller players have also started making a mark. Almost three decades after South Africa's first microbrewery, Cape Town-based Mitchell's Brewery, opened its doors in the early 1980s, estimates suggest that today there more than 50 microbreweries across the country, a figure that's doubled in the last few years. ""On a top level, the big beer companies are supporting craft beer because it helps bring more people to beer,"" says Rob Heyns, founder of League of Beers, an online store offering local and international craft beers to enthusiasts in South Africa . He adds, however, that craft beer still has a long way to go before it can take on the mass beer producers. ""On the ground level, it's always going to be tight competition and as a craft brewer you're never going to be able to win out against one of the big brewers unless you, the consumer, asks specifically for those beers,"" adds Heyns. ""That's the best that way craft beer can win."" Read this: A journey through South Africa's wine region . In order to win consumers' hearts, South Africa's burgeoning beer makers say they often turn to local ingredients to try and achieve unique and distinctive flavors. ""Locality is very important in the craft beer industry,"" explains JC Steyn, head brewer at Devil's Peak Brewing Company. ""You'd go to Cape Town and get the craft beers from Cape Town because they are so close to the brewery and they are so fresh and all those flavors are still very abundant,"" he adds. ""Once beer travels it totally diminishes those characters."" Beer makers have also started using a number of beer festivals and tasting events to raise the profile of their brands and bring their products to a wider audience. Greg Casey, owner of Banana Jam CafÃ© in Western Cape, holds several of such events throughout the year in his restaurant. He says craft beer is a great trend that's about finding something special. ""It's not about volume consumption,"" says Casey. ""It's become about flavor and it's about trying something that's a little more special, like a bottle of wine,"" he adds. Read this: South Africa's first black female winemaker . ""So you are not looking for how much beer can I consume and how much it costs, you are looking for quality over quantity - and people are willing to pay for that."" Beer drinker Gregory Bowden agrees. ""I really prefer craft beer to the standard commercial stuff that you get,"" he says. ""The variety that's available, the different range of flavors that you can get, it's just something that a mass-produced beer I don't think will be able to give,"" he adds. ""You can tell that people put love into it and there's a bit more attention given to the product than with a mass produced."" It's that kind of care that craft beer makers hope will keep consumers coming back for more. ""You've got to be passionate about beer,"" says Badenhorst. ""If you're going into it for the money, you're not doing it for the right reason,"" he adds. ""For us it's always been a passion; it's been wanting to show South Africans what beer is about.""","Better known for its wines, the business of craft beer is taking off in South Africa .

"(CNN) -- This year is the 150th anniversary of one of the greatest and least remembered political media hoaxes in American history, one with startling parallels to 21st century politics and the Internet age. It involved Abraham Lincoln, covert governmental programs for interracial sex, pro-slavery politicians and scheming newspaper editors. On Februrary 17, 1864, a shocking scandal erupted early in Lincoln's re-election campaign: ""proof"" that Lincoln had a secret plan to solve America's ""race problem"" with a campaign of interracial sexual relations that would create a new ""American race."" This was the bombshell that pro-slavery Ohio Rep. Samuel Cox claimed to have uncovered. His evidence was a pamphlet titled ""Miscegenation: A Theory of the Blending of the American White Man and Negro,"" whose anonymous author urged Republicans -- then the abolitionist party -- to openly confess their desire for race mixing by adding it to their official political platform for the upcoming presidential election. Speaking before Congress, Cox brandished letters of support the pamphleteer received from a handful of abolitionist newspaper editors, which Cox claimed proved the pamphlet's ""disgusting theories,"" which ""seem so novel to us, have been a part of the gospel of abolition for years."" Foreshadowing the fictitious ""death panels"" with which today's Republicans recently tried to kill Obama's health care proposals, Cox's conjured apocalyptic visions of a ""department for the hybrids"" empowered to achieve miscegenation's ""practical realization by a bureau,"" indicting the Freedmen's Bureau recently established to aid the formerly enslaved. The ensuing controversy dogged Lincoln for the remainder of the election campaign, and ""miscegenation,"" this new word for race mixing coined by the pamphleteer, was widely adopted in place of ""amalgamation,"" its predecessor. The hot-button issue of race mixing could now no longer be discussed without invoking Lincoln's supposed enthusiasm for this cultural taboo. The president's re-election hopes had been dim enough with the war dragging on with no end in sight, and this new trumped up scandal didn't help matters. Lincoln's political enemies in the North couldn't have been more pleased with the scandal if they'd designed it themselves. In fact, one of them had done just that. The ""Miscegenation"" pamphlet was a forgery, and the entire scandal an artfully managed hoax. It was the work of New Yorker David Goodman Croly, managing editor of The World, the leading Democratic-aligned, pro-slavery newspaper in the North, and George Wakeman, one of his reporters. Croly's first brilliant move was crafting an amalgamation scandal without saying ""amalgamation,"" replacing a word that set abolitionists immediately on guard with the innocuously unfamiliar ""miscegenation."" The word miscegenation's derivation -- from misc- (""mixed"") and genus (""species"") -- awaited only the endorsement of Lincoln's allies to, Croly hoped, ignite the powder keg of Northern racism. Croly shrewdly presented his poison pill as a pamphlet, a favorite format of anti-slavery writers. Pamphlets were essentially the blogs of their day. Made cheap and easy to produce by technological improvements, pamphlets had democratized access to the tools of mass communication, spreading the views of radicals, cranks, hucksters and crusaders. The ruse worked. Once a handful of gullible abolitionists replied to the copies of ""Miscegenation"" that Croly had mailed them, the hoaxer promptly delivered the material to Cox and sat back and watched. Thanks to a news cycle sped-up by new technology -- everything from telegraphs and railroads to shorthand and printing innovations -- the newspaper editor knew the story would be burning itself and the new word that embodied it into the national consciousness before the Lincoln administration knew what was happening. The Emancipation Proclamation, signed the previous year, was dubbed the ""Miscegenation Proclamation,"" and the new word was a staple of political rhetoric throughout the campaign, including cartoons like ""Miscegenation, or the Millennium of Abolitionism,"" which depicted Lincoln and leading Republicans and abolitionists courting black women. Like the claims that President Obama is a secret Muslim -- a Pew poll in 2012 found nearly one out of five Americans believe this -- the miscegenation story proved immune to debunking. Not everyone believed, perhaps not even most, but the story would not die. Eager to keep the story alive, Croly refrained from mentioning miscegenation in his own newspaper for weeks, knowing that any association with The World would bring greater skepticism. He also seems to have spread rumors attributing the pamphlet to this or that abolitionist. Croly went to sometimes comical lengths to keep the miscegenation story alive. A week after Theodore Tilton, one of the abolitionists who inspired the hoax, expressed doubt that the pamphlet's author ""was in earnest,"" Croly wrote to him pretending to be the author. Tilton in turn told his readers that ""the author of 'Miscegenation' has written to assure us of the perfect sincerity in which he presented his views to the public."" Croly and Wakeman even narrowly avoided arrest when their offices were stormed by Federal soldiers searching for a different newspaper hoaxer. When late-summer Union victories suddenly rescued Lincoln's re-election hopes, Croly sent a copy of the pamphlet to Lincoln himself. ""I am aware,"" he wrote to Lincoln, ""that the subject creates prejudice among depraved and ignoble minds, but I am sure that you ... see no other solution of the Negro. .... May I ask your permission to dedicate it to your Excellency?"" Lincoln, rather busy at the time and no fool, never responded. Although the White House kept quiet on the subject, Republican congressmen and abolitionists rebutted the charges. Some thought them fake and some thought they were ""friendly fire"" from a well-meaning anti-slavery crackpot. For the record, Lincoln equivocated on the subject of racially mixed marriage. But he is also recorded as saying: ""If a white man wants to marry a Negro woman, let him do it, if the Negro woman can stand it."" Word that miscegenation had been a hoax got out after Lincoln's re-election, but the hoaxers maintained their anonymity. Their identities only emerged after their deaths, and the story of the Miscegenation Hoax faded into obscurity. The word ""miscegenation,"" however, did not. With its hoax origin forgotten, ""miscegenation's"" scientific connotation -- and the fact that it has the same prefix as ""mistake"" or ""misbegotten"" -- planted the notion that races represented different species that should be separated. When the hopeful progress of the Reconstruction period was ended, thanks to white Southern aggression and Northern white apathy, the ideology of ""anti-miscegenation"" became the foundational justification for the Jim Crow segregation that followed. Under Jim Crow, racial status replaced slave status as the primary basis for the continued oppression and exploitation of African-Americans. State ""anti-miscegenation laws"" barring interracial marriage policed the boundaries of white privilege, and their language is suffused with pseudo-scientific rationales that the word ""miscegenation"" embodied. Behind the anti-miscegenation laws stood the extra-legal threat of lynch law and the Klan. These laws remained on the books in the former Confederate states until declared unconstitutional in 1969's Loving v. Virginia Supreme Court decision, which invalidated laws banning interracial marriage. Inverting Marx's famous formulation, ""miscegenation"" started as farce and ended as tragedy. We would do well to take more seriously the possible dangers of our rather similar political and media culture in which lies and dangerous memes on the Internet are both ephemeral and eternal. It matters what we call things. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Philip Kadish.","Philip Kadish: It's the 150th anniversary of a huge political hoax in United States .

"(CNN) -- ""I felt a massive cold chill through my body and saw my leg completely missing."" That was the moment Joany Badenhort's life changed, and looking back at the gruesome facts it's hard to believe it was for the better. But when the 19-year-old snowboarder lines up at the start gate in the mountains above Sochi, less than a decade later, she will be counting her blessings. ""Through this, I've met the most amazing people and I'd never have been able to dream of the Paralympics without the accident,"" she tells CNN. ""I totally think it's a blessing and, if I got the option to get the leg back, the negative of having one leg as opposed to the positives of this, it would be an easy choice. I'd stick with one leg."" It was a typical sunny South African day when the idyllic world of a 10-year-old girl turned into a nightmare. She'd been playing with her brothers on the family farm, felt thirsty and went to get a drink of water. The outdoor pump appeared to be broken, so she went to see her father, who was with a farm-hand trying to fix another piece of machinery. She arrived just as ""that stupid machine"" was switched back on. It's not the pain she remembers instantly, nor the sheer volume of blood that pumped out of her body, or even her family's remarkably calm reactions. ""I couldn't feel anything, not even the water that my mum gave me to drink. I couldn't feel my fingers or people carrying me back to the house or touching me,"" Badenhorst recalls. ""But after half an hour, it was like my nervous system switched back on. I started crying -- as you can imagine, the pain was beyond anything I'd ever felt."" Her plight, though, was in danger of getting infinitely worse. There was no option of an ambulance or nearby hospital; a rescue helicopter was unable to make it there. Eventually, a mercy flight was commandeered and landed nearby. The plane was so small it could only fit the two medical staff and Badenhorst on board. Her family had to make a five-hour journey by road to Johannesburg, unsure how their only daughter was faring in the skies overhead. ""I didn't go to sleep until I was knocked out on the plane,"" she recalls. ""But just before that I remember one of them saying, 'She's never going to make it with these injuries.' That's a harsh thing for a 10-year-old who's just lost her leg to hear."" That was far from the end of her journey. The family moved to Australia four years after the accident, partly because of a good job offer for her dad, partly to ensure a safer life for the four children, and partly to ensure better medical care and a prosthetic limb for Joany. Badenhorst has not been back home to visit the rest of her family in the intervening five years, and she misses many aspects of life in South Africa. But she has embraced Australian culture -- first taking up athletics before a chance encounter led to her switching to snow sports. Showing off on high heels to ""prove a point"" to her prosthetic specialist, she caught the attention of Peter Higgins -- Australia's Disabled WinterSports snowboarding coach. Higgins, who was aware of her athletics background in the 100 meters, javelin and high jump, spotted something in the teenager that he felt lent itself to Paralympic aspirations. ""He really took a big risk on me but I think it will pay off,"" she says. On Friday Badenhorst will compete in para-snowboard cross as the first woman to represent Australia at the Winter Paralympics. ""When I started, I was rubbish,"" she says. ""I fell over so many times I think I lost a few brain cells. ""But now when you're going fast on good snow, it feels like you're gliding mid-air. You don't really feel the turns. It's the most freeing aspect, and there's nothing else I know that gets close to it. It's like you're flying."" While she is thankful to many people for helping her get to Sochi, one name stands out in her list. Jan Kemp did not know Badenhorst nor her wider family, but was so touched by her plight that he came to visit her every day in hospital. The first time he arrived with a dusty Valentine's Day present to give to her, and was only allowed to visit when cagey hospital staff acquiesced at Badenhorst's insistence. ""It turns out he had a daughter who died in a cycling accident a couple of days before Valentine's Day,"" she explains. ""He and his daughter were both in the same cycling race. He finished but she got hit by a truck and died, and he never got to give the Valentine's Day present to her."" Each week he would return to visit, usually giving her flowers picked from the hospital garden, and the pair remain in contact to this day. It was a long road to recovery for Badenhorst -- it took a year before she could walk again after the accident. ""How could I not have got better with amazing support like that? There was just someone there for me every day,"" she says. ""A lot of people are interested to know what it's like to be leg-less. I was so young, so I don't really remember what it was like to walk with two legs, so I don't miss something I don't really remember."" The fact that she has entertained a snowy sporting career seems remarkable, having grown up in two countries so renowned for their warm climates. ""I never imagined I'd be at the Paralympics.""","Aged 10, Joany Badenhorst's leg was ripped off by machinery while playing at her family's farm .

"New York (CNN) -- Two Mexican brothers have been extradited to the United States to join a third brother to face sex trafficking charges in New York as part of a complex collaborative effort to combat human trafficking, federal officials said Monday. Benito Lopez-Perez, 32, and Anastasio Romero-Perez, 39, were arraigned on a 25-count indictment Monday morning in Brooklyn Federal Court, the U.S. attorney and the Justice Department said in a news release. The extensive indictment is the product of the Bilateral Human Trafficking Enforcement Initiative, an in-depth partnership involving the Department of Justice, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Homeland Security Investigations, the Urban Justice Center and many non-profit and non-governmental organizations in the United States and Mexico, the release said. ""The indictment charges the defendants with sex trafficking, interstate prostitution, alien smuggling and money laundering offenses, involving victims as young as 14 and 15 years old,"" it said. On December 3, the third brother, Jose Gabino Barrientos-Perez, 51, was extradited from Mexico to face the same charges, officials said. U.S. Attorney Loretta E. Lynch also announced the extradition last month of Antonio Lira-Robles on the same charges. All the extraditions resulted from the comprehensive anti-trafficking program, which has so far resulted in the indictment of 52 defendants on sex trafficking charges and has ""rescued over 100 victims, including 17 minors,"" the release said. ""The sex trafficking of young girls and women is modern-day slavery we will do everything in our power to eradicate,"" Lynch said in a news conference Monday. She also announced the reuniting of a victim of sex trafficking with her child after a separation of more than 10 years. The mother was involved with the Carreto family sex trafficking ring, officials said. The ring operated between Mexico and United States from 1991 to 2004, the Justice Department said upon Carreto's sentencing in 2009. United States v. Carreto is considered to be ""one of the first sex trafficking cases prosecuted by the United States Attorney's Office in Brooklyn,"" according to Monday's news release, ""After substantial post-conviction investigation and international coordination, the child was located and reunited with the victim-mother."" Sienna Baskin, co-director of the Sex Workers Project at the Urban Justice Center, called this ""an example of people going above and beyond and being creative and thinking outside the box in order to make this happen. Now we need the lessons we learned in this case to be institutionalized."" Baskin said she and others working as a part of the ad hoc task force realize that the fate of the victims is just as important as the fate of the traffickers. Under the initiative, ""the United States and Mexico have collaborated to bring high-impact prosecutions under both U.S. and Mexican law to more effectively dismantle human trafficking networks operating across the U.S.-Mexico border,"" Monday's news release said. ""The extraditions over the weekend followed by the arraignments today are a testament to our resolve to bring justice to those charged with forcing young women into prostitution,"" James T.

"Rome (CNN) -- An Italian sex scandal that spawned nationwide demonstrations over the premier's alleged abuse of power and paying an underage girl for sex began at a dinner party in Milan with a Moroccan-born dancer nicknamed ""Ruby Heartbreaker."" The dancer, Karima El Mahrough, was 17 years old at the time of the alleged sexual encounter with Italy's Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, according to prosecutors in Milan. The leggy performer, who has since appeared in scantily clad photographs across the country, told the Italian news channel Sky TG24 that she had lied about her age before meeting Berlusconi for a dinner party at his private residence near Milan. ""He knew that I was 24 years old because I told everyone that I was 24 years old,"" she said. ""I didn't want people to know that I was a minor."" It was during that first encounter on Valentine's Day in 2010 that El Mahrough said she received 7,000 euros (about $9,300) after a friend informed Berlusconi that she needed help. Both have denied allegations of having sex. ""Absolutely no,"" El Mahrough said. ""I just arrived in Milan, and it was a little difficult living there,"" she said, claiming that Berlusconi gave her the money to help support herself financially. The friend ""spoke with (Berlusconi) and explained my situation, my story, my family situation,"" she said. ""And he helped me."" But an investigation into their relationship burgeoned after the prime minister urged police to release her when she was arrested on theft charges. El Mahrough said that after the arrest, she was visited by dancer Michelle Oliveira and regional lawmaker Nicole Minetti, whom prosecutors have tried to link to the allegations against the prime minister. El Mahrough said Minetti then called Berlusconi ""to explain how things went,"" handing her the phone ""so that I could thank him."" In their conversation, El Mahrough described the premier as ""bitter"" because ""he had allowed someone to enter his house trustingly."" ""I didn't know about this famous call of the premier to the police,"" El Mahrough told Sky TG24. ""I learned it from the newspapers."" Investigators say they later questioned the dancer's former roommate, who claimed El Mahrough had confided in her, describing the details of her sexual relationship with the Italian premier. Berlusconi, 74, denied allegations surrounding his relationship with El Mahrough as well as his alleged abuses of power, arguing that his phone call to police was a case of mistaken identity. His party has argued that Berlusconi believed El Mahrough was a relative of then-Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and that he called the police station on her behalf to avoid a possible diplomatic crisis with Egypt. But little is known about the dancer whose involvement in the scandal helped catalyze demonstrations against Italy's premier and his penchant for dinner parties attended by ""pretty girls,"" according to local media reports and accounts by lawmaker Minetti. El Mahrough reportedly said on the Italian talk show ""Kalispera"" -- owned by Berlusconi -- that she was a victim of child abuse and became a runaway before landing a job dancing at nightclubs. The scandal has made El Mahrough, now 18, a national figure. Meanwhile, Berlusconi has been ordered to stand trial in April, when he will face a three-judge panel. All of them are women. CNN's Hada Messia contributed to this report.","Berlusconi is accused of having sex with a dancer nicknamed ""Ruby Heartbreaker""

But he didn't always enjoy such success, and he said the U.S. Navy gave him what he needed, when he needed it most. ""I wasn't a bad boy, I was just sort of left to wander around,"" Cosby, who as a young man served as a hospital corpsman, told a Navy-packed auditorium. The iconic comic was in town to be recognized as an honorary chief petty officer in the U.S. Navy. ""I want to welcome you to the ranks of the people that run the Navy, people that make the ships sail on time, the aircraft fly, the hospitals work,"" said Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus, who received the same honor last year. ""Bill Cosby has earned this."" Cosby joined the Navy in 1956 and after graduating from boot camp, went on to become a Navy hospital corpsman. He told the crowd joining the Navy seemed like the best place for him ""to die."" ""I don't want to join the Army because I'll die in a foxhole in dirt...I don't want to be in the Marine Corp because you die before you get out of there,"" Cosby told the laughing crowd filled with Navy personnel. The biggest laugh came when Cosby explained why he joined the Navy. ""I want to be in the Navy, because no matter how you die, you're in the middle of the ocean and it will wash out your underpants and that will make my mother very happy."" Just before Cosby thrilled the crowd with his famous story-telling delivery, he was presented with a Navy uniform, which he put on, and set of Navy anchor pins that were pinned on by Mabus and the most senior enlisted member of the branch, Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy Rick West. Cosby, who was honorably discharged from the Navy in 1960, said the one of the greatest moments in his life was graduating from Navy boot camp. The comedian, known for his clean acts that do not include profanity, struggled at boot camp, saying the vulgar language and yelling weren't for him. It got so bad, he said, that he even wrote his mother a letter asking if she could get him out of camp. Cosby said he was called to the commander's office and told that his mother had written back. ""My mother asked the company commander to please continue to do these things,"" Cosby said, sporting his new Navy uniform. The 73-year-old star recalled that finishing Navy boot camp was the first time his mother saw him graduate from anything. Cosby didn't graduate from high school but later received a high school equivalency. After the Navy, Cosby went on to attend Temple University and he earned a master's degree and a doctorate in education at the University of Massachusetts. Cosby served on the USS Fort Mandan, a Navy support ship that was based at facilities including the Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, where he helped in rehabilitation of wounded Korean War veterans. Cosby said he earned $42 every two weeks in the Navy but the lessons he learned were priceless. ""I was eating for free and, as they say, (having) a place to lay your head was wonderful, lights out, lights on,"" Cosby said, telling his laughing audience that he learned discipline in the Navy, among other things. ""Urinate in one urinal and continue to do so in that same one -- discipline,"" he joked. He then took a swipe at those who have never served. ""I have to tell you I have a problem with civilians...I still know a deck is better buffed by someone in the service, and cheaper."" The Navy crowd laughed again.","Comedian Bill Cosby gets an honorary rank in the Navy .

"(CNN) -- Chelsea captain John Terry has been been hit with a four-match ban and a $356,000 fine after being found guilty of racially abusing Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand. The incident occurred during Chelsea's English Premier League game against London rivals Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road last October. In July the 31-year-old had been found not guilty of a racially aggravated public order offence at Westminster Magistrates' Court. But the FA requires a lower burden of proof than an English court and after four-day hearing the Chelsea skipper was found guilty ""with using abusive and/or insulting words and/or behavior towards"" Ferdinand. Racism remains ""significant"" problem in English football . The defender will be available for Chelsea's game against Arsenal on Saturday as the ban will not come into effect until the end of the appeal process. This is the second high-profile case of racist abuse on the football field following the incident between Liverpool's Luis Suarez and Manchester United's Patrice Evra last year. Suarez gave 'unreliable' evidence to racial abuse hearing, says FA report . The Liverpool striker was banned for eight matches and fined $65,000 after being found guilty of misconduct, regarding ""using insulting words towards"" Evra during the game at Anfield on October 15 2011. Terry retires from England amid racism case . The verdict comes just days after Terry announced his retirement from international football. The Chelsea defender, who won 78 caps for his country, captained England in two separate spells. Terry claimed that the FA had made his position within the national team 'untenable'. His representatives, Elite Management, said in a statement released on his behalf: ""John Terry is disappointed that the FA Regulatory Commission has reached a different conclusion to the clear not guilty verdict of a court of law. ""He has asked for the detailed written reasons of the decision and will consider them carefully before deciding whether to lodge an appeal."" A statement from his club added: ""Chelsea notes and respects today's decision by the Football Association regarding John Terry. ""We also recognise that John has the right to appeal that decision. It is therefore inappropriate for us to comment further on the matter at this time."" Sports lawyer Daniel Geey told CNN that Terry might have only got a four-game rather than eight-match as the Chelsea captain only used the phrase once rather than seven times as Suarez was found to have done by the FA.","England's Football Association's hand $356,000 fine and four-match ban .

"Moscow (CNN) -- A plane carrying a hockey team with international players, including some NHL veterans, crashed as it took off Wednesday afternoon from Russia's Yaroslavl airport, killing at least 43 people, Russian emergency officials said. The Yak-42 aircraft was taking players for Lokomotiv Yaroslavl -- one of Russia's leading ice hockey teams -- to Minsk, the Belarusian capital, the Russian aviation authority told CNN. Two of the 45 people aboard the plane, which included eight crew members, survived, a Russian Emergency Situations Ministry representative said. Eleven of those on the aircraft were foreigners, the ministry said. Yaroslavl's regional governor, Sergei Vakhrukov, named the two survivors as Russian forward Alexander Galimov and flight crew member Alexander Sizov. Both are being treated in intensive care. Si.com: Plane crash darkens hockey's grim summer . Thirty-five bodies have been recovered from the crash site so far, the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry said, and the search for those still missing continued into the night. Many of the bodies were recovered from the Volga River after the plane crashed on its banks near the airport, the ministry said. The Lokomotiv team, which was scheduled to play a match Thursday in the new Kontinental Hockey League, had a number of players with ties to the National Hockey League. NHL.com cited Russia's Sov Sport website as confirming that the entire main roster of the team Lokomotiv Yaroslavl was on the plane, along with four players from the youth team. CNN.com: NHL feels loss of plane crash . The team's head coach, Brad McCrimmon, 52, who was born in Canada, previously played in the NHL and was an assistant coach with the Detroit Red Wings, NHL.com said. Others who played in the NHL included Karel Rachunek, 32, a Czech native; Ruslan Salei, 36, from Belarus; Karlis Skrastins, 37, from Latvia; Pavol Demitra, 36, from Slovakia; and Josef Vasicek, 30, from the Czech Republic. Demitra was a former Minnesota Wild and Vancouver Canucks center, RIA Novosti reported, while fellow center Vasicek was formerly with the New York Islanders and Carolina Hurricanes. Salei previously played for the Anaheim Mighty Ducks, Colorado Avalanche and the Red Wings. SI.com: Team tragedies . NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said the crash ""represents a catastrophic loss to the hockey world -- including the NHL family, which lost so many fathers, sons, teammates and friends who at one time excelled in our league. Our deepest condolences go to the families and loved ones of all who perished."" Lou Lamoriello, president of the New Jersey Devils, paid tribute to Alexander Vasyunov, a forward who played for the club last season, as ""an outstanding young man and a gifted athlete."" Rachunek also played for the Devils in 2007-08, Lamoriello said, adding: ""Both were members of the Devils family."" The Russian Hockey Federation expressed ""its deepest condolences to the bereaved families and relatives, fans and the entire hockey community"" in a statement on its website. A Kontinental Hockey League statement said: ""We are only beginning to understand the impact of this tragedy affecting the Lokomotiv Yaroslavl club on the friends we've lost and the international hockey community. ""First and foremost, our condolences go out to the families of the players, coaches and staff lost in today's tragedy. We know that there are many in the KHL family who will be grieving with us."" A national championship ice hockey match between Salavat Yulayev and Atlant was halted in the city of Ufa after reports of the crash. Players from both teams and spectators observed a moment of silence before leaving the stadium. Many in the audience were crying, Russian state TV footage showed. The president of the Russian national hockey league, Alexander Medvedev, took the microphone at the stadium to say representatives from both clubs had asked to call off the match because they had ties to those at Lokomotiv. He said: ""I would like to assure you that we'll do everything we can to make sure that the first-class ice hockey in Yaroslavl will continue and that the Lokomotiv club will remain as one of the strongest clubs in our Kontinental Hockey League."" An aviation agency spokesman, Sergei Izvolsky, told CNN the crash occurred around 4 p.m. (8 a.m. ET) during takeoff because the plane couldn't reach a safe altitude fast enough. The aircraft collided with the antenna of the airport beacon, fell to the ground and broke into several pieces and caught fire, Izvolsky said. It was a charter flight with a plane operated by Yak-Service Airlines, he said. Yaroslavl is about 155 miles (250 kilometers) northeast of Moscow. The Yakovlev Yak-42 was in proper technical order, the Russian Federal Aviation Agency's press officer, Andrei Pryanishnikov, told CNN. The plane went through cursory maintenance service before departure to Yaroslavl and fully complied with all safety standards, he said. The last time it underwent regular maintenance service was on August 16 in the city of Kazan. Pryanishnikov said the plane was manufactured in 1993 and was certified airworthy until October 1. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev instructed the country's Investigative Committee and other law enforcement agencies to probe the crash. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin also asked Transport Minister Igor Levitin to go to the scene to organize efforts to examine the cause of the crash, Putin's press office reported. The crash came as an international political forum opened in Yaroslavl, with participants expected to include Medvedev, the prime ministers of France, Spain and Italy and South Korean President Lee Myung-bak. Medvedev plans to visit the crash scene to pay tribute to the victims before attending the forum Thursday, the Kremlin press office said. CNN's Maxim Tkachenko, David Close, Josh Levs, Jennifer Deaton and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","The crash is ""a catastrophic loss to the hockey world,"" NHL commissioner says .

"(CNN)  -- The college students who showed up with bare midriffs and never contributed to discussions during Faye Rogaski's communication classes were surprised when they weren't picked for coveted internships and jobs. They would also e-mail the public relations executive without so much as a greeting but with demands such as ""I need a reference,"" or ""I need a letter of recommendation."" No ""please,"" no ""thank you,"" no face-to-face handshakes, introductions or follow-ups after classes. These same students would ""friend"" Rogaski on Facebook -- it was a class about branding yourself, after all, so the social networking site genuinely came into play from an academic standpoint. But Rogaski would find her Facebook newsfeed filled up with updates from these young adults posting salacious statements and tagging one another in drunken and/or raunchy photos. Rogaski was taken back by their behavior and wondered whether the students realized she was a potential future boss or colleague. That's when it clicked for her: Teach basic social skills to children because if they want to get far in life, manners are a requirement, not an option. She started socialsklz:-)  to help kids learn what they were not being taught at school. Socialsklz:-) logo includes a smiley face icon to convey its fun, interactive, hip relevance. Rogaski is quick to point out that these are not fancy manners and etiquette classes. ""It's not pinkies-up and pearls at high tea,"" Rogaski told CNN. She likens it more akin to ""Life Skills 101."" During a class for children 4 to 7, they were taught about the importance of eye contact and a firm, but not too tight,handshake. They were also led through basic greetings as well as proper phone etiquette when calling friends. The children practiced with each other in interactive scenarios. After being taught the principles of writing letters, they wrote thank you notes to their parents to highlight the importance of being thoughtful in life. In the coming weeks, they will learn online and text messaging etiquette as well as table manners and much more. Rogaski politely corrected kids on some basic errors, such as when one little girl kept saying ""ax"" when she really meant ""ask."" The 'tween group of 8- to 12-year-olds was slowly but surely being taught to drop their penchant for saying ""um,"" incorrect usage of the word ""like"" and uttering the dreaded phrase ""ya know."" The kids were issued cards called Frownies when they broke Rogaski's ""like, um, ya know"" rule and cards were counted up at the end of class. One little boy racked up 11 ""um"" Frownies. The 'tweens also went on a field trip to Dunkin' Donuts. On the way, one of the boys held the elevator for everyone while another held doors open. Each child ordered his or her own doughnut of choice and had to speak clearly and enunciate. Rogaski also encouraged them to have their selections ready so as not to hold up the line. The teen group, which meets for two hours a week, learns social graces as well as skills needed for college and job interviews. Penny Loretto, a career counselor at Skidmore College, warns the first few minutes of a job interview can mean the difference between getting a job or not. ""Appropriate dress attire, a firm handshake, a relaxed smile and maintaining direct contact are all essential elements of a good interview before the actual process even begins,"" says Loretto who previously worked in Human Resources for a large institution. And don't go to an interview without doing something else important she warns. ""The advice I usually give students and my adult clients is to be sure to practice, practice, practice,"" Loretto says. ""Practicing is the only way to become better at interviewing, and it's something all job candidates must take the time to do."" The socialsklz:-) teen students are also taught about e-mail etiquette and about the perils of posting something on a blog that they might regret later. They also learn the do's and don'ts of posting material on sites such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Young job seekers have to transition from being a family member, friend or student to a professional in their online communications, warns Jill Ferrall, assistant dean for career development in the School of Business at Quinnipiac University in Connecticut. She says don't be too casual and write things such as ""Hi FirstName,"" ""hey,"" ""thx,"" ""np."" And don't send a recruiter a friend request on Facebook. But within 24 hours after an interview with a potential employer, Ferrall says, the job applicant should write a thank you note. Rogaski said the real reward is when parents approach her and tell her that they see their kids using their newly acquired social skills out in the real world. She is also proud when she sees first-hand the confidence that her classes instill in her students.","Social skills are important to form as children to be successful later in life .
Teachers, career counselors and HR workers cringe at applicants' unsocial behavior .
Faye Rogaski started socialsklz:-) to teach children better manners ."
"(CNN) -- Police and fire officials in San Jose, California, are asking for the public's help to find the person responsible for setting roughly a dozen fires in the downtown area. Multiple fires were lit over several nights last week between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m., according to San Jose police, which released a statement and sketch of the suspect. No one was reported injured. ""These fires were very serious in nature and had the potential to cause serious injury or loss of life to both residents and firefighters,"" the statement read. Of the 10 fires set last week, five had residents inside when the blazes began, said Fire Capt. Christopher Murphy. Most were started on the outsides of the structures, which were downtown or south of downtown. Some structures were destroyed while others suffered minor to moderate damage. Eight of the 10 fires were set intentionally, while two remain under investigation, Murphy said. Firefighters responded Sunday to three more suspicious fires, which may have been set by the same suspected arsonist, CNN affiliate KGO reported. ""We want to make sure people clear out anything that's flammable from their front yards, and we want to make sure everybody sees the sketch of the suspect,"" said San Jose Councilmember Sam Liccardo, according to KGO. ""And we want to make sure that everyone who needs a fire alarm or batteries can get a fire alarm or batteries. We can supply it."" A $10,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or people responsible for the fires.
