"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Feedback: Departing hospital patients will be asked to rate their experience and whether they would recommend their ward . Hospital patients are to be asked whether they would . recommend their ward to friends and family, under new government guidance . issued yesterday. From April next year, every patient in England attending . A&E or admitted to a ward will be able to give the customer service-style feedback. Called the Friends and Family Test, the aim of the . initiative is to help hospitals to identify poor performance and encourage . staff to make improvements where services do not live up to patients' expectations. Upon leaving hospital, patients will be asked: ‘How likely are you to recommend our ward/A&E department to . friends and family if they needed similar care or treatment?’’ They will be given the choice of six options from ‘extremely . likely’ to ‘extremely unlikely’. Follow-up questions will be asked where . appropriate. The answers will be made public so that everyone has a clear . idea of which wards, A&E departments and hospitals are providing the best . care. THE WARD: . How likely are you to recommend our ward to friends and family if they needed similar care or treatment? A&E: . How likely are you to recommend our A&E to friends and family if they needed similar care or treatment? POSSIBLE RESPONSES: . Extremely likely . Likely . Neither likely nor unlikely . Unlikely . Extremely unlikely . Don't know . Patients will be able to register their feedback online, via text . messages, a smart phone app, telephone survey, postcard or ‘voting booth’ in . the hospital. It is hoped that at least 15 per cent of patients from each NHS Trust will respond. Day cases, maternity patients, outpatients, and those under 16 will not be asked to take part. Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, said: ‘We want the NHS . to treat patients as individuals, focus on making services more responsive to . their needs and ensure they have as positive an experience of care as . possible. ‘Patients need to be listened to and their feedback acted . upon. They also need to know that their hospital of choice is driving . improvements to provide the very best care. 'Rolling out the Friends and Family . Test in the wards and A&E departments of every hospital will make this a . reality across the NHS.’ The questionnaire was trialled in hospitals across the Midlands this summer and was generally well received. But the guidance has received a mixed response from Jocelyn Cornwell, who . works on patient experience at the King's Fund think-tank. Discreet: Patients can provide feedback via text message, smartphone app, email, post or phone . She told The Times: . ‘It's a very good thing to ask for patient feedback frequently. But there are . some problems with it. The guidance says that it will empower patients to . see themselves as customers and demand customer service. 'I think the language . of ""'customer"" is antithetical to how patients feel about themselves when they . are a patient... I don't think it will empower patients in any way because they don't choose . which A&E they go to and they don't choose their wards.’","From April, every NHS patient in England will be asked to give feedback on their stay .

"By . Damien Gayle . 'Hitchcock disguised as Molly': The director before he was famous, wearing a figure-hugging dress on the tennis court in Shoreham-by-Sea . Scroll down for video . It could have been the inspiration for Norman Bates. Or perhaps it's just a case of Hitchcock holiday japes. Whatever the story behind these remarkable pictures, they show the Psycho director in an entirely different light to the troubled genius whose legacy has been sullied by his reputation for cruelty. The previously unpublished album is believed to have belonged to director Graham Cutts, for whom the young Alfred Hitchcock worked as an assistant early in his film career. Dating from the early to mid-1920s, many of the pictures show Hitchcock, Cutts and others, including Hitchcock's future wife Alma Reville, in Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex, the location of a small film studio. They appear to be living a happy-go-lucky existence, play acting by the beach, rough housing in the sea and devouring film magazines, as they meanwhile work on pictures. These images date from just after the making of Cutts's hit film Woman To Woman, which brought him together with Hitchcock as assistant director in the Balcon-Saville-Freedman company. Notably, one captioned 'Hitchcock disguised as Molly. Shoreham. 1923' shows a young, moustachioed Hitchcock wearing a figure-hugging dress while gurning at the camera during a game of tennis. Cross-dressing killer Norman Bates was later to become one of the director's most-famous characters in the 1960 movie Psycho, a film which has come to define Hitchcock's style of psychological horror. Patrick McGilligan, a Hitchcock biographer, said that the dressing was probably just for a laugh. He told the Sunday Times: 'I know that Hitch did occasionally like to put on women's clothes, but just for fun at parties. 'These photos humanise Hitch, particularly as people now tend to think of him as a fat sadist.' Play acting: Hitchcock frolics with a woman called Ada and Graham 'Jack' Cutts, his then boss and mentor . Hard at work: The gang sit out on a late summer afternoon, reading issues of Kinematograph Weekly . Later photos in the collection show Hitchcock, Cutts and the others as they travelled Europe, searching for location for their next film, and in Germany as they shot the Anglo-German collaboration The Blackguard. By this time, Hitchcock was increasingly beginning to dominate over his old boss, making the acquaintance of luminaries of the German expressionist movement which was later to strongly influence his work. One amusingly glum image is that of 'Hans. Hitch, Alma, Jack, Ada. a Hun Germany 1924 Oct' pictured on a pleasure barge, seemingly on a day trip away from the film set. They appear to be not overly impressed by their escape from cosmopolitan, permissive Berlin and its manifold attractions. 'Hans. Hitch, Alma, Jack, Ada. a Hun Germany 1924 Oct': The gang on a day out in Germany, where they were filming the The Blackguard and Hitchcock began making connections with German expressionist filmmakers . Book dealer Christian White, who unearthed the photographs, has placed them on sale on Modernfirsteditions.com for £15,000. He said: 'This remarkable photographic collection, housed in a small domestic photo-album, documents in the most intimate and psychologically revealing manner the defining professional and personal relationships of Alfred Hitchcock's earliest years as a film-maker.' Anyone interested in seeing the album first hand can view it at the London International Antiquarian Bookfair at Olympia (Stand H07) from Thursday May 22 until Saturday May 24.","Incredible collection put up for sale by book dealer Christian White .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Seized: Police said investigators found a Batman mask similar to this one inside the apartment of James Holmes . Police have seized a Batman mask, other Batman paraphernalia and a computer from the apartment of a man suspected of opening fire at a midnight premiere of The Dark Knight Rises in Colorado. According to an official, a Batman poster was also hanging on a wall in James Holmes’ 850-square-foot apartment in Aurora. The discoveries were made after authorities finished clearing the 24-year-old’s home of booby traps and ammunition which he had allegedly left inside with the suspected intent to kill. It has been reported that Holmes told police he was the Joker, referring to the character played by Heath Ledger in the 2008 hit film The Dark Knight. The official said a computer that was  confiscated from the apartment could aid the effort to determine how long Holmes had been planning the attack and other details of the massacre. Holmes was arrested early Friday morning after authorities said he set off gas canisters inside a packed theater and shot unsuspecting movie-goers in an attack that killed 12 people and injured 58 others. A law enforcement source said when the killer rushed into the theater and opened fire, he encountered a technical glitch. Police said the alleged gunman came in armed with three weapons: a Remington shotgun, a Smith & Wesson M&P assault rifle and a Glock .40-caliber handgun. The assault rifle, which is similar to an AR-15 and is a civilian version of the military’s M-16, could fire 50 to 60 rounds per minute and is designed to hold large ammunition magazines. The source said that Holmes allegedly had obtained a 100-round drum magazine that attached to the weapon but that such large magazines are notorious for jamming, according to the Washington Post. Arch-rivals: The late actor Heath Ledger portrayed the Joker, left, in the 2008 blockbuster The Dark Knight opposite Christian Bale who played Batman, right . The law enforcement official said . authorities think the gunman first used the shotgun — some victims have . buckshot wounds — and then began using the assault rifle, which jammed. Then he resorted to the handgun. Aurora . Police Chief Dan Oates, interviewed on 'Fox News Sunday,' did not . confirm or deny that the gun jammed but said police found a 100-round . magazine on the theater floor. He said he did not know whether it was . empty. Some of the wounded victims interviewed by the press also said that the suspect's weapon jammed. Weapon of choice: A Smith & Wesson M&P assault rifle that Holmes had allegedly brought into the theater is said to have jammed . Law enforcement officials revealed . that Holmes has not been cooperating with them and that it could take . months to learn what prompted the attack. Holmes was being held in solitary . confinement at a Denver-area county detention facility, Aurora Police . Chief Dan Oates said, and is ‘lawyered up.’ ‘He's . not talking to us,’ the chief said. He is scheduled for an initial . hearing Monday, and has been assigned a public defender. Alter-ego: It has been reported that Holmes dyed his hair red and called himself the Joker after a character from the 2008 movie The Dark Knight . Meanwhile, University of Colorado . officials were looking on Sunday into whether Holmes used his position . in a graduate program to collect hazardous materials, but school . officials did not say whether they knew the suspect in a movie . theater massacre was anything more than a hard-working student. While the University of Colorado disclosed that it was cooperating with police in the case, that disclosure was one of the few the university has made three days after the massacre. It remained unclear whether Holmes' professors and other students at his 35-student PhD program noticed anything unusual about his behavior. Key resource: Police seized a computer from Holmes' apartment which they hope would shed light on the massacre . His reasons for quitting the program in June, just a year into the five- to seven-year program, also remained a mystery. Holmes recently took an intense, three-part oral exam that marks the end of the first year. Those who do well continue with their studies and shift to full-time research, while those who don't do well meet with advisers and discuss their options, including retaking the exam. University officials would not say if he passed, citing privacy concerns. The university declined to release any details of his academic record, citing privacy concerns, and at least two dozen professors and other staff declined to speak. Risky: Although police had cleared Holmes' apartment of booby traps and have finished collecting evidence, residents are still not allowed back into the building because of chemical hazards . Some said they were instructed not to talk publicly about Holmes in a blanket email sent to university employees. Jacque Montgomery, a spokeswoman for the University of Colorado medical school, said that police have told the school to not talk about Holmes. The university also took down the website for its graduate neuroscience program on Saturday. Police have finished collecting evidence from the apartment where the Colorado shooting suspect lived, but residents are still not allowed back into the building because of chemical hazards. Aurora police said Sunday residents can retrieve personal items, but the building remains closed.","Police seized a computer from James Holmes's Aurora apartment .

"By . Snejana Farberov . A four-day prostitution sting in Florida has led to the arrests of nearly 100 people, among them a former Orlando police officer. The 98 arrests on charges ranging from offering to commit lewd acts to aiding and abetting prostitution, child abuse and drug possession, took place over the Memorial Day weekend in Polk County. According to investigators, former Orlando police officer Michael Johnson, 44, was netted in the sting. When will they learn: Investigators in Polk County, Florida, arrested 98 people over the course of four days as part of a sex trafficking and prostitution sting operation . Johnson, who served on the force between 1994 and 1996, is accused of trying to recruit a female undercover officer as a prostitute. The former cop allegedly offered to act as the woman's pimp in exchange for 25 per cent of the profits. He then offered the would-be prostitute a better deal if she agreed to have sex with him, according to sheriff's officials. Bad cop: Former Orlando police officer Michael Johnson, 44, is accused of trying to recruit a female undercover detective as a prostitute . The list of suspects caught in the operation targeting human trafficking included 28 alleged prostitutes, among them a 15-year-old girl; 52 suspected clients, and 16 pimps. Of the 98 suspects, 24 were married; 15 are on public assistance; and 64 have been arrested over 448 times before. ‘Human trafficking is a serious problem in the Central Florida area. We have found that one of our best tools to find, arrest, and prosecute traffickers is to conduct undercover prostitution investigations,’ Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said in a statement. ‘Prostitution is not a victimless crime.’ The sting operation, aptly dubbed 'When Will You Learn,' stemmed from a 2013 arrest of suspected pimp Montavious Rakeem Postell accused of forcing a 15-year-old runaway to commit lewd acts for his own financial gain. When deputies interviewed the girl, she revealed to them that Postell had given her drugs, beat and sexually abused her. Investigators said in all, they have identified three potential cases of human trafficking. 'They . don’t have a choice, they’re given drugs, they’re watched, they’re held . against their will, they’re psychologically abused,' the sheriff said. Deanna Elimon, 20, was charged with child abuse by neglect for allegedly leaving a 5-year-old and a 1-year-old sleeping in an unlocked car while she went to have sex with a 'john,' John Alexander, who listed his trade on his Facebook page as ‘staying out of jail.’ Frank Portlock, 56, a co-owner of the Chevrolet Center in Winter Haven, was charged with trying to solicit an undercover female detective for sex in exchange for $100. Jalil Hayes, 25, a National Guardsman stationed in Georgia, was completing a job application when he allegedly offered to pay an undercover officer $40 to have sex with him. Frank Portlock, 56, (left), was charged with trying to solicit an undercover detective for sex; Deanna Elimon, 20 (right), was charged with child abuse for allegedly leaving two kids in a car while she went to have sex . Justin Link, 33, of Davenport, showed up for a rendezvous with a female detective, whom he wanted to recruit for sex with his friends, armed with cocaine, duct tape, two dog collars, high-heel shoes, a vibrator and lingerie, according to the Polk County sheriff’s office. Sheriff Grady Judd said some of the women arrested told officers they want to stop working as prostitutes, but they are afraid their pimps will kill them, the station WFTV reported. Judd said that an escort told investigators, ‘I had one of them tell me, “If you don’t come work for me, I’m going to throw acid in your face and burn you up.”’","Four-day prostitution sting in Florida, dubbed When Will You Learn, netted 98 suspects .

"By . Joshua Gardner . Monica Lewinsky is no stranger to being on the receiving end of some high profile scorn, but she recently revealed that learning Hillary blamed her for the affair proved to be the most unbearable insult of all. Lewinsky cited recently released papers from a longtime Hillary Clinton friend in which the former first lady called the once White House intern a 'narcissistic loony toon.' 'I find her impulse to blame the Woman...troubling,' Lewinsky wrote in Vanity Fair. Troubling the 40-year-old even further is the ever-present possibility Hillary will again run for president, a possibility Lewinsky admits she fears could drive her back into tormented seclusion. Blaming the woman: Monica Lewinsky doesn't like that recently revealed documents show that Hillary Clinton called her a 'loony toon' during the Clinton sex scandal . Putting on a smile: Lewinsky, seen here at a May 22 NYC gala, has had few reasons to be happy in the decade since she last ducked out of the public spotlight . Before she questions Hillary's feminism, Lewinsky first empathizes with the former first lady. 'Given my experiences with Linda Tripp, I know better than anyone what it’s like to have a conversation with a girlfriend exposed and scrutinized, taken out of context,' she writes. Clinton's 'loony toon' remark was one of many recently revealed comments she made on the subject to her own confidante Diane Blair. However, Lewinsky says the parallel is anything but precise. 'I realize that Hillary Clinton was—unlike me when Tripp was prying loose my innermost secrets and insecurities and recording them surreptitiously—fully aware of this documentation, . 'She’s the one who, according to the memos, asked Blair to keep a record or diary of their discussions for archival purposes.' No matter how humiliated the scandal left Hillary, it was Lewinsky who wound up being condemned by society, which is why she said she was infuriated to learn of Hillary's remarks. 'Narcissist? Loony?' wrote Lewinsky. 'You might remember that just five days before the world had ever heard my name the F.B.I. entrapped me in a terrifying “sting” in the Pentagon City mall.' Lewinsky went on to describe her . interrogation by Ken Starr's threatening minions, whose demands she wear . a wire tap while speaking with Clinton confidantes she refused. 'That, I couldn’t do. Courageous or foolish, maybe,' she wrote. Meanwhile, . as speculation around the possibility Hillary will make another run for . the White House builds, Lewinsky's response to the . will-she-or-won't-she question is: I hope not. 'In . 2008, when Hillary was running for president, I remained virtually . reclusive, despite being inundated with press requests. I put off . announcing several media projects in 2012 until after the election . 'Recently . I’ve found myself gun-shy yet again, fearful of “becoming an issue” should she decide to ramp up her campaign. But should I put my life on . hold for another 8 to 10 years? 'Being . a conscientious Democrat—and aware that I could be used as a tool for . the left or the right—I have remained silent for 10 years.,' wrote . Lewisnky. 'So why speak now? Because it is time.'

"By . Lydia Warren . The parents of missing mother Susan Powell are searching her father-in-law's former home in the hope that it will give some clues to her whereabouts. Chuck and Judy Cox went into convicted 'peeping Tom' Steven Powell's Washington home over the weekend, where they unearthed a box containing computer-coding files, among other, more personal items that belonged to their grandchildren, who were killed by their father in February 2012. The Coxes now hope that the coding files might contain information that could help the FBI reach information on a heavily-encrypted computer that was owned by Susan's husband, Josh Powell. They say they are not sure if her body could be found at the home, but they are bringing in cadaver dogs for the first time to check. Hope: Chuck Cox, the father of missing mother Susan Powell, shows the side of the house of Steven Powell, which they are searching with the permission of the new owners . Missed: Cox holds a sign previously belonging to his missing daughter and her husband, Josh, who died in 2012 . 'I don't know if we'll find her here . or not, but I know I have to continue the search, and this house has . never been searched by dogs,' Chuck Cox said. The couple and other helpers, including the authors of a book . about the case, have also discovered other more personal items, . including a beloved children's book, items of clothing and bicycle . helmets. 'It is sickening to see so many reminders . of Susan and her boys left behind by Steven Powell's family,' author Gregg Olsen . told The Huffington Post. 'To the Powells, those things appear to . be nothing more than junk. It indicates just how much they really cared . about the boys and their mother.' The family, who have been demanding answers since Susan vanished in 2009, will continue to search the home with help from volunteers over the coming weeks. Where is she? Susan Powell, pictured with her sons Braden and Charlie, vanished in 2009, aged 28 . Evidence? They said that a box containing computer-coding files could help them get into heavily encrypted files on Josh Powell's computer. The police have unsuccessfully tried to get into it for years . Treasures: They have also come across mementos - . such as books and clothing - of their two grandsons, who were killed by . their father in 2012 after he blew up their home - also killing himself . Steven Powell's home was recently sold . as part of restitution to the parents of the girls he took naked . pictures of while they were in their bathroom next door. Law enforcement found the sordid . photographs of the little girls, aged eight and 10, while looking for evidence of his missing daughter-in-law. He was released from prison in March after serving two years for taking photographs of two girls, aged eight and ten in 2011. Powell . is on probation for 30 months, required to wear a GPS locator and . attend a sex-offender treatment program. He lives in Tacoma, according . to the corrections facility. Search: The couple believes Steven Powell, who was later jailed for voyeurism charges, knows more information about their daughter's disappearance than he has said . Uncertainties: The couple have said they do not know if their daughter's body will be found at the house . Discoveries: The couple have found reminders of their grandsons in the home, such as this sled, left. They hope that files and other items in the home could give them clues about when their daughter is . The two girls victimized by Powell were awarded a $1.8million settlement as part of a civil suit. During Powell's voyeurism trial, the girls' parents became friends with Chuck and Judy Cox and, after they were given the home, they agreed to allow a private search of the home with dogs. Anne Bremner, the neighbors' lawyer, told MailOnline: 'Chuck is never giving up hope.' She added that the family do not know whether Mrs Cox Powell is alive or dead. It appears that cadaver dogs were not . used to search the home at the time because they were not covered by . warrants obtained by West Valley Police and Pierce County Sheriff's . Department to go into Powell's property, Ms Bremner said. Happier times: Chuck and Judy Cox, are pictured with their grandsons, Charlie (left) and Braden . (right) 'They didn't have the access we have now, they only had narrowly tailored warrants,' the attorney explained. The mother-of-two Susan Powell, 28, disappeared from her home in West Valley City in December 2009. She has never been found. Josh has claimed that his wife was at . home when he took his sons, Charlie and Braden, on a winter camping trip . in Utah's West Desert. The Cox family claims that Steven Powell has information about his missing daughter-in-law. It was suspected that she was killed by her husband Josh Powell but he never faced charges in the case. In 2012, he attempted to murder his . sons, Charles, seven, and five-year-old Braden with a hatchet before . setting his home alight, killing them and himself. What did he know? Powell, pictured after his wife vanished, reportedly ordered his wife around in their home . Theories: The new insights were shared by . friends in a book out Tuesday, left. It also suggests that one of the . sons may have been sexually assaulted by Josh's father Steve, pictured . in court, right . In a new book, 'If I Can’t Have You: Susan Powell, Her Mysterious Disappearance, and the Murder of Her Children', friends claimed Josh Powell poisoned his wife before she vanished, kept food from their sons and even sexually abused the young boys. Two weeks ago, cadaver dogs were used in a privately-funded and volunteer-based search of a rural home close to Salem, Oregon for signs of Susan Cox Powell. Her husband's aunt and uncle had been renting the property at the time of her disappearance in 2009. No signs of Susan's remains were found.","Susan's body has never been found and Josh killed himself and his sons in 2012 after attacking them with a hatchet and blowing up their home .

"By . Tara Brady . An Oklahoma man has become the second person to die in the U.S. of the new 'Heartland' virus which is carried by ticks. The Department of Health said the man, who is over 65, was from Delaware County in north-east Oklahoma and died from complications from the virus. The virus is found in the lone star tick and is spread through tick bites. An Oklahoma man has died in the U.S. of the new 'Heartland' virus which is carried by lone star ticks (pictured) It was first identified in Missouri in 2009. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention has said the other patient who died had other health conditions. Other cases have been diagnosed in Missouri and Tennessee but those patients have recovered. Similar to previous cases, the Oklahoma victim had a history of outdoor activities and exposure, said Becky Coffman, an epidemiologist in acute disease with the Oklahoma Health Department. Delaware County where a man died from the virus. Cases have also been recorded in Missouri and Tennessee . Symptoms include fever, fatigue, headaches, muscle aches, loss of appetite, nausea, bruising easily and diarrhea. The lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum, is found throughout the eastern, southeastern and south-central states. They have been recorded in large numbers as far north as Maine and as far west as central Texas and Oklahoma. All three life stages (larva, nymph, adult) of the lone star tick will feed on humans, and may be quite aggressive. Lone star ticks will also feed readily on other animals, including dogs and cats, and may be brought into the home on pets. The saliva from lone star ticks can be irritating; redness and discomfort at a bite site does not necessarily indicate an infection. People should monitor their health closely after any tick bite, and should consult their physician if they experience a rash, fever, headache, joint or muscle pains, or swollen lymph nodes within 30 days of a tick bite. These can be signs of a number of tickborne diseases. There is no vaccine or drug to prevent or treat the illness. Since its discovery, the Heartland Virus has killed two people and infected eight others. Coffman said people who become ill after spending a lot of time outdoors should disclose to physicians if they have a history of tick bites to help reach a correct diagnosis. The incubation period before the onset of symptoms of the Heartland virus is unknown but symptoms caused by other tick-borne illnesses generally begin two weeks after infection, Coffman said. 'We need to help doctors,' she said. 'We need to give them as much information as we can to give them some clues.' Coffman said campers and others who spend a lot of time outdoors should check themselves 'at least daily' for ticks. Although there is no routine testing available for Heartland virus, protocols are in place for investigational diagnostic testing. The state Health Department recommends using insect repellents, wearing long-sleeved shirts and trousers when outdoors, avoiding bushy and wooded areas where ticks thrive and conducting thorough tick checks after spending time outside. 'They can cause a lot of damage,' said Dr Kathryn Zackery, of the Sapulpa Indian Health Center. According to Dr Zackery, Sapulpa patients visit the health center during the spring and summer months. 'We saw cases several times per week last summer,' she said. An engorged female lone star tick which has been blamed for the Heartlands virus . Heartland virus belongs to a family of viruses called Phleboviruses. Viruses in this family are found all over the world. Some of these viruses can cause people to get sick. Most of the phleboviruses that cause people to become ill are passed through the bite of a mosquito, tick, or sandfly. It is not yet fully known how people become infected with Heartland virus. However, recent studies suggest that ticks, namely Lone Star ticks, may transmit the virus. As of March 2014, eight cases of Heartland virus disease had been identified among residents of Missouri and Tennessee. Since the Heartland virus was first described in 2012 and there have only been a few cases, scientists are still learning about it. So far, all patients diagnosed with Heartland virus disease became sick during May-September. They all had a fever and felt very tired. Some also complained of headaches, muscle aches, diarrhea, losing their appetite, or feeling sick to their stomach. They all had low numbers of cells that fight infection and that help blood clot. Most patients required hospitalisation for their illness. Most patients fully recovered, but now two patients have died. People who work or do activities outside, where they are exposed to ticks or insects, may be more likely to be infected. There is no vaccine or drug to prevent or treat the disease. Preventing bites from ticks and mosquitoes may prevent this and other infections.","Department of Health said the man was from Delaware County .

'Everyone was an immigrant and somehow, everyone co-existed', states James Wyckoff, a distant descendant of the family who first owned it, on a Vimeo film about the building's history. He goes on to point out that New York remains a melting pot of cultures to this day. The house was built by an illiterate teenage farm laborer called Pieter Claesen Wyckoff, who had just arrived from Europe. Educational: The house has been altered and restored many times over the course of its lengthy history, and now stands as a museum of what life was like in Colonial times . As it was: The house was built by an illiterate Dutch farm laborer called Pieter Claeson Wyckoff, who had just arrived from Europe to make a new life for himself and his wife Grietie . Mr Wyckoff and his wife Grietie van Nes settled . in the area, then known as New Amsterdam and now Brooklyn's East . Flatbush, around half an hour's drive from the center of Manhattan. He went on to become a successful farmer and magistrate, bore 11 children and now has more than 50,000 descendants. His house was enlarged, altered, and has switched hands many times over the space of four centuries, but has always remained in the Wyckoff family and maintained its structural foundations. Inside: A peek inside the ancient home, which has been set up and filled with artifacts to make it look like it might have in its early days . Humble beginnings: Pieter Wyckoff eventually became a successful farmer and magistrate and had 11 children, resulting in more than 50,000 descendants since . James Wyckoff, who is now on the museum's advisory board, is immensely relieved that local children managed to deter the vandalism which threatened the building during the 1950s. 'They really saved the house', says Mr Wyckoff. In 1965 it became the first structure to . be designated a New York City Landmark and in 1982, it opened to the public, complete with colonial artifacts and an interior set up that mirrors how it might have looked all those years ago. Family values: A group of local children saved the house from vandalism in the 1950s, ultimately saving the prized historical building so that it could go on to be enjoyed by others (pictured, an unknown previous family) 'Students learn what it was like to live in New Amsterdam in the 17th . century', Mr Wyckoff explains. 'You didn't have anywhere to escape and play video games.' If there's one thing he would like visitors to leave the house with, it's a sense of community, he says. The Wyckoff Farmhouse Museum is owned by the New . York City Department of Parks & Recreation, operated by the Wyckoff . House & Association, and is a member of the Historic House Trust.","Built by Pieter Claesen Wyckoff, an illiterate teen farmer who had 11 children and now has more than 50,000 descendents .

"By . Lydia Warren . Duck Dynasty star Alan Robertson has come to his homophobic father's defense in an impassioned speech, branding him a '21st Century prophet' who is being punished for speaking 'truths'. Following in the footsteps of his father's religious rants, Alan, the oldest son of Phil Robertson, made the comments in an address at the Watchmen on the Wall conference in Washington D.C. last week. He explained that the outcry at his father's December interview in GQ magazine - in which he likened homosexuality to . bestiality - had not changed his views. 'It hasn't changed us one bit, who we are, what we believe and what we teach other people. And it won't,' he told the audience in a video of the speech. Scroll down for videos . Defense: Alan Robertson, son of Duck Dynasty patriarch Phil Robertson, defended his father in a speech last week and branded him a '21st Century prophet' for maintaining his beliefs despite outcry . In a bizarre move, he then compared his father to John the Baptist, saying the two men looked alike, lived similar lives and were both attacked for speaking the truth. 'My dad, Phil Robertson, has the heart and the mindset of a prophet… long hair, long beard, naturally camouflaged, he ate off the land and he pointed people to Christ,' Alan said, RadarOnline first reported. '[John] also lost his head for speaking the truth in a culture that really wasn’t prepared to hear truth. 'And yet, you know what - that doesn't change dad's view at all. Prophets tend to not care about their public image, they tend to talk about judgment as if it’s real and they speak what God gives them to speak and that's what my dad does. He is in that sense a 21st Century prophet.' In hot water: Robertson, 68, was briefly suspended from Duck Dynasty last December following an interview . Alan was a pastor for two decades before he went back into the family business making duck calls. He and his wife Lisa joined his parents and siblings on Duck Dynasty last year. Alan Robertson . Despite A&E briefly dropping Phil Robertson from the show after the scandal in December, he has not kept quiet about his homophobic views. Just last month, he was filmed giving an Easter Sunday sermon at Whites Ferry Road Church in his hometown of West Monroe, Louisiana on April 20, according to a video on YouTube. In the footage, the 68-year-old expresses his anger at the outcry over his December interview. 'They were mad at me,' he tells the congregation in the video. 'You say, ""why'd they get mad at you?"" Cuz instead of acknowledging their sin, like you had better do, they railed against me for giving them the truth about their sins. Don't deceive yourselves.' Rant: In an Easter Sunday sermon at his Louisiana church, Duck Dynasty patriarch Phil Robertson complained about the outrage against him following his homophobic comments last year . It emerged just five months after Robertson, a born-again Christian, gave the controversial GQ interview. 'Everything is blurred on what’s right and what's wrong. Sin becomes fine,' he said in the interview. 'Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there. 'Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men... Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers - they won't inherit the kingdom of God.' His homophobic comments also included such insights as: 'It seems like, to me, a vagina - as a man - would be more desirable than a man's anus. 'That's just me. I’m just thinking: There’s more there! She's got more to offer. I mean, come on, dudes! You know what I'm saying? But hey, sin: It's not logical, my man. It's just not logical.' On the show: Alan, a former pastor, is pictured renewing his parents' vows in season four of Duck Dynasty . Family: Alan is the only non-bearded member of the Robertson family, who made their millions from duck calls . He also grouped homosexuals with terrorists, saying, 'We never, ever judge someone on who's going to heaven, hell. That's the Almighty's job. We just love 'em, give 'em the good news about Jesus - whether they're homosexuals, drunks, terrorists. We let God sort 'em out later, you see what I'm saying?' After the interview emerged, Robertson was put on indefinite hiatus from Duck Dynasty. While his removal was lauded by gay rights organizations, fans of the show denounced it as a violation of his right to free speech. Conservative . supporters included Sarah Palin, who wrote in a Facebook post: 'Free . speech is an endangered species. Those intolerants' hatin' and taking on . the Duck Dynasty patriarch for voicing his personal opinion are taking . on all of us.' A&E . initially said his views were 'disappointing' but two weeks later, they . announced that Robertson would be included when they began filming . again in the new year. Uncertain future: Duck Dynasty (the cast is pictured) has seen lower ratings since the tirade last year . 'After discussions with the Robertson family, as well as consulting with numerous advocacy groups, A&E has decided to resume filming Duck Dynasty later this spring with the entire Robertson family,' the network said in a statement. Robertson also released a public apology saying, in part: 'I would never treat anyone with disrespect just because they are different from me. 'We are all created by the Almighty and like Him, I love all of humanity. We would all be better off if we loved God and loved each other.' Whether or not this latest rant will affect his position on the show - which has suffered falling ratings since the first tirade - has yet to be seen. The show is scheduled to begin its sixth season on June 11.

"By . Richard Alleyne In Los Angeles . and Will Payne In Woodland Hills, California . The mother of a childhood friend of virgin killer Elliot Rodger has today told of her daughter's 'total shock' at being named in his bitter manifesto. Rodger, 22, first met the girl, the daughter of a British 1980s popstar, when he moved to California aged five - but in his twisted rant he said she came to 'represent everything I hate and despise.' And clearly shaken, her mother told MailOnline at her home: 'It's a nightmare, she's shocked. The Rodger family are very dear friends of ours. I cannot believe what they are going through. They gave that boy everything. Everything he needed. He was everything to them.' Scroll down for videos . Distraught: The mother of a childhood friend of Virgin killer Elliot Rodger railed against in his manifesto today said her daughter was in 'total shock' Childhood pal: The young woman was one of Elliot Rodger's first friends after he moved to the States . 'I have spoken to them and out of respect I do not want to say anything.' However, she added: 'Our hearts are full of kindness and empathy for everyone affected.' In his manifesto, written shortly before he went on a rampage and . killed six students at the University of California, Rodger went on a . tirade about the girl who was his first friend in Los Angeles. She is one of many girls, men and parents who Rodger spewed hatred at as he wrote his sick manifesto in a twisted bid to justify his horrific actions. During their childhood, he claimed the pair were close, even sharing baths . together as the two families socialised at parties and barbecues at each . other’s houses. But as the pretty blonde grew into a sociable college student, Elliot became a troubled recluse. Rodger wrote of the girl: ‘I was a 5 year old boy playing with a girl my own age like any normal boy would do. ‘I was enjoying life in a world that I loved. I . was happy, and completely oblivious of the fact that my future on this . world would only turn to darkness and misery because of girls. ‘This girl who was my friend, (she) would eventually come to represent everything I hate and despise; everything that is against me, and . everything that I'm against. I was playing innocently with this girl, in . the manner that all children play. We even took baths together; it was . the only time in my life that I would see a girl my age naked.' Enacting . his 'revenge' on society, Rodger stabbed three of his housemates to death at his home . before shooting dead two sorority sisters and another male student in . Santa Barbara on Friday. Sick: Elliot Rodger, 22, stabbed three people in his home and shot dead three other students before he took his own life on Friday. The rampage came after he posted rants online about how women hated him . London-born . Rodger was raised in West Sussex, England, attending £18,000-a-year prep . school Dorset House, before moving to California with his parents, Hunger Games director Peter Rodger and his ex-wife Chin, . His former friend also emigrated to LA as a child after her father hit the big time with his band. Rodger, son of Hunger Games assistant director Peter Rodger, regularly went to her home. The two stayed in touch through their families until August last year when she went to his house for dinner. However, . he later stalked her on Facebook and concluded that she and her friends . at the University of Southern California were 'spoiled.' He . wrote: 'I would take great delight in torturing and flaying her and . every single one of her spoiled, obnoxious, evil friends.' The girl's stepfather also added: 'We are absolutely devastated. It is a tragedy that so many young lives have been lost. Our thoughts are with their families. The Rodgers are good people. I knew Elliot as well. It is just incredibly sad. 'Now I just want to protect my daughter and do what is best for her.' Rodger, who had Asperger's Syndrome, emailed his manifesto to his parents and his psychiatrist before going on the rampage in Santa Barbara. First he stabbed to death his fellow students Weihan Wang, 20, and Cheng Yuan Hong, 20, at their shared apartment. The body of another student, George Chen, 19, was also found there. His next victims were Veronica Weiss, 19, and Katherine Cooper, 22, both shot outside a student house near the campus. He then drove in his black BMW 3 Series to a grocery store and opened fire, killing his sixth victim, English major Christopher Michael-Martinez, 20. Today, family friend and spokesman Simon Astaire said the Rodger family are 'grieving for those innocents who lost their lives, above their own son'. Mr Astaire has spent the last few days with Chin, Peter and his second wife Soumaya and he says they are so upset they can 'barely string a sentence together'. Dad: The killer wrote in his manifesto that he . didn't want to kill his father, Peter, pictured left with his sister . Georgia, because he wasn't sure he could follow through . Close: Georgia and her mother Linchin Rodger pictured on a recent vacation . He said: 'They are absolutely crippled . by grief. I know them very well and it is incredibly hard to be in . their company, because they are so distraught. It is hard to be near . them because they are so devastated. 'I . can tell you that they are grieving for those who've lost their lives . before their own son. They really are, that's where they are. I can't . imagine the confusion there must be in that?' As well as launching a tirade against his childhood friend, Rodger also branded model Monette Moio an 'evil b****' and blamed her for his hatred of women. He claimed the stunning blonde 'teased and ridiculed' him after they met at school, sparking his vendetta against female kind. 'The way I was treated by . girls at this time, especially by that evil b**** sparked . an intense fear of girls,' he wrote. 'The funny part of this is that I had a secret . crush on Monette. She was the first girl I ever had a crush on, and I . never admitted it to anyone . However, . Monette's father, Hollywood stuntman John Moio, has defended his . daughter, saying it is ridiculous to even suggest she played a part in . Rodger's spiral into a mass murderer. Speaking from his home in West Hills, . California, he told MailOnline: 'She was ten years old for God's sake - . she can barely remember the guy. He's a sociopath. She hasn't seen him . since school.' 'She's . devastated over the whole thing,' he went on. 'It's like she's being . implicated in this terrible tragedy for something she hasn't done and . can't remember.' He added that Rodger's claims that Monette had 'teased' him were impossible. 'How . is a ten-year-old girl going to bully a 12-year-old boy?' he asked. 'Maybe the girls she hung around with did poke fun at him, but they were . kids. 'My daughter was not a bully, she's . one of the sweetest people you could ever meet. She probably rejected . his aggressive advances. If you want to call that bullying then fine.' Mr Moio added that he and his daughter only remember Rodger as a 'strange kid'. Victims: Rodger's first victims included his roommates Weihan Wang, left, and Cheng Yuan Hong, right . Gunned down: George Chen, left, was also found . stabbed to death in their home - although he did not live at the house - . while Rodgers gunned down Chris Michael-Martinez, right, when he opened . fire at a deli . Loss: Katie Cooper, left, and Veronika Weiss were standing outside a sorority house when they were shot . 'He . was weird then and he's weird now,' he said. 'He had a secret crush on . her, but she was completely unaware of him. She had no idea... If you think about it, he could have killed her, he could have come after her. 'I was hands on at that school and I . don't remember him. She just remember that he was a strange kid, she . knew he wasn't a normal type person, but there are a lot of people like . that at that age.' But he added that his sympathy was with . Rodger's parents - who alerted the police to the manifesto after they . received a copy - and for the six young victims. He also had some . sympathy for the killer. 'I also feel sorry for him because he . obviously wasn't getting the proper help,' he said. 'From what I . understand he was receiving psychological help two years before he met . my daughter. I am not here to judge anyone.' He added: 'My heart goes out to the victims' families.

But he was asked by the families of Cheng Yuan Hong and Weihan 'David' Wang, to give statements on their behalf. As he held a Gone With The Wind book bag aloft, Mr Martinez read a statement from the Hong family, which said: 'May we together create a peaceful world and let hatred be gone with the wind.'

"By . Tara Brady . Military veteran Charlie Mayes, 40, was charged with child cruelty . A father has been arrested for child cruelty after punishing his teenage son by making him carry a 23-pound paving slab for miles. Military veteran Charlie Mayes, 40, from Douglasville, Georgia, told police he used military-style punishment because his son watched too many videos and didn't do his chores and school work. According to Police Sergeant Todd Garner, of Douglasville Police, the 16-year-old boy was made to carry the paving slab several times over a three-day period. He was sometimes made to get up and carry the slab for miles at around three o'clock in the morning. A pizza delivery driver called Joshua Burnette alerted police after spotting the struggling teenager on one of his punishment walks. He told Douglas County Sentinel: 'I got to work and saw him there and I asked if he was alright. 'He was sweating, dirty and was obviously tired. He asked if I could give him a ride so I checked with my boss and he said it was okay. 'He picked up this massive brick and asked if he could put in in the truck.' Burnette then spotted the boy a few hours later walking with the slab in temperatures reaching 90F. After quizzing the boy, the driver discovered that the teenager had been made to walk with the brick as punishment and that he had to do the walk within two hours or face doing the whole thing again. One walk was also captured in the background of a police dash cam video during an unrelated traffic stop but this footage has not yet been released. The boy, who is only 4ft 2in tall, was also punished in-between the three-mile hikes. Torture: Charlie Mayers made his 16-year-old son carry this 23-pound paving slab for miles as punishment . Srgt . Garner told 11Alive: 'In between that time, he was at home having to move rocks . and stuff from one side of the back yard to the other and then being . taken right back out to the same location and dropped off and made to . walk back again.' Police Sgt Garner said: 'He did not feel that this was inappropriate at all and neither did his wife.' Mayers said the boy had a history of problems at school and that his parents finally decided to home school him. However, Mayers said the problems continued. He told Judge Joel Dodson: 'I had tried everything else and nothing seemed to work. 'I know it may be an adult punishment and he is a 16-year-old boy. It was something we did when I was in the military. 'The sergeant would have us move rocks. I know how it sounds, but we did that all the time.' Mayes was charged with first-degree child cruelty which he admitted. A woman who answered the door at the family house said they had no comment. Mayers was released from jail on a $3,500 bond and a judge ordered the father to receive family counseling.","Military veteran Charlie Mayes, 40, is from Douglasville, Georgia .

"By . Wills Robinson . Donald Sterling has shown his face at an upmarket steak restaurant just hours after insisting there was 'no basis ' to strip him of the LA Clippers after making racist remarks during a 'lovers' tiff'. He waved to cameras as he was driven away from Mastros in Beverley Hills just hours after the NBA tried to oust him as part of the ongoing race row. The 80-year-old businessmen, who bought the side in 1981, has said there is no basis to strip him of his team because his statements were illegally recorded 'during an inflamed lovers' quarrel in which he was clearly distraught.' Donald Sterling, the disgraced owner of the LA Clippers, leaves Mastro's' Steak House in Beverly Hills following attempts by the NBA to oust him . Hiding: One passenger in the back seat of the car covered their face as the 80-year-old businessman left the upmarket restaurant. It cams just hours af . According to the response, . a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press, Sterling says V. Stiviano recorded him without his knowledge and thus the recording was . illegal under California law. He also said he could not have 'willfully' damaged the league because he did not know it would be made public. 'A jealous rant to a lover never intended to be published cannot offend the NBA rules,' Sterling said in the document, which was first reported by USA Today. Meanwhile, the attorney for Shelly Sterling said that Donald Sterling has given her written permission to sell the team. Argument: The comments were made between Sterling and V.Stivano (left) during what the owner described as a 'lovers' tiff' Illegal? Sterling claims that his remarks were private and not meant to 'take a position' that damaged the NBA . According to a person who is in . contact with a potential bidder, who spoke to the Associated Press . anonymously, the Clippers are seeking binding bids before next . Tuesday — the day NBA owners are scheduled to meet in New York and vote . on whether to strip Sterling of the team. Donald Sterling said in the response's cover letter he has already received 'offers in excess of $2.5billion for the purchase of the team.' A bidder told the Los Angeles Times 'bids . are due Thursday afternoon at 2pm. We will probably know who bought the . team by Friday.' The league . said in a statement Tuesday that if three-quarters of the 30 owners . voted to sustain the charge, 'the Sterlings' interests in the Clippers . will be terminated and the team will be sold.' The . NBA charged Donald Sterling with damaging the league and its . merchandising partners, and the league's constitution gave him until the . end of Tuesday to respond. According to a basketball official familiar . with the proceedings, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was . not authorized to discuss Sterling, the NBA has scheduled a call of its . executive committee for 3 p.m. EDT on Wednesday. Mistress: V.Stiviano, pictured, recorded Sterling's remarks during an argument . Shelly Sterling submitted her own separate response to the NBA's charges Tuesday that included a 'vigorous defense of the attempt by the NBA to blame her for doing nothing wrong,' according to a person with knowledge of the proceedings. The individual wasn't authorized to speak publicly about the response. In his response, Donald Sterling says that next week's hearing cannot be fair because the owners have already made up their minds, quoting 10 teams who commented on Twitter or elsewhere that they supported the seizure of the team. An AP survey on the day Commissioner Adam Silver announced Sterling's lifetime ban found that half of the teams supported it and no owner was against it. 'These proceedings will be a spectacle meant to mollify the popular opinion, not a fair and impartial hearing: the outcome of these proceedings became a foregone conclusion weeks ago,' the response states. The response also notes the disparity . between his lifetime ban and $2.5 million fine and previous NBA . punishments, including the $100,000 fine levied on Kobe Bryant when he . was caught referring to a referee as a homosexual slur, and the 72-game . suspension of Ron Artest for punching a fan. Trying to sell? Shelly Sterling, pictured, is reportedly trying to sell the Los Angeles Clippers before next Tuesday . The NBA said Sterling is in violation because his racist comments were harmful to the league and its business partners, including the players. Agreement: Shelly Sterling's attorney said that Donald Sterling has given her written permission to sell the team . Sterling's response argues that because his comments came in the privacy of his girlfriend's living room he cannot be considered 'taking a position' that damaged the NBA, as required under the league constitution. 'Mr. Sterling was not ""conducting"" the ""sport of professional basketball"" when he was arguing with Ms. Stiviano in her living room,' the response says. 'Not even the Commissioner alleges that Mr. Sterling intended to harm the NBA with his comment. Nor could he. This was an argument between a jealous man and the woman he loved that should never have left the privacy of his living room.' Sterling's recent comments on African-Americans' helping one another and Magic Johnson to Anderson Cooper 'do not violate the NBA Constitution,' the response says. The response also says that Sterling is . locked out of his office at the Staples Center and is unable to respond to . allegations that his behavior has 'a material adverse impact on the . NBA.' Sterling also noted his history of supporting racial diversity, including five black head coaches and a black general manager, Elgin Baylor, who held the job for 22 years. Baylor eventually unsuccessfully sued Sterling, accusing him of racist behavior. It also notes that he was due to receive his second lifetime achievement award from the NAACP before the recording of his comments was leaked. The response claims that it would cost Sterling $300 million to $500 million in capital gains taxes if he is forced to sell now rather than pass the team to his heirs.","Team owner waved as he left Mastros Steak House in Beverly Hills .

"By . Chris Pleasance . A Romanian actress and TV presenter has been arrested after allegedly trying to blackmail a doctor into giving her a free boob job. Oana Zavoranu, 40, had already paid for seven breast operations from Dr Marek Valcu at his clinic in Bucharest, Romania, but became upset after she thought he was conning her. She allegedly began messaging the doctor, demanding £7,000 and another surgery for free, after becoming convinced he had used taxpayer money meant for burn victims to fund her operation. Oana Zavoranu, 40, allegedly tried to blackmail her plastic surgeon, Dr Marek Valcu, into giving her free breast implants and £7,000 despite already having seven operations . Zavoranu had already undergone seven surgeries at the clinic, but after becoming unhappy with the results of the latest operation, began making threats . Zavoranu also believed that Dr Valcu had used state hospital facilities for her surgery, then billed her for the cost. Many Romanian medics work in both private and public health, and there are often allegations that medics use state operating rooms and medicine to treat private patients, then bill private clients for their use. Yet instead of reporting it to police, she contacted the doctor directly and demanded that he pay her money to keep quiet and carry out another boob job. He in turn reported that she was trying to blackmail him to police and officers set up a sting operation that resulted in her being arrested as the cash was handed over. 'She texted him to say that she was unhappy with her last boob job,' said a police spokesman. 'The message was quite threatening, asking for another breast implant job and cash to boot. She threatened to reveal ""compromising information"" about him if he did not pay up. Police say Zavoranu threatened to reveal Dr Valcu was using money for burn victims to fund plastic surgery . Dr Valcu tipped off the police and when Zavoranu turned up to collect the cash she was arrested . 'She claimed that the clinic was using funds meant for burns victims but we have no evidence of this. 'She said she could prove his involvement in an illegal plastic surgery network.' Police in Bucharest did recently arrest medical staff at the Burns Hospital on suspicion of using state money for breast implants, but have not found any evidence against Dr Valcu. Dr Valcu added: 'She counted the money, took it and put it on the back seat of her car. I gave her the full amount, otherwise the police set-up would not have had anything to arrest her for.' The police spokesman added. 'She is being questioned and a report is . being prepared that will be handed to prosecutors who will decide how to . proceed. 'If she has any evidence to back up her claims they will be . considered. For the moment, she is remaining in investigative custody.' Police did investigate a Romanian hospital for using money for burn victims to fund cosmetic surgery, but Dr Valcu was not involved in the scandal .","Oana Zavoranu, 40, had seven breast surgeries at clinic in Bucharest .

"By . Freya Noble . An increase to medical research funding by the Cancer Council means that research into the causes of cancer using vinegar flies can be sped up. The research looks in to cell growth using the insects, and the findings will later be tested on mice and eventually implemented in human treatment. According to news.com.au The University of Melbourne is working with teams from the National Institute of Health in America and the Peter MacCallum Centre to examine a gene which plays a key role in allowing the formation of cancers. Vinegar flies are being used in research which hopes to discover more about a certain gene which can affect cancer growth . The MYC gene has been identified as one which drives cell growth and allows cells to overgrow and cancer to take over if it's turned up too high. In cancer cells the gene is often too present, and Dr Leonie Quinn told the website vinegar flies are ideal to use to work out of to turn the gene on and off. They are suitable because they present the same MYC gene as in mice and humans, and understanding the function of the gene could later lead to the development of new cancer drugs. The MYC gene present in flies are also present in mice and humans and may help researches develop new cancer drugs . 'Cell growth is the first step in a cancer taking off in a person. If we can stop that, then that’s how we are going to save lives,' said Dr Quinn. The vinegar flies also offer an inexpensive and quick insight into how the gene functions. This project is one of 11 studies which have been funded by a $3million grant in the form of the Cancer Council's Grants-in-Aid program. CEO Todd Harper said the grants are all from donors, the website reported.","Vinegar flies are used to learn more about the growth of cancer-causing cells .

"By . Associated Press . Venezuela's government is implicating the U.S. ambassador to Colombia in a plot to destabilize President Nicolas Maduro's rule. Leaders of the ruling socialist party on Wednesday presented what they said were emails written by ousted lawmaker Maria Corina Machado to members of the opposition. In one dated March 23 Machado describes how Kevin Whitaker offered his support to the opposition and indicated 'new steps'. Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro seen speaking during a meeting with mayors and governors at Miraflores Palace in Caracas last week . At the time Whitaker oversaw Andean affairs at the State Department. Officials didn't say how the emails were obtained. A State Department spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity said the allegations are baseless and an effort by Maduro's government to distract attention from grievances fueling anti-government protests. The accusations come as U.S House of Representatives is set to vote on imposing sanctions against Venezuelan officials. Fourteen Democratic members of Congress were voicing opposition to authorizing unilateral U.S. sanctions against Venezuela ahead of a House vote on Wednesday. Kevin Whitaker (pictured) is the U.S. ambassador for Colombia . The bill instructs the Obama administration to compile a list of human rights abusers in the Venezuelan government, freeze their assets and ban them from the United States. Foreign relations committees in the House and Senate have overwhelmingly approved it. Administration officials are opposed. They say sanctions risk undermining mediation efforts in Venezuela and straining relations between the U.S. and Latin American partners. The Democrats led by Michigan Rep. John Conyers wrote a letter to President Barack Obama on Tuesday backing his administration. They also urged an exchange of ambassadors with Venezuela after a four-year hiatus. Violent unrest has gripped Venezuela for months. Forty-two people have been killed since February. In Caracas, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro welcomed the Democratic lawmakers' initiative, saying he hopes 'there is a bit of wisdom' in Washington. 'Thank you for taking this initiative to try to raise awareness and stop, with the conscience of the people of the United States, stop any insolent madness,' the socialist leader said Tuesday night in his radio and television show, In Contact With Maduro. 'Any law that is approved in the United States Congress to sanction Venezuela is spurious,' he added. 'We will not recognize it.'","Venezuelan leaders presented emails allegedly showing how Kevin Whitaker offered his support to the opposition and indicated 'new steps'

"By . Snejana Farberov . and Lydia Warren . Josh Powell's two young sons suffered sexual abuse at the hands of their father before he killed them with a hatchet and blew up their Washington state home in 2012, according to a new tell-all book. Gregg Olsen and Rebecca Morris, the authors of 'If I Can’t Have You: Susan Powell, Her Mysterious Disappearance, and the Murder of Her Children,' claim that they uncovered evidence proving that John and Susan Powell’s children, 7-year-old Charlie and 5-year-old Braden, were molested while living with their father and paternal grandfather. The boys’ maternal grandparents, Chuck and Judy Cox, first noticed that something was amiss with their grandkids when Charlie and Braden moved into their Utah home in 2011, two years after their mother's disappearance. Inappropriate behavior: Chuck and Judy Cox, (pictured) noticed that their grandsons, Charlie (left) and Braden (right), refused to sleep clothed, telling them their father, Josh Powell, used to sleep naked with them . The book, based on interviews with the couple’s family and friends, claims that one night, the siblings refused to put on their pajamas while getting ready for bed, according to Radar Online. 'Who told you it’s okay to be naked?' Mr Cox asked the boys, to which they allegedly replied, 'Our daddy!' After talking to Charlie, the grandfather learned that he and his brother slept naked in bed with John Powell, who also slept in the nude. One of the brothers later drew a picture for Chuck Cox showing what appears to be a child next to an adult, accompanied by the chilling words, 'Don’t play with me!' The book, which is out in stores today, . suggests that there is also a possibility that Braden was molested by Josh's father, Steve, who was later charged . with voyeurism for taking pictures of young girls who lived next door . to him. When the boys were taken from the custody of their father, Braden was diagnosed with a fungal skin . infection; one way to contract this infection is through sexual contact, the authors said. Charlie and Braden's maternal grandparents also noted that the kids started getting violent with one another. Where is she? Susan Powell, pictured with her sons Braden and Charlie, vanished in 2009 and in the months ahead of her disappearance, her husband might have been poisoning her, friends have said . One night when the two were taking a bath together, Mr Cox walked in on Charlie holding his brother's head underwater. The man later recalled that a few more seconds and the toddler likely would have suffocated. Olson . and Morris' book contains other disturbing allegations surrounding the . Powell family drama, including claims that the father starved Charlie to . the point of malnutrition and possibly poisoned his wife, Susan, before . she vanished in 2009. While . 29-year-old Susan Powell's body has never been found, her husband was . long suspected of having a role in her disappearance. Then in February . 2012, he attacked his sons with a hatchet and blew them - and himself - . up in his Washington state home. Speaking to authors Olsen and Morris for their book, 'If I Can't Have You', the couple's friends have given a terrifying insight into the Powell household. They claim that Josh Powell, who was unemployed, controlled the family's finances - ordering his broker wife only to buy the cheapest groceries and refusing to feed the children three meals a day. 'Susan had to research what was on sale at what store,' Michele Oreno told the authors. 'Then she had to come home and put it into the computer, what she spent on every item. Troubled: Her husband, Josh Powell, pictured, also withheld food from his young sons, friends said . Tragic: He killed himself and his sons in 2012 by striking them with a hatchet and blowing up the house . '[Josh] was . really ticked off because the week before she had spent two cents more . on a can of peas than he found at another store... It got so he wouldn’t . give her money for food or anything.' Susan even called friends to ask if she could sneak hot dogs from them because the boys were so hungry, friends said. Then, when Charlie Powell was a year old, a doctor diagnosed him with malnutrition, the book said. 'He gets one meal a day at day care. That's all he needs,' Josh told Susan, according to friend Rachel Marini. 'You’re not wasting my food on him because he’s just going to poop it out!' Friends added that they started to suspect him of poisoning his wife in October 2009, two months before she vanished. She began to feel nauseous so wondered if she was pregnant before miscarrying, friends said. 'He made a . lot of organic products for her to drink, a lot of thick yogurt stuff . and fermented drinks with kefir,' friend Amber Hardman explained. What did he know? Powell, pictured after his wife vanished, reportedly ordered his wife around in their home . Theories: The new insights were shared by friends in a book out Tuesday, left. It also suggests that one of the sons may have been sexually assaulted by Josh's father Steve, pictured in court, right . Susan's body was never found, although the search still continues. Josh has claimed that his wife was at home when he took his sons, Charlie and Braden, on a winter camping trip in Utah's West Desert.

"By . David Mccormack . NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden has hit back at claims made by the Obama administration that he was merely a low-level hacker and has claimed that he worked undercover for both the CIA and the National Security Agency. ‘I was trained as a spy in sort of the traditional sense of the word, in that I lived and worked undercover overseas - pretending to work in a job that I'm not - and even being assigned a name that was not mine,’ he told NBC News in his first interview with a U.S. TV network. Snowden, who was granted temporary asylum in Russia after revealing details of U.S. spying activities to journalists, portrayed himself as ‘a technical specialist... a technical expert.’ Scroll down for video . In his first ever interview with a U.S. TV network, the Moscow-based NSA whistlebower said many of the terms used by the Obama administration to describe him were 'misleading' ‘I don't work with people. I don't recruit agents. What I do is I put systems to work for the United States. And I've done that at all levels from - from the bottom on the ground all the way to the top,’ he told NBC’s Brian Williams. Last year, when Snowden began leaking details of NSA spying programs and left the country, administration officials played down his work history, using descriptions such as 'systems administrator' to describe his role at the agency. In June, President Obama told reporters: 'No, I’m not going to be scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker.' Snowden told Williams that those terms were 'misleading.' Snowden told NBC's Brian Williams that he had been trained as a spy and had worked undercover for both the CIA and the National Security Agency . In the Defense Intelligence Agency job, Snowden said, he 'developed sources and methods for keeping our information and people secure in the most hostile and dangerous environments around the world.' 'So when they say I’m a low-level systems administrator, that I don’t know what I’m talking about, I’d say it’s somewhat misleading,' he said. After leaving the government, Snowden continued his intelligence work for the NSA as a private contractor, including stints in Japan and Hawaii. While in the Aloha State he downloaded an estimated 1.7 million files before fleeing first to Hong Kong and then to Moscow. He has been charged with espionage and had his U.S. passport revoked. Back in the limelight: NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden will appear in his first interview with mainstream American TV this week . Snowdon was interviewed in Moscow last week. An hour-long special will air on Wednesday at 10 p.m. ET. The exclusive interview is the latest media appearance by Snowden, following a videolink speech at the South by Southwest Interactive Festival, a TED Conference in March and an interview in Vanity Fair's May issue. Also appearing on the NBC special is Glenn Greenwald, the Pulitzer prize winning journalist who broke the NSA surveillance story in the Guardian. Snowden’s interview comes after the House moved the U.S. closer to ending the NSA's bulk collection of Americans' phone records last Thursday. It is the most significant demonstration to date of Snowden's impact on the debate over privacy versus security. But the final version of the legislation, ‘watered down’ in the words of one supporter, also showed the limits of that impact. Interview: NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams travelled to Moscow, Russia, where Mr Snowden holds temporary asylum since last year, and spent several hours quizzing him . Exclusive: The hour long interview is set to air on Wednesday night, and may give a further insight into Snowden's future plans . The bill was severely weakened to mollify U.S. intelligence agencies, which insisted that the surveillance programs that shocked many Americans are a critical bulwark against terror plots. The bill was approved 303-121, which means that most House members can now say they voted to end what many critics consider the most troubling practice Snowden disclosed — the collection and storage of U.S. calling data by the secretive intelligence agency. But almost no other major provision designed to restrict NSA surveillance, including limits on the secret court that grants warrants to search the data, survived the negotiations to get the bill to the House floor. And even the prohibition on bulk collection of Americans' communications records has been called into question by some activists who say a last-minute change in wording diminished what was sold as a ban. ‘People will say, “We did something, and isn't something enough”,‘ said Steven Aftergood, who tracks intelligence issues for the Federation of American Scientists. ‘But this bill doesn't fundamentally resolve the uncertainties that generated the whole controversy.’ Though some privacy activists continued to back the bill, others withdrew support, as did technology companies such as Google and Facebook.","In his first ever interview with a U.S. TV network, the NSA whistlebower said many of the terms used to describe him were 'misleading'

China's super-rich are paying thousands of dollars a month for human breast milk, with some adults even choosing to be wet nursed.

According to the Southern Metropolis Daily, domestic staff agencies are offering wet nurses for newborns, sick people or anyone who will pay up to 16,000 yuan (£2,600) a month. Customers say they want the concentrated nutrition breast milk provides. It has a unique combination of antibodies, living cells, enzymes, hormones and fatty acids that has led some people to treat it as the latest superfood. 'Adult (clients) can drink it . directly through breastfeeding, or they can always drink it from a . breast pump if they feel embarrassed', Lin Jun, owner of company . Xinxinyu that offers the service, was quoted as saying by AFP. Critics say the practice turns a mother's milk into a commodity and cheapens the bond between mother and child.

"By . Associated Press . Firefighters swarmed to the Central California foothills in Fresno on Tuesday, attacking a blaze that had grown to 1,300 acres in two days. Officials urged some residents east of Lake McClure in Mariposa County to leave their homes, as fire crews work to tamp down the flames before they grow too large to handle. In an extreme dry year like this, state fire spokesman Daniel Berlant said, they are attacking it from all angles . SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The California blaze grew to 1,300 acres over two days (pictured) Firefighters swarmed to the Central California foothills in Fresno on Tuesday (pictured trying to battle the blaze) 'We're fighting this fire not only on the ground but also in the air, helping to slow this thing down,' Berlant said. The Hunters Fire ignited on Monday afternoon and destroyed three buildings as it spread to the dry brush in steep foothills. Crews had difficulty reaching it, and on Tuesday temperatures rose into the 90s with winds up to 20 mph, adding to the challenge of an already dry year. More than 670 firefighters on the ground had the fire 20 percent contained, Berlant said. The cause remained under investigation. In its third dry year, California has already had 1,700 wildfires in 2014, said Berlant, who compared that with the 900 by this time last year. 'The drought has let fires like this burn at a much more intense and active rate than we would typically see,' he said. The fire has caused five injuries. One of them was an inmate firefighter who was cut by a chain saw, said Berlant, describing the injury as moderate. He said the other four firefighters suffered minor injuries. Up to 100 homes are potentially threatened, but the Mariposa County Sheriff's Office notified about 50 residents in immediate danger, urging them to evacuate. Residents were called by phone and then deputies knocked on doors, said Kristie Mitchell, a department spokeswoman. Mitchell said she didn't know how many left their homes. 'If they want to leave or not, that is up to them,' she said. Local residents were told to leave as firefighters struggle to contain the fire . Meanwhile, a fire in northern Arizona that ignited May 20 around Oak Creek Canyon continued to grow in size even though firefighters had established a containment line around all it. The so-called Slide Fire between Flagstaff and Sedona increased in size to 32 square miles Tuesday. Firefighters spotted a small and possibly historic cabin while conducting a burnout operation on a steep side in the area of Oak Creek Canyon. The crew removed debris from around the cabin and placed a layer of protective fabric around it. Investigators have begun trying to determine what sparked the fire. Brady Smith of the Coconino National Forest said they have received about 80 tips, but the investigation could take months. 'It really depends on the types of tips that we get in and the information we're able to gather right off the bat,' Smith said. 'Some fires go unsolved forever.'","Officials urges Fresno residents to leave their homes as the fire grows .

The massive twister injured nine people, severely damaged . 15 trailers and ruined equipment at the Bakken Oilfield, about . five miles outside the city. Scroll down for videos . The video by Dan Yorgason shows a tornado in a worker's camp near Watford City, North Dakota, in the heart of the state's booming oil patch . The pair flee to their pickup truck, but keep the camera rolling as the twister continues on its path of destruction . As . the tornado approaches in the distance, alarms begin to sound in the trailer park and Yorgason shouts: 'It's about to go right over us.' He adds: 'We've got nowhere to go. It's heading right for us. I don't want to be sitting here.' One of the pair then grab the keys to their pickup truck so they can take refuge in the front seats. Sat in the cabin, they watch as the tornado carries on its path of destruction alongside the vehicle. 'I don't know where it's going': The vortex appears to stop as the pair are in the cabin of the vehicle . With the windows to the vehicle open, they start shouting: 'Look at everybody just running.' The vortex then appears to stop next to the vehicle and the pair say: 'It's just sitting there. 'I can't tell which way it's going. It looks like it's breaking apart.' Baseball-sized hail fell during the storm and the tornado was on the ground for an entire minute, witnesses said. Cloud: Dirt and debris flies across the caravan park as the tornado sweeps through the area . A woman who captured another video of . the vortex can be heard repeatedly praying and saying 'we've got nowhere . to go' as a man in the background kept shouting to people that a . tornado was coming. The desperation and panic in her voice is haunting. One . witness posted to Facebook that the twister started on a Hess oil . field, but MailOnline was not able to independently confirm. Massive: The tornado stuck the Bakken Oilfield, about five miles outside of Watford City, North Dakota . From afar: A picture taken a few miles from the dangerous storm shows how large it was . The critically injured person is currently being treated in a local hospital, officials said. The other eight were treated and released. An initial report by KXMB suggested a trailer with four children in it had gone missing, but all people were later accounted for, officials said.

Bunkel, 38, took photos of the twister and estimated that it remained on the ground for nearly a minute. He said he couldn't see any debris. 'It was a little bit too far away. We just saw the clouds and the rotation,' he said. The tornado warning for the area . was later lifted, but McKenzie County emergency management officials were . asking people to stay off the roads because emergency vehicles were . having a difficult time reaching the scene.

Cracked: This windshield was all but smashed in by the giant hail . Many live in hastily-assembled trailer parks or man camps, which contain pre-fabricated structures that can resemble military barracks. Some companies rent blocks of hotel rooms for employees to live in, and some workers sleep in their cars or even tents. Housing developments are constantly popping up in big areas of town that didn't exist on maps a couple of years ago. But they are still not enough to keep pace with demand and oil money has pushed rents to among the highest in the nation, even rivaling trendy neighborhoods in the country's largest cities. A simple one bedroom apartment in the oil boom hub city of Williston can easily cost $2,000 per month in rent. Even a spot to park a trailer can cost over $800 per month.

Amateur inventor He Liangcai has created an electric suitcase, which not only transports your belongings, but allows the owner to sit on it and travel along at up to 12 mph. The reinforced suitcase, which weighs 15 pounds, comes with a small battery and is able to carry two adults for a distance of up to 37 miles on a full charge. He Liangcai demonstrates how to use one of the electric-motored suitcases he designed in Changsha, China . It even has GPS navigation and a burglar alarm. The piece of luggage consists of an electric scooter, which has a suitcase attached to it. The rider sits on top of the suitcase to reach over to the handlebars where the throttle, brakes and lights can be found. Mr He demonstrated how the baggage worked . by riding on one of his suitcases from his home to Changsha train . station in China's central Hunan Province, around seven miles away. Two security guards try out Mr He's ride-on suitcase, which can accommodate two adults . The suitcase has a top speed of 12 mph and can travel up to 37 miles when it has been fully charged . According to the Global Times, it took the inventor 10 years to develop the scooter, despite the fact he is a farmer by trade with little formal education. In 1999, he designed a car safety system, which earned him an award in the U.S. And when he forgot his luggage when travelling to America to collect the accolade, he came up with the idea for the suitcase.","He Liangcai invents a ride-on electric suitcase which can go at up to 12mph .

"By . Richard Spillett . London could have the highest levels of cocaine use of any city in Europe, a new report suggests. Researchers tested the amount of a number of illegal substances in the waste water of cities across the continent in a bid to assess Europe's drug habits. They found London had the highest levels of cocaine of any of the 42 cities tested, well above that of other capitals including Amsterdam and Paris. London's sewage water contained 711mg of benzoylecgonine, the main chemical in cocaine, per 1,000 people, compared to 393 in Amsterdam, 243 in Paris and 233 in Milan. Levels in London's water were nearly double those recorded in a similar study two years ago, results show. The study, by the Lisbon-based European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Addiction, also highlighted an apparent East-West divide in drugs used. While the populations of cities in . Western Europe were more likely to cocaine, ecstasy and cannabis, . Eastern European citizens are more likely to be developing a crystal . meth habit. The research shows how levels of drugs in waste water rise and fall over the week. In London, the amount of cocaine in the water increases to 904mg on Saturday, compared to a 799mg average on weekdays. The amount of crystal meth in the capital's water trebles on a Saturday and levels of ecstasy jump from 27mg per 1,000 people on a weekday to 69mg on a Saturday. Prague had the highest levels of crystal meth in its water, at 327mg per 1,000 people, the Czech city of Budweis the second highest and Bratislava in Slovakia the third highest. Cannabis appears to be the drug of choice in France and southern Europe, with the highest levels recorded in Paris, Barcelona and Athens. UK government statistics state that around one in 12 adults used illegal drugs in 2012, but only one in 50 took Class A drugs like cocaine. Following the publication of the research, Marcus Roberts, chief executive of charity DrugScope, warned cocaine users about its dangers. Mr Roberts said: . 'While government data shows that powder cocaine use been falling since . 2008/09, it remains the second most commonly used illicit substance in . the UK. A new study of water across Europe suggests London has the highest cocaine use of any of the cities tested . 'But . it is a harmful drug and users should be aware of the risks. Cocaine is . a powerful stimulant which may place strain on the heart. 'When . taken in large doses, people can experience extreme anxiety, paranoia . and hallucinations and regular use can lead to dependence.' But London's worrying position as the . continent's cocaine capital was today played down by the Home Office, . which criticised the new research. Crime Prevention Minister Norman Baker has played down the research, insisting drug use in Britain is falling . Crime Prevention Minister Norman Baker said: 'Waste water analysis is an emerging and as such unproven technique for measuring the prevalence of drugs. 'Studies in the UK, including figures from the independent Crime Survey for England and Wales, show that drug usage remains at its lowest level since records began in 1996. 'We will however continue to review new ideas and techniques as they are developed to ensure the UK has robust systems in place to measure and track drug prevalence.' The report's authors have defended the research, stating: 'Waste water analysis provides the possibility to collect and report measurements more quickly and regularly than is the current norm for national surveys. 'If used more routinely as a complement to other European drug surveillance methods, it has the clear potential to shed extra light on drug use trends in Europe, including the use of new psychoactive substances.' Some experts have suggested the methods can actually be more accurate than studies based on questionnaires because those answering surveys are not always honest.","New study finds UK capital has highest amounts of cocaine in waste water .

"By . Lydia Warren . Text messages detailed in court documents have revealed the bitter custody battle that is still waging between Bristol Palin and her son's father, Levi Johnston. The messages were shared with an Alaska court as . Johnston tried to stop Palin traveling out the state, claiming he . never gave his permission and demanding she stop doing 'whatever . she wants'. Johnston, now 24, and Palin, 23, had son Tripp as teens just after former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin missed out on her bid for the vice presidency. They split in 2009, when he was just months old. Johnston has since married and has a one-year-old daughter named Breeze with his new wife, Sunny Oglesby - and in court documents, Johnston claims Tripp would much rather live with this family. Battle: Bristol Palin and Levi Johnston are still fighting over custody of son Tripp, pictured together in 2010 . 'Go ahead and ask him if he want to stay . with dad or go with u,' he said in the messages, shared by RadarOnline. 'Bet he says dad. Just saying . Bristol. Tripps old enough to tell u what he wants now.' The former couple had reached a child custody stipulation in August 2010, allowing Johnston to see his son on Saturdays and Wednesdays, but the court never approved it. More recently, last October, Johnston opened a new custody case when Palin moved to Scottsdale, Arizona for a six-month training program - taking Tripp with her. He served Palin with a temporary restraining order prohibiting her from taking Tripp out of the state again without the court's permission, Radar reported. She was already in Arizona, so he filed a motion for the immediate return of his son. But her lawyers claim he was happy with the plans. Together: Johnston has now married Sunny Oglesby, left, and has told Palin that their five-year-old son would rather stay with them. He also has a one-year-old daughter with Sunny . Hands on: Johnston, pictured with his kids, has admitted that he still owes Palin $30,000 in child support . 'Levi had been informed of these plans . and had not objected,' documents read. 'Bristol . returned to Alaska for her school break in December and Levi had . Christmas visitation with Tripp.' But text . messages in court documents show that Johnston was never happy about the . move. In one, he responds to a text sent by Palin before they board the . plane. Levi Johnston's text to Bristol Palin . 'When does my son get back?' Johnston responds. 'I told u … There is not chance you are taking him there for another 3 months. TRIPP wants and needs his father, Bristol... 'I no [sic] u trust our sons safe with me and is taken care of so I don’t understand why u don’t like him with his father If u only new the things he says to me and how happy he is with his dad and little sister. He really needs us both and I need him Bristol.' Bristol responded, referring to his new wife. 'Look . Levi, bfeore [sic] sunny got involved in this, you were fine with me . being in school,' Palin replies. 'Tripp is enrolled in school in AZ and . will be back when I’m done with training.' With mom: Tripp is pictured with his mother, who recently took her to Arizona - which angered Johnston . Having fun: Johnston called Palin, pictured with Tripp, 'selfish' and said she just did what suited her . He responds: 'How can u be so selfish and no I was never EVER ok with u taking my son anywhere or put on your TV show. It’s all crap. He deserves more then [sic] that. 'He needs his dad and my family just as much as yours. And more importantly. Tripp needs stability and a routine and sports. And all that. I really hope and pray u put 2 and 2 together one day. It’s not right. Or fair to our son.' She and Tripp have now returned to Alaska. Palin has previously claimed that Johnston owes her $66,8080.57 in child support, but Johnston says it's $30,000 less than that. A judge had previously denied Johnston's petition for equal custody in October, but a new judge will now take over and the first hearing will take place in July. Bristol and . Johnston's son Tripp Easton Mitchell Johnston was born in December . 2008, but the two broke off their engagement the following March. Not happy: Former Alaska governor Sarah Palin, pictured in March, had asked the couple to keep the child secret when she was running for vice president in 2008, according to Johnston . After their break-up, Johnston became outspoken against the Palin family, saying in a September 2009 Vanity Fair article that Sarah initially wanted to keep Bristol's pregnancy a secret. Johnston said Sarah offered to adopt and raise their child as her own, but that they declined. In response, Sarah issued a statement saying Johnston's statements were 'untrue, malicious, and appalling'. The young couple briefly reunited in July 2010, with Johnston issuing a public apology to the Palin family for statements he made that 'were not completely' true. But the couple broke off their second engagement just three weeks later, and Johnston said he regretted making the public apology to the Palin family. He said the statement 'kind of makes me sound like a liar. I've never lied about anything'.","Bristol Palin, 23, and her former boyfriend Levi Johnston 24, had son Tripp in December 2008 but split up months after .

"By . Damian Spellman, Press Association . Sunderland have issued a 'hands-off' warning to Southampton as the Saints start the search for a new manager. Mauricio Pochettino’s departure from the St Mary’s Stadium for Tottenham, which was confirmed on Tuesday evening, prompted a whirlwind of speculation over who is to succeed him, and Poyet’s name was among those in the mix. Murat Yakin and Ronald Koeman were being quoted as the bookmakers’ favourites, but Poyet’s odds were slashed overnight. Safe pair of hands: Gus Poyet kept Sunderland in the Premier League when relegation looked certain . However, it is understood the Wearside club will resist any attempt to lure the 46-year-old Uruguayan back to the South Coast, where he enjoyed a successful spell with Brighton before an acrimonious departure and his subsequent move to Sunderland, who he guided to Barclays Premier League safety. Murat Yakin 7/2Ronald Koeman 4/1Michael Laudrup 9/2Steve McClaren 7/1Gus Poyet 7/1Neil Lennon 10/1Eddie Howe 12/1Oscar Garcia 12/1 . *Odds provided by Coral . Poyet’s stock has risen markedly in recent months after he replaced Paolo Di Canio at the Stadium of Light with the club having collected just a single point from its first seven games prior to his arrival. Remarkably he took them to the Capital One Cup final, where they were eventually beaten by Manchester City after taking a shock lead. However, the Black Cats looked destined to return to the Football League when they found themselves seven points adrift at the foot of the table with just six games left to play, only to mount a remarkable fightback which saw them take seven points from trips to City, Chelsea and Manchester United on the way to a 14th-placed finish. Dutch master: Ronald Koeman is among the candidates to replace Mauricio Pochettino at Southampton . Contender: Basel coach Murat Yakin is another name mentioned in contention for the Southampton job . After the turmoil of the Di Canio era, Poyet’s approach has provided a breath of fresh air, although there remains an element of uncertainty over his future. There was disquiet in the boardroom over his assertion that the perennial fight for survival might suggest that there was something wrong within the club beyond the powers of successive managers, and as he celebrated what he referred to as 'the greatest escape', his future remained the main topic for debate. Speaking after a final day defeat by Swansea, Poyet said: 'Now I will have a meeting with the chairman because it’s natural, natural because yes, I want to know where we are going, if it’s possible not to make the same mistakes that we have made in the last couple of years because I don’t wasn’t to go through another year like this one. 'It’s natural, it’s natural. There are teams who start the season and the aim is to stay up, so 12th to 17th. 'Are we that team? I don’t know. Or are we goig to go for the top 10 in a better way?' Content: Sunderland owner Ellis Short is believed to want to keep Gus Poyet at the club following his good work . At the same time, Poyet, who expressed his admiration for the Saints last season, insisted he expected still to be in charge at the start of the new campaign, and he and director of football Lee Congerton are busily working on their transfer targets as they attempt to avoid the mistakes made 12 months ago. It is understood there is little appetite for change either within the hierarchy and that owner Ellis Short is prepared to fight to hang on to a head coach who is understandably hugely popular with the fans. Despite the speculation, it was business as usual for Poyet and Congerton on Wednesday as they completed their first summer signing by landing out-of-contract West Brom defender Billy Jones on a four-year-deal. Significantly, the 27-year-old, who will formally join the club on July 1, is British and has top-flight experience in this country, combined attributes none of last summer’s 14 signings could boast.

"By . Emma Glanfield . Maxine Carr, now 34, enjoyed a relaxing honeymoon at a family-friendly resort days after marrying her 'besotted' boyfriend . Maxine Carr enjoyed a relaxing honeymoon at a bustling ‘family-friendly’ resort just days after marrying her ‘besotted’ boyfriend, it has emerged. Carr, 37, who now lives under a new identity thanks to a lifelong anonymity order, is said to have spent time talking and joking with other parents and children during her holiday. It comes following a private wedding ceremony attended by both families of the pair during which guests toasted the marriage with a three-course banquet and sparkling wine. The former girlfriend of Soham murderer Ian Huntley married her current boyfriend in front of a registrar before celebrating the wedding with friends and family at a hotel. Carr, who served 21 months in jail for providing killer Ian Huntley with a false alibi after he murdered Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, both ten, in 2002, wore a £2,000 ivory dress for her big day. The former teaching assistant was given away at the ceremony by her 71-year-old mother. Her new husband is said to be ‘absolutely besotted’ with her despite knowing about her shameful past and the pair relished in posing for photographs on the hotel’s patio at their wedding reception. Following the ceremony, the newlyweds departed for their honeymoon at a family-friendly resort, although it is not known whether they travelled abroad or remained in the UK for the romantic break. Due to her lifelong anonymity order, Carr assumes a completely new identity and is said to have changed her appearance so she is not easily recognisable. However, one source said families would be ‘horrified’ to know it was her they were joking around with during her honeymoon. A source told The Sun: ‘They’d be horrified to know they could have been within yards of one of the most hated women in Britain.’ Carr was the girlfriend of school caretaker Huntley when he was arrested soon after the bodies of schoolgirls Holly and Jessica were found in August 2002. They had been missing from their homes in Soham, Cambridgeshire, for 13 days. Scroll down for video . Schoolgirls Holly Wells (left) and best friend, Jessica Chapman (right), both ten, went missing in August 2002 . Maxine Carr being interviewed by the police in August 2002. During this interview Carr told police Holly Wells was the type of girl she would like as a daughter. Huntley eventually admitted that the girls had died in his house after he had invited them in, but said their deaths were accidental. He had told them that Carr was in the house, but she had actually gone to Grimsby to visit relatives. Although Carr was not implicated in the murder, she gave Huntley a false alibi, claiming that she had been with him at the time of the killings, which delayed the police investigation. In fact she was at a nightclub in Grimsby with another man. She was originally jailed for three-and-a-half years for perverting the course of justice by covering for Huntley but only served half of her sentence. She was given anonymity for life on her release in 2004. Maxine Carr (left) served 21 months in jail for providing child killer Ian Huntley (right) with a false alibi after he murdered schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman in Soham, Cambridgeshire, in August 2002 . It means details of her honeymoon, wedding or new partner cannot be published because it could lead to her identification. She is just one of four former UK prisoners to be given secret identities, along with child killer Mary Bell and James Bulger’s murderers Robert Thompson and Jon Venables. Police protection and a new identity for Carr are thought to have cost the taxpayer millions. Huntley, now 40, was found guilty of murdering the girls following a seven-week trial at the Old Bailey, and is now serving a double life sentence in prison.","Carr enjoyed holiday at family-friendly resort days after marrying boyfriend .

"By . Mark Duell . and Ben Spencer . You may have been hoping for a flaming June but, if the forecasts are correct, it is going to be a washout in Britain. And as a foretaste, torrential rain is expected today to bring flash flooding, with some parts of Norfolk experiencing 36 hours of non-stop rain. The highest rainfall amount anywhere in Britain today since midnight this morning to 4pm this afternoon was at Bridlington, which has had 18.4mm (0.7in). Some places could get more than an inch of rain in 24 hours - and 22 flood alerts were out in the Midlands, East Anglia and, North East and South East. One more serious flood warning was also put in the place by the Environment Agency for the North Sea coast at Bridlington in East Yorkshire. Scroll down for video .

Soaking wet: Torrential rain is expected today to bring flash flooding, with some parts of Norfolk experiencing 36 hours of non-stop rain . The plans of families across the country for barbecues, garden parties, fetes and festivals may have to be revised – in some cases, rather hastily. The heaviest rain was expected in Lincolnshire, North Yorkshire and along the east coast, where some parts could see a fortnight’s worth in a few hours. The Met Office issued a yellow warning . - a moderate risk of severe weather – for Yorkshire and warned of . travel chaos amid ‘heavy and persistent’ rain. Officials . warned households to ‘be prepared’ for possible flooding. Its alerts . included several for villages along rivers in the Home Counties. They . said: ‘There may be some flooding of low-lying land and roads, some . disruption to travel and possibly flooding to individual properties.’ Some . parts of Norfolk experienced 36 hours of non-stop rain, with the fire . service called to more than 25 flooding-related incidents in Norwich. One . car became stuck when a drain cover was raised by floodwater in sewers, . while residents had to put out towels because of a lack of sandbags. Stacey .

Forecast: The plans of families across the country for summer barbecues, garden parties, fetes and festivals may have to be revised . Looking ahead: Showers are predicted for the rest of the week, with drier weather towards the weekend . The wet weather is due to a depression blowing in from the Continent. Sean . Penston, from weather forecasters MeteoGroup, said: ‘There will be a . moderate amount of rainfall, and given that we have seen a fair amount . of rain in the past few days, with the high water table there is a . chance of water developing on the surface.’ The . Environment Agency’s £5million dredging scheme on the Somerset Levels . is so far behind schedule that only 5 per cent of the area has been . completed, it was claimed today. The . dredging began on March 28 but has removed only 13,050 cubic metres . (460,000 cubic ft) of material so far - behind the target of 235,000 . cubic metres (8.3million cubic ft). The . Somerset Levels could now be at risk of flooding again - just months . after the area experienced the worst flooding in 250 years. The dredging must be finished by October before winter rain and high tides are forecast to return, reported the Western Daily Press. A . Flooded Levels Action Group spokesman said it was ‘increasingly . concerned’ about the progress, adding: ‘So far it has been slow’. But Paul Gainey of the Environment Agency said it was on course to meet the deadline. He . added: ‘The system affecting us now will weaken over the next 36 hours. There will be a largely dry day on Friday for northern parts of the UK. In the south there is a risk of further showers but drier conditions . will develop here on Saturday. ‘Even . though it is quite miserable it is quite warm outside and muggy, and . today there will be highs of 16C to 18C (61F to 64F) across south-east . England away from the coasts. ‘Tomorrow onwards we are looking at a general warming trend, with 19C (66F) across south-east England. ‘But . over the weekend we could see 21C to 22C (70F to 72F) across the South . East and a predominantly dry day on Saturday. I wouldn't rule out rain . or showers, but they won't be particularly heavy. ‘Sunday . will be generally the same, though there will be the chance of the odd . shower in south-eastern parts of England and the far north will see some . rain.’ Next week will see . rain moving in from the west on Monday and more showers over the . following days. Mr Penston said: ‘Generally there will be rain and . showers next week but less amount of cloud, so it won't be as . miserable.’ There is little consolation in the Met Office UK outlook for June 2 to June 9, updated yesterday. It . warned: ‘The weather is likely to stay changeable with showers or . longer spells of rain accompanied by breezy conditions at times, . particularly across western areas at first.’ The . outlook for June 10 to 24 is hardly any more encouraging: ‘Changeable . weather looks more likely than not to persist into mid-June. ‘As . such, conditions would then be mixed with showers or longer spells of . rain, particularly for western areas, interspersed by some drier, . brighter periods for most parts of the UK.’ Showers . are predicted for the rest of the week, with drier weather towards the . weekend - but there is no sign of hot weather similar to earlier this . month.

The average rainfall for May is around 50mm (2in) but the North was told it can expect up to 40mm (1.6in) of rainfall yesterday and today alone. Meanwhile, a behaviour expert has claimed people only feel sad in bad weather because they think about it too much, reported the Daily Telegraph. Paul Dolan said that because people in Britain talk about the weather so much, it may be making us more depressed than the conditions outside. The London School of Economics professor claimed studies had shown people who live in warmer climates are not happier than those in wetter areas. He said: ‘Most of the time the weather doesn’t affect out wellbeing at all. But when we think about it, and think that it does, that’s when we get miserable.'

Elsewhere it will stay cloudy, although some limited . brighter spells are possible, but also isolated showers. Outlook for tomorrow to Saturday: It . will slowly turn drier and brighter during Thursday with rain . continuing to ease. Bright or sunny spells and variable cloud follows on . Friday and Saturday, but also isolated showers . UK outlook for May 31 to June 9: Largely . cloudy but mainly dry conditions are expected through Saturday although . a few showers may develop across western areas. Through Sunday, more . persistent rain across western areas is likely to push east through the . day, with sunshine and showers following. The rain may well turn heavy . for a time as it moves eastwards. Whilst temperatures will be near . normal, it will feel cool with the rain. The weather is likely to stay . changeable thereafter with showers or longer spells of rain accompanied . by breezy conditions at times, particularly across western areas at . first. Despite this, there will be some warmer, drier and sunnier spells . but with the risk of some chilly nights for the time of year.

As such, . conditions would then be mixed with showers or longer spells of rain, . particularly for western areas, interspersed by some drier, brighter . periods for most parts of the UK. Later in the month, there are signs . beginning to emerge of a change towards more settled conditions, at . least for the north of the UK.

"By . Belinda Robinson . Sad death: Pensioner Rita Phelps died after falling out of her hospital bed and suffering a fatal head injury at Southampton General Hospital . An elderly cancer patient died when she fell out of a hospital bed after staff failed to raise one of her bedside safety rails, an inquest heard. Rita Phelps, 74, suffered a fatal head injury when she fell to the floor during the night in an intensive care unit. Staff at Southampton General Hospital had failed to raise one of her bedside safety rails which would have acted as a barrier to protect her. As a result, Mrs Phelps rolled out of her bed, hit her head and died just hours later following a bleed on her brain. Her . two daughters attended the inquest at Southampton Coroner’s Court and . said their mother, would 'still be alive' if the nurse had 'raised the bed . rail'. Gordon Denson, deputy coroner for Southampton and the New Forest, told the inquest her 'sad and untimely' death was preventable. He said: 'I am, to say the least, concerned that the level of care expected was below the standard required. 'Such a fundamental error should never have occurred.' At the inquest, a family statement said other NHS staff had . originally misdiagnosed her illness as osteoporosis and a chest . infection. Mrs . Phelps, a retired widow, then moved from Hythe in Hampshire to Hove, East Sussex, where . doctors found she was suffering from a type of blood cancer called . multiple myeloma. She made good progress and moved to Totton near Southampton, Hampshire. But last year she noticed a pea-sized lump on her head was growing rapidly and was told her cancer had returned. She was rushed to Southampton General Hospital and transferred to the intensive care unit. Last year on June 20, her family received a telephone call at 5am from staff saying their mother had fallen out of her bed during the night. Failure: Staff failed to raise one of her bedside safety rails an inquest heard, which would have acted as a barrier to protect her from falling out of the bed in the middle of the night . A family statement said: 'Staff apologised and said it should never have happened. 'We asked if the sides of the bed were up and we were told no one could remember.' Coroner Mr Denson then read a statement from staff nurse Camilla Fox, who said the rails on the right-hand side of the bed were down. Ms Fox said: 'I heard a noise and found the patient on the floor. I shouted for help and supported her on the floor. 'I asked her questions, which she answered clearly and coherently.' But she added that Mrs Phelps started to look pale and became clammy. The pensioner suffered a bleed on the brain, which was inoperable, and died just hours later. Hospital staff said an investigation was launched into the incident and steps had been taken to prevent any similar tragedies in the future. The coroner said Mrs Phelps died as a result of injuries she received in the fall and recorded a verdict of accidental death. Juliet . Pearce, patient safety manager at the University Hospital Southampton . NHS Foundation Trust released a statement after the inquest. She . said: 'We hope the information shared with family members both in . hospital and at the inquest demonstrates the Trust’s regret and concern . about this incident. 'We are also committed to minimise the risk of falls. 'We . will continue to provide Mrs Phelps’ family with our support and will . keep them informed of the improvements made to systems to prevent other . families suffering the loss of a loved one under similar circumstances.' After the hearing, her daughters Jan Oriel of Hove, East Sussex, and Teresa Harris, of Totton, Hampshire, claimed their mother had been failed by the NHS. Mrs Oriel said: 'If a nurse had raised the bed she would still be alive today. She did not have a chance to fight the cancer because that chance was taken away.'","Rita Phelps, 74, suffered a fatal head injury when she fell to the floor during the night .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Remorse: Sasha Long, 36, crashed his go cart into a crowd during a soap box derby event leaving two children in critical condition . A man who left two children fighting for their lives after crashing into them in a go gart while taking part in a soap box derby has told how he said he feels 'terrible'. Sasha Long, 36, was at the wheel of a ‘canoe-type’ homemade racer when he lost control and slammed into a crowd of spectators, injuring seven, including the two three-year-old children. The boy and girl, who were cousins, are said to have suffered serious head injuries after the accident in Warbleton, East Sussex. They remain in critical conditions in South London hospitals, according to Sussex Police. Speaking from his farmhouse home in a nearby village a visibly distressed Mr Long told of his sorrow for the injured children and adults. He said: 'I feel terrible towards the families of the injured people, especially the children who are still in critical care. 'I do not want to say anything else at the moment without first consulting the families of the children. 'I am so very tired.' Mr Long was taking part in the annual ‘Soap Box Derby’ hosted by the local Black Duck Pub, an event open to adults as well as children. Witnesses say he lost control at the first corner after going over some hay and mud, before careening into a crowd of people stood behind safety straw bale barriers. The girl, from Hailsham, East Sussex, was flown by air ambulance to King’s College Hospital in London, whiule the boy, from Herstmonceux, East Sussex, was airlifted to St Georges Hospital in South London. Mr Long received a minor knee injury and his 60-year-old mother, who was travelling on the back of the cart, is thought to have broken her hand. Around 700-1000 people had gathered . along the closed off road for the third annual race, which saw 40 people . enter with their homemade carts along the 500yd stretch of closed-off . road. Other spectators . injured included a 20-year-old woman, a four-year-old boy and a man aged . 37 who all suffered leg and arm injuries. Event: Mr Long was taking part in the annual ¿Soap Box Derby¿ hosted by the local Black Duck Pub, an event which sees adults race home-made vehicles down a nearby hill . The . terrible crash happened on the 37th run of the day, at the very end of . the first corner. After the crash, the event was immediately cancelled. Landlord Nikki Kinnell, who organised . the ‘Church Hill Challenge’ event with husband Gary for the third year . running, said they were devastated by the accident. She said: 'We’re very sorry that this accident happened. Our thoughts are with the families. 'We had been racing all day and the accident happened after 36 carts had gone down without incident. 'We had all the proper safety measures in place, marshals and huge straw bales we kept asking people to stay behind. 'It was an accident. Accidents happen, but this is a really bad one. Speaking from his farmhouse home in a nearby village, a visibly distressed Mr Long told of his sorrow for the injured children and adults . 'We’re all devastated.' A local, who witnessed the crash, said: 'It’s not like anyone was to blame really. 'You can’t blame people who got hurt, even if they may have been stood where they were told they shouldn’t. 'It certainly wasn’t the driver’s fault. 'The day was meant to be a bit of fun, nothing dangerous or risky. 'What a tragedy. I hope the little ones are pull through.' However one local slammed the organisers over the lack of safety. Valerie Patience, 72, who went to watch the race with her husband Brian, 74, queried why St John Ambulance crews were not on standby at the event. She said: 'I don't think it was properly organised for safety, someone should have been down there and said ""You can't stand right on the lane, you have to go behind the hay bales"". 'I have got grandchildren and there is no way they would have been there on that bend.' Describing the carnage of the crash she added: 'It was absolutely dreadful with the two little ones getting hurt. 'A woman, either an aunt or a mother, ran with the little girl in her arms from the bottom to the top of the hill. 'The little boy was taken up on a quad bike to the pub.' Mrs Patience said the kart track had been lined with hay bales but on the corner where the crash happened the young children were standing in front of the bales and sitting on top of them. 'We stood behind the bales for safety but on that bend they had come in front of the bales so there was no protection whatsoever,' she said. 'The kart skidded and went right into them. 'It was just terrible, after that other people were calling for first aiders in the crowd, they didn't realise how bad it was.' Sussex Police said: 'Police have . carried out initial enquiries and have spoken to the event organisers . and witnesses, and are also keeping in contact with the victims and . families involved. 'We are . also supplying information to Wealden District Council so that they can . establish the full circumstances and decide what action should be taken, . as the road was closed at the time.' Crowds: Around 700-1000 people had gathered along the closed off road for the third annual race, which saw 40 people enter with their homemade carts along the 500yd stretch of closed-off road . The terrible crash happened on the 37th run of the day, at the very end of the first corner. After the crash, the event was immediately cancelled. The . event featured 38 entrants from the local area, competing to see whose . homemade kart could travel the furthest and fastest down the hill . outside the pub, around the corner where the accident took place and up . the other side. Around 1,000 people gathered to watch . the race, which was marked out by hay bales and raised money for a . prostate cancer charity. Videos . have emerged on social media of other karters crashing into hedgerows . on the same bend, but the drivers and passengers in each case appear . unhurt. Nikki Kinnell, who . runs the Black Duck pub with her husband Gary and organised the said: . 'We are both really sad that this has happened and our thoughts are with . those injured. We have held the event for three years without any major . incidents. 'The children are in a bad way but they are improving and showing good signs, they are awake and talking to their parents.'

"By . James Tozer . A mugger who dragged a pensioner to the ground and snatched her handbag picked the wrong judge to throw insults at when he was brought before a court. Stephen Mann, 21, called Judge Andrew Hatton a ‘kn**head’ after being jailed for eight years for the cowardly attack on the 72-year-old and a knifepoint store robbery. The no-nonsense judge ordered the serial criminal to be hauled back from the cells – and silenced him by adding another six months to his sentence. Extended jail term: Stephen Mann (left), 21, was leaving the dock at Liverpool Crown Court after being sentenced for two raids when he made the outburst to Judge Andrew Hatton (right) Mann mugged the pensioner as she . walked along the street with her husband in Wigan, Greater Manchester, . last October, grabbing at her handbag as she walked past then dragging . her to the ground and snatching it from her grasp. The drifter then ran off, leaving his victim with injuries to her arm, shoulder and chest. Just . over a week later, Mann burst into R&W Gore newsagents in nearby . Hindley and threatened the owner at knifepoint and demanded cash. But . the shopkeeper refused to hand over any money and told Mann to leave, . throwing a wooden bat which hit him in the back as he fled. Hearing: The exchange occurred at Liverpool Crown Court (pictured) on Tuesday when drifter Mann was found guilty of a knifepoint robbery and burglary after a trial . Mann . was caught later after being spotted riding a bike at a high speed, and . after being pursued by officers including the force helicopter was . cornered in a nearby park. After being arrested he was seen rubbing his back and had injuries consistent with being struck by the shopkeeper. At . his trial at Liverpool Crown Court, he was convicted of two counts of . robbery as well as a domestic burglary. Judge Hatton initially imposed . sentences of seven years for the robberies – to run concurrently – plus a . further 12 months on top for the burglary. But . as Mann was being led from the dock, he branded the judge a ‘kn**head’ and was brought back to answer for his contempt, receiving an extra six . months – bringing  his total sentence to eight-and-a-half years. Afterwards Detective Sergeant Nigel Rigby of Greater Manchester Police . said: ‘Mann plagued the area, and would undoubtedly have continued had . he not been caught. ‘He is a . prolific offender and his reaction in the dock reflects the kind of . person he is and his contempt for the law. I am pleased he will not pose . a threat to our community for the foreseeable future.’ Judge Hatton, 49, has been a senior circuit judge since 2012, having been made a recorder in 2009. Educated . at £10,000-a-year Bolton School – whose Latin motto, Mutare Vel Timere . Sperno, means ‘I scorn to change or to fear’, he went on to study at . Leeds Polytechnic. The . married father-of-two lists his recreations as skiing, golf and theatre . in Who’s Who, and has been part of the EU mission to Kosovo advising on . cases of war crimes, terrorism and the illegal trade in human organs.","Stephen Mann had been sentenced at Liverpool Crown Court for two raids .

A mother said she was 'disgusted' to find a dead cockroach in her bag of Tesco Rich In Flavour spinach after she had already eaten half of the pack. Laura Platt, 27, said she vomited after finding the insect among the pre-washed vegetable leaves, and says the experience has put her off leafy greens. The beauty salon owner, from Hurstpierpoint, West Sussex, has turned down a 'good will' gesture of a £20 voucher from Tesco, which says it is investigating the incident. 'I love greens and ate half a bag of . it shortly after buying it, cooking it and mixing it into some pasta,' said Mrs Platt, who has two sons. 'I was really poorly afterwards for about two days, but I didn't know what could have caused it. 'To get myself better I thought I needed more vitamins so decided to cook the rest of the spinach. 'That's when I found the cockroach. I couldn't believe my eyes. 'I was so shocked that I went and threw up for about 20 minutes. 'It was disgusting. I haven't eaten any greens since, it's really put me off which is a shame. 'I can't imagine how it got in there as the stuff is meant to be washed. Maybe it crawled in afterwards.' Mrs Platt took photos and put the cockroach in a tub before taking it back to Tesco, where staff told her she should have gone to the doctors if she had been sick. She later followed up the complaint with a phone call to the customer services line. 'In the shop the staff said they would put it down as a formal complaint,' she said. 'When I rang, the woman said I should have gone to a doctor straight away and got a sick note. 'Because I didn't, she said I can't prove I was sick in the first place because of the cockroach. 'But I'm a busy working mum and would have had to cancel loads of clients. Discovery: Mrs Platt found the cockroach after returning to the half-eaten pack of pre-washed spinach .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Every political leader needs to be able to explain their mission in life to voters. But challenged to sum up his vision in a single word, Ed Miliband failed miserably, waffling on for 111 words which did little to shed light on his Labour plans for Britain. The episode will do little to persuade his critics – including many in his own party – that he is too wordy and academic to make a connection with the average voter. Labour leader Ed Miliband proved himself unable to sum up his leadership in a single word during a visit to Thurrock in Essex . Mr Miliband was speaking at an event in in Thurrock, Essex – a seat Labour is hoping to win back next year. But in last week’s local elections Labour lost ground, raising fears Mr Miliband’s leadership is failing to connect with the electorate with a year until the general election. After delivering a speech on immigration, Mr Miliband took questions from activists and journalists. It was put to him that he is ‘too wordy and too academic’ and challenged to give just one word which ‘defines your leadership and tells voters what makes you different’. But Mr Miliband floundered, choosing at first to give not one but two words: ‘One Nation.’ But perhaps realising that this abstract slogan, borrowed from 19th century Tory Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, Mr Miliband went on to flesh out his ideas. 'I'll give you two: One Nation. 'One Nation is an idea about how you bring every person in the country to make a contribution and show their potential. 'And that's what I'm about. 'And that's what I'm about for Britain. 'And I think it shows that Labour is a party that is reaching out to people across our country and that Labour has an answer. 'And in the end, the question is does that country succeed with people at the top doing well? 'Or does it succeed when actually ordinary people are supported? 'And that is the big question for Britain. 'And actually I believe that will be the big question for Britain at the next election.' He said the soundbite was about ‘how you bring every person in the country to make a contribution and show their potential’, adding: ‘That's what I'm about.’ He claimed that was what he was ‘about for Britain’ and said Labour is ‘reaching out to people across our country and that Labour has an answer’. Realising that no-one knew what the question was to which Labour had an answer, Mr Miliband continued: ‘In the end, the question is does that country succeed with people at the top doing well? Or does it succeed when actually ordinary people are supported? ‘And that is the big question for Britain. And actually I believe that will be the big question for Britain at the next election.’ Aides said Mr Miliband could sum up his leadership in a single word but 'chose not to'. However, the apparent inability to succinctly sum up what he stands for comes after a series of PR gaffes by the Labour leader. In the run-up to the local and European elections last week he was skewered on live TV over the cost of his weekly shopping bill. Having campaigned on the rising cost of living, accusing the government of being out of touch, he was unable to say how much he spent himself. He suggested it might be £70 or £80 a week, but was told the average for a family of four was more than £100. It later emerged he regularly shops in a smart delicatessen near his North London home where a loaf of bread costs £2.25. The next day he embarked on a tour of 10 areas to promote 10 policies, but on the first stop he was pictured make a meal of eating a bacon sandwich. After a set of embarrassing photographs were published online, the rest of the tour continued without publicity. Asked about the sandwich yesterday, Mr Miliband said: ‘Honestly, really and truly, this is not what politics is about.’ Mr Miliband said he could describe his vision as 'One Nation', but it took him a lot of words even to explain that . Instead he faced fresh pressure over Labour's response to the rise of UKIP and tackling public concern about immigration. He said: 'I am the son of immigrants. I am proud of the contribution my parents made to this country. I believe immigration benefits our country as a whole. But it needs to be properly managed. 'I have changed Labour’s position on immigration since 2010 because it is not prejudiced to worry about immigration, it is understandable. 'Labour would have controls when people arrive and leave here, we will tackle the undercutting of wages, we will ensure people in public services speak English and people need to earn their entitlements.' He said: 'These are the right principles for our immigration policy.' He added: 'Looking to the future, openness, concern for the poorest and a belief in the modern economy were not wrong. They were right. 'But it was not enough. That’s why as I have said since I became leader, there is no future for Labour saying we should simply pick up from where we left off in 2010.'","Labour leader challenged over whether he is too wordy and academic .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Risk: George Nicholls, 25, has been fined after he balanced a 20 foot ladder on top of his van to paint gutttering on a busy road, while a workmate held the ladder . A roofer has been fined £4,000 after he balanced a 20 foot ladder on top of his van to paint guttering on building next to a busy road. George Nicholls, 25, dangerously improvised when he found he could not reach the top of a shop front from the pavement in Southampton, Hampshire. He put his fully-extended ladder on top of his van and climbed eight metres above ground to paint the facade, while a workmate climbed on top of the van and stood at the foot of the ladder. However, a passerby photographed the precarious set-up and reported Nicholls, who was prosecuted by the Health and Safety Executive. A court heard that Nicholls had also parked his van over a bus stop on the busy road as he carried out the work. Magistrates in Southampton were told that either Nicholls or his labourer could have fallen, and that there was no form of segregation to stop vehicles or pedestrians from passing under or near the work area. The court also heard how a pavement licence should have been obtained to create a properly segregated safe-working area and scaffolding should have been used. Nicholls, of Newdigate, Surrey, who runs Laser Roofing London and South East Roofing Limited, admitted breaching health and safety laws and was fined £4,000 and ordered to pay a further £666 in costs. Maintenance 24-7 Ltd, of King's Lynn, Norfolk., who sub-contracted the work to Nicholls, also admitted safety breaches and was fined £10,000 with £784 costs by the same magistrates. 'The photographic evidence speaks for itself in terms of the risks created,' said HSE inspector Frank Flannery. 'Anyone can see the system of work is plain wrong, so why a supposedly competent roofer chose to work in this way is anyone's guess. 'George Nicholls blatantly and recklessly risked harming himself and others, and he did so on behalf of Maintenance 24-7 Ltd, who had clear duties of their own to ensure the work at height was properly planned, managed and executed in a safe manner. 'The standards of both parties fell far below those required, and I would like to thank the concerned member of the public who initially brought the matter to the council's attention.'

"By . Amanda Williams . Stephen Ward received more than £7,600 in disability payments after he set up home in the resort town of Deryneia . A man who said he couldn't walk more than 16 feet a minute claimed disability benefits for three years even though he’d moved to Cyprus where he was working as an estate agent. Stephen Ward received more than £7,600 in disability payments after he set up home in the resort town of Deryneia. Ward, 49, failed to inform the Department of Work and Pensions when he emigrated abroad with his wife and two children. The father of two had suffered a serious motorcycle accident in his early 20s which had damaged his ligaments. He had qualified for the welfare support payments as . he could not walk more than five-metres in a minute - but he should not have been able to claim  the payments while living outside the UK, Burnley Magistrates Court heard. Ward  - who has now returned to Burnley, Lancashire - pleaded guilty to committing fraud by dishonourably failing to disclose information that he was no longer resident in the UK. He was ordered to repay all the money and wear a tag after he admitted fraud. The court heard Ward of Nelson, Lancashire, was arrested last year on his first day of work at Your Move estate agents in King William Street, after a tip-off from a resident. Alex Mann, prosecuting, said: 'The evidence came to light through intelligence. 'The offence is that he was out of the country, and that he was living and working in Cyprus.' The prosecutor said Ward emigrated to the popular holiday destination in the Famagusta district in March 2007 not returning until April 2010, without informing the Department of Work and Pensions. Nick Cassidy, defending, said his client initially went to the resort to visit friends, not intending to stay long-term. The solicitor said: 'He later moved out there with his family, and continued to accept the payments into his bank account.' Mr Cassidy said: 'He was working as an estate agent in Cyprus.' The court heard Ward worked for several estate agents in the country, buying and selling properties, including Burke Brothers Moving Group and Buy and Sell. He had qualified for the welfare support payments as he could not walk more than five-metres in a minute - but he should not have been able to claim  the payments while living outside the UK, Burnley Magistrates Court heard . In . reference to the defendant’s disability, Mr Cassidy said: 'Mr Ward had a . motorbike accident in his early 20s which damaged his ligaments and . gave him a subsequent infection. 'Since . then, he has experienced the sensation of his femur rubbing against his . tibia, giving him a chronic condition causing him pain. 'He made a long-term claim for disability living allowance, but the rules are now much more strict in terms of reporting change in conditions.' In mitigation, Mr Cassidy said Your Move, Ward’s current employer, had assured him they would allow him to continue working for them after being sentenced. The offences were all committed before he began work at Your Move. Magistrates ordered Ward to pay back the full amount of £7,633, at £20 per week, £85 court costs and a £60 victim surcharge. He claimed disability benefits for three years even though he¿d moved to Cyprus where he was working as an estate agent . He must also adhere to a curfew to remain at home between the hours of 7pm and 7am, and wear an electronic monitoring tag. Derek Taylor, chairman of the bench, allowed Ward to be free of the curfew for June 4 and 5, as he is attending a 50th birthday celebration. Summing up, Mr Taylor said: 'Aggravating factors are that this was over a three-year period. 'Mitigating, there is the fact that you did not intend to stay for so long. 'But you should have informed somebody as time went on. 'So we will give you a high level community order to punish you, and to protect the public.'","Stephen Ward received more than £7,600 in disability payments .

Chen Teng posted the images to traffic police in Shenzhen city in south east China’s Guangdong province using a computer in his BMW. But his postings on weibo, the Chinese version of Facebook, proved his downfall when he made one insulting remark too many and police swooped to seize his car. Chen Teng posted pictures on the internet of him holding beer cans, left, while driving his BMW. Police later seized the 29-year-old's car and found beer cans in the boot, pictured right . In one message, accompanied by a picture of him holding a beer, he asked: ‘Is it unlawful to drive while drinking?’ And in another he asked: ‘Do you really think ten beers is too much to drive with?’ Teng also boasted of violating numerous traffic laws and not ‘giving a damn.’ He uploaded his pictures and insults to the internet where, instead of being hailed a hero for poking fun at the authorities, he became a hate figure because he was putting the lives of innocent drivers in danger. He had tried to escape by deleting the account but police had already seized the relevant images.

"By . Richard Spillett . If he thought he would get away with trashing a new set of CCTV cameras, then this suspected vandal was wrong. Because the devices - set up to stop fly-tippers in rural Hertfordshire - captured his every move as he did his worst with an air rifle, causing £1,000 of damage. St Albans City and District Council recently fixed four cameras along Bedmond Lane near Abbotts Langley after mounds of household waste were found dumped along the street. Police want to speak to a man seen taking aim at CCTV cameras installed at a notorious fly-tipping hotspot . The CCTV cameras got clear images of the man, who was wearing a checkered shirt, jeans and white shoes . But not long after the cameras were installed, a vandal apparently drove along the road and shot at the public-funded devices. Police have now released an image of man they want to speak to, with pictures showing him raising what looks an air rifle and taking aim at the cameras. The incident is believed to have happened between 5pm on April 18 and 7.40am on April 21. Vanessa Williams, landlady of the local Holly Bush pub, said: 'Flytipping has always been a problem down there. 'People come, probably on a daily basis, and drop off all manner of things, TVs, furniture, fridges, garden waste and all sorts. 'I didn't even realise they had put cameras down there but it's disgusting they have already been damaged. It doesn't suprise me though, it's the way of the world these days.' The road is thought to have become a target for fly-tippers due to its proximity to both the M25 and M1 motorways. Anyone with information is asked to contact PC Jane Flemmons at Hertfordshire Police or call Crimestoppers, the independent charity, anonymously on 0800 555 111. Locals were shocked by the incident, which took place on a lane known to have been targeted by fly-tippers .","Council put up four cameras on rural street repeatedly used by fly-tippers .

"By . Richard Spillett . Four out of five new mothers now opt to give birth while listening to music, a new poll has found . Four out of five new mothers listened to music while they gave birth - with Diana Ross' 'Ain't No Mountain High Enough' and 'Roar' by Katy Perry the most popular choices, a poll has revealed. Researchers quizzed 1,030 mothers online and found most felt music helped them maintain some sense of control during the final stages of labour. Among their favourite ante-natal anthems were 'Greatest Day' by Take That, 'Angels' by Robbie Williams and 'You're Beautiful', by James Blunt. The Beatles classic 'Let it Be' also made the top 10, as did 'Circle of Life' from the Lion King. 'I'm Every Woman' by Chaka Khan and 'Empire State of Mind' by Alicia Keys & Jay Z can also be frequently heard emanating from the delivery suite, according to the report by parenting club Bounty. Lisa Penney, a spokeswoman for the club, said: 'Research has shown familiar music can help mums feel calm and in control when giving birth. 'And in a practical sense it can also help to block out distractions in the delivery room, such as background noise. 'With modern technology now allowing us to download music whenever and wherever we want, it's unsurprising that we've seen a growing trend amongst mums-to-be for creating special playlists for labour.' The poll also found that, although many mums said they liked listening to music when they gave birth, two-thirds (61 per cent) could not actually remember which song their baby was born to. According to the research, most motherss used a mixture of genres on their playlists. Classical was the most popular genre (polling 15 per cent), followed by easy listening (14 per cent), pop (eight per cent), nature sounds, such as waves and whale sounds (six per cent) and rock (which also gained six per cent of the vote). 'Ain't No Mountain High Enough' by Diana Ross (left) and 'Roar' by Katy Perry (right) were among the most popular choices for music to give birth to, researchers have found . Mothers also believed their choice of music had an impact on their newborn baby, the report found. Many of the mums polled chose music because they wanted the baby to hear it when they arrived into the world, researchers were told. 1. Ain’t No Mountain High Enough - Diana Ross . 2. Roar - Katy Perry . 3. Angels - Robbie Williams . 4. Greatest Day - Take That . 5. You’re Beautiful - James Blunt . 6. I’m Every Woman - Chaka Khan . 7. Let it Be - The Beatles . 8. Circle of Life - Elton John . 9. Ave Maria - JS Bach . 10. Empire State of Mind - Alicia Keys & Jay . DJ Fearne Cotton has said that she couldn't give birth without . music playing and Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge made a labour . playlist, which contained music by Calvin Harris, Bruno Mars and Of . Monsters and Men. And US singer Mariah Carey celebrated the birth of twins Moroccan and Monroe by playing her own smash hit 'We Belong Together'. Ms Penney added: 'Labour playlists are fast becoming an essential part of mums' hospital bag today, but mums should think carefully about the music they choose to create the best atmosphere possible for birth. 'And when it comes to the type of music, our research shows it all comes down to personal taste when making the delivery room feel like home. 'Although you may want to consider whether head-banging heavy metal will really create the most relaxing environment to welcome a baby into the world.'","More than 1,000 new mothers polled about whether music helped labour .

"By . Hugo Duncan . Bank of England governor Mark Carney has turned his fire on City greed and the problem of growing inequality, calling for more to be done to clamp down on scandal-hit financial markets. Mr Carney said globalisation had led to huge earnings that were ‘amplifying the rewards of the superstar’ – but  ‘disturbing evidence’ suggested social mobility was decreasing. His remarks are likely to be seen as an attempt by the former Goldman Sachs banker to show he is not a cheerleader for the City, after a speech last year which was viewed as a departure from the scathing tone of his predecessor, Mervyn King. Stern: Mark Carney berated bankers for fuelling inequality while taxpayers picked up the tab . Mr Carney also defended the Bank’s low interest rate policy, saying it stimulated jobs – though he admitted it had caused a redistribution of wealth that hit savers. In his most outspoken remarks so far,  he said bankers operate in ‘a privileged heads-I-win-tails-you-lose bubble’. He accused them of a ‘host of scandals’ including fixing interest rates, currency markets and the gold price. He said huge bonuses encourage bankers to take ‘too much risk’, adding: ‘When bankers become detached from end-users, their only reward becomes money.’ He said the system is ‘amplifying the rewards of the superstar and, though few of them would be inclined to admit it, the lucky’. Mr Carney said banks in the UK and around the world are still ‘too big to fail’ – meaning taxpayers’ money must be used to prop them up in times of crisis. The Canadian, who succeeded Lord King as governor last July, told the Conference on Inclusive Capitalism in London: ‘Perhaps the most severe blow to public trust was the revelation that there were scores of too-big-to-fail institutions operating at the heart of finance. The speech will be seen as a move to distance himself from predecessor Mervyn King and the City . ‘Bankers made enormous sums in the run-up to the crisis and were often well compensated after it hit. In turn, taxpayers picked up the tab for their failures. ‘That unjust sharing of risk and reward contributed directly to  inequality but – more importantly – has had a corrosive effect on the broader social fabric.’ He warned about ‘the growing exclusivity of capitalism’, claiming the ‘basic social contract’ is ‘breaking down’ as the rich prosper at the expense of the less well-off. And he pointed to ‘disturbing evidence that equality of opportunity has fallen’, warning that the young could face a bleak future. 'Bankers made enormous sums before the crisis... taxpayers picked up the tab for their failures. That unjust sharing of risk and reward has had a corrosive effect on society' - Mark Carney yesterday . He said: ‘Social welfare systems . designed and enjoyed by previous generations may prove, absent reform, . unaffordable for future ones.’ In the wake of the financial crisis, the Bank of England was handed sweeping new powers over the financial system. Banks have been fined billions for scandals including the fixing of the Libor interest rate and the mis-selling of payment protection insurance. But no senior bankers have yet been prosecuted over scandals that took place after the global crash. Mr Carney warned jailing bankers will not fix bad behaviour. He said: ‘Merely prosecuting the guilty to the full extent of the law will not be sufficient to address the issues raised. Authorities and market  participants must act to recreate fair and effective markets.’ Critics claim it is business as usual in the City after Barclays hiked its bonus pool by 10 per cent to £2.4billion last month – despite a 32 per cent fall in profits.","Mark Carney 'disturbed' by bankers' wealth at the expense of taxpayers .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Injury: Lindsay Hawkins, 28, is in a coma after she was thrown from her horse Murphy (also pictured) when a gang of teenagers started throwing stones at the frightened animal . A mother of two is fighting for life in a coma after she was thrown from her horse when a gang of stone throwing teenagers ambushed her on a quiet country ride along a private track. Lindsay Hawkins, 28, was riding her . seven-year-old Shire Gipsy Cob cross Murphy on a private track in Wickersley, South Yorkshire, when it . was attacked by three or four yobs. The horse, who is 16.1 hands high, reared up and tried to run off, throwing Ms Hawkins to the ground. And the teenagers, aged around 13 to 15, fled as they saw her fall, without stopping to check how she was or help her. Ms Hawkins, who has two children, aged eight and four, was rushed to Rotherham Hospital where a scan diagnosed her with bad concussion and she was allowed home after two days. However, later that day she was re-admitted to hospital where she underwent surgery for a bleed on her brain - and is now in an induced coma while her family wait anxiously by her bedside to see how she recovers. She is critically ill. 'Lindsay is such a beautiful, lovely, kind-hearted and funny young woman who is the best friend you could wish for,' said friend Sarah Jane Binder, 33, who owns the livery where Ms Hawkins keeps her two horses. 'She’s an adoring mother who has two amazing children who are a credit to her. 'If anyone has any information about who is responsible for this I’m urging them to come forward. 'Look what’s happened as a result of this prank the teens have played - they didn’t mean for this to happen but someone needs to take responsibility for it. 'The doctors have told Lindsay’s family that it’s just a matter of waiting to see how she recovers when she comes out of the coma. 'She’s had damage to her brain stem, the part that controls her breathing, so she’s on a ventilator at the moment. 'The family are coping as best they . can, looking after Lindsay’s two little children, but as you can imagine . it’s an extremely worrying time for them.' Ms Binder said her friend had taken Murphy out that day because it had been his birthday. Private: Ms Hawkins was riding her horse down this private track when she was ambushed by the gang of young teenagers . 'She would normally ride with someone else but on that day because of timings she took him by himself,' she said. 'She hadn’t been away for long when Murphy turned up at the livery. My parents - who own the livery with me - were there at the time. They went out to look for Lindsay and found her - she’d actually just got up from where she’d fallen. 'She told them that about three or four youths had been throwing stones at Murphy, who’d got scared and reared, then tried to run away. She fell off but the kids just ran away without stopping to see if she was ok. 'They called an ambulance and then my dad rang me to come down, and I went with Lindsay in the ambulance to Rotherham hospital. She was quite disorientated but managed to tell me what had happened. She kept sort of drifting in and out of sleep.' Ms Binder said that a hospital x-ray revealed she had no broken bones, although a scan showed that she had suffered a concussion. 'They kept her in for 48 hours and then let her go,' she said. Emergency:  Ms Hawkins underwent surgery for a bleed on her brain - and is now in an induced coma while her family wait to see how she recovers . 'But on the day she came home, she started getting headaches which were getting worse so she went back to hospital. 'They found she had a bleed on her brain so sent her to Sheffield Hallamshire Hospital, where she had an operation the next day. 'She’s been in a coma since then to reduce the swelling on her brain, she’s on a ventilator too. 'The doctors have said it’s just a case of waiting to see how she improves. It’s critical she’s making improvements.' Ms Binder said her friend was a skilled horsewoman, who had been riding since she was around five years old. 'I’ve known her for about ten years so she’s a friend as well as keeping her horses at our livery,' she said. Starting point: Ms Hawkins had set off from this livery in Wickersley on May 17 when she was thrown from her horse . 'I’m frustrated, mad and very upset about the whole thing. 'We’ve been using that path for ten years and we’ve never had any trouble. If anyone has any information please tell the police' Police were today appealing for information to track down the teens following the attack at around 5.45pm on May 17. Officers have carried out enquiries in the Wickersley area in a bid to trace the youths, including a search on the day of the incident, but have so far been unable to find those involved. 'We are urging anyone who might have seen what happened or who has any information about the incident to come forward,' said Detective Inspector Steve Ashmore, of South Yorkshire Police. 'We’re also interested in hearing from anyone who has suffered similar problems in the area and will be visiting local stables. 'This incident shows the serious consequences of antisocial behaviour.'","Lindsay Hawkins, 28, was riding horse Murphy when they were attacked .

"By . Richard Spillett . Moped thieves have been jailed after footage from a cyclist's helmet camera showed them robbing an unsuspecting pedestrian. Courtney Morgan, 19, Walid Hnida, 18, and Michael Ahmed, 20, have all been locked up for their part in a spate of 46 offences in south London last year over just 11 days. Footage from a cycle camera shows Morgan, riding pillion, as he takes a mobile phone from a shocked woman outside Lambeth College in Clapham. Scroll down for video . Pictures show Courtney Morgan, riding pillion, snatching the phone of a woman pedestrian in Clapham . The gang used a stolen scooter to commit the spate of offences over an 11-day period last summer, during which they targeted a series of women, including one who was heavily pregnant. They operated across Wandsworth, Lambeth, Richmond upon Thames and Hammersmith and Fulham in south and west London. One woman was punched in the face and another was dragged along the pavement as she tried to keep hold of her phone which was eventually stolen. Another woman was pulled onto the hot exhaust of the bike and her leg was so badly burnt she needed hospital treatment. The pair rode up behind their unsuspecting victim and mounted the pavement outside Lambeth College . They then grabbed the phone of their victim (circled) before speeding off to later commit other thefts . The gang were sentenced at Kingston Crown Court this week after admitting conspiracy to steal at a previous hearing. Courtney Morgan was jailed for two years, Walid Hnida got three years and four months and Michael Ahmed was sentenced to four years and eight months. Another member of the gang, 16-year-old Deandre Riley-Reid received a Youth Rehabilitation Order for his part in the offences. A fifth gang member, 17-year-old Jerome Ashley Williams, will be sentenced later this month at the same court. Deandre Riley-Reid was given a youth rehabilitation order for his role in the crimes . Detective . Superintendent Penny Banham said: 'In total, Wandsworth CID solved 58 . individual offences of street robbery linked solely to this criminal . network whose crime spree came to a complete halt following a . phenomenally fast and detailed investigation. 'The value of the handsets stolen from across the four London boroughs stands at £120,000. Detective Inspector Mark Blackshaw, from Wandsworth CID, added: 'This was an organised group of criminals who targeted commuters and innocent members of the public who were going about their ordinary business. 'It became evident that the violence being used began to escalate throughout the series, including mopeds being ridden indiscriminately along busy pavements and victims being punched in the face for their mobile phones. 'I am in no doubt that had these offenders not been caught quickly, more serious injuries to the public would have been sustained.'

"By . Emma Glanfield . A six-year-old British boy is fighting for his life in hospital after being found unconscious at the bottom of a swimming pool during a luxury cruise holiday. The young boy was reportedly found at the bottom of one of the main outdoor pools on the Royal Caribbean’s Independence of the Seas cruise liner. He was travelling with his parents when the incident occurred as the ship passed off the Breton coast, off the north of France, yesterday. The six-year-old British boy was reportedly found at the bottom of one of the main outdoor pools on the Royal Caribbean's Independence of the Seas cruise liner (pictured) Emergency services were alerted after the youngster was allegedly found unconscious in the crowded pool shortly after lunchtime. His heart had stopped and he was no longer breathing, it was reported. Yann Bouvard, a spokesman for the maritime prefecture in the port of Brest, said: ‘The child was found in a state of cardio-respiratory arrest at the bottom of the ship's pool.’ He was pulled from the pool and the cruise liner’s on-board doctor carried out CPR, which was successful in getting his heart beating again. A French Navy NH90 twin-engine helicopter was scrambled to the scene just before 2pm after the ship’s captain raised the alarm to the Operational Centre for Maritime Surveillance and Rescue in Brittany. The boy was flown to Morvan Hospital in Brest where his condition was last night described as ‘serious’. It is not known how the incident occurred but it is thought an investigation will be launched into the circumstances surrounding it. The youngsters’ parents are said to be by his bedside in hospital after joining him on the flight from the luxury cruise ship to the mainland. A French Navy NH90 twin-engine helicopter was scrambled to the scene just before 2pm yesterday and took the boy to Morvand Hospital in Brest, France (file picture) Last night, Mr Bouvard described the incident as ‘incomprehensible’ and told The Times: ‘What is terrible is that children can drown without making any noise at all. ‘We’ve never had a case of a boy drowning in a pool on a ship before, but we have, unfortunately, a lot of experience of that happening in pools on land, and we know that it can happen to anyone, anywhere.’ The Independence of the Seas is a 1,112 ft long vessel belonging to US company Royal Caribbean Cruise Line (RCCL), which sails under the flag of the Bahamas. According to its website, it is capable of carrying up to 4,375 passengers and 1,360 crew members. It has three pools, including an adults-only Solarium pool, six whirlpools and a wave machine which it describes as an ‘interactive water park for kids and families filled with geysers, sculpted fountains and waterfalls.’ A seven-night stay on the Freedom-class 15-deck cruise liner for a family of four costs from around £1,600. The luxury ship is currently on a six-night sail across western Europe, having departed from Southampton on Sunday.

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . David Cameron's chief climate adviser has claimed Britain does not need any more wind turbines to hit renewable energy targets. Lord Deben said the public will be able to choose other ways to create green energy to avoid building ugly wind farms in the countryside. The Tory peer's remark fly in the face of official Government forecasts showing the numbers of wind turbines tripling by 2030 - adding almost 10,000 to the 4,000 onshore wind turbines already built. Onshore wind turbines split the Coalition, with Tory MPs increasingly hostile while the Lib Dems remain in favour. Nick Clegg has blocked cuts to wind subsidies, but David Cameron is planning to take a tougher line in the next manifesto . But the claim comes after David Cameron said there would soon 'come a time' when Britain had built enough wind farms to slash Government turbine subsidies. Last month Mr Cameron said: 'We’ve got the largest offshore wind farm anywhere in the world built off the coast of the UK and another one coming on stream, almost as big very, very shortly.' But he added: 'In terms of onshore wind, obviously there will come a time when we will have built enough to meet all our targets and so I’ve always said with subsidies, we shouldn’t keep subsidies for longer than they are necessary and so that is something we will be looking at.' David Cameron, as leader of the opposition, promised to lead the 'greenest Government ever' but has since come under fire as Prime Minister for the Coalition's support for onshore wind farms . Lord Deben, the peer better known as John Gummer, has gone even further, claiming that the are alreadt enough wind farms with planning permission and no more are needed. He said Britain needed a 'portfolio of different mechanisms'. The peer said: 'I'm happy that we have already got enough onshore wind to 2020 to meet that part of the portfolio.' The peer's remarks come amid claims that the Tories are planning to go into the next election pledging to 'rid' the countryside of onshore wind farms. A source close to the Prime Minister said Mr Cameron wants to toughen planning laws and tear up subsidy rules to make current turbines financially unviable – allowing the Government to 'eradicate' turbines. The Conservatives could make a manifesto pledge to cap the total number of wind farms, toughen up planning rules to make them harder to build or even lower Government subsidies for turbines, it is understood. Former agriculture minister John Gummer - now known as Lord Deben - famously posed with his four-year-old daughter Cordelia tucking into a burger to show beef was safe during the mad cow disease crisis . It comes after the government agreed that subsidies for onshore turbines would be cut by five per cent a year after 2015 under a deal reached by the coalition partners. In 2012, support for onshore wind was cut by 10 per cent after the PM came under pressure from more than 100 backbench MPs, who wrote to him demanding action against windfarms spoiling the landscape in rural areas. In November it emerged that Mr Cameron had ordered aides to 'get rid of all the green crap' from energy bills to bring down costs. The Prime Minister wanted the green levies, which go towards paying for renewables and helping poor people cut energy use, to be cut.","Lord Deben said the Government did not need to sign off any new turbines .

"By . Belinda Robinson . Suspected drug dealers threw bags of cannabis and . loose cash out of windows in a bid to get rid of evidence as police carried out a series of raids across the capital this morning, . Officers arrested two teenagers who have been confirmed as brothers as part of the operation targeting suspected drug dealers in London. The boys, aged 14 and 15 years old are thought to be prominent gang members in Westminster. Hiding evidence: Drugs and money were thrown out of a window as police force entry into a property in Chaucer House, on the Churchill Gardens estate . Arrested: A man is arrested and put into a police van from Chaucer House, on the Churchill Gardens estate . Patrol: A lone police officer checks the area outside the block of flats on the Churchill Gardens estate . The juveniles were among 22 people . rounded up by over 200 police officers who were hunting down dealers . with connections to gangs and drugs. They were all aged between 14 and 25. Nineteen of the 22 were arrested this morning, 18 on supplying controlled class A and class B drugs, and one woman was arrested on possession of a class A drug. Police battered down the door of one suspected dealer at 6.15am on the Churchill Gardens Estate in Pimlico. But as officers used a battering ram, . known as a rabbit, on the door, screaming 'police', bags of cannabis and . loose cash were thrown out the window and into the bushes below the . second floor flat. During the raids, a 19-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possession with the intent to supply. The arrests were made for supplying controlled substances not for intent to supply as previously reported. Raid: Officers carried out dawn drugs raids across London today - the culmination of a five month intelligence led operation from officers across Westminster . Battering ram: Police force entry into a property in Chaucer House, on the Churchill Gardens estate . Taken away: An officer leads a man away - who is thought to be a suspected drugs dealer - wearing a grey hoodie and jeans from the Churchill Gardens estate - . Simultaneously, another flat in Chaucer House was knocked on, rather than broken down, and a 17-year-old man was arrested. Another . two addresses in the affluent Chelsea Gardens, only yards from the . Chelsea Flower Show, were raided, but no arrests were made. Kicked off: This is the aftermath of police forcing entry into a property in Chaucer House, on the Churchill Gardens estate . Addresses: Chaucer House was among several addresses raided by over 200 police officers . Search: Police search the area below a property in Chaucer House, on the Churchill Gardens estate for the drugs  thrown out of the window . Operation . Accomack was spearheaded by Belgravia Police Station, they had pictures . of 22 suspects with code names such as 'Syria' and Greece'. Some of the targets had 'arrested' pinned to the picture, with more expected to be pinned down as the day progressed. Today . was the culmination of a five month operation, in which police have . acted on tip offs from people around two Pimlico Estates Churchill . Gardens and Warwick Estate, who have raised concerns about prolific drug . dealing of cannabis, heroin, crack cocaine and MDMA within the borough. Following . an extensive intelligence led-investigation by officers, police say it . had become clear that there was open drugs market in certain parts of . the borough and that local gangs were involved in dealing and the . violence that goes with it. Officers also carried out a weapon sweep following a spate . of stabbings across the borough in  recent months. The estates are where Hani Hicham Abou . El Kheir, 16, died after he was chased and stabbed by a ten-strong gang . armed with a 'formidable' array of weapons in a 'brutal and merciless . attack' near his home in Pimlico last January. In the past gangs have hidden knives 'in plant pots in every corner of the estate' until police launched a crackdown. But the drug gangs still sought ways to stash away their arsenals on the estate which are just streets away from where the health secretary and a TV presenter live. A . public meeting is due to take place on the 29 May at the Churchill . Gardens Hall, giving local residents the opportunity to get an update . following today's arrests. Drugs: A bag of drugs can be seen in the bushes around the area where the raid took place this morning . Bushes: Police search the area below a property in Chaucer House, on the Churchill Gardens estate after drugs and money were thrown out of the window when police were forcing entry into the property . Investigating: Police use a flashlight, right, to look through bushes in an area below Chaucer House . Acting Detective Chief Inspector Philip Grindell said: 'Today's series of warrants and arrests are as a direct result of concerns we have had from residents and we are committed to listening to the local community and making Westminster a safer borough for people to live and work in. 'We have a clear mandate to reduce the drug activity and the violence that is associated with. Along with the local authority and partner agencies we will continue to divert young people away from gangs to ensure areas such as the Churchill Gardens estate are a more enjoyable place to live. Cash and drugs: Evidence bags containing money, drugs and jewellery are taken away by officers from a property in Chaucer House . In hiding: A man in a black jacket, jeans and trainers is flanked by two officers after he is arrested and put into a police van . In the van: The man is then put into a van by an officer as part of the raids which aimed to find drug dealers across London . 'Our work addressing these issues on the borough does not end here today and over the coming weeks we will continue to provide a visible and reassuring police presence across Westminster. 'I would like to personally thank the local community for supporting us with our efforts in disrupting and dismantling criminal activity in Westminster, this could not have been achieved without them. 'We still require their help and support in the coming weeks and months and we would encourage anyone with any information about on going drug and gang activity within the borough to come forward and speak to us. 'Any information provided will be treated in the strictest of confidence.' Sergeant Simon Taylor added that were weapons had become a big problem. He said: 'In a spell . last month over five days, we had an attempted abduction, a kidnap, a . man stabbed in the head and another stabbing. That's just here, in South . West One.' He said that criminals are now thinking of new ways to hide weapons. There tends to be a marker where the weapons are kept, so people know where they can find them quickly. Like golf balls for example. You can see them in the dark, and criminals will know there is a weapon there if needed. 'Even the money they get from crime - they will go to bookies and 'wash' it through the slot machines. They are always a step ahead. 'Within 10 minutes of opening this office, a quick search found two knives and a screwdriver. There were knives in plant pots in every corner of the estate.' Although Sergeant Taylor says he is confident that the 'bad guys' from the estate were arrested in the raids, he believes there may be a spike in crime. 'I anticipate there will be a minor spike in crime, where people have a greater confidence to call us, but I do think we will have a drop in crime in the near future. 'We have seen gangs from other areas such as east London who have been looking at the estate to see if there is scope to move in, so there could be a power struggle. 'There's a couple more who we are after who are on a middle level, who are out of our sphere, but we are confident we have got the right people this morning, no problem at all.' 'We have unusual gangsters here, they tend to wear school uniforms and ride a bike. 'We also border areas of untold wealth, so there is always a market for crime. Bagging evidence: One officer points towards what is thought to be evidence discarded by one of the dealers .

"By . Peter Campbell . Rapped: Earlier this month an investment scheme used by Gary Barlow, pictured, and other members of Take That was struck down by a tribunal . Clamping down on Gary Barlow-style tax-dodging schemes led to HMRC collecting a record £23.9billion through its investigations in the last year. This was £3.2 billion more than the previous year and £9billion up on three years ago. The sum, which is in addition to regular tax revenues, was £1billion above the target set by George Osborne in his 2013 autumn statement. HMRC has seen its resources bolstered, with an army of 2,500 extra tax inspectors announced 18 months ago. But critics of the tax system say corporate giants such as Amazon and Google can still get away with paying a pittance. By funnelling money into offshore havens, large multinational companies are able to whittle down their tax bills to almost nothing in a practice that is legal but has been branded ‘immoral’ by MPs. Earlier this month an investment scheme used by Gary Barlow and other members of Take That was struck down by a tribunal. The ‘Icebreaker’ scheme was used by almost 1,000 people in an attempt to hide more than £300million from authorities. It claimed to invest in the music industry, claiming legitimate tax breaks. But a judge ruled that the setup was a wheeze used to dodge tax, and that no-body would seriously invest in it to make a profit. Since it was ruled illegal, the Take That star has faced called to be stripped of his OBE. Mr Barlow, who has refused to apologise, also faced criticism from David Cameron over the affair. The Prime Minister said he was ‘opposed to all aggressive tax avoidance’ and has previously called dodging schemes used by comedian Jimmy Carr ‘morally wrong’. Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP who chairs the Public Accounts Committee, said Mr Barlow ‘might want to show a bit of contrition by giving back his OBE’. When investment schemes that claim tax relief are set up, they have to be registered with HMRC. Tax authorities can then judge if they are legitimate investment projects, or merely a chance to try and rake in tax relief. HMRC then tries to shut down the scheme by pursuing it through the courts, and has been successful 80 per cent of the time. 'Immoral': The Amazon fulfilment centre in Peterborough. Critics of the tax system say corporate giants such as Amazon and Google can still get away with paying a pittance by funnelling money into offshore havens . It has raked in £2.7billion by tackling such schemes in the last 12 months, HMRC said yesterday. A further £8billion has been collected by preventing big businesses from claiming tax relief for which they were not eligible. Another £1billion was raked in after preventing criminal tax evasion – where people or businesses simply lie about their revenues. David Gauke, exchequer secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘We set HMRC ambitious targets to increase its yield and the figures published today demonstrate that HMRC is successfully meeting these challenges. ‘It also sends a clear signal – HMRC will pursue those seeking to avoid their responsibilities and will collect the taxes that are due.’","Sum beats target set by Osborne's 2013 autumn statement by £1billion .

"By . Amanda Williams . Derek Hardman, 31, was discovered snoozing by pensioners Betty Spencer, 77, and husband John, 71 . A 'Goldilocks' burglar who fell asleep on the sofa in the house of his pensioner victims after he had raided £10,000 worth of jewellery has been jailed. Derek Hardman, 31, was discovered snoozing by pensioners Betty Spencer, 77, and husband John, 71, after he had prowled around their bedroom, and plundered jewels and Mr Spencer's fishing equipment. The career criminal was found snoring away on the couple's bedroom sofa after he became 'overcome with tiredness'. Mrs Spencer, who had been in the lounge watching television, discovered the sleeping raider and called for her husband and neighbours. The group then poked the criminal to wake him up - and held onto him until police arrived. Hardman - who has a string of burglary convictions -  had sneaked in to the couple's sheltered accommodation through an unlocked door on the afternoon of May 5, and made his way into their room as they watched television, Bolton Crown Court heard. He was said to have been 'overcome by tiredness' as he rummaged around the couple's first-floor flat in Deane, near Bolton, Greater Manchester. Initially Hardman searched the room, moving jewellery worth £10,000 and fishing equipment. But he decided to 'take a breather' on the sofa in the bedroom's bay window and dozed off. When he was woken up, Hardman tried to bite the leg of one of the neighbours but the fabric of his trousers saved the victim from injury. Police called to the flat, found six diazepam tablets in his pocket. Inquiries revealed Hardman was on licence from a previous prison sentence at the time of the raid. Hardman - who has a string of burglary convictions - had sneaked in to the couple's sheltered accommodation through an unlocked door on the afternoon of May 5, and made his way into their room as they watched television, Bolton Crown Court heard . In 2010 he was jailed for seven and a half years after he forced his way into the home of 93-year old great-great-grandmother and pushed her over so he could grab £100 from her purse. Yet is is thought he had been freed early last year for good behaviour. He has a long history of previous convictions for theft and burglary, including 12 months for burgling an 87-year-old woman in May, 2003, and 22 months for robbery in February, 2008. His targeting of OAPs led to calls for CCTV to make the elderly feel safer at home. On Tuesday Hardman pleaded guilty to burglary with intent, assault and possessing diazepam and was sent back to jail for a further two years and eight months. He claimed he had no recollection of the incident. Hardman is not due to be released until 2017. At a previous hearing, defence counsel Philip Parry said Hardman was 'in the vice-like grip' of drug addiction when he committed his crimes. He added: 'He is very sorry for what he has done and is trying to get clean in prison.'","Derek Hardman, 31, was discovered snoozing by his pensioner victims .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Ministry of Defence scientists secretly poisoned guinea pigs with the same deadly nerve agent sarin used by Bashar al-Assad in Syria. Over the past two years 223 guinea pigs were given the banned gas, revered as one of the most murderous weapons in modern warfare, by scientists at the military science base Porton Down in Wiltshire. The MoD says the 'vital' tests on the animals, who were not anaesthetised, were carried out in the battle to find an antidote for sarin, used by Syrian president Bashar al-Assad in an attack against his own people last August. Tests: Over the past two years 223 guinea pigs were given the banned gas by scientists at the military science base Porton Down in Wiltshire (pictured) Assad denied his soldiers were responsible for the attack on the outskirts of Damascus, which killed more than 1,400 people, many of them children, and prompted the threat of military action by the US unless Syria's chemical weapons were destroyed. But news that the tests were being carried out on animals at Porton Down has angered animal rights charity Peta. 'After all the Prime Minister's tough talk about Syria, it's deplorable that the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has been secretly using the same chemical nerve agents that Assad has used in order to poison hundreds of animals within our own borders,' a spokesman told MailOnline. 'Not only are these tests cruel, they're also utterly useless, since even though humans and other species experience pain and fear in the same way, every species differs in its physiological responses to chemical agents and antidotes. 'The fact that the MoD, with the best technology in the world at its disposal, still chooses to torture animals in costly and agonising experiments, which cannot be extrapolated to humans, is a bloody stain on the whole country. Antidote: The MoD says the 'vital' tests on the animals were carried out in the battle to find an antidote for sarin, used by Syrian president Bashar al-Assad in an attack against his own people last August . 'These experiments, using a banned nerve gas, no less, prove that the government's claims about trying to find alternatives to live testing are entirely meaningless.' The MoD says that after the tests the animals were humanely put down using an overdose of anaesthetic. 'This is vital research used to develop antidotes which save the lives of both troops and civilians, a spokesman told MailOnline. 'Advances in technology mean that we . are reducing the number of procedures carried out, but some research . simply cannot be conducted without the use of animals. Sarin was first developed as pesticide by the Germans in 1938. It has since been identified as one of the most potent and rapidly acting of the so-called nerve agents. Even at very low concentrations Sarin can kill in less than ten minutes as direct inhalation leads to suffocation . from lung muscle paralysis, unless an antidote can be administered. Sarin in its vapor form causes symptoms within seconds and in its liquid form symptoms appear within minutes. Sarin . stops the off-switch enzyme of the body's glands and muscles, causing . them to work continuously, Symptoms include: Runny nose, watery eyes, . pinpoint pupils, eye pain, blurred vision, drooling and excessive . sweating, cough, chest tightness, rapid breathing, diarrhea, nausea, . vomiting, and/or abdominal pain, increased urination, confusion, . drowsiness, weakness, headache, slow or fast heart rate, low or high . blood pressure. Even a small . amount of sarin can cause serious injury and many victims will not know . they've been exposed to the oderless, colorless, tasteless compound. Sarin has been classified as a weapon of mass destruction and production and stockpiling of the chemical is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993. 'All . such work complies with the Chemical Weapons Convention which allows . research on chemical weapons for the development of antidotes.' The spokesman added that examples of MoD research include improved treatments of trauma which have saved lives in Afghanistan, a treatment for botulism which has saved civilian lives, and safe and effective treatments and pre-treatments for biological and chemical agents. Just a few drops of sarin, which has no taste, no smell and no colour, can be enough to kill a person in under 10 minutes. It is usually emitted from a canister or missile, releasing a cloud of droplets fine enough to be inhaled, and can also enter the body through the eyes and skin. Victims suffer muscle paralysis and even those who survive can be left with permanent neurological damage. The row of guinea pigs is the latest in a line animal cruelty scandals to hit the MoD. Last month it was revealed in a Freedom of Information request that almost 200 horses were put down by MoD vets in the last decade, including 20 that were physically healthy but were said to have 'dangerous temperaments.' And in March it emerged that more than 100 pigs have been blown up in Britain over a three-year period for research into battlefield injuries. Some 115 have been killed to test if they could be saved after being injured in blasts - and a group were even put in body armour before being blown up at Porton Down. Animal rights groups say the exercises are ‘impossible to justify medically, ethically or educationally’, but the Ministry of Defence insists they help develop treatments that have saved lives in warfare. It has also been revealed that more than 350 retired military dogs have been put down since 2009. The MoD put down 42 British dogs due to a 'dangerous temperament', while 27 developed cancer-related health problems. The majority, 117 were put down due to 'age and welfare' reasons while 76 had osteoarthritis. Four were killed in action in Afghanistan, and a fifth was put down due to injuries from a road accident.","223 guinea pigs given banned gas by MoD scientists in the past two years .

"By . James Salmon . Follow @@JamesSalmon79 . Millions of ordinary investors will be given the chance to snap up free shares in Lloyds spin-off TSB. Lloyds has confirmed plans to start floating the new challenger bank on the stock market next month. TSB is still remembered by many for its 1980’s slogan ‘the bank that likes to say yes’. Lloyds has confirmed plans to start floating spin-off challenger bank TSB on the stock market next month. Pictured: Dr Paul Pester relaunching TSB in Baker Street, London . But it was re-launched in September almost twenty years after disappearing from the UK High Street. It is made up of 631 branches Lloyds was forced to sell off by the European Commission as a condition of its £20billion bail out by taxpayers during the financial crisis. A quarter of the shares will be sold initially, with the offer open to ordinary retail investors as well as institutional investors such as pension funds. To entice retail investors they will be offered one free ‘loyalty’ share for every 20 they buy, as long as they hang on to them for at least a year. Lloyds wants to prevent savers from trying to make a quick profit by cashing in their shares early- as happened with the float of Royal Mail last October. But investors will have to wait until 2017 before TSB is in a position to hand out dividends. Retail investors will only be allowed to buy a fifth of the shares on offer, with the remainder allocated to institutional investors. Lloyds will also foot the bill for any mis-selling that occurred under its watch, including payment protection insurance which has cost the bank almost £10billion so far. The announcement comes just days after over-50s cruise and finance firm Saga launched a £2.1billion float on the stockmarket. Half of the shares were bought by retail investors, but the float was considered a flop as the shares were sold on the cheap. Chief executive Paul Pester (above) said TSB would be different from other scandal-hit lenders on the High Street . Yesterday chief executive Paul Pester launched an appeal to customers and potential investors, promising that TSB would be different from the other scandal-hit lenders on the High Street. ‘We are building a very straightforward simple bank where every penny invested by savers is only used to support mortgages and loans to other TSB customers.’ He added: ‘You can never say never. But I’m doing everything in my power to minimise the likelihood that there will be a new mis-selling scandal at TSB.’ Offloading the branches has proved a major headache for Lloyds, with the Co-op pulling out of a £750million deal to buy the branches last April. Lloyds has run up a £1.6billion bill to create a separate lender, which it called TSB – resurrecting a brand which disappeared when Lloyds merged with TSB in 1995. Launched in September, TSB has 4.5million customers  - most of whom were transferred from Lloyds TSB and Cheltenham & Gloucester. TSB is the seventh biggest bank on the High Street, but is planning to boost its share of the market and expand its network of branches. Lloyds has to sell off the rest of TSB by the EC deadline which falls at the end of next year. The first sell off next month will also clear the way for the Government to sell off a third tranche of taxpayers’ stake in Lloyds in the Autumn. It is expected to finally open up the offer to retail investors, having raised £7.4billion from selling two tranches of shares to institutional investors. This has reduced taxpayers’ stake from 39pc to 25pc.","Ordinary investors will be given the chance to snap up free shares in TSB .

"By . Damien Gayle . Nigeria's president . nearly swapped Boko Haram prisoners for the girls the . group is holding hostage after he was delivered a video of them begging . him to make the deal, it is claimed. But . Goodluck Jonathan is said to have scrapped the arrangement under . pressure from Western governments, who did not want him to negotiate with the Islamist insurgents. The . claims come as Boko Haram fighters today killed 24 policemen and . soldiers in a single attack and Cameroon deployed a thousand men to its . border to counter the Islamist threat. Pressure: Goodluck Jonathan at the Paris Summit for Security in Nigeria earlier this month. It is claimed that he scrapped a plan to exchange Boko Haram prisoners for schoolgirls held captive by the group after attending . The . video was apparently handed to Mr Jonathan's office by a Nigerian . journalist with contacts in Boko Haram, who obtained it as a way of . proving he was in contact with rebel leaders. But . a source close to the militia told The Telegraph that a deal to then . release some of the girls was abandoned after the president came under . pressure to play hardball in negotiations. Nigeria's . government has denied that any such deal was mooted and has neither . confirmed nor denied the existence of a video, according to The . Telegraph's Colin Freeman. Yesterday, . Nigeria's chief of defence staff claimed the military had discovered . the whereabouts of the 276 girls Boko Haram snatched from their boarding . school dormitories seven weeks ago. Air . Marshal Alex Badeh said: 'The good news for the parents of the girls is . that we know where they are, but we cannot tell you. But where they are . held, can we go there with force? We can't kill our girls in the name . of trying to get them back.' The . girls have been tracked to three camps in the north of Nigeria, near . Lake Chad, 200 miles from where they were abducted, senior officials . told a Nigerian newspaper on Friday. A still taken from a video by Nigeria's Boko Haram terrorist network shows the missing girls. A top Nigerian military official says the authorities know where the girls are, but cannot move in over fears for their safety . The . source of the video said to show some of the girls is Ahmed Salkida, a . journalist from the same north-east state of Borno where the Boko Haram . insurgency has its stronghold, said The Telegraph's source. Mr . Salkida has on past occasions been arrested on suspicion of being a . Boko Haram sympathiser and has been in effective exile from Nigeria with . his family in Dubai for the past two years. About . a month ago, however, Nigerian officials agreed to allow Mr Salkida to . return so he could help negotiate the release of the captive girls. He initially feared he might face arrest, but was then given a letter of indemnity signed by the president when he flew to Nigeria. Along . with a trusted cleric he embarked on a dangerous trek into the bush to . track down the militant group and was able to meet with a senior . assistant of Abubakar Shekau, Boko Haram's leader. 'The . government said to the intermediary to prove himself to show whether he . was capable of brokering a deal or not, and insisted that he should . obtain proof of life of the hostages,' the source said. 'So . during his talks with the insurgents, he obtained a DVD which had clips . of girls being interviewed by members of the group, in which they asked . President Jonathan to do a prisoner swap to get them freed.' Off . the back of the video, a deal was struck to release 50 of the girls in . exchange for an equal number of Boko Haram prisoners for last Monday. But the government backed out at the last minute. The . source pointed out that the weekend before the planned swap Mr Jonathan . met with British and American officials at a crisis summit in Paris, . which was also attended by the governments of Niger, Cameroon and Mali. He . may have been afraid that if he had gone through with the deal he would . have lost the support of the West, the source said. Talks with Boko . Haram subsequently broke down and Mr Salkida returned to Dubai, it is . claimed. Boko Haram  leader Abubakar Shekau offered to trade the girls for the release of prisoners, which was declined by the Nigerian government . The new account of . the behind the scenes negotiations between Boko Haram and the Nigerian . government comes as militants attacked a military base and police . barracks, killing 24 police and soldiers. The . attack occurred not far from where the Islamist insurgents shot or . burned to death 59 pupils at a boarding school in February, Reuters . reported. Meanwhile a . spokesman for Cameroon's defence ministry announced that a 1,000 . soldiers backed up with armoured vehicles had been sent to its border . with Nigeria, to counter a rising threat from Boko Haram. 'Their . mission will be to carry out reconnaissance and be ready to respond . with enough fire power,' Lieutenant Colonel Didier Badjeck told Reuters . by telephone from Yaounde. Boko . Haram, which outraged international opinion with the mass abduction of . schoolgirls from their boarding school in Chibok, in Nigeria's Borno . State, has also carried out attacks in northern Cameroon.

The mother of an inspirational teenage cancer victim who raised almost £4million for charity today called on well-wishers to ‘do something to make others happy’ in his memory. A two-day vigil for 19-year-old Stephen Sutton, who succumbed to multiple tumours earlier this month, is due to start tomorrow at Lichfield Cathedral in Staffordshire. Mr Sutton's bravery in facing his terminal illness while urging people to enjoy life became a global phenomenon, reaching millions of people. His mother Jane Sutton said: ‘The continued love and support for Stephen is wonderful and a great comfort.’ She has called on people at 11am on Friday to ‘do something that makes you and others happy in Stephen's memory’. The timing will coincide with a Thumbs Up For Stephen event - which is being publicised with the Twitter hashtag #ThumbsupforStephen. It has been organised while the vigil is under way. The vigil starts at 7pm on Thursday, when people are welcome to light a candle, lay flowers, reflect by the coffin and sign a book of condolence in the young campaigner's honour. Mrs Sutton added: ‘I want people to have the chance to come and pay their last respects to Stephen. ‘It is important that the vigil at Lichfield Cathedral has an opening and a public farewell, so I invite people especially to come and be part of these two moments and remember Stephen. ‘Stephen wanted to put the fun in funeral, so don't feel you need to wear black. It's a celebration of his life and achievements.’ She added: ‘If you can't make it, remember to take a moment at 11am on Friday morning to give a thumbs up for Stephen.

There is to be a short opening ceremony at the cathedral at 7pm and the cathedral will remain open until midnight for people to pay their respects. Doors reopen at 7am on Friday, before a public farewell ceremony at 3pm. At 3.45pm on Friday, Mr Sutton's coffin will exit The Close and leave Lichfield for a private family funeral. Over the past few days people touched by Mr Sutton's memory have tied hundreds of yellow ribbons up around his home town. Mr Sutton's campaign to raise awareness and money for the Teenage Cancer Trust attracted huge support, earning praise from celebrities like Russell Brand, Simon Cowell, Ricky Gervais and Jason Manford. Prime Minister David Cameron met Mr Sutton while in hospital, and following his death on May 14, said: ‘I can hardly think of anyone I've met with such a zest for life, and such a belief that you can get things done, and who wanted to live every minute. He was absolutely inspiring.’ Before dying, Mr Sutton - who was working his way through a bucket list - said: ‘I don't see the point in measuring life in terms of time any more. I'd rather measure life in terms of making a difference.’ The social media campaign website Thunderclap.it has rated the Stephen's Story drive as having a total global reach across the internet of 5.11million people. Remembered: The vigil starts at 7pm on Thursday, when people are welcome to light a candle, lay flowers, reflect by the coffin and sign a book of condolence in the young campaigner's honour . The Stephen's Story Facebook site, where . the teenager gave regular updates on his work and latterly his . deteriorating health, now has 1.2million likes. Meanwhile, the total amount raised on Mr . Sutton's JustGiving fund-raising page now stands at £3.96million - the . single largest ever amount raised for the Teenage Cancer Trust. 'The continued love and support for Stephen is wonderful and a great comfort' Jane Sutton, mother . Staffordshire County Council's leader Philip Atkins said the vigil would be an ‘unprecedented event’ and showed how Mr Sutton's campaign had triumphed in bringing people together. He said: ‘Stephen Sutton's story is truly an inspirational one and people will undoubtedly be turning out in their thousands to pay their respects to Stephen and commemorate his spirit, courage and amazing achievements in his short life.’ It is estimated that up to 40,000 people will turn up over both days to honour the former Chase Terrace Technology College student.","Two-day vigil for Stephen Sutton will start tomorrow at Lichfield Cathedral .

"By . Mia De Graaf . A former soldier who battered his wife to death with a dumbbell after hiring a detective to expose her affair has been jailed for at least 17 years today. Nirmal Gill, 49, who killed wife Rosemary Gill, 48, in the bedroom of their Bristol home in the early hours of July 20 last year, was handed a life sentence at Bristol Crown Court. The killer beat her to death because he could not accept she wanted to 'move on and have a life without him', the jury was told. Guilty: Nirmal Gill, 49 (left), has been convicted of murdering Rosemary Gill (right) after uncovering her affair . Gill, showing no emotion, was jailed for life by Judge Neil Ford QC, the Recorder of Bristol, who told him he would serve a minimum of 17 years. 'You brutally bludgeoned your wife Rosemary to death, using a heavy dumbbell bar which you had taken from the hallway of your home and carried upstairs to her bedroom,' the judge said. 'You did so because your marriage was disintegrating. You wanted the relationship to continue but Rosemary in her own words 'no longer had anything to give'. 'She had begun to find happiness with another man and she had kept that a secret from you and your children.' Bristol Crown Court was told 'possessive' Gill had become suspicious of his wife’s behaviour and contracted a team to watch her movements. The firm fitted a tracking device to Mrs Gill’s Audi and regularly sent text updates of her location to Gill - who followed her in his own and borrowed cars. Eventually, he spotted his wife kissing and embracing her ex-husband Andrew Cooper. Three days later, he carried out the 'revenge' attack - using a metal dumbbell to strike his wife in the head at least 12 times. Mrs Gill’s naked and bloody body was discovered eight hours later by the couple’s daughter, Jasmine, 19, who had been sleeping in the room next door. Gill, who joined the regulars and served in Germany in 1985, admitted the manslaughter of his wife through a loss of control but denied murder. He claimed he could not remember the fatal event after taking a cocktail of prescription drugs and alcohol. The court heard the couple's 24-year marriage hit the rocks early last year, with arguments sparked by money troubles, and began to sleep separately. Rosemary sought solace in the arms of Mr Cooper, a lorry driver, to whom she was married between 1982 and 1986. They quickly began an intimate relationship and planned to move out together. In June last year she told Gill, father of her two children Zac and Jasmine, she wanted a divorce in June, contacted a solicitor to start the proceedings, and suggested he move in with his mother. Jailed: Gill, who pleaded not guilty to murder but was found guilty at trial, was sentenced at Bristol Crown Court . But furious Gill became suspicious and paid a private investigator to attach a tracking device to his wife’s Audi. On July 17, he followed her and spotted her kissing Mr Cooper - her husband of four years - at a secret meeting at Gordano service area on the M5 outside Bristol. Two days later, on July 19, Gill agreed to separate from his wife during a discussion about their future at a local pub. 'She . said, ""I have been your mother, not your lover, for 24 years"",' he . said. 'I was absolutely devastated, it was like my whole world was . crumbling in front of my eyes.' Mrs Gill returned home at 10pm, texting Mr Cooper. But at around 3am neighbours reported hearing banging noises. She had at least a dozen 'blunt force' injuries to the top and back of her head, which caused multiple fractures to her skull and fatal brain injuries. The father-of-two remained emotionless as the jury of nine men and three women returned their unanimous verdict to the single charge after two hours of deliberations. Gill told the jury he had attempted suicide that evening by taking paracetamol, prescription drugs, two cans of lager and up to half a bottle of vodka. 'He brought about the death of his wife but he has also destroyed the relationship with his children' - Henry Grunwald QC . He claimed he spotted his wife’s bedroom light was on after getting up to use the bathroom in the early hours of July 20. 'She said ""Nirmal, what are you doing?"",' Gill told the jury. 'She called me into the room. 'We started to cuddle and I was unable to get an erection. I remember Rosemary laughing at me and calling me a sad, sad, pathetic man. 'I just remember hitting Rosemary with the bar.' Forensic examinations found Mrs Gill had been clothed during the attack, with her underwear later ripped from her body. Gill later told police he had attempted to have sex with his wife 20 minutes after her death, but was not successful. In mitigation for Gill, Henry Grunwald QC described the murder as 'a tragic case for all concerned'. He said a victim impact statement written by Zac on behalf of the couple’s children spoke of their double loss. 'The loss that they feel, not only the loss of their mother but the effective loss of their father,' he said. 'He brought about the death of his wife but he has also destroyed the relationship with his children. 'He can only hope that in the years to come he can rebuild a relationship with them.' Mr Grunwald said evidence from two psychiatrists showed Gill had been suffering from a mental disorder at the time of the murder. 'It is only in the state that he was in at the time this offence was committed that it was committed,' he said.","Nirmal Gill, 49, discovered wife Rosemary, 48, was seeing ex-husband .

"By . Leon Watson . and Sophie Jane Evans . An experiment has shown how easy it is for fraudsters to find out a worrying level of personal information online - using just an email address. A team of actors set up a mailing list for bar customers, before using their email addresses to research their details online. Minutes later, they had garnered so much private information on the individuals that they could convince them they had known them for years. The shocking experiment, captured on video for credit reference agency Experian, shows the dangers of leaving yourself open to online ID fraud. Scroll down for video . The set up: Ad agency Abundance targeted five unsuspecting customers at a bar after getting information about them from an email list . The project then searched the internet for information on their victims, before getting ready to approach them . It reveals how easy it is for a stranger to research individuals - and also highlights the worrying amount of personal details that can be found from just an email. The video starts: 'Could we convince five perfect strangers that we were old friends...using only information anyone could find online?' It goes on to show the actors asking bar customers to put their emails on a mailing list, before using them to research their personal details on Google, Facebook and other websites. The researchers are then filmed going . back into the bar and trying to convince the customers they know them . based on details they have found out, including their previous holidays, . names, jobs, birthdays and even where they went to school. One . man, called Ziggy, appears initially shocked when a female researcher . calls his name - but then quickly gives her a hug and says 'Oh my god, . how are you doing?'

And . one woman even apologies to a female researcher who claims she danced . alongside her at a festival, saying: 'I'm so sorry, that was so rude of . me.' The video also features a man who claims his memory is 'coming back' to him, a woman who believes the meeting is 'so weird', and several customers who even agree to hand their mobile number over to researchers. When the customers eventually realised they had been fooled, they were all visibly stunned. The People's ID Bot Project and London agency Abundance conducted the experiment .

A . group called The People’s ID Bot Project and London agency Abundance . conducted the experiment after setting up an email list for drinkers and . searching the web for information about them. It was released after it was revealed last week that a cyber attack has compromised the details of 145 million eBay users. The auction site has been blasted for an . 'inexcusable delay' in taking action after its . servers were hacked three months ago. Caroline Thomas, MD Identity, Experian Consumer Services, said: 'The video was produced by Experian as part of our ongoing online identity protection education strategy, with the goal of having Britons sit up and take notice how much of people's personally-identifiable information is freely available online, often without them even realising. 'This same information, in the wrong hands, could be used to commit identity fraud or sold on to other criminals, often without the victim knowing until after a crime has been committed. 'While we enjoy the fantastic value and convenience the web has to offer, it’s important to be vigilant in protecting our online identities, too. 'Cybercrime is becoming increasingly complex and organised so exercising caution and making some simple changes to your online behaviour are key to helping protect yourself from becoming a victim.'","Bar customers were convinced into writing their email on fake mailing list .

"By . Amanda Williams . A victim of online abuse has revealed that she wanted to kill herself after she was subjected to two years of vile taunts on social media sites. Amber Barry, 18, was sent abusive messages on Facebook and Bebo about her looks by pupils at her school over the course of two years from the age of 13. The student was forced to twice change her account and spiralled into a depression which saw her contemplating suicide. Amber Barry, 18, was sent abusive messages on social media sites Facebook and Bebo about her looks by pupils at her school over the course of two years from the age of 13 . But with the help of her parents, Michael and Elaine, she was finally placed in a school where she gained the grades to go to Bury College, Greater Manchester. Amber, who has now nearly completed a health and social care course and wants to work as a pharmacist, believes the problem is only likely to get worse. It comes as a study found that social media bullying is now a bigger problem than email and text abuse. She said: 'I totally back calls that cyber bullies should face prosecution. They made my life miserable for years. The student was forced to twice change her account and spiralled into a depression which saw her contemplating suicide . 'If they had done it to my face, they would have had to face the music but, because it was behind an online profile, they got away with it. I think the threat of prosecution might also act as a deterrent to anyone thinking of doing it.' Amber's ordeal started in 2009 when she was just 13. She said: 'I was in year eight. At the time Bebo and Facebook were all the rage and that's where the bullying began. 'People would send me vicious messages every day, really horrible comments about the way I looked. 'They didn't like the fact I was speaking to another lad who was a friend of mine, so they'd post comments saying I was doing sexual things with him, all of which weren't true. 'Every day there would be messages and, after a while, it stopped me going into school. I just couldn't handle it any more.' She said she changed from a happy and sociable teenager into a recluse who would rarely come out of her room. She said: 'I kept thinking: ""What's the point?"" I thought it wouldn't matter if I was no longer here. 'I . didn't go out at weekends or socialise. I just stayed in my room. I got . depressed and would sleep all the time. I went from being happy and . bubbly to locking myself away in my room. When mum confronted me after . about a month, I burst into tears and told her. It was such a relief to . have someone on my side.' She said she believes it is too easy for a bully to attack people online because untraceable fake profiles are easy to create. She . said: 'I think to have a profile you have to prove who you are and that . you are a certain age. It's too easy for 13-year-olds to pretend they . are 18. 'What starts off with one or two bullies can quickly escalate into something too much for anyone to handle. 'You . can deal with two people, but not faceless Facebook groups. I ended up . shutting my Facebook and Bebo accounts for a long time until I was able . to get over it. 'In year 11, . when I began to make friends, I opened my Facebook account but kept it . private and only accepted people I like. I'm careful with it now because . it made my life hell.' But with the help of her parents, Michael (pictured) and Elaine, she was finally placed in a school where she gained the grades to go to Bury College, Greater Manchester . The social media report, by Nottingham Trent University psychology lecturer Dr Lucy Betts, studied 29 children aged 11 to 15. Dr Betts said: 'Increasing digitisation has led to growing concern over the effect this is having on the prevalence of cyberbullying and cyber victimisation.' Dr Barry Silvert, clinical director for integrated commissioning at NHS Bolton Clinical Comm-issioning Group, said: 'GPs often only learn that a young patient is being bullied when it has been going on for some time and is having a negative impact on their health. 'We are now seeing an increasing number of young people in who are struggling with mental health problems linked to bullying, including cyber-bullying. 'Bullying can undermine confidence and cause low self-esteem, anxiety and, in some cases, self-harm or depression. 'I encourage any young people who are being bullied to speak to someone they trust, such as a parent, carer, or teacher, before their mental health begins to suffer.' A Bolton Council spokesman said: 'Bullying is serious and pupils and parents should be assured that they will be fully supported by their school when reporting incidents.'","Amber Barry, 18, was sent abusive messages on social media sites .

"By . Jill Reilly . Egypt's former army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is expected to emerge victorious as the next head of state despite officials extending voting for an extra day after a low turnout at the polls. The two-day vote was originally due to conclude at 10pm on Tuesday but has now been extended until Wednesday to allow the ‘greatest number possible’ to vote. With victory for Sisi a foregone conclusion, the turnout is seen as crucial to shoring up the legitimacy of the field marshal who toppled Egypt's first freely elected head of state Mohamed Mursi last July. Former army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi (pictured) is expected to emerge from a second and final day of voting on Tuesday as Egypt's next head of state . Egyptian supporters of ex-army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, hold national flags celebrating in a street . With victory for Sisi a foregone conclusion, the turnout is seen as crucial to shoring up the legitimacy of the field marshal who toppled Egypt's first freely elected head of state, the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Mursi last July . After months of adulation, many . Egyptians were left shocked when the election failed to rally the . expected mass support predicted by Sisi himself. The . limited showing contrasted with parliamentary and presidential . elections held after Mubarak's overthrow, when voter lines were measured . in the hundreds and stretched far into the streets leading to the . polling stations. Sisi himself had called for a record turnout. Unlike the previous election which brought Mursi to power and was contested by a dozen candidates, Sisi faces only one rival now: the leftist Hamdeen Sabahi. Sabahi's campaign rejected the extension of voting as unjustified, given the lack of enthusiasm shown so far by many Egyptians. In a statement, it denounced the move as an attempt 'to prevent the Egyptians from expressing their opinion through manipulating the turnout rates and the voting percentages'. Some voters doubted whether any further support for Sisi might be found, despite the extension. 'I came to see the millions they said were coming to vote,' said Hussein Hassanein, a 24-year-old law student. 'I can't see anybody except two people and the electoral commission. 'I won't vote for either. This is a fake election. We know that Sisi is going to win. Who would you expect me to vote for?' An Egyptian priest and another Christian Coptic man walk out a polling station after casting their votes in Cairo . A voter shows her inked finger after voting, outside a polling station . Lines outside polling stations in . various parts of Cairo were short yesterday, and in some cases no voters . could be seen, even though the military-backed government had launched a . determined effort to get out the vote by declaring the day a public . holiday. The justice . ministry said Egyptians who did not vote would be fined, and train fares . were waived in an effort to boost the numbers. Local media loyal to the government chided the public for not turning out in large enough numbers. One prominent television commentator said people who did not vote were 'traitors, traitors, traitors'. Al-Azhar, . a state-run body that is Egypt's highest Islamic authority, said a . failure to vote was 'to disobey the nation', state TV reported. Pope . Tawadros, head of Egypt's Coptic church, also appeared on state TV to . urge voters to head to the polls. Turnout . in the 2012 election won by Mursi was 52 per cent - a level this vote . must exceed for Sisi to enjoy full political legitimacy, said Hassan . Nafaa, a professor of political science at Cairo University. Were . it to fall short, then he will have failed 'to read the political scene . and his miscalculation has to be corrected through reconciliation', he . said. Sisi had called for a turnout of 40 million, or 80 per cent of the electorate. Egyptians wait in line to vote at a polling station in the Sayeda Zeinab neighbourhood of Cairo . He enjoys backing from Egyptians worn down by three years of turmoil since Mubarak's downfall in 2011. While the Islamists demonise him as the mastermind of a coup, his backers see him as a hero for toppling Mursi after mass protests against his rule. Sisi's only challenger, Sabahi, came third in the 2012 election won by Mursi. Other candidates who contested the election won by Mursi did not run, saying the climate was not conducive to democracy following a crackdown on Islamist and other opposition groups. The Brotherhood, which came first in both parliamentary and presidential polls held after Mubarak's downfall, has been driven underground in a campaign of repression that has killed hundreds of its followers and landed thousands more in prison. In a move that has alienated many liberal Egyptians, secular dissidents have also been jailed, often for breaking a new protest law criticised as a threat to free assembly. Sabahi's campaign described turnout on the first day as 'moderate, and below moderate in some cases'. In a statement, it said there had been many violations, including physical assaults on Sabahi representatives, and 'intervention by police and army'. An Egyptian woman displays her ballot card at a polling station in the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria . The Brotherhood had called for a boycott, while other Egyptians described the election as a waste of time. Media run by the state and businessmen loyal to the army-backed authorities presented a different picture. 'Egyptians make history,' declared Al-Ahram, the state's flagship newspaper, showing a snaking line of men waiting to vote. 'Egyptians choose the president and declare the end of the Brotherhood,' announced Al-Masry Al-Youm, an independent newspaper hostile to the Islamist movement that was toppled after mass protests against Mursi's rule last year. On Monday, lines at 20 Cairo polling stations visited by Reuters consistently over the past three years appeared shorter than in previous elections. The interior minister said turnout was good.As the polls opened at 9.00 a.m. (0600 GMT) on Tuesday, there was no line at one Cairo polling station. At two others, around a half dozen people were waiting in line, fewer then on Monday when the queues there had been measures in dozens. Though young Egyptians - the generation that drove the 2011 uprising - were often hard to spot at polling stations on Monday, 19-year old Hamdy Abdelrahman was one of the first to cast his ballot on the second day of voting. Egyptian women wait in line to cast their votes outside a polling station . 'This country needs a military man now - someone who understands everything including laws, someone who can control the country,' Abdelrahman said. Outside a polling station in the affluent area of Zamalek dentist Adnan al-Gindi, 54, waited in line to vote for Sisi. 'I am voting for Sisi because we need to get rid of the Muslim Brotherhood. He stood behind the people to overthrow this garbage (Brothers). He will improve security and the economy.' The majority of those waiting with him said they would vote Sisi, except for one. 'It is not right to have a military man as president after the revolution. Even though we know somehow he will be the president, we can't let him win with 99 percent,' said Mohammed Khodr, 34, a film-maker. In Imababa, an Islamist stronghold, a line of young women waited in the heat to cast their votes for Sisi. 'He is the head of the army, he is respected, he is not corrupt or a thief so am voting for Sisi,' said Douaa Mohammad 34, mother of two. Sisi, 59, faces serious challenges including an economy in crisis and a campaign of Islamist violence that has spiralled since he overthrew Mursi. Several hundred members of the security forces have been killed in a campaign of violence by radical Islamists since last July. The last year has been the bloodiest period of internal strife in Egypt's modern history. Human Rights Watch estimates the number of political dissidents and Islamists in detention at more than 20,000. An Egyptian man reads a local newspaper with the headline in Arabic reading, ""Egypt surprises the world,"" outside a polling station in Cairo . An Egyptian drivers drives past banners supporting presidential candidate Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi . Western governments have raised concern about respect for freedoms. The Brotherhood and its allies, which had declared it 'the election of the presidency of blood', issued a statement saying their call for a boycott had been widely observed. The group has been declared a terrorist organisation by the state, which accuses it of turning to violence - a charge it denies. Sisi won 95 percent of votes cast in advance by Egyptians abroad, but an opinion poll by the Washington-based Pew Research Center suggests a more mixed picture, with Sisi viewed favourably by 54 percent and unfavourably by 45 percent. It is the second time Egyptians are electing a president in two years. And it is the seventh vote or referendum since 2011. Once president, Sisi will have to meet the high expectations of those who have backed him enthusiastically in the hope that he can tackle poverty, unemployment and other social problems. He will also be expected to address the corruption, cronyism and inequality between rich and poor that caused the 2011 revolution that overthrew Mubarak. Since the army overthrew the king in 1952, Egypt has been ruled by a succession of military men - Gamal Abdel Nasser, Anwar Sadat and Mubarak. That pattern was briefly interrupted by Mursi's divisive year in office, during which important institutions of state resisted his authority.","Former army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is expected to be victorious .

"By . Emma Glanfield . A former chartered accountant who was jailed for a £60,000 fraud is now helping inmates get tax rebates of up to £1,000. Paul Retout, the former chief executive of Wrexham FC, was jailed for 16 months in October last year after swindling his partners at a London-based accountancy company out of nearly £60,000. The 53-year-old, of Denbighshire, Wales, was sent to HMP Wandsworth in London where it has now been revealed he offered inmates ‘tax seminars’. Paul Retout, 53, of Denbighshire, Wales, was sent to HMP Wandsworth in London where it has now been revealed he offered inmates 'tax seminars (file picture) Writing in Inside Time magazine, Retout said many of the UK's 85,000 prisoners are due a tax rebate. He claims prisoners most likely to be in line for a 'windfall' are those who were jailed before reaching the annual £9,440 personal tax threshold, but who paid tax on earnings before being incarcerated. He said: ‘While I was recently in prison I volunteered to run a two hour taxation seminar under the business start-up education programme, and to share my tax experiences of setting up a business with my fellow prisoners. ‘What surprised me was that several prisoners attending the seminar were due tax refunds and were simply not aware of the fact.’ Retout, who was released earlier this year, said he soon realised that 'many more' prisoners at the 1,284 capacity jail in south London were due rebates from the taxman. He said: ‘As the weeks passed, I found that there were many more prisoners also due refunds who did not know the correct procedure to obtain them. ‘The average refund that I calculated while I was in prison was approximately £1,000.’ He said he was then moved to HMP Brixton, where he saw a similar situation, adding: ‘What became clear was that taxation was a topic that prisoners wanted further information on but there was very little support, if any to help them. ‘All prisoners have the right to tax planning to ensure they pay the correct amount of tax and receive tax refunds when due. Retout, who was released earlier this year, said he soon realised that 'many more' prisoners at the 1,284 capacity jail in south London were due rebates from the taxman (file picture) ‘Many people sent to prison were unaware that they may be entitled to significant tax refunds.’ Retout also provided an advice checklist for inmates to help them claim back any tax owed to them. As a result of the advice, it is now thought up to 200 prisoners have applied for tax rebates. One ex-prisoner, who wished to remain anonymous, said: ‘I've looked into my tax affairs and found I paid too much tax while in jail last year and am due a £800 rebate. ‘I had no idea that I could get a rebate and neither do most people in prison - when you're inside, you don't really think about tax.’ Retout was jailed for 16 months in October last year after he admitted submitting false invoices to his own firm, Quadrangle Group, where he was employed as financial controller. He was jailed after a hearing at Kingston Crown Court where he admitting committing fraud by abuse of position.","Accountant Paul Retout, 53, was jailed for £60,000 fraud in October last year .

"By . Daniel Martin . Ed Miliband claimed his party had 'done well' and was 'making progress' - but some feel Labour is floundering . Labour's ‘elitist and arrogant’ leaders have been attacked by their own MPs over their complacent reaction to the party’s dismal  election results. Ed Miliband claimed his party had ‘done well’ and was ‘making progress’ – despite being the first opposition leader in 30 years not to take first place in the European poll. But former Labour ministers said the party was ‘heading for catastrophe’ and was failing to tackle the Ukip threat or appeal to voters outside London. One said the European result was a  ‘terrible’ one, and that anyone in Mr  Miliband’s circle who believed it meant Labour was on course for a general election victory needed their ‘heads examining’. Others accused the party’s leadership of having their ‘pointy heads in the sand’ – and said Mr Miliband’s refusal to back a referendum on Europe was ‘untenable’. Labour finished second behind Ukip in the European Parliament elections, taking just over 25 per cent of the vote – marginally ahead of the Tories on 24 per cent. The local council results were also disappointing, with Labour winning 31 per cent of the vote to the Tories’ 29 per cent. Pollsters say an opposition leader wishing to win next year’s general election would need to be doing far better at this stage – with YouGov president Peter Kellner saying Labour should be ‘terrified’. But Mr Miliband, who will today visit Thurrock in Essex – the site of some of Ukip’s greatest victories – said Labour had ‘done well’ and again refused to hold an in/out referendum on Europe. ‘Labour made real progress in these elections, pushing the Tories into third place for the first time ever in a national election,’ he said. ‘I think we did well, from a party that in 2010 got one of its worst shares of the vote ever in an election. ‘In lots of the key areas that we need to win, Labour was actually winning. So I think that is a sign that Labour can win the general election.’ But one former minister responded by saying: ‘This is a terrible result for Labour. ‘If the people around Ed think they are on course for an election victory on this basis, they need their heads examined. ‘I’ve not met anyone on the doorstep who is saying anything warm about Ed Miliband at all. Whatever good ideas he may be having; people are not listening.’ ¿If the people around Ed think they are on course for an election victory on this basis, they need their heads examined,' said one former minister . The European results show Labour did better in the capital; comfortably topping the poll and taking four seats. But the former minister warned: ‘London has a larger proportion of people who vote for us, like ethnic minorities and the young, Labour is not appealing to ordinary men and women in the rest of Britain.’ Frank Field, who served as a social security minister under Tony Blair, said the Labour leadership was ‘in denial’ about Ukip. ‘We have to offer a referendum. Ordinary voters think Labour’s position is untenable,’ he said. ‘They think we’re shoving two  fingers up their nose. ‘We will have a catastrophe at the next election if we go on like this. ‘Our voters are trying to give us one last chance and tell us they want change. Ed Miliband has got to free himself from this or he will drag us down with him.’ Many Labour MPs complain the public thinks Ed Miliband is weird – while others said the failure to offer the public a referendum on EU membership was making Labour’s policies ‘unattractive’. Graham Stringer, MP for Blackley and Broughton, said the leadership was guilty of huge complacency in the face of the Ukip threat and called on Mr Miliband to change his tune on immigration and Europe. He said: ‘I think it’s very elitist and arrogant. While these elections were about Europe and there were certainly some protest votes, there were also some people voting against the direction this country is going in Europe. Unless we have a policy response to that, which has to be…a referendum, then we’re going to lose votes.’ John Mann, MP for Bassetlaw, tweeted: ‘Mmm, Labour official briefing calls results excellent. Pointy heads in the sand.’ Margaret Hodge, MP for Barking and Dagenham, previously warned about the dangers of ignoring the BNP and now believes the same may be happening with Ukip. The former minister said: ‘I think the lesson for Labour is that it can’t set the agenda for people’s lives from Westminster. We have to really listen…and really respond.’ Austin Mitchell, MP for Great Grimsby, said the leadership had not been listening to ordinary people. ‘The Labour Party is crazy not to call for a referendum,’ he said. He told the Morning Star: ‘We should have committed to an EU referendum before these elections.’ John Mills, Labour’s largest private donor and chairman of Labour for a Referendum, said: ‘People have clearly voted for parties offering a referendum on our membership of the EU. In some areas Ukip are taking Labour votes.’ A source close to Mr Miliband said the party was not going to try and ‘out-Ukip Ukip’ by offering a referendum. ‘This is the first time we have beaten the Conservatives for 20 years in Europe and the first time we have got more than 4million votes for 20 years,’ he said.","MIliband claims the party is 'doing well' even though it only just edged Tories .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A Chicago coffee expert has died after being crushed to death when a brewing machine he was trying to dismantle fell on him. Jim Karr was a popular coffee guru who had been director of brewing technology of the city's Intelligenstia for years. The 48-year-old had been trying to dismantle a . commercial-grade coffee maker after an outside event at the city when he was . crushed. Loss: Jim Karr died from serious injuries on Saturday after a coffee machine fell on top of him . Mr Karr, who had left Intelligenstia to set up his own coffee company - SteamVolt - died from serious head and chest injuries. An autopsy showed that he died from multiple injuries caused by being crushed. The death, which happened at a charity Bike the Drive event, has been ruled an accident, the Chicago Tribune . reported. Friends and former colleagues quickly paid tribute to Mr Karr, who they described as a 'legend and mentor to the entire specialty coffee community'. Jesse, of coffee company Dark Matter, described Mr Karr in a Facebook post as 'an inspiration' and added that he 'constantly ideated with me new ways for us to do both better'. 'Jim will be missed dearly, but his work will forever be lived out by the people he has touched in life,' the post added. It is believed some staff members of Dark Matter had been with Mr Karr at the time of the accident. Tragic: Jim, the founder of an innovative coffee company, was crushed as he packed up a machine at a Bike the Drive event in Chicago . Mr Karr was a well-known and popular figure in the coffee industry, with contacts as far afield as San Francisco paying tribute to him. Nicholas Cho, of Wrecking Ball Coffee Roaster in San Francisco, told DNAInfo Chicago: 'In terms of the work Jim did, he was one of the very few in the country that was known as being a top expert at what he did.' Trey Elder, who used to work with Mr Karr at Intelligentsia, added that he was known by everyone in the business, from the baristas to the sales teams. 'Most people that are serious about their coffee profession at some point ran into Jim,' Mr Elder said, adding that he had been quick-witted, quiet and kind-hearted. After seven years as Intelligenstia's . brewing director, Mr Karr had founded SteamVolt in 2012, which offered technical . support to coffee companies, and focused on innovation.","Jim Karr was trying to pack up a commercial-grade coffee maker .

"By . Tom Gardner . First: Mishal Husain, pictured, this morning became the first Muslim to present Radio 4's Today programme . The first Muslim journalist to present Radio 4’s flagship current affairs programme has vowed never to wear a veil. Mishal Husain - who joined the Today programme this morning - recalled the moment she was accosted by a fellow Muslim while boarding a train who told her she will soon have to adopt the face covering hijab. She said: ‘He complimented me on my work and then said, “But you’ll have to wear a hijab one day.” “I don’t think so,” I replied.’ The Cambridge-educated journalist, 40, . is the latest high-profile public figure to intervene in the debate . about whether the veil is an acceptable item of clothing in Britain. A row over the acceptability of full-face coverings was sparked last month when a Muslim defendant in a court case insisted on wearing the veil during her trial. In September, a judge ordered her to take off the garment to give evidence. But . the case made British legal history because Judge Peter Murphy said the . woman could retain the veil for all other parts of her trial. Last . month, David Cameron was accused of Islamophobia after he backed a . college’s controversial decision to ban pupils wearing the full facial . veil for security reasons. All . students, staff and visitors to Birmingham Metropolitan College were . told they must have their faces visible at all times so they are ‘easily . identifiable’. But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg . said he felt ‘uneasy’ about a veil ban in a schools, although he could . understand why it was needed to identify people at airport checkouts. Debate: BBC Radio 4 presenter Mishal Husain said she would not wear a veil when she was confronted by a fellow Muslim while boarding a train . Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt also joined the debate by declaring that he would not personally want to be treated by a doctor or nurse wearing a veil. The cabinet minister insisted patients should have the right to demand medics remove their veils. He said: ‘Certainly, if I was a patient myself, I’d want to be able to see the face of the doctor or nurse who was treating me. ‘I think it is very important that patients do get proper contact with the doctors and nurses who are looking after them.’ His comments, made last month, came as the Department of Health launched a review into NHS guidelines on full-face veils amid concerns they are preventing face-to-face contact in hospitals. Asked whether patients should be allowed to request not to be treated by someone wearing a veil, Mr Hunt said: ‘I do think this should be a professional and not a political matter and that’s why I think the people who should be pronouncing on this are the body responsible for professional standards and not politicians.’ Two Muslim students at the Birmingham Metropolitan College campus in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands. The college have banned Muslim girls from wearing a veil. Eyes, nose and mouth all have to be visible . Drawing from her own interpretation of . what the Koran said about the wearing of veils, Ms Husain said there . was no order to don the garment. In a diary piece for the Financial Times, . she said: ‘In the Koran, the subject of dress is touched upon only a . handful of times, with the dominant requirement being modesty on the . part of both sexes. ‘One . verse puts the emphasis on actions over appearances: “O children of . Adam, we have provided you with garments to cover your bodies, as well . as for luxury. But the best garment is the garment of righteousness.” (7:26) Ms Husain, who is also Today's first Asian presenter, said her determination not to wear the veil was formulated during her years as a child growing up in Saudi Arabia, where her mother was required to wear an abaya, or black cloak, over the top. She described how her young friends would sometimes struggle to pick out their mothers in a crowded shopping centre - as the full-face veil meant they had to look for details on their shoes to distinguish people. Mishal Husain, pictured right, was born in Northampton, in 1973 but two years later moved to the Middle East where her father practised as a doctor. After spending time in Saudi Arabia, she returned to the UK at the age of 12 to complete her education at Cobham Hall, an independent school in Cobham, Kent. Ms Husain went on to studied Law at New Hall, Cambridge, and then a Master's degree in International and Comparative Law at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy. Ms Husain began her journalistic career aged 18 in Islamabad at Pakistan's English-language newspaper The News. After two years at Bloomberg Television in London in 1996, where she was a producer and sometime presenter, she joined the BBC as a junior producer in the newsroom and for the News 24 channel. During her rise through the ranks, she had stints at the Economics and Business Unit, the daily Breakfast programme, on Asia Business Report (based in Singapore), and as a presenter of business news on both BBC World News and the BBC News Channel. From September 2002 she was the corporation's Washington correspondent, serving as the main news anchor through the buildup to the invasion of Iraq and during the war. She named as part of BBCs Olympic Presenting team and presented News at 10. In July she was announced as the first Muslim presenter of BBC Radio 4's Today programme and the show's second ever female achor.","Mishal Husain, 40, was told to cover her face by Muslim train passenger .

"By . Luke Augustus . Follow @@Luke_Augustus29 . Edwin van der Sar believes Manchester United's new goalkeeping coach Frans Hoek will be a success at Old Trafford. Hoek will join the Red Devils as part of imminent manager Louis van Gaal's coaching staff, alongside assistant coach Marcel Bout, once the Netherlands' World Cup campaign in Brazil is over this summer. The 57-year-old was Van der Sar's first goalkeeping coach at Ajax during the early 1990's, playing a crucial part in the Dutchman's development as the club won the Champions League in 1995. Support: Edwin van der Sar has backed Frans Hoek to succeed as Manchester United goalkeeping coach . In the dugout: Hoek (right) will move to United after the World Cup with boss Louis van Gaal (second left) Speaking to Manchester United's official club website, former fan favourite van der Sar gave his backing to Hoek's appointment. 'He groomed me and helped me learn all the things I needed to know to be a successful footballer over a lot of years,' he said. 'Like Louis van Gaal, he’s really exact with his exercises – they both put a lot of thought into them. He was one of the first guys I know who connected the goalkeepers with defenders and midfielders in terms of exercises. 'It wasn’t only about practicing goalkicks as a keeper – he would think about the different situations you might yourself be in during a game and try to find exercises and drills for us that he would combine with the outfield players."" Van der Sar also believes that current United number one David de Gea will only improve under Hoek. Young gun: Hoek was Van der Sar's first goalkeeping coach at Ajax during the early 1990's . Fans favourite: Van der Sar (right) made 264 appearances for United, winning 11 trophies during six seasons . De Gea, who has been selected for Spain's .

The 23-year-old's performances didn't go unnoticed though as he topped a fans' poll to win Player of the Year, while his team-mates voted him Players' Player of the Year in the end of season gongs. The former Atletico Madrid star's development should only continue to improve under Hoek according to van der Sar. Upward curve: Van der Sar believes United goalkeeper David de Gea's development will grow under Hoek . 'He should be a great help for David,' he added. 'He used to work at Barcelona so he’ll speak Spanish, which will help, although I know David speaks good English now. I think they’ll be a good combination. 'After a difficult start in his first year, David has developed himself brilliantly over the last three years and performed so well last season.'","Edwin van der Sar has backed new goalkeeping coach Frans Hoek to succeed at Manchester United .

Cellino met with the potential buyers, led by Italian businessman Luca Silvestrone, in Miami on Tuesday afternoon to finalise the agreement. The deal, worth a reported £69million is expected to be completed by the end of the week. Controversial: Cellino (right) tried to sack Leeds manager Brian McDermott (left) before he took charge . Moving on: Cellino has sold Cagliari for £69m but he has been frank about Leeds' financial problems . With Leeds thought to be losing £1m every month, and with daily running costs of £100,000 according the Cellino, the Italian was keen to offload Cagliari quickly. 'I am delighted,' Cellino told Gazzetta dello Sport. 'We have reached an agreement and we have signed a letter of intent that foresees their takeover of the club. 'Now they will have to fight with the (Italian) bureaucracy. Moving on: Cellino bought Cagliari in 1992 but has been pushing for a sale since he acquired Leeds United . 'I hope they will be allowed to do what I wasn't given permission to do (to build a new Cagliari stadium).' The Italian has proved extremely controversial since buying a 75 per cent stake in Leeds last month, with continued uncertainty over manager Brian McDermott's future after the arrival of Benito Carbone as 'special consultant to the board of directors'. He then named his sons, Edoardo and Ercole, as fellow directors of the Elland Road club. Leeds fans have also voiced their displeasure at his takeover through protests. Cellino bought Cagliari in 1992 but had been looking to sell the Sardinia-based outfit for several months. Should the sale go through, Cagliari would become the third Serie A club to be foreign-owned - Roma have been controlled by an American consortium since May 2011, while Indonesian tycoon Erick Thohir acquired Inter Milan last year. Cagliari finished 15th in Serie A, seven points clear of the drop zone.","Controversial Leeds owner Massimo Cellino seals deal with US investors .

Jagielka, who has finally recovered from a hamstring injury, has never been on the losing side for England in 10 starts alongside Gary Cahill. Nevertheless, there had been calls for Terry, who retired from international duty in September 2012, to make himself available for Brazil. Blues brothers: Everton pair Phil Jagielka and John Stones train with England at St George's Park . Thumbs up: Jagielka looked in good spirits as England prepared for Friday's friendly with Peru . The Everton centre half admitted: 'It's difficult. I can't say I like to hear it, but I understand why I do. 'Obviously Cahill and Terry play together at Chelsea, they play in the Champions League and were contenders to win the Premier League. 'As a defender, partnerships are important. If you have two players who work well together they may be a better bet than two superior players, so I can understand why people talk about Terry. 'England's defence in the qualifiers was pretty decent, but I can't decide what people ask. I stop, smile and get on with it.' Terry, 33, has always insisted he would never come out of international retirement and head coach Roy Hodgson hasn't even discussed it with him. First choice: Jagielka and Gary Cahill look the likely to be the centre back pairing for England at the World Cup . Club class: Cahill and John Terry have formed a defensive partnership at Chelsea . Although England's defence does look vulnerable, Jagielka and Cahill will be Hodgson's first pick at the World Cup this summer. The Everton defender has won 31 caps and is expected to face Peru in England's World Cup send-off at Wembley on Friday evening. He added: 'I still find it difficult assuming I'm going to play for England but I've played quite a lot in qualifying and have built up a good relationship with Cahill. 'We haven't played together for a while and hopefully these three games will give us the chance to get that relationship going again. Being in the squad is great, but nothing beats starting games for your country. It's what we all want to do and it looks like I've got a good chance of doing that at the moment.' Getting down to business: England players Joe Hart and Jagielka try and stop Raheem Sterling from scoring . Jagielka also mounted an impassioned defence of young English footballers after monitoring the progress of Everton midfielder Ross Barkley, plus Raheem Sterling and Luke Shaw this season. The England defender watched Barcelona striker Gerard Deulofeu on loan at Everton last season and claims he is no better than young English players. He added: 'Gerard came in and he was quite a selfish player but he has a tremendous amount of ability and went past people. We are probably taught to be less selfish but technically there is no difference. Young stars: Raheem Sterling and Gerard Deulofeu both had good seasons on Merseyside . 'The ideal comparison is Raheem to Deulofeu and for me Raheem had the best season. That is a direct comparison. 'It is too easy to point the finger but if you take a step back to what we have got, we have some tremendously talented individuals. 'If you look at Ross, he has a good physique, is good in the air, eats the right food, and more importantly loves the game. You cannot get him off the training ground. He had a couple of injuries when he was younger which set him back a bit and he did not get to play that much football because he was not around the first team at a young age. Looking good: Ross Barkley is one of the young England stars picked for the World Cup . 'This season has proved how much he has grown mentally. He went through a bad period but the manager stood by him and he came out of it. He has got the whole package, but we don't want to put too much pressure on him. 'People compare him to Wayne Rooney but they are not the same players. In terms of mindset, they are the same.' Jagielka missed three months of the season with a hamstring injury, but finally returned to the Everton team for the 3-2 defeat against Manchester City on May 3. He added: 'I don't feel 100 per cent sharp but training with these extra layers on is perfect. I can only improve and hopefully if I can get some time on the pitch in these three games I'll soon be a lot fitter.'","Phil Jagielka confident he and Gary Cahill will be able to fill the void left by John Terry .

The Sale fly-half’s flight plan included further exploration of the power of instinctive thought. The book in his carry-on bag for the long-haul journey is another minor element of the 26-year-old’s career revival strategy — fine-tuned with the help of Jonny Wilkinson’s long-term mentor, Steve Black. So, as the first contingent of England’s squad hurtled across the time zones to New Zealand, Cipriani intended to peruse more words of wisdom. ‘I’m about a third of the way through a book called Blink, by Malcolm Gladwell,’ he said, after explaining a recent reading habit. ‘It’s about going with your instinctive decisions rather than taking the time to think and then  trying to adjust, because about 90 per cent of the time our instincts are  correct. You can take things out of it and apply it to rugby in terms of how you want to play, your decision-making, things like that. It keeps your mind occupied and working.’ Back in the picture: Danny Cipriani flew out to New Zealand with the England squad on Tuesday . Made his point: Cipriani issues orders during England training at the Lensbury Club earlier this month . Black . sets Cipriani various tasks, such as keeping a daily journal and . reading books, then discussing the contents. The intention is to occupy . his mind and make him think — in this case, ironically, think about not . thinking too much. Both . mentor and pupil will recognise the fact that the gifted No 10 has not . always been well served by his instincts but they have been more . reliable for the past year and more. Cipriani has spoken of how a . drunken night out in Leeds last April served as a tipping point. The . shock of being rushed to hospital after being hit by a bus convinced him . finally to make the most of a talent which had been in danger of going . to waste. The decision to . seek assistance from Black last summer was the first step towards a . profound transformation. The upshot has been a season of consistent form . at his improving club and enough evidence of enhanced commitment and . defensive resilience that an international recall which had seemed a . distant prospect has now come to pass. ‘I . knew I had to make some changes, to get my head down and do it the . rugby way,’ said Cipriani. ‘That came probably in April last year. I . started to work with Steve and I made the conscious decision that I . wanted to put my head down and really go for it. ‘I’ve . had quite an enjoyable 12-15 months since then and it was always the . dream, always the goal to get back in the England squad. Fortunately . enough, I have the chance to go to New Zealand and hopefully I’ll . represent my country again.’ This . is a player with a high profile who attracts strident preconceptions . and polarises opinion. But there is a sense that the penny has dropped. Maturity has seized Cipriani and pointed him towards the virtues of . selfless hard graft and modest professionalism. Having played his way . back into the England squad, he is hell-bent on showing team-mates, . coaches and the public his altered nature and determination to make best . use of his ability. Hitting form: Cipriani has impressed for Sale in the Aviva Premiership during the last 12 months . Bon voyage: Cipriani (left) posted a picture alongside Kyle Eastmond on the flight to New Zealand . Asked . if he relished this chance to change perceptions, he said: ‘Definitely, . especially off the field. I want to give the best example of myself that . I can over the next month and show them that I want to be an England . rugby player more than anything. That’s my goal.’ England . in the Stuart Lancaster era have a revived streak of humility at their . core. There are those who would question how a player often regarded as . brash and self-centred could fit into a set-up where the emphasis is so . emphatically on national pride and the common cause. Yet, Cipriani rejects the notion that he must change to gain acceptance. ‘I feel like that has always been me,’ he said. ‘To . come into this environment, I’ve got so much learning and catching up . to do, I’ve not really got time to focus on anything else. I know I’m . not first-choice here so humility has to come with that immediately. But . I know where I want to be.’ Exile: Cipriani has not played for England since Martin Johnson was manager in 2008 . Lifeline: Stuart Lancaster is the first England coach to pick Cipriani in almost six years . Where . he wants to be is in the Test No 10 shirt — not just as a temporary . stand-in, but when Lancaster has everyone available, unlike in Auckland . next weekend when Owen Farrell, Stephen Myler and George Ford will all . be out of contention. Even without those more established rivals to . usurp, Cipriani is destined to play second fiddle to Freddie Burns. He . will have to fight tooth and nail for a chance to add to the tally of . seven caps he won in 2008, but he has the hunger to do so and knows that . the satisfaction will be all the greater if he makes it. ‘You . don’t want it to be an easy ride,’ he said. ‘When it is tough, you have . to keep working at it and there are obstacles to overcome, that’s when . you feel like you have achieved something.’ To . reach this point has been an achievement in itself. For so long, it . felt as if Cipriani’s face didn’t fit; that he was a maverick who . couldn’t be trusted. Clearing that hurdle has been the hardest part. Now . he is in the England system again, his chance will surely come to prove . that his instincts are suitably reliable these days. Explosive impact: Cipriani looked to be a world-class star in the making during his early days with England .

"By . David Kent . Every day Sportsmail takes a look at the European papers to see what are the biggest stories creating talking points on the continent. Vicente del Bosque turned down the chance to succeed David Moyes as Manchester United manager and was offered the job before Louis van Gaal, according to reports in the Spanish press. The veteran Spain boss was nominated as the first-choice replacement for the sacked Scot by Sir Alex Ferguson and the Red Devils made their approach in April, according to AS. But the 63-year-old former Real Madrid boss reportedly would not even consider talking to the club, and instead has signed a new deal to extend his time in charge of the Spanish national team until after Euro 2016. Revelations: Vicente del Bosque's rejection of Manchester United over their manager's job (left) and Barcelona's interest in Marquinhos (right) are the big news in the Spanish press on Wednesday morning . United have since confirmed that Van Gaal will be their new boss following the World Cup in Brazil this summer. But AS also report that the Dutchman was only one of three names on United's shortlist, along with Del Bosque and Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone. Del Bosque could have made vastly more money by taking charge of United, but apparently refused even to entertain the approach. Madrid president Florentino Perez had claimed on Tuesday that Manchester United wanted Carlo Ancelotti to take over from Ferguson last year. Speaking on Spanish radio, Perez suggested Ferguson only chose Moyes after Ancelotti told him he was replacing Jose Mourinho at the Bernabeu. Meanwhile, Mundo Deportivo are reporting that Barcelona have offered Paris Saint-Germain £16million plus Dani Alves for Marquinhos. The super-rich French club, who are set to sign David Luiz from Chelsea in a huge deal, have reportedly rebuffed the offer and instead want £24.5m plus Alves before they consider a deal for the 20-year-old Brazilian centre-half. Barcelona have also been told they will need to splash out for Roma defender Mehdi Benatia. The Moroccan defender had a hugely impressive debut season as Roma finished second in Serie A and has attracted interested from Barca, Manchester City and United. But Roma have told any potential suitors that the 27-year-old will cost them £32m, according to Italian daily Il Romanista. Read all about it: Il Romanista featured Mehdi Benatia (left) while L'Equipe focused on France's victory (right) In France, L'Equipe hailed Les Bleus' 4-0 friendly win over Norway as 'giving life' to the national side's World Cup campaign. Olivier Giroud scored twice, while Loic Remy and Paul Pogba also found the net as Didier Deschamps' men saw off the Norwegians with ease. And the result has seemingly left France upbeat ahead of the tournament in Brazil.","Vicente del Bosque turned down Manchester United job after David Moyes was sacked, according to Spanish press .

"By . Matt Lawton . Follow @@Matt_Lawton_DM . Craig Bellamy would be the first to admit there were times in his career as a footballer when he was utterly dislikeable. He was talented, of course, the success he enjoyed in tandem with Alan Shearer at Newcastle earning him the PFA’s young player of the year award in 2002. But Shearer also found him irritating — extremely irritating. In fairness to Bellamy, he wasn’t too fond of himself either at times, to the point — as he said in his quite brilliant autobiography where he struggled to watch a recording of himself playing football. ‘I hate it,’ he says. ‘I hate watching how I confront the referee. I don’t like that side of me.’ Game over: Cardiff forward has announced his retirement from football aged 34 . Fans' favourite: Bellamy, pictured here playing for Wales against Macedonia, represented his country on 78 occasions . Danger man: Bellamy celebrates scoring against Aston Villa for Manchester City in October, 2009 . In a senior career that spanned 18 years and nine clubs, among them Manchester City, Liverpool, Celtic and his beloved Cardiff City, controversy was too often his companion. When he tells the story of attacking John Arne Riise with an eight iron, he sounds like Joe Pesci in Goodfellas; Goodfella rather curiously also being the title of Bellamy’s book. It was, he concedes, the behaviour of a ‘madman’, someone who rather disturbingly concluded that he had been ‘disrespected’ in front of his team-mates because Riise responded to persistent requests to sing a song one night during a training camp in Portugal by  losing his rag and saying no. There was no insult. The Norwegian said he had ‘simply had enough’ of Bellamy ‘banging on about it’. Bellamy stopped short of pulling out a revolver and shooting Riise there and then. But he did go to his room later that evening and whack him with the golf club before issuing a few threats of what might also be coming his way should he complain to the Liverpool management. Bellamy at least deserves credit for the honest account he provides of the incident, coupled with the following admission: ‘I look back at what I did now and I cringe. It was pathetic. It was drunken,  bullying behaviour.’ With the help of Steve Peters, the much-respected sports psychiatrist, the combustible Bellamy has worked hard to reform. But beyond focusing on the fall-outs and football, on the 135 goals he scored in 452 league appearances, we should perhaps trust the judgment of those who know Bellamy best. Back of the net: Bellamy scores one of his 169 career goals for Newcastle against Everton . Dream come true: Bellamy shows off his Cardiff shirt after signing for the Welsh side on loan in August, 2010 .

You can certainly judge a man by the company he keeps and among his best friends in football are  Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher. And few players were as close as Bellamy to the late Gary Speed, as classy a man as you could wish to meet in football. Gerrard, together with Mark Hughes, wrote the foreword to Bellamy’s book. On hearing that Bellamy was joining Liverpool in 2006, Gerrard said he was expecting a ‘bit of a hothead’ and ‘someone who was more interested in being a footballer rather than actually living like one’. But Gerrard’s view changed once he got to know Bellamy. ‘I was totally wrong,’ he admitted. ‘It surprised me how professional he was and how much he loved the game. He ended up being a terrific ally for me at Liverpool as well as becoming a good friend.’ The sentiment is echoed by Carragher. ‘He is right up there with the best Welsh players of his generation and beyond,’ Carragher wrote in these pages. ‘He expects the highest standards from those around him and certainly isn’t afraid to say if he feels someone has fallen short. ‘He had problems with certain players and managers during his career because of his character but I loved him.’ Bellamy loved Speed, and the death of . the Wales manager had a profound effect on him. It made him re-evaluate . his life and seek the help of Peters, a man he credits with making him . the person he is, someone who feels equipped to pursue a career in . management.

In the swing: Bellamy celebrates a goal for Liverpool against Barcelona with a golf-themed celebration in 2007 . ‘When I started talking to Steve Peters in the aftermath of Speedo’s death, I thought my life wasn’t going to get better when I finished playing football. My life was going to be dark. ‘If I hadn’t started seeing Steve, if I hadn’t begun to change, my people skills — or lack of them —would have destroyed my chances of being a successful manager.’ On the last page of his book, he writes of how Speed’s death forced him to look at himself. ‘If I hadn’t done that, I don’t know what would have happened,’ he says. Most moving, however, are the final few lines. ‘I think differently now,’ he says. ‘Be thankful for what you’ve done. Keep trying hard. And don’t ruin your life. I did that for too long.’ Even now, there are episodes that will make him reflect and cringe. But he should listen to his peers and, indeed, be thankful for what he did on a football pitch.

"By . Dominic King . Follow @@DominicKing_DM . It's Saturday, August 16, 2014. As should be the case in the middle of summer, the weather is glorious and Anfield is humming with anticipation ahead of the new season. The fixture list has presented Liverpool with a potentially tricky opening day assignment against Leicester City, who have strengthened their squad with experience and talent and are determined to get off to a sound start on the back of winning the Championship. But on the back of a campaign in which they were only just pipped by Manchester City in the race for the Barclays Premier League, Liverpool have lofty ambitions of their own – not least after Brendan Rodgers enjoyed success in the transfer window… . VIDEO Scroll down to watch Liverpool targets Xherdan Shaqiri and Emre Can . Here to stay: Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has signed a new long-term contract at Anfield . So now begins the guessing game, a chance to play Fantasy Manager: who would be in your team if you could pick the starting line-up for the opening contest? A lot of the names who Liverpool want are out there already. Adam Lallana, Southampton’s England international, is a prime target but negotiations will take time, as his club want £30million, given they owe 25 per cent of whatever transfer fee they receive to Bournemouth. Bayern Munich’s Xherdan Shaqiri is an alternative to Lallana. A bid has been made for a 22-year-old who has found starts hard to come by at the Allianz Arena; another player with links to Munich, Emre Can, a highly-regarded 21-year-old who spent last season at Bayer Leverkusen, is coveted. Future team-mates? Adam Lallana (right) trains with Glen Johnson at the England training camp in Portugal . Being watched: Bayern Munich midfielder Xherdan Shaqiri (right) trains with Switzerland in Weggis ahead of the World Cup as national team coach Ottmar Hitzfeld looks on . On the radar: Bayern Leverkusen midfielder Emre Can (right) is a Liverpool target . Liverpool, however, are not just looking to bolster their midfield. Sevilla left-back Alberto Moreno, rated at £15million, is being closely monitored, along with Ryan Bertrand, the former England Under-21 international who has returned to Chelsea. A central defender is also on the list, which is not a surprise given that Liverpool shipped 50 goals last season – the rickety back line is the reason Rodgers’ side were unable to become champions, a point proven by them conceding three goals on six occasions. Dejan Lovren, the imposing Southampton central defender who enjoyed an outstanding first year in the Premier League, is admired by Liverpool, while Steven Caulker – a player with whom Rodgers worked when he was at Swansea – is also being considered. Eye on the ball: £15m-rated Sevilla left-back Alberto Moreno (right) trains with Spain near Madrid on Monday . Closely followed: Chelsea's Ryan Bertrand (centre) is being monitored by Liverpool . There will, of course, be others but the identities will be known only by Rodgers and his inner circle. Clearly, this is going to be a busy couple of months for Rodgers, who has extended his own stay at Anfield after being given assurances he can compete at the top end of the transfer market, and his recruitment team, as the squad is not how he wants it to be. Rodgers’ ambition during the close season is to add players with hunger and drive. Liverpool’s ethos is to find players who are on the rise, with the appetite to prove themselves at the highest level, rather than going out to sign ‘ready-made’ stars. ‘The owners have shown me an unswerving commitment to what I want to do and that gives you confidence,’ Rodgers explained before Liverpool played Manchester United in March. Once you put your ideas in place and once the players start to crack it then we will have success. Warm welcome: Southampton defender Dejan Lovren is preparing for the World Cup with Croatia . History: Cardiff defender Steven Caulker (front) worked with Rodgers during his loan period at Swansea . ‘Money can’t buy that. Teams spend a billion quid and it does not guarantee anything. We will be in the market for good and top players but there is more to it than that. It is about coaching and man management; dealing with people, having a great staff, finding a cause for the players to fight for. ‘All of that comes into it and that is something we have done in the period I have been here. We are starting to find momentum now and we hope it continues. The money is great and we will be in the market to compete but what is important is having a vision of how you want the club to progress.’ With that in mind, then, this is Sportmail’s guess at Liverpool’s line-up for the opening weekend (4-1-3-2): . Simon Mignolet . Glen Johnson, Martin Skrtel, Dejan Lovren, Jon Flanagan . Steven Gerrard . Jordan Henderson, Adam Lallana, Raheem Sterling . Daniel Sturridge, Luis Suarez . How does yours compare?

Sources in Denmark claim that contact has been made with Laudrup’s representatives to assess his willingness to talk. He was assisted at the Barclays Premier League side by former Celtic midfielder Morten Wieghorst, who could form part of a potential coaching team at Parkhead. Double act: Will Michael Laudrup (left) be united with Morten Wieghorst at Celtic? It’s believed the Scottish champions have been taking informal soundings from a number of potential candidates as they try and refine their options following Neil Lennon’s departure. Malky Mackay, Owen Coyle, Oscar Garcia, Henrik Larsson, Steve Clarke and Wigan boss Uwe Rosler are among the other names to have been linked with the club, with Laudrup now adding an intriguing possibility to the list. The 49-year-old is well versed about life in Glasgow through younger brother Brian, who achieved legendary status during his playing days with Rangers. Laudrup guided Swansea to the League Cup during his time in charge - with a 5-0 victory over Bradford City at Wembley in 2013 - but was sacked in February of this year with his team sitting 12th in the Barclays Premier League. He reached a settlement with the Welsh club over his dismissal earlier this week. Winning pedigree: Laudrup won the Capital One Cup with Swansea in 2013 . Spanish club Granada already want him as their new manager but the one-time Barcelona and Real Madrid forward has yet to commit to the struggling La Liga outfit as he assesses his options. It remains to be seen whether Celtic will now enter into negotiations with Laudrup or first opt for another candidate. Capped 104 times by Denmark in a glittering playing career that also included a spell at Juventus, Laudrup is known for favouring an attacking brand of football. He began his management career with Brondby, enjoying league and cup success in his homeland before joining Getafe. Laudrup steered them to a Copa Del Rey final and a decent UEFA Cup run, with less successful stints at Spartak Moscow and Real Mallorca preceding his arrival at Swansea.

"By . Andrew Downie, Reuters . Brazilian health and safety officials have raided the England and Italy team hotels for next month's World Cup and confiscated fish, butter, ham and other food past their sell-by dates. More than 50 kilograms of food deemed unfit for consumption was taken from the Portobello Hotel where Italy will stay and another 2kg was removed from England's Hotel Royal Tulip. Both hotels are in Rio de Janeiro. As part of a wider campaign by the 'State Secretariat for the Defense and Protection of Consumers', officials visited 13 restaurants, supermarkets, bakeries, shops and hotels, and notified eight of them for irregularities. Base: The Royal Tulip Hotel in Rio de Janeiro will host the England team during the World Cup . Wish you were here? The view of Rio's famous Copacabana beach from the hotel . Smart: The dining room at the Royal Tulip Hotel, where the England team could eat during the tournament . 'In total, 218kg of food unfit for consumption was discarded,' the Secretariat said in a statement. One of the biggest raids came on Monday at Italy's hotel in Mangaratiba, just outside the city of Rio. Officials there discovered 25kg of seafood and margarine past the sell by date, and another 24kg of meat, sauces, cheese and sugar that had no visible sell-by date. They also removed 2.6kg of salmon, parma ham and butter after visiting England's hotel. Both hotels were also warned for not providing condoms to guests, as is required under Brazilian law. Agents also visited the Hotel Caesar Park where the Netherlands squad will be based but found no irregularities there.

Only one other team – Holland, who will train much closer to their hotel – are based in the city, while Germany have built their own private beach resort to stay in.

"By . Joe Bernstein . Since 1966 only two players based in England have won the World Cup as starters in the final - Emmanuel Petit (Arsenal) and Frank Leboeuf (Chelsea), who were members of the France side that beat Brazil 3-0 in 1998. But all that could change this summer with three Chelsea players - Ramires, Willian and Oscar - in Felipe Scolari’s squad for favourites Brazil. It would have been four but David Luiz has agreed to sign for Paris Saint-Germain. The first Samba connection at Stamford Bridge came when the club appointed Scolari as manager in 2008. But he was sacked after eight months after falling out with a number of influential players, including John Terry, Didier Drogba  and Frank Lampard.

Favourites: Chelsea trio Oscar, Willian (right) and Ramires (left) have a good chance of lifting the World Cup . Former Blue: Luiz Felipe Scolari's spell as Chelsea boss lasted just six months after he was sacked in February 2009 . Now the second wave of Brazilian influence has proved far more successful. Ramires was signed from Benfica in 2010 after he had been Brazil’s stand-out player at that year’s World Cup in South Africa. It was his goal in Barcelona that helped Chelsea gain an unlikely result to reach the Champions League final in 2012, which they won. In the past few years, Roman Abramovich’s Brazilian revolution has gathered pace. Luiz signed from Benfica at the start of 2011 and immediately became a cult figure among Chelsea fans. Oscar arrived from Internacional for £25million in 2012 and Abramovich gazumped Spurs to sign Willian nearly a year ago. With Jose Mourinho now back in charge and seeking a more pragmatic approach, the influence of Brazil may wane in coming seasons. Oscar and Luiz did not feature towards the end of last season - and now Luiz is leaving. Even so, Chelsea may yet be about to have a trio of World Cup winners on their hands.

"By . Jonathan McEvoy . The two characters that have set the Formula One season alight are ideally drawn for dramatic effect: Englishman Lewis Hamilton, the fastest driver of his generation yet emotionally vulnerable, against the German Nico Rosberg, only a fraction slower but ice cool in his calculation. The stewards cleared Rosberg of deliberately thwarting Hamilton’s final qualifying lap at the Monaco Grand Prix by running off the track at Mirabeau corner. Rosberg started from pole, won the race and took the championship lead off Hamilton. But if Rosberg did know what he was doing — as many, though not all, paddock observers believe — it was a crime perpetrated with so much forethought and so immaculately executed that it is hard not to equate Rosberg to the sort of villain who strokes a white cat on his lap. Frosty: Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg's relations were strained at a controversial Monaco Grand Prix . His answers to the press, and . seemingly to the stewards, were more coolly convincing than Michael . Schumacher’s in similar circumstances, when he ‘parked’ on the racing . line in qualifying eight years ago to block Fernando Alonso’s crack at . pole. Rosberg’s father, Keke, who was world champion in 1982, famously . called Schumacher ‘a cheap cheat’ for his skulduggery. Even . more impressively, Rosberg refused to be ruffled by Hamilton’s . simmering anger at press conferences after qualifying and after the . race. He said calmly that he and Hamilton are friends; Hamilton said . emphatically they weren’t. It may have irked Hamilton that his insinuations were met with serene indifference. Fire, in this instance, could not melt ice. They . managed not to speak on the night of the race. Rosberg and his fiancee, . Vivian, left the gala dinner on Sunday to arrive at the Amber Lounge at . 1.15am to party with about 20 friends and 15 mechanics. They were . briefly joined by Bayern Munich footballer David Alaba and ended the . celebrations at breakfast time on the terrace at Le Meridien. Hamilton was also at the Amber Lounge, but his table was a diplomatically long way from Rosberg’s. Blanked: Hamilton and Rosberg did not talk to or look at each other on the podium in Monte Carlo . Contract: Rosberg leapfrogged Hamilton to the top of the standings after his win in Monaco . Rosberg . clearly has a steeliness that belies the coiffured blond locks that won . him the nickname Britney, as in Spears, from his fellow drivers. His . manner with those of us he deals with on a professional basis is cordial . but not matey. He is self-assured and self-possessed. Interviewing . him earlier in the season in the back of his Mercedes, I was twiddling . with a pen and it snapped in my hand. He said: ‘Are you nervous?’ It . seemed a typical Rosberg comment, a half-joke but one with a point. On . that Thursday, the first of the four-day grand prix weekend, he arrived . early at the track. His driver parked up in an empty car park and . Rosberg started work with his engineers, knowing his cerebral approach — . he turned down a place to study engineering at Imperial College — . offers the best, possibly the only, way to beat Hamilton to the title. Feud: Hamilton was unhappy at the way Rosberg achieved his pole position on Saturday . Mercedes . chairman Niki Lauda admitted as much, seeing in  Rosberg’s attention to . detail something of his own approach. Hamilton he described as quicker . and more naturally gifted. Ah, . Hamilton. He is brilliant yet brittle. That is the view of a former . karting rival of Hamilton and Rosberg, Dutchman Giedo van der Garde, . formerly of Caterham but now a test driver at Sauber. He has placed a . bet on Rosberg winning the title on the basis the German has the mental . fortitude that Hamilton lacks. Bernie Ecclestone, possibly the best judge of a driver, said at the start of the season that he thought Rosberg would prevail. But . Hamilton’s former McLaren team-mate, Jenson Button, has backed his . fellow Briton to recover for the next race in Montreal a week on Sunday. Speaking from experience, he said: ‘Lewis would arrive at the next race . after an upset very quiet, then go out and blitz it. He will do the . same in  Canada — he will probably be untouchable in Canada.’ Upset: During an interview after the race, Hamilton said he and Nico are not friends . An . important factor in deciding who wins the title is how Hamilton will . fare without his father Anthony’s daily presence. He has not won a title . at any level without him as his manager. He was the one person who . would fight for his son against the world. In . Anthony’s absence, Mercedes must make Lewis feel loved if he is to . perform at his best. That is not easy because when they put their two . drivers on different strategies, and Hamilton perceives Rosberg’s is the . better one, his frustrations — paranoia even — could devour him. The . other control Anthony had over his son was in ensuring he was not . distracted by off-track glamour: rappers, life in LA, the red carpet. Perhaps those factors have provided balance to Hamilton’s life, made him . more rounded and worldly, but there remains the possibility that he . could be drawn too often to those sirens. Much, . therefore, falls on Lauda, whose words after the race were refreshing. He knows he cannot stop his drivers feuding — there is too much at stake . for that — but he can draw a line which they must not cross. He has . said they must be just about civil towards each other and not drive each . other off the track. Thirsty work: The Brit has won four of the six races this season, but still trails Rosberg in the drivers' standings . Flashback: Hamilton and Rosberg together during their younger days . This . rivalry is precisely what  Formula One needed. Suddenly it makes no odds . that Mercedes are so far ahead because the championship fight is . perfectly distilled into a mano a mano fight, with two-thirds of the . season to go. One regret: the BBC did not show the Monaco Grand Prix live, a deprivation for the casual,  non-Sky audience. Sky . show all races live, the BBC then pick the three races they most want . to show live. They selected the British Grand Prix, the Canadian Grand . Prix — because it is at peak viewing time — and the last race, Abu . Dhabi, as it could be the title-decider. Sky . then choose three races that they do not want the BBC to get their . hands on. Monaco, along with the other potential deciders, Brazil and . the United States, were on that list. It is a shame because we have a 21st century answer to the Senna-Prost rivalry unfolding before us. FERNANDO ALONSO  v LEWIS HAMILTON . Alonso, the champion, demanded No 1 status over Hamilton at McLaren in 2007. It was denied him. NELSON PIQUET  v NIGEL MANSELL . Piquet called his 1986 and 1987 Williams team-mate ‘an uneducated blockhead with a stupid and ugly wife’. ALAIN PROST v AYRTON SENNA . The two star drivers regularly collided on the track. Prost said they made up before Senna died. NIKI LAUDA v JAMES HUNT . Lauda was given the last rites after a crash in Monza; he came back but lost the 1976 title in the final race.

"By . Chris Foy . Follow @@FoyChris . He tried to enjoy it all, he really did. Jonny Wilkinson was a picture of serene fulfilment as he raised the Heineken Cup alongside his jubilant Toulon team-mates, but the personal acclaim still jarred. As the iconic Toulon No 10 was buried under an avalanche of goodwill and adulation, he struggled - as ever - to cope with all the individual recognition. Not only that, but the 34-year-old could not just relax and savour his triumph because he had already started fretting over the next challenge. That will be the last challenge of his career - the French Top 14 final in Paris on Saturday. Only once that is over can Wilkinson finally try to turn off the tap of obsessive, competitive intensity. Until then, tributes will just bounce off his  protective super-hero’s shield. Hero: Wilkinson lifted the trophy, but, as ever, praised the players around him for the success . In the closing stages of this European showpiece, the Millennium Stadium staged an epic love-in in Wilkinson’s name. Banners around the stadium hailed ‘Sir Jonny’ and even nominated him as a potential president of France. His last goal-kicks in this country, complete with familiar crouch and clasped hands, brought flashes from thousands of camera-phones. His words of praise for his team’s collective effort after the final whistle were drowned out by chants of ‘Jonny, Jonny’. As ever, Wilkinson found the hero-worship distinctly uncomfortable. Scorer: The former England fly-half kicked 13 points as Toulon comfortably saw off Saracens . ‘I make no secret of the fact that I have been over-supported,’ said Wilkinson. ‘I have been given way too much respect. I am a bit of a fraud in that respect. 'I am lucky enough to be around great individuals and great teams. These are the guys who make the difference, yet it is not they who get cheered at the end like I did. ‘It has been amazing. There are too many people who have given too much to me in my life. If I thought about it, emotionally it would be too difficult to take. 'Just add to that list today, guys being so generous and kind to me. When guys go out of the way to cheer for you it’s humbling.’ For Wilkinson, the climax of this final soon gave way to thoughts about the next one - against Castres at the Stade de France five days from now. Even during the lap of honour, Wilkinson was wrestling with the nagging dread that another all-consuming ordeal lay ahead. After that, he must come to terms with an end to the draining weekly ritual. Fraud: Wilkinson claims he has always been over-supported and sees himself as a fraud . Having joked that the world of celebrity reality TV was not for him, England’s World Cup-winning  fly-half said: ‘I’d like to take a little time out to realise where I am. Maybe I’ll have the opportunity just to relax a little and say, “Look, it’s not do-or-die from now on”. ‘I’ve lived for 17 years where every weekend of your life hangs in the balance.It might be nice that that’s no longer the case. 'Maybe I can wake up on Saturday mornings and not have that horrible feeling in your stomach and not have to worry about all the what-ifs.’ Solid: Wilkinson's brilliance throughout his career came not just from the tee, but also from his rock-solid tackling . Wilkinson gave the crowd what they craved with 13 points courtesy of two penalties, a drop goal and two touchline conversions, after tries by Matt Giteau and Juan Smith. In reality, those two, along with Steffon Armitage, had a greater impact on the result than Wilkinson did. Saracens were pounded into submission and all attempts to match the brute force of their opponents foundered on the breakdown-spoiling work of Toulon No 8 Armitage. His man-of-the-match exploits once again revived the debate about England’s policy to ignore him as an overseas exile. Delight: Juan Smith, who scored Toulon's second try, was instrumental in their win . Bryan Habana argued that his team-mate’s continuing Test omission was a major mistake: ‘I think (England coach) Stuart Lancaster and the selectors are ruing their decision not to pick overseas-based players. He has really been phenomenal for us. ‘He gets vital turnovers. We also scored a try with his hands involved. People look at his body shape and his height and write him off at their own peril. He has been absolutely wonderful. 'After the season he has had, Steffon probably deserves to be playing international rugby.’ 'There were tributes, too, from Saracens. Brad Barritt said: ‘He was an absolute menace. So many times we were on the front foot and he somehow got his good frame into a good shape to steal the ball.’ Call-up: Armitage powers through a tackle in a performance that Habana says should earn him an England call . Billy Vunipola added: ‘He deserved to be man of the match. We could have done better to stop him but fair play to him.’ Fair play to him, to Wilkinson and to Toulon. What they did was not pretty but it was mighty effective in ensuring they retained their title. One more almighty effort and they can cap their playmaker’s glittering career with a glorious Double. On the way: Matt Giteau scored the first try after a brilliant switch pass by Jonny Wilkinson . As for Saracens, they will go to Twickenham for Saturday’s Aviva Premiership final in ‘wounded-beasts’ mode to face a Northampton team on a roll after their Amlin Challenge Cup success. They want something to show for an impressive campaign. ‘We will take a day or two to digest this defeat and hurt from it, then we will prepare to fight,’ said  Barritt. ‘We are desperate to finish the season with a trophy.’","Jonny Wilkinson finishes his European cup career with win .

Cool new look: Made In Chelsea's Louise Thompson models the edgy new range of clothes from her Pocket London brand . The design duo met on holiday in 2007 and came up with the idea over lunch. 'Edward . had the idea a while back but as we had university commitments we . didn’t act on it,' Louise told MailOnline. 'We were having lunch together and by . the end we had decided to start a jeans line. We had no name or . anything; we just had the concept of having a different colour pocket.' Extended range: The range started off as colourful jeans range and has now expanded to include printed tees and slogan jumpers . Vibrant: The brand is famed for its brightly coloured trousers and Edward and Louise have added more relaxed culotte style trousers, as well as jeans . Edward added: 'Neither of us had prior design experience, so we had to go with our instinct. 'Louise . knows a lot about the fashion world already and I have always trusted . my taste. So between us we were confident we could take the brand in a . certain direction, and off the beaten track in the jeans world.' It seemed their gamble paid off: Pocket London, which is sold at TnT Showroom, Wolf & Badger and Natasha Coote, has become so successful and demand is so great that the duo are adding new styles, such as jumpsuits, as well as exciting new prints. Brains behind the brand: Louise and Edward have been friends since 2007 when they met on holiday and thought up the idea over lunch one day . 'There are many exciting projects on the horizon such SS15 The Spirit of London collection with the help of Maya Finkelstein Amrami, which is set to be sold worldwide, and will also be on display at London Fashion Week in September,' Edward said.

"By . Ruth Styles . From Frida Kahlo to Grammy award winner Lila Downs, the colourful, beautifully embroidered rebozo has long proved popular with stylish creatives. But it wasn't always so as an exhibition opening early next month at London's Fashion and Textile Museum reveals. Loved by revolutionaries who sported it during the Mexican Revolution, the garment has since become synonymous with Mexican culture as well as a fixture in the nation's wardrobes. Popular: The rebozo remains an integral part of Mexican culture, as seen in the Carmen Rion S/S14 collection . Ironically for a garment beloved of revolutionaries, the rebozo started life as a relative of the Spanish mantilla shawl - introduced to Mexico when colonisers arrived in the New World in the wake of early explorers Christopher Columbus and Sir Walter Raleigh. Even its name derives from Spanish Castilian, with the word rebozo translated as the act of covering or protecting yourself, as defined by 17th century grammarian, Alonso Molina. Nevertheless, the garment, known to Nahuatl-speakers [Aztec] as 'ciua nequealtlapacholoni', was soon adopted by the locals and given a colourful makeover that included native textiles and embroidery techniques. By the 1800s, its popularity was such that all women, regardless of their ethnicity or social class, wore them, whether at work, home or church. Stunning: A modern Carla Fernandez design, as worn by Liliana Dominguez and styled by Betsy Delavega Tay . Iconic: An indigenous Mexican woman shows how to wear the rebozo (left) and right, artist Frida Kahlo . Later, during the Second Mexican Empire, the garment was worn by Empress Carlota, wife of Mexico's first and only Hapsburg emperor, Maxmillian I. But Carlota wasn't the only one to wear it. Along with famous proponents such as Frida Kahlo, who popularised the garment abroad, the rebozo also proved a hit with a very different sort of wearer - the revolutionary. The Mexican Revolution of 1910 brought the rebozo global notoriety as the garment of choice for the 'Adelitas' - rebel women who used it to smuggle guns and other weapons past government checkpoints. By the time the strife ended in 1920, with a victory for the Partido Nacional Revolucionario [National Revolutionary Party], the rebozo had become synonymous with Mexico's struggle for independence. Today, the garment remains a key part of Mexican national dress, the China Poblana, and represents the . journey from birth to death, thanks to its use as both a baby carrier and a shroud. The . new exhibition celebrates all of its many uses as well as drawing . heavily on the collection of Belgian diplomat Robert Everts, who between . 1902 and 1906 lived and worked in Mexico City. Stunning: Bill Blair's 2013 Lady of Miracles (left) and Alfredo Vilchis' 2012 Ex Voto both feature rebozos . One of the first to recognise the rebozo's cultural significance, Everts collected thousands of pieces, some of which will go on display in London for the first time. Another to contribute work to the exhibition is British designer Zandra Rhodes who has created a unique rebozo of her own. Other highlights include work by Graciela Iturbide, Antonio Turok and Lourdes Almeida, while an installation by artist Mauricio Cervantes takes a closer look at the ‘aroma de luto’ rebozo and its use as a death shroud. Commenting on the exhibition, Celia Joicey, head of the Fashion and Textile Museum, said: ‘This important exhibition powerfully demonstrates the vibrancy of textiles in historic and contemporary Mexico. 'We are delighted to be showing the work of leading Mexican artists, designers and museums, in the only UK building designed by Mexican architect Ricardo Legorreta.' Made in Mexico: The Rebozo in Art, Culture and Fashion opens on the 6th June and runs until the 30th August.

"By . Duncan Bech . Dylan Hartley's involvement in the Aviva Premiership final and England's tour to New Zealand continues to hang in the balance. The Northampton captain has been sidelined for nearly two months with a shoulder injury and despite returning to training this week, is still restricted by a reduction in strength in the joint. Saints will decide on Friday morning whether he is ready to face Saracens at Twickenham the following afternoon with director of rugby Jim Mallinder insisting he is under consideration to start. Will he, won't he? Dylan Hartley is doubtful for the Aviva Premiership final and England's tour of New Zealand . Even if he fails to make Northampton's matchday squad, there is still a chance he could fly to New Zealand with a view to participating in the second and third Tests. 'It's touch and go whether he plays and whether we chance him,' Mallinder said. 'If he's fit enough to be in the 23 and take part, the question is do you start him? 'With his improvement there's a very good chance he'll be fit for New Zealand. '(England coach) Stuart Lancaster has taken four hookers already, but if Dylan is fit to tour then I don't think he'll have any hesitation taking him. And he'll probably play. 'Stuart has said to me that if he plays for us, he's definitely on the plane. 'Stuart's not said that if he doesn't play for you, he's not on the plane.' Mallinder admits Hartley, who was sent off in last year's Premiership final for verbally abusing referee Wayne Barnes, is ""desperate"" to face beaten Heineken Cup finalists Saracens on Saturday. 'We know he's an outstanding player and one of the best hookers around. We know what he does for the squad as well,' Mallinder said. 'But we have to balance knowing he could the job for us at the weekend, knowing he'll be better than the other two we have got and also thinking about his health and whether he's at risk by playing. 'Dylan is desperate to play and if you asked him he'd say he's fit.' Chance to make amends? Dylan Hartley was sent off in last season's Aviva Premiership final . Hartley's fitness is of equally pressing concern to England, who are facing a crisis at hooker ahead of their series against the All Blacks which opens on Saturday week. Tom Youngs is unable to tour for family reasons, denying Lancaster his second choice in the position, while next-in-line Rob Webber is struggling with a knee problem. Dan Cole's absence at tighthead prop due to a bulging disc in his neck requiring surgery and fresh fitness concerns over looseheads Mako Vunipola, who has knee damage, and hip-injury victim Joe Marler have decimated the front row options. England's . most valued asset in the number one jersey is Alex Corbisiero, but the . British and Irish Lion only started his first game since October in . Friday's Amlin Challenge Cup final victory over Bath.It was decided to give Corbisiero the summer off, a decision strongly supported by Mallinder. Dropping like flies: Hartley celebrates against Argentina, but England are suffering a crisis in the hooker position . 'On the face of it and from a physical, rugby point of view, Alex is fit to play and to tour,"" Mallinder said. 'But what we're doing is right and when I say 'we' I mean Stuart, myself, England's medics and our medics. 'We're looking at the long-term for Alex Corbisiero and the best thing for him long-term is to have a holiday after this weekend. 'He'll come back to a reconditioning programme for him to make sure he's in the best shape possible for next year leading into the World Cup. 'Alex has had bad experiences with both knees. At the moment he has no pain and is running freely and is confident. 'Nobody would ever like to say it will never reoccur, but what we do know is that Alex needs to be managed for the rest of his career.' Take a break: Alex Corbisiero has been given the summer off to recuperate from injury . Northampton are one victory away from a first Premiership title and Mallinder outlined the impact being crowned English champions would have at Franklin's Gardens. 'We are a big club in a massive rugby area where rugby means so much. The whole town get behind us,' he said. 'We've won a Heineken Cup which is a big achievement and if we won a Premiership it would be huge and the effects would be massive.'","Dylan Hartley is rated doubtful for Northampton's Aviva Premiership final .

"By . Bianca London . As the live shows kicked off with a bang this week on Britain's Got Talent, the attention may have been on semi-finalists Collabro and Darcy Oake but it was hard to miss the ever-radiant Amanda Holden and Alesha Dixon. With their perfect skin and glossy hair, the judges looked flawless on Monday and Tuesday night's shows and now FEMAIL can reveal exactly how the they achieve their on-stage glow. Amanda may have wowed for two consecutive nights but you can be sure she didn't wake up looking that great. Her glam squad have revealed it took three hours to get the 43-year-old HD-ready. Striking: Amanda Holden has wowed as a judge on Britain's Got Talent this week so FEMAIL sought to discover her secret . Speaking to MailOnline, Amanda's hair and make-up artist, Christian Vermaak, said: 'For the live shows we start three hours before we go on air. I have two hours with Amanda to complete her hair and make-up and then she gets dressed before she goes live to the nation.' Christian, who has also worked with the Minogue sisters, joined Amanda's revamped glam squad this year and the pair have a great time getting ready for the show. 'It is great fun,' said Christian. 'Amanda has her Spotify playlist on the go and we soak up the atmosphere. Our dressing rooms are right next door to the studio so we can hear the audience coming in - so you can literally feel the excitement build. 'Amanda likes to be really organised and . she is very feminine so she her dressing room smells amazing with flowers and her favourite candles. It is a joy . to work in.' Glow getter: Christian Vermaak explained that Amanda likes to look fresh and minimal so, on Monday night, he opted for a golden and dewy look to complement her gown . To achieve Amanda's bouncy 'do, Christian washes her hair with Philip B Oud Royal Forever Shine Shampoo. It helped to create what he desribes as a '70s brushed-out look', a very soft and feminine style to complement her beautiful white gown on Monday night's show. To wet hair, he applied an anti-gravity product that gives body, before blow-drying and using curling tongs. It was left to cool and set before he combed it out with a paddle brush. 'I wanted to get that voluminous, soft look to offset the streamlined dress,' he said. Glam squad: Christian Vermaak, pictured with Emma Bunton, works with Amanda . Speaking about Amanda's preferred look, he said: 'Overall Amanda likes to look fresh and minimal. Last night we went for a golden and dewy look, again something simple to complement the outfit, but the golden tones made sure she looked glamorous for this stage of the live shows.' Get Amanda's radiant glow with Christian's hero product - Shiseido foundation - and Urban Decay original naked palette, plus a strip of very light and feathery eyelashes from MAC to brighten her eyes. For Tuesday's show, Amanda wanted a really 'smooth, glossy style', so he set her hair in Cloud Nine heated rollers to add body, movement and volume. 'I wanted a hair style that was super soft to complement the flow of her dress,' he added. For Amanda's face, he used Shisedo foundation and the HD palette to sculpt her brows. 'I wanted that Elizabeth Taylor high-glamour look so I used the Stila palette for her eyelids and Stila Major lash for her eyelases. On the cheeks I applied Mac Contour Powder, with their Strobe cream on the cheekbones. 'Amanda's lips were first lined with Urban Decay Naked 2‎ and over the top of that Naked Lovechild, that pink colour really popped against the green of her dress. 'Because Amanda's dress was low-cut last night, we used Mac Face and Body foundation on her arms and body and then Kryolan's Body Shimmer in silver so she literally dazzled on stage,' he explained. He may have an arsenal of products on hand, but Christian maintains that Amanda doesn't need much help and he instead creates, what he likes to call, an 'enhancement of her natural look'. 'In all honesty Amanda leads such a healthy lifestyle that it shows in her skin, she has the most incredible complexion and her skin is naturally glowing - if you could bottle her ""secret"" then the Amanda Holden skincare range would be a best seller,' he said. Glow-getters: Both judge's make-up artists say the ladies are lucky enough to already have great skin that only needs a little touch-up . As for Alesha Dixon, she calls on her close friend and talented make-up artist Francesca Neill, who also works with Rochelle Humes, Girls Aloud and Little Mix. Depending on what look they're going for, it can take Alesah between 30 minutes to an hour and a half to get BGT-ready.  'There is always music playing in her dressing room', said Francesca. 'It's so much fun getting her ready. It gives us all time to catch up and have a gossip. It's actually really organised. Everything's really neat and tidy. 'We try to keep it like that but then . in the last ten minutes when there's a mad rush there ends up being . make-up and hair products everywhere.' One of the main reasons that Francesca loves working with Alesha is because she's so daring with her beauty look. Last minute touch-up: Francesca Neill, who has also worked with Girls Aloud on their Ten tour, gives Alesha's lips a quick slick of gloss . She'll try anything! Francesca says the best part of working with close pal Alesha is her versatility and willingness to try out new looks . 'Alesha's great because she's willing to try anything which allows me to be really creative. She's so versatile, she's a make-up artist's dream. One day it will be a natural, fresh-faced look, the next could be graphic and fierce, then soft, feminine and pretty look. There's no one set look that we go for.' Like Amanda, Francesca says that Alesha is very lucky because she has incredible skin, which doesn't require much work. 'She's really healthy and looks after her skin and that really shows in the make-up. I enhance this by using great skincare products like Sisley face masks and moisturisers. I also use a luminous foundation on her, usually Armarni, which allows her skin to shine through and look super radiant,' she said. Here they come!

On one of the hottest days of the year so far, the creme de la creme of the small screen descended on the Theatre . Royal, Drury Lane, in London's West End and brought the glamour of Hollywood with them. Thespians such as Helena Bonham Carter, Olivia Colman and Keeley Hawes looked picture perfect as . they faced a gauntlet of flashbulbs. But, however genetically blessed . they may be, you can be sure they didn't wake up looking that flawless. Scroll down for video . Big night: Last night saw the best British TV talent hit the red carpet to celebrate the small screen's biggest night: the Arqiva TV BAFTA Awards 2014 . From . expert make-up artists to nail technicians - and, of course, fake tanners - . the A-listers called in their loyal team of experts who worked like a . well-oiled machine to ensure that they were ready for their close ups. FEMAIL went backstage at last night's event to get the low-down on the star's fashion and beauty preparations. Before the stars hit the red carpet, they checked into a swanky suite at the Corinthia Hotel where MAC cosmetics, Mark Hill hair, St. Tropez tanners, CARAT jewelers and House Of Fraser fashion experts were on hand to spruce the actors and actresses up. The MAC Senior Artists set up camp for the . 11th year running, with an arsenal of products - including Kelly and Sharon Osbourne's latest range, as well as the new Maleficent collection - to help the likes of Caroline Flack, Susanna Reid and Olivia Colman prepare for the glare of the photographers' flashbulbs. Lady in red: Susanna Reid sat in the hot seat and requested a 'smokey eye and red lip' to match her red BIBA dress from House Of Fraser . MAC Senior Artist, Rebecca . Butterworth, said of last night's beauty trends: ‘On the red carpet, gorgeous skin with luminescent, . luxurious highlights dominated, accented with softly lined eyes, . reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn and lips in shades of coral, vermillion . and scarlet.’ MAC Senior Artist Dominic Skinner told MailOnline: 'Everybody wants the Kim Kardashian contoured look, it is definitely the most requested. When Kim does hers, it is purely for selfies but I like to tone it down to make it very red carpet ready.' He also explained that coral is the new red in terms of lipstick for this season. That didn't stop Good Morning Britain presenter Susanna Reid, who was overheard saying: 'I'm wearing a red dress so I wanted to go for a smokey eye and a red lip, would that work?' Her make-up artist, Dean Rudd, duly applied concrete eyeshadow, and a combination of Lasting Lust and Viva Glam on her lips. It only took him about fifteen minutes to work his magic on Susanna, who was enjoying the 80s music blaring. Gothic chic: Caroline Flack went for a smokey eye and had her favourite MAC Face and Body swept over her face . To watch video tutorial in full click here . As for her tan, Susanna went for a glamorous look to complement her red dress. 'Susanna’s look is all about . the ""backsie"" tan thanks to her gorgeous Spanish-inspired backless . dress,' said Jules Heptonstall, St.Tropez Tanning and Skin Finishing Expert, who was on hand to give the stars their golden glow. 'Susanna had . two generous coats of St.Tropez’s new Self Tan Express mist two days . prior to the TV BAFTAs, paying particular attention to her back, which . she left on for three hours before washing off.' X Factor presenter Caroline Flack also checked into the MAC beauty suite and spent a good half an hour in the hot seat - popping back just before she stepped onto the red carpet for a final touch up (and frantically scoured the suite for some nude nail varnish). The TV presenter debated between a glossy or matte lip, all while singing along to the 80s tunes pumping out. She had her favourite MAC Face and Body swept over her face (Caroline loves to use this on those often-displayed legs, too) and went for a smokey eye. Hairwise, she opted for . Mark Hill's Gothic Glamour style to go with her black 50s style prom dress. 'I . created this look using my Extreme Wicked Waver by tonging each . section and pinning the curls to cool. My top tip for soft waves like . these is to brush them out gently afterwards,' said the hairdresser. Fresh faced glow: Olivia Coleman, the leading lady of the evening, went for a fresh look achieved with MAC's skin brightening serum and completed with a peal highlighter and Lady Danger lipstick . Glowgetter: Laura Whitmore, who is naturally very pale, was given a fake tan by St. Tropez. She opted for the Grecian Goddess look because she was keen not to look too washed out in her white dress . Laura Whitmore went for the Grecian Goddess tanned look. 'Laura is naturally very pale so she loves self tan and was keen not to look washed out in her gorgeous cream number,' explained Jules. 'To create her look I sprayed her with St.Tropez’s new Express mist which she left on for two hours to develop to a medium golden glow.' Speaking about her hairstyle, Mark Hill said: 'Laura Whitmore stunned on the red carpet . this year with gorgeous Hollywood waves. 'I swept these to the side to . complement her chic halter neck dress and emphasise her gorgeous high . cheekbones. Add shine to a style like this with a spritz of Bedazzled . Anti Humidity Shine Spray.' As for Millie Mackintosh, who has a penchant for a golden glow, Jules gave her the Glamazonian. Remember me? Olivia Newman Young, who starred on last season's Made In Chelsea, helped Millie Mackintosh, right, get ready for the big event . 'Millie’s futuristic, metallic dress needed really polished looking skin to complete the high shine look. I used St.Tropez Instant Tan to shade and contour her arms, applying with a foundation brush for an airbrushed finish. I then buffed her skin with a dual fibre brush and highlighted her shoulders using St.Tropez Gold Skin Illuminator for a high fashion finish.' 1. Millie’s hair was prepped with Work it Girl Shine Protect and Control spray (£5.99) 2. Using the Session Styling Cushion Brush (£8.99),  Mark swept Millie's hair back towards her crown and secured into a high ponytail using a covered band. 3.  To create a sleek twist, he then wrapped a small section of hair around the base of the ponytail to cover the hair band, and used Leopard Ceramic Styler straighteners (£99.99) to glide over the ponytail itself to ensure a smooth finish. 4. The red carpet look was finished with a spritz of Bedazzled Anti - Humidity Shine spray (£5.49) which smoothed away any frizz and flyaways and added a gorgeous shine . Although Millie is a trained make-up artist herself, she called on her friend Olivia Newman Young, who also starred in the last season of Made In Chelsea, to give her a makeover. Speaking about her beauty look, Millie said: 'I wanted to do something very different from last year. I am making the most of having this gorgeous tan, I love having a sunkissed glow, it's my go-to look. 'I wanted to take that onto my eye as well so I went for a really bronzed smokey eye, sunkissed glow skin and a vampy lip to match.' To achieve Millie's flawless skin, Olivia buffed Armani Designer Lift Foundation onto her skin and used Soleil Tan de Chanel bronzer, which she applied with an angled MAC brush, where the sun would hit her face. She then used a shadow to contour and enhance Millie's cheekbones and define her face - even popping some foundation onto her ears because Millie decided to wear her hair up. She defined her brows with a HD brow palette and used MAC's coffee eye pencil around Millie's lashes, which she smudged to create a smokey effect. Tanorexic? Speaking about Claudia Winkleman's look, celebrity tanner Jules said: 'Claudia is a self-confessed tanning addict so I wanted to try something new with her for the BAFTAs. Instead of her usual DIY job, I gave her an all over healthy glow' Millie completed the look with her Belgravia lashes - from her own range - and a dramatic plum lip using Vino lip pencil and Hang Up lipstick from MAC. 'I love this look. It's vampy and very high fashion,' said a pleased Millie. Stylist and TV presenter Courtney Smith said of Millie's look: 'Millie went Gothic with the dark lips but shines bright in a fully sequined metallic column dress, which was flawless against her dewy iridescent skin and long lean frame.' Flawless: To achieve Millie's dewy skin, Olivia buffed Armani Designer Lift Foundation onto her skin and used Soleil Tan de Chanel bronzer, which she applied with an angled MAC brush, where the sun would hit . Hair wizard: Celebrity hairdresser Mark Hill and official hair partner to the Arqiva BAFTA TV Awards, takes us through how he created Millie Mackintosh's sleek red carpet hairstyle . Get the look: To create a sleek twist, he then wrapped a small section of hair around the base of the ponytail to cover the hair band, and used Leopard Ceramic Styler straighteners to glide over the ponytail itself to ensure a smooth finish . Mark Hill worked his magic on Millie's sleek hairstyle, using plenty of products to help it stay in place. He also worked on Coronation street star Samia Ghadie, who opted for an elegant up-do, which Mark accessorised with diamante pins to add a little extra glamour. 'An un-done chignon is an easy style to re-create yourself. My top tip is to add bite and texture through the hair first using a sea salt spray. This will make it easier to style,' he advised. Speaking about Inbetweeners star Emily Atack, who wore Mary Portas, Mark said: 'Emily has gorgeous thick hair, and wanted a relaxed sexy style to play up her tuxedo outfit. 'I created a bit of dishevelled texture using a Rock Chick Wave wand, but didn’t pin the curls to cool, so they’d drop to create more of a natural kink. 'Add volume at the roots for some extra vava voom using some dry shampoo.' Hair it hear first!

"By . Sam Webb . Michael Bowen, 58, died of a seizure two hours after being finally admitted into the hospital¿s strained accident and emergency department. His heartbroken mother Joan said: 'I just want to know why my son was kept in an ambulance for so long' A dying man was left for nearly five hours in an ambulance in a hospital car park because NHS staff were too busy, an inquest heard yesterday. Michael Bowen, 58, died of a seizure two hours after being finally admitted into the hospital’s strained accident and emergency department. An inquest heard how the Welsh NHS hospital would 'frequently' keep patients in ambulances in the car park because of a shortage of beds. His heartbroken mother Joan wept as she said: 'I just want to know why my son was kept in an ambulance for so long. 'He was a good son and a good person - I miss him hugely.' The hearing was told former miner Mr Bowen was 'significantly ill' when his mother called 999 for help. He was taken five miles to Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, South Wales, complaining of breathing difficulties and abdominal pain. When he arrived at the hospital in the early hours of the morning, he was taken inside to be seen by a nurse. But Mr Bowen was then returned to the waiting ambulance because there were no beds.The inquest heard how two other patients were also sat in ambulances at the time. Nurse Caroline Gardener said: 'Of the three patients in ambulances I thought Mr Bowen was top priority. He needed clinically to be seen first. 'But I thought the safest place for him was to go back into the ambulance where he could be monitored. 'It is not uncommon for the department not to have any beds available a few times a week. 'I am professionally concerned about the situation, because it was a danger to anyone walking through the door - it puts everyone at A&E at risk.' The inquest heard that in the early hours of January 16 the hospital was experiencing 'capacity issues'. The emergency department had become 'bottle-necked' by the number of admissions during the night. The Welsh NHS hospital would 'frequently' keep patients in ambulances in the car park because of a shortage of beds. There were 23 patients in the A&E department - with 11 waiting for beds. Patients were left in corridors on trolleys. Nurse sister Deborah Lewis who treated Mr Bowen told the hearing she arrived on her shift to see three ambulances outside A&E with patients inside. Coroner Andrew Barkley asked her: 'Have you seen this before?' She replied: 'Yes, too often. It happens quite frequently now.' Mr Bowen, of Bettws, Bridgend, South Wales, had been in the hospital for two hours collapsed with a sudden seizure. The inquest heard he was suffering from severe liver disease. Nurses moved him into a resuscitation unit. But Mr Bowen, who weighed 25 stone, died of a thrombosis. Police investigated the death of bachelor Mr Bowen, who lived with his parents, but found no criminal negligence. An independent investigation by consultant Andrew Balham of neighbouring Wye Valley NHS Trust found a number of failures in his treatment. His report said: 'After the initial diagnose the critical care team should have been notified. 'All these things would have been dealt with if the patient was in the emergency department itself.' However, in his narrative verdict, Mr Barkley, found that ‘on the balance of probabilities’, Mr Bowen’s death was not caused by or contributed to by the delay in transferring him into A&E from the ambulance.","Michael Bowen, 58, died two hours after he was finally admitted to A&E .

"By . Sophie Borland . More than one in three patients in some NHS hospitals suffer from diabetes, figures show. The condition is putting an increasing strain on the health service, costing an estimated £10billion a year, yet many staff do not know how to treat it. The most common form of diabetes, type 2, is strongly linked to lifestyle factors such as obesity, lack of exercise and poor diet. Bishop Auckland Hospital, County Durham, has . 35 per cent of patients who are diabetic - the highest rate in the . country. The condition is expected to cost the NHS £17bn in 20 years . Earlier this month the Mail revealed that one hospital bed in seven was occupied by a patient with diabetes. Now a snapshot NHS survey shows the highest rate was at Bishop Auckland Hospital, County Durham, where 35 per cent of patients are diabetic. At Hammersmith Hospital in West London it was 28 per cent, followed by 25 per cent at West Cumberland Hospital in Whitehaven, Cumbria. Experts say there is a link between diabetes rates and obesity levels in an area. Of those in hospital with diabetes, 93 per cent have type 2. However, many with the condition are not obese and it is common in the elderly. Other hospitals badly affected are Leicester, Birmingham and Newham, East London, which all recorded rates of 24 per cent. Diabetes accounts for around 10 per cent of the NHS budget, with most spent on complications such as amputations and stroke. Hammersmith Hospital, West London - where 28 per cent of patients have . diabetes - had the second highest rate, according to the survey. Experts . say there is a link between diabetes rates and obesity levels . As the number of those suffering from the condition increases, costs to the NHS are expected to soar to £17billion in the next 20 years. Last week the former head of the NHS admitted he had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes after living on fry-ups for breakfast, triple-decker sandwiches and eight pints of beer every Friday night. Sir David Nicholson, who retired last month on a £2million pension, said he had lost control of his health, and the condition was ‘absolutely, completely my fault’. Around 3.6million Britons have diabetes but this is expected to rise to 5million in ten years (stock image) Around 3.6million Britons have diabetes – of whom 90 per cent have type 2 – but this is expected to rise to 5million in ten years. There are between 200,000 and 250,000 new cases of diabetes every year, but this is offset by the deaths of up to 140,000 patients, meaning that the population with the condition grows by an annual 100,000 to 150,000. Around 3.6million Britons have diabetes - of whom 90 per cent have type 2 - but this is expected to rise to 5million in ten years . Campaigners warn that hospital patients with diabetes are particularly vulnerable as some NHS staff do not know how to look after them properly. Simon O’Neill, of Diabetes UK, said: ‘This is becoming a big problem in virtually every hospital and it seems to be getting worse. ‘The biggest growth is in type 2 and we know that’s linked to a growing elderly population and a growing overweight and obese population.’ He added: ‘People with diabetes tend to end up staying two to three days longer than average because they take slightly longer to heal and recover. The level of knowledge about diabetes among general hospital staff isn’t that great. ‘Often, the hospital mucks up their diabetes control and they’re not well enough to leave until the diabetes has been stabilised. There is a large number of medication errors in hospital, giving them insulin without food, causing them to have low blood sugar. ‘We’re also aware of people being allowed to develop foot ulcers in hospital just by not turning them and making sure they’re not spending all day in bed.’ The latest figures for hospital patients are compiled by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, which carries out a diabetes audit every year. They are a snapshot of the number of patients with diabetes on a given night, so vary slightly from year to year, although overall trends remain the same. Last year the highest rates were recorded at Birmingham City Hospital, where 31 per cent of patients were diabetic.

"By . Lizzie Parry . The brother of a young woman who died from bowel cancer - despite being told she was 'too young' to get the disease - has spoken out to try and spare other people the same fate. For six months Suzanne Gould went to see doctors, complaining of crippling stomach pains. The agony was so severe that the 29-year-old was forced to miss part of her brother Rob's wedding. But doctors told the biomedical technician she was too young to be suffering bowel cancer, instead diagnosing her with Crohn's disease and inflammatory bowel disease. Suzanne Gould died in March after an 18-month battle with bowel cancer. After complaining of severe stomach pains doctors told her she was too young to be suffering the disease, diagnosing her with Crohn's disease and inflammatory bowel syndrome. Dr Gould is pictured on her wedding day with her husband Simon . Today Dr Gould's brother Rob Newton, pictured with his sister as children, said he is determined to raise money and awareness in his sister's memory. She died on March 18, aged 29, just weeks after doctors revealed her condition had become terminal . In November 2012, Dr Gould's condition deteriorated and she was rushed into A&E. She was taken into surgery, where doctors discovered a huge tumour invading her bowel. For the next 18 months Dr Gould battled the disease, frequently being admitted into hospital for rounds of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. But in February she and her family received the news they had been dreading - the cancer was terminal. In her final weeks her friends and family celebrated her 29th birthday, and prepared to say their goodbyes. Weeks later on March 18, the Kingston University technician, from Dorking in Surrey, passed away. Today her brother Mr Newton, 30, said he is determined to raise money and awareness in his sister's memory. Mr Newton said his sister was adamant she wanted to help others, allowing her case to be presented to the government to help research and education . He said: 'When she was diagnosed with a tumour, it was devastating but equally frustrating that we hadn’t known sooner. 'But through it all Suzanne handled her treatment with dignity and bravery. 'She was not only positive and determined to beat cancer but wanted to raise awareness in young people that you can never be too young to have bowel cancer. 'It was a huge shock when we discovered it was terminal. 'But throughout it all Suzanne was bright and upbeat. 'She was that kind of person, wanting to help others and stay strong for her family.' Dr Gould spent months in the Royal Marsden Hospital in Sutton where she endured bouts of chemotherapy and radiotherapy to try and treat the cancer. She was also treated in Medway Hospital and finally cared for in St Catherine’s Hospice in Crawley. But she lost her fight on March 18, leaving behind her lecturer husband, Dr Simon Gould, and her family. Mr Newton is now planning to complete a fun run for . the World Cancer Research Fund to help the network of charities in their . quest to prevent cancer. Mr Newton (right) is taking part in a fun run to raise money for the World Cancer Research Fund, who work to prevent the disease . Bowel cancer, also known as colorectal cancer, is the third most common cancer in the UK. In 2011, 42,747 cases of the disease were diagnosed across the country. Symptoms include blood in the stools, a change in bowel habits, abdominal pain and unexplained weight loss. Bowel cancer is one of the most preventable forms of the disease. Scientists estimating about half of all cases in the UK could be prevented by maintaining a healthy weight, choosing a healthy diet, not drinking alcohol, and being physically active. There are a number of lifestyle factors that will increase a person's chance of developing bowel cancer. They are: . - Being overweight or obese- Lack of physical activity- Diets low in fibre- Diets high in red and processed meat- Drinking alcohol- SmokingOther risk factors include:- Age, risk increases as you get older- Family history of bowel cancer- Personal history of polyps or inflammatory bowel diseaseThe majority of bowel cancer cases can be successfully treated if they are detected early enough. That is why it is important to take part in NHS bowel screening when invited. Source: World Cancer Research Fund . On June 5 he will run 3km in a bid to raise funds and awareness of the link . between cancer and diet, physical activity and body weight. 'Suzanne didn’t just focus on herself when she was ill,' he said. 'She . was a case study for Bowel Cancer UK presentation at the Houses of . Parliament because she wanted to help with research and education. 'We . now need to continue her legacy and this run is all about raising . awareness about the condition and helping to collect much needed money . for cancer prevention research, which can lead to early diagnosis and . more effective treatment. 'Bowel cancer is the second biggest cancer killer in the UK, but if diagnosed at an early stage, it's very treatable. 'She left us on March 18, gone but never forgotten.' Michael Smeaton, World Cancer Research Fund’s deputy head of fundraising, said: 'We’re honoured that Rob is raising money for us. 'Cancer can be devastating and it is thanks to people like Rob and his company Informa that we can continue to fund vital research into preventing this disease.' Scientists say about a third of cancers could be prevented if people were to maintain a healthy body weight, eat a healthy diet and be more physically active. Bowel cancer is the third most common cancer in the UK. In 2011, around 42,000 cases of bowel cancer were diagnosed.

"By . Lucy Laing . They may not look it, but these twins are a real pair of fighters - having survived months of chemotherapy while in the womb. Their mother Sarah Pierce was 16 weeks pregnant when doctors broke the terrible news that she had breast cancer. The only chance of saving her life was aggressive chemotherapy, but she was terrified that the unborn twins would not survive. Against the odds, however, they did - and were born healthy. Experts say they have never known of a mother having chemotherapy while pregnant with twins before. So lucky: Cancer survivor Sarah Pierce says Jack and Lily, now 18 months old, are full of life . Not only that, but she also had radiotherapy and a mastectomy. Miss Pierce, 40, a cashier, had been desperate for a family with her partner Adam Sparkey, 27, an assistant retail manager, and the couple had saved up £4,200 for IVF treatment. She said: 'I'd had an ectopic pregnancy ten years previously and doctors had to remove my fallopian tubes, so IVF was my only chance of becoming pregnant.' Two weeks after the treatment, she discovered she was pregnant and a fortnight later a scan showed there were two heartbeats. She said: 'We were absolutely thrilled.' But at 16 weeks pregnant she discovered a lump in her breast while in the shower, and a week later doctors delivered the devastating news that it was breast cancer. Pregnant: Sarah Pierce underwent chemo, radiotherapy and a mastectomy before the birth . Miss Pierce said: 'It was devastating. I couldn't stop crying. 'I was so worried about the babies. The doctors told me I had to have a mastectomy followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy – all while I was still pregnant. 'All I could think of was how could they possibly survive through all that.' Miss Pierce had a mastectomy the following week, when she was 18 weeks pregnant. Two weeks later she started chemotherapy, losing all her hair - causing her to wear a wig - and suffering from exhaustion. 'Luckily tests on my lymph nodes showed the cancer hadn't spread, which was such a relief,' she said. 'I was so worried about the chemotherapy damaging the babies, but scans every week showed they had kept on growing. Each week it was such a relief to still see them there.' Miss Pierce then had a month's course of radiotherapy, which finished when she was 30 weeks pregnant. Five weeks later, in November 2012, the babies were born by emergency caesarean at Newcross Hospital in Wolverhampton, Lily weighing 5lb 1oz and her twin Jack weighing 4lb 13oz. Miss Pierce said: 'It was the most amazing moment when I finally held them in my arms after everything that had happened. 'They were two little fighters - to have gone through all that in the womb.' Straight after the twins' birth their mother had to have another course of chemotherapy, which finished three months later. 'It was a much stronger treatment and I felt so exhausted, but every time I held Lily and Jack in my arms, I knew that I was doing it for them,' she said. 'I was determined to see my babies grow up and if it meant going through this, then I would do it.' She has just finished a 12-month course of the breast cancer drug Herceptin and doctors have told her the cancer is in remission. She will have to take another drug, Tamoxifen, for the next five years to stop it returning. She said: 'I feel so lucky that I'm still here and my babies are both here safe and sound. 'They are 18 months old now and are full of life. I feel like the luckiest mum in the world.' A spokesman for leading breast cancer charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer said: 'We are not aware of such a case before, where a woman has been pregnant with twins while having treatment.'","Sarah Pierce was 16 weeks pregnant when told she had breast cancer .

"By . Richard Spillett . A European court has upheld a decision not to extradite a bungling German doctor to the UK over the death of a pensioner from a drugs overdose. A coroner's inquest in the UK ruled that David Gray, 70, was unlawfully killed in 2008 after 'incompetent' Dr Daniel Ubani, who was working as an out of hours locum, fatally administered 10 times the normal dose of diamorphine. The family of Mr Gray, of Manea, Cambridgeshire, have been campaigning for Dr Ubani to face charges in the UK over the death but this has been rejected by German authorities. The . European Court of Human Rights today backed a German investigation into his actions and a decision he should not be sent back to Britain. David Gray, pictured (left) in the 1970s, died in 2008 after Dr Daniel Ubani (right) administered 10 times the normal dose of diamorphine . Mr Gray's sons Rory (left) and Stuart Gray hit out today after a European Court ruled the doctor can't be extradited to Britain . Speaking . on Sky News, Mr Gray's son Stuart, of Kidderminster, Worcestershire, . said he was 'bitterly, bitterly disappointed' by the decision. He . added: 'I think it's got wider ramifications in the UK because it means . people can come over from the European Union and not answer to UK law. 'We need . to digest this and go back to our lawyers and see if we can lodge an . appeal or not. He's still licensed to practice out there, we don't know . what he's doing.' Mr . Gray's other son Rory, who lives in Germany, said: 'German authorities . convicted him of a minor misdemeanour, there was no hearing, no trial . and Ubani never answered for what he's done. 'This is a green light for charlatans to go to other countries and do whatever they like.' Mr Gray had been suffering renal colic when he was treated by Dr Ubani at his home on February 16, 2008 . His sons says Dr Ubani, who has been allowed to continue practicing in Germany, has never faced proper justice for his actions . The Strasbourg court ruled: 'The . patient's sons complained that the authorities in Germany, where the . doctor was tried and convicted of having caused the death by negligence, . had not provided for an effective investigation into their father's . death. 'The . court accepted that the German trial court had sufficient evidence . available to it for the doctor's conviction by penal order without . having held a hearing. Dr Ubani admitted he had confused morphine with another drug and a coroner branded him 'incompetent' and described Mr Gray's death as 'gross negligence and manslaughter' 'Moreover, . the [family] had been sufficiently informed of the proceedings in . Germany, and the German authorities had been justified in not . extraditing the doctor to the United Kingdom in view of the proceedings . before the German courts.' Dr Ubani, a 67-year-old Nigerian-born German citizen, was on his first UK shift as a locum when he killed Mr Gray by injecting 100mg of diamorphine. He was struck off in the UK and given a suspended sentence in Germany for death by negligence but is still able to practice there. A European arrest warrant was issued by Cambridgeshire Police but could not be carried out because legal proceedings had begun in Germany. Mr Gray had been suffering renal colic when he was treated by Dr Ubani at his home on February 16, 2008. His death highlighted national concerns about the standard of locum doctors from abroad working in the UK. Coroner William Morris described Mr Gray's death as 'gross negligence and manslaughter' and said Dr Ubani was 'incompetent'. Dr Ubani admitted he had confused the morphine with another drug. He had flown into the UK the day before his 12-hour Cambridgeshire shift for GP service provider Take Care Now, and had only had a few hours' sleep, a GMC panel was told. A doctor who gave him an induction expressed concerns that Dr Ubani had no NHS experience, did not know the area, and that he did not have enough time to properly train him. The doctor had previously not been selected by Leeds Primary Care Trust because he had failed a language test. But the GMC panel heard evidence that Dr Ubani was competent in spoken English and his employers had no problems understanding him.","David Gray died after getting huge dose of morphine from Dr Daniel Ubani .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Scientists have proved that the sky is certainly not the limit for the internet, by showing it could be possible to get broadband on the moon. A team of researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s (MIT) Lincoln Laboratory demonstrated for the first time that a the technology exists to provide space dwellers with the connectivity we all enjoy here on Earth. It could allow large data transfers and even high-definition video streaming. Scientists at MIT say they have devised a way to transfer large amounts of data quickly and easily across the vast expanse of space. This could provide future astronauts with a 'broadband network' on the moon. This is a computer-aided design drawing of the optical module on the satellite showing the telescope and gimbal (pivoted support) The team has been conducting tests transferring data from the earth to the moon, with specialist laser-based communication equipment. A ground terminal at White Sands, New Mexico, uses four separate telescopes to send the uplink signal to the moon. Each . telescope is about six inches (15 centimetres) in diameter and fed by a . laser transmitter that sends information coded as pulses of invisible . infrared light. The . reason for the four telescopes is that each one transmits light through . a different column of air that experiences different bending effects . from the atmosphere, Stevens said. This . increases the chance that at least one of the laser beams will interact . with the receiver, which is mounted on a satellite orbiting the moon. This . receiver uses a slightly narrower telescope to collect the light, which . is then focused into an optical fibre similar to those used in . terrestrial fibreoptic networks. From . there, the signal is amplified about 30,000 times. A photodetector . converts the pulses of light into electrical pulses that are in turn . converted into data bit patterns that carry the transmitted message. At the Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics (Cleo) 2014, held between 8 and 13 June in San Jose, California the team will present new details and the first comprehensive overview of the 'on-orbit performance' of their record-shattering laser-based communication uplink between the moon and Earth, which beat the previous record transmission speed by a factor of 4,800. Earlier reports have stated what the team accomplished, but have not provided the details of the implementation. Mark Stevens of MIT Lincoln Laboratory said: 'This will be the first time that we present both the implementation overview and how well it actually worked. 'The on-orbit performance was excellent and close to what we’d predicted, giving us confidence that we have a good understanding of the underlying physics.' The team made history last year when their Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration (LLCD) transmitted data over the 239,000 miles (385,000) kilometers between the moon and Earth at a download rate of 622 megabits per second, faster than any radio frequency (RF) system. They also transmitted data from Earth to the moon at 19.44 megabits per second, a factor of 4,800 times faster than the best RF uplink ever used. Nasa's Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration (LLCD) involved two-way laser communication between the Ladee spacecraft and Earth. It showed that such a method could transmit huge amounts of data. This means, for example, HD video could be transmitted to and from deep space . Mr Stevens added: 'Communicating at high data rates from Earth to the moon with laser beams is challenging because of the 400,000-kilometer distance spreading out the light beam. 'It’s doubly difficult going through the atmosphere, because turbulence can bend light-causing rapid fading or dropouts of the signal at the receiver. 'We demonstrated tolerance to medium-size cloud attenuations, as well as large atmospheric-turbulence-induced signal power variations, or fading, allowing error-free performance even with very small signal margins.' While the LLCD design is directly relevant for near-Earth missions, the team predicts that it’s also extendable to deep-space missions to Mars and the outer planets.","Scientists at MIT say they can transmit vast amounts of data across space .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Scientists appear to have traced the irresistible pull of the refrigerator at 2am to the 'night munchies' gene . Scientists appear to have traced the irresistible pull of the refrigerator at 2am to the 'night munchies"" gene. When the PER1 gene is faulty, the natural mechanism that synchronises sleeping and eating goes awry, they believe. This can lead to 'night eating syndrome', the inability to avoid feeling hungry at night which in some people can disrupt sleep and lead to over-eating and weight gain. The discovery was made by conducting tests on mice with two human genes, PER1 and its partner PER2, which has previously been linked to sleep disturbances. When PER2 was defective in the mice, as expected they dozed off earlier than usual. But de-activating PER1 affected eating behaviour, leading to mice wanting to eat when they should be sleeping. 'For a long time, people discounted night eating syndrome as not real,' said lead scientist Dr Satchidananda Panda, from the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California. 'These results in mice suggest that it could actually be a genetic basis for the syndrome. 'We really never expected that we would be able to decouple the sleep-wake cycle and the eating cycle, especially with a simple mutation. It opens up a whole lot of future questions about how these cycles are regulated.' When the researchers restricted access to food, offering it to the mice only at normal meal times, they found that even animals with the faulty PER1 gene maintained a normal weight. Over a 10-week period their weight was no different to that of animals with functioning PER1 genes. When the PER1 gene is faulty, the natural mechanism that synchronises sleeping and eating goes awry, they believe . This showed that the weight gain caused by faulty PER1 was entirely due to meal mistiming and not other metabolic factors. The scientists believe that normally, PER1 and PER2 are kept synchronised and turned on and off at the same time, keeping sleep and eating cycles aligned. But a mutation in PER1 can break this link, leading to an urge to eat at night. The research is reported in the journal Cell Reports.","Discovery was made by conducting tests on mice with two human genes .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Dryland ecosystems such as deserts play a more important role in the global carbon cycle than previously thought, research has revealed. And one of the biggest contributors, responsible for a huge spike in the amount of CO2 absorbed in 2011, is located in Australia. The findings suggest that the Australian Outback, when exposed to increased rainfall and in turn grows more vegetation, could become a giant 'carbon sink' and might even be a major driver for global carbon absorption. Research suggests that the Australian savannah (pictured) played a major role in the global absorption of carbon in 2011. Other vast carbon sinks in the Southern Hemisphere also had an effect, but Australia was said to be the major driver . However, researchers warn it is not a complete solution to the problems caused by man-made climate change. Montana State University faculty member Ben Poulter and his collaborators explained their findings in the journal Nature. El . Niño refers to a set of conditions when the surface of the sea in an . area along the Equator in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean becomes . hotter than usual. The . average water temperature in that area is typically between 1 and 3°C . (approximately 2 and 5°F) warmer than normal during this event. This . has the effect of adding huge amounts of heat and moisture into the . atmosphere, ultimately affecting patterns of air pressure and rainfall . across the Pacific and globally. Strong El Niño events occur every 20 years or so, but researchers recently said this could drop to 10 years thanks to global warming. At the opposite end of the scale, La Niña is the climatological counterpart to El Niño. La Niña refers to periods when sea-surface temperatures around the Equator are cooler than normal. This has a similar affect on air pressure and rainfall because it suppresses how much heat and moisture enters the atmosphere. They urged global ecologists to include the emerging role of dryland ecosystems in their research. 'Our study found that natural events in Australia were largely responsible for this anomaly,' Poulter said, referring to the spike in 2011. 'La Niña-driven rainfall during 2010 and 2011, as well as the 30-year greening up of its deserts and other drylands contributed to significant changes across the globe.' The team realised that the world's land carbon sinks in 2011 seemed to be absorbing an unusually large amount of carbon, Poulter said. Carbon dioxide moves constantly between land, oceans, vegetation and the atmosphere. When one of those absorbs more carbon dioxide than it releases, it's referred to as a carbon sink. Poulter and his collaborators investigated the phenomena with a variety of data sets and modeling approaches. They eventually discovered surprising interactions between climate extremes and desert greening that increased in importance over the past 30 years. Further study showed that the dryland systems in the Southern Hemisphere, specifically Australia, had particularly high productivity in response to increased La Niña-phase rainfall. In particular, the sink in Australia would have been aided by the 2010 to 2011 La Niña. After years of drought, the huge amount of rain would have given the Australian savannah a boost in plant growth, and thus carbon absorption. Philippe . Ciais, co-author and senior scientist at the Climate and Environment . Sciences Laboratory in (LSCE), said the team was 'surprised' that there . was no evidence of a similar event occuring in the past 30 years. This . suggested that the recent greening of drylands was responsible for some of the changes seen in carbon cycle dynamics. This world map shows global temperature anomalies in 2008 compared to the 1950 to 1980 baseline period. Large areas of the central and eastern Pacific Ocean were cooler than the long-term average, linked to a La Niña episode that began in 2007 . The authors discovered that certain ecosystems had become more sensitive to precipitation from 1982 to 1996 and 1997 to 2011. This seems to have been due to the greening of desert vegetation. The process led to a four-fold increase in net carbon uptake to precipitation over the past 30 years. 'Novel responses of the biosphere have been predicted to occur following human activities that have caused unprecedented changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, climate and land cover,' Poulter continued. 'Our study provides new evidence that interactions among these human activities are now also impacting dryland biomes. 'These findings have global implications that should be considered in monitoring networks and Earth system models.' But the large 2011 land carbon uptake is not expected to lead to long-term increases in ecosystem carbon accumulation, according to the researchers. 'Dryland systems have high rates of carbon turnover compared to other biomes,' Ciais said. 'We can expect the carbon to be quickly respired or consumed in wildfires, already partly reflected by the high atmospheric carbon dioxide growth rate in 2012.' Poulter and his colleagues will now be investigating the role of fire and invasive species in dryland systems to further understand the mechanisms for dryland greening and the consequences this will have on the carbon cycle.","New research suggests deserts could have a bigger role in climate change .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Ken Shuttleworth, an architects behind London's Gherkin skyscraper has branded the icon a 'mistake' London is in the midst of a love-affair with glass. On a sunny day, the glare from buildings such as the Shard, Cheesegrater and Walkie-Talkie can leave passers-by squinting as they head into the City. But now Ken Shuttleworth, the man behind London’s famous Gherkin skyscraper, claims this love affair has to come to an end, branding his famous landmark a ‘mistake.’ Mr Shuttleworth believes glass buildings, such as his Stirling Prize-winning design, no longer fit into a society where ‘man-made climate change’ is a concern. ‘It is a privilege to have a window. I think it should be seen as a privilege,’ he told Hannah Sander at the BBC. He claims that, in the age of austerity, developers should say goodbye to the excesses of architectural ‘bling’. And by far most important reason, he argues, is global warming. ‘As makers of the buildings that currently account for 60 per cent of human CO2 emissions, we all have a duty to respond with low carbon, low energy solutions,’ he said during a speech, only six years after the Gherkin was completed. Mr Shuttleworth believes glass buildings, such as his Gherkin design, no longer fit into a society where ‘man-made climate change’ is a key concern. There are currently plans underway to develop a number of other glass buildings in London, inlcuding the 'Can of Ham' and 'The Scalpel' Pictured is the Gherkin from the outside (left) and from inside (right). As well as the high cost of the material and unusual building shapes, one of the main concerns is that glass lets out, and lets in, a lot of heat.

Since leaving Foster and Partners in 2006, Mr Shuttleworth has set up his own architectural practice in which large windows are thought to be a luxury. ‘Everything I've done for the last 40 years I'm rethinking now,’ he told the BBC. ‘If you were designing [the Gherkin] today... it wouldn't be the same product all the way around the building. The danger of glare from glass buildings is also a concern.

Researchers have also been working over the past few years to create new types of glass and coatings that make the martial sustainable and safe. But Mr Shuttleworth believes architects need to take more responsibility in an age where climate change is at top of governments’ agendas. ‘The next generation will look back on the last few decades and think “what on earth were they thinking of? How could they have been so profligate?"",’ he said. Trade association Glass for Europe dismisses what they consider to be ‘a preconceived idea’ that glass is bad.

"By . Tom Rawstorne . Up in the back bedroom of a three-storey terrace house in a Northamptonshire town, a young couple have been busy making the most of the good weather to boost their online business. Where a bed and wardrobe should be, there are now filing cabinets filled with packs of pills and phials of liquid. On a nearby desk sit two computers and a stack of padded envelopes ready to deal with the flood of incoming orders. Exactly how much money this internet ‘pharmacy’ was turning over each week will no doubt emerge in time. But last week, when I accompanied a team of investigators from the medicines watchdog on an early-morning raid, more than £50,000-worth of illegal drugs were crammed into this one room alone. Slimming pills: Their main market is women desperate to find a quick-fix way of shedding the pounds ahead of their summer holidays . It became apparent who these banned medicines were targeted at as the team sifted through their haul — packet after packet of multi-coloured capsules in boxes branded with the image of a trim, young woman showing off her toned body in a crop-top and shorts. They are slimming pills and their main market at this time of year are women desperate to find a quick-fix way of shedding the pounds ahead of the summer holiday season. The trouble is that what is on offer here is banned in this country because the ingredients, manufactured in unregulated laboratories in China and India, could cause serious illness or death. ‘In the spring, women will go online and buy a couple of months’ worth of tablets which they think will help them fit into their bikini,’ explains Danny Lee-Frost, head of enforcement operations at the Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). ‘But buy from websites like these and you don’t know what you are getting — these pills can cause strokes and heart attacks. They are dangerous. ‘You also have no idea where this stuff is being manufactured or stored, and you cannot guarantee how much active ingredient each pill contains. In the past, we have raided places where different chemicals were being mixed up in cement mixers, with the stuff on the floor being swept up and shovelled back in. They just don’t care.’ And make no mistake, the sale of illegal diet pills and other banned medicines over the internet is big business. What is on offer here is banned in this . country because the ingredients, manufactured in unregulated . laboratories in China and India, could cause serious illness or death . In the UK over the course of the past few days, the MHRA and Home Office Border Force have seized some 3.6 million doses of medicine worth £9.5 million as part of a crackdown on the illegal internet trade in harmful counterfeit, unlicensed and adulterated medicines. They have also shut down almost 2,000 websites and removed nearly 20,000 links to these sites that were supported by social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. The nationwide haul included steroids, numerous types of erectile dysfunction products and a wide variety of slimming pills. The vast majority are bought in bulk from abroad, imported into Britain and sold on via the internet. In the raid I witnessed, the drugs had first been shipped to a mail-forwarding address in London and then on to the couple, both of whom are Polish immigrants, in Wellingborough. And it was from there that the pills were then sold via their website. Two of the products on offer — Slimex 15 and Slim Trim — contain sibutramine, a weight-loss drug previously available on prescription as Reductil. But in October 2010 it was withdrawn from the market and is now a controlled substance. Action was taken after some of those taking sibutramine reported adverse health effects, including raised blood pressure and pulse rate. There were also concerns it could pose a significant risk in patients with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, arrhythmias or strokes. Lilla Goatcher, 28, was prescribed slimming pills twice and had extreme reactions . Before it was banned in Britain, Lilla Goatcher, 28, was among those to be prescribed the drug — and experienced first-hand its worrying side-effects. Lilla, of Hove, East Sussex, first tried it as a teenager after her weight climbed to 13st. Despite trying conventional diets and joining Weight . Watchers and Slimming World, she could not shift the pounds. Her doctor suggested she try Reductil. The pills work as an appetite suppressant, and over the course of the two months that Lilla was taking the drug she lost a stone. But all the time she was battling against deeply unpleasant side-effects. ‘For the first couple of weeks it wasn’t too bad — a racing heart as if I had drunk far too much coffee,’ says Lilla, who is now married and works in digital marketing. ‘But then I started not to be able to sleep and would be up all night. That was followed by really excruciating stomach ache and pains in my chest which in the end got so bad I decided to stop taking the pills.’ Despite that experience, Lilla was once again prescribed the pills shortly before they were banned in 2010. This time she requested a lower dosage — but even so she suffered as before. ‘I started having heart palpitations and once again couldn’t get to sleep,’ she says. ‘I couldn’t concentrate and started to feel terribly light-headed. The reaction was still quite extreme.’ After a month, she binned the remaining tablets and was not at all surprised subsequently to learn that Reductil had been withdrawn from sale in the UK and many other countries around the world. She was lucky the health problems she suffered were only temporary. Two years ago, an 18-year-old girl from Dublin who bought slimming pills online containing sibutramine ended up fighting for her life. After just five days taking the pills, the teenager developed ischaemic colitis, a severe swelling of blood vessels supplying the intestines. It rarely occurs in young women and resulted in her having her colon surgically removed. The girl, who was not named, was not overweight. She told doctors she had bought the drugs to ‘tone up’ for a holiday. It is not just pills containing sibutramine that are causing concern. The MHRA is seeing increasing online sales of ‘herbal’ and traditional Chinese slimming medicines. Some of these concoctions contain dangerous levels of heavy metals such as mercury, arsenic and lead. After just five days taking the pills, . the teenager developed ischaemic colitis, a severe swelling of blood . vessels supplying the intestines . The herbal medicines often contain some sort of active ingredient which is not disclosed on the labelling. This month the MHRA has issued warnings about three products found to contain undeclared prescription-only ingredients. A recent batch, aimed at women, was found to contain sildenafil, the active ingredient of Viagra. These pills won’t help with slimming but will give a reaction, such as facial flushing, which dupe the consumer into thinking they are working. Other herbal medicines have been found to contain substances such as the plant extract ephedra, which is classed as a prescription-only medicine in the UK because of the serious side-effects it can cause. These include insomnia, psychosis and heart palpitations leading to serious cardiac complications. Of course, the added risk when buying online is that it is impossible to know how strong the pills are, what they contain and how the individual will react to them. It is something 31-year-old dance teacher Samantha Ntritsou, from the West Midlands, learned to her cost when she bought slimming pills from eBay. Although she was a size 12 and weighed 10st, she was keen to lose weight around her stomach. Samantha Ntritsou, 31, who experienced psychotic episodes after taking a course of slimming pills that she bought online . ‘I paid £90 for three months’ supply,’ she says. ‘It was a lot of money but I thought it would be well worth it. When they arrived in the post I couldn’t wait to get started.’ But shortly after beginning the course, Samantha began to notice a change in how she felt. ‘I was full of excess energy,’ she says. ‘I began to feel constantly agitated, too, I kept snapping at my family and I couldn’t sleep.’ Stranger behaviour also began to manifest itself. Samantha started to experience feelings of paranoia. Convinced she was being spied upon, she suffered a breakdown. ‘At the hospital I totally freaked out,’ she says. ‘I was screaming and running around the wards where patients were sleeping.’ Hospital security were called and wrestled her to the ground. The police were summoned and Samantha was sectioned to a psychiatric ward where she was given sleeping pills and mood stabilisers. I had done humiliating things and put my . family through hell — all because I had wanted to be thin. I’d developed paranoid psychosis just so I could get a flat . stomach . Samantha Ntritsou . At first, doctors believed she might be bi-polar until a paramedic discovered the slimming pills — and that they contained ephedra. They quickly linked the drug to her behaviour. After two weeks, Samantha was allowed home with daily visits from a psychiatric nurse. Three months later the fuzzy unreality gave way to a shocking truth. ‘I had done humiliating things and put my family through hell — all because I had wanted to be thin,’ she recalls. ‘I’d developed paranoid psychosis just so I could get a flat stomach. ‘My parents were wonderfully supportive, but many of my friends dropped me or shied away. I was dating a man, but he didn’t contact me again after I was sectioned.’ In the six years since, Samantha has made a full, if slow, recovery and got married recently. ‘I haven’t had any long-term psychiatric problems,’ she said. ‘But it took a year to put my life back together. I’m lucky — if that paramedic hadn’t discovered my pills, I might still be in that unit and on heavy-duty medication for life.’ The fear is that given the scale of the trade in these drugs on the internet — and the lengths people are prepared to go to lose weight — others will be less fortunate.","Main market are women desperate to find a quick-fix .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Apple has weeded out a popular game from its app store that sees users try and create a successful marijuana-growing empire. Weed Firm had become the No1 game on the App Store in all categories. However, the game was pulled on Tuesday with Apple yet to explain why. Rejected: Weed Firm was removed from Apple's App Store on Tuesday . There are currently dozens of marijuana-themed games on the App Store including Weed Strains 3D, Weed Tycoon and Weed Memory Game. Though Apple did reject a similar game to Weed Firm called Herb Converter. In Weed Firm players control a character called Mr Ted Growing, who interacts with other drug dealers and sells his produce for the highest price possible. The game’s developer, Manitoba, posted a statement on its website following the rejection of the app that was attributed to Mr Grower. Aim of the game: In Weed Firm players control a character called Mr Ted Growing, who interacts with other drug dealers . It said: ‘As you might have noticed the game is no longer available on the Apple App Store. This was entirely Apple's decision, not ours. ‘One thing we can promise you is that we will be back! The Apple version might need to be censored a bit to comply with Apple's strictest requirement since they are going to be looking very attentively at what we submit from now on.’ It said sarcastically: 'We guess the problem was that the game was just too good.' The game is also banned from Google’s Play Store, but the statement explained that the app itself wasn’t the problem. It added: ‘Google never had a problem with the application itself. The problem was with our publisher and we are expecting to return to the Play Store once we find a suitable publisher.’ Apple isn’t just sensitive to drug themes. Apps that feature famous people, nudity and even radiation detection have been banned. Obama Trampoline, in which players bounce politicians around the Oval Office, was banned because Apple does not approve of ridiculing public figures. Tawkon Radiation Detector, meanwhile, which calculates exposure to electromagnetic radiation from phones, was rejected as Apple was concerned that it could cause alarm. And Pocket Girlfriend, where users can interact with semi-nude women, was banned for being demeaning.","Weed Firm had become the No1 game on the App Store in all categories .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . It is as if the landscape is dotted with freckles. Huge swathes of grassland in Namibia is covered with mysterious vegetation-free patches that have been baffling scientists for decades. While a number of studies have suggested the fairy circles are created by industrious termites, new research claims they are the result of resource competition for water among plants. German researchers analysed the spatial . distribution of the fairy circles and found that they are ‘remarkably . regular’ in their distribution, which made them question the termite . theory. A freckled landscape: Has the mystery of the fairy circles finally been solved? While a number of studies have suggested they are created by industrious termites, new research claims they are the result of resource competition for water among plants . Experts from various institutions have previously claimed that termites nibble away at grassroots in certain grasslands of southwest Africa, causing the dieback of vegetation and creating a water trap. Other theories to explain the circles - which can measure anything between 10ft and 65ft (a few metres in diameter to 20metres) - include hydrocarbons emanating from the depths of the earth to kill off patches of vegetation and some people even think they are made by aliens. German researchers analysed the spatial distribution of the fairy circles (pictured in the Marienfluss Valley) and found that they are 'remarkably regular' in their distribution. This is a close-up of a fairy circle. There is a no vegetation growth within the circular area . Scientists claimed in 2013 that the sand termite species Psammotermes allocerus was the most likely suspect for creating the fairy circles. Norbert Jürgens from the University of Hamburg said the insect was the only species consistently present across the 1,200 miles of desert which included the circles. His theory centres around the termites eating plant roots before they can sprout through the desert soil creating a water trap - in a similar way that beavers create dams. Because of the lack of foliage, rainwater is not lost through transpiration - the evaporation of water from plants - and instead stays below the surface. This allows the sand termites to survive and stay active during the dry season and also helps grasses at the edge of the circle to thrive attracting other life forms. The termites feed on those grasses, thereby gradually extending the circle. Dr Jürgens concluded that the fairy circles are an astounding example of ecological engineering by the sand termite, designed to retain precious water in an otherwise arid landscape. However, no one has so far observed these creatures actually grazing holes into the Namibian grasslands – let alone in such consistent patterns. Dr Getzin said: ‘There is, up to now, not one single piece of evidence demonstrating that social insects are capable of creating homogenously distributed structures, on such a large scale.’ In fact, a range of studies covering the distribution of ant and termite populations in arid territories suggests they create random and irregular patterns. ‘Although scientists have been trying to . answer this question for decades their mystery remains as yet . unresolved,’ Stephan Getzin from the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental . Research (UFZ) in Leipzig said. No one has been able to observe the genesis of a fairy circle. Their occurrence appears to be restricted to particularly arid zones right at the border of grassland and desert regions, according to the study published in the journal Ecography. There is intense resource-competition for water. Dr Getzin's team was joined by experts from Göttingen in Germany, Italy and Israel who studied aerial images of the circles in north west Namibia to pinpoint the location and distribution of the barren patches within the surrounding landscape. Using statistical methods, they found that the circles are distributed regularly across large areas. ‘The occurrence of such patterning in nature is rather unusual. There must be particularly strong regulating forces at work,’ Dr Getzin said. He believes it is the local resource-competition among plants and vegetation, in a similar way to how young trees space themselves out in forests to ensure they have access to enough nutrients and water. ‘A similar process of resource-competition may consequently also be the real cause for a self-organising formation of the mysterious fairy circle patterns,’ the study says. The scientists simulated underground competition for water and the spatial vegetation distribution patterns. They found that similar patterns emerged on the screen to those recorded in Namibia. Termite trouble: Experts from various institutions have previously claimed that termites nibble away at grassroots in certain grasslands of southwest Africa, causing the dieback of vegetation and creating a water trap. This pile of sand is typical of the markings made by termites .","The fairy circles are regularly spaced across the Namibian grassland .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Almost 1,500 years after his death, a rare seal has been discovered bearing a striking resemblance to religious figure St. Sabas - also known as Mar Saba. The lead seal consists of two discs connected by string that would have been used to close letters from Mar Saba's monastery during the Crusades. One disc reveals the figure of Mar Saba, holding a cross in his right hand, while the other side features the inscription: 'This is the seal of the Laura of the Holy Sabas,' written in Greek. The lead seal consists of two disks connected by string that would have been used to close letters during the Crusades in Jerusalem. One disk, pictured left, reveals the figure of Mar Saba, stock image pictured right, wearing a himation drape and holding a cross in his right hand . St. Sabas was an important Christian leader in the Judean desert during the Byzantine Empire, and was the founder of several monasteries. He is best known for the construction of the Monastery of St. Sabas, known as the Great Laura, overlooking Nahal Kidron. The second disk, pictured, features the inscription: 'This is the seal of the Laura of the Holy Sabas, ' written in Greek . Archaeologists from the Israel Antiquities Authority made the discovery in 2012 while excavating a site at Horbat Mizmil in Bayit Vegan, Jerusalem. Up until 1948, Horbat Mizmil was an Arab village, but it is now being redeveloped. Researchers discovered the site was abandoned at the end of the Byzantine period before being occupied again during the Crusades, and up to the 15th century Mamlux period. The seal was found on the remains of a farm on this land, buried in a layer of earth believed to date back to the 11th and 12th century. The lead discs would have been used to seal letters closed using wax, and researchers claim it is in 'excellent condition'. When sealing the letter, the two discs were pressed together, creating the double-faced seal.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Kawasaki disease affects over 12,000 children a year in Japan and now scientists are one step closer to understanding one of the world’s most mysterious illnesses. Experts have found that the disease is deadliest when the wind blows from north eastern China, suggesting that it is caused by an airborne toxin that originates from the region. However, more research is needed the pinpoint which toxin it could be. The answer is blowing in the wind? Kawasaki disease affects over 12,000 children a year in Japan and experts might be one step closer to understanding the disease, which triggers a rash (pictured left) and peeling of the skin on hands (right) as they think it is caused by an airborne toxin originating from north eastern China . The disease strikes children in Japan, the U.S. and South Korea, who are most at threat before their fifth birthday. Symptoms of the disease include a red rash, fever, swelling and peeling of the skin on the hands and feet. Left untreated, it can cause internal bleeding and heart attacks. Some scientists are divided as to whether Kawasaki is an infection or an immune response to a toxin. The new study built on previous work that suggested that large cases of the disease coincide with prevailing winds from Central Asia, Science Mag reported. Mathematical ecologist Xavier Rodó of the Catalan Institute for Climate Sciences in Barcelona, Spain, studied Japanese health records between 1970 and 2010 to pinpoint the days on which the most cases were identified in Tokyo and other large cities. The experts used computer models to find out where the air had come from in the previous few days and discovered that on the days most children became ill, the air had come from the same region in north west China (marked in red as well as Japan and South Korea where cases of Kawasaki disease were reported). The air typically took two days to reach Japan, where the children became sick half a day later . His team used computer models of airflow to find out where the air had come from in the previous few days and discovered that on the days most children became ill, the air originated from the same region in north west China. The air typically took two days to reach Japan, where the children became sick half a day later, according to the study in PNAS. From the study, the researchers have surmised that the disease is airborne and has an incubation period of just half a day. They ruled out the possibility that Kawasaki is an infection that spreads between children, because the vast majority of youngsters in large cities fell ill on the same days. The disease strikes children in Japan, the U.S. and South Korea, who are most at threat before their fifth birthday. Symptoms of the disease include a red rash, fever and peeling of the skin on the hands and feet (pictured left and right). Left untreated, it can cause internal bleeding and heart attacks . The peak of the infection also died away when the wind changed direction and did not follow a typical pattern for a contagious infection. ‘It must be in the form of a toxin or some other environmental agent,’ Dr Rodó said. The region thought to be the source of the toxin – the Northeast China Plain - is highly agricultural so it is suspected that the toxin could be made by a fungus living on crops. The experts collected air samples by flying in the opposite direction to the prevailing winds. They found lots of species of Candida - a fungus genus responsible for common human infections – but the scientists are not claiming this fungus is the root of the problem.","Experts from the Catalan Institute for Climate Sciences in Barcelona studied incidences of Kawasaki Disease and winds .

"By . Mark Prigg . April was the joint hottest on record globally, forecasters have revealed. The combined average temperature over global land and ocean surfaces for April 2014 tied with 2010 as the highest on record for the month, at 0.77°C (1.39°F) above the 20th century average of 13.7°C (56.7°F). Researchers today said a sweltering summer is on the cards as the El Nino weather phenomenon is set to return - but say it could also result in fewer hurricanes. April across the world: The combined average temperature over global land and ocean surfaces for April 2014 tied with 2010 as the highest on record for the month, at 0.77°C (1.39°F) above the 20th century average of 13.7°C (56.7°F). El Niño refers to a set of conditions when the surface of the sea in an area along the Equator in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean becomes hotter than usual. The average water temperature in that area is typically between 1 and 3°C (approximately 2 and 5°F) warmer than normal during this event. This has the effect of adding huge amounts of heat and moisture into the atmosphere, ultimately affecting patterns of air pressure and rainfall across the Pacific and globally. Strong El Niño events occur every 20 years or so, but researchers recently said this could drop to 10 years thanks to global warming. At the opposite end of the scale, La Niña is the climatological counterpart to El Niño. La Niña refers to periods when sea-surface temperatures around the Equator are cooler than normal. This has a similar affect on air pressure and rainfall because it suppresses how much heat and moisture enters the atmosphere. A slower-than-usual hurricane season is expected this year because of an expected El Nino, forecasters said - but they warned that it takes only one storm to wreak havoc and urged Americans to be prepared. The El Nino, which warms part of the Pacific every few years and changes rain and temperature patterns around the world, will likely reduce the number and intensity of tropical storms and hurricanes, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in New York City. Cooler temperatures on the surface of the Atlantic Ocean compared with recent years will also lower the probability of hurricane formation. Officials expect about eight to 13 named tropical storms and three to six hurricanes. Just one or two major hurricanes with winds over 110 miles per hour are forecast. The six-month storm season begins June 1. Forecasters got it wrong last year when they predicted an unusually busy hurricane season. There were just 13 named storms and two hurricanes, Umberto and Ingrid, both of which were Category 1, the lowest on the scale that measures hurricanes by wind speed. There were no major hurricanes. In 2012, storm surge was devastating to the New York area when Superstorm Sandy slammed the East coast, killing 147 people and causing $50 billion in damage. Sandy lost hurricane status when it made landfall in New Jersey. Person Walking in Hurricane Andrew: A slower-than-usual hurricane season is expected this year because of an expected El Nino, forecasters said . A new mapping tool this year will keep coastal residents updated on the storm surge threat in their communities. The Atlantic hurricane season goes through cycles of high and low activity about every 25 to 40 years based on large scale climatic patterns in the atmosphere. Since 1995, an average season has 15 named tropical storms, eight hurricanes and about four major storms. The last time a major hurricane made landfall in the U.S. was when Wilma came ashore in 2005, an eight-year stretch that is the longest on record. During the six-month season, forecasters name tropical storms when top winds reach 39 mph; hurricanes have maximum winds of at least 74 mph. However, Meteorologists are predicting that the weather will go wild later this year. The cause is El Niño, a warming of sea-surface temperatures in the Pacific, which can trigger both floods and drought in different parts of the world. But while scientists are anticipating a stronger-than-usual El Niño, many are warning that the planet is ill prepared to deal with the consequences. A spike in Pacific Ocean sea temperatures and the rapid movement of warm water eastwards have increased fears this year's El Niño could be one of the strongest yet. El Niño, pictured left, is a warming of sea temperatures that can trigger floods and droughts. La Niña, pictured right, is when sea temperatures drop . The more heat in the Pacific, the large the El Niño and right now a ball of warm water is crossing the ocean 490ft (150 metres) below the surface. A majority of weather forecasting models indicate that the phenomenon may develop around the middle of the year, but it was too early to assess its likely strength, the U.N. World Meteorological Organisation said on 15 April. Meteorologists claim the prospect of an El Niño will likely be firmed up 'in the next month or two', although forecasting its strength will be hard to do. The chance of it developing in 2014 exceeded 70 per cent according to Australia's Bureau of Meteorology. But according to a report in New Scientist, some El Niño researchers say forecasters are being too conservative. ‘One thing I hear over and over again is 'we do not want to create a panic', Axel Timmermann of the University of Hawaii in Honolulu told the magazine. One reason is that forecasting a big El Niño would increase food prices. ‘But it may be better to have this reaction at an early stage, when farmers can still adapt, rather than later,’ he said. The worst El Niño on record in 1997 to 1998 was blamed for massive flooding along China's Yangtze river, pictured, that killed over 1,500 people. Australian climate experts claim the recent rises in sea temperature are above those seen in previous El Niño years and suggest this year's events will be 'significant' Researchers claim that California, which faces floods, is well prepared for emergencies. India is thought to have invested in water storage in event of a drought. Scientists' main concern is Central and South America, Asia and Australia. The worst El Niño on record in 1997 and 1998 was blamed for massive flooding along China's Yangtze river, responsible for killing more than 1,500 people. A strong El Niño also increases fears that production of many key agricultural commodities in Asia and Australia will suffer. Strong El Niño events occur every 20 years or so, but researchers recently said this could drop to 10 years thanks to global warming. Here, the village of Puerto Maldonado, Peru, is seen flooded in January 2003 as a result of El Niño rains, which drove 16,000 people from their homes . The impact of this year's El Niño events is expected to be felt by every continent. During the 1997 to 1998 events, damages were said to have been in the region of between $35billion to $45billion. Beachfront homes in Malibu, California, pictured, collapsed after two weeks of high surf under El Niño weather conditions . Extreme El Niño events develop differently from standard El Niños, which first appear in the western Pacific. The extreme events occur when sea surface temperatures exceeding 28°C develop in the normally cold and dry eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. This different location for the origin of the temperature increase causes massive changes in global rainfall patterns. The new patterns result in flash floods and torrential rain in some places and devastating droughts and wild fires in others. Extreme El Niño events are expected to double in frequency over the next 100 years. The impact of extreme El Niño events is felt by every continent. In January, a team of international . scientists said extreme weather events fuelled by unusually strong El . Niños are expected to double over the next century. Climate . scientists warned countries could be struck by devastating droughts, . wild fires and dramatic foods approximately every ten years. The team, made up of experts from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science (CoECSS), the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and CSIRO, also  spotted a link between global warming and extreme El Niño events. ‘We currently experience an unusually strong El Niño event every 20 years. Our research shows this will double to one event every 10 years,’ said Agus Santoso of CoECSS, who co-authored the study. ‘El Niño events are a multi-dimensional problem and only now are we starting to understand better how they respond to global warming,’ he added. Extreme El Niño events develop differently from standard El Niños, which first appear in the western Pacific. The extreme events occur when sea surface temperatures exceeding 28°C develop in the normally cold and dry eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. Scientists in Germany recently said they can forecast disruptive El Niño events a year in advance. They hope the forecast will help countries develop better strategies to counter the effects such as wild fires, pictured in the Philippines. Meteorologists said the prospect of a 2014 El Niño will be firmed up 'in the next month or two' This different location for the origin of the temperature increase causes massive changes in global rainfall patterns, which result in floods and torrential rain in some places and devastating droughts and wild fires in others. The impacts of extreme El Niño events that extended to every continent across the globe in 1997, for example, killed around 23,000 people. Dr Cai continued: ‘During an extreme El Niño event countries in the western Pacific, such as Australia and Indonesia, experienced devastating droughts and wild fires, while catastrophic floods occurred in the eastern equatorial region of Ecuador and northern Peru.’ In Australia, the drought and dry . conditions caused by the 1982 and 1983 extreme El Niño led to the Ash . Wednesday Bushfire in southeast Australia, which resulted in 75 deaths. The scientists examined 20 climate models to simulate major rainfall reorganisation during extreme El Niño events.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . PetMatch uses photos to search for similar-looking animals in the local area that are up for adoption . If cloning your recently deceased pet is a step too far, an app will now find an almost near replica. Called PetMatch, it uses images of either an old pet, an animal that belongs to a friend, or just a favourite breed to search for similar ones nearby. The app only searches for animals that are up for adoption in the user’s local area, and as a result the service is only available in certain areas. PetMatch was launched by Californian start-up Superfish, which specialises in image search algorithms. Animals lovers upload a photo to PetMatch, or use a sample image from the gallery, and the app will search a database of pets for animals with similar features. It uses Superfish’s patented image recognition technology to perform what’s called geometric analysis. This includes scanning images to plot and match the distance between the animal’s eyes, the angle of its mouth, its face shape and its colour. Users can then browse a list of potential matches before clicking through to a profile and learning more about the dog, and the centre where it is up for adoption. These results can be filtered by similarity or distance, and favourite images can be stored for later. The app uses image recognition technology to perform what's called geometric analysis.

In April, scientists produced the first cloned dog in Britain after its owner won a competition to have her elderly pet replicated. Rebecca Smith, 29, from west London, put her elderly dachshund, Winnie, forward to be cloned in a £60,000 competition organised by South Korean tech firm, Sooam Biotech.

"By . Mark Prigg . A New York partygoer has spoken of his shock after being hit by a drone at a hi-tech 'home of the future' party. Publisher Stephen Kosloff tweeted shocking images from the party, organised by gadget website Gizmodo, of his blood-stained t- shirt after an out of control drone hit him in the head. The drone, which is believed to have had technical problems, hit Kosloff in the ear and forehead. Stephen Kosloff (right) was hit by the drone at a Manhattan party showing off hi-tech toys. His encouter left him shocked and covered in blood - although he admitted he simply carried on with his night out. 'I am now the only person I know who was wounded by a #drone at a @Gizmodo party. #tech' he tweeted. 'A few folks had the drone on a table, and they fired it up again,' Kosloff told The Awl . 'Next thing I know, WHAM!!!!!!! Right in my f**king head. The drone.' 'The ordeal was 'mildly upsetting; not very painful, but a big shock, ' he said. 'It knocked me pretty good.' The drone that hit Stephen Kosloff at the Gizmodo party. However, he admits the ordeal did not ruin his evening, and praised staff at the event, who helped him. 'but I'm not washing the shirt,' he tweeted. 'When people ask about the blood I can say 'I was hit in the head by a drone.'' However, he did have some advice for party planners. 'Drones make bad party toys'. Quadcopters have become an increasingly common sight, with dozens of manufacturers producing low cost versions that can be used for everything from surveillance to walking dogs.","Publisher was hit by drone at Manhattan party .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . The ability to discern pitch and to hear the difference between similar-sounding words relies on specialised cells within the inner ear, which can be damaged. For the first time, scientists have discovered what controls the cells’ development and pattering. They studied the development of these cells in chickens, which unlike humans, have the capacity to regrow sound-detecting cells after suffering hearing loss. Scientists have discovered what controls the development and pattering of cells in the inner ear. They studies their development in chickens, which can regenerate damaged cells. A coloured microgram of the hair cells that detect pitch are pictured, with stereocilia (hair-like microscopic protrusions) in blue . Pitch detection occurs within the cochlea, which is a small spiral structure within the inner ear. Inside the cochlea are specialised cells, known as hair cells, which are tuned to different sound pitches based in part, on their locations along the cochlea’s spiral and the number and the length of their stereocilia, which are hair-like microscopic protrusions that give the cells their name. High-pitched sounds are detected by cells with shorter hair bundles, located closest to where sound enters the ear, while lower-pitched sounds are detected by cells with taller hair bundles located further in. This pattern progresses through the several thousand hair cells that are essential for hearing. Not every single hair cell in the cochlea responds to sounds – only the ones that are sensitive to specific frequencies respond. A study by the University of Virginia School of Medicine and the National Institute on Deafness and Communication Disorders says that if scientists understand what causes chickens’ cells to redevelop they could one day replicate the process in humans to reverse hearing loss. Jeffrey Corwin of the university said that if both a human and a hen were to be exposed to a sound loud enough to destroy the ability to hear a certain pitch, the outcomes would be very different. ‘We would lose the ability to hear that sound for the rest of our lives. 'The bird also would lose the ability, but within 10 days, it would have its cells back – they would hook back up to the nerves and within a few weeks its hearing would be back and almost indistinguishable from before.’ ‘Eventually therapies [for humans] will come about from this regenerative approach and these new discoveries will be a critical component,’ he said.

Experts believe that if they can understand what causes chickens' cells to redevelop, they could replicate the process in humans, which could potentially reverse hearing loss one day . High-pitched sounds are detected by cells with shorter hair bundles, located closest to where sound enters the ear, while lower-pitched sounds are detected by cells with taller hair bundles located further in. This pattern progresses through the several thousand hair cells that are essential for hearing. Benjamin Thiede, lead author of the two papers, which are published in Nature Communications, explained: ‘When you hear different sounds, not every single hair cell in the cochlea is responding - only the ones that are sensitive to the specific sound frequencies.’ Until now, scientists have not understood what orchestrates the formation of this pattern of individually distinct hair cells. But now they have solved that mystery, demonstrating that two specific molecules - Bmp7 and retinoic acid - guide cells to acquire location-specific attributes. Bmp7 starts the initial patterning process and retinoic acid regulates how the cells’ hair bundles grow to different lengths. Dr Thiede found evidence that there are different levels of retinoic acid activity along the length of the cochlea, so he tried adding more retinoic acid in cells grown in a lab dish and found that they produced longer hair bundles. Then he used a drug to block retinoic acid’s activity and found that resulted in shorter bundles. He noted that when chickens regenerate damaged hair cells, the new cells develop with just the right characteristics for cells in those particular locations along the cochlea. ‘So the question is, are developmental signals like Bmp7 and retinoic acid involved in re-establishing the pattern of hair cells and restoring hearing to the regenerating cochlea?’ he asked. He believes the creation of signals for reactivating regeneration of the molecules is a ‘tantalising’ path for developing new treatments for hearing loss.","Scientists at the University of Virginia have discovered what controls chickens' inner ear cells’ development and pattering .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . A mineral discovered on Mars could suggest there may have been past life on the red planet. Scientists have discovered that the earliest living organisms on Earth were capable of creating this mineral, which may hint that similar microbes were able to do the same on Mars. Named stevensite, the clay mineral has been used since ancient times by Nubian women in Egypt as a beauty treatment. A mineral discovered on Mars could suggest there may have been past life on the red planet. Scientists have found that the earliest living organisms on Earth were capable of creating this mineral, named Stevensite. Pictured is the late Dr Linda Moore from the Australian National University sampling microbes . But up until now, scientists had believed deposits of the mineral could only be formed in harsh conditions like volcanic lava and hot alkali lakes. Researchers led by Dr Bob Burne from the Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra have now found living microbes create an environment that allows stevensite to form, raising new questions about the stevensite found on Mars. Stevensite can be found on Mars, and in some places on Earth. The clay mineral has been used since ancient times by Nubian women as a beauty treatment. But up until now, scientists had believed deposits could only be formed in harsh conditions like volcanic lava and hot alkali lakes . ‘It's much more likely that the stevensite on Mars is made geologically, from volcanic activity,’ Dr Burne said. Stevensite can be found on Mars, and in some places on Earth. The clay mineral has been used since ancient times by Nubian women as a beauty treatment. But up until now, scientists had believed deposits could only be formed in harsh conditions like volcanic lava and hot alkali lakes. The latest study found that microbes can become encrusted by stevensite to create ‘microbialites’. Microbialites are the earliest large-scale evidence of life on Earth . ‘But our finding – that stevensite can form around biological organisms – will encourage re-interpretation of these Martian deposits and their possible links to life on that planet.’ Dr Burne and his colleagues found microbes can become encrusted by stevensite, which protects their delicate insides and provides the rigidity to allow them to build reef-like structures called ‘microbialites’. ‘Microbialites are the earliest large-scale evidence of life on Earth,’ Dr Burne said. ‘They demonstrate how microscopic organisms are able to join together to build enormous structures that sometimes rivalled the size of today's coral reefs.’ He said the process still happens today in some isolated places like Shark Bay and Lake Clifton in Western Australia. ‘Stevensite is usually assumed to require highly alkaline conditions to form, such as volcanic soda lakes. But our stevensite microbialites grow in a lake less salty than seawater and with near-neutral pH,’ he added. ‘It's much more likely that the stevensite on Mars is made geologically, from volcanic activity,’ said Bob Burne from the Australian National University. ‘But our finding – that stevensite can form around biological organisms – will encourage re-interpretation of these Martian deposits and their possible links to life on that planet’ The discovery of microbes once living on Mars is key to understanding whether life once flourished on the red planet. In a separate study, researchers have shown that some of the simplest and oldest organisms on our planet could also survive on the Martian surface. Named methanogens, these organisms use hydrogen and carbon dioxide to metabolise and produce methane. Methanogens live in swamps and marshes, but can also be found in the gut of cattle and termites, as well as in dead and decaying animals. These ancient and highly-specialised ‘extremophiles’ are thought to be able to grow quickly in harsh conditions. They are anaerobic, so they don't require oxygen. They also don't require organic which suggests they could exist in sub-surface environments. In a separate study, researchers have shown that some of the simplest and oldest organisms on our planet could also survive on the Martian surface. amed methanogens, these organisms use hydrogen and carbon dioxide to metabolise and produce methane . Researchers from the University of Arkansas wanted to see if two species of methanogens could withstand Martian freeze-thaw cycles below the organisms’ ideal growth temperatures. Methanothermobacter wolfeii was placed in a chamber 55°C (131°F) and Methanobacterium formicicum in one at 37°C (98.6°F). The two species were selected because one is a hyperthermophile, meaning it thrives under extremely hot temperatures, and the other is a thermophile, which thrives under warm temperatures. ‘The surface temperature on Mars varies widely, often ranging between -90°C and 27°C over one Martian day,’ said Rebecca Mickol, a doctoral student at the University of Arkansas. ‘If any life were to exist on Mars right now, it would at least have to survive that temperature range. ‘The survival of these two methanogen species exposed to long-term freeze/thaw cycles suggests methanogens could potentially inhabit the subsurface of Mars.’","Study found microbes can become encrusted by the mineral stevensite .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Space scientist Colin Pillinger has had a mountain feature on Mars named after him by NASA. The US space agency has been steering a robotic rover called Opportunity on Mars and has christened a rocky ridge Pillinger Point. The mutton-chopped, Bristol-born professor died in Cambridge earlier this month of a brain haemorrhage, aged 70. Tribute: NASA has paid tribute to Bristol-born Colin Pillinger with 'Pillinger's Point' on Mars . His UK-built probe Beagle 2 crashed when it reached Mars on Christmas Day, 2003. Pillinger Point is an outcrop of ancient rock high on the slopes above Endeavour Crater. NASA is keen to study it in detail to learn more about Mars’ early history. Although ill-fated, Beagle 2 touched the hearts of the public. Built in the UK, it would have sent back pictures and analysis of the planet's surface. Opportunity arrived there a month later with a sister rover, Spirit, to explore the martian surface. Professor Pillinger said the most important spin-off from the mission was to be able to build an instrument capable of being deployed to remote parts of Africa to help tuberculosis sufferers. He said: 'You don't spend any money in space. That money is invested in knowledge and technology that can be used for a variety of other things.' In 2005, Prof Pillinger, then 62, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, a disease of the nervous system. NASA hopes to study Pillinger Point to learn more about the planet's early history (picture of landscape in 1976) He said he had been diagnosed with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS), which meant he was likely to face a steady decline. But he was always keen to try another British to Mars and reignite interest in the planet in the public. 'We have unfinished business on Mars,' he said. 'The science is more important now than it ever was because of discoveries that were made with Mars Express, the Nasa rovers and ground-based astronomy. 'It all suggests that we were right to look for life on Mars and we might be able to find both past and present life, and the experiments haven't been done yet and it's up to us to do them.'

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Silly Putty: one of the world's most popular toys and now, also, a novel way to make your phone hold a charge for longer? That's according to a group of researchers in the Riverside Bourns College of Engineering at the University of California. They've developed a way to use the material found in the toy and surgical tubes to make lithium-ion batteries that last three times longer between charges compared to the current standard. A team of researchers from the University of California have created a lithium-ion battery that they say lasts three times longer the current industry standard using material found in Silly Putty. Pictured is the silicon polymer and battery used for the research . The team created silicon dioxide (SiO2) nanotube anodes for lithium-ion batteries and found they had over three times as much energy storage capacity as the carbon-based anodes currently being used. Silly Putty was one of the most popular toys of the 20th century, a result of an 'accident' during the Second World War. It was invented by engineer James Wright in New Haven, Connecticut in 1943 as he was attempting to create a synthetic rubber. The . result was not able to replace rubber - but its unusual qualities, the . ability to flow like a liquid, bounce like a ball, or break given a . sharp blow, made it a popular toy. By 1987, two million Silly Putty eggs were sold every year. The . mass is composed of 65 per cent dimethyl siloxane (hydroxy-terminated . polymers with boric acid), 17 per cent silica (crystalline quartz), nine . per cent Thixatrol ST (castor oil derivative), four per cent . polydimethylsiloxane, one per cent decamethyl cyclopentasiloxane, one . per cent glycerine, and one per cent titanium dioxide. The researchers say this has significant implications for industries including electronics and electric vehicles, which are always trying to squeeze longer discharges out of batteries. 'We are taking the same material used in kids' toys and medical devices and even fast food and using it to create next generation battery materials,' said Zachary Favors, the lead author of a paper on the research. The paper, Stable Cycling of SiO2 Nanotubes as High-Performance Anodes for Lithium-Ion Batteries, was published online in the journal Nature Scientific Reports. It was co-authored by Cengiz S. Ozkan, a mechanical engineering professor, Mihrimah Ozkan, an electrical engineering professor, and several of their current and former graduate students: Wei Wang, Hamed Hosseinni Bay, Aaron George and Favors. The team originally focused on silicon dioxide because it is an extremely abundant compound, environmentally friendly, non-toxic, and found in many other products. Silicon dioxide has previously been used as an anode material in lithium ion batteries, but the ability to synthesize the material into highly uniform exotic nanostructures with high energy density and long cycle life has been limited. There key finding was that the silicon dioxide nanotubes are extremely stable in batteries, which is important because it means a longer lifespan. Specifically, SiO2 nanotube anodes were cycled 100 times without any loss in energy storage capability and the authors are highly confident that they could be cycled hundreds more times. The researchers are now focused on developing methods to scale up production of the SiO2 nanotubes in hopes they could become a commercially viable product.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . The famous battle took place nearly 1,000 years ago, but the badly scarred skull of a man could be the first-ever recorded victim of the Battle of Hastings. Experts have revealed that it belongs to a 45-year-old man who was hacked six times with a sword to the back of his head – and could provide first-hand evidence of the brutal battle of 1066. No bones have previously been discovered of anyone who fought and died during the historic event. Battle scarred: The badly damaged skull of a man (pictured) could be the first-ever recorded victim of the Battle of Hastings. Experts have revealed that it belongs to a 45-year-old man who was hacked six times with a sword to the back of his head . The skeleton belongs to a 45-year-old man and was found in Lewes, Sussex. Scientists believe the man was likely to have been involved in fighting at the time of the Norman invasion and the Battle of Hastings. His skull shows that he was hacked six times with a sword at the back of his head. One osteoarcheologist said: ‘The first injury was probably a cut to the right side of the ear and upper jaw. ‘This was then followed by a series of sword cuts, all delivered from the left hand side behind the victim, in a downward and horizontal motion.’ Bone analysis also revealed that the man ate a diet rich in marine fish. He had some spinal abnormalities, suffered from sinus infections, and had lost a few teeth. He also had two small tumours on his skull and had sustained another head injury up to two years before he was killed. The skull forms part of a skeleton that was first dug up in 1994 during excavations in Lewes, East Sussex - around 20 miles from the famous battlefield. Bones were originally sent to experts at the University of York as part of preparations to celebrate the 750th anniversary of the Battle of Lewes. But radiocarbon testing of the remains at the University of Edinburgh dated them to 28 years either side of 1063.

No bones have previously been discovered of anyone who fought and died during the historic event, so the remains of the 45-year-old (pictured) thought to have died in battle, are a first . This skeleton was found on the site of a former medieval hospital. Tim Sutherland, a battlefield expert from the University of York, said: ‘The skeleton is apparently unique in that it appears to be the only individual ever recorded which could be related to the Norman invasion. A remarkable new story could be unfolding.’ Edwina Livesey from the Sussex Archaeological Society described the find as ‘shocking’. ‘When I heard the news I was completely gobsmacked. It begins to paint a picture of what might have happened in the aftermath. ‘They haven’t found any grave pits of the Normans. The ground is very acidic so the bones may not have survived.’ The Norman conquest of England encompasses the 11th-century invasion and occupation of England by an army of Norman, Breton, and French soldiers led by Duke William II of Normandy, later William the Conqueror. William's claim to the English throne originated from his relation to the childless Anglo-Saxon King Edward the Confessor. Edward died in January 1066 and was succeeded by his brother-in-law Harold Godwinson. William was known for his skill as as a military leader. His troops, with both infantry and cavalry, were feared and respected. He had fought and defeated the king of France in 1054 and 1057. The Norwegian king Harald Hardrada invaded northern England in September 1066, was victorious at the Battle of Fulford, but Harold defeated and killed him at the Battle of Stamford Bridge on 25 September 1066. Soon after, William landed in southern England. Harold marched south to confront him, leaving a large portion of his army in the north. Harold's army confronted William's invaders on 14 October at the Battle of Hastings; William's force defeated Harold, who was killed. In 1066, Battle was an important area. Even in the Domesday Book, the region of Sussex was valued at £48 before the battle and £30 in 1066 itself. The skull forms part of a skeleton that was first dug up in 1994 during excavations in Lewes, East Sussex - around 20 miles from the famous battlefield. An image showing the imagined violence of the battle is pictured . Ms Holst said that from bone analysis they could tell that the man ate a diet rich in marine fish and was at least 45 years old. ‘He had some spinal abnormalities and suffered from chronic infection of the sinuses. ‘He showed age-related wear and tear of the joints of his spine, shoulders and left wrist, which might have been uncomfortable. ‘He had lost a few teeth during life, possibly as a result of receding gums. He had two small tumours on his skull.’ Although he was violently killed, the man had sustained some other kind of head injury up to two years before his death. The skeleton, which bears the marks of battle, was found in Lewes, around 20 miles from the famous battlefield, thought to be located in Battle, East Sussex . Tim Sutherland, a battlefield expert from the University of York, said: 'The skeleton is apparently unique in that it appears to be the only individual ever recorded which could be related to the Norman invasion. A remarkable new story could be unfolding.' Sword marks are easily visible on the skull (pictured) The Norman invaders were thought to have buried their dead in a mass grave, but there were records of the bones of English fighters being visible on the hillsides years later. The Norman Conquest and the Battle of Hastings is immortalised in the Bayeux tapestry, section of which is pictured . She said: ‘He had sustained an injury to the left temple which caused a blood clot to form. It was well-healed at the time of his death.’ English Heritage said: ‘This is a fascinating discovery and a potentially very interesting piece of evidence from the second half of the 11th century. It certainly demonstrates the violence of the period. ‘It would be a reasonable hypothesis that this individual could have some links to the Norman Conquest, but further research is essential in understanding the potential significance of this skeleton.’ A new battle: In late 2013, experts claimed that King Harold died with an arrow in his eye not at the site of Battle Abbey (which has a dedicated vistor's centre - but on a spot that is now a roundabout on the A2100 . In late 2013, experts claimed that King Harold died with an arrow in his eye not at the site of Battle Abbey (which has a dedicated vistor's centre - but on a spot that is now a roundabout on the A2100. Archaeologists from Channel 4's Time team excavated grounds around the Abbey and the other site proposed by historian John Grehan. They found no evidence that either place was where the army of William the Conqueror triumphed over the forces of Harold, the English King. Using aerial laser imaging, Time Team then mapped the terrain - on the basis of which a group of experts agreed that the most likely location for the battle was a roundabout joining Upper and Lower Lake in the town of Battle. Time Team said the mapping had ‘proved’ that the traditional battlefield - on the land directly below the Abbey - would have been too boggy for William’s cavalry. ‘Military analysts studied the data to see where Harold, a skilled commander, would most probably have mounted his defence,’ explained a Channel 4 spokesman. ‘They identified the only ideal battlefield. It seems Harold’s fearsome Saxon shield wall straddled a narrow strategic pass that is on today’s A2100.’","Remains were found Lewes, East Sussex - around 20 miles from the famous battlefield - on the site of a medieval hospital .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Amazingly well-preserved cave paintings dating back seven millenia have been discovered in Spain. The stunning murals provide a rare glimpse into daily prehistoric life - showing dramatic hunting scenes including human archers. Despite being exposed to harsh weather, the 'totally unique' artwork has survived on a 19ft (6 metre) long wall inside a small cave in Vilafranca in Castellón, in the east of the country. Cave paintings dating from 7,000 years ago have been discovered in Spain, which show hunting scenes including human archers and primitive bulls (pictured) called aurochs . The exact location of the cave is being kept a secret until the paintings can be properly protected and preserved, The Art Newspaper reported. Archaeologists discovered the ancient paintings, which include drawings of two aurochs - ancestors of modern cattle - two human archers and a goat. A layer of . dust protected 12 figures, which were exposed to the weather, but . luckily the pigmentation of the paintings has not suffered as a result. Computer analysis has made it possible to identify aspects of the paintings that had not been easily visible behind the dust. Computer analysis has made it possible to identify aspects of the paintings, which had not been easily visible behind the dust. This image is enhanced using digital technology.  Experts think that the figures (pictured) evoke hunting scenes and moments prior to the chase . A layer of dust protected 10 figures, which were exposed to the weather, but thankfully the pigmentation of the paintings has not suffered as a result. This image shows one of the archers beneath the dust . The newly discovered paintings in the cave appear to show a human using a bow and arrow. The primitive weapon is known to have been invented by the end of the Upper Palaeolithic. Bows eventually replaced spear-throwers as the predominant way of catching food. The oldest evidence of archery in Europe was found in a valley in Hamburg, Germany and is up to 13,000 years old. Arrows were made of pine and had flint points. The oldest definite bows were found in Holmegård swamp in Denmark in the 1940s and have been dated to 8,000 BC. Experts believe the figures evoke hunting scenes and the moments prior to the chase. Researchers from the University of Barcelona, the University of Toulouse II Le Mirail and the University of Valencia came across the site while they were examining another area in the region. Inés Domingo Sanz, a research professor at the University of Barcelona said: ‘Some of the [painting] details are unique [and unlike anything] across the entire Mediterranean Basin’. 'Hunting scenes are common in Levantine rock art...they are mostly focused on deer, goat or wild board hunting, but bull hunting is far less common,' she told MailOnline. 'When depicted, they usually [show] linear archers - very schematic figures - later in the sequence. However, in this new site, the archer they are related with is also naturalistic.' Dr Domingo Sanze explained that Levantine rock art - the group of over 700 sites of prehistoric rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin - was included in the World Heritage list by Unesco in 1998, so the historic, cultural and artistic value of this rock art tradition has already a universal recognition. 'Isolated bulls are more common in Levantine art, while in this scene we have at least 4 bulls sharing the scene,' she said. 'There are other examples, such as the Prado del Navazo or La Vacada in Teruel, but considering that there are more than 700 sites with Levantine art known so far, this scene can be considered unique.' Dr Domingo Sanz explained that the action and some of the features of the archer has not been seen before, as well as one of the animals painted, but that the findings will be revealed in a forthcoming research paper. The condition of the paintings is also excellent. 'Although new discoveries have taken place in the last few years, they usually include a very few and damaged motifs. But in this site we have a minimum of 12 quite well preserved motifs , including several animal species and most of them are quite large - the average size of the bulls is 30cm, and the humans 16 cm.' The uncovered site means that links could be established between the paintings in the area of Valltorta-Gasulla in Castellon with those situated in Bajo Aragón, as Vilafranca lies between them. 'This finding fills a gap and help us to start reconstructing potential communication routes between these two main rock art regions. These links are also supported by the stylistic similarities of some of the motifs at these new site with other motifs recorded in these two major regions,' she said. The Valltorta-Gasulla caves are filled with images of archers and large animals, such as an enormous primitive bull, and are considered to be some of the most important examples of open air cave paintings in the world. Some caves show examples of agriculture and hunting scenes, such as a single male attacking a group of deer with a bow and arrow, hinting at a technique used by the primitive inhabitants of the caves. Experts discovered the paintings on a 19ft (6metre) long wall in a small cave in Vilafranca (marked) in Castellón, in the east of Spain.

The . 73-year-old, from Skipton, North Yorkshire, pleaded guilty to dangerous . driving at Skipton Magistrates Court over March 4 incident. As well as the year-long ban, he was fined £1,080 and ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £108 and costs of £85. He must also take an extended driving test before he is allowed his licence back. This isn't right! Rigby turns the pages of his road map as he tries to work out which way to go next . Maybe if you turn it upside down... Rigby continues to stare at the map, oblivious to the police filming him . Dave Brown, Safety Camera Team Manager for North Yorkshire police, said Rigby should consider himself lucky. 'Mr Rigby captured the attention of the safety camera operator when he began to wander across the dotted white line of the overtaking lane as he read the map,' said Mr Brown. 'The footage captured by the safety camera shows the driver is distracted for a least 10 seconds while flicking through his atlas and then holding it up to his face, completely obscuring his view of the road. 'Those 10 seconds could have been disastrous for him or other road users - he should consider himself fortunate that he was in a position to attend court and escape with just a driving ban and hefty fine. 'This case demonstrates the clear evidence captured by the safety camera and should serve as a reminder to other road users of the potential consequences if they choose to take dangerous and unnecessary risks.'","Peter Rigby was spotted driving erratically along the A59 in North Yorkshire .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . UNESCO has warned that plans for a wind farm of Dorset's Jurassic Coast could compromise its status as a World Heritage Site. The organisation has waded into the row over a controversial wind farm, writing an explosive letter to Whitehall outlining serious concerns about the project. UNESCO also stressed that Britain could be in breach of the World Heritage Convention, which dictates that individual countries have a duty to ensure the 'identification, protection, conservation and presentation' of their World Heritage Site. Controversy: The Jurassic Coast is famed for its lack of man-made buildings, keeping it as a natural attraction . The director of UNESCO ends the letter by urging the relevant authorities to take the comments into account when deciding to grant the wind farm permission. While it wasn't outlined in the letter, some experts claim that if the wind farm goes ahead, the Jurassic Coast could be placed on UNESCO's endangered list, meaning its status is in serious jeopardy. The letter has been sent to the Department for Culture Media and Sport, which is responsible for managing England's only natural World Heritage Site. Earlier this year the department wrote to UNESCO, claiming the government-backed wind farm, called Navitus Bay, won't impact on the Jurassic Coast. The body then commissioned its own advisory body, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), to look further into the matter and the letter is the result of the report. Proposal: The plan is to build 194 wind turbines at sea, which would affect the view from the coast . In his strongly-worded letter, Kishore Rao, the director of UNESCO, wrote: 'IUCN considers the project will have a significant impact on the natural setting of the property, in that it would adversely impact on important views. 'The project would replace the Isle of Wight as the dominant feature on the horizon. 'This is likely to significantly impact on visitors' experience and appreciation of the property which could compromise the long term sustainability of the management of the property through loss of revenue. 'Any potential impacts on this natural property are in contradiction to the overarching principal of the World Heritage Convention as the completion of the project would result in the property being presented to future generations in a form significantly different from what was there at the time of inscription until today. 'The property will change from being located in a natural setting largely free from human-made structures to one where its setting is dominated by human-made structures.' Warning: Experts claim that building the wind farm could put Dorset's Jurassic Coast on UNESCO's endangered list . Navitus Bay would cover an area of 59 square miles, consist of 194, 600ft tall turbines and be positioned 8.8 miles off Durlston Head, near Swanage, Dorset, from where it will cover 45 per cent of the horizon. The turbines will generate enough energy to power 710,000 homes. Enco Wind UK and the French company EDF Energy Renewables are behind Navitus Bay and they have recently submitted an application to the Planning Inspectorate. Local tourism chiefs have predicted a 14 per cent drop in tourism, equating to one billion pounds, as a result of the presence of the wind farm. At a recent public meeting held to discuss the proposed development there was overwhelming opposition to it. Fears: Locals have been campaigning against the wind farm and tourism chiefs have predicted a 14 per cent drop in visitors if it goes ahead . Dr Andrew Langley, of campaign group Challenge Navitus, has welcomed UNESCO's intervention. He said: 'We think this letter is a very significant step in the whole process. 'We have been stating the impact Navitus Bay will have on the Jurassic Coast for over two years now and this letter confirms that our concerns are real. 'The government will be under pressure to respond accordingly.' Malcolm Turnbull was the lead officer for Dorset County Council for the World Heritage bid in 2001. He said: 'The IUCN isn't mincing its words on what they believe the impact will be. 'Their report really focuses on the significant impact on the natural setting of the site which is what we have been saying for a long time.'","Proposed wind farm would place 194 turbines off the Jurassic Coast .

"By . John Hall . A television advert for a payday loan company featuring three dancing women dressed in Austrian clothing has been banned for trivialising the practice of borrowing money to buy a car. Two adverts for Loans 2 Go were investigated by the Advertising Standards Authority following a complaint that were 'socially irresponsible' for using light-hearted methods to convince borrowers to take out a payday loan rather than seek less drastic measures to raise money. The regulator found Loans to Go to be in breach of social responsibility laws, saying the 'celebratory atmosphere' the advert created was in contrast to the serious business of taking out a loan. Banned: Loans 2 Go were condemned for 'trivialising' money lending through humorous advertising. One of their adverts featured women dancing in traditional Austrian clothing dancing around an ice cream van . The Advertising Standards Authority said Loans 2 Go breached its code of conduct by taking an overly casual attitude to taking out a loan, adding that although the advert explicitly stated the terms and conditions of borrowing money, it did so against a 'jolly, light-hearted and humorous' backdrop which failed to properly highlight the potential consequences. The first advert shows a man standing in his . driveway with a for sale sign on his car as another man . dressed in lederhosen plays the accordion in front of him. A . voiceover then says: 'Out of cash? Selling your car to make ends meet?', at which point the costumed man begins singing: 'For cash today, use Loans 2 Go, you . still get to keep your car' to the tune of 'For He's a Jolly Good Fellow'. The voiceover adds 'Take out a logbook loan on the car you own' as three women, also dressed in traditional Austrian clothing, start dancing around the car. Serious business: The Advertising Standards Authority said the 'jolly, light-hearted and humorous' were in contrast to the true nature of borrowing money and condemend the 'celebratory atmosphere' Upbeat: One person complained that the adverts were 'socially irresponsible' for trivialising loans. The Advertising Standards Authority said they must not be broadcast again in their current form . A number of short-term loan companies have come in for criticism in recent years, and there been discussions in the House of Commons over the best way to keep them in check. In 2008 money education charity Credit Action complained to the Office of Fair Trading saying lenders breached regulations while targeting potential customers on Facebook. The main complaint was that the APR was not displayed prominently, as is required by UK regulations. In 2010 pressure group Compass organised a campaign to ‘end legal loan sharking’’ which saw over 200 MPs sign an Early Day Motion by April the following year. Payday lender Wonga has faced widespread criticism over interest rates, debt collection methods and its £24 million sponsorship of Newcastle United, which critics say could tempt impressionable young fans into debt. Earlier this year the Advertising Standards Authority criticised Cash Lady for implying payday loans could fund a celebrity lifestyle. The ASA has since been banned the company from using Kerry Katona in advertising, saying she was too heavily associated with debt. The accordion player then hands the . borrower a wad of £20 notes as on-screen text appears, stating: 'Loans . secured on your vehicle. Subject to value of vehicle, proof of income, . status and availability.' It . added that the deal was dependent on the seller providing a logbook, . MOT, insurance details - and that the payback was based on an APR of . 356.3 per cent. In the second advert an ice cream van seller is shown in his van as a voiceover says: 'Out of cash? Your business needs a helping hand?' The lederhosen-clad man and women then reappear, dancing around the ice cream van as the ice cream vendor is handed a wad of cash. One person complained that the two adverts were socially irresponsible by trivialising the nature of taking out a secured loan on your vehicle. The Advertising Standards Authority subsequently banned the adverts, saying they must not be broadcast again in their current form. Describng the reasons for the ban, it stated: 'We noted the jingle used in both ads was catchy and upbeat, that it was likely to be recognised by many viewers as the tune of 'For he's a jolly good fellow', and that during both ads, men and women were seen dressed up in lederhosen dancing, singing and smiling while both drivers were handed a wad of bank notes.' Light-hearted: Throughout the adverts men are handed wads of money as jovial music is played and a voiceover says money can be borrowed against the value of a car . The Authority added: 'We considered . that the overall atmosphere of both ads was jolly, light-hearted and . humorous, in contrast to the serious nature of the business of taking . out a loan.' 'We noted that . the ads explained the men needed a loan to help with a financial . shortfall, portrayed taking out credit as a one-off and stated . explicitly that loans were subject to proof of income, but due to the . celebratory atmosphere of the ads and the lack of emphasis on the . potential consequences of taking out a loan, we felt the ads trivialised . and presented a casual attitude to taking out a loan,' they said. The Advertising Standards Authority said it told Loans 2 Go Ltd to ensure all future advertising complied with the relevant consumer credit legislation and was prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and society.' Bosses at Loans 2 Go Ltd admitted the APR should have been given greater prominence, but insisted it was a cheaper rate than other providers. They agreed that the adverts were 'light-hearted and humorous' but said that was to help consumers familiarise themselves with the Loans 2 Go brand. The added that the ads 'reflected real-life situations that Loans 2 Go said their customers faced, and the ads were pitched in that context' and that they did not 'trivialize the nature of taking out a loan'.","Loans 2 Go 'trivialised' borrowing money through humorous advertising .

"By . Lizzie Parry . A badger gnawing its way out of a shed, a snail munching through carpet and a baby vomiting all over a laptop. They are among the bizarre insurance claims made to provider RIAS, as they reveal the top 10 weirdest reasons for claiming on a policy. In one crazy claim, a snail devoured £78-worth of carpet in the home of a 73-year-old man from Preston in Lancashire. Insurance provider RIAS has published its top 10 list of most bizarre claims in the last year. Among them was a man who claimed after a badger damaged his shed, gnawing its way out after becoming trapped inside . A 71-year-old woman from Bath in Somerset, also received a pay out after locking a badger in her shed, which then ate a hole in the wall to escape. One family received a whopping £8,000 payout after a pigeon flew down their chimney and damaged the carpet, ornaments and sofas. A seven-month-old puppy in Cardiff caused £953 of damage when he pinched a bottle of oil from the kitchen, dragged it to the living room and chewed it while sitting on the couch. In Exeter, Devon, a squirrel smashed a window of an 86-year-old woman after it became stuck in her garage. But animals weren't the only things behind bizarre claims - one 62-year-old received £469 after a gust of wind blew his glasses off his face and were run over by a car. In another settled claim, a man received a new £437 laptop after holding up his baby grandson to show a friend on Skype - who then vomited all over the computer . A proud grandfather in Guildford, Essex, received a new £437 laptop after holding up his baby grandson to show a friend on Skype. The baby then vomited all over the computer. The list of bizarre insurance claims was compiled by specialist insurance provider RIAS from the almost 400,000 successful cases in 2012-13. Peter Corfield, Managing Director at RIAS said: 'While we go out of our way to ensure that our homes and gardens are safe and secure, sometimes it's the most unlikely events that can end up causing real damage. 'Not all claims are straightforward and sometimes we do see some bizarre scenarios. 'But, saying that, babies and animals are often the culprits.' And another involved a snail, who devoured £78-worth of carpet in the home of a 73-year-old man from Preston in Lancashire . 1.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A Florida teenager who spent years living in homeless shelters after his mom died is due to graduate next week as his high school valedictorian. Despite all the upheaval in his life Griffin Furlong remained determined to succeed, and says he stayed strong thanks to his motto of 'never give up' which is written on the rim of his baseball caps. The 18-year-old has managed to achieve a 4.65 grade average at school and is set to study engineering at Florida State University. Determined: Griffin Furlong, pictured second left with his brother Sean, has been named class valedictorian after scoring an impressive 4.65 average despite being homeless . Motivated: Griffin writes his motto, 'Never give up', inside the rim of his baseball caps each season to remind him of what he is trying to achieve . Before he was selected as valedictorian at First Coast High School, few of Griffin's teachers and classmates knew about his hard life. From the age of seven, he and his brother, Sean have been moved to various homeless shelters with their father, and often went hungry. 'I had to grow up really fast. I've seen things that kids wouldn't ever see in their lives,' he told Today, as he explained how the family became homeless after his mother's death when Griffin was six. Living in shelters was difficult for Griffin, who recalled seeing his father being physically abused, and said he often went to bed hungry. 'I don't take anything for granted anymore,' the teenager, who enjoys playing baseball, said. His most recent upheaval came just before his final exams, when Griffin found himself back in a shelter. Loss: When he was just six years old, Griffin's mother died from leukemia . Focused: From a young age Griffin realized the only way he could change his life was to work hard at school . Fortunately, the family of his girlfriend were able to take him in for a few weeks until relatives could find space for him, and the teenager still managed to score highly in his tests. 'I know that I have everything to lose, so I just push myself,' he said, adding that school and family are all that he has. His unconventional upbringing sometimes left Griffin feeling cut off from his peers. Because he was living in homeless shelters he couldn't have friends over, and had to take a different bus to school. 'A lot of kids made fun of me, but I didn't let . that interfere with what I did in school. I had a plan - just make good . grades, and don't worry about anyone else but my family,' he said. The youngster quickly realized that the only chance he had to improve his life was to study hard, and despite his difficult home life, Griffin has never missed a day of school. 'I knew I was going to be poor for the . rest of my life, so I thought if I could continue to do well in school, . eventually scholarships would be coming my way and I would be getting a . free education,' he said. Support: When Griffin became homeless again just before his final exams the family of his girlfriend, Avery, let him stay at their house . He added that he and his brother, who is due to graduate from Florida State University this summer, were also motivated to succeed in honor of their mother. Ambitious: Griffin has never missed a day of school and is getting ready to start university . The brothers formed a close bond, often having only each other to confide in. 'I couldn't tell my friends what I was going through,' Sean, 21, said. 'It was mainly just me . and Griffin, and we did everything together, baseball especially.. 'He's just a really tough individual. He's younger than me, but I still . look up to him,' he added. After achieving a high grade average, Griffin has received scholarships to help pay for his university housing, and is now trying to get an academic scholarship to help with tuition. A Go Fund Me page set up to help pay for his college education has raised more than $27,000 in just six days. When he applied to university, one of his teachers wrote a letter of recommendation, praising not only his academic abilities but also his determination to succeed. 'I said he was the hardest working, most-motivated student I have ever had,' teacher Jennifer Stover, told WPTV. 'He . never missed a day of school, was always at baseball practice and . managed to get his homework done every night and always do well,' another said, . Next step: After graduating high school Griffin, pictured with Avery, plans to study engineering at Florida State University . Griffin said that as details of his upbringing became more widely known it helped ease the burden he has been carrying. He is due to give a speech at his high school graduation on June 4, and will share his message of determination. 'Just never give up. Never let anyone tell you that you can't do something, because I've been told that all my life ... now I'm here at the top of my class.'","Griffin Furlong graduates from high school with 4.65 average .

"By . Sean Poulter . Support: MP Stella Creasy has been one of the most vociferous critics of payday loans . MPs and experts have hit out at a promised crackdown on payday loan firms after it failed to cap extortionate interest rates. The new government watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, yesterday announced controls to tackle irresponsible lending and bully boy tactics. They will include mandatory ‘affordability checks’ and limits on how many times the lenders can raid the bank accounts of defaulting customers. But critics said the FCA should have announced a cap on interest rates, which can top 5,800 per cent, or even an outright ban on the industry. One MP who has campaigned vociferously on the issue, Stella Creasy, warned that concerns over payday loans could turn into a scandal to match the mis-selling of payment protection insurance unless more urgent action is taken. There were hopes that the new FCA, which takes over regulation for consumer credit from the Office for Fair Trading in April next year, would have used its stronger powers to impose tougher controls on loan sharks. Payday lenders have flourished on the back of a cost of living crisis by offering expensive short-term loans to millions. The industry has grown from virtually nothing five years ago to lending more than £2billion a year, despite the extortionate interest rates involved. New rules: The controls will include mandatory 'affordability checks' and limit the number of times lenders can raid defaulting customers' accounts . Top lender: Caps would have applied to the likes of market leader Wonga.com which has faced fierce criticism in the past . The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has condemned the damaging impact of companies such as market leader Wonga.com. A study published by the Government yesterday revealed that the lenders have failed to abide by promises to treat customers fairly. One in five borrowers reported that when they took out an initial loan their lender did not ask about their finances to make sure they could afford repayments. Nearly one in four came under pressure to extend their loan, which can dramatically increase the cost, while half said lenders did not explain the risks. Borrowers are required to fill out a Continuous Payment Authority form, which allows the lender to effectively raid their account to grab repayments. Nearly one in three customers reported that the CPA system was not clearly explained, while 60 per cent were not told how to cancel CPA. The new regime, which does not come into effect until after April next year, will make affordability checks on borrowers mandatory and limit the number of loan roll-overs to two. It will also restrict the number of times lenders can use the CPA system to tap into a customer’s account to two. Miss Creasy said the new rules should have included a cap on interest rates. Caps have been imposed in Australia, Japan, and several European countries, while most states in the US have effectively banned payday lenders. Miss Creasy said: ‘The reason people get into problems is because of the cost of this credit and what that does to people who are already struggling. ‘The evidence from other countries is that capping works. We see lower levels of personal debt and lower levels of illegal lending. ‘People are lying awake at night panicking about how they pay the escalating cost of these debts.’ She . likened the scale of the problem to the mis-selling of PPI by the big . banks, when billions of pounds worth of useless insurance policies were . sold. Outspoken: Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has condemned the damaging power of payday loan firms . ‘If we don’t act now to change this, this is going to be the next PPI scandal – I am convinced of it,’ she said. Andre Spicer, professor of organisational behaviour at Cass Business School, said: ‘The regulations do not address the  usurious rates of interest charged. Nor do they ask whether the industry should exist at all.’ However, the chief of the new FCA, Martin Wheatley, insisted the firms do provide a useful service. ‘Many people make use of these loans and pay off their debt without a hitch, so we don’t want to stop that happening,’ he said. But, he warned: ‘This type of credit must only be offered to those that can afford it.’ The Consumer Finance Association, which represents the interests of payday loan businesses, said a cap on interest would lead to more illegal lending.","The Financial Conduct Authority announced restrictions on irresponsible lending .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . Porn performers in California must wear condoms during film shoots and their employers must provide regular testing under a bill that passed the state Assembly on Tuesday. The bill, AB1576 by Assemblyman Isadore Hall, D-Compton, advanced to the Senate on a 41-12 vote, the minimum number of votes needed. The bill follows a similar mandate in Los Angeles County, approved by voters in 2012. Hall said his bill is a workplace-safety measure to curb the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, citing recent industry-imposed moratoriums on adult film shoots after actors were diagnosed. Assemblyman Isadore Hall, right, had his measure requiring adult film actors to wear condoms during filming and be tested regularly, passed on Tuesday . 'Whether you work in agriculture, manufacturing, health care, food service or any other industry, all workers deserve a safe workplace to make a living,' said Hall, who tried and failed twice before to pass such legislation. The bill has provoked contentious committee hearings, with adult-film representatives saying it would persuade their industry to flee California. The Valley Industry and Commerce Association says the adult film industry is worth $6 billion in the San Fernando Valley. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation, a sponsor of the bill, says it would pursue film producers who leave California, with a much-debated argument that porn shoots are technically illegal in most states. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation, a sponsor of the bill, says it would pursue film producers who leave California, with a much-debated argument that porn shoots are technically illegal in most states . Last fall, the group filed a complaint about an adult film made in Florida, where California porn makers outsourced unprotected sex scenes. High-profile film stars also opposed the bill, saying its provisions would undermine their medical privacy and that existing testing protocols provided enough protection. 'Condoms are made for home environments, normal sex and normal time frames,' actress Kayden Kross said in an April hearing. Other porn actors who have contracted HIV have supported the bill, saying their employers put their health second to profits. Last year porn actors Rod Daily and his girlfriend Cameron Bay revealed they both had HIV and condemned the industry for putting profit before the health of performers . Safety regulators with the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health say existing blood-borne pathogen rules already require condom use but are rarely enforced. Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, R-Twin Peaks, doubted if AB1576 would be any more effective. 'This is largely unenforceable, even though I know there's a line of people wanting to inspect sets,' he said.","Porn performers in California must wear .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . In ‘X-Men: Days of Future Past’, super-villain Magneto is shown ripping a baseball stadium from its foundation and levitating it off the ground. Inspired by this incredible power, a plumber from Lincolnshire has attempted to recreate this metal-controlling power using home-made magnetic shoes. Colin Furze, 34, spent a week creating the strange gadget, which allow him to walk upside down along metal ceilings. Scroll down for videos . Mr Furze built the magnet in the shoes . using a microwave transformer, with one of the coils removed, and . hooking it up to a car battery. He then placed the transformer on a shoe shaped plate and clamped his foot to it. He has attached straps to the shoes with switches which power the flow of electricity and enable him to walk. The father-of-one said he could potentially use his mad invention to scale skyscrapers, instead of taking the lift. ‘The shoes are great fun but it is rather bizarre trying to walk upside down, you have to really force your feet on to the ceiling,’ said Mr Furze, who lives in Stamford, Lincolnshire. ‘It’s rather nerve-racking because if the electricity fails the magnets won’t work and I will fall. An X-Men fan has invented his own magnetic shoes which help him to walk upside down. Colin Furze, 34, spent a week creating the amazing shoes after being inspired by comic book character Magneto, who can move metal with his mind . Mr Furze built the magnet in the shoes using a microwave transformer, with one of the coils removed, and hooking it up to a car battery. He then placed the transformer on a shoe shaped plate and clamped his foot to it . ‘I think the shoes could be useful for beating the queues at a railway station by walking over the top of everyone’s heads or running along the side of buildings in busy shopping streets.’ Mr Furze built the magnet in the shoes using a microwave transformer, with one of the coils removed, and hooking it up to a car battery.

The plumber recently invented a pair of Wolverine-inspired claws complete with 12 inch (30cm) stainless steel blades. Not only do they automatically extend and retract, like Hugh Jackman’s claws in X-Men, they are so sharp they have been used to slice watermelon and rip card from a distance. Mr Furze has also previously built a turbojet engine, vacuum shoes and hacked a mobility scooter.

"By . Simon Parry . Created: . 15:00 EST, 7 December 2013 . Crucial aid sent from Britain and other countries to help the victims of typhoon-ravaged areas of the Philippines is being stockpiled by officials, witnesses claim. US military food packets have reportedly turned up on the shelves of shops in affluent districts of the capital Manila – hundreds of miles from the disaster zone. And shelter equipment purchased using British donations has been locked up in government warehouses and stockpiled alongside rice and other food intended for victims of last month’s catastrophe, The Mail on Sunday has been told. A television news report shows much-needed supplies on sale in affluent parts of the capital Manila . Filipinos rush to get relief goods during a helicopter aid drop. Evidence that much-needed supplies are being stockpiled rather than being distributed to those in need . Last night, the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) – an umbrella group representing 14 UK charities – expressed concern about evidence that suggests not all the £60 million of aid given by Britain is reaching those most in need. Alarming evidence of the thefts has been provided by expat Keb Darge, 56, who says he faces death threats for stopping local officials stealing aid in Eastern Samar, one of the worst-hit areas. Mr Darge, a disc jockey originally from Scotland, said: ‘The aid isn’t getting through to where it’s needed. I’ve seen the deliveries arrive and I’ve seen them disappear. ‘Only a tiny percentage of the aid is getting through. The situation isn’t going to improve unless there’s an investigation. Someone needs to go and find out exactly what is happening. It is British aid coming in. Why give it to untrustworthy officials to steal? It is ludicrous.’ Mr Darge photographed supplies being locked up rather than distributed in Eastern Samar, where he used to live with his Filipino wife and their nine-year-old daughter. Now he has gone into hiding in Manila, fearing reprisals after receiving threats from the corrupt officials he has been trying to expose. Charities have expressed concern about evidence that suggests not all the £60¿million of aid given by Britain is reaching those - such as residents of Tacloban (pictured) - that need it most . He said: ‘People have warned me to take these threats seriously. They’ve said, ‘‘Be careful, they will shoot you if you carry on.” I’m under threat. There’s a price on my head.’ Mr Darge’s wife, Edith, 33, lost 15 members of her family when the storm struck their village of Hernani. Since then the couple have offered shelter and fed families in their home, which is solidly built and powered by a generator. Mr Darge has also searched for missing friends and cleared bodies from flooded areas. Television stations in the Philippines have supported Mr Darge’s claims, reporting that supplies have been diverted  to Manila. Aid packages have also apparently been auctioned online. And Mr Darge’s allegations of corruption were backed up by a Japanese aid worker, Shiratori Koti, who said local administrators were diverting goods to their homes. Mr Koti said: ‘There isn’t enough food getting through to people. We don’t have evidence but we believe it is being taken by officials.’ More than 5,000 people were killed and up to four million people displaced when Super Typhoon Haiyan hit on November 8. Pictured: The storm in Legaspi, Albay province . There are also concerns that supplies are simply being wasted. Mr Darge described finding 800 beef-burgers – apparently flown in from the US aircraft carrier George Washington – dumped by the roadside. In Hernani, some residents have criticised the local mayor, Edgar Boco, in the wake of the crisis. One online contributor accused him of withholding aid and ‘distributing it to his preferred party-mafia circle’. In a newspaper interview, Mr Boco admitted his officials were controlling distribution but said: ‘You can’t constantly give relief goods to the people. People will abuse the system. They will gorge themselves.’ A DEC spokesman said last night:  ‘I would be interested to find out what items are being sold and where. ‘There is always a risk of diversion and theft, but our member agencies have measures in place to stop this happening very early on. Our aid is carefully targeted and monitored.’ More than 5,000 people were killed and up to four million people displaced when Super Typhoon Haiyan devastated the Philippines on November 8.","US supplies have turned up on shelves of shops in the capital Manila .

"By . Tamara Cohen . Outburst: Education Secretary Michael Gove (pictured on Tuesday) shouted 'you're a disgrace' at those MPs who opposed the Government in the vote . Michael Gove was so furious with Tory MPs for voting down intervention he had to be restrained by colleagues, it was claimed last night. The Education Secretary, a staunch backer of military action in Syria, shouted 'you're a disgrace' at those MPs who opposed the Government in the tense vote last night. Scottish National MP Angus Robertson said Mr Gove carried on yelling 'disgrace, disgrace, disgrace' at Tory and Liberal Democrat rebels in stunning scenes in the House of Commons around 11pm last night. Labour MP Barry Gardiner also told how Mr Gove, a close ally of Prime Minister David Cameron, 'lost it' and accused colleagues of 'supporting (Syrian President Bashar al-) Assad'. He had to be persuaded to calm down by colleagues. Mr Gove, speaking about Syria this week, did not join colleagues in calling for MPs to vote on military action, saying he believed the appropriate response should be decided by the Prime Minister. He said at a speech in London on Tuesday that any action should be predicated 'above all' on the 'horrendous humanitarian atrocities' thought to have been carried out by regime forces. 'I am like everyone, horrified by what we've seen in Syria and like almost everyone anxious that whatever can be done to alleviate the suffering is done', he said. Dramatic: Mr Gove's outburst came after David Cameron (left) and Labour leader Ed Miliband (right) had spoken . 'I think we're lucky that we have in David Cameron and William Hague the right people leading this country and its response to the terrible things that have happened in Syria.... ‘We all need to be calm but resolute in our response, and I think that's exactly the position and the virtues the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary have shown. 'The decision about the government is going to respond to the horrendous humanitarian atrocities that we have witnessed is one that is properly taken by the Prime Minister and the members of the National Security Council.'","Education Secretary Gove was staunch backer of military action in Syria .

Sweating through 28-hour shifts in the malarial jungle of the lowlands of south-east Peru, prospectors brave the perils of collapsing earth and limb-crushing machinery to gather a few grams of gold.

To ward off fatigue and avoid fatal accidents they chew coca, a mild herbal stimulant endemic to the region that is the basis of the drug cocaine. Scroll down for video .

A motortaxi delivers a cargo of mattresses to a mining camp in La Pampa, where an estimated 20,000 wildcat miners toil in a malarial expanse of denuded rainforest . Authorities are acting on international pressure to head off an incipient environmental catastrophe in the region. The Amazon Conservation Association, an NGO, says the destructive mining methods raze trees, devastate habitats, contaminate waterways and endanger public health. In Madre de Dios alone an estimated 30 to 40 tons of mercury are dumped into the environment annually, ACA claims. The liquid metal, a potent neurotoxin, is used to amalgamate gold particles and then burned off – generally without even rudimentary technology to protect workers’ health or capture waste or fumes. It also bleeds into the surrounding ecosystem. Mercury bioaccumulates throughout the food chain to become concentrated in top predators, such as large river fish and carnivorous birds. The advance of the miners into the virgin forest has also led to conflict over land use rights, with many communities illegally invaded by prospectors looking for the next rich seam. Last October, researchers using airborne mapping and satellite monitoring estimated that the area affected by illegal mining had increased 400 per cent between 1999 and 2012.

The 51-year-old, a native of the Andes city of Cuzco, has been fixing motors in La Pampa ever since artisanal gold miners began carving out lawless, ramshackle settlements from Amazon jungle there in 2008. It's not just miners who are threatened with economic catastrophe from the government's campaign to wipe out illegal mining operations, said a mining camp cook, who identified herself only as Gladis, fearing government retribution.

"By . Associated Press . President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama reported assets worth between $1.8 million and $7 million for last year, little changed from their previous year's holdings, according to financial disclosure forms released Thursday.

The forms show the largest jointly owned assets by the president and the first lady were Treasury notes worth between $1 million and $5 million.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Sued: Former Olympic swimming coach Mark Schubert . A swimming coach and philanthropist claimed that she was wrongfully fired by former U.S. national coach Mark Schubert after she became aware of abuse allegations within his club. It was another embarrassing turn for the sport that has taken steps over the last two years to combat widespread claims of sexual misconduct. The lawsuit, filed on Monday in Orange County Superior Court, claims Dia Rianda was brought in by Schubert to work at Golden West Swim Club last year while he was dealing with personal issues. It says she became aware of sexual abuse allegations against his close friend, Bill Jewell, and strongly objected to him working at the club in southern California. The suit alleges Rianda was fired on . July 11 after she tried to keep children from being around Jewell while . he was being investigated by USA Swimming. 'The reaction from Mark was very confusing,' she said. 'On the one hand, he was concerned that the behavior was not acceptable. 'On the other hand, he justified it by saying that's the way things have been at USA Swimming for a long time.' Schubert didn't immediately respond to a text message and a voice mail seeking comment. USA Swimming said it doesn't comment 'on open investigations'. 'As a matter of process, when USA Swimming initiates a coach investigation, it immediately notifies the employing club,' the organization said in a statement. 'As per the Amateur Sports Act, membership status is not affected without the opportunity for a due process hearing. Employment decisions during investigations are the responsibility of the employing club.' The lawsuit doesn't publicly name a . dollar-amount Rianda is seeking, but she stressed the main purpose of . the lawsuit is to change the culture of the sport. She . and her husband, Mike, have donated 'well over $100,000' to the USA . Swimming Foundation, along with more than $400,000 to purchase a pool . for Carmel High School in California. 'There . are rules to follow. They are there for a good reason,' Rianda said. 'The rules are not that complicated and it shouldn't be that difficult . to follow them. If someone is complaining about a problem, the problem . should stop immediately.' Concerns: Golden West Swim Club in southern California where a coach was being investigated by USA Swimming . While she made a complaint to USA Swimming, she didn't report her concerns about Jewell to law enforcement. 'The behavior that I had observed was on the line as to whether it was criminal or not,' she said. 'That's why I never went to the authorities.' Her attorney, Robert Allard, has filed several prominent suits against USA Swimming, exposing dozens of coaches who were involved in inappropriate relationships with underage swimmers. The cases led to the national governing body grudgingly revealing in 2010 that 46 members had received lifetime bans, mostly for sex abuse allegations – including the former director of the national team. USA Swimming has since mandated training and set up an enhanced screening system for all coaches, officials and volunteers. At its national convention in Greensboro, North Carolina last week, the organization revealed it has trained more than 31,000 non-athlete members, conducted background checks on nearly 36,000 and added 16 people to its banned list since the new program went into effect. Even though USA Swimming is not named in this lawsuit, Allard repeated his oft-stated call for a change in leadership. 'We see some change is being made by some good people. I don't think anybody denies that. This is predominantly a sport comprised of good people,' he said. 'But at the very top of the organization, there is rampant corruption.' The lawsuit claims Rianda received complaints about Jewell from both parents and swimmers, passing on the information to Chuck Wielgus, the executive director of USA Swimming, and Susan Woessner, the organization's director of safe sport. The investigation began in January. Schubert is a member of the International Swimming Hall of Fame and took over as U.S. national coach after the 2004 Athens Olympics. He guided the team through the Beijing Games, where Michael Phelps set an Olympic record with eight gold medals but was mysteriously fired by USA Swimming two years ago. No reason has been given for his dismissal, though Rianda said she was told by Schubert that he was let go because he knew of a two-decades-old abuse case and wanted to go public. Now, he's accused of turning his back on a case closer to home. 'He just did not seem to have a concept of what the new rules were, what the new policies were,' Rianda said. 'He would make excuses for (Jewell) and say he's innocent until proven guilty.' After his dismissal by USA Swimming, Schubert returned to the deck at Golden West, rekindling his partnership with former Olympic champion Janet Evans, perhaps his most famous athlete. At age 40, she attempted a comeback after 16 years away from competitive swimming but didn't come close to making the team for London during the U.S. trials this summer. The suit also touches on a sordid affair allegedly involving Jewell and Schubert. It claims that Schubert hired a private investigator to take photos of another prominent coach, Sean Hutchison, engaged in improper sexual activities while working with the FAST program in Fullerton, California. Vasquez claims Schubert received a $625,000 payment from USA Swimming to keep from going public with the information. Jewell was in charge of the FAST program at the time and revealed to the AP in December 2010 that he had received complaints against Hutchison, though he stressed that no wrongdoing was found. Hutchison denied he was involved with one of his swimmers, but he left the club and was not known to have worked with any prominent athletes leading up to the London Games – a stunning downfall for a coach who had been a rising star of the profession. Rianda said she still loves the sport and hopes that her lawsuit will lead to significant changes. 'It's easy to let things sit forever until the statute of limitations runs out, or until somebody gives up. Then the problem goes away,' she said.

"By . Eve Mcgowan . Grand hall: Amarhit and Gurdip, pictured outside Friar's Lawn in Southall, West London with their daughter Aunett and husky Rex, are downsizing . Among the 1930s semis of Southall in West London, the Georgian mansion Friars Lawn couldn’t be more incongruous. With its gated entrance, wisteria-clad frontage and elegant proportions, the four-storey house is wholly at odds with the suburban streets that surround it. It has a history which marks it out from the crowd, too. In the 1930s the six-bedroom house was owned by Gordon Selfridge Junior, whose father founded the Oxford Street department store. It was later bought by the actress Hayley Mills, daughter of actor Sir John Mills. Hayley – who starred in hit films . Pollyanna and The Parent Trap in the Sixties, and more recently appeared . in ITV’s Wild At Heart – lived in the property with the actor Leigh . Lawson for seven years in the 1970s. Now . the stunning house, which overlooks the trees and grass of Norwood . Green, is being sold by dentist Amarjit Khambay after a painstaking . four-year renovation which has set him back £750,000. When . Amarjit bought the Grade-II-listed house for three-quarters of a . million pounds in 2002, he had no idea about the extent of the work . required. What started off as a supposedly straightforward job of damp proofing the basement snowballed into something much larger. ‘The builders discovered that all the timbers were infected with woodworm and the entire internal structure of the house had to be replaced,’ says Amarjit, 58. ‘The roof had to be stripped back and completely retiled.’ Then began the painstaking restoration . of all the original features inside. All the old windows were taken . out, treated and refitted. The original shutters were restored, . cornicing was repaired and ceilings and walls were replastered using the . same process and horsehair plaster as in the late 18th Century when the . house was built. The . Khambays even employed a ‘heritage gardener’ who dug out the old . Ordnance Survey maps to design and replant the walled garden exactly as . it once was. Home sweet home: The sitting room in the £1.9million six-bedroom home in West London . Extreme home makeover: The Khambays built an extension with a master suite and turned part of the basement into a gym, sauna, bar and spa pool . The house had . been on the market for three years when Amarjit and his 53-year-old wife . Gurdip, also a dentist, bought it from a retired Army officer and his . wife. Now for sale again, . the £1.9 million price tag attached to Friars Lawn also sets it apart . from its neighbours. The three- and four-bed 1930s semis that surround . it start at around £350,000. ‘If . this house was on one of the smarter roads in Chiswick it would be on . at £6 million at least,’ says estate agent Mark Poole, from Felicity J. Lord. According to Mark, prices in the area around the house have risen . by ten per cent in the last year. ‘There is strong demand for property . at the moment – the biggest problem is not enough stock.’ Amarjit . and Gurdip built a two-storey extension on the side of the house to . create a kitchen/diner and master bedroom suite above. They turned part . of the basement into a gym, sauna, bar and spa pool. Former resident: 1960s actress Hayley Mills . Because . of the building’s listed status they had to work closely with English . Heritage and Ealing Council’s conservation department. Planners . stipulated that they use the same type of brick for the extension as the . main house, in order to make it a seamless addition. Luckily their architect was able to track some down from a salvage yard. ‘I’d . never do it again,’ admits Amarjit, who moved to Britain from Punjab at . the age of 12. The couple lived in the house throughout the upheaval of . the building work, with their three then-teenage children playing . musical bedrooms as each room was rebuilt. However, Friars Lawn isn’t the first . property project for the dentist, who has lived and practised in . Southall for decades and has been property developing alongside his day . job for a number of years. He bought several old Fullers pubs in and . around Chiswick, which he redeveloped into housing and sold on to the . Notting Hill Housing Association. Thankfully, . profit margins weren’t a huge issue when it came to Friars Lawn as, . when he bought, Amarjit had just made an eye-watering profit on the sale . of a sports club nearby. He had bought the complex, complete with 22 acres, for £330,000 and . applied for planning permission to redevelop it, selling it on to a . consortium for more than £2 million without having done anything to it. The couple are selling Friars Lawn to downsize now that their three children, all in their twenties, have flown the nest. ‘I think of myself as an occupier, not an owner,’ says Amarjit, who takes great pride in his restoration of the house. ‘It’s really important to me that the right person buys Friars Lawn. It’s got to be someone who will continue to look after it as we have. ‘To me, it’s a very English house, which is why it appealed,’ he adds. ‘The couple we bought it from had bought it from Hayley Mills, who was moving to Hampton Court. ‘I am a big fan of hers. I like to think she would have enjoyed watching some of her films with her father in the cinema room in the basement.’ fjlord.co.uk, 020 8747 8601 .","West London mansion on the market for £1.9million .

"By . Francesca Chambers . Hillary's hairstyles been such a hot topic over the years the former secretary of state and first lady says she nearly named her memoir in honor of her daring 'dos. In the author's note of her upcoming memoir, Clinton playfully acknowledges the special place her hair holds in American history with a joke that she nearly called her book The Scrunchie Chronicles: 112 Countries And It’s Still All About The Hair. 'In the end, the title that best captured my experiences on the high wire of international diplomacy and my thoughts and feelings about what it will take to secure American leadership for the 21st century was Hard Choices,' Clinton writes. Scroll Down for Video . These days Hillary Clinton wears her hair cropped short . As she was leaving the State Department in January of 2013, Clinton announced she would write a memoir about her experiences working in the Obama administration. The Washington Post pounced on the news and held a reader contest to help Clinton come up with a name for her forthcoming manuscript. Among the winners selected by WaPo were Stephanie Whittaker, director of marketing for a consulting firm in London, who suggested Hillary call her book The Scrunchie Chronicles: 112 Countries and It’s Still All About My Hair. Other noteworthy entries to the contest were: If It’s 3 a.m., The Machine Can Get It, Stuck with Bill, Bossypantsuit, It Takes a World and Hard Times, Soft Power. Still struggling for a title, Clinton lightheartedly told a group of publishers in a speech last March that she actually liked The Scrunchie Chronicles. 'That actually is a keeper. That’s on the shortlist,' Clinton teased. Fashion faux pas: For years, Hillary Clinton's scrunchies have . been the subject of gossip . Please, stop wearing scrunchies: Clinton's insistence on wearing scrunchies long after it was considered fashionably acceptable had State Department staff calling for a ban on scrunchies . Of all her hairstyles, Clinton's '90s era headbands and scrunchies have received the most attention. Clinton's since shed the headbands, but has continued to wear scrunchies long after they were considered cool, leading a State Department official to tell Elle in 2012 that 'some' or her staff were trying to 'ban the scrunchies.' The aide noted that Hillary often wore her hair up because, 'as a chick, it’s a big pain in the butt' to keep your hair looking fresh. 'The weather is different, and you’re in and out of the plane. [The staff] gets off that plane looking like garbage most days, but she has to look camera ready,' the aide said. Clinton said she didn't care what people thought about her appearance when asked about the Elle article in a subsequent interview. 'I feel so relieved to be at the stage I'm at in my life right now... and if others want to worry about it, I let them do the worrying for a change,' she said. 'Because you know, if I want to wear my glasses I'm . wearing my glasses. If I want to wear my hair back I'm pulling my hair . back.' Done caring: In response to staff's attempts to ban her scrunchies, Clinton, pictured here sans scrunchie in 2013, said she was at the point in her life that 'if I want to wear my glasses I'm wearing my glasses. If I want to wear my hair back I'm pulling my hair back.' In the end, Clinton tossed aside The Scrunchie Chronicles and went with another suggestion from WaPo's list for her book title - Hard Choices, which was suggested to the Washington Post by retired New York Times reporter Alfred Friendly Jr. Publishing group Simon & Schuster told Politico that it has already sold 1 . million copies of the memoir, and another 1 million copies will hit shelves when the book drops . on June 10. The memoir will detail President Barack Obama and other . world leaders' difficult decisions as well as Clinton's own during her . time as secretary of state, according to the author's note, released by . the book's publishing group today. 'As is usually the case with the benefit of hindsight, I wish we could go back and revisit certain choices,' Clinton explains at the start of the book. 'But I’m proud of what we accomplished.'","Hillary Clinton's memoir Hard Choices comes out June 10 .

"By . James Tozer . Privacy campaigners have attacked Google after the search giant claimed it was immune to British law. The US company is accused of illegally snooping on its British customers by bypassing privacy settings on Apple devices, such as iPads, to track their browsing history. A group of Britons has taken the firm to court over the claims, but Google is now trying to have the case thrown out. A group of Britons are taking Google to court accusing it of bypassing privacy settings on Apple computers to track their browsing history . It claims it is not subject to British privacy law because it is based in California – prompting outrage from campaigners. The firm has already come under fire for failing to pay tax in the UK, and critics said the latest row was further evidence of Google making up the rules to suit itself. Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch, said: ‘It is deeply worrying for a company with millions of British users to be brazenly saying they do not regard themselves bound by UK law. ‘Regulators need to step up and ensure that when citizens are illegally tracked against their wishes, the companies riding roughshod over their privacy is held to account.’ Solicitor Dan Tench, of law firm Olswang, said: ‘Google has a substantial presence here and earns substantial revenues here. ‘This is yet another instance of Google being here when it suits them and not being here when it doesn’t.’ The internet giant claims it is not subject to British privacy law as its headquarters are in California (pictured) The case centres on Apple’s internet . browser, Safari. It is automatically set up to block ‘cookies’, which . enable internet firms such as Google to track users’ browsing behaviour . and sell the information to advertisers. But Google circumvented the . privacy setting without informing users. The practice was halted after it came to light in the US. Google subsequently had to pay a $22.5million (£14.4million) fine to regulators. More than 100 Apple customers in Britain are now taking legal action against Google, and seeking compensation. But yesterday their lawyers revealed Google is arguing that British courts have ‘no jurisdiction’ over the firm, as its services are based in California. It also argues that information it gleans from people carrying out internet searches cannot be deemed ‘private or confidential’. Among the claimants is retired magazine editor Judith Vidal-Hall, 75, from West London. She claims she began receiving phone calls and emails from companies after using Google searches to buy Christmas presents for her family. In July the Information Commissioner's Office told Google its privacy rules breached UK law . Fellow claimant Marc Bradshaw said action by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK regulator, was pointless because all it could do was fine Google – one of the world’s richest companies. In July the ICO told Google its privacy rules breached UK law. But the maximum fine the ICO can impose is £500,000. ‘It seems to us absurd to suggest that consumers can’t bring a claim against a company which is operating in the UK and is even constructing a $1billion headquarters in London,’ Mr Bradshaw said. ‘If consumers can’t bring a civil claim against a company in a country where it operates, the only way of ensuring it behaves is by having a robust regulator.’ Google’s attempt to throw out the privacy claim will be heard in October. The firm declined to comment last night.","Google accused of illegally snooping on British customers by bypassing privacy settings on Apple devices to track browsing history .

"By . Mark Prigg . It could be the future of warfare and even help fend off pirate attacks. Lockheed Martin today revealed new video of a laser weapon so powerful it can pierce the hull of a boat within seconds. The weapon works over a distance of a mile, and could one day be fitted to ships. Scroll down for video . The Ground-Based Laser System  successfully disabled two boats at a range of approximately a mile - and could soon be used o fend off pirate attacks . An on-board camera reveals flames and smoke just seconds after the laser hits . Designed for short-range defense of high-value areas including forward operating bases, the ADAM system’s 10-kilowatt fiber laser is engineered to destroy targets up to 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) away. It has a tracking range of more than 5 kilometers (3.1 miles). The system has been designed to be flexible enough to operate against rockets as a standalone system and to engage unmanned aerial systems with an external radar cue. The defence giant is developing the transportable, ground-based laser system to demonstrate a practical, affordable defense against short-range threats, including Qassam-like rockets, unmanned aerial systems and small boats. In tests off the California coast, the Lockheed Martin prototype laser system successfully disabled two boats at a range of approximately 1.6 kilometers (approximately 1 mile), the firm confirmed today. These were the first tests of the Area Defense Anti-Munitions (ADAM) system against maritime targets. The defence giant is developing the transportable, ground-based laser system to demonstrate a practical, affordable defense against short-range threats, including Qassam-like rockets, unmanned aerial systems and small boats. 'In less than 30 seconds, the ground-based system’s high-energy laser burned through multiple compartments of the rubber hull of the military-grade small boats operating in the ocean,' the firm confirmed. The system can precisely track moving targets at a range of more than 5 kilometers (3.1 miles), and its 10-kilowatt fiber laser can engage targets up to 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) away. 'Our ADAM . system tests have shown that high-energy lasers are ready to begin . addressing critical defense needs,' said Tory Bruno, president of . Strategic and Missile Defense Systems, Lockheed Martin Space Systems . Company. The laser locks on to the boat, allowing it to begin fiting . The boat quickly catches fire, and begins to sink .

"By . Sean Poulter . Numbers game: The change means a caller dialling a local family member, business or take-away will have to punch in 11-digits . Families in many fast-growing areas will have to dial the full national code to reach local people and businesses in a radical shake-up of the telephone system. Telecoms watchdog Ofcom is making the change in a bid to overcome a predicted shortage of telephone numbers. Families in Bournemouth, Poole and Christchurch will be the first to experience the new system from November this year, adding 01202 to the front of any six-digit local number. Another 44 areas will have to adopt the new regime by 2021. The change means a caller dialling a local family member, business or take-away will have to punch in an 11-digit number. Independent consumer research for the regulator found widespread scepticism that the country is running out of phone numbers. Separately, many people, particularly the elderly, may struggle to get to grips with the new regime. But Ofcom insists the change is the ‘least disruptive’ way to  create thousands of new numbers in areas with a heavy demand. After the Bournemouth area, six places – Aberdeen, Brighton and Hove, Bradford, Middlesbrough, Milton Keynes and Stoke on Trent – will adopt national codes for local numbers by 2016. Nine more areas – Blackpool, Dundee, Northampton, Norwich, Oxford, Plymouth, Southend-on-Sea, Swansea, and Swindon – will change by 2018. A further 29 more will switch to the . new regime by 2021, ranging from Guildford to Hull, Exeter and . Gloucester to Bradford, and Cambridge to Wolverhampton. Ofcom stressed that call charges will not rise as a result. The watchdog said the changes are necessary ‘to safeguard the future supply of landline number across the UK’. It said: ‘In a small number of areas . of the UK, where phone numbers are becoming very scarce, people will . need to dial the whole number when making local calls. Ringing in the changes: Ofcom insists the move is the 'least disruptive' way to create thousands of new numbers in areas with a heavy demand . ‘This measure will enable Ofcom to . make more numbers available in those areas. Ofcom’s consumer research . shows this to be the least disruptive option for making new phone . numbers available for homes and businesses.' Currently, Ofcom cannot allocate phone . numbers in which the first digit after the area code is 0 or 1 - for . example, 01202 075 362 or 01273 118 903. This . is because the network computers may confuse the number with other . dialling codes or with a number reserved for special use, such as 118 . for directory enquiries. Once . a requirement to use the national code is in place, hundreds of . thousands of new local number combinations beginning 0 or 1 can be . created. Independent . research by analysts Futuresight found many consumers simply did not . believe that fixed line telephone numbers are running out. Trial: Bournemouth (pictured) will be one of the first places to experience the new system . However, some 51 out of 63 people involved in focus groups backed the scheme chosen by Ofcom, although there was some resistance with one describing the change as ‘a bit of nuisance’. Futuresight said: ‘For both businesses and consumers, closing the local dialling facility was seen as the least disruptive route and, behaviourally, an easy step.’ It added: ‘There is very clear evidence to suggest that whilst local dialling is still widely used by residential consumers and businesses, it is largely taken for granted and seen as ‘nice to have’, not a necessity. ‘Very few consumers or businesses had concerns if it was to disappear.’ One reason for the shortage of numbers is that several telecom giants are effectively hoarding blocks of numbers that might be issued to new customers at a future date. Ofcom is launching a pilot scheme to charge telecoms firms 10p a year for every phone number they hold to provide a financial incentive on them to give them up to people who need them.","Change is being planned to tackle a predicted shortage of telephone numbers .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Genetic liver disease has been cured in living, adult mice for first time using a ‘jaw-dropping’ genome-editing technique that could soon be used on humans. The technique, named Crispr, can make tiny changes to the huge database of the DNA molecule with what scientists describe as 'pinpoint' accuracy. Crispr – pronounced ‘crisper’- was used to correct a single ‘letter’ of the mices' genetic alphabet which had been mutated in the gene associated in liver metabolism. The technique, named Crispr, can make tiny changes to the huge database of the DNA molecule with what scientists describe as 'pinpoint' accuracy . Scientists claim a similar mutation in the same gene causes the inherited liver disease in humans, raising hopes that clinical trials on patients could begin in the next few years. They believe detailed alterations can be made to DNA, potentially allowing scientists to treat genetic disorders such as sickle-cell anaemia, Down's syndrome and Huntington’s disease. The new technique uses ‘cutting enzymes’ to target specific parts of the 23 pairs of human chromosomes, without introducing unintended mutations or flaws. The enzymes were discovered in 1987 and initially dismissed as ‘junk DNA’. It has since been identified as a defence used by bacteria against invading viruses. Genetic liver disease has been cured in living, adult mice for first time using a 'jaw-dropping- genome-editing technique that could soon be used on humans . The technique could mean detailed alterations can be made to DNA, potentially allowing scientists to treat genetic disorders such as sickle-cell anaemia (pictured), Down syndrome and Huntington's disease . Crispr – pronounced ‘crisper’- was used . to correct a single ‘letter’ of mice’s genetic alphabet which had been . mutated in the gene associated in liver metabolism. MIT researchers were able to cure the . rare disease in mice by changing around a third of their liver cells . using three guided RNA strands. The . RNA strands acted as ‘guide’ molecules to find the mutated base pair, . known as FAH. The Case9 enzyme, which was attached to the RNA, was then . able to repair the fault. Using . this approach, the correct gene was inserted in about one of every 250 . hepatocytes — the cells that make up most of the liver. Over the next 30 . days, those healthy cells began to multiply and replace diseased liver . cells. But its potential was only fully realised two years ago when scientists discovered that it can be combined with a DNA-sniping enzyme called Cas9 and used to edit the human genome. For this study, scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) used Crispr technology to find and correct the mutated DNA base pair in a liver gene called LAH. The mutation can lead to a deadly build-up of the amino acid tyrosine in 1 in 100,000 people and has to be treated with drugs and a low-protein diet.

Over the next 30 days, those healthy cells began to multiply and replace diseased liver cells. Nobel Prize winner Professor Craig Mello last year described the Crispr technique as 'a real game-changer' Scientists believe the technique is so accurate it might be used for gene therapy - replacing faulty genes with healthy ones - on incurable viruses such as HIV and diseases such as cancer. Controversially, it might also be used to correct gene defects in human IVF embryos, allowing disorders to be ‘ironed out’ before a baby is born. Previously gene therapy relied on using viruses to insert DNA at random into the human genome - an inaccurate and risky process. ‘What’s exciting about this approach is that we can actually correct a defective gene in a living adult animal,’ said MIT’s Daniel Anderson, the senior author of the paper. Scientists have developed other gene-editing systems based on DNA-slicing enzymes, also known as nucleases, but those complexes can be expensive and difficult to assemble. Earlier this year two Chinese . monkeys, named Ningning and Mingming, became the first . genetically-modified primates to be born using a powerful Crispr . technique. Writing in . the journal, Cell, the team from Nanjing Medical University reported the . successful delivery of twin female long-tailed macaques using the . technique. Scientists have . previously used the new genome-editing technology to delete, insert, and . modify DNA in human cells grown in petri dishes. ut . the new study showed for the first time that Crispr can create healthy . primates with their DNA modified at specific targeted genes. Jiahao . Sha, who led the Chinese team, said that Crispr could be used to create . monkeys that carry genetic faults that lead to diseases in humans for . animal testing. The . technology can also be used to grow human organs in the lab, and used to . test drugs, or to monitor how serious diseases can affect the body. Precise changes in DNA are also being investigated as a way to make people resistant to HIV. ‘The Crispr system is very easy to configure and customise,’ said Professor Anderson, who is also a member of MIT’s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science. He added that other systems ‘can potentially be used in a similar way to the Crispr system, but with those it is much harder to make a nuclease that’s specific to your target of interest.’ Last year, Nobel Prize winner Professor Craig Mello last night described the new technique as ‘a real game-changer’ Writing in the Independent, he said: ‘Crispr is absolutely huge. ‘It’s incredibly powerful and it has many applications, from agriculture to potential gene therapy in humans. ‘This is really a triumph of basic science. It’s a tremendous breakthrough with huge implications for molecular genetics. It’s a real game-changer. ‘It’s one of those things that you have to see to believe. I read the scientific papers like everyone else but when I saw it working in my own lab, my jaw dropped. A total novice in my lab got it to work.'","Named Crispr, technique can correct a single ‘letter’ of the genetic alphabet .

"By . Bianca London . Some women endure years of staggering and stumbling to master the art, while others’ efforts simply fall flat. But help is afoot – with classes in how to wear high heels. Clinician Martin Bell is so fed up with treating women for joint pain caused by their favourite footwear that he has devised a course to teach them to walk properly in their shoes. Clinician Martin Bell said he is inundated with complaints from women suffering back and knee pain caused by their high heels . Walk this way: Martin Bell, left, gives client Fiona Campbell tips on how best to walk in her killer heels . Mr Bell, 40, has been inundated with . women complaining of back and knee pain triggered by the ‘wonky’ way . they stand in high heels. He claims to have already helped hundreds by teaching them to use their leg muscles properly and ‘fight’ bad habits. And he warned that unless women learn to walk correctly in high heels, many more could end up with chronic joint problems. Mr Bell, a clinical orthotist who works with doctors to make and fit . braces and splints for patients, said: ‘When I see girls who wear heels . some of the most frequent problems related to them are weak knees and . back pain. ‘I work with them to look  at their physical strength and muscle tightness. ‘Our legs are shock absorbers, so if we aren’t walking properly they are going to hurt.’ Martin is keen on changing women's posture early on to avoid long-term damage . Mr Bell, of Clifton, Bristol, has introduced a ‘Perfectly Poised’ class . which involves filming a client walking in heels and using the footage . to analyse her walk. He examines each woman’s gait and posture and gives her exercises to help strengthen any weak muscles and ease pain. For those hoping for a shortcut to painless strolling in stilettos, he . warned there is no single approach that will suit everyone – but said he . generally encourages his clients to stand straight and avoid slouching, . which often involves tightening up leg and bottom muscles. Martin created 'Perfectly Poised' after he was inundated with women complaining of back and knee pain . Mr Bell added: ‘The difficulty is if a girl has never trained to improve . their muscle control and suddenly jumps into a pair of heels. The body . cannot understand what has happened and she runs the risk of going head . over heels like a newborn calf.’ But the good news is that he doesn’t advocate women ditching their heels entirely. He said: ‘From asking the girls they have all said that heels can give . extra height and confidence. They said it is head-turning, dynamic and . more powerful. ‘They just need to know how to walk in them properly.’ He said that unless women walk in high heels correctly they could end up with chronic joint problems which could take years to resolve .","Martin Bell, 40, launched course to help women correct their posture and avoid injury .

"By . Darren Boyle . A court in South Africa will decide the future of two four-year-old girls who were given to the wrong mothers after a mix-up in a maternity unit after they were born. The girls, who were both born on the same day in 2010, were handed to the wrong mothers after staff at the hospital made a mistake. The error only emerged when the ex-husband of one of the women wanted a DNA test to determine whether he was the child's father - only to discover that neither parent was biologically related to the girl. Both women gave birth to daughters on the same day in 2010 at the Tambo Memorial Hospital in Johannesburg . Th e man wanted confirmation that he was the biological father of the girl before he made maintenance payments. Once the error had been spotted, hospital officials contacted the second mother, informing her that she had taken home the wrong baby. However, the second woman is refusing to swap the child she has reared as her own for the past four years. Both children were born in the Tambo Memorial Hospital in Johannesburg although hospital staff have so far refused to explain how the error was made. Henk Strydom, a lawyer representing one of the women told Reuters: 'They did a paternity test and it was established that neither party was the parent of the child. They went back to the hospital and it was confirmed they had been swapped at birth. 'She was absolutely devastated. She was traumatised. My client wants her baby back. She is the biological mother of the child.' The case is currently before the North Gauteng High Court who will determine whether the children should be returned to their biological mothers. Neither of the families can be identified for legal reasons. Staff at the Tambo Memorial Hospital in Johannesburg, pictured, gave both mothers the wrong children when they were being discharged having given birth on the same day . Both women have met each other hand have been attending joint therapy sessions arranged by the hospital since December. The court has since tasked the University of Pretoria's Centre for child law to investigate what outcome will be in both children's best interests. The University has 90 days to return its findings to the court. A spokesperson for the centre said: 'We have been authorised to investigate the matter and to give our report and recommendations. It will be up to the court to make the final decision.' Mr Strydom compared the unfortunate situation to the story of King Solomon. He said: 'Someone has to make a very difficult decision. It really is a situation on a biblical scale.'","Both women gave birth to daughters on the same day in 2010 .

Publishing their findings in the scientific journal Nature, they said: ‘We attribute this warming primarily to wind farms. ‘The temperature change could be due to the effects of the energy expelled by farms and the movement and turbulence generated by turbine rotors. ‘These changes, if spatially large enough, may have noticeable impacts on local to regional weather and climate.’ But they warned that firm conclusions should not be drawn until more research had been carried out. As more wind farms are built, temperature increases may have a long-term impact on wildlife and regional weather patterns . Some scientists have suggested that giant wind farms, comprising hundreds of thousands of turbines, would not only alter the weather but could be used to control it. Britain currently has about 3,500 wind turbines, but there are plans to increase this to 10,000 onshore machines and 4,300 offshore by 2020. The world’s wind farms last year had the capacity to produce 238 gigawatts of electricity at any one time – a 21 per cent rise on 2010. Capacity is expected to reach nearly 500 gigawatts by the end of 2016 as more turbines are built, according to the Global Wind Energy Council.","Air temperatures around four of the .

"By . Wills Robinson . Husband: John Dewees, 49, is believed to have killed his 45-year-old wife Anja while she was drunk and then took her body to bed in Enfield, Connecticut . A husband who was fed up of changing his alcoholic wife's adult diapers punched her to death in a bathtub and wrapped her body in a deflated waterbed, prosecutors have said. Army veteran John Dewees, 49, is believed to have killed his 45-year-old wife Anja while she was drunk and then took her body to bed in Enfield, Connecticut. He is then said to have lived with his dead wife in their house for a few days and put her in the mattress to cover up the smell, according to the Hartford Courant. Dewees then told neighbours what had happened, and they phoned police. Officers turned up at the address and found Anja's body inside the deflated mattress which was wrapped in duct tape. Dewees, a father-of-one, said his wife had been bedridden with liver disease for around four years. The arrest warrant, issued by Enfield Police Department, said: 'He got up Wednesday and knew Anja was dead but didn't want to call anyone because he wanted to stay with her a couple of days. 'Dewees told me that he pushed Anja into the tub and that she fell onto . her right side and struck the right side of her head,' it continues. He said the pair had been drinking vodka and having a good time, but Dewees got angry after she soiled herself, saying she 'spoiled it'. Initially he told police he went to give her a bath, but then he admitted to pushing her inside the tub and punching her. 'He said he did it because he was tired of changing diapers every day,' the warrant adds. After he was arrested and charged, police placed him on suicide because he slashed his wrists to 'be in heaven with his wife'. Scene: Dewees is said to have kept his wife's body in their home for days after he 'pushed her into a bath and punched her' Public Defender Scott Abkowicz told the judge Dewees was honorably discharged from the US Army and has had a job in the aircraft manufacturing industry for 25 years. Carl Cianfarani, Dewees's best friend who was sat outside the court, said he was shocked that his friend had been charged with manslaughter because he was a 'very good husband'. His grown son told reporters outside court that he had abused and hit Anja for as far back as he could remember. Arrest: Dewees, a father-of-one, told neighbours what had happened, who then alerted the police.

"By . Will Payne In Los Angeles . The parents of virgin killer Elliot Rodger are 'grieving for those innocents who lost their lives, above their own son', according to a close family friend. Peter and Chin Rodger have been 'crippled by guilt' since their eldest child went on his bloody rampage on Friday – something they heard unfold on the radio as they raced up to Santa Barbara to be with the disturbed 22-year-old. And while they are heartbroken over the loss of their son, they are currently more distraught about the deaths of his six innocent victims. Close . friend and author Simon Astaire has spent the last few days with Chin, . Peter and his wife Soumaya and he says they are so upset they can . 'barely string a sentence together'. Scroll down for videos . Killer: Elliot Rodger, pictured, stabbed three friends and gunned down three other students in California last week as his parents rushed to find him. A family friend says they are crippled by guilt . Mr Astaire, who is acting as their spokesman, said: 'They are absolutely crippled by grief. I know them very well and it is incredibly hard to be in their company, because they are so distraught. It is hard to be near them because they are so devastated. 'I can tell you that they are grieving for those who've lost their lives before their own son. They really are, that's where they are. I can't imagine the confusion there must be in that? 'These are eloquent people and they can hardly get a sentence out. They are that mortified.' Speaking about the family and his own interactions with Elliot, he said: 'I have been with them from the very start of all this. They are great people and close friends. 'I always looked forward to coming to LA . because there wasn’t a moment when they didn't want to entertain you. And they had a kid, a kid called Elliot. Heartbroken: Peter Rodger is seen on Saturday, the day after his son went on a murderous rampage . Ripped apart: Peter Rodger is pictured left with his daughter Georgia. Right, Georgia and her mother, Chin. The parents are said to be more devastated about the six other victims than about the death of their own son . 'He was painfully shy, couldn't look at you straight in the eye and looked at your feet. It was unbearable. If you asked me last week I would have said he was one of the most reserved, self-contained guys you could ever meet. Family friend Simon Astaire . 'I remember a couple of Christmases ago I was having dinner with them. I went outside for a breather and there was Elliot, on his own and he was the loneliest figure I think I have ever seen. 'I remember thinking at the time, he was totally alone, a figure of solitude. I apologized and asked if I was interrupting and walked away. He was that kind of shy guy who you never talked to because he was so on his own you felt you were intruding even asking him a question.' And he insisted his friends had done everything they possibly could to avert the massacre, even racing up to the campus to try to intervene after seeing his chilling YouTube video in which he reveals his bloody plans. Victims: Rodger's first victims included his roommates Weihan Wang, left, and Cheng Yuan Hong, right . Gunned down: George Chen, left, was also found . stabbed to death in their home - although he did not live at the house - . while Rodgers gunned down Chris Michael-Martinez, right, when he opened . fire at a deli . Loss: Katie Cooper, left, and Veronika Weiss . were standing outside a sorority house when they were shot . Mr Astaire said: 'He was in therapy from the age of nine and to the very last moment they were in a chase to save their son. They raced up to try to save him, it's everyone's nightmare. You're driving up to Santa Barbara and you hear a black BMW is involved.' Astaire . Since the shocking incident it has been revealed that police had contact with Rodger three times while he was living in Isla Vista, but they failed to see any warning signs. On one occasion, a family member called and asked officers to check on Rodger because they were worried about his mental state. In his warped 141-page manifesto, he describes the incident, saying: 'If they had demanded to search my room ... (t)hat would have ended everything. For a few horrible seconds, I thought it was all over.... [T]he police would have searched my room, found all of my guns and weapons, along with my writings about what I plan to do with them. Sadness: Students mourn the students who were killed by Rodger in a candlelit vigil at the weekend . 'I would have been thrown in jail, denied of the chance to exact revenge on my enemies. I can't imagine a hell darker than that.' But Rodger’s parents don't blame the authorities at all. Mr Astaire said: 'They don't place any blame on the police, because Elliot fooled everyone, no one knew the man he was turning into. 'He seemed a sensitive guy, there was nothing aggressive about him, there was no anger. No one recognizes the person portrayed in the manifesto. He didn’t act in that way, he was just in his own world. He didn’t once speak about guns. 'If you look at the amount of therapists they took him to, it is clear he did all he could. He's writing with anger, but he constantly references how they tried to make him feel better.'","Peter and Chin Rodger are more distraught about the deaths of their son's six victims, a close friend told MailOnline .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A shocking photograph was posted onto Taco Bell's Facebook page yesterday showing an unnamed employee licking a long stack of taco shells. The image was posted onto the company's official page by 'Jj O'Brien Nolan', along with the comment 'This sure says a lot about your employees'. The employee hasn't been identified nor has his relationship to the poster. Tongue lashing: This Taco Bell employee lost his job after this photograph was posted to the Taco Bell Facebook page and went viral . However, some commentators are . speculating the outlet is in Ridgecrest, California. Others claim it is just . a joke and the shells were stale and headed for the bin rather than for . public consumption. 'Regardless . of the circumstances,  an employee should never represent themselves . and their employer in such a manner, especially when you are working in . the food service industry,' said one commenter. 'This just makes me hungry,' stated another. Despite the risks of being caught, this isn't the first time fast food workers have gotten into hot water over questionable treatment of food photographed and posted to social media. Taco trials: Taco Bell isn't new to controversy on social media, with the latest incident just one in a series of embarrassing instances of employees photographed playing with their food . In April, a KFC worker posted photographs of herself licking a pile of mashed potatoes on Facebook and was promptly fired by her employer. Last year, three Burger King employees from Ohio were fired after images of them standing in two bins full of shredded lettuce were uploaded to their Facebook pages. And in another shameful Taco Bell image, a worker tweeted a photograph of himself urinating into a plate of nachos in August last year. Viral: Taco Bell's Facebook page has filled with comments regarding the incident varying from the outraged to the amused . ‘I pissed on them where nobody could see, in private, an[d] I threw them away. There’s literally nothing they can do. Fire me. I don’t care,’ Cameron Jankowski of Fort Wayne said of the photo. Taco Bell took him up on his offer and he was relieved of duties immediately. The latest fast food atrocity is likely to result in the same fate for the taco-licking employee, if he is indeed still working there. Taco Bell has not commented on the photograph.","Unnamed Taco Bell employee photographed licking a stack of taco shells .

"By . James Tozer . Updated: . 03:50 EST, 6 July 2011 . A takeaway worker who claimed asylum in Britain went on to groom 18 schoolgirls for sexual abuse. Foot fetishist Homayon Narouzzad, 33, who had claimed he was fleeing persecution in Iran, targeted children as young as 12 when they came in to buy food. Paying them as little as £5 to take part in sex acts centred around feet in his flat above the takeaway, the fitness fanatic afterwards gave them ‘star ratings’ when he stored their numbers in his mobile.. Admission: Narouzzad pleaded guilty at a previous hearing to 25 counts of sexual activity with a child under 16 . The case is the latest to highlight a . trend of men frequently from Asian backgrounds systematically grooming . predominantly white schoolgirls for abuse. While the victims are often from ‘vulnerable’ backgrounds, the girls . targeted by Narouzzad – who was jailed yesterday for four years – were . mainly from stable homes. Narouzzad arrived in Britain in 2000 and began working at the Family Guy . takeaway in Whitefield, near Manchester, living in a flat above it. The tattooed body-builder was a popular figure in the area, known by . teenagers who flocked to the café as ‘Smiley’ for his happy demeanour.. Takeaway worker: Narouzzad was working at the Family Guy takeaway shop in Whitefield, Bury, Greater Manchester, and living in a flat above the shop . He was finally granted leave to remain in Britain last year but by then . he was already exploiting his friendly image to target girls for abuse. In exchange for free food and cash, he would get the girls – many still . dressed in their school uniforms – to let him kiss their feet or perform . sex acts upon him. They were paid from as little as £5 up to around £90 depending on the . kind of abuse they would submit to. Corrupting: Narouzzad was told by the judge that he had destroyed the innocence of his victims . One 13-year-old unwittingly acted as . a ‘pimp’, recruiting friends who in some cases in turn brought along . their younger sisters, creating a ring of girls aged between 12 and 15 . subjected to regular sexual abuse. Another girl came to his flat when she ‘wanted money to buy hair extensions’, the court heard. The abuse went on for a year before one of the girls confided in her mother. Police believe the girls did not initially regard what he was asking . them to do as sexual abuse, but over time some became withdrawn and . traumatised. Narouzzad pleaded guilty to 25 offences of sexual activity . with a child at Bolton Crown Court. In a letter read to the court, he stated his ‘sincere apologies and . remorse to the victims and families’. But Judge Maureen Roddy told him . he had left the girls with a nightmare to bear. Afterwards detectives said the case showed how easily such systematic abuse could remain undiscovered. Child exploitation experts say key warnings signs include girls having . extra money to buy clothes or new mobiles, but in this case the victims . themselves were careful not to arouse suspicion by displaying new . purchases. Last week a report by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection . Centre found a ‘disproportionate’ number of Asian men were behind . ‘street grooming’ offences. It found that out of 2,379 offenders suspected of attempting to lure . vulnerable victims, often using drugs and alcohol, over the past three . years, 28 per cent were Asian.",Iranian claimed asylum in Britain saying he was fleeing persecution .

"By . Lydia Warren . Updated: . 23:55 EST, 28 January 2012 . Six passengers who travelled on the doomed Costa Concordia cruise liner are suing the ship's owner for $460 million - days after the company offered each passenger just $14,400. The payout - which extends to all surviving passengers, including children - is to cover the cost of the cruise, loss of luggage, expenses incurred staying in Italy after the disaster and travel home. But lawyers are urging passengers not to take the bait, claiming they could be entitled to much more. Now six passengers, who filed a suit . against Costa Cruises in Miami, Florida, are demanding more cash, . alleging that the ship operator was guilty of negligence in the run up . to the January 13 disaster. 'Terror of death': Passengers from Miami have sued the cruise liner company $460 million for their distress . The lawyer acting for the passengers, Marc Bern, said the legal action was launched on Friday in a court in Miami, where the headquarters of parent company Carnival Cruise Lines is based. The complaint said the survivors were 'in terror of catastrophic injury, death, drowning, having been placed in a situation where common sense said the vessel was sinking but the orders from the crew were to return to their cabins', Radar Online reported. Bern added: 'There is not one uninjured person on that ship, whether or not they have a physical scratch. The anxiety, the stress for many of these people will never leave them.' It comes a day after a Peruvian crew member filed a suit in Chicago for $100 million compensation. By comparison, the offered payouts will cost the company just $50 million, although injured passengers will be dealt with on top of this. Those who accept the offer must agree to . drop all future legal actions against Costa Cruises, according to the . agreement, and will be paid within a week. Pay off: Owners of the Costa Concordia offered passengers, . including children, $14,400 each in compensation . The company expressed their 'profound . condolences' as they announced the package, which they said was 'higher . than any current indemnification limits'. Herbert Greszuk was at the bar on the fifth deck of the Costa Concordia when the luxury liner hit a reef. Unable . to get back to his second-deck cabin after the emergency signal came, . he made it to a lifeboat with only the clothes on his back - leaving . behind everything he had with him for the cruise, including his tuxedo, . camera, jewelry, credit cards, identity papers and even his dentures. The . 62-year-old, who runs a small flower shop and cafe in the western . German town of Recklinghausen, counts himself lucky to have escaped the . ship after it capsized. But he estimates that he lost at least $8,300 in goods alone. He . said: 'It's about accountability. Something like this must not be . allowed to happen again. So many people died; it's simply inexcusable.' He added: 'I feel so lost and alone. Nobody is helping us out. 'I called the travel agency and they . said it's not our problem any more, call Costa. I called Costa and they . said they'd get back to me, but as of today, I haven't heard a word.' But Italian environmental group Codacons . has urged survivors to join a class-action lawsuit it is coordinating . with U.S. and Italian law firms, claiming each passenger could be . awarded $165,000. 'All those who were on board the ship are . entitled to be compensated not only for material damage, but also to . moral ones, such as fear and terror suffered, and the risks related to . physical integrity,' its website reads. 'It is inadmissible, despite the . sophisticated equipment on board such vessels, installed in order to . avoid clashes aground, such accidents occur.' Giulia Bongiorno, an attorney who has . gathered around 50 survivors for a lawsuit, told the Daily Beast: . 'Throwing money at survivors to effectively get them out of sight is not . what we have in mind. 'These people have no idea what their . agonising experience is worth yet. It could take years to understand . the full impact of the experience.' Lawsuits are expected to be filed in . Germany, Italy, the United States and elsewhere. Attorney . Hans Reinhardt, who represents a . dozen German survivors, said passengers did sign liability wavers . - a common requirement for cruises - but that he considers them void . under the circumstances. He . said: 'You do not sign off on a disaster situation, what you sign there . is for normal daily situations like if there is a little storm or high . water or something like that. 'This was such a large failure by the captain and by Costa that you can . sign whatever you want but you will still get your money.' Disaster: Passengers were . taken to safety by lifeboats launched into the night seas. The ship's . owners say they will receive the compensation for their losses and . experiences as a result of the incident . The uproar comes as recovery operations . on the sunken ship yielded a body of a woman who was not wearing a life . jacket, bringing the total number of deaths to 17. Fifteen are still . missing. Rough seas off Italy's Tuscan coast . forced a delay in the planned start of the operation to remove the fuel . and officials said pumping may now not begin until midweek. The Concordia ran aground . on January 13 off the port of the island of Giglio port after the . captain deviated from his planned route and gashed the hull of the ship . on a reef. Some 4,200 . passengers and crew endured a panicked evacuation after the abandon ship . alarm didn't sound until the ship had capsized so much that some life . boats couldn't be lowered. The Concordia's captain, Francesco . Schettino, remains under house arrest, accused of manslaughter, causing a . shipwreck and abandoning a ship before its passengers had evacuated. He has admitted he took the ship on 'tourist navigation' to bring it . close to Giglio but said the reef he hit wasn't marked on his nautical . charts.","Passengers urged to reject offer that will cost Costa Cruises $52 million .

"By . Ryan Gorman . An Apple employee has filed suit with the company claiming that racism has led to him being denied a promotion. Andrew Dupree, 31, of Orlando, Florida, says in the suit that he took his concerns about African-Americans being denied opportunities for advancement all the way to CEO Tim Cook, but that he was ignored and left with no choice but to take his case to court. A complaint filed December 18 with the Florida Commission on Human Relations obtained by Radar Online details management’s alleged preference for white employees. He also claimed that a manager once told him that ‘black employees don’t reach management in this market,’ in an interview with the website. Where it happened: The Apple Store at the Millennia Mall, in Orlando, Florida . ‘When I was in the Orlando Store under the Supervision of [redacted], Senior Manager, she had make a statement prior to me transferring to Australia that Blacks in the Orlando location don’t have a chance to make it to management,’ the document reads. ‘I did not express my concern to management at that time because I was transferring to Australia.’ He the dramatically increased the results of the tech giant’s ‘Easy Pay Program,’ which encourages shoppers to make in-store purchases from their Apple devices, from 1.4 per cent of total sales to 14 per cent after arriving in Sydney, he said. Dupree believes those results merited a promotion. ‘I did numbers myself and then I trained employees. I wrote a full synopsis to make it a sustainable goal for entire store,’ said Dupree. He then decided to return to the U.S. after a year down under and was rebuffed by the Orlando store. Taken all the way to the top: Dupree claims he voiced his concerns directly to Apple CEO Tim Cook, but was instead offered a meeting with two human resources representatives . ‘I was not given a job, despite being told that I was going to be given a transfer, because of one manager’s racism,’ insisted Dupree. ‘I blew the horn as loud as humanly possible and they did nothing,’ he continued. ‘I want the focus to be on Tim Cook, Apple and their failure to address the racism in the company. Racism that they knew about.’ The document further explained Dupree’s claims. ‘Once [redacted] got involved with the transfer process I was denied a transfer to a management or leadership position. There are no Blacks at the Orlando Store that hold a leadership position or have opportunities to be promoted to management position. ‘I believe that my upward ability at the Orlando Store is being hindered by [redacted] intention to discriminate against Blacks who are qualified to a hold a management position,’ says the lawsuit. Dupree further illustrated his claims of being discriminated against by recalling the time a white manager even musing about R&B singer Justin Timberlake. ‘I’ve heard her referencing Justin Timberlake having more talent than other R&B artists and it pissed her off that black artists say he stole their style of music and that he’s so popular because he’s a white artist doing black music,’ he claimed. Dupree took his claims directly to the top, asking August 28, 2013, via email for a meeting with Cook, but was instead offered a talk with two human resources representatives the following month. That meeting instead happened in October 2013, but nothing came of it, said Dupree, leading to him filing his lawsuit. ‘I filed my complaint because of what I have seen and heard in my market,’ he said. ‘You hear it so much that you get numb to it. ‘Then I tried to move up the ladder and nothing happened. I watched people around me who did less work getting promoted and none of them were black. The last straw was when my manager destroyed my chances of moving up.’ An Apple spokesperson told Radar Online that the company responded to his claims earlier this month but offered no further comment.","Andrew Dupree claims he was denied a promotion at an Orlando Apple Store by racist management .

"By . Dan Bloom . Disciples of a millionaire spiritual guru have refused to have him cremated because they say he is meditating - in a freezer. Now the wife and son of His Holiness Shri Ashutosh Maharaj, who is said to be worth £100million, have reportedly launched a court battle to retrieve his body after saying he died in January. His followers at the Divya Jyoti Jagrati Sansthan (Divine Light Awakening Mission) insist he is just in a 'deep meditative state', and called on followers to stand by his 31-year-old sect 'under all circumstances'. He's not dead, he's restin'! Disciples of religious guru His Holiness Shri Ashutosh Maharaj (pictured) say he entered a meditative state on January 29, so they put him in a freezer and are still waiting for him to wake up . Described as 'an exceptional awakened being with a divine persona' whose 'ever-enthusiastic charisma has re-kindled a spirit of a positive aura and has directed many towards a constructive path across the globe', the guru founded his Hindu order in 1983 and is in his seventies. There are missions in his name around the world, including the U.S., Canada, Switzerland, Germany and even a British base in a small suburban house in west London. But according to reports, doctors declared the guru clinically dead of a heart attack on January 29 - a verdict his loyal followers refused to accept. Insisting he was in a deep spiritual state called samadhi, they placed him in a deep freezer on the outskirts of the Punjab city of Jalandhar and waited for him to wake up. Four months later, they are still waiting. In the meantime they say their leader . has been grateful for the many phone calls, e-mails and even personal . visits he has received. Guarded: Followers of the guru at a police checkpoint next to his retreat on the outskirts of Jalandhar, Punjab . Now the spiritual guru's wife and son Dilip Jha, 40, have filed a court claim to obtain his body for cremation and have called on police to investigate his death, according to the Daily Telegraph. It comes after a previous court challenge to the placing of the guru in a freezer by a man claiming to be his former driver. It was alleged his followers were keeping him in the guarded freezer so they could claim a share of his vast wealth. Mission spokesman Swami Vishalanand said scores of spiritual leaders throughout history had survived after months of samadhi in the Himalayas, which have freezer-like conditions. '[He] is still sending messages through followers in their meditative stage to protect his body until he returns,' Mr Vishalanand added. Popular: The guru founded his order in 1983 and it now has branches in the U.S., Canada, Germany and Britain . A statement on the religious order's website said: 'His Holiness Shri Ashutosh Maharaj ji has been in deep meditative state (Samadhi) since 29th January 2014. 'Divya Jyoti Jagrati Sansthan appreciates innumerous individuals and organisations for re-affirming their commitment to the organisation through phone calls, emails, messages and personal visits. 'The sansthan acknowledges your pledge to stand by the organisation under all circumstances.' Reeta Kohli, additional advocate general of Punjab state, said previously: 'The man is clinically dead and it is up to his followers to decide what they want to do with the body.'","Family of His Holiness Ashutosh Majaraj say he's been dead for months .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . A former drill sergeant at a Missouri Army post is accused of raping four female soldiers and sexually assaulting eight others and investigators fear there could be even more victims. Staff Sergeant Angel M Sanchez allegedly used his rank and position to coerce the women into sex and intimidated them not to report the assaults. At least one of the attacks occurred while he and a victim were deployed to Afghanistan, according to investigators. Sanchez appeared at a pretrial hearing at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, on Wednesday and could face a court-martial later this year, the Washington Post reported. Most of the attacks occurred on Fort Leonard Wood, a military post 150 miles southeast of St. Louis, investigators said . Military prosecutors allege that, among other things, Sanchez used his position as a drill sergeant on the Army post to threaten some of the women he's accused of assaulting. He is accused of sexually assaulting four women and assaulting eight others by touching them inappropriately, Tiffany Wood, a Fort Leonard Wood spokeswoman, told the newspaper. Sanchez served one tour each in Iraq and Afghanistan, earning a Bronze Star. He arrived at the Missouri post in August and trained new soldiers with the 14th Military Police Brigade, but he no longer performs drill-sergeant duty and now works an office job with his unit, Wood said. Several of the women Sanchez is accused of attacking testified at Wednesday's hearing. Sanchez's lawyer, Ernesto Gapasin, told the paper 'there are a lot of issues with the credibility of the witnesses and the government's case.' He said Sanchez was told of the charges by his commanding officer on May 13. According to the charging documents, Sanchez's alleged crimes date back to his year in Afghanistan, which lasted from March 2011 until March 2012. Prosecutors allege that during that time, Sanchez raped a female service member in a temporary housing unit for women on the base. He is also accused of sexually harassing female soldiers during that time. Prosecutors also allege that Sanchez committed several sexual assaults at Fort Leonard Wood between September 17, 2013 and January 31, 2014. In one attack, Sanchez made a soldier fear she would be kicked out of the Army if she didn't engage in sexual acts, the charging documents state. He forced her to perform oral sex on him in an office he shared with other drill sergeants, military officials said. Sexual assault has been a front-burner issue for the Pentagon, Congress and the White House over the past year, triggering Capitol Hill hearings and persistent questions about how effectively the military was preventing and prosecuting assaults and how well it was treating the victims. Fueling outrage have been high-profile assault cases and arrests, including incidents involving senior commanders, sexual assault prevention officers and military trainers. At the same time, the military has long struggled to get victims to report sexual assault in a stern military culture that emphasizes rank, loyalty and toughness. Some victims have complained they were afraid to report assaults to ranking officers for fear of retribution, or said that their initial complaints were rebuffed or ignored. The Senate passed a bill in March that would remove military commanders' ability to overturn sexual assault convictions, provide alleged victims with an independent lawyer, and require convicted military members to be sentenced to a dishonorable discharge, at the minimum. The House hasn't voted on the bill.","Staff Sergeant Angel M Sanchez was a drill instructor at Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri .

"By . Ruth Styles . From Sophie Wessex and Princess Eugenie to the Duchess of Cambridge, milliner Jane Taylor, the brains behind the Jane Taylor label, boasts some impressively grand names among her army of devoted fans. Now Ms Taylor, who has been designing bespoke and ready-to-wear hats since 2008, has been named the hat partner of choice for this year's Royal Ascot. So what does take to get past the Ascot fashion police and straight onto the best-dressed list?  FEMAIL asked Taylor for her top tips - here's what she said: . Hats you win: Elaborate hats of varying levels of wackiness are an essential part of the Royal Ascot experience . THE BASICS . 'The perfect hat should be flattering for the wearer and confidence boosting,' explains Taylor. 'Finding the right one totally depends on the person wearing it.' For Taylor, that means taking your face shape and complexion into account when hunting for the perfect Ascot accessory. 'You should always complement your face with the shape of a hat,' insists Taylor. 'For example, if your face is round, wear an angular hat that cuts across your face. 'Or if your face is more angular, soften it was a rounded hat and a soft trim.  If you’re wearing a cocktail hat, wear it pointed down so it nearly touches your eyebrow.' Pretty: The £795 Alyssa cocktail hat is perfect for weddings . Stylish: The £475 Snowdrop cocktail hat comes in bold cobalt . Elaborate: The Elodie, £755, comes in fashionable coral pink . Royal fans: The Countess of Wessex (left) and the Duchess of Cambridge are both fans of the label . Big business: Jane Taylor is the brains behind the increasingly popular millinery brand Jane Taylor . GO BOLD . With the perennially popular fascinator banned by Ascot's fashion police this time around, Taylor says it's time to consider swapping it for something a little more exciting. Along with wide-brimmed hats, options include berets, perchers or Sophie Wessex' favourite small disc shaped hats. 'I would suggest a small cocktail hat,' adds Taylor. 'There are plenty of different shapes to choose from if you'd rather avoid a large brims.' CHOOSE QUALITY . With designer hats costing more than many Ascot-goers can afford, finding a quality hat on the high street can be a challenge. There is, however, a simple solution. 'I absolutely love coming across vintage . millinery,' explains Taylor. 'They are finely made and the quality and . finished effect is really outstanding.' Along with costing less than a designer number, vintage hats are also unique which means you won't have to worry about doubling up with another guest. TRY OUT A NEW TREND . While not everyone wants to risk ridicule by being spotted out and about in a flamboyant piece of millinery, there's no reason not to try something new. 'Big brims and stylised boater hats are huge news for this summer,' explains Taylor. 'Small tailored cocktail hats, pastels and coral are also a good choice, while aqua and nude are going to be as popular as ever this year.' Fun: While human hats require some thought, for canine Ascot goers such as Zoe (above), anything goes . Quirky: Ascot is famous for its unusual hats such as this tiered cake design . Bright stuff: Colourful coral hats such as this one are set to be popular this year . Personality: According to Taylor, letting your personality shine through is good . Make sure the new hat works with your complexion but don't be afraid to let your personality shine through. 'People choose hats to show off their . personality,' adds Taylor, 'and I always admire the people who choose more elaborate . pieces as they have the confidence to pull them off.' LOOK TO THE ROYALS FOR INSPIRATION . The Duchess of Cambridge and the Countess of Wessex always look impeccably turned out, and that, says Taylor, is because they've nailed the perfect styling formula. 'The perfect Ascot outfit is a simple tailored dress in a classic shape, worn with a exquisite elaborate hat,' explains Taylor, who says the Countess of Wessex is a favourite client. 'I have designed for the Countess of Wessex for many years and she is always a pleasure to work with,' adds Taylor. But it's always lovely to see my pieces worn by the Royal Family.' Jane Taylor will be among the leading milliners appearing at Fenwick's emergency hat clinics starting on June 10th. For more information, see fenwick.co.uk. Royal Ascot starts on 17th June and runs until the 21st. See ascot.co.uk for more information and tickets.

"By . Richard Spillett . Britain was the in the depths of war, and in the fields of Flanders, his Army comrades were fighting and all too often dying. But for Second Lt the Hon Rowland George Winn it was an affair of the heart which threatened to end his war: the Coldstream Guards officer was forced out of his regiment for marrying a 'chorus girl'. The love affair between the future Lord St Oswald and Evie Carew scandalised high society and seemed a timely distraction from the increasing sense of despair in 1915 for a nation which had thought the war would be 'over by Christmas'. Now fresh details of the 'scandal' - although Lt Winn would not have seen it that way - have emerged after the full background of Miss Carew were studied for an exhibition on the affair. The marriage of aristocratic army officer Rowland George Winn (pictured) and stage-girl Evie Carew sent tremors through British high society 100 years ago . The affair between Lt Winn and Miss Carew was certainly unlikely. Lt Winn had been educated at Eton and Sandhurst before the war was sent into battle in August 1914 aged just 21. He . was given a three-day 'coming of age' party at his family's huge estate . before his departure for the front, at which 500 people were . entertained for three days. He was one of the British Expeditionary Force sent to stop the German invasion of France against overwhelming odds - the British Army in total was a tenth the size of the German one, and was involved in a bloody rearguard action in which eventually it stopped the advance at Mons. In . November 1914, his family wrongly received the tragic news that he had . been killed in action after his name was listed among those of the dead. In fact he was wounded. But their grief was caused by a mistake by the War Department, which had wrongly categorised their son's injuries as a death. What exactly happened next is unclear. What is known is that Evie was working as a chorus girl at a theatre, taking part in productions such as Gypsy Love and the Marriage Market. She had to work long hours, six days a week for low wages, although there was a glamorous side to the profession - meeting wealthy audience members. It must have been there that they met - and in October 1915 they secretly married at St Saviour's Church in Paddington, west London. Shortly before the couple's wedding, . members of his regiment had been involved in the Battle of Festubert, in . which the British lost more than 16,000 men in an attack on German . lines. Two months later the union ceased to be a secret, and was front-page news in a series of newspapers. It became known as the affair of the peer and the showgirl. Despite reports describing Miss Carew as 'one of the most beautiful and charming chorus girls on the London stage', the union was not received well by Winn's family or his regiment. The union caused a scandal in the newspapers of the time, as this cutting from the Daily Mirror shows . Despite being embroiled . in war, the perceived affront to the regiment's association with the . royal household was said to make his position untenable. As part of the Guards Division, Coldstream Guards officers were felt to be obliged to follow the conventions of the royal household at the time. An aristocrat could not marry a commoner and remain part of the royal social circle; by extension an officer could not serve his Guards commission fully if he had married beneath himself. Amid the growing scandal, the . soldier quickly transferred to the 13th Squadron of the Royal Flying . Corps, which did not have such strict codes of conduct. But he appeared to enjoy his change of path in the military and described his new role in the war effort to his father after he . was made Captain in 1916. For many years Evie, pictured with one of her children, was kept away from official functions . He wrote: 'The Bosch has been dropping bombs . round about us, in retaliation for our nightly (and daily) excursions . behind his lines with the same purpose – but [we] have dropped . considerably more than he (and these much larger than his) and have done . him a great deal of damage, I’m pleased to say.' In fact the change may well have saved his life. He served as a staff officer in the RFC, the predecessor of the RAF, rather than fighting in the trenches as the Guards did. He survived the war - one of a small number who had served continuously from 1914 to 1918. It did not, however, end the chill which had affected his social status. Because . of his new wife's status, the future third Baron St Oswald was not . allowed to take her to any official family functions - and for years her . name was kept out of all records. The . affair - which came twenty years before King Edward VIII abdicated so . he could marry a commoner - was echoed in a Downton Abbey plot when Lady . Sybil married Tom Branson, a 'lowly' driver. Little . had been known about Evie's life before she met and fell in love with . the Lord, with experts speculating that they may have met while she was . working at Daly's Theatre in London. But . research for a new exhibition has unveiled fresh details of the . relationship, including that Evie Carew was actually her stage name, and . her real name was Nellie Greene. Researchers . studying her family tree have also found she was the daughter of a . restaurant manager - making her marriage to a blue-blooded aristocrat . all the more remarkable. The . new details have been included in a show about the scandalous marriage . at the Winn family's stately home - Nostell Priory in Wakefield, West . Yorkshire, run by the National Trust. Dr Sarah . Burnage, who is leading the project, says as son and heir there was a . lot of pressure on Rowland, whose controversial marriage rocked a family . already facing mounting debts. She said: 'There was a lot of expectation on Rowland George Winn which makes his marriage to a chorus girl seem all the more dramatic and sensational and problematic for the family. 'We have done some digging here and her real name was not Evie Carew, it was Nellie Greene. Historians uncovered new information about about the scandalous marriage ahead of a show at the Winn family's stately home, Nostell Priory in West Yorkshire . 'We found out that her father was a restaurant manager, her sister married a miner and her brother worked on the stage. 'We think is her route into acting and working on the stage she was from a very different social class to Rowland Winn.' Commenting . on the union, Dr Burnage added: 'It must have been devastating news and . such a scandal. His marriage had quite significant consequences. 'The . Coldstream Guards is associated with the Royal household and a rule had . been brought in that actresses could not be presented at court. 'So . when he married Evie he was not able to present his wife at official . functions. And he was an officer in the Guards so he actually had to . resign his commission and instead join the Royal Flying Corps.' It is thought the couple met when Miss Carew was working at Daly's Theatre in London's Leicester Square . Letters . from Rowland to his father reveal the older man's original doubts at . the marriage, causing his son to write letters attempting to persuade . him of Evie's 'better qualities'. The son describes her as 'anything but the average chorus girl' and says she is 'incredibly charming'. Despite that, it appears that Evie was not wholly accepted as her name is not listed among the guests at family functions. But, . despite the shock to his parents, it is believed that they were . eventually won over by Evie, who became Lady Winn when her husband . inherited his father's title after the war. A generation later, the archives reveal . that the actress-turned-Lady was immersed in the life of Nostell Priory . and the community. The couple went on to have two children . and archives reveal that the Dowager Lady Oswald - their grandmother - was happy to . buy expensive coats for their children, suggesting that the ice had,at least to some degree, melted. Lord St Oswald died in 1957 and was succeeded by his son, also Rowland, the fourth Lord St Oswald, while his wife died in 1976. Their story will be told as part of World War One At Home - local stories from a global conflict on BBC Radio Leeds, BBC Radio Sheffield and BBC Radio York from 2 - 6 June. The story of the Wakefield heir and the showgirl - and the marriage which rocked their families - will be on air Thursday 5 June 2014 at 8.15am.","Marriage of officer and stage girl caused scandal during First World War .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A giant coffee shop billboard featuring a naked woman is brewing controversy in Washington, with locals demanding the racy sign be pulled down. A picture of a blonde woman bearing her rear in a tiny g-string adorns the 10-foot-tall mobile billboard, parked on the side of various busy highways to promote two lingerie coffee bars. While the unidentified business owner insists she has a right to advertise her coffee stands as she chooses, some locals are disgusted at the graphic nudity. 'It's completely unacceptable and I am offended,' mother-of-four Susan Evans told KXLY.com, noting she once ate with her family across the street from the sign. 'This must be taken down.' Scroll down for video . Controversy brewing: Some locals are outraged at this billboard for 2nd Base Lingerie Espresso which features a nude woman with wings on a Washington state highway .

The saucy sign is moved between 2nd Base Lingerie Espresso on East Sprague in Spokane Valley and Big Shots Espresso in Spokane city. The owner of both outlets, who refused to be identified, told KHQ.com that she is not concerned with the community's frustration, and is focused on running her business. The woman who appears on the billboard, identified by My Fox Orlando as Amanda Bennett, agrees. Bennett, a mother who works as a bikini barista at Big Shots Espresso, told Fox the sign shows nothing more than you'd see at the beach. 'At least I have a job,' she said. 'I could be a mom out on the side of a road begging for money like all the people downtown or living in a homeless shelter, but this takes care of my family.'

'I thought it was funny for a minute, but the second after that it was kind of like - kids [will be] driving by and looking at stuff,' Miguel Hernandez, also a restaurant employee in the area, said. Resident Kevina Howe told Fox: 'I think women should have more self respect than that and they don’t and that just baffles me.' Joey Johnston, who works at a nearby burger shop, said he can see why families are angry. 'This is a family restaurant and this area, people drive by all the time,' Johnston told KXLY.com. 'Like I said, I don't have a problem with it, maybe if it was just a little less revealing.'

"By . Associated Press . LeVar Burton's fundraising effort to bring Reading Rainbow to the online masses is a by-the-book success - and he can barely contain his excitement. The beloved TV host launched a Kickstarter on Wednesday to bring the popular children's book series online, stating he needed $1 million by July 2 to launch the project. But within hours, he achieved his target, with more than 23,000 donors pledging their support. This means Burton and his team can share Reading Rainbow's extensive collection of digital books and videos with classrooms around the country for a low fee. 'I am overwhelmed. Thank you so much. This is going to enable us to really, really, really do a lot of good,' Burton, who hosted the adored reading program from the early 1980s until recently, said. Scroll down for video . Shocked: LeVar was 'overwhelmed' when his Reading Room fundraiser on Kickstarter reached $1 million after its first day . Overwhelmed: A visibly emotional LeVar Burton made an articulate speech thanking people who donated to the good cause . 'I am so proud that this community . has come together to support this effort. It's the people's thing. It's . the five, it's the 10, is the 25, it's the $1 pledges,' he added, crying. 'It's . unbelievable. Or, it's actually very believable. Thank you so much, we . are literally changing the world one children's book at a time.' Now, more than 48,000 backers have pledged over $1.9 million to the project. 'It was my mother who taught me that, by picking up a book, I could 'go anywhere' and 'be anything',' Burton said in a posting on Kickstarter. Contributors can claim rewards ranging from autographed memorabilia to a private dinner with Burton to a chance to put on the visor that the actor wore on Star Trek: The Next Generation. 'We're not just getting pledges, but so much email love that our server froze,' said Mark Wolfe, Burton's business partner. 'I'm so happy to help. LeVar taught me to read,' is among the typical messages, he said.

"By . Emma Glanfield . Four acoustic 'pings' which were at the centre of the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 are no longer believed to be from the aircraft's black box, a US Navy official has claimed. Australian search authorities narrowed the search for the jet, which disappeared in March, after picking up a series of pings near where analysis of satellite data put the last location of the Boeing 777, some 1,600 km off Australia's northwest coast. But according to Michael Dean, the US Navy's deputy director of ocean engineering, authorities now almost universally believe the pings did not come from the onboard data or cockpit voice recorders. Scroll down for video . Four acoustic 'pings' which were at the centre of the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 are no longer believed to be from the aircraft's black box, a US Navy official has claimed (file picture) Australian search authorities narrowed the search for the jet after picking up a series of pings near where analysis of satellite data put the last location of the Boeing 777, some 1,600km off Australia's northwest coast . He believes the pings instead came from some other man-made source unrelated to the jetliner which disappeared on March 8 carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew. Speaking to CNN, Mr Dean said: ‘Our best theory at this point is that (the pings were) likely some sound produced by the ship ... or within the electronics of the Towed Pinger Locator.’ He also said that if the pings had come from the plane’s flight recorders then searchers would have found them and confirmed other countries agreed with his theory. The discovery of the pings on April 5 and 8 was hailed as a significant breakthrough but no further promising signals were heard before the expiry of the batteries on the black box's locator beacons. A scan of the area around the pings with an unnamed submarine failed to find any sign of wreckage and no debris linked to the plane has ever been picked up despite the most extensive and expensive search effort in aviation history. Authorities have not ruled out mechanical problems as a cause but say the evidence, including the loss of communications, suggests it was deliberately diverted thousands of kilometres from its scheduled route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

A scan of the area around the pings failed to find any sign of wreckage and no debris linked to the plane has ever been picked up despite the most extensive and expensive search effort in aviation history . The US Navy official’s claims come just days after underwater scientists said Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott's announcement that black box pingers had been found was premature and lacked detailed analysis. The acoustic experts, who wished to remain anonymous, said the four critical signals picked up by the pinger locator were almost definitely not from MH370’s black box and agreed they were likely to be from a different man-made source. The experts said the signals were detected too far apart to be from the black box and were also the wrong frequency.

'As soon as I saw the frequency and the distance between the pings I knew it couldn’t be the aircraft pinger,' one of the scientists said. The pings had played a key role in shaping the search for the plane, which vanished on a routine flight as it crossed the South China Sea. Australian authorities have not yet commented on the most recent claims about the pings.","Four acoustic 'pings' were not from black box and could have been from a ship .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Apologetic: Cleveland Smith reportedly apologized for an attempted armed robbery by calling his victim as he was on his way to jail . A Florida man behind bars for an armed home invasion called his victim to apologize just before he was locked up. Cleveland Smith and two other men broke into a Boynton Beach home May 15 and seriously injured homeowner Chris Bates when the Smith pistol-whipped Bates with his own gun, police said. Bates claimed to WPBF the attack forced him to get 11 staples in his head when he visited a local hospital, and he refused to accept Smith’s apology. 'He was like … oh just listen listen, listen, listen, bro I didn't mean to do that, the guys were going to kill me, they had a gun to my back,' Bates told the station. The encounter started when the trio broke into Bates’ home after knocking on his door, police told WPTV. One of the robbers then pulled a gun on bates and demanded entry to his home, cops said. Bates attempted to fight the men off, but Smith grabbed Bates’ gun and smashed him in the side of the head with it, authorities said. The victim told WPBF he did not accept the apology or believe Smith had any remorse for his actions. Bates knows Smith personally, and said the attacker knew he shared the home with his fiancée and two young children. ‘I don't take the apology because my fiancé could've lost his life,' Rutta Aliensy told WPBF. Bates later identified Smith from a photo lineup. The other attackers have yet to be apprehended.","Cleveland Smith was one of three thieves who broke into a Florida home earlier this month .

"By . Lydia Warren . Sick: Ashley Richards, 23, tortured animals for years with high heels, meat cleavers and tools . A 23-year-old woman has been sentenced to 10 years behind bars for torturing dogs and cats to death to make videos for people who found the sick treatment sexually arousing. Ashley Nichole Richards pleaded guilty to three counts of animal cruelty in Houston, Texas, Harris County District Attorney Devon Anderson announced on Thursday morning. She created as many as 27 'crush' videos between February 2010 and August 2012 and was eventually stopped after PETA discovered the footage and alerted the authorities. After her arrest in 2012, prosecutors said she tortured a puppy, kittens, a rabbit, mice, a pigeon, fish, lobsters and . crabs using high heeled shoes, a meat cleaver, . knives, screwdrivers and pliers. A graphic statement from PETA at the time revealed that she had often killed up to two animals a day, including a kitten who was bound with masking tape before being stomped on with a high heel that went into its eye. Another video shows her using a meat cleaver to cut off a puppy's leg, PETA said. Disgusting: Richards can be seen in one of the 'crush' videos that were made for people who found the violence sexually arousing. She tortured kittens, rabbits, dogs and birds, prosecutors said . She allegedly filmed the videos with the help of Brent Justice, 52, who is also charged with animal cruelty. They would then give the videos to people who were sexually aroused by the treatment, prosecutors said, the Houston Chronicle reported. 'When . a person tortures and kills an animal, that raises a red flag about . that person’s capacity for violent behavior in general,' District . Attorney Devon Anderson said, News92 reported. 'It will always be a priority for our . office to aggressively prosecute offenders who abuse animals.' Partner: Brent Justice, 52, has been charged with animal cruelty for allegedly filming her . The case is the first time anyone has been prosecuted for 'crush' videos in Harris County. 'While we are satisfied that the defendant received the maximum penalty in these cases,' Anderson said. 'We will fight at the next legislative session to increase the punishment range for this offense to better protect these animals and all citizens of Harris County.' Stephanie Bell from PETA added: 'Given the undeniable link between cruelty . to animals and interpersonal violence, the community at large is safer . when convicted abusers such as Richards are behind bars.' Some charges in the case were dismissed last year because a federal judge dismissed the statue as overbroad and a violation of their First Amendment rights. Four months later, prosecutors filed an appeal. 'As with child pornography, it is necessary to dry up the market in animal crush videos, which have little if any social value, in order to effectively prevent the criminal acts that necessarily occur when the videos are produced,' prosecutors had claimed, the Houston Press reported last year. Justice is being held in the Harris County jail in . lieu of $50,000 bail.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Aid workers are fighting an outbreak of cholera in South Sudan which has killed 23 people and infected at least 670 and is now threatening to spread rapidly across the war-torn country. So far all the confirmed cases are confined to the capital Juba where tens of thousands of people have sought refuge at UN refugee camps following five-and-a half months of ethnic violence and civil war. But the U.N. believes the disease is spreading with unconfirmed cases reported in other parts of the impoverished country including in Jonglei, Lakes and Upper Nile states. Outbreak: A South Sudanese woman cradles her baby who is suffering from cholera at the Juba Teaching Hospital in South Sudan capital . The often fatal disease is spread though contaminated water and food. Two to five days after infection it causes severe diarrhea as the body is drained of water. To make matters worse the region is currently experiencing unusually heavy rainfall, which has the potential to exacerbate the spread of the disease and is hampering aid efforts. In total some 1.3 million people are believed to have been displaced by the civil war with an estimated 4.9 million in need of urgent humanitarian assistance, according to figures from the Christian Aid Charity. Cholera patients are treated in a tent at the Juba Teaching Hospital in South Sudan. An outbreak of the disease in the war-torn country has killed 23 people and infected at least 670 . Patient: A cholera sufferer lies on a makeshift bed as he waits for treatment at the Juba Teaching Hospital . The U.N. believes the disease is spreading with unconfirmed cases reported in other parts of the impoverished country including in Jonglei, Lakes and Upper Nile states . Cholera is an acute intestinal infection caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It has a short incubation period, from less than one day to five days, and produces an enterotoxin. That causes a copious, painless, watery diarrhoea that can quickly lead to severe dehydration and death if treatment is not promptly given. Vomiting also occurs in most patients. Speaking on Wednesday World Health . Organisation spokesman Abdinasir Abubakar said: 'So far as of yesterday, . we have over 670 cases that have received treatment. Out of that, 23 . people have died from cholera. 'We are still at the early stage of the outbreak'. The UN is working to move displaced people from the cramped conditions of camps in Juba to other sites around the country in a bid to to reduce the risk of an outbreak. Most patients being treated for the disease at the Juba Teaching Hospital were found to have been drinking untreated water from the River Nile supplied by water tankers. Efforts are now underway to chlorinate the water shipment in order to kill off the Cholera bacteria.

South Sudan saw massive violence sweep the country in December, when fighting in the world's newest nation broke out between troops loyal to President Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, and those loyal to his former vice-president Riek Machar, an ethnic Nuer. Kiir fired Machar last July and accused him of trying to oust him in a coup in December, which sparked months of ethnic attacks. An initial cease-fire in January failed. A second cease-fire on May 9 has led to a tense standoff in the country.

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power urged Kiir and Machar to implement the cease-fire agreements without further delay and resolve their dispute. Power said the ethnic violence and absence of 'a credible peace agreement' required the council to 'prioritize the safety and well-being of the South Sudanese people first and foremost' and end the U.N. mission's 'direct support to the government.'","At least 670 confirmed cases of the disease reported in the capital Juba .

"By . Mark Prigg . Health sensors and devices can get better if rival companies work together, Samsung has claimed as it revealed a new smart wristband. The Korean giant revealed a plan to allow manufacturers to use the same core components - much like the mobile phone market. It also revealed an online service to track the data - just days before Apple is expected to reveal its 'Healthbook' app for the iPhone. Last night, Samsung revealed a new smart wristband and announced plans to let manufacturers use the same core components - much like the mobile phone market. Ram Fish, Vice President of Digital Health for Samsung is pictured displaying the Simband . Although a full set of features has not been released, Samsung said the gadget would read: . heart rate . blood flow . respiration . galvanic skin response . hydration . gas and glucose concentrations blood . substances carried in the surrounding air . 'There is a tremendous opportunity at the intersection of health and technology,' said Young Sohn, president and chief strategy officer for Samsung Electronics’ Device Solutions. 'This is the single greatest opportunity of our generation. 'This is a big enough challenge—we cannot do it alone, we have to do it with partners.' Samsung expects to make 'beta' test versions of its Simband wristband and SAMI data service later this year. It has been partnering with scientists from the University of California, San Francisco and other institutions to test its devices and offer suggestions. The system would also include ways to exchange and analyze data. Samsung believes that could help detect heart problems and other medical conditions sooner. Third-party app developers could also tap that data, with a user's permission, to recommend exercise and diets, for instance. Samsung presented its vision for wearable devices at a San Francisco event ahead of next week's developers conference by rival Apple. There is widespread speculation that Apple has been working on wearable devices, and its products tend to use proprietary technologies. However, an open system would be a departure for Samsung as well. Its Gear wristwatches and fitness devices currently work only with Samsung phones. Smartwatches from Sony and other manufacturers tend to work with a wider range of Android phones. The Simband sensor module is packed with sensors, and Samsung hopes other manufacturers with use the same components . Young Sohn, Samsung's president and chief strategy officer, described the Gear devices as a second-generation product. The first generation consisted of fitness-tracking apps downloaded on smartphones. Future devices, he said, would be able to collect more vital signs and send you to a doctor before you get symptoms. Set to be called Healthbook  the app is expected to be included in a new version of Apple's iOS software that will launch alongside its health-tracking wristband. He compared them to cars embedded with sensors to warn you of low air pressure and other troubles. Samsung is also trying to improve usability by allowing users to recharge the Simband while wearing it. With current devices, users typically have to remove their devices for recharging every few days.","Simband wristband an online service set to launch this year .

Hannah Connaway of Wilmington, North Carolina, was so badly beaten on Friday night that she had to undergo emergency brain surgery and was put in a medically-induced coma. Her boyfriend, Michael Hutton appeared in court on Tuesday and has been charged with attempted first-degree murder, kidnapping and drug charges. Scroll down for video . Hannah Connaway of Wilmington, North Carolina, was so badly beaten on Friday night that she had to undergo emergency brain surgery and was put in a medically-induced coma . According to the assistant district attorney, the couple got into an argument over some texts while at Hutton's parent's house. His parents were out of town, reports WECT6. Also present was Connaway's friend, Claudene Williams, who said Hutton was angry because of some tangled fishing lines. ‘He was angry because he couldn't untangle fishing lines,’ explained Williams. ‘He was blaming her (Hannah) for some things like having snarky remarks to things he was saying, and then it just escalated and kept on going.’ Michael Hutton appeared in court on Tuesday and has been charged with attempted first-degree murder, kidnapping and drug charges . The fight started inside the home and ended in the front yard. Williams said Hutton had beaten, strangled, and dragged Connaway across the yard. ‘I keep on hearing her screaming and I keep on hearing all the sounds and it's just awful. I ran around the front door. I tried to get in. All the doors were locked. It was just awful,’ Williams said. When emergency responders arrived on scene they found Connaway unconscious in the front yard. ‘She's bleeding and on the ground. She can't walk,’ a caller told a 911 operator late Friday night. ‘It's her boyfriend, and he's threatening and screaming at us to get back in the car, so I just need someone to be there.’ Connaway was immediately taken to New Hanover Regional Medical Center for emergency brain surgery. Hutton was originally arrested on Saturday night for assault to inflict serious injury and assault on a female charges, but bonded out on Monday. Connaway had updated her Facebook status on March 15 to announce that she was in a relationship with Hutton . He was taken back into custody following Tuesday’s court appearance.

"By . Chris Pleasance . Shelly Sterling is reviewing five bids for the LA Clippers which could see the team sell for up to $2billion, it has been claimed. Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, Oprah Winfrey, former Clippers player Grant Hill and Steve Jobs' widow Laurene are all reported to be in the running . Shelly, wife of disgraced Clippers' owner Donald Sterling, is racing to offload the team before the NBA votes to force a sale on Tuesday next week, meaning the couple would get less favourable terms. Shelly Sterling (left) is thought to be examining five offers for the LA Clippers. She is trying to offload the sports franchise before next Tuesday when the NBA will vote to strip husband Donald (right) of ownership . A source close to the bidding process said the sale price 'appears to be . increasing to an unbelievable number,' adding that it could soar past the expected $1.5billion . to $2 billion, and possibly more. The deal is set to smash league records for the most expensive NBA franchise ever sold, beating the $550million paid for the Milwaukee Bucks earlier this month. Another person familiar with the negotiations said Shelly Sterling's attorneys, bankers and others involved in the process were in a locked room reviewing the bids, which were due by 2 p.m. PDT Wednesday. According to the LA Times, Steve Ballmer, thought to be worth $20billion, is leading one bid, with another group including basketball star Grant Hill, Bruce Karsh, minority owner of the NBA’s Golden State Warriors, and Tony Ressler, minority owner of baseball’s Milwaukee Brewers. A third group includes Oracle software co-founder Larry Ellison, entertainment magnate David Geffen and Oprah Winfrey. According to ESPN that group has now added Chicago-based Guggenheim Partners - who had previously partnered with Magic Johnson - Steve Jobs widow Laurene Jobs, Steve Wynn ex-wife Elaine Wynn, and Beats by Dre co-founder Jimmy Iovine. A fourth offer is expected to come from bidders backed by Middle Eastern investors, though less is known about this group. Potential buyers are thought to be offering up to 80 per cent of their bid in cash in order to simplify the deal, while another source suggested they are also being asked for deposits of £300million. However, Donald Sterling's attorney Bobby Samini, has caused some confusion by saying there would be no sale of the team without Donald Sterling's involvement. Donald was fined $2.5million and banned from the NBA after he was recorded making racist comments . It was reported that Shelly was authorised to sell 100 per cent of the franchise on behalf of her husband. A letter dated May 22, written by one of Sterling's attorneys and signed by him stated: 'Donald T. Sterling authorizes Rochelle . Sterling to negotiate with the National Basketball Association regarding . all issues in connection with a sale of the Los Angeles Clippers team.' However, the latest comment has raised fears that Donald is simply using the bidding process to establish a value for the team, before suing the NBA for that amount in damages if they force him to sell. NBA spokesman Mike Bass said the league's advisory/finance committee met Wednesday by phone to discuss the separate responses from Donald and Shelly Sterling to the NBA on its efforts to end the Sterlings' ownership of the Clippers. An source close to the NBA said that the league's owners know a sale couldn't be completed by next Tuesday, but if an agreement was in place, the NBA would give the Sterlings extra time before holding any meetings. The individual said the league hopes a voluntary sale would remove the potential of legal action being taken by the Sterlings. They added that at this point, with Donald Sterling saying he plans to fight the matter in court, the NBA intends to go forward with the meeting in New York on June 3. A forced sale would require approval by three-fourths of the league's 30 owners. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has said he is confident he would get the necessary votes. On Tuesday, Donald Sterling issued a fiery response to the league's attempt to oust him. Steve Ballmer, former Microsoft CEO thought to be worth $20billion, is thought to be leading one bid . Another group includes Oracle software CEO Larry Ellison (left) and entertainment magnate David Geffen (right) The league is accusing him of damaging it and its merchandising partners with his racist comments released in a recording released last month. Donald argued that there is no basis for stripping him of his team because his statements were illegally recorded 'during an inflamed lovers' quarrel in which he was clearly distraught.' According to the response, Sterling says girlfriend V. Stiviano recorded him without his knowledge, which is illegal under California law. He also said he could not have 'willfully' damaged the league because he did not know it would be made public. 'We do not believe a court in the United States of America will enforce the draconian penalties imposed on Mr. Sterling in these circumstances, and indeed, we believe that preservation of Mr. Sterling's constitutional rights requires that these sham proceedings be terminated in Mr. Sterling's favor,' the response said. Donald Sterling was banned for life and fined $2.5 million by NBA commissioner Adam Silver after the recording was made public. It is possible Shelly Sterling could complete an expedited sale of the team despite her husband's legal wranglings, according to Daniel Lazaroff, director of the Sports Law Institute at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. He said: 'She would have to be willing to go through with a sale that gave her absolutely no retained ownership interest in order to satisfy the league. 'If she did that, I don't think the league would stand in her way. If she wants to retain any portion of ownership it wouldn't work.' Even if Shelly Sterling accepts an offer, the league has the right to approve potential owners, a lengthy process that would almost certainly not be completed by next Tuesday. 'The best case scenario is she finds a suitable buyer,' Lazaroff said. That would work for the league and from a financial standpoint that would work for the Sterlings. 'If the sale price is satisfactory, the smart thing might be to just get out. He's a businessman who understands buy low and sell high.' Donald Sterling purchased the Clippers for $12 million in 1981, making him the league's longest-tenured owner. Lazaroff noted that Sterling signed the NBA's constitution when he joined the league, and its bylaws spell out specific procedures for terminating ownership. He said as long as the league follows its own rules it should be on solid legal ground. 'I could see a happy ending to this,' Lazaroff added, 'but it will depend on both of the Sterlings being out of the picture.'","Shelly Sterling is thought to be considering five bids for LA Clippers .

"By . Michael Zennie . A Philadelphia community college was thrown into chaos and had to be evacuated on Wednesday after a student pulled a gun on a classmate - and police have revealed it was all because of a fight over a woman. Authorities arrested Ryan Fitch, 23, on the campus of the Community College of Philadelphia after he allegedly threatened a classmate for a comment he made about Fitch's girlfriend. The weapon caused panic in the chemistry classroom - that spread to students across the campus.

Two buildings were evacuated and nearby schools were placed on lock down while police searched for Fitch. 'It was chaos!' student Elisha Buckingham told WCAU-TV. Buckingham said she and her classmates locked the door to their classroom and pushed the desks against the door to barricade themselves inside. Many students feared an active shooter scenario and were especially on alert after last week's rampage near the University of California at Santa Barbara. She and others at the community college are furious that administrators waited 19 minutes to send out an emergency alert - after many of them had heard about the incident from social media and news reports. The incident was reportedly over this woman, Fitch's girlfriend. She refused to speak to the media . 'Any moment, a student or a staff member could have walked into a situation and had no clue what they were getting themselves into. 'Even though people on the outside knew, but we didn't want we were in the situation.' Fitch's step-mother told WCAU she is shocked by the allegations and called Fitch 'a good guy.' Fitch was licensed to carry the gun, but the Community College of Philadelphia bans weapons on their campus - making the weapon illegal to even possess.","Ryan Fitch allegedly pulled out a gun in a chemistry class at the Community College of Philadelphia .

"By . Chris Pleasance . As far as adrenaline kicks go, you might have thought paragliding up to 2,500ft before plunging through the air at 125mph would be enough for even the most adventurous thrill-seeker. But not for daredevil Sebastian Alvarez who decided to up the ante by using his wingsuit to fly between two residential tower-blocks in Chile which are just 40ft apart. Despite completing 800 jumps in the past, even adrenaline junkie Alvarez admitted he was nervous before his latest stunt. Scroll down for videos . Daredevil Sebastian Alvarez has filmed himself flying between two tower blocks in his hometown in Chile . The adrenaline junkie paraglided up to 2,500ft before plunging between the buildings at more than 125mph . The residential flat blocks are located in Alvarez' home town of Renaca, a city in central Chile . 'I'm always fearful but I don't let that emotion overwhelm me,' Alvarez said. 'I felt focused in the air, not distracted by anything else. 'I felt a huge sense of accomplishment and relief after the jump. I was just so happy it all went as planned and grateful for everyone's help.' After passing between the building in his hometown of Renaca, Chile, Alvarez deployed a parachute on the back of his Vampire 2 Wingsuit before floating down to Earth. Alvarez (right) has completed more than 800 jumps before, but admitted he was nervous beforehand . A friend flew ALvarez up to 2,500ft on a paraglider before he jumped off, using his Wingsuit to steer . Alvarez has developed a reputation for Wingsuit proximity flying - essentially travelling through small gaps while flying at tremendous speed using one of the suits. In another of his videos on YouTube, Alvarez captured the moment he flew down a narrow cliff trench in Walenstadt, Switzerland. His motto, posted on his Facebook page, is: 'Push it hard, know your limits, be crazy as hell, respect experience, . enjoy your friends, fall in love, keep nature and FLYFAST!!' Alvarez then shot between the buildings, which are just 40ft apart, at almost 125miles an hour (pictrued: the view from the back of Alvarez' helmet) After the stunt was over, Alvarez opened the parachute on his Vampire 2 Wingsuit and floated to Earth .","Sebastian Alvarez flew at 125mph between buildings just 40ft apart .

"By . Julian Robinson . With their shields locked together and advancing forward slowly, Chinese riot police appear to be taking tips from Roman times in their latest training drills . Like a legion of Roman soldiers in perfect tortoise formation, they hold their defensive line leaving barely a gap between their shields to protect their heads and bodies from flying objects. It is one of the techniques guards in Beijing are planning to use should they be called into action when China marks the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown. Adopting a technique similar to the Roman 'testudo' formation, groups of Chinese police protect their heads and bodies with shields during a series of training drills . Flash point: Beijing police officers, including the elite Snow Leopard Commando Unit, practice their skills ahead of the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown . Advancing: With their shields close together, scores of Chinese police march forward while water cannons are deployed behind them during training drills in Beijing . The Snow Leopard unit were testing out their weapons against baying crowds, including multi-coloured spray . The training drill bears a striking resemblance to the ‘testudo’ formation used by groups of Roman centurions where men would align their shields to protect them from flying arrows from the front, top, side and back. Their training also comes following a series of separatist attacks across the nation. Just a week ago attackers hurled bombs from two SUVs that plowed through shoppers at a busy street market in China's volatile northwestern region of Xinjiang, killing 31 people and wounding more than 90. Elite officers abseil down the side of a building as explosions are set off on the ground in another drill designed to prepare forces for terrorist attacks and hijackings . In this training drill, police surround and storm onto a bus. The training comes following a string of separatist attacks around China recently . A soldier practices his close quarters combat skills, top right, while another man brandishes an imitation machete in a mock-up of a terrorist attack . The early morning attack in the city of Urumqi was the bloodiest in a series of violent incidents over recent months that Chinese authorities have blamed on radical separatists from the country's Muslim Uighur minority . Police officers in Beijing, including China’s elite Snow Leopard Commando Unit, have since been seen showing off their skills at handling terrorist attacks, hijackings and large-scale protests. The drills come ahead of the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square tragedy in which pro-democracy demonstrations turned to bloodshed. Stand-off: Police stand guard as they run through what might happen in the event of a confrontation on the upcoming anniversary of the Tiananmen Square tragedy . Moving in: Three Chinese soldiers are put through their paces in another training drill in Beijing . Smoke fills the air as riot police advance in another drill designed at sharpening their skills should they be called to deal with confrontations in the run up to the Tiananmen Square anniversary . China has never confirmed the number killed during the military crackdown, although independent observers believe it could have been more than 1,000 dead in Beijing, with further victims elsewhere. The Chinese Communist Party branded the Tiananmen protests a 'counter-revolutionary rebellion' Every year, the government attempts to prevent any commemorations or public discussions of the anniversary of the June 4, 1989, crackdown, but activists say this year has been one of the most severe clampdowns.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A five-year-old girl who suffocated at her Texas kindergarten in December last year had choked to death on a pin she swallowed. Teachers and staff at Corbell Elementary School had tried frantically to save Meaghan Levy's life, but they were unable to revive her. An autopsy has showed that the little girl from Frisco died because her airway was blocked by a pushpin. Grieving: Meaghan's mom Nicole, right, and aunt Erika Kennedy, left, are still mourning the loss of the little girl who choked on a pin . Unexpected: Meaghan was a healthy five-year-old, but she died at her school after choking on a pin . Meaghan's family and teachers had been at a loss to explain how the healthy and cheerful child had suddenly become ill and died on December 12 last year. Her class had been in the school library when Meaghan approached a teacher with her hands clutched around her neck. The teacher quickly took her to the nurse's office, but Meaghan collapsed in the school hallway before they could get there. Once she had been carried inside, an oxygen tank the nurse used to try to revive her allegedly malfunctioned, spraying a caustic chemical over the nurse who had to be taken to hospital, according to the Dallas Observer. 'We were praying; we were talking to her, whispering in her ear, and just begging her to hold on,' Meaghan's aunt, Erika Kennedy said. Tributes: Corbell Elementary School decorated the campus with pink ribbons in memory of Meaghan . 'When you . have so many questions, and so many unanswered questions, it makes it . that much harder ... we can’t even begin to grieve,' she told WFAA. When . doctors examined X-Rays of Meaghan they suggested that a pin seen in . her airway could have been the cause of death, but it has only just been . confirmed by the medical examiner's office. The death was later ruled an accident. 'When we heard it was a pushpin, that . really rocked everybody, because it hit home that it could have happened . to anybody's child,' Dawn Neufeld, whose daughter went to school with Meaghan, said. 'It was so hard on all of them. I have no doubt that every single person at the school did . everything in their power to help Meaghan that day,' she told Kens5. Shortly after Meaghan's death her school held a 'pink out' where the campus was decorated with pink ribbons and classmates wore pink in memory of the little girl. However, family spokesman Daryl Kevin Washington said they believe if the oxygen tank had worked, Meaghan could have been saved. 'We know and we believe that would have played an important role in saving Meaghan's life,' he said. Meaghan's family hope the little girl's death will bring changes to the school, including a ban on pushpins, CPR training for all teachers, and better checks to ensure medical equipment is working.","Teachers tried to save Meaghan Levy as she suffocated in hallway .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Rory McIlroy dumped Caroline Wozniacki in a three-minute phone call hours after telling her he loved her, reports claim. The Northern Irish golfer and his 23-year-old fiancée were due to wed in November. But McIlroy, 25, is said to have ended their three-year relationship in 180 seconds because he was not prepared for 'all that marriage entails'. Scroll down for video . Rory McIlroy, 25, reportedly broke up with Caroline Wozniacki, 23, in a call. On Sunday, the Northern Irish golfer won the BMW PGA Championship (left) but yesterday his ex-fiancée crashed out of the French Open (right) Engaged: The couple had been together for three years and were due to marry in November . Wozniacki, who crashed out of the French Open on Tuesday, dispelled any suggestions that the break-up was ‘mutual’ at a press conference after the match. 'Obviously you’re not prepared for something like this, and it came as a bit of a shock,' the Dane said. Her words came a day after McIlroy won won the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth, Surrey, in what commentators described as an 'absolute masterclass' and 'incredible stuff'. According to The Times's Neil Harman, she had no idea their relationship was troubled when McIlroy flew from their apartment in Monaco to play in Surrey. But a day later, he called to say he couldn't go through with the wedding, Harman writes. Wozniacki had reportedly already tried on her wedding dress. The pair, pictured in Sloane Square on May 15, were 'together in their apartment a day before his call' 'The problem is mine,' he said. 'The wedding invitations issued at the weekend made me realise that I wasn't ready. 'I wish Caroline all the happiness she deserves and thank her for the great times we've had. Everyone has been through break-ups and it's obviously very, very difficult.' At Wentworth, McIlroy responded by scoring an impressive 14-under total of 274 at the European Tour's flagship event, beating 16 golfers in the top 50 of the world rankings. Wozniacki lost her match 7-6, 4-6, 6-2 to Belgian player Yanina Wickmayer.

"By . Julian Robinson . A wargamer dressed as a soldier and carrying a fake gun nearly died when he strolled into a packed subway station in a country on high alert after a series of public killings. Ming Shao, who was off to join friends playing survivalist games in Taiwan, said he couldn't be bothered to pack his uniform and imitation weapon. So the 29-year-old walked on to the underground train in the city of Taipei in Taiwan in south-eastern China in his military-style outfit sparking fears he was a gunman about to open fire. He even had a helmet fitted with night vision. Ming Shao, pictured on a train in his military outfit and carrying a fake gun, was on his way to play wargames with friends when armed police were called in . Ming Shao was carrying a fake gun and imitation hand grenades at the subway station in Taipei. Just a week earlier a man had gone on a killing spree at the same station . The incident came just a week after a man went on a stabbing spree at the same station, killing three people. 'This man doesn't realise how close he came to losing his life,' said an officer called to assist in the latest incident. 'Armed specialists were poised to open fire and ask questions later. If he had twitched or looked the wrong way he would have been dead because our priority was to protect the innocent civilians on that train.' According to the man he was on his way to a wargaming afternoon with friends and later told police: 'I didn't mean any harm.' Officers eventually let him off with a caution - and told him to go home and change. Ming Shao, pictured left as he was stopped by armed police, and right, carrying his luggage near the station, later told police he 'did not mean any harm' by wearing the soldier outfit . China has experienced a number of attacks on innocent people in public places in recent times, making the population fearful when they see strangers behaving unusually. Last week at the same station in Taipei a man went on a stabbing spree aboard a subway train, killing three people and wounding 25 others in the worst such incident on the island. Cheng Chieh, a 21-year-old college student, was immediately arrested after the incident, the first fatal attack on the city’s subway system since it began operating in 1996. Three people died during the attack and a fourth victim, a 62-year-old woman, died later in hospital. The other three victims were a woman and two men. After ordering him to lie flat on the floor, police let Ming Shao off with a caution - and told him to go home and change . The police swoop, pictured, came a week after a man went on a stabbing spree aboard a subway train at the same station, killing three people and wounding 25 others . Cheng spoke of his motives during police questioning. 'He told the police that he had wanted to do a ‘big thing’ such as this since his childhood,' Chen Kuo-en, chief of the New Taipei City police bureau, told reporters. 'He said he had planned to do this after his graduation, but last week decided to act ahead of his schedule,' the police chief said, adding that the attacker had no medical record of mental disorder. The student bought two knives, including a 30-centimetre-long knife and a smaller one at a supermarket in Taipei in preparation for the attack. After being alerted to the attacks, authorities immediately reinforced police deployment on the busy subway system, which transports around 1.85 million visitors per day.","Ming Shao wore outfit on his way to play 'survivalist games' in Tapei, Taiwan .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Her sculptures may be wooden, but artist Stefanie Rocknak's creations are anything but lifeless as these beautifully detailed pictures show. From a cyclist with veins standing out on his arms, to a face contorted in fear, Rocknak, who is also a professor of philosophy, hand carves each figure when she is not busy in the classroom. While a basic design can take just a few days to complete, more detailed work can take anything up to a month and a half to finish. Sculptor Stephanie Rocknak takes anywhere between a few days and a month and a half to create wonderfully detailed wooden designs such as this one, called The King . Made from two pieces of basswood, one for the body, head and crown, and another for the hands, The King was displayed in the windows of Saks on 5th Avenue, New York . The figure, which was completed in February 2008, was inspired by exhibits in the National Portrait Gallery in London, and the National War Museum in Warsaw, Poland . This piece, The Queen, was finished in August 2010 and designed as a counterpart to The King. The figure is also made from basswood, and her crown is made from many pieces slotted together . Her work has been exhibited all over the world, and a statue of Edgar Allan Poe she designed will take pride of place in Edgar Allan Square in Boston after it is unveiled in October. The brass figure beat 265 other entries from 42 and 13 countries to win the commission, and is designed to look as if Poe has just stepped off the train to visit his parents. Her sculptures have also been displayed in the Smithsonian, the windows of Sak's on 5th avenue, and in the Mariner’s Museum, on the Hudson River Sloop. Rocknak can spend up to 1,000 hours getting the details of a sculpture just right, such as the delicate floral designs which run down The Queen's sleeves and the garlands around her neck . The Biker sculpture was created from two pieces of wood in 2005 and was one piece in a three-part commission called The Triathlete, which included a runner and a swimmer . The arms on the rider show the level of detail that goes into Rocknak's work, with his veins, sinewy muscle and wristwatch all painstakingly carved out . Rocknak was artistic from a young age, . training as a painter, before travelling to Rome in 1987 where she was . inspired by the likes of Michelangelo, Dontatello and Bernini and turned . to sculpture instead. While she intended to become a stone sculptor, she started working in wood first as her mother used to refurbish wood furniture, her father was a carpenter, and her grandfather had a wood shop in his ship yard. She always intended to start using stone, but fell in love 'the warmth and unpredictability of the wood,' and never went back. The Swimmer was part of the same commission. Speaking about the work, Rocknak said she was interested in capturing people in motion, as she found posed characters uninteresting . The Swimmer was carved from a single piece of wood and formed part of a three-part collection, which included The Rider. The third part, The Runner, was a huge runner's leg, also made from basswood . Rocknak says her art is deliberately simple to understand, and aims to be visually rich and detailed rather than intellectually complex or conceptual . Steering . away from modern 'conceptual' art which Rocknak says is often . overly-complex, she aims to create figures which are 'immediate and . obvious; ideally, they do not need a theory to do their talking.' One . of her commissions, The Triathlete, featured three figures including a . bike rider, a swimmer and a giant runner's leg to represent the three . stages of a race. At . the time she was creating the work, Rocknak said she preferred creating . figures in motion as she found 'posed' figures uninteresting. Rocknak says she was inspired by stone masters such a Michelangelo and Donatello but chose to work in wood as her father was a carpenter and her mother used to repair wooden furniture . Rocknak also uses her talents to capture human emotions in wooden sculptures. This piece is simply called Terrified and captures a wide-eyed woman with her head thrown back in fear . This work, called Ghastly Nights, captures a woman's fear and frustration which keep her awake .","Stefanie Rocknak is professor of philosophy at a New York college .
