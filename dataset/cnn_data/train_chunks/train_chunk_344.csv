"(CNN) -- The iconic home of Vito Corleone from the 1972 classic ""The Godfather"" is for sale on Staten Island, New York. While broker Connie Profaci said none of the movie's scenes were shot inside the home, its sprawling 24,000 square foot property was the setting for the Mafia epic's opening, one of its most memorable scenes: As his daughter's wedding reception took place out in the yard, Don Vito -- played by Marlon Brando -- held court inside with his capos and fielded requests from wedding guests looking to have someone whacked or strong-armed. The five-bedroom English Tudor, which has changed hands only once since the movie's filming, ""was gut renovated in 2012,"" by its current owner, according to Profaci, and now it contains such modern amenities as a ""man cave,"" a gym, and even an English Pub. The yard, where the movie's mob patriarch later died, now features a saltwater pool. If you want to make an offer that Profaci won't refuse, be prepared to pony up: She's listed the house for $2,895,000.","The Staten Island home where scenes from ""The Godfather"" were filmed is for sale .

"(CNN) -- ""The Simpsons"" co-creator Sam Simon is facing terminal illness the best way he knows how: with a sense of humor and a generous heart. It was two years ago that Simon, 59, was told that he had colon cancer and had just three to six months to live. ""They showed me my scans and said, these are the scans of a dead man,"" Simon recalled in an interview with NBC's Maria Shriver. ""I said, 'Is it curable?' And the doctor goes, 'We don't use that word.' "" Though his doctor couldn't cure him, he could work to keep Simon alive. ""And he's done a remarkable job of it,"" Simon said. ""I feel great. I've never been happier."" Some of that happiness comes from being ""surrounded by people that love me and take care of me and would do anything for me,"" Simon said. ""That's called happiness."" But part of his peace comes from his philanthropy. When Simon learned of his diagnosis, he made a promise to give away his fortune. He never did say how much he's made over his many years in Hollywood, working on ""The Simpsons"" in addition to hits like ""Taxi"" and ""Cheers."" But what is clear is that however much he has, he wants it to go toward animal welfare and to feed the hungry. ""Ingrid Newkirk, who is the founder of PETA and one of the most influential people in my life ... she came up with an almost therapy for me, where we planned and are still planning a series of animal liberations and actions that I get to participate in and enjoy and have something to look forward to at the same time,"" Simon said. There's also his philanthropic organization, the Sam Simon Foundation, which aids animals and has a ""feeding families program that feeds 400 families a day in Los Angeles."" His passion for these causes comes from a responsibility he feels, Simon explained, ""to speak for those who can't speak for themselves."" Simon was honest about how difficult his diagnosis has been -- ""cancer is a horrible disease, (and) I am struggling with it,"" he told Shriver -- but he added that it's also been a lesson. ""It has been a fight; it's been an adventure; it's been an education,"" Simon said. ""It's been the most amazing experience of my life.""","""The Simpsons"" co-creator was told he had three to six months to live .

"(CNN) -- After more than two years of hints and leaks, the long-awaited Amazon phone appears to be almost ready for its debut. The device has been a prime example of ""vaporware,"" the term for rumored tech gadgets that everybody loves talking about despite the fact they don't officially exist. And Amazon has never confirmed that it's making a smartphone. But the drumbeat is getting louder, and recent reports suggest the handset will hit the market soon. In the past week, tech blog Boy Genius Report has posted images of what it says is that very phone, along with a report that users will control some features of the device just by tilting it at certain angles. That followed a report from The Wall Street Journal that Amazon will roll out the phone by June and it will be on sale by September. Both articles say the phone will include a groundbreaking technology: a screen that uses four cameras to produce hologram-like 3-D images without the need for special glasses. In the BGR photos, the phone is cloaked in a protective shell that hides details of its design. The blog did not say how it acquired those images, but reported speaking with ""multiple trusted sources."" In the past, BGR has accurately reported details about unannounced Amazon products like its Kindle Fire tablets and Kindle e-readers. The 3-D model is one of two phones Amazon plans to announce, the reports say, the other being a cheaper, less fancy one. The company that made its name in online retailing has been working on the phone for several years, according to reports. And, indeed, rumors of its existence have been floating around since at least 2011. Amazon was long thought of primarily as a website. But since the success of its e-reader, the Kindle, the company has increasingly become known for its hardware, too. The original Kindle in 2007 was followed by the Kindle Fire tablet and, most recently, by Amazon Fire TV, a device that streams Web content to your television. With the Fire TV, Amazon has reaffirmed its products as competitors to similar hardware from Apple and Google, as well as more targeted companies like Roku and TiVo. It makes sense that a phone would follow. And Amazon appears to have chosen to take its time to roll out something unique instead of just jumping into a crowded market dominated by the iPhone and a small handful of handsets running Google's Android operating system. ""Congratulations to Amazon.com for thinking outside the box. If this is a hit it could be great news for both Amazon.com and their customers,"" wireless analyst Jeff Kagan said. ""It could be another Kindle-like business."" But that success isn't guaranteed, even with Amazon's expansive resources behind it, he said in a media release. ""Some companies like Apple, Google and Samsung are very successful in the smartphone space. However many more companies are trying with very little success,"" Kagan added. ""The next biggest player is Microsoft Nokia and they only have a few percent market share.""","Multiple reports suggest a new smartphone from Amazon is coming soon .

"(CNN) -- A 15-year-old Connecticut boy who shot and killed himself last week with the family shotgun had sustained years of bullying, friends said Monday. Bart Palosz committed suicide August 27 after attending the first day of his sophomore year at Greenwich High School in Greenwich, Connecticut. Friends who knew Bart, a Polish immigrant, told CNN he was the target of bullies due to his size -- the teen was 6 feet, 3 inches tall -- and Polish accent. The friends described him as ""a little awkward in his body"" but said he was a ""giant sweetheart"" who related more with adults than his peers. Lisa Johnson's 13-year-old son Izzy was good friends with Bart and the Palosz family. She gave one of several eulogies at his funeral Friday, saying, ""Bart was one of the kindest kids I had ever met. ... It was a life-changing friendship for Izzy. Bart was two years older, and he was so kind, funny, and refreshingly different from any kid Izzy had ever been around. Our family is absolutely devastated by the loss of Bart in our lives."" ""He's always been a quirky kid...really sweet but really awkward. And that's also why he and Izzy clicked so well. Even though they were different, they were similar in their manner. They were a little outside of the lines,"" Johnson said. Facebook may face prosecution over bullied teenager's suicide in Italy . Johnson confirmed to CNN that Bart had indeed been bullied for years and said that his family had done everything they could to inform the school district of the situation. Kim Eves, communications director for the Greenwich School District, said the district is ""looking at the entire history in his experiences in our school that is an ongoing investigation."" ""He was a very quiet kid -- truly one of the nicest people I ever met in my life. I never once heard him say anything bad about anybody else. He was just kind of a really kindhearted person,"" said Nick Sages, 17, a senior at Palosz's school who knew him through Boy Scouts. Johnson said that Bart did not publicly exhibit any signs of a child in trouble. But after Bart's suicide, several posts came to light on Palosz's social network site on Google Plus that appear to reveal his internal struggles. ""Hey if I were to stab my eye out due to school caused insanity, who would miss me?"" he posted in June alongside a photo of himself with a knife next to his eye. Another post in June appeared to indicate he had attempted suicide by ingesting lighter fluid. Japan: Family and nation grapple with teen bullies . The following month he posted, ""I notice if I sound sad I'm normal and if I act happy, cheerful, and 'normal' there is a high chance that I will try to poison myself, cut myself, commit suicide, or jump in front of a truck :)"" A group of Palosz's classmates have formed a group using social media to provide peer-to-peer support anonymously for students struggling with bullying and other issues. ""Within the school students want to talk to other people who want to listen ... Greenwich High School administration has great staff and they have great social workers, but some people can't reach out to adults themselves but they can reach out to a fellow student who wants to help out,"" said Elias Frank, senior class vice president and one of the founders of the Facebook group encouraging students to offer each other support. A preliminary investigation by the Greenwich Police Department found that the gun Bart used to kill himself was family owned and had been stored inside a gun locker in the home. ""The incident continues to be investigated by members of the Greenwich Police Detective Division,"" a police statement said, declining to provide further information.

"(CNN) -- Days ahead of the one-year anniversary of the rollout of HealthCare.gov, the Affordable Care Act's health care exchange website that was originally plagued with numerous technical glitches, the Department of Health and Human Services has released a report highlighting the impact of the law on hospital costs. HHS, which oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the report projects hospitals will save $5.7 billion in uncompensated care costs in 2014. Uncompensated care costs are those incurred by the hospitals that won't be reimbursed. The report says $4.2 billion of the savings come from the 27 states -- plus Washington, D.C. -- that implemented a Medicaid expansion as part of the health care act, with the additional $1.5 billion in savings spread across the states that opted out of the expansion. ""Hospitals have long been on the front lines of caring for the uninsured, who often cannot pay the full cost of their care. Today's news is good for families, businesses and taxpayers alike,"" said HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell before the report's release. The number of hospital visits by patients who are uninsured has fallen, the report found, and the general hypothesis is that because of the increase in individuals with health care insurance, the instances of uninsured hospital trips are less frequent, and that will continue to be a trend. Study: Obamacare gave 10 million Americans health insurance . However, the report noted that ""the extent of this reduction is an empirical question,"" because there are a number of factors that will contribute to these costs, including ""the extent to which newly insured individuals are able to meet the cost-sharing obligations imposed by their plans."" Asked if these figures might encourage governors of states that originally opted against the expansion to revisit the option, Burwell said the issue was a very individualized one. ""The medicaid issue is retail,"" she told reporters at a briefing on Wednesday. ""It is state by state."" But the issue is also political. Of the 21 states that are not implementing the expansion, all but two of them -- Missouri and Virginia -- have Republican governors. CNN poll: Is Obamacare working? Burwell expressed cautious optimism that the recent decision by Republican Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett to move forward with the Medicaid expansion could influence other GOP governors. ""I think it's true that people are influenced by people who are like them"" she said in response to a question about whether Corbett's decision might inspire others. ""I think the more that we are able to attract conservative Republican governors, the more that those who have very strong feelings will perhaps listen."" According to numbers provided by HHS, a little over 10 million previously uninsured adults have gotten health care coverage since enrollment began last year.

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of homes have been destroyed or damaged by dozens of major bush fires raging in eastern Australia, fire officials said. And they fear that it could get much worse. At least 56 unrelenting blazes have scorched more than 109,000 hectares (269,000 acres), said Matt Sun, spokesman for the New South Wales Rural Fire Service. Twelve of the fires are out of control, officials said. ""We're coming out of a very dry winter, we haven't had a lot of rain for many months,"" said Joel Kursawe, another fire service spokesman. ""That's what obviously very concerning for us because we are still only in spring and we are seeing fires like this with so much destruction."" Among those still facing severe threats are Springwood and Winmalee in the Blue Mountains region, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) west of Sydney. Alex Chesser, a spokesman for the Rural Fire Service, said there is the potential for three fires in that region to join, posing potential hazards to thousands of residents in nearby suburbs. Volunteer firefighter Michael Green, who made a harrowing drive through the fire lines to his home in the mountain town of Dargan, said he and his wife could feel the intense heat through their windows. The fire had passed, but burned trees were still glowing red and the hot spots ""were still quite severe,"" he said. ""It was a bit risky, but I had to get home to see if the house was all right, and the dog,"" Green said. They were. ""It's just a lucky wind change,"" said Green, who shot video of his dash through the burned-out countryside on Thursday. ""The winds were blowing right up, and at the last minute, they changed into a southerly, which took it away from the actual house."" Dozens of firefighters were battling the Linksview Road fire in Springwood early Monday. Conditions are predicted to deteriorate over the next few days, the state fire service said, and blazes might prompt road closures. Under such conditions, fires can be difficult to control, the service said. Embers may be blown ahead, creating spot fires. ""We'll be watching the weather closely over the next three days,"" Chesser said. The Springwood fire destroyed at least 193 homes and damaged another 109, officials said. In the Mount Victoria fire, seven homes have been destroyed and one damaged. Both fires were sparked by power lines that had been buffeted by strong winds. Causes of the other fires are unclear, preliminary investigations showed. Officials are looking into whether a blaze near Lithgow was caused by a military training exercise. Winmalee also felt the scorching impact. Anatomy of a bush fire: How Australia's explosive forest fires work . ""The house survived; the shed didn't. This all is just a pile of sticks in the air with a roof on it,"" resident Joe Mercieca told CNN affiliate Seven Network, pointing to the devastated aftermath. ""At the end of the day, we hope we have buildings standing. But if we don't have buildings standing, we don't want bodies in them,"" cautioned New South Wales Police Assistant Commissioner Alan Clarke, who commands the major events and incidents group. A total fire ban is in place for the Greater Sydney region until further notice, officials said, meaning no fire may be lit in the open, and all fire permits are suspended. Alison Burke Griffiths, who lives in west suburban Sydney, sent a photo to CNN iReport that showed the late-afternoon sky aglow with a thick orange and gray smog. ""We're from New York originally and have only lived in Australia for two years, so no, we've yet to see something like this,"" Griffiths told iReport. Officials said heavy smoke across Sydney and much of the state is still likely. ""These conditions that we are looking at are a whole new ballgame and in a league of their own,"" said the commissioner of rural fire services, Shane Fitzsimmons. ""The predictive charts indicate that there will be a significant impact on populated areas should all these forecasts materialize."" The situation is so bad that New South Wales Premier Barry O'Farrell declared a state of emergency for the state, which includes Sydney. The declaration gives firefighters special authority as conditions worsen. ""These powers include the right to order the public to leave or to enter an area, the right to shore up or demolish a building, and of course it also prevents people from disobeying an order given under these powers,"" O'Farrell said Sunday. At least one death has been reported. A 63-year-old man died of a suspected heart attack Friday while defending his home against a blaze on the New South Wales Central Coast, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported. Walter Lindner collapsed while working alongside his neighbor to save his heritage-listed homestead, according to ABC. About 1,300 firefighters, including more than 120 from the neighboring state of Victoria, were tackling the blazes Sunday evening. Firefighting forces from the Australian Capital Territory, a self-governing body surrounded by New South Wales, were also deployed to the Blue Mountains. Forecasters are calling for hot, dry and windy conditions over the next few days, Seven Network reported. CNN meteorologist Tom Sater said a front may slowly bring much-needed rain to some areas beginning Tuesday, but heavy winds might complicate firefighting efforts.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- U.S. authorities have discovered about 30 tons of marijuana that were part of a smuggling operation using a tunnel under the California-Mexico border, officials said Wednesday. The 600-yard tunnel -- which features a rail system, lighting and ventilation -- connects a warehouse in Tijuana with one in the Otay Mesa industrial area of San Diego, said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Lauren Mack. About 26 tons of marijuana had been transported through the tunnel to San Diego, and 10 of those tons were intercepted Tuesday by authorities as a tractor trailer was transporting the load from the Otay Mesa warehouse, officials said. About five tons were found by the Mexican military inside the Tijuana warehouse and the tunnel, officials said. Drug cartels on the border have become so powerful and sophisticated in recent years that many Mexican communities and areas along the border are patches of uncontrollable violence, experts have said. ""It's not a good day for the cartels,"" said ICE director John Morton. ""They now can't move that size of drugs without digging a tunnel for 600 yards. It backfired on them. ""Obviously this is a cartel and organized drug smuggling of the highest order,"" Morton added. Authorities weren't able to identify Wednesday which cartel was behind the tunnel operation, he said. The smuggling was active for about a month until this week's seizure. The tunnel was rather small, and an individual can't stand up in it, Morton said. He described the railway as ""crude."" The seizure was also unusual because authorities made their bust while the smuggling was active, Morton said. ""We caught them in the act,"" Morton said. ""We find these tunnels and they're usually abandoned."" The seizure was also one of the largest on the California-Mexican border, officials said. ""What's unusual about this one is the amount of marijuana found as part of this investigation,"" Mack said. The 30 tons is considered significant by U.S. and Mexican authorities even though Mexican authorities seized 105 tons of marijuana in Tijuana last month, the largest Mexican bust in recent years, Mack said. ""So there's been some pretty big drug busts,"" she said. ""We're not letting our guard down."" In the past four years, 75 smuggling tunnels have been discovered on the U.S.-Mexican border, most of them in California and Arizona, authorities said. In all, about 125 tunnels have been found since the early 1990s, when authorities began keeping count, with just one of them on the U.S.-Canadian border, Mack said. Authorities will be investigating the owners of the Tijuana and San Diego warehouses, officials said. A special U.S. border tunnel task force hunts for underground smuggling operations in and around San Diego. The task force consists of agents from ICE, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Border Patrol, and they also work with Mexican authorities, Mack said. In its surveillance of the Otay Mesa warehouse, the task force noticed suspicious activity Tuesday when they saw a tractor-trailer leave the facility. Agents followed the truck to a Border Patrol checkpoint at Temecula, California, and authorities found 10 tons of marijuana hidden in cardboard boxes on pallets, said ICE director John Morton. A married couple driving the truck was arrested, he said. The task force became the first of its kind in 2003, when it was assembled to deal with a growing number of underground smuggling routes on the California-Mexico border. The unit was also assembled as part of a post-September 11 security concerns, Mack said. The longest tunnel discovered, found in 2006, had a length of seven football fields. That tunnel also connected warehouses in Otay Mesa and Tijuana. The task force uses robots to scout out a newly discovered tunnel before agents are sent into it. Federal agents are trained like miners on how to negotiate confined spaces, and the San Diego-Mexico region is even used to test the latest ground-penetrating technology to detect tunnels, including by the U.S. military, Mack said. The sophisticated tunnels -- with lighting, oxygen pumps and rail lines -- are typically used to ferry drugs from Mexico to the United States. The more rudimentary tunnels are just big enough to smuggle people into the country, Mack said. ""We've also been enjoying an unprecedented cooperation with Mexican law enforcement in recent years,"" Mack said. ""So we get a lot of information from the Mexicans, and vice versa.""","NEW: ""It's not a good day for the cartels,"" says ICE director John Morton.

"Washington (CNN) -- The House of Representatives voted Wednesday to overturn the ban on openly gay and lesbian soldiers serving in the U.S. military, passing legislation repealing the controversial ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy. The bill -- a so-called ""stand alone"" measure not tied to any other legislative items -- passed 250 to 175 on mostly partisan lines. It now advances to the Senate. The House previously passed a repeal of the ban as part of a larger defense policy bill, but the measure stalled last week in the Senate. On Wednesday, the top Democrat and Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee announced a compromise on a stripped-down version of the defense policy bill that cut out the ""don't ask, don't tell"" repeal language and some other provisions. Some senators had expressed concern that the policy dispute over ""don't ask, don't tell"" and other issues could undermine the larger defense policy bill, which influences how the Pentagon spends it budget. Also Wednesday, moderate Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine announced her support for repealing ""don't ask, don't tell,"" but only after the Senate completes work on the tax and benefits package and a measure authorizing continued government spending this fiscal year. Snowe became the fourth Republican to publicly support a repeal, giving Democrats an opening to overcome a certain Republican filibuster. Sensing momentum on the issue, President Barack Obama and Defense Secretary Robert Gates called Wednesday for Senate approval so that the repeal can be signed into law. ""Moving forward with the repeal is not only the right thing to do, it will also give our military the clarity and certainty it deserves,"" Obama said in a White House statement. ""We must ensure that Americans who are willing to risk their lives for their country are treated fairly and equally by their country. Gates ""encourages the Senate to pass the legislation this session, enabling the Department of Defense to carefully and responsibly manage a change in this policy instead of risking an abrupt change resulting from a decision in the courts,"" said a statement issued by Pentagon Press Secretary Geoff Morrell. The sponsors of the measure in the Senate -- Connecticut independent Joe Lieberman and Maine Republican Susan Collins -- said the House vote showed bipartisan support for ending the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy. ""It is now the Senate's turn to take the final step toward overturning this discriminatory policy. We are out of excuses,"" their statement concluded. In House debate before Wednesday's vote, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, also said that ""now is the time for us to act."" ""We should honor the service of all who want to contribute"" to America's security, Pelosi said. ""Repealing 'don't ask, don't tell' makes for good public policy."" ""Discrimination is wrong,"" declared Rep. John Lewis, D-Georgia. ""On the battlefield it does not matter who you love. Only the flag that you serve."" Conservative Republicans argued that, among other things, a repeal would place an unreasonable burden on the military at a time when it is already facing severe strains in Afghanistan and elsewhere. This is ""an imposition of somebody's social agenda,"" said Rep. Todd Akin, R-Missouri. It's an ""eclipse of reason, an eclipse of common sense."" ""The United States military is not the YMCA. It's something special,"" said Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-California. This is ""a liberal crusade to create a utopia."" Obama and Democratic leaders are trying to push through a repeal before the end of the current lame-duck congressional session. The more conservative incoming Congress -- which will be seated the first week of January -- is considered far less likely to overturn the Clinton-era ban. The Democratic Senate caucus has 58 members, meaning Democrats need at least two Republicans to join them to overcome a filibuster. So far, Republicans Snowe, Collins, Scott Brown of Massachusetts and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska have said they would support a repeal, but they also have stood by a GOP pledge to block all Senate business until a resolution is reached on extending the Bush tax cuts and authorizing continued government this fiscal year. Both the tax package and the spending authorization proposal are being debated and were expected to be passed in some form by the end of the lame-duck session. However, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, warned Wednesday night that Republican stall tactics could prevent the repeal from coming up before the current lame-duck session expires. ""We are very quickly running out of days in this Congress,"" Reid said in a statement. ""The time for week-long negotiations on amendments and requests for days of debate is over. Republican Senators who favor repealing this discriminatory policy need to join with us now to stand against those who are trying to run out the clock on this Congress."" A Pentagon study released earlier this month concluded that allowing openly gay or lesbian troops to serve in the military would have little lasting impact on the U.S. armed forces. Opposition to the change was much higher in Army and Marine combat units than in the military as a whole. Gates has warned that court challenges to ""don't ask, don't tell"" could force an abrupt repeal of the policy, rather than the process in the legislation that would allow the military to manage the change on a longer timetable. Last spring, Gates made changes that required any fact-finding inquiries about a possible ""don't ask, don't tell"" violation in the ranks to be started by an officer with the rank of colonel or Navy commander or higher. He also initiated rules that made it more difficult for a service member to be removed because of a third-party ""outing."" The number of military discharges made due to the policy has since dropped sharply. CNN's Alan Silverleib, Dana Bash, Deirdre Walsh and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","NEW: Reid warns Republican stall tactics could prevent a repeal from passing .

"(CNN) -- Sony said the Internet security breach targeting its networks was more extensive than originally thought. Hackers also gained access to databases containing subscriber information for Sony Online Entertainment, a San Diego subsidiary that makes online multiplayer games for computers and the PlayStation 3. The Sony division took its Web services offline Monday. That shutdown came 12 days after Sony Computer Entertainment disconnected the PlayStation console game network and Sony Network Entertainment  shut down Qriocity media streaming services. Sony said last week that it expected to start restoring some services this week, but they remain offline. Sony disclosed the first breach on April 22, and then on April 27, the company announced that personal info and perhaps credit card numbers had been stolen for as many as 77 million accounts. With the PC game network also compromised, Sony adds 24.6 million accounts to the pot. Some popular games maintained by Sony's online division include ""EverQuest,"" ""DC Universe Online"" and ""Free Realms."" This additional network was targeted on April 16 and April 17, the same days the other networks were hacked. While the infrastructures are separate, ""There's a degree of architecture that overlaps"" among Sony's many networks, said Michele Sturdivant, a spokeswoman for Sony Online Entertainment. ""Initially, we believed that data was not stolen,"" she said, but then the company uncovered evidence to the contrary during its ongoing investigation. ""They used very sophisticated means to access the data, and they used sophisticated means to cover their tracks."" The information hackers took from Sony Online Entertainment's system included users' names, home addresses, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, login names, encrypted passwords, birth dates and genders. Unlike the last breach, hackers didn't get the answers to security questions or have access to most people's financial information. However, information from an additional 12,700 users stored on a database that was retired in 2007 was also compromised, Sony said. The data there included credit and debit-card numbers and expiration dates, but not security codes, for non-United States residents, as well as direct-debit banking records for some customers in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. Sony apologized for the security lapse and outages on Sunday. The company plans to offer PlayStation account holders a 30-day voucher for the PlayStation Plus service, which lets gamers download free and exclusive games. Current Plus subscribers will get an extra 30 days added to their accounts. Similarly, Sony Online Entertainment will add 30 days to customers' accounts, along with additional play time for each day the service is down. The company also says it is in the process of outlining how it will recompense gamers who own its PlayStation 3 games. Additionally, Sony will offer complimentary assistance for customers who want to enroll in identity theft protection programs. Sony says it's working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation to make sense of the security breach. On Monday, PlayStation spokesman Patrick Seybold denied a report that said the hacker group offered to sell Sony a list of credit card numbers stolen from its systems.","Sony says its online-game services were also targeted in the hack .

The Big Three stories of this week: the 10th anniversary of the start of the Iraq War, the Republican Party's attempt to modernize and President Barack Obama's trip to Israel. Iraq: With Margaret as a veteran of the Bush administration and Dean an Arab-American, there are sharp disagreements on the impact of the Iraq War. I remain darkly fascinated by the enduring partisan divide over whether the war was a mistake -- with conservatives and liberals taking mirror image positions, and centrists and independents like myself pushing national opinion over to the mistake side of the ledger. One contemporary question: Is intervention fatigue slowing America's impulse to stop the slaughter in Syria, where more than 70,000 have been killed while the world watches? GOP modernization: With the Republican Party releasing an ""autopsy"" report on the mistakes that were made throughout the 2012 election, Margaret is marking the release of the paperback edition of her book ""American Individualism: How a New Generation of Conservatives Can Save the Republican Party."" After the paranoid-style party I saw at the Conservative Political Action Conference last weekend, she's got her work cut out for her -- but with Sen. Rob Portman coming out in support of the freedom for same-sex couples to marry, there just might be some hope at the end of this culture war conflict. Obama in Israel: After being attacked throughout the election as being a weak ally to Israel, Obama was given the red carpet treatment this week. But his newfound friendship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu masks a time of real tension and high stakes throughout the region -- including the prospect of protests over stalled peace talks, a potentially nuclear Iran and the bloodshed in Syria. Is this the environment in which a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can succeed? The opinions in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","New CNN Radio podcast features CNN Opinion contributors on top three stories .

"(CNN) -- Britain formally ended its combat mission in Afghanistan on Sunday, lowering the Union Jack for the final time before handing over its last remaining base to Afghan forces. ""I made a commitment that I would get our Armed Forces out of Afghanistan by 2015, and today sees the end of combat operations in the country,"" Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted on Sunday. American troops also took part in the ceremony at the Bastion-Leatherneck coalition base in Helmand province, marking the end of 13 years of UK military operations in the country. Britain's military presence moved to Helmand in 2006 to tackle an insurgency together with troops from the United States and other countries. A total of 453 UK troops have died in service in Afghanistan. ""We will always remember the courage of those who served in Afghanistan on our behalf and never forget those who made the ultimate sacrifice,"" said Cameron. According to the Ministry of Defence, Afghan National Security Forces will take over the bases and all operations. The United Kingdom will continue to support them in their development. Already, the country's military is handling most of its security needs. ""In June 2013, the 330,000-strong ANSF took assumed lead responsibility for security across Afghanistan and since then they have been responsible for 99% of operations,"" the ministry said. Meanwhile, two rocket attacks hit the Wazir Akbar Khan neighborhood of Kabul, home to the American Embassy, reported Pajhwok News Agency and Tolo News, a CNN affiliate that cited Kabul police spokesman Hashmat Stanekzai. There were no known casualties. Also, two rockets landed outside the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in Kabul, confirmed ISAF spokesman Mike Hartnett, speaking to CNN by phone. Hartnett said the attacks resulted in no ISAF casualties.","NEW: Two separate rocket attacks reported in the capital of Kabul .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- On the Reporters Without Borders map of global press freedom, China appears as one big black spot. China is ranked at 173 in the most recent World Press Freedom Index due in part to its track record for imprisoning journalists and censoring the Internet. And the situation shows no sign of improving. Last month, global viewers witnessed reporters for the BBC and CNN get shoved and manhandled outside the trial of activist Xu Zhiyong. Foreign media were literally pushed away from the story. ""And it's gotten much worse in recent years,"" says Charles Hutzler, the Wall Street Journal's China Bureau Chief who has over 20 years of experience covering China. ""Particularly in the countryside and in small towns, if you happen to be covering a story that the local officials just do not want to get out, they will do more than push people around. They will grab cameras and confiscate them, and in some cases smash them."" Visa threat . Foreign correspondents in China face bureaucratic harassment as well, with the increasing threat of having a visa not renewed or even revoked. ""This year of course was unprecedented, the pressure on the New York Times and Bloomberg, both of which had written about the private financial affairs of relatives of senior leaders,"" says Peter Ford, President of the Foreign Correspondents Club of China and Beijing Bureau Chief for the Christian Science Monitor. ""Entire bureaus of those organizations were implicitly threatened, because they had to wait for their visas until the very, very last minute."" Ford adds: ""In the absence of any official explanation of why they had to wait this long, it will certainly feed suspicion that it's retribution for the content of their coverage."" But the risks are far greater for Chinese nationals who can be continually harassed or jailed for contributing to a sensitive report. ""Foreign correspondents are at times vulnerable, but really, the people we most need to protect are our sources, and then our Chinese colleagues, because unlike a foreign correspondent they can't leave,"" Hutzler says. The government says it wants journalists to cover news in an objective and fair-minded way. But at the same time, does what it can to shut down or discredit stories that upset the political balance. Losing its grip . Despite its attempts to pressure reporters and their sources and to craft a state-approved version of events, Beijing appears to be losing its grip on the story. ""As China becomes more open and more integrated in the economy, there's more information available. (With) listed companies in New York and Hong Kong, company records are available. Official affiliations to these companies are available. So the new phenomenon now is getting at the data and to mine the information,"" says Ying Chan, journalism professor at the University of Hong Kong and co-director of the China Media Project. But if China wants an open economy, it must be open to transparency. And more transparency means more data for journalists to dig into. Likewise, more access to social media platforms like Sina Weibo or Tencent's WeChat has led to more citizen journalists breaking the story. ""The proliferation and availability of smartphones means that migrant workers in factories in South China are also communicating through social media, whether it's through WeChat or Weibo,"" says Hutzler. Enterprising reporters . ""The government is trying very hard to get on top of these technologies, but I think the trend is there. They're losing control of the narrative."" Even from inside China's media machine, enterprising local reporters are working independently of the official party line. ""They are doing good work in commercial-run media. But also some are doing good work in the state media and that's interesting,"" Chan tells me. ""We cannot assume that if it's a party paper, you must be toeing the party line. This is the growing diversity of coverage in local Chinese media."" And if they are censored in print, they can always push the story online. Ying Chan fires up WeChat on her smartphone, and shows me an array of independent Chinese media channels inside the popular messaging app. Beijing may be playing rough with reporters, but reporters are playing smart. There's still room to maneuver around China's big black spot on journalism.","Foreign correspondents falling foul of Chinese authorities as they take a tougher line .

"(CNN) -- Tobacco has been ingrained in our society since our nation's earliest days. But if cigarettes were introduced today, they'd most likely never be approved for market. For an example of changing attitudes, just Friday, a Florida jury handed R.J. Reynolds $23.6 billion in damages in a lawsuit filed by the widow of Michael Johnson Sr., a smoker who died at the young age of 36 from lung cancer, leaving her to raise their two children -- an award that will, of course, be appealed. So the announcement of a merger between America's second- and third-largest tobacco companies, R.J. Reynolds and Lorillard, feels like a lost episode of ""Mad Men."" What other industry is permitted to sell a product that, if used as intended, kills half of its consumers? That's not only a dysfunctional public health policy; it's the worst business strategy ever. Imagine the immediate recalls if any other product killed half its customers. What if each Google search or Facebook post took a day off your life? Of course, tobacco has an ingredient that no other consumer product has: nicotine, a substance as addictive as heroin. It's a sure-fire recipe for consumer loyalty to a deadly product, used by companies that have been determined by the federal courts to be liars and racketeers, guilty of putting profits ahead of public health. About 70% of smokers want to quit, but many find it very difficult. This year, we learned another reason why. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health released data showing that between 1999 and 2011, levels of inhaled nicotine in cigarettes had gradually increased by 15%. Quitting is a herculean task, even for the most motivated. Yet there is some positive news. Despite the nicotine manipulation and the nearly $9 billion that Big Tobacco spends each year marketing its deadly products, smoking rates have declined dramatically over the past several decades. Today, youth smoking prevalence is below 10%, and adult smoking rates are at 18%. Clean indoor air initiatives, increased excise taxes and bold anti-tobacco public education campaigns like Legacy Foundation's Truth, the FDA's the Real Cost and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Tips from Former Smokers are formidable weapons against the ever-evolving strategies of the tobacco companies. If stronger standards were adopted, like a ban on menthol or a reduction in nicotine levels in cigarettes, then public health officials could help consumers even more. With the U.S. cigarette market in decline, it shouldn't come as a surprise that these companies want to join forces. Both have business models that depend on securing ""replacement smokers"" -- a term coined by R.J. Reynolds -- for the 480,000 who die each year from the effects of smoking tobacco in the U.S. alone.  Sadly, every day, about 2,100 young people who have been occasional smokers progress to become daily smokers, easily filling the consumer pipeline so vital to meet and exceed their bottom lines. R.J. Reynolds and Lorillard produce Camel and Newport, two of the top cigarette brands young people most often buy. By reducing competition, cutting costs and brainstorming for new strategies, the merger will no doubt try to find new users to make loads of money domestically and worldwide. Of course, there is an alternative -- though highly unlikely -- ending to this story. Merging two tobacco giants and consolidating their research, development, marketing and financial power could be used to invent technologies that bring an end to the burned tobacco horror story of the past century. While the jury is still out on the peril or promise of e-cigarettes, wouldn't it be wonderful if this merger became an opportunity to push reset? Shouldn't the tobacco industry be challenged to introduce products to the marketplace that provide consumer pleasure without the unbearable pain of lung cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer and heart disease? If that could become a reality, we might finally put combustible tobacco -- packed with all its lethal tar and carcinogens -- in the history books for good. Unless this scenario happens, let's not kid ourselves. These companies are jockeying to meet their financial targets, satisfy their shareholders and sell as much deadly tobacco to Americans as they possibly can. Until they truly turn over a new leaf, nearly half a million American lives will continue to go up in smoke each year.","Robin Koval: If cigarettes were introduced today, they'd never be approved for market .

"(CNN) -- The spread of polio constitutes an international public health emergency, the World Health Organization declared Monday. ""If unchecked, this situation could result in failure to eradicate globally one of the world's most serious vaccine preventable diseases,"" the WHO said in a statement. At the end of 2013, 60% of polio cases resulted from the international spread of the virus, and ""there was increasing evidence that adult travelers contributed to the spread,"" according to the statement. Polio mainly affects children under the age of 5, according to the WHO. One in 200 infections leads to irreversible paralysis; 5 to 10% of patients die when their breathing muscles become immobilized. It can only be prevented by vaccination. Of the 10 countries currently infected with polio, three -- Pakistan, Syria and Cameroon -- have allowed the virus to spread internationally, according to an emergency committee convened by the organization, which met late last month. Polio has spread from Pakistan to Afghanistan, from Syria to Iraq and from Cameroon to Equatorial Guinea, according to the WHO. The concern is that the spread comes during the low transmission season for polio, typically January through April, said WHO spokeswoman Christine Feig. This is a ""red flag,"" she said, as ""it has been years"" since the virus was spread to three countries during low season. Polio re-emerged in Syria in October 2013 after a 15-year absence. The ongoing civil war in Syria has hampered immunization rates ""due to the severe interruption of public health services and to the conditions in which the people are living,"" according to a WHO report. There have been 74 cases of polio so far this year, Dr. Bruce Aylward, WHO assistant director-general for polio, emergencies and country collaboration, said Monday. Of those, 59 were in Pakistan. No other country has reported more than four cases, and the only country with four was Afghanistan, he said. The committee's decision to declare an international public health emergency means that Pakistan, Syria and Cameroon are urged to declare national public health emergencies regarding polio and ensure all residents and long-term visitors are vaccinated. In addition, the WHO said, citizens of those countries traveling internationally should be vaccinated before their departure and carry proof in the form of an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis. Meet India's last polio patient . ""A coordinated international response is deemed essential to stop this international spread of wild poliovirus and to prevent new spread with the onset of the high transmission season in May/June 2014,"" according to the organization. Nations infected with polio, but not spreading the disease internationally now include Afghanistan, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Iraq, Israel, Somalia and Nigeria, the WHO said. Those nations were also encouraged to take similar measures to ensure high levels of vaccination in residents and travelers. While the recommendations are not legally binding, they are in the context of the International Health Regulations, which are binding on member states, Aylward said. ""These recommendations are not legally binding in the strict sense ... but they do carry substantial weight because, of course, they are in the context of a legally binding international treaty,"" Aylward said Monday. No cases of polio have been detected in Israel, but the WHO previously reported the virus was found in sewage samples, as well as in stool samples from children who had been immunized. In all, 417 cases of polio were reported worldwide in 2013, said Aylward. Further spread of the virus could put at risk countries that are currently polio-free but are ""conflict-torn and fragile"" with compromised routine immunization services, the WHO said. The current situation is ""in stark contrast"" to the ""near-cessation"" of the spread of polio from January 2012 through April 2013, according to the statement. In March, Southeast Asia, including India, was declared polio-free. India, the world's second most populous country, was able to achieve the goal by deploying immunization efforts to reach those most vulnerable, according to UNICEF. Polio was eradicated in the United States in 1979, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Vaccination campaign against polio, other diseases begins in Mideast .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Food and Drug Administration warned the public Tuesday not to use body-building products marketed as containing steroids or steroid-like substances. To be a dietary supplement, a product must contain at least one vitamin, mineral, amino acid or herb. The agency said many of the products are sold as dietary substances, but are actually unapproved and misbranded drugs. ""Products marketed for body building and claiming to contain steroids or steroid-like substances are illegal and potentially quite dangerous,"" said the agency's commissioner, Dr. Margaret Hamburg, ""The FDA is taking enforcement action today to protect the public."" The agency sent a warning letter to American Cellular Laboratories Inc., saying it markets and distributes products that are labeled dietary supplements, but that violate the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act because they do not meet the definition of dietary supplement. To be a dietary supplement, the product has to contain one or more dietary ingredients, such as vitamins, minerals, amino acids, or herbs. The affected products are TREN-Xtreme, MASS Xtreme, ESTRO Xtreme, AH-89-Xtreme, HMG Xtreme, MMA-3 Xtreme, VNS-9 Xtreme, and TT-40-Xtreme, the agency said. They are sold as muscle stimulants for body builders who want to add muscle, lose weight and retain muscle mass. Sold mostly at gyms, by mail order and over the Internet, the products claim to have steroid-like ingredients but actually contain synthetic steroids, the agency said. The FDA considers them to be unapproved new drugs and says they are neither effective nor safe. Over the past two years, the agency said, it has received five adverse reports directly related to the named products, including serious liver injury. While there were no reports of acute liver failure or death, it said, there were hospitalizations. Another 15 events were attributed to this type of product in general, it said. ""Due to the potentially serious health risks associated with using these types of products, the FDA recommends that consumers immediately stop using all body-building products that claim to contain steroids or steroid-like substances,"" the agency said in a public health advisory. The agency recommends that anyone taking the products stop immediately and see a doctor if they experience various side effects. American Cellular Laboratories has been given 15 business days to respond in writing to the warning letter, outlining the corrective steps they plan to take.","Agency says some products are misbranded as dietary substances .

"Biloxi, Mississippi (CNN) -- The effort to place a massive containment dome over a gushing underwater wellhead in the Gulf of Mexico was dealt a setback when a large volume of hydrates -- icelike crystals that form when gas combines with water -- accumulated inside the vessel, a BP official said Saturday. The dome was moved off to the side of the wellhead and is resting on the seabed while crews work to overcome the challenge, a process expected to take at least two days, BP's chief operations officer Doug Suttles said. Suttles declined to call it a failed operation but said ""What we attempted to do last night didn't work."" Suttles said the gas hydrates are lighter than water and, as a result, made the dome buoyant. The crystals also blocked the top of the dome, which would prevent oil from being funneled up to a drill ship. ""We did anticipate hydrates being a problem, but not this significant [of one],"" he said. Also Saturday, response crews discovered tar balls on a beach on Dauphin Island, Alabama, and sent them to a lab to determine if they're from the Gulf Coast oil slick. The analysis could take 48 hours to complete, the Deepwater Horizon Incident Joint Information Center said Saturday. The tar balls, which a U.S. Coast Guard spokesman described as ""pieces of emulsified oil"" shaped like pancakes, ranged in size from dimes to golf balls. Tar balls can sometimes occur naturally, said the spokesman, Erik Swanson. Cleanup crews have placed snare boom -- a pompom shaped material designed to collect tar balls -- around Dauphin Island. Two options officials are looking at to resolve the problem are heating the dome or adding methanol to dissolve the hydrates, Suttles said, adding that they are continuing to assess other methods to capturing the oil. The crude is leaking at a rate of 210,000 gallons (5,000 barrels) a day. Suttles said that another possible solution would be to ""take ground-up material of various types and try to inject it into the blowout preventer at the bottom of it and it will flow up and plug it up,"" an operation he compared to stopping up a toilet. The maneuver is called a ""junk shot,"" Suttles said. The blowout preventer is a 48-foot-tall, 450-ton apparatus that sits atop the well 5,000 feet underwater. It would stop the leak, BP has said, but it has not been working properly since the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded in flames on April 20 and sank two days later, triggering an oil spill that President Obama has called a ""potentially unprecedented environmental disaster."" Suttles cautioned that a junk shot is not without risk or challenge, which is why crews have not yet attempted the method. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of feet of boom and large volumes of dispersants continued to be deployed in an effort to capture or break up the spilled oil moving toward the Gulf coastline, and thousands of workers and volunteers diligently worked to skim the water's surface. Suttles said 17,500 barrels (735,000 gallons) of oil-water mix were collected Friday, and crews conducted five successful controlled burns. Hopes were high for the success of the four-story containment dome, but officials had cautioned that the risky operation had never been tried at such a depth. ""It's a technology first,"" BP CEO Tony Hayward said Friday. He said the dome works in 300 to 400 feet of water, ""but the pressures and temperatures are very different here. So we cannot be confident that it will work."" The arduous process takes time, Hayward said. Casi Calloway, CEO of the environmental group Mobile Baykeeper, said Saturday she wasn't counting on the operation to be successful. ""I'm praying for them to come up with anything,"" she said. ""In the meantime, though, we have to be realistic and we have to be planning, because it's still a minimum of 5,000 barrels [a day] pouring out into the Gulf of Mexico until that thing is stopped."" If the hydrate problem is resolved, BP, which owns the well, hopes to connect the dome to a drill ship over the weekend and to begin sucking oil from the containment dome up to the ship by the beginning of next week, Suttles said Friday. The stakes are high for residents of coastal Louisiana who make their living from fishing in the Gulf. Oil washed ashore Thursday on Louisiana's barrier islands and drifted west past the mouth of the Mississippi River. ""It's killing everybody down here, everybody is more or less getting ulcers worrying about this, and it's something we experienced five years ago with [Hurricane] Katrina,"" charter boat owner Tom Becker told CNN Saturday. ""But we knew it was coming faster than this thing is and we don't know what the long-term effect of what's going to happen with this if it [the oil] does get up here."" On Friday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said it has expanded the area closed to fishing to better reflect the spill's location. The restriction, announced Sunday, is being extended until May 17, the agency said.","NEW: BP officials considering ""junk shot"" of trying to clog blowout container with material .

"(CNN) -- Madness has gripped our border. I am not talking about the migrant children fleeing from crime and violence in their home countries in Central America and looking for the opportunity to live a better life. I am talking about the misguided protestersâ€”and the right-wing public officials that egg them on, railing against anything they think even might be an immigrant. Here is an example: On Tuesday a group of protesters in Oracle, Arizona, whipped up by a local sheriff known for his extremist views on immigration, mistakenly blocked a bus full of YMCA children. They thought the kids were unaccompanied minors from Central America being bussed to a local facility where they would be cared for. In the same incident, Adam Kwasman, an opportunistic local Republican congressional candidate, who was slightly behind the curve, jumped in to claim that when he went to confront the bus, he saw fear in the faces of the ""migrant"" children because of the lack of rule of law and enforcement. When a reporter clued him in about the YMCA, an awkward back-pedal ensued. It would be comical if it were not so serious. America's crisis on the border needs solutions, but they must live up to our American values and reflect who we are as a country. And they must be bipartisan. Republicans need to get hold of themselves, understand facts and keep their anti-immigrant extremist voices in check. If they don't do it for the country's future, they should at least do it for their own political survival. Republicans cannot afford to further alienate the county's largest minority. If the GOP does not reverse its lack of Latino support, it can say good-bye to its chances of getting to the Casa Blanca. So, how about dropping the political posturing and perhaps redeeming the party in the face of a crisis that could not be more personal to Latinos? This may be too much to ask. Take Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. His solution is a hard-line approach, demanding that any legislation dealing with the border crisis include an end to the President's Deferred Action for Child Arrival. DACA allows children brought here by parents, through no fault of their own, to remain in the only country they know and to contribute without fear of deportation. Cruz's fix would deport Dreamers' who have not yet applied or been granted deferral. Even some Republicans acknowledge that deporting children who have been here their whole lives, sometimes becoming valedictorians and serving in the U.S. military (or expressing a desire to do so) makes no sense and is no solution to the crisis. But Cruz is walking in lockstep with nativist-and-proud Iowa Rep. Steve King. One of the few immigration bills that passed this Congress was sponsored by King and called for the deportation of all of these so-called Dreamer kids. Not unusual for a congressman who cannot talk about immigrants without talking about criminals. Such dehumanization of immigrants as ""the other"" is too common on the right. (One GOP elected official, a Kansas state legislator, once went so far as to ""joke"" that shooting undocumented immigrants from helicopters might be a good way to keep them in check.) Come on, GOP, callous grandstanding only proves to the American people you are interested in politicking, not governing. To do that, you will have to acknowledge facts. Texas Gov. Rick Perry said this past Sunday that President Obama's request for emergency funding did not include enough money for border security. He also suggested the National Guard be called in to stand at the Rio Grande to act as a ""deterrent"" for the unaccompanied minors and women crossing the border. He and other Republicans claimâ€”ludicrously--that President Obama needs to secure the border and that they can't trust him to enforce immigration laws . Why is this ludicrous? The fact is this president has been a stronger enforcer of our deportation laws than any other president before him, even to the chagrin of some of his allies, who have dubbed him the Deporter-in-Chief. The fact is this president has tripled enforcement resources on the border and doubled the number of border patrol agents, which is more than any other president in recent history has done. The fact is that during the Bush administration, the undocumented population added anywhere from 3 million to 4 million people. Its growth under President Obama has been net negative. Even if 100,000 children ultimately show up at the border this year and all of them end up staying, the growth of the undocumented population under President Obama will still be less than zero compared with any other recent U.S. president. The fact is these children are not a national security threat. They are not fleeing from Border Patrol agents. They are doing exactly the opposite and turning themselves in to the first law enforcement agents they see. Calling out the National Guard, as Perry has suggested, would not deter them; it might even give these migrants more hope, because there would be more law enforcement officials in whose arms they could collapse. The fact is, had the bipartisan Senate immigration bill passed, with its stronger border protection measures and strategies for facilitating legal flows of workers at the borders, the country could have spoken out loud and clear to potential immigrants about the United States' immigration policy. It would have made it much harder for criminal actors to distort our country's position and for smugglers to take advantage of parents who only want a better life for their children. But instead of working with the President and Democrats on reforming our badly broken immigration systemâ€”a reform that majorities of Americans, including Republican voters, support--the GOP is capitulating to the most extreme factions of their party who scream ""AMNESTY"" at the top of their lungs whenever talk of immigration comes along. Then they blame President Obama for sending the wrong signals to other countries?

They don't get to have it both ways. They cannot yell that the house in on fire and then cut off the water supply to put that fire out. Right now Republicans may prefer a pure red meat strategy on the border crisis, led by their anti-immigrant nativist wing and designed to draw the narrow base to the polls, but if they don't find a way to work on real solutions--and fast--political reality will be abrupt and ugly for the GOP come 2016 and beyond.","Maria Cardona: Border protests show madness of right-wing to all things immigration .

"URUMQI, China (CNN) -- Several hundred people staged a new protest in Urumqi on Tuesday, demanding the release of relatives detained in connection with weekend demonstrations by ethnic Uyghur residents in China's far western Xinjiang region. Ethnic Uyghur women grab the arm of a policeman as they protest in Urumqi on July 7. The crowd of 200 to 300 -- mostly women and elderly -- quickly formed as local authorities were taking members of the media on a tour of a neighborhood that was heavily damaged during riots over the weekend, witnesses said. Riot police quickly moved in to defuse the standoff as the demonstrators shouted the names of family members they wanted released. The protest is the latest sign that tensions are still simmering in the Xinjiang capital, where violent demonstrations have left 156 people dead and more than 1,000 injured, according to the regional public security department. In southern China, police have detained 15 suspects in connection with an incident that may have spurred the deadly rioting in Urumqi, state-run media reported. There is speculation that Sunday's protest, which took place in the predominantly Uyghur-populated Bazaar district, may have been a reaction to ethnic violence in southern China. The violence took place late last month at a toy factory in Guangdong province, where many migrants, including Uyghurs, have moved in search of work. A massive brawl reportedly broke out between workers of Uyghur and Han nationalities. Two Uyghurs reportedly died. The unrest in Urumqi had been brought under control with a massive presence of soldiers and anti-riot squads, the government said Tuesday. Curfews were in force in major districts of the capital. At least 1,434 suspects had been detained by Tuesday morning, the Xinhua news agency reported, citing government officials. ""The police have started interrogations with the suspects,"" said Li Yi, a spokesman for the Communist Party in Xinjiang. Those convicted would be dealt with severely, he said.  Watch more on violence in Xinjiang » . In a rare public display of dissatisfaction, thousands of Uyghurs -- many of whom feel they are treated as second-class citizens by the majority Han Chinese -- took to the streets Sunday chanting and screaming, prompting a police lockdown of the city. State-run media reported that protesters attacked passersby, burned public buses and blocked traffic. The report did not say how many people took part or what their grievances were. But a witness in Urumqi told CNN that, soon after the protest started about 5 p.m., hundreds of demonstrators ""grew into easily over 1,000 -- men, women and children, all ethnic Uyghurs -- screaming and chanting."" Police arrived quickly and tried to control the swelling crowd by erecting barriers in the street, but ""people pushed them over,"" the witness said. ""They were throwing rocks at passing cars and buses."" As the violence escalated, hundreds of riot police arrived, the witness said. ""They used tear gas and fire hoses to disperse the crowd. I saw fire trucks, ambulances, armed personnel carriers and what looked like tanks. I heard random gunshots."" iReport.com: Are you there? Share photos, video, commentary . Late Sunday, the witness said, Urumqi was in a lockdown, with hundreds of People's Liberation Army soldiers in the streets. He reported seeing riot police chasing protesters into alleys and rounding up many of them. Xinjiang is home to many Uyghurs. China's constitution guarantees ethnic minorities equal rights and limited autonomy. However, ethnic tensions run deep. Minority groups such as the Uyghurs complain that they are subjected to discrimination by the majority Han.  See a map of Xinjiang » . Tensions also ran high in Han communities in the capital on Tuesday as neighbors organized to protect themselves and their businesses. Groups of men carrying pipes, sticks and cleavers milled in front of shops before police dispersed them. ""The Uyghurs will attack any Han they see,"" one man said. The World Uyghur Congress, a dissident Uyghur group based in Munich, Germany, condemned the crackdown on what it described in a written statement as Sunday's ""peaceful protest"" by Uyghurs. ""The Chinese authorities should acknowledge that the peaceful protest was sparked by the unlawful mob beating and killing of Uyghur workers at a Guangdong toy factory more than a week ago,"" it said. ""The authorities should also acknowledge that their failure to take any meaningful action to punish the Chinese mob for the brutal murder of Uyghurs is the real cause of this protest."" It accused the Chinese authorities of having ""used tear gas, automatic rifles and armored vehicles to disperse the Uyghur protesters. During the crackdown, some were shot to death, and some were beaten to death by Chinese police. Some demonstrators were even crushed by armored vehicles near Xinjiang University, according to eyewitnesses.""  Watch victims describe the riots in Urumqi » . The government in Xinjiang blamed ""foreign forces"" for Sunday's rioting. ""The violence is premeditated, organized violent crime,"" said Nur Bekri, chairman of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region, the equivalent of a governor. ""It was instigated and directed from abroad and carried out by outlaws in the country."" Bekri accused the World Uyghur Congress of spreading rumors and inciting anger that led to the rioting, in a speech carried by Xinjiang television. The World Uyghur Congress denied the charge. It is led by Rebuya Kadeer, a businesswoman of Uyghur ethnicity who was detained in 1999 and accused of harming China's national security. She was freed on bail in 2005 and was allowed to leave for the United States for medical care. Bekri accused Kadeer of instigating the unrest via the Internet and said the fight at the Guangdong toy factory was exploited to incite ethnic strife. Internet service was hard to come by in Urumqi on Tuesday. Reporters' BlackBerries could not send and receive messages. Computers could not access the Web at their hotels.","Hundreds protest mass arrests following ethnic unrest in China's Xinjiang region .

"DUBAI (CNN) -- A court in Dubai sentenced two men Wednesday to 15 years in prison for the rape and kidnapping of a 15-year-old French boy. Veronique Robert, mother of the 15-year-old French-Swiss teen, speaking outside a court in Dubai. The boy's mother, Veronique Robert, was visibly upset after the sentence was read and promised to appeal. Robert, a French journalist, brought the case to the media's attention in recent months in an effort to shed light on what she deemed to be injustices in the pro-Western emirate of Dubai. Robert said Wednesday's sentence was too lenient for a crime that she believes is tantamount to attempted murder because one of her son's attackers was knowingly HIV-positive at the time of the rape. She refrained from asking the death penalty for her son's attackers, but said she hoped the sentence would be much longer. A spokesman for the Dubai government, Habib al Mulla, told CNN the sentence was in accordance with international standards and was not lenient. ""Today's verdict has proven that the system is efficient and is fair to all parties involved,"" al Mulla said. The case began in July, when the two men, 36 and 18, kidnapped and raped the French teenager at knifepoint. Robert contacted French diplomats, who took up the allegations with Dubai authorities. Al Mulla said police action was swift and arrests were made within 24 hours. But Robert has said the case was botched from the start, beginning with her son's examination by a doctor who said her son was gay. Homosexuality in Dubai is illegal, and the teen could have faced as much as a year in prison. Robert's son has since returned to France and was not in court for Wednesday's sentencing. Robert has also said Dubai authorities repeatedly concealed evidence -- confirmed in court papers -- that one of the attackers was HIV-positive. Robert said her son, who is still awaiting test results to find out whether he has the virus, could have gotten treatment much sooner had they known. Dubai authorities deny any evidence was concealed. The case has shed light on Dubai's attitudes toward rape and homosexuality, which some Western observers have said is outdated. Al Mulla, however, said Wednesday's sentencing and the government's handling of the case proves the country's system works. ""It's today's verdict which proves that there is a system,"" al Mulla said. ""The system is working properly. However, if there is any room for any improvement in the system, we'll definitely look into it, consider it, and if there's any room for improvement, we'll implement it."" The mother has already filed suit in courts in Paris and Geneva, Switzerland seeking compensation from Sheikh Khalifa, president of the United Arab Emirates, and the prime minister and vice president of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed al Maktoum. She is also suing others, including the Dubai police chief. Robert started a Web site over the summer, boycottdubai.com, demanding better treatment for children who suffer sexual assault there. At a press conference last month, she proclaimed, ""We are here because I just would like first justice for my son; and second for every girl and boy who was raped and even had no chance to speak."" Robert said she will drop all her pending cases if the government sets up rape clinics, recognizes the status of rape victims, and takes precautions after rape against sexually-transmitted diseases. In the wake of Wednesday's verdict, Robert said a Dubai government official told her the emirate plans to open its first rape clinic, which she said was a small victory. The government has not yet officially announced its plans to open such a facility. Al Mulla told CNN that Dubai believes a reception center for rape victims is ""a good solution."" ""We are considering it,"" he said, regarding Robert's request. ""We believe it's good. It's good for the victims, and it's good for the whole system.""  E-mail to a friend .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Actress Halle Berry and husband, Olivier Martinez, welcomed the birth of their first son Saturday. A representative for Berry would not share any other details about the boy -- Berry's second child -- including where he was born or his name. The Oscar-winner has a 5-year-old daughter with ex-boyfriend Gabriel Aubry. Berry, 47, married Martinez, 47, in a private ceremony in France in July. It is the third marriage for the Berry, who revealed in April that she was expecting a baby with the French actor. Berry and Martinez began their relationship last year after meeting on the set of the film ""Dark Tide."" Martinez was by her side through the last months of her bitter custody battle with Aubry, the Canadian model who fathered daughter Nahla. They reached ""an amicable agreement"" over custody in November, a week after a Thanksgiving Day fistfight in Berry's Hollywood driveway between Martinez and Aubry. Berry was previously married to former pro baseball player David Justice -- from 1993 until 1996 -- and singer Eric Benet -- from 2001 to 2004. ""This has been the biggest surprise of my life, to tell you the truth,"" Berry told CNN when discussing her pregnancy in April.

"Madrid (CNN) -- It's an ominous number. There could be up to 10,000 new Ebola cases per week in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone by the end of this year as the outbreak spreads, the World Health Organization warned Tuesday. And now that a nurse has become the first person to contract Ebola on American soil, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it has a new plan to help hospitals handle the deadly virus. ""For any hospital anywhere in the country that has a confirmed case of Ebola, we will put a team on the ground within hours,"" CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden told reporters. The response team will include experts in infection control, protective equipment and experimental therapies. A team such as that, Frieden said, might have prevented a Dallas nurse from contracting the disease. The nurse was a member of the medical team that treated an Ebola patient who died last week. ""I wish we had put a team like this on the ground the day the first patient was diagnosed. That might have prevented this infection,"" Frieden said. ""But we will do that from this day onward with any case anywhere in the U.S."" In addition to the many experts it sent to Dallas, Frieden said, the CDC ""could have sent a more robust hospital infection control team and been more hands-on with the hospital from day one about exactly how this should be managed. ""Ebola is unfamiliar. It's scary,"" said Frieden. ""And getting it right is really, really important, because the stakes are so high."" Speaking to reporters in Switzerland, WHO Assistant Director-General Dr. Bruce Aylward told reporters that the Ebola outbreak could get worse before it gets better. By December, he said, there could be between 5,000 and 10,000 new cases weekly in West Africa. Compare those December projections to the latest figures. As of Tuesday morning, there were a total of 8,914 Ebola cases and 4,447 deaths reported to the WHO, Aylward said. The outbreak's mortality rate, he said, is about 70%. ""This has been a deadly disease ever since we discovered it in 1976,"" said Dr. Seema Yasmin, a staff writer at the Dallas Morning News and a former CDC disease detective. ""Certainly the death rate can be lowered if we don't have any delays in diagnosis and don't have any delays in treating people,"" Yasmin told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. Aylward told reporters that in 90 days, officials have a goal they're aiming for: They want to see the number of cases dropping from week to week. To start to decrease the rate of infection, the WHO says it hopes to isolate 70% of Ebola patients and have 70% of Ebola victim burials performed safely by December 1. Getting responders, facilities and plans in place to meet the goal will be very difficult, Aylward said. Missing the goal will mean that more people will die than should have and that even more resources will be needed because the infection rate will continue to climb, he said. Dallas nurse speaks . Days after authorities announced that a Dallas nurse had contracted Ebola, concerns in the United States have focused on a key question: Are people who are putting themselves in harm's way to care for Ebola victims receiving the training and equipment they need? ""I've been hearing loud and clear from health care workers from around the country that they're worried, that they don't feel prepared to take care of a patient with Ebola,"" Frieden said. Every hospital in the United States needs to be prepared to handle Ebola, he said, adding that the CDC will be stepping up training efforts. The Dallas nurse, Nina Pham, had cared for Liberian national Thomas Eric Duncan, who contracted Ebola in Liberia and died of the illness at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. ""A single infection in a health care worker is unacceptable,"" Frieden said. ""And what we're doing at this point is looking at everything we can do to minimize that risk so those that are caring for her do that safely and effectively."" At least 76 health care workers who may have come into contact with Duncan after he was hospitalized are now being monitored for symptoms of the disease, Frieden said. At the Dallas hospital, teams from the CDC are taking a number of steps to improve safety in handling Ebola, Frieden said, including ensuring there's a site manager making sure protective equipment is put on and taken off correctly. ""There wasn't a single individual accountable for that,"" he said. ""That's a critical role and that's there now."" They're also improving training at the hospital and limiting the number of staff who go into the isolation area, he said. In a statement Tuesday, Pham thanked supporters for sending kind wishes and prayers, according to the Dallas hospital where she is being treated. ""I am blessed by the support of family and friends and am blessed to be cared for by the best team of doctors and nurses in the world,"" she said. Infected nurse's assistant 'helping' as doctors treat her . Health authorities in Spain said a nurse's assistant who is the first person to contract Ebola in Europe in the current outbreak is still in serious condition but doing better. And even as Teresa Romero Ramos lies in a hospital bed, she's doing everything she can to take care of doctors, nurses and herself, said Dr. Marta Arsuaga, who is Romero's doctor and friend. ""She is helping us to treat her. ... She was where I am now, so she knows what I have to do,"" Arsuaga said. Romero's case, like Pham's, has raised serious questions about how equipped hospitals are to cope with the Ebola outbreak. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said Monday that the Madrid hospital treating Romero doesn't meet all the standards set for centers capable of Ebola care. And in a scathing letter, Javier Limon, Romero's husband, said she received only 30 minutes of training in putting on protective gear and called for the resignation of Madrid's regional health minister over how the case has been handled. Romero helped care for one of two Spanish missionaries who were brought back to Madrid for treatment after being infected with the virus in West Africa. Both men died of the illness. Besides treating Romero, Spanish authorities are monitoring 81 potential Ebola cases -- 15 in hospitals and 66 at home, according to the Spanish Ministry of Health. None of them is showing symptoms of Ebola, the ministry said. Romero is stable but remains in serious condition, Antonio Andreu, director of the Carlos III Hospital in Madrid, said at a news conference. A spokesman for a special committee created in Spain to keep people informed about Ebola said Spain will have a contagious diseases reference center in each of its regions. Police, firefighters and ambulance personnel, as well as hospital staff, will be trained to deal with Ebola cases. Andreu insisted that Spain's health care professionals have the situation under control. But he said more training will be given to health care workers and new guidelines will be prepared. ""Ebola is not a problem of Spain. It is not a problem of the United States,"" he said. ""It's a global problem.""

"(CNN) -- Thiago Silva knows his history -- it's a good job too given it's very much weighing on his shoulders. Brazil's iconic Maracana Stadium may have been given a $500 million upgrade, but beneath the new shiny exterior, the scars of pain and anguish are still raw for many Brazilians. But next year Brazil has a chance to exorcize those demons as the South American country hosts the World Cup for the first time since 1950. Then football's greatest show ended in tears and failure after a 2-1 defeat against Uruguay in the final match of the tournament crushed any illusion of supremacy and left a proud country nursing a pain which still runs deep to this very day. ""Every day there's something going on in my head,"" Brazilian captain Silva, whose hands could grasp the famous old trophy 64 years on should Brazil be victorious, told CNN. ""Even the Brazilian press won't allow us to forget the World Cup in 1950 in a full Maracana. ""So that idea gets stuck in your head, but that's good. It's something we can resolve. ""We expect a lot from ourselves. We talk a lot and our commitment is very big, so I believe we are going to have a lot of success. ""It's not going to be easy but we are on the right track."" At the age of 28, Silva has established himself as one of the most accomplished defenders in the world following an outstanding season with Paris Saint-Germain. All this in the space of five years since arriving in Europe with AC Milan from Fluminese in 2008. After winning the 2011 league title with Milan and being honored as the top defender in Serie A, he made a $55 million move to PSG the following year along with striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Now, following a series of glowing performances on the domestic front and in the European Champions League, the defender is aiming to peak in time for next year's global blockbuster. ""I see myself as an important player on the pitch and in the tactical scheme of the National team,"" said Silva. ""I see myself as a reference for the rest of the group. We don't know what's going to happen in the future, but so far (at the moment) I'm the captain of the Brazil team. ""It's a unique experience in my life, to represent thousands of Brazilians across the world. It's not for everyone. ""Fortunately things have been going well. We are not 100% aware of our capabilities, but we are very close to what we can achieve."" One man who could prove intrinsic to Brazil's success is the precociously talented Neymar -- largely considered to be one of world football's hottest properties. The Santos striker, who is reportedly being courted by both Spanish giants Barcelona and Real Madrid, is expected to spearhead Brazil's attack. But Neymar does not come without his critics -- one of whom is Brazilian legend Pele, who has accused the youngster of being more interested in his hairdo than his football. A lack of playing experience in European competition has also cast question marks over Neymar's ability to compete on the very highest stage. His anonymous showing in the final of the London Olympics against Mexico in 2012 led to a barrage of criticism and accusations that he is simply not living up to his hype. But Silva says Neymar will only prove successful when his critics allow him to get on with what he does best -- playing football. ""Our biggest star nowadays is Neymar and I think people have to have a little bit more respect with the professional that is Ney,"" said Silva. ""He's a great guy with a very pure and good heart and people sometimes make things up and start talking rubbish where there's nothing to talk about. ""I would like to ask for people to have a bit more patience with him because he's our biggest star at the moment. ""If he's not relaxed and ready to play and doesn't have support, the team can suffer a lot from it."" The man charged with harnessing Neymar's talent is coach Luis Felipe Scolari -- the mastermind behind Brazil's last march to World Cup glory in 2002. Scolari, who was reappointed last November, will first target June's Confederations Cup with success there likely to further boost expectations in Brazil. The 64-year-old, affectionately known as ""Big Phil"", first took on the job in 2001 before guiding Brazil to success in Japan and South Korea the following year. ""He's a serious guy,"" Silva said of the national coach, who has also enjoyed time in charge of Portugal and Chelsea amongst many others. ""On the other hand, he's happy as well, very joyful,"" added the Brazil captain. ""He has his moments to have fun, but he's a guy that when it's time to work, it's time to work and to be serious about what you are doing. ""What I like about him is his personality. He's a firm guy in his words, if you are not playing well, you will get benched. ""If you are benched and are training well you will have your opportunity. ""He's a very open person. If you are playing well you will play, if not, you won't play, that's the way football should be. ""I see in him a very positive guy. He's a person who has won it all and wants to win even more. ""I hope we can have success together since we are getting a strong group for the World Cup and to win titles, which is the most important in football."" Scolari's selection policy will no doubt be heavily scrutinized with question marks still hanging over the likes of Ronaldinho and Kaka. World Cup winner Ronaldinho, 33, played against England in January 2013 having not featured on the international stage for nearly a year. Kaka, 31, was once considered the finest player in the world but has seen his career stagnate since moving from Milan to Real Madrid in 2009. Both men still harbor ambitions of pulling on the famous yellow shirt in front of their home fans -- a dream which is still intact according to Silva. ""There's always room in our team for players who are in good form,"" he added. ""I'm sure if they are playing well, they will have other opportunities. ""Brazil's team is like that, it's filled with opportunities and players of great quality. ""When you're talking about Kaka and Ronaldinho -- I don't even have words to describe those two great players that the Brazilian football has. ""You can be sure that if they are playing well in their clubs, I'm sure Scolari will give them another opportunity.""","Brazil will host the World Cup next year for the first time since 1950 .

"(CNN) -- Traces of narcotics and hypodermic needles found with the bodies of two American security officers on the container ship Maersk Alabama suggested the deaths resulted from drug overdoses, a Seychelles government official has told CNN. Seychelles police identified the bodies found Tuesday as Jeffrey Reynolds and Mark Kennedy, both 44. They worked for Trident Group, a Virginia-based maritime security services firm. Trident Group President Tom Rothrauff said both were former Navy SEALs. ""It's bizarre. Of course, it's a shock. They're all great guys,"" Rothrauff said. ""I'm absolutely clueless as to what happened."" Police said an autopsy would be carried out early next week. But the Seychelles government official, who spoke on condition of not being identified, said Thursday that the presence of drug traces and paraphernalia ""would suggest that their deaths were a result of drug overdose."" A Seychelles police statement said that despite media accounts of traces of drugs, authorities have not released any reports suggesting the deaths were the result of an overdose. The statement, however, did not deny that drugs were found or suggest an alternative cause of death. The 500-foot Maersk Alabama was the target of an attempted hijacking in the pirate-infested waters off East Africa in 2009 -- an incident that inspired the 2013 film ""Captain Phillips."" The shipping giant Maersk, which hired the Trident Group to guard its ships, said Thursday that Trident would be conducting random drug tests of its employees. ""Based on our experience with the contractor, this is an isolated incident,"" Maersk said. But it said new drug tests would start immediately and the company's shore-leave policy was under review. The Maersk Alabama has since left the Seychelles capital of Port Victoria, the company said Thursday. Police said the ship arrived Sunday in the Seychelles, an archipelago in the Indian Ocean, with a 24-man crew and had been expected to leave Tuesday. The bodies were found by a colleague who had gone to check in on one of the men in a cabin at about 4:30 p.m. Tuesday, Seychelles police said. Lt. Cmdr. Jamie Frederick, a U.S. Coast Guard spokesman, said the service was investigating the deaths, as required by American law. But he said the deaths ""do not appear to be criminal in nature, related to vessel operations, the material condition of the ship or their duties as security personnel."" In April 2009, four armed pirates attempted to hijack the Maersk Alabama 380 miles off Somalia. After the crew sank the pirates' vessel and foiled their efforts to take control of the container ship, the pirates took the ship's captain, Richard Phillips, hostage on a lifeboat. The incident ended three days later when Navy sharpshooters killed three of the pirates and captured the fourth. Phillips was unharmed. Pirates attacked the ship again later that year, but armed security personnel fought them off. In March 2011, another attempt by pirates to board the ship was thwarted when security personnel fired warning shots. 2010: Hero skipper ignored pirate warnings, crew says . 2009: Crewman's e-mail gives harrowing details of hijacking .","Maersk, security contractor launch drug testing plan after deaths .

"(CNN) -- Inventors across the country are being asked to find a way to lighten the load U.S. soldiers carry on their backs -- largely due to the high-tech gear that uses batteries -- and the solution will be decided in a $1 million contest. The military wants to lighten the load troops carry into combat. The Department of Defense is asking a person or team to come up with a way to lessen the weight of the 20-40 pounds of batteries a solider carries on a typical four-day mission. The batteries power everything from soldiers' GPS systems to their night-vision goggles. ""In many missions the batteries are heavier than the ammunition they are carrying,"" said Dr. William S. Rees Jr., Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Laboratories and Basic Sciences -- whose office, the Director of Defense Research and Engineering, is sponsoring the prize competition. ""We'd like to reverse that ratio."" Some missions require as much as 100 pounds of equipment, according to Brig. General Mark Brown who commands the Army's Program Executive Office Soldier program.  See what troops are carrying and wearing into combat » . ""Any weight reduction on batteries would really help us out,"" Army Spc. Daniel Tinsely, currently serving in Iraq, told CNN's Federick Pleitgen.  Watch as Tinsely explains the gear he carries and the batteries required » . ""It's a challenge we've had in the military forever,"" said CNN military analyst retired Army Brig. Gen. James ""Spider"" Marks. Marks says one of the best things to help out the soldiers would be to give them a ""power pack"" that's miniaturized -- one that can last a long time and doesn't weigh much. And that's the key to winning the $1 million. The whole prototype must weigh 8.8 pounds (4 kilograms) or less and produce 20 watts average power for 4 days or 96 hours. It has to be wearable, like a vest, and will undergo rigorous testing. The entry that can demonstrate a wearable electric power system that can provide 96 hours of equipment operation at 8.8 pounds or less, will take first place and the $1 million. Systems coming in second and third place will receive $500,000 and $250,000. The contest, announced July 5, will take place in the fall of 2008. It is open to individuals and teams and the DDR&E hopes to attract entrepreneurs as well as traditional defense contractors. This is the first cash prize giveaway by the DDR&E, Rees added. ""We welcome all players to the game,"" he said. An individual must be a U.S. citizen and at least 21 years old. A team can be comprised of non-citizens but the team leader must be a U.S. citizen at least 21 years old. During the five-day competition, the top performing systems will take part in an eight-hour trial meant to mimic real life troop activities. Competitors will strap on their prototypes and ""subject their power systems to periods of walking, lying prone, outdoor environmental conditions, potentially short-term cold chambers and off-wearer operation in an airtight container."" The judging panel will consist of government scientists, engineers and military personnel. The military hopes these power packs may also have commercial use in camping, hiking and other outdoor activities. First responders could power radios and search lights with the new technology, Rees suggested. ""You could run a small refrigerator off of it,"" he added. In September the military will hold a public meeting to brief potential competitors on technical details, the rules and qualification requirements. The registration deadline is November 30, 2007.

"(CNN) -- This week marks the centenary of the assassination in Sarajevo of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. This was a key trigger for the devastating First World War, setting off a chain reaction that saw key European powers, including Germany, Russia and Britain, entering conflict soon after. One hundred years on, the world has numerous echoes of the early 20th century with a major shift in global power once again taking place. Whereas Germany, Russia and the United States were key ""rising nations"" in 1914, power is today shifting from the global North to the South with Asian countries, especially China, primary beneficiaries so far. And as 100 years ago, geopolitical tensions are mounting as ""revisionist nations,"" including China and Russia, challenge key elements of the U.S.-led international order. This is partly driven by rising economic power resurrecting nationalism and claims for resources, as witnessed by multiple disputes between China and neighboring countries in the South China Sea for instance. China's rise . While much focus in 2014 has so far been on Russia's annexation of Ukraine, the Syrian conflict, and the rise of Islamic extremist group ISIS in Iraq, it is perhaps Asia where most tension and insecurity lie in terms of potential for a great power war. China's remarkable rise is unsettling the region, and indeed much of the world beyond. And dangers of miscalculation are growing, in part, because of military build-ups. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe drew parallels earlier this year between the geopolitical landscape in Asia today and Europe on the eve of war in 1914. Moreover, Philippine President Benigno Aquino recently compared what he claimed was Beijing's track record of belligerent behavior with German expansionism in the 20th century by openly questioning ""at what point do you say, 'enough is enough?'"" Within Asia, potential triggers for a great power conflict include an escalation of tension between Japan, which the United States has a security treaty with, and China. Another possible flashpoint is Taiwan, again a U.S. ally, which China claims sovereignty over, even though the island has been governed separately since the Chinese civil war in the 1940s. Blighted decades . These risks are real and significant. However, there are key differences today with the world of 1914 which, in the absence of catastrophic miscalculation, makes a major power war unlikely for the foreseeable future. This is not least because memories of the First and indeed Second World Wars, linger powerfully. With justification, the First World War was described as the ""greatest seminal catastrophe"" of the 20th century by U.S. diplomat George Kennan, who would later become the architect for the U.S. Cold War ""containment strategy."" Aside from the many millions who died from 1914 to 1918, the war set in chain several developments which blighted the world for decades to come. These include the emergence of Communism in Russia and -- as numerous historians assert -- the rise of Nazi Germany and the seeds of the Second World War. Another major difference between now and 1914 is the presence of nuclear weapons which, as during the Cold War, generally serve as a brake on major power conflict. It is noteworthy here that it is both revisionist nations, including China and Russia, as well as ""status-quo powers,"" such as the United States and France, that possess nuclear arsenals. A further fundamental change is that, unlike 1914, there is now a dense web of post-war international institutions -- especially the United Nations -- which continue to have significant resilience and legitimacy decades after their creation. While these bodies are imperfect, and in need of reform, the fact remains that they have generally enabled international security, especially with five key powers (United States, Russia, United Kingdom, China, and France) all on the U.N. Security Council. Moreover, the relative balance between the two leading powers today is different in 2014 than 1914. That is, the gap between United States and China is greater today than that between the United Kingdom and Germany 100 years ago. 'American century' Indeed, perhaps the biggest consequence of the First World War was the dawn of what has been called the ""American Century"" in which the United States emerged as the world's most powerful nation. To be sure, the country has undergone relative decline, and China is forecast to become the largest economy in the world this year based on purchasing power parity data. However, the United States remains significantly ahead of China on most measures of national strength, including military might, and is likely to enjoy an overall advantage for years. Indeed, unlike the United Kingdom in the 20th century, there are indications that U.S. power will remain resilient for decades to come in the 21st century, buoyed in part by factors such as the country's ""energy revolution,"" which has far-reaching geopolitical consequences, including from potential energy self-sufficiency. Taken overall, while another major war cannot be ruled out, the prospect of this for the foreseeable future is not as high as 100 years ago. The relative global balance of power is different today, partly because of the resilience of U.S. power. Moreover, nuclear weapons and international institutions, especially the U.N., generally act as a restraining force against major conflict that did not exist in 1914.","This week marks the centenary of the assassination in Sarajevo of Archduke Franz Ferdinand .

"(CNN) -- U.S soccer star Robbie Rogers has ""come out"" as gay on the day he retired from the game Friday. The former Columbus Crew winger represented America on 18 occasions, including at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. But Rogers, who was released from his deal by second-tier club Leeds United last summer before taking up a spot with third-tier Stevenage, revealed on his blog that he is homosexual and keen to seek a life away from football. ""Secrets can cause so much internal damage,"" Rogers wrote on his blog. ""People love to preach about honesty, how honesty is so plain and simple. Try explaining to your loved ones after 25 years you are gay. ""Try convincing yourself that your creator has the most wonderful purpose for you even though you were taught differently. ""I always thought I could hide this secret. Football was my escape, my purpose, my identity. Football hid my secret, gave me more joy than I could have ever imagined. Soccer's last taboo: Why gay players stay in the closet . ""I will always be thankful for my career. I will remember Beijing, The MLS Cup, and most of all my teammates. I will never forget the friends I have made a long the way and the friends that supported me once they knew my secret. ""Now is my time to step away. It's time to discover myself away from football. It's 1 A.M. in London as I write this and I could not be happier with my decision. ""Life is so full of amazing things. I realized I could only truly enjoy my life once I was honest. ""Honesty is a b**** but makes life so simple and clear. My secret is gone, I am a free man, I can move on and live my life as my creator intended."" Rogers' announcement has seen former teammates flock to show their support, with U.S. international defender Oguchi Onyewu, tweeting: ""Extremely proud of the courage from @robbierogers. Truth is not always easy to display, but truly strong people always find a way #RESPECT"" U.S. midfielder Stuart Holden added on Twitter: ""Much love and respect to my boy @robbierogers ! Proud to be your friend bro."" Rogers' retirement means there are still no openly gay players participating in professional football in Europe with the exception of Swedish-based Anton Hysen. 'Brave' cricketer Davies reveals he is gay . It was hoped that Hysen's coming out, which attracted headlines the world over in March 2011, would pave the way for other gay footballers to take similar steps. But not since the tragic loss of Justin Fashanu has a top-flight league witnessed an openly gay professional football player. Fashanu, who committed suicide in 1998, became the first £1 million black player in the history of English football when he signed for Nottingham Forest in 1981. While at Forest, constant rumors and speculation surrounded his private life with concocted allegations of affairs with Conservative MPs. Thomas relief after admitting he is gay . With the rumors continuing throughout his career, he finally came out in 1990 and continued to play for a whole host of lower league clubs. ""You have to understand,"" he said in an interview before his death, ""that footballers are very narrow minded people. It's the nature of the business. When you put yourself in the firing line, you are open to attack. I know I'm there to be shot down in flames."" Following his passing, one particular group of fans would recite the chant: ""He's gay, he's dead, he's hanging in a shed, Fashanu, Fashanu."" Expert: Use gay slurs controversy to tackle homophobia in sports . While there has been huge progress since those dark days, the presence of homophobia in football has not been extinguished. Only this week, police launched an investigation into allegations that a Blackburn Rovers footballer made homophobic gestures towards Brighton fans during an English second division match. View: Hi-res gallery of openly gay athletes . Brighton, which is situated on the south coast, has a large gay population and its fans are often targeted with homophobic chants. ""I think there's a big culture shift needed within football from the grassroots to the top of the game,"" Louise Englefield of FootballvHomophobia told CNN . ""The top of the game is a symptom of a much wider issue about lack of awareness and ignorance around the ability of gay men to participate and excel at football . ""When you've got a lack of gay players at the top level, then it's easy for that environment to be quite negative. ""I imagine there are players who are reticent to come out."" Opinion: Why the fuss about gay marriage? While other sports have embraced their gay stars, such as John Amaechi in basketball, Martina Navratilova in tennis and Gareth Thomas in rugby, football has yet to move with the times. Off the field, the UK Parliament backed a bill to legalize gay marriage earlier this month as society continues to move forward. And while football has yet to move with the times, progress is being made. Premier League and Football League clubs in the UK have created several initiatives to combat homophobia, working alongside charities such as HvF. ""Within football, people don't understand the seriousness of homophobia,"" added Englefield. ""The things fans shout at players, they believe it's not hurting them and they don't care if they're gay or not. ""Homophobia is used to put players down and it's a way of deriding players. That's cultural all the way through football and happens in other sports. ""When a player gives a pass away or falls over, fans use homophobia abuse to put them down and it's that which we want to stop. ""One of our key things is changing chanting in the stadium. Stop and think before you chant."" Liverpool youngster Suso fined for calling teammate 'gay' A particular success story in England has been the creation of the GFSN Gay National League, where ""gay friendly"" teams compete on a regular basis. Rogers' story has been met with admiration from fellow gay football players, but his retirement from the game means that the community is still waiting for a player to come out and continue playing. ""The great pity with Robbie is that he felt it was an 'either or choice,' "" Scott Lawley, who plays for Nottingham Ball Bois in the GFSN Gay National League told CNN. ""Reading his blog, it felt as if he thought he had no choice but to quit football if he wanted come out. ""He could have easily retired without coming out but he's been very brave and hopefully set us in the right direction. ""He hasn't forced us to the point where a gay man runs out in front of 30,000 people to play football . ""And the fact that no professional player has come out in recent years means there are still issues to deal with.

"(CNN) -- A California educator arrested after a former student accused her in a YouTube video of sexual abuse had her arraignment pushed back yet again Friday, meaning she won't formally answer to the charges for another six weeks. Andrea Michelle Cardosa was charged in February with five counts of aggravated sexual assault on a child and 11 counts of lewd acts on a child, the the Riverside County district attorney's office said. Her arraignment, originally scheduled for Thursday, was moved to 9 a.m. (noon ET) Friday. But, while Cardosa was in court, she wasn't arraigned. According to John Hall, a spokesman for the district attorney's office, her arraignment was continued to April 18 at the defense's request. Cardosa's lawyers also plan to ask to reduce her bail then, Hall said. The charges that Cardosa faces came after a former student, now 28, posted a YouTube video in which she accused the educator of abusing her at age 12. Cardosa faces possible life in prison if convicted of the aggravated sexual assault charges. Cardosa's lawyer, Randy Collins, said in a written statement earlier this week that in the face of ""very public claims of abuse,"" it would be his task ""to see that justice prevails in the midst of the media wildfire."" He added, ""Fortunately, our justice system requires more than a YouTube video to determine the facts of a case. As we proceed, I am certain that evidence will shed new light on all charges filed by the D.A.'s office against my client."" Collins said Cardosa was grateful for the ""outpouring of support from her family, friends, colleagues, and students during this difficult time."" Earlier, he said Cardosa's legal team planned to challenge the filing against the statute of limitations and challenge the bail motion to reduce the amount from $5 million. But Hall, the district attorney's office spokesman, said there is no statute of limitations in California on the most serious charge -- aggravated sexual assault on a child under 14. After the first woman posted a YouTube video of her accusations in January, another woman came forward. The second alleged victim, now 18, has filed a complaint accusing the Val Verde Unified School District in Perris, California, of negligence. David Ring, lawyer for the older accuser, said, ""She is very gratified that the DA has brought charges against this perpetrator. She hopes justice is done in the criminal case and that Cardosa admits to what she's done, which she already admitted to in the phone call -- that she ruined her childhood."" Cardosa resigned January 17 from her most recent job as an administrator at Alhambra High School in Southern California after the first accusation was uploaded on YouTube, according to the school district. The video features the alleged victim on camera and what is said to be the teacher's voice on a phone conversation. In the video, the teacher can be heard acknowledging the abuse claim. The first alleged victim said the abuse took place ""off and on"" for her between the ages of 12 and 18. She said she didn't come forward as a teenager because the teacher had brainwashed her. ""She told me that my family didn't love me. She told me that nobody cared about me and that she was the only one that loved me and the only one that was there for me,"" she said. ""She made me believe that she was my only friend, and that I could trust her."" The alleged victim said she didn't want a physical relationship, but she said the teacher threatened her multiple times. ""She said that she would kill herself if I ever left. And I believed that,"" the alleged victim said . CNN's Sonya Hamasaki, Stephanie Elam and Artemis Moshtaghian contributed to this story.","NEW: DA's office: The arraignment is pushed back again, this time to April 18 .

"(CNN) -- Voter turnout was terrible last Tuesday. As President Barack Obama lamented in his post-election press conference Wednesday, two-thirds of voters chose not to vote, making it perhaps the lowest midterm turnout since the 1940s. Conventional wisdom says low turnout favors Republicans, and it did last week. But the days when one party sees low turnout as being in its own interest might be drawing to a close -- and it may be Republicans who will drive the change. First, some context. Midterm electorates are typically smaller, whiter and older than presidential electorates. In recent years, the GOP has worked hard to ensure that its shrinking, white, aging base turns out in disproportionately large numbers. And even though there are plenty of Republican leaders who'd like to see their party become younger and more diverse, the practical pressures of here-and-now politics have led them to go into campaigns with the voters they have, not the ones they wished they had. But on Tuesday, the wishes of those Republicans hoping to expand the base started coming true -- at least on the margins, and enough to suggest a new way forward. While Republicans extended their dominance among older white voters, they also made modest inroads with Latino and Asian-American voters, partly by downplaying the nativist messages of past cycles and partly by exploiting frustration with the Obama administration. Several new-generation black, Hispanic and Asian Republican candidates were also elected across the country. Meanwhile, GOP leaders such as Sen. Rand Paul have been engaging millennial voters on campuses and elsewhere with an unapologetic libertarianism that resonates with some young people. As a result, it's possible for a smart Republican to see 2014 not only as a win, but as a hint of how the party could prevail in 2016 as well. To put it simply, the GOP might soon see it as in its own interest to boost turnout among young voters and voters of color, instead of writing them off or, as still happens too often, blocking them from voting at all. This would be a major departure, to be sure. We're still a long way from a heartfelt and well-executed effort to expand the GOP demographic base. And even if party leaders want it, there are still too many voters who vote Republican precisely because they fear or blame the very people the leaders want to bring into the tent. Still, it's at least becoming possible now. There is an opening among Latino, Asian and young voters. And it would be fantastic for the country if Republicans pushed to exploit that opening. That may sound funny coming from a Democrat. My party in the 21st century has become the default choice for voters shorthanded as the ""rising American electorate,"" which is to say, young and nonwhite voters. I recognize that an effort by the GOP to grab a chunk of that electorate would be a challenge to my party. As an American though, I'd love to see it happen. I'd love to see young and nonwhite voters tell candidates from both parties that they are not to be taken for granted, and I'd love for each party to try to outdo the other not just in raising money but in raising turnout across the board. It would be great for the country if both parties in earnest developed new policy ideas that address the hopes and dreams of millennial voters and voters of color. This means not simply trying to win by carving off slightly more than half of those voters that do turn out, but trying to build true majorities of all the voters. Weeks before the midterm elections, Rock the Vote released a video that went instantly viral called ""Turn Out for What?"" With rap stars and other celebrities, it drove home the message that there were numerous issues, from same-sex marriage to marijuana to student debt, that should drive young people to turn out and vote. In the end, of course, only a fraction of them did. ""Turn out for what?"" can be also read as a cynical statement. As in, ""Why bother?"" If we're ever going to change the ""Why bother"" attitude, it's going to be because both parties are actively fighting for voters not just in their currently defined bases, but in every subgroup. So I hope, for my country, that the party I don't belong to starts investing heavily in appealing to people who don't belong to it either. And I hope, for my country, that members of this rising American electorate start demanding more from both parties before giving away their votes, either by casting predictable ballots or not casting them at all. I loved the Rock the Vote campaign. But true progress will come when we won't need chiding, even fun chiding, to get out and participate, when both parties will be outracing each other to bring more people into the voting booth because they'll have nothing to fear from elections that are truly representative. Let's turn out for that.","Midterm voter turnout last week perhaps was lowest since 1940s .

"(CNN) -- She's mentioned by name only once in 85 pages, but former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was back under a Republican microscope after a Senate report on the killings of four Americans in Libya. ""Sounds like the 2016 presidential race has now started,"" Sen. Dan Coats, R-Indiana, told CNN. Clinton leads early polls of potential Democratic presidential contenders. GOP leaders quickly focused their fire on her after the Senate Intelligence Committee concluded that the 2012 assault on the U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi was ""likely preventable"" based on known security shortfalls and prior warnings. U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, State Department computer specialist Sean Smith and security contractors Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods were killed in that attack. The Senate report spread the blame between the State Department and the intelligence community. State Department officials should have beefed up security in Libya's second-largest city because of general warnings that U.S. personnel were at risk. The intelligence community could have flagged potential threats on ""extremist-affiliated social media,"" the report says. In addition, the report says intelligence officials inaccurately reported that a protest might have led to the attack, and took too long to correct the erroneous reports -- ""which caused confusion and influenced the public statements of policymakers."" It follows a 2013 report by the State Department's Accountability Review Board, which resulted in the reassignment of four State Department officials. But questions around security and intelligence as well as the changing explanation in the days that followed the attack -- which occurred in the heat of the 2012 presidential race -- led to allegations of a cover-up and repeated Republican calls for more explanation from the Obama administration. Wednesday's report did little to quiet them. ""It raises questions that I think need to be answered before we can put this to rest,"" said Coats, one of five Republicans who blasted Clinton in a statement of ""additional views"" tacked onto the end of the report -- the only part of the document that identifies her directly. They argued that as secretary of state, Clinton bore ""ultimate accountability"" for security at the Benghazi mission, ""and we believe there should be a full examination of her role in these events, including on the night of the attacks."" ""In this case, there are a lot of finger pointing elsewhere as to failures of the process and failures of the agency, et cetera,"" Coats said. ""But no one really has stood up and said, 'I take responsibility for this.' That's important. The American people want justice done here and closure to this issue."" Clinton, who left office in February 2013, has said she accepts responsibility for the Benghazi deaths. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a Clinton adviser told CNN, ""Four Americans lost their lives. We have never and will never approach this tragedy through the prism of politics. If others continue to do so for their own gain, they're going to have to do it without us."" But Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, told CNN that Clinton ""has to clear the air on Benghazi"" if she wants to be president. ""She has a lot of accomplishments. She's a very accomplished woman. But, under her leadership, the consulate became a death trap,"" said Graham, who doesn't sit on the Intelligence Committee. And Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said, ""The American people hold all of us accountable who are in responsibility. She should be held accountable."" But comments like that drew a sharp response from the committee's chairwoman, California Democrat Dianne Feinstein, on Thursday. In a statement issued by her office, Feinstein said claims that the report blames Clinton for the Benghazi deaths are ""patently false,"" and that the Republican addendum ""unfairly criticizes Secretary Clinton."" Wednesday, Feinstein told CNN's The Situation Room that ""it's interesting that the first thing out of the box is something that's political."" And at the White House, spokesman Jay Carney criticized what he called ""a very politicized effort on this that has seen a lot of conspiracy theories floated, reported on as fact, and then debunked."" ""Our interest is in getting those who are responsible, bringing them to justice, and taking the steps necessary to ensure that this kind of thing can't happen again or is far less likely to happen again,"" Carney said Thursday. But efforts to bring the perpetrators -- identified as members of a variety of Islamic militant groups, some affiliated with al Qaeda -- to justice have been frustrated by the lack of ""political incentive or will"" by Libyan authorities to prosecute those believed responsible, the Senate report states. In addition, it noted, up to 15 people who had assisted the probe have been killed since September 2012, though it wasn't clear if the deaths were related to the probe. CNN's Elise Labott and Paul Courson contributed to this report.","NEW: Clinton adviser blasts ""the prism of politics"" around Benghazi .

"London (CNN) -- CNN on Thursday welcomed budding journalists and news producers from under-represented backgrounds to experience life in the fast-paced world of the CNN London newsroom. CNN International is a member of the Creative Diversity Network (CDN) and instrumental in creating the first CDN Open Newsroom Day which was designed to give 500 young people with an interest in a career in news the opportunity to spend a day with regional and national newsrooms around the UK. CNN's visitors were shown around the newsroom, guided by the London editorial team. They then researched their own topics before taking to the streets to file their own news reports. CNN International anchors Nina Dos Santos, Max Foster and Hala Gorani were on hand to tell the group about their own careers at CNN, and give an insight into their daily lives. CNN journalists also got involved, tweeting pictures of themselves taken at the outsets of their journalism careers and it was so popular that we are already planning to do it again next year! Adam Dunnakey, one of the organizers of CNN's open newsroom, explained how a television open day was a pivotal moment in his career. ""The 20 people who came to CNN London didn't just get to see, they got to do. ""Opportunities like Open Newsroom aren't just great fun, they can be life changing.

"(CNN) -- The paint is peeling, puddles litter the inside of the building, putrid water lies in what was supposed to be a swimming pool and even the statue of the man who had the vision to build the sports complex is cracked -- a sad and inglorious tribute to Marc-Vivien Foe 10 years to the day after the Cameroonian's tragic death. Once earmarked as a state-of-the-art $10 million sports academy, the only inhabitants today are not the next generation of Indomitable Lions but a handful of squatters and policemen -- with Foe's father funding the latter because of the high risk of theft in this corner of Yaounde. Those are not Martin Foe's only financial concerns because his bitter row with Marc-Vivien's widow Marie-Louise over the distribution of the estate of the two-time African champion, double French league winner and former Premier League star lies at the heart of the complex's decline. With Martin claiming that Marc-Vivien's properties should be returned to his side of the family and the star's wife -- neither relative would speak directly to CNN -- believing she should be the recipient, the duo are at such loggerheads that a resolution seems incredibly remote. It's a dispute made all the more tragic given the former international's body lies in the all-but-abandoned complex. Shortly after the midfielder died of cardiac arrest during a Confederations Cup semi-final on 26 June 2003, Cameroon's government pledged funds to ensure completion of a project started by a man who was posthumously decorated as a Commander of the National Order of Valor. The country's then prime minister laid the medal on top of Foe's coffin as some 3,000 mourners - including further government dignitaries, FIFA president Sepp Blatter and Cameroon's football squad -- gathered at the four-hectare site. But because of the intense familial row -- while a government promise of funds also failed to materialize -- the real legacy of Foe's death is not to be found in a suburb of Cameroon's capital but in the world's international football stadiums instead. ""Foe's death really shook FIFA and what changed was the attitude of the Executive Committee and other decision-makers towards medicine and the health of the players,"" Professor Jiri Dvorak, FIFA's chief medical officer, told CNN from Brazil. ""There were already medical courses in place and we were aware of the issue of cardiac arrest, but that was the extent of what we were doing. But once we experienced it live, in front of rolling TV cameras, we realized the reality of the situation and understood we had to do more. ""It made me certain that prevention was the way to go and so many, many new regulations have been implemented since then to reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death on the pitch."" Medical screening . Football's world governing has acted steadily over the years to try to ensure that there are as few repeats as possible of the awful scenes that were broadcast to millions around the world from Lyon a decade ago. The French city was, ironically, the very one where Foe's registration was kept although English side Manchester City had been keen to sign the tall Cameroonian -- who had been with them on loan the preceding year -- on a permanent basis. They would never get the chance as the then 28-year-old collapsed in the 72nd minute of the semifinal against Colombia with no-one around him. An opponent was the first to notice the seriousness of the situation and unlike the swift treatment given to Bolton Wanderers' Fabrice Muamba at Tottenham Hotspur last year, medical assistance was slow to arrive. Despite attempts to resuscitate him for 45 minutes and the fact that he was still alive when taken to the ground's medical center, Foe died because of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy -- a condition that involves an abnormal thickening of the heart muscle. Those who are prone to the problem are up to five times more likely to suffer a cardiac arrest when exercising intensively than they would be when leading a sedentary lifestyle. As the tributes flooded in for a talented player with terrific stamina and, according to those who knew him, a permanent smile on his face, FIFA reacted by making it mandatory to equip all stadiums hosting international matches with automated external defibrillators. In addition, the organization introduced medical screenings of all players ahead of any FIFA competition -- a policy which was of clear benefit to all the recipients, but especially those from Foe's continent. At the African Under-17 Championship in Algeria, FIFA -- in conjunction with the continental body CAF and the local FA -- medically assessed all 160 players and unwittingly discovered that nearly 70% of the teenagers had never seen a doctor before in their lives. Late last month, FIFA issued all of its 209 member associations a Medical Emergency Bag, one which the global body says is similar to those in use by the American and South African military and which, more importantly, boasts a defibrillator among its contents. However, Dvorak readily concedes that the bag will be largely worthless unless the training of teams' medical personnel is up to scratch. ""It is important that the doctors and paramedics are adequately educated to be able to use it in case of emergency, but we can never guarantee that the right training is being done all around the world,"" said the Czech. ""Definitely at those competitions where we are responsible, like the Confederations Cup here in Brazil, we check that the relevant people are able to understand what they have in their hands -- and how important it is that they know."" All the more so since the first symptom of those suffering hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can sometimes be death itself, while footballers to have died of cardiac issues in recent years form a depressingly long list -- with the cases of Antonio Puerta (Sevilla), Daniel Jarque (Espanyol) and Phil O'Donnell (Motherwell) prominent among them. While the medical measures undertaken by FIFA form part of Foe's legacy, a final chapter continues to play out wherever Cameroon's Indomitable Lions roam. Irreplaceable midfielder . The first team from Africa to reach the World Cup quarterfinals (in 1990), Cameroon were feared at the time of Foe's death -- with the team having added the 2002 Nations Cup to their 2000 title as they became the first to win back-to-back crowns in nearly four decades. Since the death of a central midfielder who has simply proved irreplaceable in the middle -- a box-to-box player with aerial presence and a calming, disciplined demeanor -- Cameroon's footballing fortunes have steadily declined. They have not won a match at the World Cup since Foe's death (missing out on Germany 2006 altogether) nor another African title -- and political rows and team squabbling have meant the four-time continental champions have failed to qualify for the last two Nations Cups. The last month has been indicative of the country's recent woes, with World Cup qualification having hung by a thread until opponents Togo -- who beat Cameroon earlier this month -- were found to have fielded an ineligible player during the qualifier, meaning the Lions may be awarded some fortuitous points instead. At the same time, the football federation chose to re-elect Iya Mohamed as president -- despite the fact he was being detained by local police at the time after being accused of transgressions connected to his role as director-general of the state-owned Cotton Development Company. A once proud game is, in short, something of a mess -- and perhaps the crumbling complex where the patriotic Marc-Vivien Foe lies is a fitting, if sad, reflection of the lamentable state of Cameroonian football today.","26 June 2013 is the10th anniversary of Marc-Vivien Foe's death .

"Reno, Nevada (CNN) -- Sarah Palin warned Monday that the mainstream Republican Party must embrace the core conservative principles of the Tea Party movement or disappear. In comments to CNN at a Tea Party Express rally to kick off its fourth national tour, Palin said the Republican Party machine realizes how the Tea Party movement's ""we the people"" message has resonated on the political right, as well as with independents and moderates. The message emphasizes free market principles and individual and state powers instead of expanded federal powers. ""Heaven forbid the GOP machine strays from this message,"" said the former Alaska governor and unsuccessful Republican vice presidential candidate. ""If so, the GOP is through."" Her comments, in response to the question of whether the Tea Party movement is dividing the Republican Party, showed how Palin and other Tea Party leaders are trying to galvanize the political right by bringing their supporters together with the traditional GOP structures. Tea Party-backed candidates have defeated mainstream Republican candidates, including several congressional incumbents, in several primaries across the country this year. In some cases, the Tea Party victories have harmed Republican chances for victory. For example, Palin backed Christine O'Donnell over nine-term Republican Rep. Mike Castle, a former governor, in Delaware's GOP Senate primary. Castle was considered a likely general election winner, but the primary upset by the inexperienced and controversial O'Donnell now makes a Democratic victory likely in the November 2 vote. In her speech at Monday's rally, Palin said the Republican Party should ""man up"" and support Tea Party candidates such as O'Donnell, who has been criticized by some Republican figures, including longtime strategist Karl Rove. ""The bigwigs in the machine, they're driving me crazy because they're too chicken to support the Tea Party candidates,"" Palin said at Monday's rally. ""The ideas of the Tea Party movement are the American ideals that will put us back to work."" Palin to GOP: 'Man up' She also told the crowd to support Tea Party candidates for the good of America's future. In her comments to CNN, Palin called for Republican moderates and independents to embrace the ""time-tested truths"" of ""commonsense"" conservative principles, but she also noted that ""the planks in the GOP platform really are the strongest, most solid planks to build a strong economy, because it's all about entrepreneurial spirit and equal prosperity and opportunity according to a work ethic."" Her speech Monday followed an appearance Saturday in California with Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele. The Tea Party Express tour, titled ""Liberty at the Ballot Box,"" is the group's fourth since 2009 and their last of the 2010 election cycle. Their prime tactic is to crisscross the country urging voters to oust Democrats from office and purge the Republican Party of members deemed ""RINOs,"" or ""Republicans in Name Only,"" considered not conservative enough. It will make 30 stops over 15 days, ending in Concord, New Hampshire, one day before the critical congressional elections. Monday's crowd was considerably smaller than the last rally Palin kicked off for the Tea Party Express, in Searchlight, Nevada, in March. Palin has lent political star power and considerable time helping to spread the message of Tea Party movement, which includes smaller government, lower taxes, deflating a bloated federal deficit and urging lawmakers toward more faithful adherence to the Constitution. She and other supporters of the movement staunchly support Nevada GOP Senate candidate Sharron Angle in the race against the top Democrat in the Senate: Majority Leader Harry Reid. Polls show the race between the two candidates to be essentially deadlocked. Democrats continue to push their own strategy to smack back the bids of Tea Party candidates. Vice President Joe Biden will campaign for Reid in Reno on Wednesday, and President Barack Obama will appear at fundraisers on Reid's behalf on Friday.","NEW: Palin says the Republican Party is ""through"" if it strays from Tea Party principles .

"Rome, Italy (CNN)  -- The Vatican had praise Saturday for this week's announcement that scientists had created the world's first synthetic cell, calling it an ""interesting result"" that could help cure disease. In an article Saturday, the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano called it ""important research"" and ""the work of high-quality genetic engineering."" But it said the scientists who created the cell had not created life, just ""replaced one of its motors."" The response may appear to mark a turn for the Vatican, but in fact the church does not officially oppose genetic engineering as long as the science avoids embryonic stem cells, cloning or anything else that fiddles too much with the re-creation of human life. ""Genetic engineering can do good: It is enough to think that it could heal chromosome-related diseases,"" the article said. However, scientists must ""join courage with caution,"" it said. ""They touch a very fragile territory where the environment and manipulation play a role that cannot be underestimated,"" the article said. Genetics pioneer J. Craig Venter, who runs an eponymous U.S. institute for genomic research, announced Thursday that he and his team had created artificial life for the first time. Using sequences of genetic code created on a computer, the team assembled a complete DNA of a bacterium and inserted it into a cell of bacteria. The new cell was self-replicating, controlled only by the synthetic genome. ""The weight of the DNA is great, and great are the expectations of genetic science,"" L'Osservatore Romano said. ""Nevertheless, the DNA, even though it is an excellent engine, is not life."" Venter said his team had not created life. ""We created a new cell. It's alive. But we didn't create life from scratch,"" he said. Venter said the discovery would help give science new tools for a range of applications, from converting carbon dioxide into fuel and creating new food substances to creating new vaccines to treat diseases. The breakthrough will stimulate discussion about the possibilities, Venter told CNN. He said his next step would be to ""see if we can create some of these cures for the planet.""

"(CNN) -- Joss Christensen led a U.S. clean sweep in freestyle skiing slopestyle at the Sochi Winter Olympics Thursday before paying an emotional tribute to his late father. The 22-year-old Christensen dominated both the heats and finals, producing the two best runs on each occasion, to take the gold. With Gus Kenworthy taking silver and Nicholas Goepper winning bronze, it was an all-American podium. Christensen, who struggled to find his form after his father James passed away last August, came to the Games as an outsider and as the last pick on the U.S. team, but with scores of 95.80 and 93.80 in the final the Games debutant was an emphatic victor. But his first thoughts were with his dad. ""I wish he was here and I hope he is smiling down on me. I hope I made him proud. I did it for him,"" he said. Christensen was also congratulated by Sage Kotsenburg, who won the first gold of the Sochi Games, taking the snowboard version of slopestyle Saturday. ""It's hard not to feel a lump in your throat when you here Joss' story,"" he said. The United States has proved dominant in slopestyle, which is making it's debut in the Winter Olympics, winning three of the four golds on offer plus a silver. German joy in luge . Meanwhile, German domination in the luge is total as the team completed a clean sweep of gold medals by storming to victory in the first-ever relay event at the Games. Women's champion Natalie Geisenberger, men's gold medalist Felix Loch and doubles winners Tobias Wendl and Tobias Arlt combined for Germany's seventh gold to date in Sochi. Nicknamed the ""Bayern Express,"" the team proved unbeatable and finished over a second clear of silver medalist Russia, with Latvia in bronze. China makes skating history . But there was an upset in the women's 1,000 meters speed skating competition as Chinese outsider Zhang Hong beat her more established rivals to claim her country's first victory in the event. Zhang clocked one minute 14.02 seconds as an early starter and had to sit while 11 further pairs of skaters attempted to beat her time at the Adler Arena oval. Ireen Wust of the Netherlands, the 3,000m gold medalist, came closest, but was over half a second slower in taking the silver. Fellow Dutch competitor Margot Boer took the bronze while fancied American pair Heather Richardson and world record-holder Brittany Bowe were only seventh and eighth. China also came out on top in a chaotic women's 500m short track speed skating final, which was marred by a three-skater pileup. Five-time world champion Li Jianrou stayed upright to take the gold but admitted fortune had been on her side. ""I believe it's a miracle. I always believe in myself. I skated like I do in my daily training. I'm lucky to get this gold medal,"" she said. Britain's Elise Christie crossed the line second but was disqualified after officials ruled she had caused the crash. Italy's Arianna Fontana, the bronze medalist from Vancouver in 2010, took silver with Park Seung-Hi of South Korea in bronze. Bjoerndalen upstaged by new biathlon star . Martin Fourcade made it double gold in Sochi as he followed his 12.5 km pursuit triumph with victory in the 20 km individual biathlon event. The 25-year-old is the first French athlete to win two golds at a Games since alpine skiing great Jean-Claude Killy in 1968. Germany's Erik Lesser took silver and Russian Evgeniy Garanichev won bronze on his 26th birthday, but there was disappointment for Norwegian veteran Ole Einar Bjoerndalen. The 40-year-old failed in his bid to win Winter Olympic record of 13 medals when he finished in 34th after problems in the shooting section, where he picked four penalties. ""I wanted to show my rivals that I'm still angry,"" said Fourcade after his triumph, when asked if he was ""focused"" or ""angry."" On a day when six golds were awarded, Justyna Kowalczyk of Poland won the women' s 10km classic style event in nordic skiing. Kowalczyk, who started favorite, finished nearly 20 seconds clear of Charlotte Kalla of Sweden, with Therese Johaug of Norway in third place. Away from the medal action, Russia's ice hockey men opened their campaign with a 5-2 win over Slovenia, while the United States thrashed Slovakia 7-1 and defending champions Canada beat Norway 3-1. But there was disappointment for the host nation when figure skating hero Yvegeny Plushenko dramatically withdrew just before he was due to compete in the men's figure skating short program. The 31-year-old had been personally congratulated by Russian President Vladimir Putin after helping his country to win the team gold Sunday. A two-time Olympic champion, he was bidding to become the first man to win five figure skating medals at the Winter Games.","American debutant Joss Christensen wins freestyle skiing slopestyle gold .

"(CNN) -- Two people were killed and 22 injured when an overpass bridge under construction collapsed Thursday in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, one of the host cities for the ongoing World Cup, firefighters said on Twitter. Two buses were also damaged in the collapse, said CNN affiliate TV Record, which cited firefighters. Images that circulated on social media showed a bus trapped by the collapsed concrete structure. Another photo showed at least one car was crushed . The overpass traverses a major thoroughfare and is almost four miles from the 58,170-seat Estadio Mineirao, where some World Cup games are being played in Belo Horizonte. The overpass was supposed to have been completed in time for the World Cup, which began last month and continues through next weekend. Killed were Hanna Cristina Santos, 24, and Charlys Federico Moreira do Nascimento, 25, firefighters said. The latter died in a vehicle, according to firefighters. Brazil's preparations for the World Cup have been controversial. Some critics say the spending was lavish at the expense of schools, public services and hospitals. Also, many of the country's 12 venues struggled to meet construction schedules in time for the games, and several workers died on World Cup stadium construction sites. Belo Horizonte will host Tuesday's semifinal match between the winner of the France-Germany match and the winner of the Brazil-Colombia game. The city has so far hosted five World Cup games since June 14, when Colombia beat Greece 3-0. Tuesday's game will be the last to be hosted by the city in this year's World Cup. The U.S. team did not compete there this year. Most recently, Brazil and Chile played to a 1-1 tie in Belo Horizonte on Saturday. Estadio Mineirao is one of the most historic venues in Brazilian soccer and was overhauled for the games: The pitch surface was lowered, accessibility improved, and a system installed to capture and store rainwater for reuse. The facility's official name is Estadio Governador Magalhaes Pinto, but it's commonly known as the Mineirao. The stadium is home to Atletico Mineiro and Cruzeiro, both former national champions in Brazil. CNN's Pierre Meilhan and Elwyn Lopez contributed to this report.

"(CNN) -- Childhood is confusing. It's difficult to fully understand things at the best of times and, occasionally, you'll experience something that is unlike anything that you've experienced thus far. One such example came early for me. During our regular family drives, my father would play a cassette from an old BBC radio program that he'd first listened to as a kid growing up in the 1960s. The show was called ""Round The Horne"" and it featured a couple of camp homosexual characters who went by the names of Julian and Sandy -- played by Hugh Paddick and Kenneth Williams. The pair were out-of-work actors who could be found running various fashionable and niche enterprises that always started with the word ""bona"" -- such as ""Bona Films."" The sketches usually began with a very middle-class Kenneth Horne knocking on a shop door and asking ""Hello, anybody there?"" before Paddick answered ""Ooh, hello! I'm Julian and this is my friend Sandy!"" The audience loved them and their appearances became a highlight of the show thanks to a mixture of ""Polari"" language -- gay slang -- and ever more risque double entendres. Perhaps their best-known sketch is when Horne is looking for legal representation and pops into a little shop called ""Bona Law."" Horne: ""Can you help me? I've erred."" Sandy: ""Well, we've all erred, ducky. I mean, it's common knowledge, ennit, Jule?"" Horne: ""Will you take my case?"" Julian: ""Well, it depends on what it is. We've got a criminal practice that takes up most of our time."" Horne: ""Yes, but apart from that, I need legal advice."" This was my first exposure to homosexuality and, because it was through humor, ably explained by my father, it meant that the only confusion around the subject came as I wondered why the kids in my school playground called each other ""bender"" or ""queer."" As a 10 or 11-year-old kid, you ask yourself very obvious and basic questions about the things that you're unsure about. Why are the kids calling each other these names when the kid in question isn't funny? Gays are funny, aren't they? It was, of course, down to an ignorance brought about by a lack of exposure at my age. As you build up more encounters, so you build up a more complete picture of something. But the older I get, I do find myself continually amazed by the amount of people I meet who are still ignorant or underexposed to a whole range of things. It isn't necessarily their fault but it has a profound knock-on effect nonetheless. The fact is that there are millions of gay people all over the world and if you're a fairly relaxed person like me, well, that's just the way it is. Big deal. I'm not a religious fellow in any way whatsoever so, where homosexuality is concerned at least, Jesus Christ is not my barometer. Then again, maybe I'm the ignorant one. Until I typed that last sentence, that thought had never occurred to me. For some people, it is a big deal and I only really came into contact with that once I became a footballer. Up until then, my life had been fairly colorful, to say the least. In football, homosexual players remain scarce. There have been a couple of players who have ""come out,"" most recently Robbie Rogers, the former Leeds United and United States forward, who took to his website to announce that he was gay ... and promptly retired from the beautiful game at the tender age of 25. It was unfortunate for football and the gay community -- football is in desperate need of a gay icon -- yet was completely understandable. ""They (the players) often don't mean what they say,"" Rogers said. ""It's that pack mentality. They're trying to get a laugh, they're trying to be the top guy. But it's brutal. It's like high school again -- on steroids."" Rogers was talking about a changing room that doesn't know that it has a gay player in its midst. But I'm as certain as I can be that a changing room that does know that it has a gay player in its ranks would be a very safe place for a gay footballer. That pack mentality works the other way, too. The group protects its own. It doesn't matter whether you are white, black, straight or gay. I'm as certain of that as I can be. Sure, players will talk behind each other's backs, not necessarily in a disparaging way, but -- to the outside world at least -- the team is a united front. There are no veils, curtains or walls in a changing room because every team has a player who will call a spade a spade. Somebody who will point out that the king has no clothes on and, with one not-so-subtle comment, remove the awkwardness of almost any situation. The first time my roommate met the man at our club who has one hand, he said to him: ""Are you right-handed or left-handed?"" It was the ice-breaker everybody needed, especially for the man in question, who said that the worst thing about his disability is when people walk around him on eggshells. But it is difficult, if not impossible, for even the tightest of squads to protect a player from the taunts of tens of thousands of fans. Or, for that matter, even just a few people. As recently as 2008, a section of Tottenham Hotspur fans sang the following words to Sol Campbell as he lined up for Portsmouth against his former club: . ""Sol, Sol, wherever you may be . Not long now until lunacy . And we won't give a f**k . When you're hanging from a tree . You're a Judas c**t with HIV."" It's easy to see why Robbie Rogers gave the answer he did when a journalist asked him what he thought the reaction might be if he were to line up for Leeds against, say, Millwall. ""Woah!"" Rogers exclaimed. ""I can't even think about that."" I can tell you now, it would be horrendous for him. You know as well as I do that the abuse a homosexual player would receive from ""fans"" throughout the land would be intolerable. That isn't to say that it wouldn't ease off, but would you want to be the player who goes first? On England's south coast in Brighton -- an area with a large gay community -- the football team and its fans take a fair amount of stick both during home matches and at away grounds. I've heard ""fans"" singing to their counterparts: ""Who's the f****t in the pink?"" And once during a home match: ""Does your boyfriend know you're here?"" -- which, I won't lie, made me smile because of the laughter it generated among the traveling Brighton contingent. Interestingly, there are few, if any, headlines written about it either as a social commentary or by a journalist going for a bit of sensationalism. However, Brighton currently occupy a playoff berth in the Championship and, should they win promotion to the Premier League, I guarantee you that the headlines will begin in earnest next season -- something that will force the authorities to take a very public, zero-tolerating stance. Perhaps that will turn out to be the first step on the ladder to a player ""coming out."" Julian and Sandy broke down many of the social barriers that existed in post-war UK at a time when homosexuality was still illegal. It stands up because the writing is exceptional and the risque tone of it is expertly delivered on stage. Kenneth Williams, in particular, seemed to go about his role with such relish that it almost sounded as if he'd been freed from some terrible secret. Many years later, after his death, his private diaries would reveal a man at tremendous odds with his own sexuality. Imagine that; imagine not being able to live out the true meaning of your life with the same freedom as most other people. Imagine having to keep your true identity a secret. I wouldn't wish that on anybody.","Homosexual players in football remain scarce with Robbie Rogers the latest to come out and then retire .

"(CNN) -- Sepp Blatter once suggested women footballers should wear tighter shorts -- now his organization, FIFA, has been accused of blatant sexism in its selection of the person to lead an investigation into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. The investigation and subsequent report by American lawyer Michael Garcia, head of FIFA's investigative chamber of the ethics committee, has become emblematic of the world governing body's reluctance to embrace a greater degree of transparency following criticism of the way FIFA is run. FIFA president Blatter doesn't want the report published because he fears it will contravene FIFA's privacy laws, though Garcia and others such as the head of European soccer UEFA president Michel Platini have indicated they'd like it to be made public. Now three former members of the Independent Governance Committee (IGC), the body tasked with working on reform proposals and drawing up a shortlist of candidates to lead the investigation into the bids for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, which were awarded to Russia and Qatar, have told CNN that FIFA officials insisted that a woman should not be nominated for the role Garcia eventually assumed. According to two of those former IGC members, Garcia, who recently delivered his long-awaited report, was not even on the original shortlist of candidates to lead the investigation. Alexandra Wrage, who left the IGC in April last year after becoming frustrated with the lack of progress being made, recalls the occasion in 2012 where she was left stunned by suggestions that the committee should not consider any female candidates for the lead investigator role. Sitting in the dining hall with two IGC colleagues during FIFA's Congress in Budapest that year, she claims she was approached by two senior FIFA employees. ""I turned from the group to face them and one of the men told me, 'Stop putting women forward for these positions.' He told me they would not be acceptable and that I was fighting the wrong battle,"" Wrage said. ""I didn't really take in what he was saying and then it hit me. ""I said, 'Did you really just say that?' I was startled. They started to elaborate on their views and gave me more and more details. ""I was the only woman at the table and they were directing their views just at me."" Guillermo Jorge, a fellow member of the IGC was also present alongside Wrage when a discussion was had over the possibility of female nominations. He said the FIFA officials did not approach her and tell her to stop putting forth women, but confirmed to CNN that the two men said that it would be very unlikely that Exco would appoint a woman because FIFA is still very unbalanced in gender terms. When CNN then approached Mark Pieth -- who chaired the IGC until its final report in April 2014 to discuss the allegation -- he said: ""It is true that FIFA was not keen to elect women into these positions."" When CNN contacted FIFA with the allegation, a spokesperson reiterated the organization's support of women. ""At the time the President has explained that the candidate would have the full support of the football world,"" the spokesperson said. ""It is about acceptance. Unfortunately, a female may find it difficult to lead an investigation in certain parts of the world. ""That's unfortunate but you have to look at what will be acceptable to the majority of people within football throughout the world. ""The investigator would be working at all levels of football in dealing with ethics. ""The President hopes that there will be more women in leading positions in football. ""There are already three women on the Exco (Executive Committee) and that shows FIFA's commitment to women and their importance."" Last month, Blatter spoke of FIFA's ""exemplary organization in ethics"" while addressing the World Summit on Ethics in Sports. But FIFA is facing more questions, with the process through which Garcia was appointed as the lead investigator under scrutiny. How the former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York came to write the report is something of a conundrum, given he was not included on the original shortlist of candidates to lead the investigation. A FIFA spokesperson confirmed to CNN that when a shortlist of eight names -- which were compiled in order of ranking -- was submitted to football's world governing body in May 2012, Garcia's name was absent. The names, which were submitted for the investigative and adjudicatory positions by the IGC before Wrage was approached in Budapest, included four men and four women -- all of whom worked in either the judicial or investigative sector. The choice of Garcia was met with surprise by those at the IGC given the nature of their recommendations, with chairman Pieth suggesting that the New York prosecutor was not his first choice. The credentials of Garcia, who worked in the last Bush administration, are impressive, but Pieth's preference to lead the investigation was Argentine prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo, whose nomination was vetoed by the country's president Cristina Fernandez de Kircher. The second-choice candidate was unable to take up the role because of illness and has since passed away, according to Pieth. According to a FIFA spokesperson, the IGC was not the only body to offer potential nominations for the role of lead investigator. Pieth says the nomination of Garcia came through the secretary general of Interpol Ronald Noble. Garcia, who once worked as vice-president of the Americas on Interpol's executive committee, currently works in New York as a partner at Kirkland & Ellis LLP. FIFA and Interpol, the world's largest police organization, enjoy a partnership which stretches back to 2011. The 10-year agreement, which is worth €20 million ($25 million) and was set up to combat match fixing, has helped to create a dedicated sports integrity unit in Singapore which opened on Tuesday. An Interpol spokesman confirmed that while the two bodies do enjoy a close relationship, Interpol did not make the appointment of Garcia -- though he commented that ""FIFA could find no better man or woman to discharge the duties assigned to Mr. Garcia."" When asked whether Interpol had received any specific instructions over the gender of candidates, the spokesman replied: ""When it comes to promoting gender equality, Interpol has led by example. ""The world police body's president is a woman. Its cabinet director and head of its global awareness initiative, Turn Back Crime, is a woman. The head of Interpol's National Central Bureau and Regional Police Services unit is a woman. And one of its key Sports Integrity managers is a woman."" The controversy over Garcia's appointment comes in the wake of his statement, published last week, which called on FIFA to publish his report in full. Such a move is unlikely. Hans-Joachim Eckert, who presides over the adjudicatory arm of FIFA's ethics committee, told reporters earlier this month that only his findings would be published and not Garcia's report. That move was met with condemnation by some FIFA Executive Committee members. Sunil Gulati, the president of U.S. Soccer, has urged for the report to be published, as have FIFA vice-presidents Prince Ali bin al-Hussein from Jordan and Jim Boyce of Northern Ireland. ""Given the limited role Mr. Hans-Joachim Eckert envisions for the Adjudicatory Chamber, I believe it is now necessary for the FIFA Executive Committee to authorize the appropriate publication of the Report on the Inquiry into the 2018/2022 FIFA World Cup Bidding Process,"" read Garcia's statement. ""Publication would be consistent with statements made by a number of Executive Committee members, with the view recently expressed by Independent Governance Committee Chair Mark Pieth, and with the goals of the reform process."" His call appears to have fallen on deaf ears, with Blatter insisting he has not had any contact with Garcia. ""The only contact we have had with the president of the (ethics committee) investigatory chamber has been his press releases that we have received in FIFA,"" Blatter told reporters. ""But we have not received any demands or requests from Mr. Garcia to speak to us, or to ask that we should make a decision on this report and to publish this report, and to change the confidentiality which is in the code of ethics of FIFA."" Blatter's stance has been supported by FIFA's legal director Marco Villiger, who said that witness confidentiality could prove difficult to sustain if the report was published. ""The code of ethics is based on certain principles, one of which is confidentiality,"" Villiger told reporters. ""Cooperation between witnesses and the ethics committee is based on confidentiality, if not perhaps certain witnesses, whistleblowers or other parties might not cooperate to such an extent,"" he said, adding that 75 witnesses had been heard during Garcia's investigation. CNN contacted Garcia's office in New York to ask whether it could answer questions relating to his omission from the original list, his recommendation by Interpol and the gender-specific allegations. A spokesman for Garcia said all inquiries should be made to FIFA.","Female candidates not considered for lead investigative role .

"(CNN) -- House Republicans won't support raising the federal government's borrowing limit without new spending cuts from the Obama administration, and the White House risks an unprecedented U.S. default by refusing, House Speaker John Boehner said Sunday. Speaking six days into a partial government shutdown and 11 days before the Treasury Department expects to hit its statutory debt ceiling, Boehner told ABC's ""This Week"" that he wants ""a serious conversation"" about spending, but no tax increases. Asked if the United States would default on debt payments unless President Barack Obama makes concessions, Boehner said, ""That's the path we're on."" ""The votes are not in the House to pass a clean debt limit"" -- one with no conditions attached -- ""and the president is risking default by not having a conversation with us,"" said Boehner, R-Ohio. But speaking on CNN's State of the Union, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said Congress is ""playing with fire"" by threatening to leave the U.S. government unable to pay its creditors -- a risk he called ""unthinkable."" ""We've never gotten to the point where the United States government has operated without the ability to borrow,"" Lew said. ""It's very dangerous. It's reckless, because the reality is, there are no good choices if we run out of borrowing capacity and we run out of cash."" Lew said the government has been managing to make payments since May by shifting money around, but it will run out of those options on October 17. Unless Congress votes to raise the debt ceiling, the federal government will be left with ""a very, very short window of time"" before it would have to stop cutting checks for Social Security recipients or disabled veterans and would undermine the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, he said. What's up with the debt ceiling? In the 2011 debt-ceiling standoff, Congress and the administration agreed to $2 trillion in across-the-board spending cuts over a decade. Though default was narrowly averted, the crisis spurred one of the top three bond-rating houses, Standard and Poor's, to cut the U.S. credit rating for the first time. Government offices across the country shut down Tuesday after Republicans in the House held up the passage of a temporary spending bill, demanding changes or delays to Obama's signature health care law. More than 800,000 federal workers have been on unpaid leave since then. A CBS poll released last week shows a 72% majority of Americans disapprove of the government shutdown, with more Americans blaming GOP lawmakers than Obama. But Boehner told ABC he doesn't have the votes to end the standoff without the Republican conditions on the Affordable Care Act, widely nicknamed ""Obamacare."" Complete coverage: Health care in America . ""I have 233 Republicans in the House, and you've never seen a more dedicated group of people who are thoroughly concerned about the future of our country,"" he said. ""They believe that Obamacare, all these regulations coming out of the administration, are threatening the future for our kids and our grandkids. It is time for us to stand and fight."" Obama and his Democratic allies in Congress say all Boehner has to do is to bring to the floor a Senate-approved measure that temporarily funds the government, let Democrats and a handful of moderate Republicans vote for it, and the standoff ends. But after similar rounds of brinksmanship over the last increase in the debt ceiling, in 2011, and the expiration of the Bush tax cuts in December, the administration has refused to make new concessions to Republicans. ""In 2011, there was a very dangerous turn in the political debate in Washington,"" Lew said. ""You had the same 50 to 100 members who were really willing to default if they didn't get their way. I've been through a lot of budget debates. I've been through a lot of debt ceiling debates. Never did I hear people who said, 'If it don't get my way, it's better to default.' That's not acceptable now."" House Republicans have responded by passing limited spending bills aimed at restoring funds to popular agencies, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs or the National Institutes of Health. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has refused to consider them, demanding that Republicans agree to fund government operations in full -- leading Republicans to blame the president and Reid, D-Nevada, for the shutdown. Don't want to raise the debt ceiling? Get ready for austerity . Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a tea party-backed Republican seen as the architect of the new impasse, told CNN that many previous Congresses have attached conditions to debt-ceiling increases and accused Obama of hyping the risks of a default. He said Republicans should demand ""some significant structural plan and reduce government spending"" as a condition of raising the borrowing limit, as well as ""ways to mitigate the harms from Obamacare."" After soaring to more than $1.4 trillion in 2009, the annual federal budget deficit was expected to shrink below $650 billion in 2013, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. But the total federal debt is nearly $17 trillion and is expected to go up by another $6 trillion by 2023, the CBO predicts. Among the reasons for the shrinking deficits are increased tax collections since January, when Bush-era tax cuts for top earners and a temporary cut in Social Security withholding were allowed to expire. Boehner said that's why he won't accept tax increases in any deal. ""The president got $650 billion of new revenues on January the first ... Now, it's time to talk about the spending problem,"" he said. CNN's Dana Davidsen contributed to this report.","Default? ""That's the path we're on,"" House speaker tells ABC .

"(CNN) -- Meriem Ben Salah's 2-month-old will never know his mother's Tunisia. He won't play in a neighborhood where government minders are lurking and watching. He won't have to praise and thank the president before giving a book report. He won't fear talking about politics, afraid that he'll say something the regime doesn't like. ""My son represents the new Tunisia,"" Ben Salah, a Tunisian native, recently told CNN. ""I will tell him what I had to do and what I grew up with and he'll understand that now there is no fear. Fear left with Ben Ali. May he and that fear never come back."" A year ago, the 28-year-old posted an iReport about what it was like to grow up in Tunisia under former President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. As she wrote, Tunisia was in the throws of a historic revolution, a movement that would spread throughout the Middle East and North Africa. The movement, known as the Arab Spring, was born in Tunisia with a street vendor's self-immolation last year on December 17. Mohamed Bouazizi was reportedly pushed to such extraordinary ends after a municipal official and her aides were alleged to have harassed and humiliated him, and confiscated his goods. Tunisians viewed Bouazizi's act to be the ultimate protest against corruption in Ben Ali's government that they blamed for high unemployment and a lack of speech and political freedom. Throngs of Tunisians took to the streets demanding the ouster of Ben Ali who became president in 1987. Following the 28-day Tunisian revolt that toppled Ben Ali, revolt spread in other countries: Egypt and the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak. The civil war in Libya and death of Moammar Gadhafi. Continued protests in countries such as Yemen and Bahrain. And a series of bloody demonstrations in Syria. WHO'S GONE AND WHO'S HOLDING ONTO POWER? ""To know that the Arab Spring started in Tunisia is just something that warms my heart. It fills me with a love of my country that I thought I would not feel because it was so hard there for many years,"" Salah says. ""I am so glad that tyrant is gone."" Ben Ali resigned and fled to Saudi Arabia in middle January 2011. A Tunisian military court in late November sentenced him in absentia to five years in prison for his role in a 1991 case in which 17 servicemen were accused of plotting a coup against his regime, the state-run Tunisian News Agency reported. Salah will travel to Tunisia with her baby in late December to celebrate. Salah has been pursuing a doctorate in mechanical engineering in California, and wasn't in Tunisia for the protests. But she communicated frequently on the phone and over Skype with her parents during the demonstrations. Her family lives in the same town where she was raised, in Le Kram, a 15-minute drive from the presidential palace near Tunis, the capital. She recalled to CNN this week the thrilling phone and Skype conversations she had with her family when the protests were happening. ""The first conversation with my family -- we talked for so long because we were so excited,"" she recalls. ""We were just shouting, a lot of relatives jumping in to say something. It was odd because there were curfews in Le Kram and Tunis, and my parents were telling me that the neighbors were protecting their houses because the police weren't working. But no one was stealing or hurting each other."" Salah's father would occasionally interrupt during the calls, afraid that their conversations were being monitored by the government. ""He would say, 'Let's not talk. Maybe this is dangerous. We shouldn't,'"" she remembers. ""And yes, it was scary a little but we were all too excited. It was joy, relief, no fear at all."" Salah said her friends and family say that when Ben Ali was ousted, change occurred almost immediately. They were small and slow changes in the way people lived, but they were deeply meaningful. ""My family would say that they heard people talking in the streets and before you just didn't talk to anyone because you didn't want to be overheard saying something against Ben Ali,"" she says. ""Now you can go to a coffee shop and hear people for the first time talking politics. They just talk and talk politics even if they don't understand it because they are so excited to have this freedom."" Salah's own family enjoyed these new political freedoms. During the October election in Tunisia, she supported one party while her parents supported another and they often talked openly about their different opinions. In December, Tunisia's new president, Moncef Marzouki, was sworn in. The veteran human rights activist, who had been imprisoned during Ben Ali's regime, was elected by an Islamist-dominated parliament, the Constituent Assembly. ""For people in the West, they may not understand what a big deal that is,"" Salah says. ""Tunisians understand it and that's what really matters. It will take time to live in freedom and to have democracy. I can't wait for my son to understand that one day.""","On December 17, 2010, a street vendor set himself on fire to protest government .

"(CNN) -- At least 300 people were killed and 700 injured during the Tunisian uprising, a top U.N. human rights expert said Saturday. Juan Mendez, who is in the north African nation this week to study issues facing the interim government, was briefed by a fact-finding commission set up to deal with accusations of human rights abuses since December 17. He said he expects the death toll to climb as the group continues its investigation. Mendez is the United Nations' special rapporteur on torture. He compiles reports and presents them to the U.N. Protests in Tunisia erupted late last year. Fed up with corruption, unemployment and escalating prices of food, people began demonstrating en masse after the self-immolation suicide of a fruit cart vendor in December. The popular protests led to the resignation of the long-time president in January, prompting a wave of unrest across the Arab world. Mendez' visit marks the first official visit to Tunisia by a U.N. independent human rights expert since the creation of the interim government. He arrived in Tunisia on May 15 and is expected to leave Sunday.","The death toll is expected to rise, says the U.N. expert on torture .

"(CNN) -- Some 100 years ago, a woman in Pittsburgh or St. Denis in France or Petrograd, Russia, might have awakened at dawn, while her young children slept, to prepare for her first shift at a nearby munitions factory. Her husband, off fighting in World War I, had left her to test the limits of her own physical ability, as she provided food, shelter, warmth for her family, sometimes confronting great physical danger at work -- perhaps, for example, hanging suspended to load powerful explosives into the shells that other women had produced. When her work day was done, she went looking for food to buy, often standing in line for hours for scarce basic goods, scrounged for hard-to-come-by fuel to feed the furnace and cooked dinner. She washed the children, put them to bed, cleaned up and wrote a letter to her husband, keeping her worry off the page, before sleeping a few hours. And then she got up and did it again. A century ago, as nations and empires began mobilizing to send 65 million men to war, millions of women across the globe moved to fill in the holes created in civilian society. From Britain to Bosnia to Baghdad, across the United States and Europe and India and Africa, women would become single heads of household in unprecedented numbers. They would serve directly on the battlefields as nurses and ambulance drivers and cooks. Yet they also had to keep their nations' home fronts running, moving into ""men's"" jobs, from smelting iron, to driving streetcars, to plowing fields -- as well as working to administer new public and private organizations in support of the war. How a century-old war affects you . The war changed life for women, and it changed the women themselves. When men returned from war, they inevitably tried to reassert their dominance in family and society. But their own broken conditions and circumstances at home challenged these attempts. Women once again had to navigate a tricky terrain laid by men. Yet women had displayed to the world and to themselves their competence in ""total war."" Indeed, the war created a lasting legacy for women, marked by new political rights in many countries -- and marked also by widespread and enduring anxiety over rising feminine power. In 1914, women were not new to the paid workforce. Individual industrial jobs were often considered as specifically for women or for men; entire industries, such as textiles, were ""women's industries,"" while men dominated in metal forges and machine factories. While wealthier women continued to shun paid work, by the turn of the century, lower-middle-class women had begun moving heavily into positions as clerks and secretaries, and women remained central to farming labor. But with the declaration of war, economic shifts and official pressure pushed them increasingly into war production and into ""men's"" jobs (even as, in France, authorities contradicted themselves and confused women by urging them rather to stay at home and have more babies). If only 170,000 women in Britain worked in metal factories on the eve of war, by its end in 1918, there were nearly 600,000. In the United States and Great Britain, women confronted wartime shortages of food and housing. As they took on jobs outside the home, many relied on irregular child care or were forced to leave children without care. While, as in other combatant countries, American women generally strove to ""do their part"" for the war effort and accepted official assignments of war-related work, from factory work to food distribution, some balked at having to ""register"" with authorities. How World War I gave us 'cooties' British propaganda posters declaring soldiers' dependence on female munitions workers gave women a sense that their labor contributions would be important and acknowledged. Yet, even as women munitions workers faced heavy labor and harsh conditions -- along with danger such as in the Barnbow National Factory explosion of 1916 near Leeds, England, that killed 35 -- others condemned them for the relatively high wages they earned. It was a reflection of class tensions raised by the restructured wartime economy and women's role in it. British authorities offered small ""separation allowances,"" subsidies to soldiers' families based on the loss of income, and in turn assumed the right to check up on soldiers' wives, to make sure they were not drinking or sleeping with other men. A woman who followed her own factory shift with dancing or a quick drink at the pub confronted public accusations of being a ""flaunting flapper"" or an ""amateur girl"" -- effectively a prostitute -- even as fellow male workers and soldiers on leave might proposition and harass her. Some women felt new ""freedom"" during the war; others saw changing ""moral standards"" as the result of women who had seen their men ""swallowed up in that ever-increasing wave of death ..."" In continental Europe, where the war was actually fought, conditions on the home front were even more challenging. Many women took on ""men's work"" to support the war effort and to ensure their families' survival but also found themselves subject to still more controlling government policies that came with ""total war."" Women living in captured territories suffered added misery, billeting and serving often abusive foreign soldiers. The 'bionic men' of World War I . In Italy, urban women were effectively drafted into agricultural labor. Women farmers were, however, little mollified by this motley work force intended to substitute for missing men and draught animals. In European cities, women often stood in line for hours for a chance to purchase spoiled potatoes; together with barefoot children, they tried to scavenge food and fuel from public parks, a practice that had become a full-time job in itself . In Germany, a 1916 policy reserved scarce food supplies only for women who worked in munitions factories, as officials announced that ""the entire remaining civilian population, including women, were to be militarized through this plan."" In the extraordinarily frigid winter of 1916-17, as schools shut down for lack of heat, the policy left few adults available to care for children. By the end of hostilities, the war had transformed women's lives. In many warring nations, acknowledging women's contributions became critical to warding off challenges to politicians' own power in the tumultuous postwar conditions, across Europe especially. Women won voting rights during hostilities or soon after in the United States, Canada and Great Britain; in the German Republic and the new Soviet republics; and in the new states of Austria, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Economic rights were a different matter. Demobilizing soldiers and groups claiming to represent them pressured officials and factory owners alike to ""make room"" in the workforce for returning men by laying off all women although women frequently remained the only potential earners in their households. This was one manifestation of powerful and contentious culture wars over the desirability and even possibility of returning to some halcyon past -- one that, like today, was in part imagined. Battles ensued across European and North American societies over how to otherwise recognize women's work during the war. Should newly impoverished women receive government assistance on the basis of their wartime contributions or only as dependents of wounded or fallen soldiers -- or perhaps not at all? In Britain, authorities shunned the arguments of women's groups and deferred rather to claims of the need to put men back in their ""proper"" role of economic power, by retaining the wartime notion of benefits deriving only through the husband. In Germany and Russia, conversely, women were now in principle to have equal status, though the practice did not always follow the principle. The divided attitudes about the value of female work that informed these debates lingers today. The flood of some 50,000,000 men back home at war's end in 1918 and 1919 also brought new tensions into family life. Returning soldiers imagined home as a refuge of normality after the nightmare of war. Yet men's physical and psychological injuries often precluded any return to their prewar existences, as did the social and economic upheaval of these years. What was ""normal"" had of course changed for the women left behind. With their new roles and autonomy, they were often blamed for this world turned upside down. Such gender conflicts lasted through the 20th century and beyond, like many other legacies of World War I.","Belinda Davis: World War I changed women across globe in ways that affect us today .

"Tunis, Tunisia (CNN) -- Thousands of people gathered on the main boulevard in Tunis on Saturday to commemorate the first anniversary of a demonstration that toppled the president and set in motion a string of revolts across the Arab world. What came to be known as the Arab Spring saw presidents removed from power in Libya, Egypt, and Yemen and sparked protests from Algeria to Iran and Iraq. Demonstrations continue in Bahrain, and anti-government protests in Syria have led to a brutal and ongoing government crackdown. Saturday's crowd on Habib Bourguiba Boulevard was similar to the demonstration there last January, challenging the Interior Ministry over high unemployment, alleged corruption, rising prices and limitations on rights. The crowd a year ago shouted ""Get out!"" to longtime President Zine Al Abidine Ben Ali, calling for his ouster. A day later, Ben Ali -- the authoritarian president who had ruled the north African country for 24 years -- fled with his family to Saudi Arabia. This year, the crowd represented all sorts of political groups from ultra-conservative Salafists to communists, as well as many Tunisians who were there last year. They expressed pride at the so-far smooth political transition but many held signs expressing their distress about the economy and the failure of the revolution to offer them jobs and a better life. Tunisia last month swore in a new president, Moncef Marzouki, a secularist known for his opposition to the old regime. Regional leaders including Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika; the head of Libya's National Transitional Council, Mustapha Abdeljalil; and the prince of Qatar, Hamed el Thani, attended an official celebration ceremony in downtown Tunis. Opposition movements have expressed their dissatisfaction at the way the celebrations were organized and the absence of high-profile representatives of the world's leading democracies. Groups held signs against Qatar, blamed for interfering in Tunisia's internal and foreign policies, and against the foreign ties of Tunisia's Ennahda ruling party.","Crowds gather on the main boulevard in Tunis .

"(CNN) -- Bewildered residents in rural Tennessee are grappling with fear and confusion as they try to understand why someone would send a bomb in the mail to their neighbor. Retired lawyer Jon Setzer, 74, died Monday after ""an unknown package exploded,"" the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said. His wife, 72-year-old Marion Setzer, was seriously injured and airlifted to Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Law enforcement sources say that a note was recovered from the bombing scene and was believed to have been attached to the bomb. Investigators on Wednesday were cataloging evidence of a blast that was powerful enough to extend through much of the house and destroy windows. A barrage of federal, state and local authorities descended on the neighborhood near Lebanon, Tennessee, about 30 miles east of Nashville. The FBI, U.S. postal inspectors, the Department of Homeland Security and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are also investigating. So far, they haven't publicly disclosed a motive. Those who knew the couple well are astonished. ""It doesn't make sense at all,"" family friend Ken Caldwell told CNN affiliate WTVF. ""When I've heard it said that it was targeted, I thought, well, they must have targeted the wrong person."" Michael Knight, spokesman for the ATF in Nashville, said investigators are looking at how the package was delivered and whether there were any threats to the family. They haven't identified suspects, he said. Investigators are testing items in the home, including labels and pieces of paper, to determine whether they were part of the package or perhaps previous deliveries. One bomb expert, Joseph Vince, a former ATF agent, said investigators will looking at whether revenge may be a motive. ""Clients that didn't like the way they were represented -- or they represented some other client -- now this is payback,"" said Vince, director of criminal justice programs at Mount St. Mary's University in Maryland. ""With a note in there, it very well may be some intentional revenge or something, that the attacker, the bomber, wanted to send them a message,"" Vince added. ""This is a very important piece of evidence, because now you may have handwriting."" The victims took the package from the mailbox about 200 yards away from the house, which is in a rural area, Knight said. The blast occurred near the front door of the house, though it's not clear whether just inside or right at the door. Authorities said they haven't seen any copy-cat incidents or secondary suspicious packages, which often happens in these cases. A dedicated servant . Before he retired, John Setzer worked on bankruptcy and other cases. His former law partner, George Cate Jr., said Setzer was a dedicated servant and a pastor at ""little country churches."" The two met while serving in the Army Reserve. Cate couldn't understand why anyone would want to target Setzer or his wife. ""I could hardly believe what I was being told because nothing had happened in my recent times to make me anticipate anything of this kind happening,"" Cate told CNN affiliate WZTV. ""John and Marion Setzer are a great couple, and they have dedicated themselves to taking care of other people."" He remembered when the couple's son John was killed by a dog at age 3. After that, whenever the Setzers saw a news report about a child's death, they ""would immediately go and visit with the parents of that child and share something of what they had gone through."" Cate and Setzer became partners at the law firm bearing their names between 1979 and 1991. Setzer worked on general civil cases and also specialized in living trusts, his former partner said. Cate said Setzer's love of law became hampered by his health problems, which made it difficult to respond to all his clients' needs. Setzer continued working from home after leaving the office, but eventually decided to quit practicing, Cate said. Terrified of the mailbox . On the Setzers' quiet rural street, neighbors were terrified about whether a bomb might arrive in their mailbox. Some told WZTV that officers went house to house Monday night to check mailboxes for devices. ""Of course it makes us a little anxious to go check our own mailbox when we see something like this happen, because normally boxes are delivered and mail is delivered, and you don't question it,"" neighbor Tony Dedman told the affiliate. Postal Inspectors have investigated an average of 16 mail bombs over the past few years, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service said. By contrast, the Postal Service has processed more than 170 billion pieces of mail each of the past few years. The agency said mail bombs often have similar characteristics, such as a fake or non-existent return address. They often have excessive postage attached to the package because the sender doesn't want to deal face to face with a window clerk. An $8,000 reward is available for information leading to the arrest and conviction of anyone responsible for the attack on the Setzers. Anyone with information can call 1-800-TBI-FIND. CNN's Evan Perez and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","NEW: Authorities recover a note from bombing scene, law enforcement sources tell CNN .

"(CNN) -- Ahmed Shafik was Hosni Mubarak's last prime minister. Now he hopes to become Egypt's first democratically elected president. He is running against Mohamed Morsi of the Freedom and Justice Party, the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood, in the presidential runoff election that begins Saturday. Like Mubarak, Shafik is a former air force officer with close ties to Egypt's powerful military, ""the quintessential candidate of the counter-revolution,"" in the words of Khaled Elgindy, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. Shafik, who briefly served as prime minister in the waning days of Mubarak's presidency, is one of two candidates to advance from the country's first round of presidential voting in May. The runoff election between Shafik and Morsi will decide who will become Egypt's first democratically elected president. On Thursday, Egypt's highest court ruled cleared the way for Shafik to participate in the runoff after invalidating a law that barred former members of Mubarak's regime from running in the election. The ruling came the same day the court dissolved parliament after declaring the constitutional articles that regulated parliamentary elections were invalid. Despite his ties to Mubarak's rule, Shafik, 72, is trying to portray himself as a man of the people. In the weeks leading up to the May election, his presidential campaign used all the tools of the Internet age to get his message out, with a website, a YouTube channel, a Facebook page and a Twitter feed. One of his many YouTube videos shows him dressed in a black T-shirt, meeting supporters and pinching the cheeks of a cute little boy. His campaign posters portray him in more professional attire, in a suit and tie, just a hint of an avuncular smile around his lips and the eyes behind his rimless glasses. And his Facebook page shows off a photo of him as a young man with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, who won a Nobel Peace Prize for making peace with Israel before he was assassinated for the historic outreach. In the decades of Mubarak rule that followed, Shafik rose through the ranks. As Egyptians rose up against Mubarak in January 2011, the man who had led the country so long that he was nicknamed ""Pharaoh"" shuffled his government ministers one last time, promoting Shafik from civil aviation minister to prime minister. Mubarak was toppled less than two weeks later, but Shafik remained in power for a few weeks longer, saying he and his government would report to the military council that took control of the country after Mubarak resigned. Shafik himself resigned on March 3, 2011, after a brief effort to keep Mubarak and his allies from being prosecuted after their ouster. As a result, Shafik is supported by many of those who lost out as a result of Mubarak's removal from power, said Omar Ashour, director of Middle East studies at the University of Exeter in England, who is currently in Cairo. His supporters include ""the powerful ones, a collection of businessmen and generals,"" said Ashour, a visiting scholar at the Brookings Institution in Doha, Qatar. Some members of the Supreme Council of Armed Forces may also back him ""because he might maintain the status quo,"" Ashour said, doubting that Shafik could win a popular vote. ""There's no way he would get in without (vote) rigging and, if that happened, I think there would be the possibility of another revolution,"" Ashour said. Ashour plays down the chance of that happening, however, saying it would be too dangerous for the Supreme Council of Armed Forces, given the current volatile situation in Egypt. Shafik has been the target of particular anger from the Muslim Brotherhood, the country's venerable Islamic opposition movement that won the largest share of the seats in parliamentary elections after the revolution. In April, the Brotherhood called for a mass protest in Cairo's Tahrir Square, the symbolic heart of the Egyptian revolution, against the presidential candidacies of Shafik and Omar Suleiman, Mubarak's longtime head of intelligence. Both were disqualified from running, but Shafik successfully appealed the ruling. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","Ahmed Shafik was Hosni Mubarak's last prime minister .

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States expressed concern Thursday about recent arrests in Zimbabwe of political and civil society activists and allegations by their lawyer that some of them were tortured. On February 19, former Movement for Democratic Change Member of Parliament Munyaradzi Gwisai and 45 other labor union and student activists ""who had gathered peacefully to discuss recent events in Egypt"" were arrested and charged with treason, State Department spokesman Philip J. Crowley said in a statement. Other political and civil society activists have also been arrested, he said. ""Gwisai's defense attorney has reported that several of the 46 people were tortured while in custody, and we understand that the magistrate has ordered physical examinations to substantiate those claims,"" he said. ""We call on the government to provide medical attention for those who need it and, if torture occurred, to take immediate action to hold the perpetrators accountable."" A ruling on the charges' merits is to be delivered March 7. Crowley called on the government of Zimbabwe to uphold rights spelled out under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and to ensure that those arrested are guaranteed due process. Zimbabwean authorities said the 46 people were arrested and charged with treason after they were caught watching footage of the protests that led to the ouster of Tunisian leader Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. ""On 16 February they held a meeting and the purpose of the meeting was to organize, strategize and implement the removal of a constitutional government of Zimbabwe by unconstitutional means, the Tunisian-Egyptian way,"" prosecutor Edmore Nyazamba said last week in court. At least 12 of the activists were beaten with broomsticks on their buttocks and the soles of their feet, defense attorney Alec Muchadehama told a packed courtroom on Thursday. All 46 defendants were charged with treason, a charge that carries a death sentence in Zimbabwe. ""If watching television footage of the uprisings was treason, most Zimbabweans would be guilty of it because we watch news daily,"" Muchadehama said. Robert Mugabe, 87, has ruled Zimbabwe since independence in 1980. Like Mubarak and Ben Ali, he has been accused of rigging elections and instituting repressive laws to tighten his grip on power. The arrests may be an indication that authorities are worried that the changes sweeping across north Africa may inspire Zimbabweans to rise up. The opposition Movement for Democratic Change, MDC, which is in a troubled unity government with Mugabe's ZANU-PF, has called the arrests ""an abuse of state machinery by ZANU-PF to suppress the people's views."" Mugabe's policies over the past decade have been blamed for plunging the once-prosperous country into economic crisis. Mugabe has called for an election this year, but his political rival and leader of the MDC, Morgan Tsvangirai, has threatened to boycott the poll if a referendum on a new constitution is not held.","Allegations that some activists beaten on their buttocks and soles of their feet .

"Cairo (CNN) -- A leather-faced Egyptian fruit seller said it best: ""The revolution was like a beautiful woman. She charmed us, and we fell in love with her and killed the tyrant to marry her, but she was just a trick -- another burden to add to our heavy load, and we are falling out of love."" Strolling through the streets of my native Cairo for the first time in four years, I can see the heartbreak on every face. From the lines at gas stations to the crowds at public metros, every Egyptian looks exhausted and disappointed. Tahrir Square, the epicenter of revolt last year, now looks miserable, too. The icon of defiance has been reduced to just a bare patch of dry sand with a few dilapidated tents. As one driver told me, ""If you want drugs, hashish or to hire a thug, go to Tahrir Square."" The legacy of the revolution now lives in the streets, where a lack of security means many women feel less safe and are less likely to leave their homes by themselves after dark. It lives in the abandoned tourist sites and four-star hotels, where managers with only 20% occupancy rates struggle to stay afloat amid numerous worker strikes and an uncertain economic climate. It lives in the cafes, where youngsters angrily dismiss our cameras, tired of the spotlight, irritated with the attention and seemingly embarrassed with the revolution that was once a point of pride. Cairo is both familiar and unrecognizable since my visit to the city in 2008 when my grandmother demanded I destroy a pamphlet on workers' rights out of fear the Egyptian authorities might harass me. This time, before I can even finish asking a question about elections, my family erupts into a furious debate, each member siding with a different candidate and attacking each other for supporting ""fellul"" -- or remnants of the old regime. No one, however, seems certain of their loyalties to any particular candidate, and even the weakest of arguments or the strangest of rumors can shift public opinion overnight. In a park in the posh neighborhood of Zamalek, activist Jawad Nabulsi asks a ticket seller, ""Who will you vote for?"" The middle-aged man replies, ""Shafik,"" a presidential candidate and former prime minister in the dying days of Hosni Mubarak's regime. Unhappy with the answer, Nabulsi tells him to vote for moderate Islamist candidate Abdelmonen Abol Fotoh. ""If you really thinks he is better, then I will vote for him,"" the ticket seller responds. Egypt's fickle voters repeat the scenario every day in buses and offices. So each morning, it seems residents have chosen a different president -- only to abandon him the next day. This has left analysts and citizens alike without any clear expectation of who will win Egypt's first-ever free elections. Read more about Egypt's historic presidential elections . Egypt's indecision lies in its limited range of candidates, essentially leaving constituents with frontrunners who are either former members of Mubarak's regime or Islamists. ""It's like all these years we have had these soccer players sitting on the sidelines, and now that we see them in the field playing we can see all their weaknesses and failures,"" one student at a downtown cafe said. The country of 81 million seems so distracted with who has the soccer ball, many seem completely unaware of what or where the ultimate goal for Egypt's future stands. The day Mubarak stepped down in February 2011, I cried in the CNN newsroom, feeling for the first time ever that my people -- crippled by 30 years of dictatorship -- could not just walk but actually run towards freedom. But some Egyptians have lowered their expectations, moving from the revolutionary chant of ""bread, freedom and social justice"" to the murmured remark, ""just let us live."" The revolutionary movement -- splintered and fragmented under the pressure of rebuilding the country -- failed to create a unified coalition or a clear post-revolution strategy. ""I know the revolutionaries are hated right now. The country is blaming us for everything, and at the same time we have seen so much blood we feel conflicted about calling upon people to demonstrate,"" protester and blogger Sara Abdelrahman said. Some Egyptians say the situation has deteriorated. ""Everything is worse! The price of everything has increased. People can't make a living. We can't eat. The situation is awful, and the hardships are greater,"" one woman said at a Cairo metro. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, the target of many demonstrators' rage, has pledged to hand over executive power to a civilian president by the end of June, completing the transition to a freely elected government almost 16 months after the revolution started. Far from the headscarves and Muslim beards dominating Cairo's streets, female protesters in jeans and free-flowing hair said the revolution is ongoing, but admitted the downfall of Mubarak's regime had yet to accomplish much for Egypt. ""Nothing changes overnight. The military stole the revolution, and we are struggling to win it back,"" said Amal Bakry, a member of the group No Military Trials for Civilians. ""But we will continue fighting and continue to struggle against the regime until every last corner of the country is liberated.""","A year after Egypt's revolt, many are disappointed with the situation in the country .

"Yosemite National Park, California (CNN) -- The numbers are staggering and the prospects are scary as a still-growing California wildfire menaces Yosemite National Park and San Francisco's water supply. The tourist hotspot Yosemite Valley and its iconic attractions, including the El Capitan rock formation, currently are safe, miles from the Rim Fire's reach. However, the blaze was on the edge of the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, which serves 2.6 million customers in the Bay Area. Water quality remains unchanged, despite ash that has fallen on the 459-square-mile reservoir, because the water is drawn from a depth of 260 feet, according to the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. The city was already transferring 275 million gallons of water daily from Hetch Hetchy to other reservoirs because Hetch Hetchy is full, but as a precautionary measure, the city increased that amount by 27 million gallons, a Tuesday statement said. The commission said it was confident the Rim Fire would not affect the reservoir: ""Due to the rocky, granite terrain and limited brush along the perimeter of the reservoir, there is little risk for direct water quality impacts."" The fire could threaten the area's hydroelectric generators, which provide much of San Francisco's electricity. Because of the approaching flames, officials shut down the generators, and the city -- more than 120 miles to the west -- temporarily is getting power from elsewhere. ""All of San Francisco's municipal electric customers continue to be fully supplied; there will be no interruption in electric service,"" the commission said. The Rim Fire, which has devoured about 184,000 acres, was still only 20% contained as of Tuesday evening. It is the seventh largest blaze in California's recorded history. ""There's a lot of concern, and there's a lot of work to be done,"" U.S. Forest Service spokesman Lee Bentley said. Firefighters on Tuesday were able to build fire lines in several locations. Evacuations were ordered south of Highway 120, north of Old Yosemite Road and along the Highway 108 corridor between Tuolumne City and Pinecrest. ""Access and difficult terrain remain concerns for crews and equipment,"" said an incident report. ""Rapid fire growth and extreme fire behavior are hampering suppression efforts."" As many as 20 helicopters and DC-10 and C-130 air tankers were aiding the efforts of 3,800 firefighting personnel. A top priority is stopping the fire from spreading farther in Yosemite National Park. A portion of Tioga Road in the park will be closed for several days beginning Wednesday so that firefighters can perform fire suppression. ""The work that will be performed over the next few days is instrumental in suppressing the Rim Fire within Yosemite. The safety of the firefighters working along the road is our paramount concern,"" park Superintendent Don Neubacher said in a statement. Tamarack Flat and Yosemite Creek campgrounds, both located along Tioga Road, will remain closed. Yosemite fire: Blaze spreads to national park . Yosemite, with hundreds of campground sites and lodging units, had nearly 4 million visitors last year, the National Park Service said. The park typically has 15,000 visitors on a busy summer weekend. While the Rim Fire has consumed at least 12,000 acres in the northwest section of the park, it has had little or no direct impact on Yosemite Valley, a popular spot for tourists and home to many of the famous cliffs and waterfalls in the park. The park has closed a few roads, campgrounds and wildlife trails while restricting smoking and building camping or cooking fires in wilderness areas. About 5,500 structures, many of them vacation homes, were under threat, according to InciWeb, a federal website that collects information from agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management. The fire has cost more than $20 million, Bentley said. Thirty-one residences and 80 outbuildings have been destroyed. Wildfire threatens 90-year-old cabin . The inferno threatened the Yosemite gateway communities of Groveland and Pine Mountain Lake just outside the Stanislaus National Forest. ""Business is slow, very slow,"" said Corinna Loh, owner of the Iron Door Saloon in Groveland. Her normal season is Memorial Day to Labor Day. ""This is time we manage to save up money to make it through the winter, so it's really scary for all of us,"" she said, sitting among empty tables. The Tuolumne County Sheriff's Office, meanwhile, issued evacuation advisories for the town of Tuolumne and nearby Ponderosa Hill, InciWeb said. It was not clear how many residents were covered by the evacuation advisory. Authorities say the Rim Fire started on August 17. The cause is under investigation.

"(CNN) -- What is it about Americans and guns? How much time do you have? ""I can tell you that I don't think there's any other developed country in the world that has remotely the problem we have,"" New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said after the shooting rampage in Colorado. There are an estimated 270 million guns in the hands of civilians in the United States, making Americans the most heavily armed people in the world per capita. Yemen, a tribal nation with no history of strong central government or the rule of law, comes in a distant second. From Washington to the well-stocked shelves of Walmart stores nationwide, guns are regarded in the United States as a commonplace if controversial consumer item for millions of law-abiding hunters, collectors and citizens concerned about their safety. They are also in the hands of thousands of killers too; a Washington-based anti-gun lobby says those guns shoot more than 100,000 people a year. In 2010, there were more than 30,000 deaths caused by firearms when the number of homicides, suicides and accidental deaths are tallied. America's collective memory -- of the Wild West in the 1800s, the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King half a century ago and the front-page news from last week -- is marked time and time again by guns. ""It's undeniable,"" writes Clayton Cramer, author of ""Armed America: the Remarkable Story of How and Why Guns Became as American as Apple Pie."" ""Guns are at the center of much of America's history, its legends, and its horrors."" There were guns in America long before the America we know today was even born. Early settlers in several states were required by law to own and maintain weapons as a matter of collective defense. By the time the United States was established, its citizens had taken up arms not only against their Native American neighbors but the army of their own king. Their new constitution reflected that in its Bill of Rights, declaring that ""A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."" For more than two centuries, that remained an important but largely overlooked guarantee, subjected to a modest series of controls. But in 2008 and 2010, landmark Supreme Court rulings gave that constitutional right sweeping new power, dramatically diminishing the authority of state and local governments to limit gun ownership. Gun-friendly lawmakers have been active, too. Roughly half of the 50 U.S. states have adopted laws allowing gun owners to carry their guns openly in most public places. About as many states have ""stand your ground"" laws that allow people to kill if they come under threat, even, in some cases, if they can escape the threat without violence. The laws are being driven by politics, and the politics are being driven by groups such as the National Rifle Association. Once a relatively modest organization of gun enthusiasts and hunters, it has become one of the most powerful political groups in the country. The Washington Post estimates that the NRA succeeded in helping elect four out of every five candidates it endorsed in the most recent congressional election. In addition to that extraordinary impact in Congress, it has been working to overturn gun-control laws in the courts. The NRA and other gun-rights groups have allied themselves with the Republican Party and, especially, a sector of the American public suspicious of government intrusions into private life and often flatly hostile to Washington. Read Dana Bash: For Democrats, gun politics are bad politics . ""When they tell you that a government ban on certain firearms will somehow make you safer, don't you believe it, not for a second, because it's a lie just like the lies they've told you before,"" NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre told a recent gathering of his members. ""Their laws don't work."" Poll results suggest most Americans wouldn't agree. CNN and Gallup surveys going back years suggest that Americans are split between those who approve of current gun-control laws and respondents who would like to see them made more restrictive. Americans who'd like no controls at all are a small minority. But even after the rampage in Colorado, American attitudes and laws aren't likely to change much. Last year's nearly fatal shooting of congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords didn't move her state or federal colleagues to adopt any new gun control measures. Both President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney issued statements in the hours after the Colorado shootings, and Sunday, Obama flew to the state to visit with shooting victims and their families. But neither proposed any changes to American attitudes toward guns. ""You know, soothing words are nice, but maybe it's time that the two people who want to be president of the United States stand up and tell us what they are going to do about it, because this is obviously a problem across the country,"" said New York's Bloomberg, who is both a declared ""independent"" politically and a vocal proponent of gun control. America is not unique. Norwegians are marking the first anniversary of a shooting massacre that took the lives of 69 people at a summer camp outside of Oslo. Eight more people were that day killed by a bomb in the Norwegian capital itself. The confessed killer is awaiting the verdict of his trial. But America seems to be the place the whole world thinks of when apparently ordinary people use guns for grotesque acts of violence. America stands alone in its historic and cultural attachment to guns. America stands armed. Do you own a gun? Tell us why. Opinion: Mass murder and powerful firearms .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered a ""good cop-bad cop"" approach to Iran's nuclear ambitions on Wednesday, with Obama calling for more diplomacy while endorsing Israel's right to defend itself as it sees fit. The two leaders met for more than two hours on Obama's first visit to Israel as president, part of a Middle East swing that he said was intended to assess the seemingly intractable impasse between the Israelis and Palestinians over how to live next to each other. Other issues discussed on Obama's first foreign trip of his second term included the civil war in neighboring Syria. There have been unconfirmed reports of chemical weapons being used in the conflict, which Obama labeled a ""game-changer,"" if true, regarding limited U.S. involvement so far. With the visit, Obama sought to assure Netanyahu and Israelis of his commitment to their security and strengthen what has been a strained personal and working relationship with the prime minister. The two are each beginning new terms in power. 5 things to know about Obama's first presidential visit to Israel . In what Netanyahu called a key development, the leaders announced new talks on extending U.S. military assistance to Israel for another 10 years past the current agreement that expires in 2017. They also sounded united on other major issues. Both countries have accused Iran of secretly working toward building a nuclear weapon, and Netanyahu made clear Wednesday after his talks with Obama that he believes the president is equally committed to preventing a nuclear-armed Iran. Obama pushed at a joint news conference for continued diplomatic efforts, including negotiations and sanctions, intended to get Iran to comply with international safeguards against nuclear arms. ""The question is whether the Iranian leadership will seize that opportunity,"" Obama said before playing off a memorable Cold War line by Ronald Reagan about the Soviet Union: ""We can't even trust yet, much less verify."" At the same time, he insisted that ""all options"" remain open -- code for a military strike to disable the Iranian program. Obama also made clear that Israel has the right to defend itself as it sees fit, which amounted to a diplomatic signal that Washington would not stop a unilateral Israeli strike at some future point if no progress occurred. Opinion: Obama's Israel trip is about legacy . Netanyahu responded with thanks, saying Obama spoke of ""the great transformation that has occurred in the life of the Jewish people with a rebirth of the Jewish state"" that has grown from a once powerless population into a nation that has ""both the right and the capability"" to defend itself. ""I know that you appreciate that Israel can never cede the right to defend ourselves to others, even to the greatest of our friends, and Israel has no better friend than the United States of America,"" Netanyahu added. Both leaders also said they had a ""common assessment"" on how much time remained before Iran could build a nuclear weapon. Though Netanyahu indicated his ""red line"" for action might be sooner, referring to what he called a ""point of immunity"" when Tehran completed enriching enough uranium for a weapon. Iran has rebuffed calls to halt its production of enriched uranium, saying it has a right to produce peaceful nuclear energy. But the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, has said it can no longer verify any peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program. Poll: Most Americans say Israel is a friend . Most Americans consider Israel an ally or at least friendly to the United States, according to a new CNN/ORC International poll released Tuesday. However, respondents split -- 49%-49% -- on whether the United States should support Israel if it unilaterally attacks Iranian nuclear facilities to prevent Tehran from developing nuclear weapons, the survey showed. On Obama's first day in Israel, Palestinian activists erected a tent city outside Jerusalem in the West Bank to protest his visit and continued Israeli construction of settlements in what they consider an occupied territory. Meanwhile, demonstrators in Gaza protesting Israeli and U.S. policies toward Palestinians burned flags of both nations as well as a picture of Obama. Israeli president: No doubt Obama has Israel's back . The topic of settlements, a sticking point in the stalled Middle East peace process, never came up at the news conference by the leaders, showing the sensitivity of the issue. ""I purposely did not want to come here with some big announcement"" that might not match up with reality on the ground, Obama told reporters. The Israeli-Palestinian dispute . Both leaders said they discussed the Israel-Palestinian stalemate and Syria, further complicated by accusations that chemical weapons were used this week. Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni told CNN on Wednesday that ""it is clear for us here in Israel"" that chemical weapons have been used in Syria. When pressed during an interview, Livni wouldn't say whether there was evidence that the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad directed their use. She said the development poses a direct threat to Israel because ""the appearance is that it's not going to be only in Syria, but that Hezbollah can reach all these chemical weapons and use them against Israel in the future."" Israelis have long been concerned that Hezbollah, Israel's foe in neighboring Lebanon, could gain possession of Syrian chemical weapons if the al-Assad regime is further destabilized. Obama repeated U.S. warnings to the Syrian government to keep chemical weapons off the battlefield or out of the hands of groups such as Hezbollah. He said he has ordered an investigation into whether the Syrian government used chemical weapons against its own people, adding he was ""deeply skeptical"" of any claim the opposition had done it. ""Once we have established the facts, I have made clear that the use of chemical weapons is a game-changer,"" Obama declared, stopping short of saying what he would do if Syria had crossed his ""red line"" for stronger action. CNN Poll: Most say Israel a friend . Critics, including Republican opponents, say Obama has failed to show necessary global leadership by providing military aid to the Syrian opposition or offering help like establishing a ""no-fly"" zone over Syria similar to NATO steps taken in Libya during the Arab Spring uprising. Earlier, Netanyahu and Israeli President Shimon Peres greeted Obama at an arrival ceremony in Tel Aviv, where Obama said his visit was "" an opportunity to reaffirm the unbreakable bond between our nations, to restate America's unwavering commitment to Israel's security, and to speak directly to Israel and to your neighbors."" In a quip to Netanyahu, Obama said, ""It is nice to get away from Congress,"" reflecting the chronic political infighting in Washington. Obama's first stop Wednesday was at an Iron Dome missile defense launcher in Tel Aviv. Designed by Israel and funded by the United States, the battery was deployed at the height of November's fighting between Israel and Hamas. It intercepted a rocket headed for Tel Aviv, Israeli ambassador to the United States Michael Oren said. Afterward, the president went to Jerusalem to meet separately with Peres and Netanyahu. A shaky relationship . Obama's relationship with Netanyahu has never been warm, and the Israeli prime minister supported Republican challenger Mitt Romney -- a former business colleague -- in last year's presidential election. In his first term, Obama got off to a rocky start with Netanyahu by pushing for a freeze on Israeli settlements, but his vocal support for the Israeli prime minister through the November crisis with Hamas and U.S. financial support for the Iron Dome anti-missile program could pave the road for greater trust in the relationship. White House officials said Obama was not bringing a new peace initiative and lacked optimism that enough solid ground existed to try to revive direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians over the declared goal of both sides for separate, neighboring states. Israeli minister says she hopes U.S. helps restart peace talks . Most of all, the president's aides said, Obama wanted to assess how prepared -- if at all -- Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas were to return to negotiations. Palestinians want Obama to prove there were consequences for Israel's continued construction of new settlements in what they consider to be disputed areas. Their grievances are evident in more personal ways: Posters on Ramallah streets sarcastically advise Obama not to bring his smartphone because Israel does not allow 3G or better service in the Palestinian territories. Before meeting Peres on Wednesday, Obama and the Israeli president planted a magnolia tree descended from those at the White House to symbolize the deep roots of the relationship between their nations, the White House said. The two leaders also were serenaded with the song ""Tomorrow"" by three young Israelis who dedicated it ""from all the children who dream of peace."" The U.S. and Israel and the art of relationship maintenance . CNN's John King and Jessica Yellin reported from Israel, and CNN's Paul Steinhauser and Ashley Killough also contributed to this report. It was written by Tom Cohen in Washington.","NEW: President Obama, Israel's prime minister have a ""common assessment"" on Iran .

"(CNN) -- As millions of students across the world go back to school this month, 178 students from 49 countries will turn on their computers and step onto the virtual campus of the world's first global, tuition-free online university. Lessons in learning: University of the People is hoping to use the power of social networks to expand education. Called University of the People, the non-profit, California-based endeavor comes from Israeli entrepreneur Shai Reshef who says he founded the school to provide higher education to those who might otherwise never have access to it. ""Our mission is to change people's lives,"" said Reshef, who also is the chairman of Cramster.com, an online study community for college students. Starting in 1989, Reshef served as the head of Kidum Group, an educational services company based in Israel, which he sold to Kaplan, one of the world's largest test preparation companies, in 2005. He also chaired an online university affiliated with the University of Liverpool. ""We want to be an option for people who don't have any other option,"" he said. There has been no shortage of interest. Since the school started enrolling students in April, nearly 2,000 people from 142 countries have applied. Reshef says the online institution will need 15,000 students over the next four years in order to be sustainable and will need $6 million to fund the venture, of which $1 million he will provide. To attend, students must have a high school diploma, speak English and pay admission fees ranging from $15 to $50, with those from poorer countries paying less and those from richer countries paying more. Students will also have to pay to take exams. In all, it will cost around $4,000 for students to complete their studies and gain a qualification. The school initially will offer bachelor's degrees in business administration and computer science. Curriculum consists of around 40 courses, which will take between four and six years to complete. This year's freshman class includes pupils ages 16 to 61. Indonesia has the highest number of students enrolled, followed by the United States, Brazil and Nigeria. Now that University of the People has proven it can recruit students, the next challenge it faces is whether it can keep them enrolled. ""That is a concern,"" said Reshef. ""One of the main issues with online universities is retention."" While e-learning has been booming in recent years -- in 2007, nearly 4 million students in the U.S. took at least one course online, according to the Sloan Consortium, a nonprofit dedicated to integrating online learning into higher education -- a challenge educators often face is how to keep students engaged in virtual classrooms. Make it social . To try to solve this problem, the University of the People is turning to an activity that already keeps millions of people occupied on the Internet everyday: social networking. The University of the People's staff of volunteer and retired professors will post readings and lectures in an online repository for students to retrieve and study. Materials come for free from other universities via platforms such as the Open Courseware Consortium, which provides open access to the syllabi, lecture notes, exams and reading lists from 1,800 classes offered at MIT. The university will also use course material from Yale University, said Reshef. ""Basically what we do is we take everything that is out there and bring it together,"" he said. After the students complete their homework, it is mandatory for them to link up with classmates online to discuss the week's curriculum. Unless a student needs special help, teachers will supervise discussions rather than lead them, said Reshef. ""We believe the social networking we build around our programs will serve as a cement to keep students with each other and stay in our program,"" said Reshef. ""We are fitting the current culture into the academic culture."" However, online education experts are raising questions, particularly surrounding whether University of the People can become accredited. To achieve accreditation, a college must prove it can meet a number of quality assurances set forth by an accrediting body, including breadth and depth of coursework and student test results. Reshef said the university would apply for accreditation with an agency in the U.S. but declined to disclose further plans. ""We are not making any promises,"" he told CNN. John Bourne, executive director of the Sloan Consortium, believes the University of the People may face problems. ""Can you accredit something where students are learning themselves from materials? Maybe,"" he told CNN. ""Testing outcomes capability -- what students can do or how well students test -- may be a way the University of the People can succeed in its model. ""If that works, then that would be evidence accreditation might be warranted. I still think it will be hard."" New ways to learn . However, there is evidence that could work in favor of the University of the People's cause. A recent study conducted by the U.S. Department of Education found that ""on average, students in online learning conditions performed better than those receiving face-to-face instruction."" ""The current methodology is based on the lecture, and that is a thousand-year-old model that is completely inappropriate with the new generation,"" Don Tapscott, author of ""Grown Up Digital: How the Net Generation is Changing Your World"", told CNN. ""If it is shown that there are better models of learning than the current model, then the credentialing function of the old model will be weakened,"" said Tapscott. ""The Internet is a new mode of production. It was inevitable that peers would come together and create an online university."" Other organizations are also experimenting with Web 2.0 platforms, like social networking sites and blogs, to tap into the ways in which younger generations are wired to the web. In January, Nature Education, launched Scitable, a social network platform around an online encyclopedia of freely-published scientific articles. Like Facebook, Scitable users create personal profiles. Unlike Facebook, members share information about genetic research instead of exchanging vacation pictures. Nature Education started the venture in an attempt to reignite student interest in science, said Vikram Savkar, publishing director of Nature Education, who noted that 40 percent of students in the U.S. who start college studying science end up switching majors by the time they graduate. ""One of the things we recognized is the materials being provided are not adequate for younger generations who are growing up in a world where information is dynamic, shareable and bite-sized,"" said Savkar. ""We are creating a global classroom for science and allowing people to freely collaborate. We want to put high quality teaching and learning materials into the hands of anybody and everybody who wants to become a scientist,"" he added. ""Sharing data and sharing ideas and coming up with joint conclusions is at the heart of how science works. It is about leveraging each other's knowledge and abilities.""","University of the People launches to provide tuition-free online degrees .

"(CNN) -- One stands as tall as a red British phone booth. The other is the height of six stacked cans of baked beans. On Thursday, for the first time, the man with the tallest recorded height in the world and the shortest man in the world met at an event in London, where they posed for photos and stretched for an awkward handshake. The occasion was the 10th annual Guinness World Records Day, which celebrates record-setting achievements around the globe. The Guinness folks flew the two men, Sultan Kosen of Turkey and Chandra Bahadur Dangi of Nepal, to London for the unique photo op. Kosen, 31, is a part-time farmer who measures 8 feet, 3 inches tall and can reach a basketball hoop without jumping. He became the world's tallest living man in 2009, overtaking China's Xi Shun, who stood a mere 7 feet 9 inches. Dangi, 74, is just 21½ inches tall and is the shortest adult human ever verified by Guinness World Records. A weaver who also helps look after buffaloes and cows in his remote mountain village of Reemkholi, he weighs just 32 pounds. ""To be able to finally meet Chandra after all this time is amazing,"" Kosen said at the event. ""Even though he is short and I am tall, we have had similar struggles throughout our lives, and when I look into Chandra's eyes, I can see he's a good man."" Kosen also holds the record for largest hands on a living person. His measure 11.2 inches from the wrist to the tip of his middle finger. Thousands of people took part in Guinness World Records events around the world Thursday, with records tumbling in Australia, France, Dubai, China, Germany, Japan, the UK and the United States. In Shanghai, 388 people went for a record for the largest communal breakfast in bed.","For the first time, the tallest recorded man in the world met the shortest man .

"Houston, Texas (CNN) -- A U.S. district court judge denied bail Friday for a man charged with a federal hate crime in connection with a ""knockout"" assault against an elderly black man that authorities say was racially motivated. Conrad Alvin Barrett, 27, of Katy, Texas, has been charged with one count of violating the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act. Barrett, who arrived in federal court in Houston wearing an orange jail jumpsuit and leg shackles, faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, if convicted. Federal prosecutors contend Barrett attacked the 79-year-old man because of the color of his skin. ""I do not believe there are any conditions that will guarantee the safety of the community,"" Judge Frances H. Stacy said in her ruling. The judge said there was sufficient evidence to show Barrett committed the assault, which she described as a hate crime. ""The crime was vicious. The victim lost three teeth. He was an old man. He was singled out because of his race,"" Stacy said. A federal prosecutor told the court that Barrett made a video of the November 24 attack. In the video, according to a federal affidavit filed in the case, Barrett allegedly said: ""The plan is to see if I were to hit a black person, would this be nationally televised?"" He then allegedly ""hit the man with such force that the man immediately fell to the ground. Barrett then laughed and said 'knockout,' as he ran to his vehicle and fled."" The victim suffered two jaw fractures and was hospitalized for several days, the complaint said. Barrett's attorney, George Parnham, raised the issue of his client's mental health in court, saying his client has been diagnosed as bipolar and was not on his medication at the time of the attack. Parnham told CNN earlier that he could not say whether his client carried out the attack, but, ""mental health issues definitely played a part in anything that occurred."" Barrett ""is very sorry for this person,"" Parnham said, adding that he and his client haven't had much opportunity to discuss the facts of the case. 'Knockout game' a national problem . The ""knockout game"" is an assault in which an assailant aims to knock out an unsuspecting victim with one punch. According to the Justice Department complaint, there have been ""knockout game"" incidents, some of which have been called other names, as long ago as 1992. New York police previously charged suspect Marajh Amrit with a hate crime in the alleged attack of a white Jewish man as part of a ""knockout"" game. Similar cases have been reported recently in several states, including Illinois, Missouri and Washington. ""Hate crimes tear at the fabric of entire communities,"" U.S. Acting Assistant Attorney General Jocelyn Samuels said Thursday in a Justice Department statement announcing the charge against Barrett. ""As always, the Civil Rights Division will work with our federal and state law enforcement partners to ensure that hate crimes are identified and prosecuted, and that justice is done."" Barrett, who is white, allegedly recorded himself on his cell phone attacking the man and showed the video to others, the department said. ""The complaint alleges Barrett made several videos, one in which he identifies himself and another in which he makes a racial slur. In addition, Barrett had allegedly been working up the 'courage' to play the 'knockout game' for approximately a week."" The victim's face was swollen on one side, and he has had to use a straw to drink, a nephew, Joseph Lewis, told CNN affiliate KTRK-TV in Houston. In a letter to the court, the victim -- who has not been identified -- asked the judge not to release Barrett. ""Judge, I am the man who was attacked by Conrad Barrett. I hope he will not be released because I am afraid he will hurt me if he is released,"" said the letter, which was read in court by a federal prosecutor. ""Since the attack, I've had to live with my children and have people take care of me. If you set him free, I'll worry that he can attack me again at any time. Please do not release him and give me my freedom."" FBI Agent Alfred Tribble testified during the hearing that the video shows Barrett approaching the victim and asking ""How's it going?""

"(CNN) -- Former Italian motorcycle racer Doriano Romboni has been killed in an accident at an event marking the memory of late MotoGP rider Marco Simoncelli. Romboni, 44, was struck by another motorcycle during a training session for the second annual ""Sic Supermoto Day"" at Italy's Latina circuit, 70 kilometers south east of the capital Rome. Following the incident, Romboni was airlifted to hospital but died shortly after arrival, Italian News Agency ANSA reported. The fatal accident has echoes of the way his compatriot Simoncelli died. The 24-year-old was killed following a collision with American rider Colin Edwards and Italy's Valentino Rossi during the Malaysian Grand Prix in October 2011. Romboni was a six-time winner in 125cc and 250cc races and competed in the 500cc class (the forerunner to MotoGP) from 1996-1998 with his best finish coming at the 1997 Dutch TT at Assen where he finished third for the Aprilia team.","Former Italian 500cc racer dies following accident at Marco Simoncelli tribute event .

"(CNN) -- After nearly 10 years of expertly skewering American pop culture and the television wasteland, E!'s clip show ""The Soup"" is raising the stakes on its own program and will broadcast live for the first time to mark the series' 500th episode. The show will air live on both coasts on August 21 at 10 p.m. At a recent taping for the 499th episode, host Joel McHale and executive producer K.P. Anderson spoke with reporters about the milestone and what Anderson called the ""high-wire effect"" of the live show. ""I have full-on dyslexia,"" McHale said. ""So that'll be great. I think it really brings a sense of danger."" The 500th show will be a ""Soup"" fans recognize, rather than a retrospective. ""I think live is pretty much the trick,"" Anderson said. ""We'll have a couple of little surprises along the way with our special guests, but I think we as a show do better when the material is fresh and we have new jokes."" As of the interview, the special guests -- a different set for each coast -- include B.J. Novak, Adam Carolla and perhaps Lady Gaga. (She was still pending.) McHale said he prefers a good mix. ""It's like getting a Blizzard at Dairy Queen,"" he quipped. As for dream guests in the future, he named Paul McCartney, Beyonce and Jay Z, Justin Bieber because ""apparently he has a fan base,"" David Byrne from Talking Heads and Prince. ""I would love for Prince (to come on),"" McHale said. ""Prince, open invitation."" And why not? McHale said most guests enjoy their experience. ""Without exception,"" he said, ""every single reality star I have ever met has said, 'Please put me on your show' or 'Thank you for having me on your show and may I come back on?' No one has gone, 'How dare you?' "" Still, the host admitted he never thought ""The Soup"" would last. ""We have a 50-year plan,"" he joked. ""This is phase one. It's complete. Phase two is the next 10 years."" But seriously, ""I never thought it would go this long. No one ever thought that. ""There was always the sense, especially in the first couple of years, that no one was watching, kind of like public access. And that sense that people still aren't watching has never left."" ""The TV landscape has changed over the time that we've been doing (the show),"" Anderson said. ""We''ve talked about how we're going to change things because 'Pawn Stars' became more popular than the scream-at-each-other-and-puke-in-the-foyer-shows"" that were the show's bread and butter early on. ""The success (of 'The Soup') is we take all of the mayhem that exists out there and bring it under one roof. But what that is changes all the time."" Currently the show's staff is obsessed with ""Whodunnit?"" the goofy murder mystery show on ABC. ""The clips aren't necessarily the most provocative, but the show has been driving the staff out of its mind all summer. There are zero stakes. There's no tension,"" he said. ""And we love it."" Though it's hard to remember most of the clips the show has churned through over the 500 episodes, some, like Whitney Houston on ""Being Bobby Brown"" and Tila Tequila on ""Shot at Love,"" naturally stand out. But it's ""Spaghetti Cat"" that McHale calls ""the greatest moment we ever had."" When McHale is not taping ""The Soup,"" he's busy filming movies and starring on NBC's ""Community."" The show's fifth season features the return of ""Community"" creator Dan Harmon, and while McHale modestly underplayed his role in getting Harmon back, it has been said he was instrumental. ""(Harmon) created the show and the show is in his voice, so to have it back in his voice I think was important,"" McHale told CNN. ""I was thrilled that he wanted to come back and that Sony was willing to have him back, so I've never been creatively happier.""","""The Soup"" marks its 500th episode milestone .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel says all 27 activists from two aid ships stopped on their way to Gaza have been deported or are awaiting flights out, but flotilla organizers say most refuse to sign papers required to expel them. Israeli sailors boarded the Gaza-bound vessels Friday as they neared the Palestinian territory, which has been under an Israeli blockade since 2007. The Irish-registered Saoirse and the Canadian Tahrir were taken to the Israeli port of Ashdod after refusing to heed calls to turn back, the Israeli military said. Organizers of the flotilla said six people, including the captains of both vessels and two journalists, had been released by Sunday evening. The remainder refused to sign waivers allowing their deportation, the Irish group said in a statement on its website. ""They are refusing to sign not because they are legally challenging deportation or are demanding to see a judge, but rather because the waiver says that they came to Israel voluntarily and that they entered the country illegally,"" the group said. Of course this is a lie and they won't agree to it."" The group criticized what it called a ""violent and dangerous"" seizure of the vessel. Fintan Lane, its coordinator, said the Israelis pointed guns at the passengers and turned high-pressure hoses on the Irish and Canadian boats, blasting out windows and causing a collision that left the Saoirse badly damaged. ""The method used in the takeover was dangerous to human life,"" organizers quoted Lane as reporting. ""The Israeli forces initially wanted to leave the boats at sea, but the abductees demanded that they not be left to float at sea, for they would have been lost and possibly sunk."" The Israel Defense Forces said its sailors ""took every precaution necessary to ensure the safety of the activists on board the vessels as well as themselves."" An Israeli foreign ministry spokesman said one Canadian aboard the flotilla complained of rough treatment by the Israeli military, but no details were provided. Activists criticized the Israeli action as ""illegal"" and vowed that activists ""will keep coming, wave after wave"" to try to deliver aid to Palestinians in Gaza. According to the activist organizers, this mission was the eleventh attempt to run Israel's blockade of Gaza by sea. Five missions arrived safely in Gaza between August and December 2008, with the rest intercepted by Israel. The activists said the boats were carrying medical supplies and letters of support for people in Gaza. Asked by the Israeli navy for their destination, Canadian activist Ehab Lotayef replied, ""The conscience of humanity,"" the activists said in a statement. When sailors repeated the question, asking for their final destination, Lotayef said, ""The betterment of mankind."" Passengers on the boats were from Canada, Ireland, the United States, Australia, and the Palestinian territories, the activists say. The flotillas have sparked international controversy. In 2010, an Israeli raid on one flotilla ship, the Mavi Marmara, resulted in nine Turkish activists being killed, a development that led to the deterioration of relations between Israel and Turkey, once close allies. Israel was roundly criticized by many over the deaths. A U.N. report criticized Israel for its use of excessive force in the incident but described the blockade -- which activists call illegal -- as a ""legitimate security measure."" Israel says it is concerned about the smuggling of arms to Gaza militants intent on attacking the Jewish state. Gaza is controlled by the anti-Israel Hamas militant group, regarded as a terrorist group by the United States and Israel. But activists say Israeli embargoes of goods into Gaza from land and sea are collective punishment of civilians in what is a tiny and densely populated strip of land along the Mediterranean coast. Israel has said any organization or state that wants to give humanitarian aid to Gaza can do so in coordination with Israeli authorities via existing land crossings into the Palestinian territory. CNN's Paul Colsey, Kareem Khadder and Nicky Robertson contributed to this report.","NEW: Activists refuse to sign deportation papers, organizers say .

"(CNN) -- As long as there are postmen, life will have zest. So said philosopher William James, though younger generations may question the need for snail mail at all. But Louis Schlamowitz, for one, is grateful to postmen, who over the years have dropped thousands of envelopes into the mailbox of his cramped apartment in the Canarsie neighborhood of Brooklyn, where he has spent all his life. In that box came words and photographs from the famous -- and sometimes the infamous. Now, in his closet, he has three jackets hanging, lonely among the 60 photo albums stacked up from the floor and on the shelf. ""South America"" contains Manuel Noriega. Fidel Castro. ""U.S. presidents"" includes John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, Barack Obama and Harry Truman, who started Schlamowitz on his unusual hobby. Then there's the Middle East album, a veritable assortment of dictators, fallen and felled. Among the likes of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Yasser Arafat and Hosni Mubarak is Moammar Gadhafi, whose ignoble death last month earned Schlamowitz himself a bit of instant fame. Schlamowitz's collection -- he says he has more than 6,000 letters and autographed photos -- had been written about before, but after Gadhafi died, everyone became curious about why an 81-year-old American corresponded with the despot. To answer that question, Schlamowitz takes his questioners back to 1953, when he was a young Army private in Korea. His buddy had a sole Christmas card left and Schlamowitz decided he would send it to Truman. ""He won't reply to me,"" Schlamowitz thought. ""I'm nobody special."" But his friend insisted he mail it. ""What do you have to lose?"" he said. His friend thought wisely, it turns out. A month and a half later, came the response, on presidential stationery. Schlamowitz was inspired. If Truman can write back, why not others? Back in New York, he married, had a daughter, and worked for 35 years designing floral arrangements first at a Manhattan shop, then closer to home in Brooklyn. When he saw someone in the news, he looked up the person's address and dropped a letter in the mail. He was especially fond of politicians and world leaders. He wrote to Gadhafi, then a young colonel who had usurped power in Libya in 1969 through a military coup. He asked for a signed photograph. ""I found his name in the papers,"" Schlamowitz says, sitting at a cluttered table surrounded by metal folding chairs. ""I wished him well."" He got his photo and a letter that said: ""Your kind message to Col. Moammar Gadhafi, leader of the great first September revolution, has been received with great appreciation."" Schlamowitz, a devout Jew, even received a Christmas card from the Muslim Gadhafi. Gadhafi wrote several times more; one letter attacked America for practicing terrorism with its support of Israel -- not what a Jewish man who also had letters from Israel's Golda Meir, Yitzhak Rabin and Moshe Dayan would want to read. ""America practices terrorism against the Palestinian people through providing Israel with the planes and weapons for attacking the Palestinian camps. America's countering of those people's struggle is a crime against humanity and liberty,"" Gadhafi wrote. Schlamowitz put the typewritten words into the album, alongside photos of Gadhafi, autographed in red ink. But he stopped writing to Gadhafi, he says, after the 1988 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. ""They were shooting down a plane killing innocent people,"" he says. He didn't want to be ""mixed up with individuals who were committing crimes against humanity."" After the Libyan uprising was well under way, Schlamowitz felt an urge to write again. ""If you don't do the right thing for your people and for your country, eventually your people will turn against you,"" he told the dictator. The letter was returned to him, unopened. ""He should have stepped down like the president of Egypt,"" Schlamowitz says. ""Maybe he would be alive today. But power, it's not that easy to give it up."" If Schlamowitz's correspondence has intrigued the public, it has certainly raised eyebrows in the halls of intelligence. He says he's been visited by the CIA, FBI and Homeland Security a number of times. They told him his name keeps popping up in Washington. They wanted to know what his connection was to some of these men, considered enemies of America. Schlamowitz explained it was no big deal. That he just wanted to write to them and maybe get a photo to hang on his otherwise drab walls. ""You look like a clean-cut fellow,"" a CIA agent once told him. ""It's a hell of a hobby you have, Schlamowitz."" Schlamowitz has sold only a few of his prized possessions. Two letters from Marilyn Monroe fetched $500. A Christmas card from Jackie and JFK, $50. Someone once offered him $35,000 for the whole collection. He wanted to pay him $10,000 up front and the rest after an auction. The problem was the advance was a personal check. Schlamowitz wasn't going to take that chance. Cash only, he says. Three years ago, a guy from Brooklyn offered him a dollar for each piece he owned. ""You must be sick,"" Schlamowitz told him. ""And I am even sicker dealing with you."" Schlamowitz has no idea what his collection is worth, but he knew when he was getting ripped off. He's thankful for his daughter and grandchildren. They are sure to take good care of his treasure trove after he is gone. Lately, he hasn't been writing as much. His hand gives way, he says. Tough to keep it all going at his age. He doesn't know why reporters called on him so much, though he certainly enjoys showing off his stuff. ""I'm nobody special,"" he says. ""I just want to be a part of history.""

"(CNN) -- Navigating a narrow channel through the reef, our Zodiacs slide onto a crushed coral beach and we scramble onto Mature-vavao, an uninhabited atoll at the eastern edge of French Polynesia. It's a gorgeous little island, shaded by thousands of coconut palms and encircled by bands of water that run a dozen different shades of blue. Expedition leader Jack Grove thinks this might be the first time a cruise ship has ever visited the island and there's a good chance nobody has set foot on the atoll in 30 years. The landing party turns left along the shore. But I blaze my own path straight ahead to the lagoon that dominates the middle of the island. Boobies, terns and other seabirds pay me scant attention. Most have probably never seen a person. Wading into the lagoon to cool off and spy on the tropical fish, I'm overcome by the sense I'm one of the few people who has ever set foot on this small patch of planet Earth. It's as close as I'll ever come to the emotion that Neil Armstrong must have felt when he first set foot on the moon, or the rush that mariners like Magellan and Cook no doubt got when they came across terra incognita. Discovering the remote . But that's what this cruise is all about. A three-week journey between Easter Island and Tahiti, it calls on some of the world's most remote and least-visited islands. Organized by Seattle-based Zegrahm Expeditions, the voyage includes gourmet cuisine, top-notch lecturers and a bartender who can make even the most obscure cocktails. But the real reason that 60-odd passengers have paid five figures for this cruise is geographical bragging rights -- a chance to boast to friends and colleagues back home that you've hobnobbed with Fletcher Christian's kinfolk on Pitcairn, explored ancient Polynesian cave dwellings on Henderson Island and frolicked with manta rays off Hiva Oa before visiting Paul Gauguin's grave on the same secluded island. You know a cruise is something special when your fellow passengers include renowned marine archeologist Jim Delgado and best-selling author and shipwreck detective Clive Cussler. Even for men like these, with all the adventures already under their belts, the voyage is unique. We're three days out from Easter Island before land is spotted again -- uninhabited Ducie Island, a small atoll in what really is the middle of nowhere. Tumbling into the water, I explore the reef with Jack Grove, one of Zegrahm's founders and a veteran marine biologist. Grove wants to show us something he found 25 years ago -- three rusty anchors -- all that remains of the mail ship ""Acadia,"" which ran aground on Ducie in 1881. An incredible array of sea life floats around the wreck -- Moorish idols, butterflies, turquoise parrots and white tip reef sharks that warily watch us from afar. Island stops . The following day we land on Henderson Island, an uplifted coral block that resembles a huge white table that's emerged from the ocean. Other than odd geology, the island's claim to fame is the real-life ""Moby-Dick."" When the American whaler ""Essex"" was rammed and sunk by a sperm whale in 1820, this is where the survivors took refuge. (No, their captain wasn't named Ahab.) But those shipwrecked whalers weren't the first residents. I follow expedition anthropologist Campbell up a cliff face and into a cave where there's evidence of long-ago human occupation -- a fire pit and stone scraping tool. ""We don't know for sure,"" says Campbell, ""because nobody was around to record their history, but we think a small Polynesian colony existed here more than 500 years ago."" Pitcairn is the first populated island we come across in nearly a week. And it's just barely inhabited -- roughly 50 people, nearly all of them related to Fletcher Christian and other ""Bounty"" mutineers. It's a strange little corner of the British Empire, with a long and sometimes dark history. The only way to land on Pitcairn is literally surfing 12-foot waves into the tiny, jetty-enclosed harbor. From there it's an uphill climb to Adamstown, the only settlement, where the residents greet us with a fish-and-chips lunch, cold beer and open-air craft stalls hawking Pitcairn flags, postage stamps, organic honey and ""Bounty"" replicas -- one of the islanders' only means of making foreign exchange. One of those I meet at lunch is seventh generation Pitcairn resident Andrew Christian, who invites me to hop on the back of his ATV for a spin around the steep volcanic isle. Covered in tattoos and body piercings, he seems every bit as roguish as his mutinous ancestor. Like most everyone on the island, Christian is a jack of several trades: DJ and photographer, government warehouse supervisor and cemetery caretaker, black pearl jewelry artist and website creator. His mountaintop home looks out over the vast Pacific, both an inspiring view and a constant reminder of how isolated Pitcairn remains even in the 21st century. Spear throwing and octopi . From Pitcairn we sail north towards the Marquesas Islands, calling on several isolated atolls along the eastern edge of French Polynesia. The residents of Puka Rua entertain us with a spear-throwing contest and a demonstration of barehanded octopus fishing. In the tiny Catholic church on Puka Puka -- the first island that Magellan spotted on his trans-Pacific passage -- local Jim Galindo spontaneously bursts into a Latin hymn he remembers from his choir boy days. The fabled Marquesas finally come into view near the end of our second week at sea. Like something out of ""King Kong,"" towering volcanic pillars and jungle-shrouded cliffs mark the entrance to the Bay of Virgins on Fatu Hiva island. Rising behind the shore are cloud-shrouded heights that look as if they just might harbor giant apes or some other mystical creature. But the most menacing thing we encounter hiking into the Fatu Hiva highlands is a pond full of spotted, foot-long eels. Grove tries to catch one with his bare hands, but they're far too slippery. Further up the trail we come across the remains of three old marae -- shrines made from dark volcanic stones and now almost hidden by the jungle. This spot was somehow sacred to the ancient Polynesians who built these temples. Perhaps they thought their gods lived up here or maybe it was the splendid isolation. We explore even higher, bushwhacking our way with machetes to the base of a colossal cliff laced with veil-thin waterfalls. Nearby is a natural rock pool that offers liquid relief from the sweaty uphill climb. Nobody, not even Grove, has been here before or even knew it existed. Lying on my back in the water, staring up at the misty volcanic peaks, I find myself wondering yet again how many human beings have ever been here.

"Vardzia, Georgia (CNN) -- In an isolated mountain valley on the southern edge of the former Soviet Union stands a cliff honey-combed with caves. This is Vardzia -- a cave monastery built in the 12th century by Georgian kings and queens. In the 800 years since its construction, Vardzia has been destroyed by an earthquake and further damaged by invading armies. In the final days of winter, when snow coats the surrounding peaks, the caves look all but deserted. But Vardzia does have several permanent residents: seven Orthodox monks who have become the de-facto guardians of this ancient site. They live much like their ancestors did, in spartan cave dwellings on the side of the cliff. They draw their water from a spring deep within the mountain that is only accessible via a series of tunnels. The well is called ""Tamar's Tears,"" after Queen Tamar, who completed construction of Vardzia eight centuries ago after the death of her father King Giorgi. Uncorking Georgia's wine heritage . One of the monks who lives in the cliff is Father Lazar. He roams the tunnels and staircases that hug the cliff-side, dressed in flowing black robes. Though he is only 28, his thick beard and pony-tail make him look far older. ""It puts joy in my heart to live here,"" the priest says, as he looks out of the doorway of his incense-scented cave at the rushing river below, where he sometimes fishes for trout. ""In the winter this is a quiet place. The frost sets in and the trees die. It is a holy place. A spiritual place."" In fact, Father Lazar says aside from the monks, the only other people who live in this valley, are the nuns who inhabit a small convent beyond a bend in the river. Speaking a mixture of Georgian, Russian and English, the monk takes visitors on a small tour of the complex, pointing out the remnants of an irrigation system that once provided water to up to 30,000 residents. He also shows Vardzia's crown jewels: two cave chapels whose domed ceilings are hewn directly out of the rock. The domes are coated with ornate,  icons, from the 8th century, depicting saints, Georgian royalty, and the dog-shaped demons that await the damned on Judgment Day. In the summer, the monks endure a different kind of torment which disturbs their ascetic mountain life: tourists. ""For the priests, it is not very good because they make a lot of noise,"" Father Lazar says. ""Different kinds of tourists come here, some of them yell a lot and run around here and there. They holler."" Vardzia has long been a tourist destination for hardy tourists willing to brave hours of driving down pot-holed mountain roads. But road crews are now re-paving the road - and there are big plans to further develop this quiet corner of Georgia. ""Visitors to Georgia are going to Vardzia and there is no infrastructure there at all,"" says Tengiz Bendukidze, an executive with Rakeen, an Emirati real estate development company. ""That's why Rakeen is going to invest up to 20 million dollars. And we are going to build a 4-star hotel and villas also."" There are big hopes that through tourism, Georgia can overcome the chaos and conflict of nearly two decades of post-Soviet independence. In years gone by, this small Caucasus country was a prize destination, due to its unique combination of rich cuisine, ancient mountain-top monasteries, Black Sea coast line and full-throated polyphonic choral music. ""During the Soviet era, Georgia was the number one tourist attraction for almost all the Soviet Union,"" said Nika Gilauri, the prime minister of Georgia, in an interview with CNN. ""We are getting back now this title for the region."" Executives at Rakeen say they are still working out the final concept of the new Vardzia hotel project. ""The main attraction is the caves. The cave city. And also we'll include [a] service package like hunting, rafting, camping and stuff like that,"" says Bendukidze. The new hotel is expected to be constructed on a hillside directly across the river from the cave complex, on a patch of territory that was occupied by a Soviet-era hotel until it was demolished a few years ago. Father Lazar has little positive to say about the old communist hotel...or its capitalist replacement. ""It's a bad idea to build a big hotel right there, directly across from Vardzia,"" he says. ""If there's going to be a bar or a night club there, then that's also not good."" But, he concedes, the tourists will probably appreciate the view.","Vardzia is an isolated mountain valley, home to a 12th century cave monastery .

"(CNN) -- Seattle is bigger, but Portland's scrappy supporters pushed the Oregon city to a win in the latest CNN.com city smackdown. The voting in our unscientific poll was neck and neck. Portland edged out Seattle with 52% of the vote, but despite that narrow margin, Portland fans came out with much greater force and enthusiasm to defend the City of Roses. iReporter Clinton Wood, who lives outside Portland in Tualatin, Oregon, acknowledges that Seattle is prettier than Portland. ""Well let's face it, Seattle is perhaps in the most beautiful location in the continental United States. But does physical beauty make it a better city?"" Absolutely not, Wood claims in his defense of Portland, and goes on to list why ""Portland thumps Seattle."" Among his reasons: Portland has more park space, much better mass transit, a stronger bicycling culture and proximity to superior skiing, a renowned Pinot Noir wine region and great areas for water sports. Plus, the weather's better. Seattle's beauty is not so easily dismissed by iReporter Jane Crummett. ""I lived on Bainbridge Island, Washington, 'backyard of the Emerald City,' for many years. The ferry system never got boring, and every time I rode the ferry I was dazzled by the beauty of the Puget Sound,"" says Crummett, who lived in the Seattle area for 12 years before moving to Charlotte, North Carolina. Seattle resident Jessa Moon is a bit conflicted. ""While I love Seattle, let's be clear, Portland is my city,"" writes Moon, who grew up in Portland. PORTLAND . Moon names Last Thursday, a street fair held on the last Thursday of each month, as an example of what she loves about Portland. Hippies and yuppies rub shoulders during the event held on Alberta Street in Northeast Portland, and ""hipsters showcase their latest patched vintage tweed jacket and creative take on facial hair to crowds that take in food truck fare, art, hand-sewn sock puppets, glass blown jars and any other obscure item your heart might ever have desired,"" Moon writes. The Portland Saturday Market, an outdoor artists market open every Saturday and Sunday, also receives a thumbs up from several CNN.com readers. Local Vern Baker and his wife are brunch aficionados. ""Brunch is one of our favorite food groups,"" he says. For Portland-style brunch, Baker recommends Sanborn's, Genies Cafe, Zell's Cafe, The Country Cat and Cadillac Cafe. Commenter Laura Minnick says Cameo Cafe has the best breakfast in town ""hands down."" For delicious coffee, Baker's votes go to Sisters Coffee Company and Stumptown Coffee Roasters.

"Orlando, Florida (CNN) -- More than 8 million American children live in food-insecure households, according to the USDA. That essentially means those kids might not know where their next meal will be coming from. They are at risk of hunger. Moving to Orlando 10 years ago from England and discovering these statistics about a country that is classified as a superpower was quite the shock. My husband, Justin, was born in South Africa, and we had made frequent trips there to visit family, to a country where poverty and hunger were well-documented. But this level of hunger in the United States of America? How could that be? Certainly not from lack of food, as in Africa. Perhaps just a shockingly bad distribution of food. And just as importantly, the wrong kind of food. But that's a whole other minefield that is the fast food culture. My husband is a professional golfer on the European and PGA Tours and the reigning U.S. Open Champion. In his search for excellence, we had long understood that as an athlete, there is a direct correlation between the quality (and quantity) of what you put into your body and the quality of your energy, concentration and performance. But it was in 2009 when we had our first child, Leo, that the immediacy of the food-behaviour correlation, particularly in children, really jumped out at us. If snacks were super sugary or meals were skipped, there was an immediate impact upon our toddler's behaviour. Getting the right balance of protein for growth, essential fats for brain development and balanced glucose levels for energy, mood and behavior -- well, it's everything. We began to question how on earth children could possibly be expected to perform at school without having adequate nutrition. Before Justin and I could even start thinking about how to assist in the educating of our local underprivileged children, we first had to figure out how to make sure they had enough food. Thanks to the federally funded food program, many American children in need receive free breakfasts and lunches at school. But what happens to these same children on the weekends? Through serving on the board of the PGA Tour Wives Association, an organization that has given back more than $5 million over the past 25 years, I have had the opportunity to work with numerous charities across the country while we traveled on the PGA Tour. One of those nonprofit organizations, Blessings in a Backpack, delivered a powerful and simple answer to our question. Blessings in a Backpack provides food for elementary school children across America who may otherwise have little or no food to eat on the weekends during the school year, for only $100 per child per year. The charity serves more than 63,000 children across America. Some 1,600 of those children are in our hometown of Orlando and are funded by money raised by our generous community at an event Justin and I host each year. We have had the opportunity to get to know some of these children and see their smiles light up their face when they receive their backpack of food each Friday, feel their arms hug us tight in gratitude and hear some of their personal stories. Like how the food in the backpack doesn't only nourish them throughout the weekend, but some of it goes in the family soup to feed all their siblings as well. Or how they're so glad they have more to eat on the weekends than the toothpaste they previously only had to eat. As a mother, how can that not break your heart? As a father, how can that not inspire you to want to do more for these precious, innocent children? So we were moved to set up the imaginatively titled Kate and Justin Rose Foundation. Our aim is to inspire children from the inside out through nutrition, education and experiences. Our organization has developed from feeding children in need from five schools on the weekends to creating vegetable gardens at school where they learn to grow fresh vegetables that they can then take home with them, to providing the children with a monthly allowance so they can choose their own books, to setting up field trips to broaden their horizons. It's all we can manage to do at this moment in our lives; a busy time of raising young children, supporting Justin while he tries to fulfill his potential and compete at the highest level and keeping our children connected with our own family spread across the continents. There's so much more we want to do, but childhood hunger in the U.S. is a huge problem to tackle! We are chipping away slowly at some issues we can see in our Florida backyard. Feeding, educating and nourishing one child at a time. And showing a child that someone out there cares. We can all do something. And a little something can make a big difference in the life of a child.","More than 8 million children in the U.S. are at risk of hunger .

"(CNN) -- Russian troops advanced out of two breakaway Georgian regions on Monday as the outnumbered and underequipped troops from the former Soviet republic retreated to defend the capital of Tbilisi. Georgian soldiers on a tank watch a Russian attack on a convoy outside Gori on Monday. If Russia brings its full military might to bear on its former satellite state, the Georgian military could find itself overcome quickly. Jane's Information Group, the British-based defense publications and military intelligence company, shows the Georgian military would be trying to hold off a force more than 20 times its size. Russia has about 641,000 in its armed forces, 320,000 of whom are in the army -- most of them conscripts who traditionally fare poorly against a motivated opponent, according to Jane's. Low morale, poor management, inefficiency and inflexibility are cited as problems by Jane's.  Watch how Russia takes over Georgian city » . About 26,000 are in the Georgian military, and about 17,000 of them are in the army, which has had the benefit of four years of training by the U.S. Marines, Army and Special Forces, according to Jane's. Georgia has been trying to form a professional military force and by the end of next year expected to have only a small number of conscripts in its main force, Jane's said. Those forces would be using almost all Soviet-era weaponry. The Tbilisi government has been seeking western armaments but has been told by Washington that forces must be able to use the old weapons proficiently before they get new ones, Jane's reported. Even with those old weapons, Georgia doesn't have much to work with. Its best tanks are Soviet-era T-72s, of which it has about 80, according to Jane's. The Georgian army has about 150 armored personnel carriers and infantry fighting vehicles and a similar number of artillery pieces. The sharp end of the Georgian air force consists of seven aging Su-25 ground attack fighters and seven attack helicopters, according to Jane's. Russia's weaponry is formidable. It has about 7,000 tanks, 7,000 infantry fighting vehicles and armored personnel carriers and thousands of pieces of artillery, Jane's reports. In the air, Russia can bring 650 multirole or ground attack aircraft to the battle, as well as 500 attack helicopters. Georgia has 150 surface-to-air missiles to use in the fight, according to Jane's. Of course, Russia's military is spread across a country of 10.58 million square miles (17 million square kilometers), 243 times the size of Georgia.

"London (CNN) -- A notebook full of work-in-progress versions of some of Dylan Thomas's key poems has been rediscovered more than 70 years after the poet's mother-in-law ordered it to be burnt. The book, in Thomas's cramped, neat handwriting, includes 19 poems in varying states of completion, some with large sections scratched out and revised, and offers a valuable insight into his creative process. Hailed as a ""terrific discovery"" by one leading Thomas expert, the workbook is set to sell at auction for upwards of Â£100,000 ($156,430), capping off the writer's centenary year and tantalizing poetry scholars around the world. Thomas, one of the leading poets of the 20th Century, is thought to have discarded the notebook during a stay at the home of his mother-in-law, Yvonne Macnamara, at some point in the late 1930s. Thomas and Macnamara did not get on, and he wrote to a friend of his dislike for both her and the place -- Blashford in Hampshire -- in southern England. ""This flat English country levels the intelligence, planes down the imagination, narrows the a's, my ears belch up old wax and misremembered passages of misunderstood music, I sit and hate my mother-in-law, glowering at her from corners and grumbling about her in the sad, sticky, quiet of the lavatory."" Macnamara gave the workbook to her maid, Louie King, and told her to dispose of it, but King opted to save it from the flames, and instead stashed it away for decades. A handwritten note from King on the cover explains: ""This Book of Poetry by Dylan Thomas was with a lot of papers given to me to burn in the kitchen boiler. I saved it and forgot all about it until I read of his death ..."" King died in 1984, and the book has remained among her family's possessions, hidden away in a drawer ever since, and unknown to Thomas scholars who pore over every other scrap of his work. John Goodby, the editor of Thomas's ""Collected Poems,"" said the discovery was ""probably the most significant find since Thomas's death in 1953 when various papers were bought up, and perhaps even since 1941, when he sold some of his notebooks to the University at Buffalo. ""For some of the poems included, we've never had manuscript versions before, and they show significant changes were made; most of them are fair copies of finished poems, but some are more like worksheets -- they allow us to see how he arrived at a certain phrase, to see what he's up to."" All the works included eventually made it into print, some in his first collection, ""18 Poems,"" in 1934, and the rest in his second anthology, ""25 Poems,"" in 1936, which suggests the manuscript dates to a critical point in his life. ""At this particular period in his career, his works are like abstract paintings or music: everything is about the words, the language -- they're not anecdotes or narratives,"" he explained, adding that Thomas had likely discarded the notebook because all the poems in it had been published: ""He'd used it up. He was always leaving things behind."" As literature fans in Thomas's native Wales and around the world celebrate the centenary of his birth, the notebook is being put up for sale at Sotheby's auction house in London in December, where it is expected to go under the hammer for between Â£100,000 and Â£150,000 ($156,430 to $234,640). Rosie Chester, of Sotheby's, said that as a ""way of understanding Dylan Thomas's writing process"" it was likely to appeal to anyone with a love of his work. ""It will be very exciting to see where it ends up,"" she told CNN. Goodby, professor of English language and literature at the University of Swansea (Thomas's hometown) said major libraries and university collections around the world would love to own the book. ""Personally, I'd like to see the National Library of Wales or the British Library put in a bid, to stop it from leaving the country, if possible,"" he said. The University at Buffalo, New York, and the Harry Ransom Center in Austin, Texas -- both already home to large Dylan Thomas collections -- may also take an interest, Goodby added. ""From my point of view the worst thing would be for it to end up in the hands of a private collector who locks it up in a bank vault for 50 years,"" he said, admitting he was desperate to get a closer look at the book after being given a sneak peek ahead of the sale. ""It was hard to keep my hands off it -- I just want to pore through it, to be able to read every word in his crabbed, backwards-sloping hand -- it is such a covetable object."" Dylan Thomas was born in Swansea, south Wales, in 1914; he found fame with his ""play for voices,"" ""Under Milk Wood,"" and poems including ""Fern Hill"" and ""Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night."" Thomas was also known for his hard-drinking lifestyle. He collapsed at New York's Chelsea Hotel in 1953, shortly after reportedly announcing: ""I've had 18 straight whiskies. I think that's the record!"" and died in hospital several days later.","A long-lost notebook full of poems by Dylan Thomas is to be sold at auction .

"Havana (CNN) -- More than 50 years after the fact, Cuba has published the diary that Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara kept during the armed struggle he waged alongside Fidel Castro from the Sierra Maestra mountains. ""Diary of a Combatant"" recounts Guevara's experiences after coming ashore in Cuba on December 2, 1956, until shortly before the rebels declared victory on January 1, 1959. According to Guevara's widow, Aleida March, the goal is ""to show his work, his thoughts, his life, so that the Cuban people and the entire world get to know him and don't distort things anymore."" The book was edited by the Che Guevara Studies Center, which is directed by March, and published by Australia's Ocean Press/Ocean Sur. Researchers said Guevara kept his diary in hand-written notebooks and that part of the reason they had put off publishing the diary was that some of the notebooks were missing. ""Where are the notebooks? We don't know and there are a lot of different versions,"" Maria del Carmen Ariet, a leading researcher from the Che Guevara Studies Center, said at a press conference to launch the book. But she also said that much of the material was included in ""Episodes of the Cuban Revolutionary War,"" a more polished account of his time in the Sierra Maestra mountains that Guevara published in 1963. ""We'd have to ask if he really wanted the 'Diary of a Combatant' published,"" she said. Some of Guevara's other diaries have been commercially successful, most notably ""The Motorcycle Diaries,"" the memoir of a 23-year-old medical student on a road trip in Latin America. Guevara was born in Argentina in 1928 and met Castro in 1955 in Mexico City, where he was plotting his return to Cuba to overthrow Fulgencio Batista. During the guerrilla fighting in the mountains, Guevara was the first subordinate to be promoted to the rank of ""comandante"" by Castro. He went on to become Cuba¹s Central Bank chief before heading to Africa and then Bolivia to continue armed struggles. He was killed in 1967.","Hand-written notebooks cover time spent fighting alongside Castro .

"(CNN) -- Debate over guns continues to inflame the nation, especially after the mass killings in a Connecticut school late last year that prompted President Barack Obama to seek new federal restrictions. Obama's efforts have stalled, but several states are now redefining their own laws for firearms. Those measures run the gamut. On one hand, New York toughed its gun laws. But in one extreme, Missouri sought to effectively obliterate federal gun laws, which eventually failed. The state-by-state battles seemingly favor Second Amendment adherents, led by the National Rifle Association, said one analyst who lives in Colorado, which this week saw a successful recall election against two state politicians supporting gun control. So far in these major controversies, ""the gun lobby has won the policy victories,"" left-leaning commentator and columnist David Sirota of Denver told CNN. Missouri . Nowhere were federal gun laws under greater attack this month than in Missouri: lawmakers sought to essentially void federal gun laws in the state. The Republican-led Legislature passed a bill that they said would protect the rights of gun owners, but Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, vetoed the measure. State legislators so far have been unable to muster enough votes to override the veto. The Missouri proposal was an eye opener: It would have technically allowed residents to own a machine gun. It also would have made it a crime to enforce background checks or publish the name and address of a gun owner. And citizens could have taken legal action against police who try to enforce federal gun laws. Ohio, Minnesota and Texas pursued similar bills as an apparent backlash against federal gun control attempts. Nixon declared he ""has consistently signed bills expanding the rights of gun owners in Missouri,"" but the state Republicans' measure was just too much -- an ""unnecessary and unconstitutional attempt to nullify federal laws,"" in his words. Iowa . Should the blind be shooting guns? The issue recently arose in Iowa when the Des Moines Register exposed how state law allows blind people to receive permits to acquire or carry guns in public. Iowa's definition of blindness is explicit: anyone who is legally or completely blind. Federal laws don't prohibit blind people from owning guns, but some states regulate their ability to acquire firearms. Nebraska, for example, requires a ""proof of vision"" before issuing a permit to carry a concealed handgun: that proof can be a driver's license or an eye doctor's statement. But the Iowa law -- similar to one in Wisconsin -- divides advocates for disabled people and the police. Blind singer Stevie Wonder found such gun ownership absurd: ""Imagine me with a gun,"" he told CNN earlier this year. ""It's just crazy."" Colorado . In what some view as evidence of the gun lobby's might, two Democratic state senators were kicked out of office in a recall election this week. The election -- controversial in itself because it was the first-ever at a state level -- was initiated after the two voted in favor of new gun control laws. The new laws, effective last July, limit firearm ammunition magazines to 15 rounds and require universal background checks on all firearm sales. The recall was viewed as a battleground between gun rights activists and gun control advocates. It was just in July 2012 that a mass shooting killed 12 people and wounded 58 others in a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado. The new gun laws polarized Colorado along party lines: Democratic voters supported them, but Republican voters opposed them, a Quinnipiac University poll said last month. In the recall, the powerful gun lobby, the National Rifle Association, spent between $400,000 and $500,000 to oust the Democratic lawmakers. The NRA denied it initiated a national effort to oust the two lawmakers, saying it was fundamentally ""a local effort,"" the group told CNN. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a billionaire and major proponent of gun control, spent $350,000 to keep the Colorado lawmakers in office. Gun control advocates, however, charged the recall was successful because of ""the shadowy maneuvers of the corporate gun lobby and a handful of extremists,"" said Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Stop Gun Violence. Texas . Texas lawmakers pushed a series of bills that would make it easier and cheaper to own and carry a gun in that state. The legislators initiated the blitz on the same weekend that the National Rifle Association held its annual convention in Houston last May, CNN affiliate KTXA reported. At least two of those measures were signed into law by Gov. Rick Perry: it's now easier for a person to renew a license to carry a concealed handgun, and veterans and peace officer now pay a lower fee for concealed handgun licenses. One measure that stalled, however, is a Missouri-like proposal that would prohibit any state employee from enforcing federal gun laws -- such as capacity limitation or registration requirements -- that don't exist under state law. ""The Second Amendment is the amendment that keeps the people free,"" said Tea Party Republican state Rep. Steve Toth, who sponsored that stalled bill, according to KTXA. 5 things to know about guns . New York . A month after the Connecticut school mass shooting, New York became the first in the nation to create new laws imposing mental health regulations on firearm ownership. The laws fortify New York's existing assault weapons ban, limit ammunition magazines' capacity to seven bullets rather than 10 and strengthen rules that govern the mentally ill, which includes a requirement to report potentially harmful behavior. Newtown, Connecticut . The postcard-worthy town of Newtown -- devastated last December by the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary that killed 20 children, all aged 6 or 7, and six adults -- is now seeing an upswing in gun permits. With 27,000 residents, Newtown issued 171 pistol permits last year and 209 permits so far this year, on pace to double the 2012 figure. Meanwhile,Connecticut passed this year new gun laws that are among the toughest in the country. They add more than 100 guns to its list of banned assault weapons and limit the capacity of magazines to 10 rounds. They also mandate the creation of the nation's first statewide registry of people convicted of crimes involving the use or threat of a dangerous weapon, among other things. Nevertheless, the new gun controls prompted some residents to get gun permits. ""Fear did not prompt me,"" said Nancy Elis, a widow and grandmother who lived in Newtown for 28 years before recently moving to the nearby town of Southbury. This year, she got a gun permit. ""When I started to hear all the gun control talk, that's what prompted me,"" Elis told CNN. ""Our rights are being slowly infringed upon and that this whole idea of controlling guns has come to my backdoor."" Now she wants to own a gun, she said, because ""there may be a time when I may never be able to get a firearm."" Has the moment passed? Why gun control push fizzled . CNN's Leigh Ann Caldwell and Poppy Harlow contributed to this report.","With President Obama's gun control effort stalled, states address the gun issue .

Richard meets U.S. President Jimmy Carter during Quest for Peace. The year began with a search for poise and rhythm -- the art of dancing. We soon discovered that Quest was no Fred Astaire. Yet, with the help of some of the world's best movers and shakers, he managed to Cha Cha and Rumba his way onto the television phenomenon ""Dancing with the Stars"", in front of 10,000 people.

Watch Quest for the environment » . On Quest for Rock 'n' Roll, it became clear that the music was only part of the story -- it's what lies behind it, that's equally important. It is a genre that speaks of freedom and rebellion -- an important voice to challenge the status quo. This spirit was perfectly epitomized by movie actress Juliette Lewis who has swapped Hollywood for a life on the road with her band. There is, of course, a dark side to the industry that couldn't be ignored -- Nikki Sixx of the 80s band Motley Crue, gave us a fascinating insight into the self-destructive nature of the cliched lifestyle that so nearly killed him.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Tired of bumping into people glued to their phones? One Chinese city thinks it has the answer: It has divided a sidewalk on one of its busiest streets into two lanes -- one for cellphone users and the other for those without. The sidewalk is in the city of Chongqing in southwestern China. Fifty meters long and three meters wide, it has warning signs painted in white on the ground. Long Cheng, a spokesperson for the developer that came up with the idea, said that the sidewalk lanes reminded tourists not to walk while playing with their cellphones. ""It's an unsafe gesture with potential safety hazards,"" she said. The road, known as ""yangrenjie"" or foreigners street, is a popular tourist attraction in the city because of its faux Western architecture and an amusement park. Long said the developers were inspired by a recent experiment in Washington DC and there were no plans yet to roll out the concept elsewhere in the city. Not all pedestrians were sold on the idea, however. ""This kind of sidewalk is not a fundamental solution and could be an indulgence for mobile phone addicts in the long run, in my mind -- and this could even lead to more problems in the future,"" Xing Xing told the China Daily.

"(CNN) -- Nigeria's president Goodluck Jonathan has suspended the national soccer team from international competition for two years after their dismal performance at the World Cup. Nigeria came bottom of Group B at the tournament in South Africa, losing to Argentina and Greece before drawing with South Korea. Now president Jonathan has dissolved the Nigerian Football Federation and removed the ""Super Eagles"" from the international circuit, meaning sanctions could follow from soccer's governing body FIFA. Nigeria's Sports Minister Ibrahim Isa Bio confirmed the decision in an interview with CNN. ""The government has taken a decision we believe is in the interests of Nigeria that we should for now, withdraw from international competition because our football since 1996 seems not to be growing,"" he said. ""The government spends a lot of money to encourage football in Nigeria and we need to go back to the drawing board the way Ghana did two years ago. ""The president Goodluck Jonathan has endorsed this decision and the Nigerian people are excited about it. ""They are not happy with the performance [in the World Cup] and the Nigerian people believe the right thing to do is start all over again. We have informed FIFA of our intentions."" Earlier, Mr Isa Bio's spokesman, Olukayode Thomas, told CNN: ""Nigeria is a sovereign state and has the right to take a decision aimed at improving the nation. It's a decision that was taken by all Nigerians. We can't stand back and watch our football decline because of FIFA rules."" Thomas said an interim body has been established in the wake of the football federation's demise, and that new elections would be held shortly to appoint new officials. CNN anchor Pedro Pinto said the decision was also based on Nigeria's performance at the African Cup of Nations, as well as their organization of the under-17 World Cup. FIFA rules prevent governments from interfering in the running of national football federations, and on Wednesday president Sepp Blatter warned France on a similar issue. FIFA told CNN they had no official information on the matter, but that their ""position regarding political interference in football is well known."" Fulham midfielder Dickson Etuhu, who played every game in Nigeria's World Cup campaign, told CNN he was stunned by the decision. ""I'm so shocked at the moment I don't know what to say or how to react,"" he said. ""Obviously there's a lot of things that aren't right in Nigerian football, it should be doing a lot better than it is. I don't think banning us is going to help. ""With us coming out of the World Cup the way we did obviously there will be meetings about that because no-one will be happy. ""For me and the other players, no international football for two years is not something we'll be happy with because we all love playing for our country. I don't know how that's going to go down. ""You could say it's a bit extreme banning us for two years, but every country has a different way of handling their affairs and we have to respect the decision the president has made.""","Nigeria's president Goodluck Jonathan has suspended the national soccer team .

"Darrington, Washington (CNN) -- Pastor Gary Ray stood before his congregation Sunday, prepared for people to shake their fists at God. Such reactions in the only church in Oso, Washington, would have been entirely appropriate. After all, it was in this rural community -- between Arlington and Darrington, along State Route 530 -- that a mudslide last weekend ravaged the landscape, swallowing homes, killing at least 21 and leaving 30 still missing. Not a soul in the room, where the pastor guessed 115 gathered, had gone untouched by the horror that rocked their quiet world. Instead, amid the fear, the unknown and the hurt, the pastor of Oso Community Chapel was surprised by what people shared. ""I was expecting someone to say, 'I lost my brother or I lost my house and I'm angry' -- and that would have been OK,"" he said by phone Sunday. ""But today what we heard was, 'I was in trouble and a stranger stopped and helped me.'"" That looking out for each other, the coming together, is just one example of the good that can appear around the corner when tragedy strikes, he said. ""People say in times of disaster, it brings out the best and the worst in people. But I'm just seeing the best,"" he said. ""I'm seeing patience and sacrifice. Character is being developed. I don't know what the future holds, but I do hope for some unexpected blessings."" He's not alone. ""We are hoping for a miracle,"" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee told CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""We are going to do everything we can to look for that miracle and care for these (affected) families."" The number of people unaccounted for after the March 22 landslide dropped Saturday to 30 from 90, officials said. In addition to the 21 confirmed fatalities, another four bodies have been discovered in the debris field, Jason Biermann, a program manager for the Snohomish County Department of Emergency Management, said Sunday evening at a news conference. Inslee said officials would be in an active rescue mode as long as there was any possibility of finding survivors. The governor pointed to the deep grief the community feels, but said it also is very resilient and that he is amazed by acts of courage and inspiration by the people involved in search efforts. ""These people are showing some courage and resolution and they are hanging together too,"" he told CNN. ""This is a place that is pretty tough."" Inslee said the conditions searchers face are extremely difficult. Sometimes it takes five minutes just to go 50 feet, he said. Emergency management officials had said all week they expected the number of people unaccounted for would drop dramatically as residents of Darrington and nearby Oso turned up. ""We expected that number to drop in part due to a combination of finding people who registered as safe and well, and cross-referencing the list with confirmed identities of victims at the (medical examiner's) office,"" Biermann said. Biermann said the challenge of identifying victims is becoming more complicated as search operations continue. ""The slide hit with such force that the rescuers are not finding full, intact bodies,"" he said. Volunteers are also collecting family mementos from the debris so they can be cleaned and returned to their owners. Residents unite to help victims . Remembering the dead . On Saturday, residents and rescuers paused in the rain at 10:37 a.m., the exact time when a landslide forever changed their world a week earlier. That's when the mountain-size torrent of mud swept over a mile, knocking over homes and trees. In Saturday's moment of silence, officials eulogized the rural residents who lost their lives inside their homes or on the road when the hillside collapsed, after a month of ground-soaking rain, and obliterated everything in its path. ""Our community is changed forevermore,"" Darrington Mayor Dan Rankin told 40 people outside the fire station, where the flag fluttered at half-staff. ""It's going to take a long time to heal."" Indeed, even rescue crews at the disaster zone stopped work in the mud and observed the short vigil, said Steve Mason, a Snohomish County fire battalion chief. Dogs join search . Meanwhile, rescuers brought in more dogs -- both rescue and cadaver canines -- last week to search for buried survivors or bodies. Many of those dogs were rested on Sunday. Noting the stark reality of the ongoing search, Rankin said that Saturday's standstill of 30 seconds ""is all the rest we're going to get."" ""In our minds, we are in recovery mode. In our hearts, we are still in rescue mode,"" he added. At groceries, pharmacies and community centers in Snohomish County, residents stopped what they were doing and held the momentary vigil on a gray day that obscured the mountaintops. About eight miles down the North Fork of the Stillaguamish River from Oso -- where the landslide occurred -- a store cashier bowed his head in silence. Outside his Food Pavilion store in Arlington, shoppers also stopped, huddled around a cart, and looked solemnly at the ground. After 20 seconds of silence, the shopping resumed. Back at Darrington, about 15 miles from Oso, residents used Saturday's solemnity to recall what they were doing when the massive hillside came crashing down. Rankin was at a hardware store to buy screws for a weekend project. Then the credit card machines went down. Then came word of the landslide, with a home in its path. Pastor Michael De Luca was having coffee with the local barber in his shop at the time. ""A woman came through the door and asked for a cell phone. She wanted to make a call. She said, 'I was following a car and a slide pushed it off the road,'"" De Luca recounted. That's how locals began to learn of the catastrophe 60 miles northeast of Seattle. Watching the water and weather . While rescuers labored in the rain and slogged through mud Saturday and Sunday, officials said they were concerned about flooding in the nearby waterway. Kris Rietmann, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Transportation who gave updates Sunday on the effort on the eastern side of the slide, said the river had risen about 1 foot over the weekend. And, she said, a secondary road to the mudslide area was constructed to offer safer access for search crews. Meanwhile, ponds, too large to drain, formed in the debris field, said Biermann of the Snohomish County Emergency Management Service. The wet conditions have only made a difficult task that much harder. A break from the wet conditions, though, may finally be in the forecast. Mostly sunny skies are predicted in the days ahead.

"New York (CNN) -- People come up to Aimee Mullins all the time and say, ""you know, I have to tell you, you just don't look disabled."" The record-setting athlete, actress and model says, ""And it's sweet because I know that they're confused, and they're telling me this because they know I'm missing both legs from the shin down, but they're presented with this package of a highly capable young woman. This has happened all over the world. I tell them it's interesting because I don't feel disabled."" She believes that people are not born disabled. ""It's society that disables an individual by not investing in enough creativity to allow for someone to show us the quality that makes them rare and valuable and capable."" Mullins was born without fibula bones and was expected to use a wheelchair to get around. Her legs were amputated below the knees when she was a year old. She learned to walk, bike, swim and play sports using prosthetics. While a student at Georgetown University, she competed in the NCAA Division I, using pioneering carbon-fiber prosthetic devices designed to imitate the hind legs of a cheetah. At the Paralympics in 1996, she set world records in several track events, drawing attention that landed her on magazine covers and in one media ""best of"" list after another. Mullins was featured in a 1999 show by the late fashion designer Alexander McQueen and has gone on to a career as an actress. In an interview with CNN.com, she said she's beginning work on a screenplay about the life of scientist Rosalind Franklin, whose discoveries helped lead to the unlocking of the structure of DNA. In a talk at last year's TED MED conference in San Diego, Mullins explored the concept of disability and talked about how overcoming adversity is something everyone must confront, in one way or another. [TED is a nonprofit that distributes talks on a wide variety of subjects at http://www.ted.com/; TED MED is a separate organization that focuses on medical and health care related issues.] . Mullins spoke to CNN Monday. Here's an edited transcript: . CNN: You spoke at the TED MED conference about the negative connotations of the term ""disabled."" How important is it that we get the language right? Aimee Mullins: It's not so much the word itself. The idea of being politically correct is not the goal here. It's how we use the word very casually as a label to try to encompass somebody's value to our community and the worth of their contribution to our community. That's what we need to get right. I've had so many letters from parents or medical professionals who will say, I didn't even think about how casually I'll tell someone oh, I have a disabled child. It never even occurred to them that if they really stop to think about it, their child may have a specific medical condition that can be defined as paralysis or autism or being an amputee. ...it's how we use words and how they shape what we think about difference and other people in our community. CNN: In your own life, how significant have these kinds of words been? Mullins: Well for me I never ever felt the ownership or any identity with any community of disabilities. I didn't grow up being told that I was a disabled child. After the '96 games, and I was competing in Division I track at Georgetown and I was starting to get mainstream press ... where I'd be on the cover of a magazine that was heralding my speed and athletic prowess and it would say, ""Disabled athlete Aimee Mullins runs faster than most people on the planet with flesh and bone legs."" And I thought how does a journalist miss that, and just casually write ""disabled athlete."" I've had journalists asking me what do we call you -- is it handicapped , are you disabled, physically challenged? I said well hopefully you could just call me Aimee. But if you have to describe it, I'm a bilateral below the knee amputee. Ten years later, watching Oscar Pistorius go through many of the same issues I had 10-12 years ago, I realized that our language just hasn't caught up with the opportunities technology is providing for people... I feel like today there's a different sense, so much more widespread, of people feeling like they don't want to be negated, they don't want to be marginalized, they want to make their own definitions of their identity. They want to identify themselves. CNN: You have said that there's a stigma relating to differences between people. Do you think, just setting the word aside, is there still a stigma relating to physical limitations such as being an amputee? Mullins: There's much, much less of a stigma here. It's my own personal experience that parents of children today who are amputees have an entirely different view. I think a lot of this is because of the Internet. They have so much more access to information and to learn about what prosthetics are out there. And a sense of sheer numbers, to learn that you're not alone. ... I've been in developing countries where being an amputee and indeed having any kind of physical or intellectual or emotional disability is highly stigmatized. I was in Kibera [in Nairobi, Kenya], one of the largest slums in the world, last fall, and mothers of babies born with club feet are encouraged to abandon these children. If the babies are born with Down Syndrome, they're encouraged to abandon them. If the mother doesn't actually abandon the child, the child is kept in a backroom in a shack and literally does not see the light of day. And the child is not even counted. When I asked a mother how many children she had, she told me she had three, but there were four. I was sitting in their living room and her three year old had been born with his head enlarged and the rest of his body wasn't developing at the same rate. I had a really disturbing message from a doctor who was at TED MED and heard me speak and went to Haiti immediately after the earthquake -- he's an anesthesiologist. And he said, we have to talk because I have so many patients down here who are choosing death over amputation. And so I'm sure that part of the social stigma in a developing country when employment and work are already scarce, it's hard for people to imagine how they could support their family financially with a different body. CNN: How does technology play into this and how is it changing the lives of amputees? Mullins: Technology's a huge factor. There had been a real dearth of technological advancement since the last world war. ... I grew up as a teenager having this wonderful naivete about, well I can go see something that James Cameron dreamt up and [Oscar-winning visual effects designer] Stan Winston built it. Why can't I have that for my body? Or I would go into Madame Tussaud's wax museum and see the kind of artistry was done there for a leg. Why can't I combine that with Stan Winston's doing? Watch James Cameron's talk at TED2010 . It was a very lonely voice echoing in the wilderness... And I really think because of the two wars we are in right now and because of the fact that we have so many young men and women in this situation, it's unthinkable that we're willing to make a 19-year old irrelevant by not giving them their capabilities. And that's why you're seeing so many leaps in progress. Again with the growth of the Internet, so many more people are saying I found some designer in Silicon Valley who's using a 3-D printer to create a model of a prosthetic leg and customize it and print it out. There is that sense of possibility that's been so expanded because of technology and because so many more people have accepted this invitation to come into the conversation. I've had fashion designers, graphic designers, and communication designers, people who don't have engineering backgrounds, who don't have medical backgrounds, who are very intrigued by the idea of creating prosthetics for assistive devices... The idea of prosthetics is a tool. Most people's cell phones are prosthetics. If you leave your cell phone at home, you feel impacted by not having it. It's an important part of your daily function and what you can do in a day. CNN: How much of your own time do you devote to raising awareness about these issues? Mullins: I'm not an advocate for disability issues. Human issues are what interest me. You can't possibly speak for a diverse group of people. I don't know what it's like to be an arm amputee, or have even one flesh-and-bone leg, or to have cerebral palsy. I don't speak for such huge and diverse groups. What I've tried to do, what I've been fortunate to do, is to live my live and create my life as I've wanted to create it. To be able to live with such an autonomy has itself raised awareness.","Mullins set world records using prosthetic devices, she's an actress and model .

"(CNN) -- UNESCO on Saturday condemned the destruction of three sacred tombs in Timbuktu, Mali, by Islamic militants who say they will destroy more. The tombs, a 15th century shrine to Muslim saints, are part of a World Heritage site in Timbuktu. The destruction started Friday. ""The militants broke the doors and wooden gates to the grave and then used the cloth inside to set fire to the tomb,"" said Sankoum Sissoko, a resident in Timbuktu. ""They started chasing people away, telling them they shouldn't worship a saint, a human being."" He witnessed the attack together with other Timbuktu residents who had come to the tombs to pray. Timbuktu's treasures at risk . ""The Islamists know a lot of people visit the grave on Fridays. That's why they attack on those days,"" Sissoko said. UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova called for the militants to stop the destruction immediately. The U.N. agency sponsors cultural, scientific, and educational programs to further peaceful relations between nations. ""Reports that the Mausoleums of Sidi Mahmoud, Sidi Moctar and Alpha Moya have been destroyed is extremely distressing,"" she said. ""There is no justification for such wanton destruction and I call on all parties engaged in the conflict to stop these terrible and irreversible acts, to exercise their responsibility and protect this invaluable cultural heritage for future generations."" Timbuktu Muslims on their way to Friday worship at the tombs were stopped and threatened by armed men from Ansar Dine, a militant group that seeks to impose strict Sharia law, Timbuktu Mayor Ousmane Halle said. ""The Islamists have surrounded he tombs with their cars after chasing people away and at the moment they're destroying the mausoleum of Sidi El Moctar,"" Halle said. According to several witnesses the militants said they wouldn't stop until the destruction was complete. ""Today we will destroy all the mausoleums,"" Ansar Dine representative Sanda Ould Boumama said. Just on Thursday, the World Heritage Committee had accepted the request of the Malian government to place Timbuktu on UNESCO's sites in danger. France, the former colonial power in Mali, also condemned the attack. ""We call for an end to this violence and this intolerance,"" France said in a statement.

"Fort Meade, Maryland (CNN) -- Bradley Manning, the Army private whose disclosure of hundreds of thousands of U.S. military and diplomatic documents gave American officials a global case of heartburn, was sentenced to more than three decades in prison Wednesday. A military judge sentenced Manning to 35 years -- less than the 60 prosecutors sought and far shorter than the 90 he could have received -- minus credit for the about three and a half years he's already been behind bars. He showed little to no reaction when the judge, Army Col. Denise Lind, sentenced him at Fort Meade, outside Washington. But in a statement read by his attorney afterward, he said he acted ""out of a love for my country and a sense of duty,"" to expose what he said were abuses committed in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The attorney, David Coombs, said the statement was part of Manning's application for a pardon from President Barack Obama. ""If you deny my request for a pardon, I will serve my time knowing that sometimes you have to pay a heavy price to live in a free society,"" the statement said. ""I will gladly pay that price if it means we could have a country that is truly conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all women and men are created equal."" White House spokesman Josh Earnest had no comment on a possible pardon, saying only that Manning's request would be considered ""like any other application."" Manning's lawyer: He should not 'rot in jail' Manning, 25, was convicted in July of stealing 750,000 pages of classified documents and videos and disseminating them to WikiLeaks, the online anti-secrecy group. Lind also reduced his rank from private first class to private, ordered him to forfeit pay and benefits and be dishonorably discharged. ""We're still here fighting for you Bradley!"" a supporter yelled as Manning was hustled out of the courtroom. ""We love you Bradley!"" another said. An aunt and a cousin of Manning's wept openly in the courtroom. Manning was found guilty of 20 of the 22 charges against him, including violations of the U.S. Espionage Act. He avoided a potential life sentence when Lind rejected charges that his actions aided the enemy. Lind already had agreed to reduce Manning's sentence by 112 days after ruling that the harsh treatment he was subjected to in the brig at the Marine base in at Quantico, Virginia, was out of line. Manning will be eligible for parole in 10 years, Coombs said. In the meantime, he called on Obama ""to focus on protecting whistleblowers, instead of punishing them."" The sentencing wraps up a case of what prosecutors called the biggest leak of classified materials in Army history. The documents included field reports from Army units in Iraq and Afghanistan, video of a U.S. helicopter attack that killed two journalists in Iraq and unvarnished assessments of other countries' leaders by American diplomats overseas. Prosecutors have said Manning acted as a ""determined insider"" in leaking classified information about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, arguing his actions created grave risk, disrupted diplomatic missions and endangered lives. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who last week criticized what he called a ""forced"" apology by Manning, said the sentence was ""a significant tactical victory"" for the defense. But he called Manning's prosecution ""an affront to basic concepts of Western justice."" ""Mr. Manning's treatment has been intended to send a signal to people of conscience in the U.S. government who might seek to bring wrongdoing to light,"" Assange, now holed up in the Ecuador's embassy in London, said in a written statement. ""This strategy has spectacularly backfired, as recent months have proven. Instead, the Obama administration is demonstrating that there is no place in its system for people of conscience and principle. As a result, there will be a thousand more Bradley Mannings."" But the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Buck McKeon, criticized what he called a light sentence compared to the life terms some convicted spies have received. ""Bradley Manning betrayed his country, his obligations as a soldier and the trust of all Americans. He put the lives of our troops and our allies in danger,"" McKeon, R-California, said in a written statement. ""Given the vast damage he did to our national security and the need to send a strong signal to others who may be tempted to disclose classified information, this is a dangerous conclusion,"" McKeon added. Judge explains verdict . The disclosure of more than 250,000 cables from U.S. embassies in late 2010 came in for particular criticism, with State Department officials arguing the leaks would make it harder for Washington to get accurate appraisals of the countries where American diplomats work. A CNN analysis of the first batch of cables WikiLeaks published found 170 that named sources whose identity was meant to be protected. But in 2011, the human rights group Amnesty International said the leaked documents helped galvanize opposition to longtime Tunisian strongman Zine El Abedine Ben Ali by revealing the depth of his government's corruption. Ben Ali was toppled by a popular uprising that January -- the first of the ""Arab Spring"" revolutions still roiling the Middle East. Capt. Joe Morrow, the prosecutor, said Manning's arrogance meant that he ""felt he alone was knowledgeable and intelligent enough to determine what information was to be classified."" ""There may not be a soldier in the history of the Army who displayed such an extreme disregard"" for his mission, Morrow said Monday during final sentencing arguments. But Coombs said Manning was ""a young man capable of being redeemed"" and urged Lind to hand down ""a sentence that allows him to have a life."" He told reporters later that Manning's case should be seen as a watershed in the debate over secrecy that's now raging in the United States. ""The ultimate role of oversight in America has always belonged to the American people, and it's only to the extent that the American people can be informed as to these matters that oversight works at all,"" he said. ""There are too many things we don't know about our national security apparatus."" Manning apologizes, tells court he must pay price . CNN's Chris Lawrence contributed to this report.","NEW: Manning's leaks did ""vast damage"" and deserved more prison time, lawmaker says .

"Washington (CNN) -- In a graphic example of election-year politics at work, a defense bill that would repeal the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy got blocked Tuesday in the U.S. Senate by a Republican-led filibuster. The bill stalled on a 56-43 vote, four short of the 60 votes needed to overcome the Republican opposition. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, changed his vote to ""no"" as a tactical move, allowing him to bring the measure up later. Reid and other Democrats accused Republicans of stalling the National Defense Authorization Act, which traditionally passes with bipartisan support, to undermine the ""don't ask, don't tell"" repeal and an immigration provision offering a path to citizenship for students and soldiers who are children of illegal immigrants. Republicans countered that Democrats were trying to use defense policy act that authorizes $725 billion in military spending to force through provisions popular with their political base ahead of the November 2 congressional elections. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs expressed disappointment at the vote but said ""we'll keep trying"" to get Congress to approve the repeal of the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy barring openly gay and lesbian soldiers from the military. A federal judge recently ruled that the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy was unconstitutional, and the uncertainty of congressional action after Tuesday's vote further complicated the issue . What's your take on ""don't ask, don't tell""? The Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights advocacy group, said in response to the vote that the Justice Department should let the court ruling stand instead of filing an appeal. ""We still have a fighting chance to repeal DADT through congressional action, but in the meantime, the best interests of our men and women in uniform -- as well as the country -- are served by doing everything we can do to get rid of this discriminatory law,"" said Joe Solmonese, the group's president. Debate on the defense bill was rancorous in the run-up to the vote. Republicans accused Reid of trying to prevent them from proposing amendments to the bill and criticized his plan to tack on the immigration provision, known as the DREAM Act. ""I've never seen such a cynical use of the needs of the men and women of the military,"" said GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the top Republican on the Armed Services Committee, calling the expanded bill ""a cynical act for political reasons as the election nears to try to salvage what appears to be a losing campaign."" Reid countered that the Republican opposition was a blow to gay and lesbian Americans, as well as those born to illegal immigrants, who want to serve their country. ""The Defense Department¹s strategic plan explicitly states that passage of the DREAM Act is critical to helping the military shape and maintain a mission-ready all-volunteer force,"" Reid said in a statement. McCain and other Republicans ""should know better than anyone that patriots who step up to serve our grateful nation should be offered a path to citizenship, and that anyone who volunteers to serve should be welcomed regardless of their sexual orientation,"" Reid's statement said. Republican opponents included some GOP senators who favor lifting the Pentagon's requirement that gays and lesbians keep their sexuality a secret. However, they expressed concern that Democratic leaders could limit GOP amendments to the broader National Defense Authorization Act that includes the ""don't ask, don't tell"" provision. Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the chamber's top Republican, proposed an agreement for the chamber to consider 20 amendments on a rotating basis, but none could include adding the DREAM Act to the bill. Reid rejected the proposal, saying such an agreement was too great a departure from how the Senate normally conducted its business. Another of the chamber's Democratic leaders, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, said McConnell's proposal was intended to ""stop the DREAM Act."" With 59 seats in the chamber, Senate Democrats and their allies needed at least one Republican vote to reach the 60 needed to overcome a GOP filibuster. However, none of the moderate Republicans who in the past have voted with Democrats crossed the aisle this time. ""I find myself on the horns of a dilemma,"" Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said before the vote. Collins explained that she supported repeal of the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy but ""cannot vote to proceed to this bill under a situation that is going to shut down debate and preclude Republican amendments."" She called for an agreement that guarantees ""full and open debate,"" adding: ""Now is not the time to play politics simply because an election is looming in a few weeks."" On Monday, pop star Lady Gaga held a rally to call on both Collins and fellow Maine Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe to join Democrats in overcoming the expected GOP filibuster attempt. Both Snowe and Collins oppose the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy, and Collins was the sole Republican vote in the Senate Armed Services Committee in support of getting rid of it. However, both joined the GOP filibuster after Reid refused to change his approach. Reid had said he wanted the Senate to take up the bill now, but no final vote would take place until after the November 2 elections. He rejected the GOP calls for an agreement on how the amendment process would proceed, citing what he called a pattern of Republicans obstructing debate on important policies. The legislation, which is a broad defense policy bill, would rescind ""don't ask, don't tell"" after the Pentagon completes a review of the repeal's impact on the military. The review is due in December and would serve as the basis for certification by the president, defense secretary and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that the military could handle repealing the policy. On Tuesday, the general nominated to head the Marine Corps told a Senate committee that he believes responses from Marines on repealing the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy have been mostly negative so far. Gen. James Amos said he had heard that at Marine bases and in Marines' responses to an online survey, the feeling ""is predominantly negative."" He added, however, ""I don't know that as a fact."" In written answers to the Senate Armed Services Committee, Amos said he opposes repeal of the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy now because it could disrupt cohesion due to ""significant change during a period of extended combat operations."" At the same time, Amos made clear that he would oversee a repeal if ordered to do so. ""The Marine Corps is probably one of the most faithful services you have in our country,"" Amos said. ""And if the law is changed by Congress and signed by the president of the United States, the Marine Corps will get in step and do it smartly."" Many Republicans complain that Congress should not step in until after that military review is completed. McCain, the top Republican on the Armed Services Committee, said that approving a repeal provision before finishing the review process would amount to an insult to military personnel. ""The most fundamental thing we could do to honor the sacrifice of our troops is to take the time to hear their views,"" McCain said Tuesday. McCain also cited statements by the heads of the four military branches opposing congressional action on the issue before the review process is completed. Democrats noted that Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen, the Joint Chiefs chairman, have said publicly that they support repealing ""don't ask, don't tell."" The military has working groups looking at how to implement the change if ordered. The groups are looking at issues such as housing to entitlements and even personal displays of affection.

"Kano, Nigeria (CNN) -- The fight against militant Islamists in Nigeria led to dozens of deaths, mostly of civilians, in three villages this weekend. A military plane trying to bomb camps of the Boko Haram extremist group in the Sambisa Forest on Friday night ""mistook the village (Daglun) for a Boko Haram camp,"" said Ali Ndume, a senator representing the region. The inaccurate air raid was part of ""an ongoing offensive"" against the insurgents, Ndume said. Ndume said the four bombs dropped by the government aircraft killed five people and wounded several others. But Daglun residents, some of whom were forced to flee into the bush from burning homes, said the bombardment caused many more casualties. ""The village was asleep when I heard an aircraft hovering, and within a short interval, aerial bombardment started,"" a villager said, adding he was one of 25 wounded. ""The bombs torched homes and killed 20 people, most of them elderly people who could not run fast enough to escape the bombing."" The villager refused to give his name, fearing retaliation. A nurse at Mubi General Hospital, 45 kilometers (30 miles) away, confirmed that 25 people were admitted with ""mostly severe burns and ruptured tissues."" CNN was unable to confirm the number of causalities. In a statement Sunday, the Nigerian military dismissed the allegation that civilians were mistakenly killed in air operations, ""as the claim could not be confirmed after the mopping up aspect of the operation. ""The reports are believed to be part of the design by those bent on discrediting the counter terrorists mission,"" it said. Less than 24 hours after that incident, a flurry of violence in northeastern Nigeria, blamed on Boko Haram, left more than three dozen people dead and may have taken many more lives. Dozens of attackers in military uniforms stormed the village of Mainok on Saturday evening, riding four-wheelers and motorcycles, as residents were preparing for evening prayers. ""They came in around 7 p.m. and opened fire indiscriminately with RPGs (rocket propelled grenades), explosives and AK-47 rifles,"" said Mainok resident Yahaya Umar. ""They killed 39 people who were buried this morning and destroyed the whole town."" Boko Haram has attacked Mainok several times over the past two years, including a raid in July that killed 25 people there. Boko Haram is an Islamist militant group that has waged a campaign of violence in northeastern Nigeria, trying to impose its strict version of Sharia, or Islamic law. In its statement, the military said that troops and terrorists clashed around Mainok, resulting in an unspecified number of deaths on each side. The soldiers were in pursuit of people who carried out an attack in Buni Yadi last week, the military said. Police authorities were not available for comment on the attack in Mainok, which came soon after two explosions in Maiduguri, 50 kilometers away. ""We were just lamenting the twin blasts in Maiduguri at the soccer viewing center when the Boko Haram gunmen arrived and started firing volleys of RPGs and guns,"" Abdullahi Gana said. The Mainok resident added that some of the victims were burnt in their homes while others were shot as they tried to flee. The Maiduguri blasts happened about two minutes apart, as a crowd watched soccer on television there as well, said Maiduguri resident Goni Kakani. ""It is difficult to say how many people died in the blasts, but you are talking of dozens of dead people,"" said resident Babagoni Hassan.

Let's admit it: We all need to feel special sometimes. Well, if you're a firefighter, scientist or teacher, you should. After all, a new Harris poll indicates that plenty of Americans already think you are. Firefighters have one of the most prestigious jobs, according to a new Harris poll. U.S. adults, according to a recent survey by Harris Interactive, see firefighters, scientists and teachers as the most prestigious occupations while bankers, actors and real estate agents are the least prestigious occupations. The 2007 ""Most Prestigious Occupations"" poll measured the public perceptions of 23 professions. Participants were asked to rank these professions as having ""very great prestige,"" ""considerable prestige,"" ""some prestige,"" or ""hardly any prestige at all."" They could also opt not to rank them or say they weren't sure. Sixty-one percent of adults consider firefighters to have ""very great prestige,"" making this occupation the most prestigious on the list. Five other occupations were ranked as having ""very great prestige"" by over 50 percent of the adults surveyed: Scientists and teachers are considered very prestigious by 54 percent of adults, followed by doctors and military officers, who earn the prestige of 52 percent of Americans, and nurses, whom half of all adults consider very prestigious. Among the least prestigious occupations are real estate brokers, actors and bankers. Only 5 percent of survey participants ranked real estate brokers as very prestigious; 9 percent gave actors this label, followed by 10 percent for bankers. Accountants, entertainers, stockbrokers, union leaders, journalists, business executives and athletes all also ranked low on the list: Less than 20 percent of adults consider any of the aforementioned occupations to have ""very great prestige."" Consequently, five occupations are perceived to have ""hardly any prestige at all"" by at least a quarter of adults: stockbrokers (25 percent), union leaders (30 percent), entertainers (31 percent), real estate brokers (34 percent) and actors (38 percent). Harris Interactive started conducting its ""Most Prestigious Careers"" survey in 1977 and included only 11 professions. The most significant change since the survey's inception is that, with the exception of teachers and clergy, the perceived prestige of every one of the original 11 occupations has actually decreased over the years. The most drastic drop occurred among scientists, lawyers and athletes, whose prestige dropped by 12 points, 14 points and 10 points, respectively. Clergy members are considered prestigious by a percentage point more of the population than they were 30 years ago, while teachers' perceived prestige increased by 25 percent. Understandably, the year-to-year changes are less drastic. Scientists' perceived prestige hasn't changed in the last year, and despite a significant jump from 1977, teachers' perceived prestige has increased by only two percentage points. Bankers and athletes showed the most drastic drop in prestige: Both are down seven points from last year. The profession that saw the biggest increase in prestige from 2006 was that of farmers, who rose five points. While the survey measures the degree to which certain occupations are considered prestigious, it offers no indication as to why people consider certain occupations more prestigious than others.

"(CNN)  -- Soupy Sales, a comedian from the golden era of television, died Thursday. He was 83. Soupy Sales entertained generations of Americans with his off-the-cuff, wacky antics. He was 83. The funny man seen many times on popular game shows died at a New York hospice, said Paul Dver, Sales' longtime friend and manager. ""We have lost a comedy American icon,"" Dver said. ""I feel the personal loss, and I also feel the magic that he had around him being gone. That's a much more severe loss than a loss of a friend."" Sales was known for his long-running children's show ""Lunch With Soupy Sales,"" which started in 1953 and began his trademark slapstick pie-throwing antics. The comedy show featured skits that culminated in Sales getting walloped with pies in the face. What are your memories of Sales? ""Soupy was the last of the great TV comics when you talk about Ernie Kovacs, Red Skelton, right down to Howdy Doody,"" Dver said. ""But it was bigger than that, because he used a children's format aimed at the kids and then he would forget he was doing a kids' show and do a wild, unrehearsed, wacky improv for a half-hour every day for 15 years."" He could also inflame the authorities. One New Year's Day, upset at being asked to work, he asked his youthful audience to send him those ""green pieces of paper"" from their parents' wallets. Though he didn't receive much -- he told The New York Times he received only a few dollars -- he was suspended for a week for the prank. Later in his career, he was a regular on TV game shows, such as ""Hollywood Squares,"" ""To Tell the Truth"" and ""What's My Line?"" Sales recently fell backstage at a local Emmy awards show in New York and developed serious ailments after that, Dver said.

"(CNN) -- Not since the Wright brothers flew the first powered aircraft near Kitty Hawk in 1903 has the competition been so intense. The technology that can give us the world's first affordable and easily pilotable flying car is almost here. Several start-ups are already moving their prototypes forward and the race is on. But just like the early days of flight, there are several schools of thought about which model will be the most efficient, workable and worthy of being the template for the future. No need for a runway . ""For me, it has to be vertical take-off and landing,"" said Daniel Lubrich, the managing director of Krossblade Aerospace Systems. ""I think this idea of an aircraft you can drive on the street but you still have to find an airport for is nice, but it doesn't really solve the problem."" His Arizona-based team has developed a concept for a hybrid five-seat transformer airplane called a SkyCruiser. Looking a bit like the lovechild of a futuristic light plane and the flying vehicle known as ""The Bat"" from the movie ""The Dark Knight Rises"", the SkyCruiser sports foldable wings and four foldable rotors with electric motors powered by a Wankel rotary engine generator. The quadcopter concept would allow the flying car to take off vertically from a traffic jam, for instance, without the need for a runway. Once airborne, it would switch to horizontal flight, using two 150 bhp electric motors in the tail to power it through the air at more than 300 mph. The designers claim it could fly from Los Angeles to San Francisco in little more than an hour -- faster than any other drivable aircraft currently in development. On the ground, its 31-foot (9.5 meter) wingspan can be stowed, its four rotors retracted and electric motors in the wheels can drive the vehicle along the road at 75 mph (112 kph). However, with a total length of 8.4 meters (27.5 feet), don't expect to park it on any city block with ease. Lubrich says he envisages the hybrid could fly almost three times faster than equivalent projects; a necessary advantage in his native Germany, where cars can already travel as fast as 85 mph on the country's autobahns, with some stretches even free of any speed limit. ""I think you need to fly significantly faster than that to really have an advantage,"" he told CNN. ""If you only fly at 110 mph, you're only going a little bit faster, you have to pay a lot more money in fuel and you still have to land at an airport. ""A flying car really needs to be optimized for flight -- if you have to drive a little bit it should only be a mile or two."" Currently its prototype, a model called the SkyProwler, has worked according to plan and the company says it's only a matter of time before it can be scaled up into five-seat, fully operational flying car. Ease of control . While quadcopter technology is not new, the fact that it is now computer driven has changed the aviation landscape. Lubrich explained that, unlike helicopters, quadcopters cannot change the pitch of their rotors to achieve maneuverability. Instead, the four rotors make adjustments by changing the speed at which they rotate. ""The drone revolution, with its multi-rotors, has changed everything,"" he said. ""The very first attempts to have vertical takeoff were not helicopters but quadcopters in the 1920s and even earlier. ""They had the problem that they didn't have computers for the flight control so the pilot had to constantly adjust for the minute differences in the composition of the rotors. They were impossible to fly. ""Now we have flight computers and they do everything wonderfully and automatically. Press up and they go up, press left and they go left -- you don't have to worry about calibrating and controlling it."" Flying in from the East . Another flying car pioneer is the Slovak company Aeromobil whose Aeromobil 3.0 flying car was unveiled in Vienna last month. Dubbed the Flying Roadster, the sporty working prototype looks like a finished production model and has a range of 430 miles (700 kilometers) and a top air speed of 124 mph (200kph). Co-founder of the company Juraj Vaculik told CNN the quest to find a workable solution to the flying car may be in its final stages. ""This race is actually almost 100 years old,"" Vaculik said. ""I love the pioneering history of aviation and the first attempt to build a flying car was in 1917 -- since then there have been plenty of others."" ""The technology now is so accessible and at such a high level. Carbon fiber materials, high-tech technologies; 10 years ago these things were just so expensive and out of reach for small teams."" ""The quality of the autopilot systems that we were able to install in our prototype, for instance, even five years ago was just an impossible dream,"" he said. While the Aeromobil needs some aviation infrastructure to operate, its makers say that it has proprietary systems which make it flexible. With variable angle of attack wings, the flying car has increased lift for takeoff and greater drag for landing. ""Europe and the United States have plenty of small airfields and sports airfields, but at the same time with this prototype you don't need that. All we need is a 250-meter grass strip for take off and just 50 meters for landing."" Rules and regulations . As with most new systems, both start-ups say the biggest hurdles are likely to be regulatory and political. In this respect, Aeromobil says the MyCopter project -- which is investigating the regulatory and logistical problems with mass air traffic -- has been invaluable for the nascent flying car industry. ""It's similar a situation with many innovations,"" he said. ""When mobile phones came in they created a completely different environment that needed new regulations and new ways of thinking."" ""What the guys in MyCopter are doing is creating the right set up for how air traffic systems could be organized."" While there's some rivalry between the start-ups (Vaculik remains skeptical of fuel-heavy vertical take off models which he says need too much power to lift the dead weight of the vehicle), he says it's mostly collaboration. ""We are just so happy that we are not the only ones doing this,"" he said. ""If we were, maybe people would think we were just crazy.""","The technology to give us the world's first affordable and easily pilotable flying car is almost here .

"(Wired) -- Film is an exceedingly delicate material. It's highly flammable, can't always go through TSA checkpoints, and, as it turns out, can be easily destroyed by fungus. A few years ago South Korean artist Seung-Hwan Oh read a BBC article about this fungus problem affecting film archives. He realized they were right: ""I noticed that mold on badly stored film can eat away and destroy its contents,"" he says. ""And then I realized that I may deliver the idea of impermanence of matter applying this natural disaster into my work."" It's a heady notion, but when Oh talks about 'impermanence' he's talking about the ""idea that all the matter, including all the life forms, collapse in the spatial-temporal dimension we belong to."" It's his inspiration in this series, and it's based on the second law of thermodynamics, which states that as usable energy in the universe gets used—to power life, and grow organisms—unusable energy increases and creates a state of growing randomness and chaos. Put differently, Oh started letting mold grow on his film. Rather than worrying about fungus, he embraced it. To do that Oh had to set up a micro-fungus farm in his studio. Film gets stashed away in a warm, wet environment where fungus can grow. Oh will sometimes take mold that grows naturally on bread and rice and paste it into the prints, but that's about as much control as he can exercise over the outcome. For such a gnarly material, the results often look like the cosmos, splashed across a photograph. At times the prints are haunting for their ability to distort a portrait into a ghostly scene—as if the subjects are vampires that can't be caught on camera. But it's also a painstaking medium to work in: ""To put thing in perspective, only one out of 500 frames of medium format color reversal film comes out properly and I only have 15 of them so far since I started the project in 2010.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Cast members of the hit television show ""Happy Days,"" who are suing CBS, accused the company of ""despicable conduct"" for not paying them for merchandising revenues. The comment was made in court papers filed by the actors' attorney in response to a claim by CBS that the case had no merit. ""In this lawsuit, plaintiffs seek their share of the money collected by defendants as a result of the use of the actors' names and likenesses in connection with merchandising,"" the document, filed by attorney Jon Pfeiffer in Los Angeles Superior Court, said. ""Plaintiffs also want the jury to punish defendants for their despicable conduct."" Four members of the cast -- Marion Ross, Don Most, Anson Williams and Erin Moran -- along with the widow of Tom Bosley, sued CBS in April, claiming they have not been paid what they're owed for the worldwide sale of ""Happy Days"" merchandise. ""Happy Days"" was originally on the air from 1974 to 1984. Bosley died in October. Williams: ""Unfortunately, now 'Happy Days' also represents the worst of America."" Under their contracts, the actors were supposed to receive 5% of net proceeds, or 2½% if their images were used in a group. In interviews with CNN earlier this year, the four cast members said they decided to move forward after discovering ""Happy Days"" slot machines were popping up in casinos around the country in 2008. ""This is one of the most heavily merchandised shows ever,"" Most said. ""People loved 'Happy Days,' and it's been on everything from bedsheets to lunch boxes."" The suit asks for $10 million in damages. CNN Money: 'Happy Days' actors claim fraud, money owed for merchandising . The latest court filing follows a response by CBS to the suit last month. The company, which owns the show, said the actors are ""attempting to generate a lucrative litigation windfall by riddling their complaint with unsupported and overreaching causes of action"" for fraud and breach of good faith. CBS said this was ""all done in a transparent attempt to introduce the specter of punitive damages"" in the case. CBS called the case ""a garden-variety breach of contract action, nothing more."" But the actors fired back, saying ""although defendants routinely rebrand their corporate images, they should not be permitted to rebrand the truth."" They pointed out that they have not ""sought damages for speculative profits they had hoped to make on a risky business deal"" or for a ""windfall of money from conduct that did not harm them."" The company disputed that it ""concealed"" its obligation to pay merchandising revenues. Instead, it said the actors ""were simply ignorant of, or slept upon their own rights. That cannot serve as a basis for a fraud claim."" But, in the latest court filing, the actors said CBS ""should not be rewarded for concealing the money they made and not paying the actors."" ""It would place a tremendous burden on studios and production companies if every actor in the entertainment industry were required to call each company they ever worked for to inquire whether merchandising had occurred, and if so, whether any money is due,"" the court filing said. ""In order to remove that burden and standardize the process, the customary practice in the entertainment industry is to provide periodic statements to actors when money has been generated in connection with merchandise."" In 2002 and 2003, Moran contacted CBS about merchandising revenues but was told nothing was owed, the filing states. Since the lawsuit was filed, CBS has sent checks totaling $43,403 in merchandising proceeds to the four actors and Bosley's widow, Patricia. Pfeiffer told CNN he was holding onto the checks because CBS could argue the case had been settled if they were cashed. In a statement issued before the lawsuit was filed, CBS said it agreed that the actors ""are owed royalties from the merchandising of 'Happy Days' and have, in fact, been working with their representatives for some time to see that they are paid what they are due."" The company did not immediately respond to a CNN request for further comment about the court filing. The actors said CBS claimed it did not pay them for the ""Happy Days"" slot machine proceeds due ""to oversight."" However, the actors point out that Henry Winkler, who played The Fonz on the show, was paid for the use of his image on the slots. Neither Winkler nor Ron Howard, who played Richie Cunningham on the show, are part of the lawsuit. In addition, from 2008 to January 2011, CBS issued news releases announcing licensing agreements with 14 companies that include gift items, clothing, glassware and bar accessories, the court filing said. But in revenue statements sent to Pfeiffer after the lawsuit was filed, CBS did not include any revenue from four of those companies. Williams told CNN this week that the case is ""like 'Happy Days' versus Goliath. Here's one show and we're putting one of the biggest corporations in the world on the line to do the right thing. I'm hoping this case gives visibility to not only help us, but to help thousands of other individuals in the entertainment business.""","""Happy Days"" actors suing CBS over merchandising revenues .

"(CNN) -- The video shows the beginning of what was hoped would be a perfect plane ride, with the pilot of a 1940s-era Stinson and his three passengers smiling as the plane rumbles down a dirt runway in rural Idaho. But soon after take-off, the plane went down in a nearby forest, with the camera still rolling. Everyone on the plane survived to tell -- and show -- their harrowing tale. The four-seater had just taken off from an airport in Stanley, Idaho, June 30. The video, which was shot through the cockpit window, shows the runway disappearing beneath the plane and the sun glinting off the glass as the aircraft gained altitude to clear some nearby trees. The plane only ascended to about 60 or 70 feet, then dipped, hit the trees, and tumbled from the air. In a telephone interview with the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the incident, one of the passengers said the plane started losing altitude and experienced a downdraft right before it clipped the trees. According to The Idaho Statesman, the passengers -- who were on their way to a hiking trip -- remembered hearing the ""thud of treetops"" as the plane made its unexpected and scary descent. Tol Gropp, whose father, Les Gropp, was piloting, remembers losing consciousness when the plane hit the trees. The next thing he remembers is hanging upside down, according to The Statesman. The NTSB reported Les Gropp sustained serious injuries in the accident and his son told the newspaper he had a broken jaw, but has otherwise recovered. The Gropps are a religious family and credit their faith with helping them escape death. ""We are a pretty religious family and so are my friends. Some people will mark this off as my imagination... but we feel strongly that due to those blessings that help arrived so quickly in such mass numbers,"" Tol Gropp told The Idaho Statesman's Rachel Roberts. The NTSB has taken the plane to a secured storage facility for further examination.","The aircraft only rose about 70 feet before it clipped some trees .

"(CNN) -- Sandbag walls were beginning to rise Tuesday across parts of the Midwest against what the National Weather Service warned could be record flooding in the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys over the next week. Widespread major flooding is expected in parts of southern Missouri, southern Illinois, Indiana, western Kentucky, northern Arkansas and parts of Oklahoma, said Noreen Schwein, deputy for hydrologic services at the National Weather Service's central region headquarters in Kansas City, Missouri. Already, governors in Missouri, Illinois and Kentucky have declared emergencies, as have local officials in several counties. National Guard troops are on the job in Missouri and Indiana shoring up levees and stacking sandbags. Indiana also sent 80 prison inmates to the southwestern part of the state, where record flooding was already reported in Gibson County. Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn sent 125 members of the Guard to Marion to assist the response in the southern part of the state. Calls for volunteers to help with sandbagging efforts were going out across the region. Clifton Gentry of Jackson, Missouri, was planning to head to the small community of Dutchtown, Missouri, with his church group Tuesday night to help residents there fill and stack sandbags. ""There's a gas station and probably two, three dozen homes that will be under water tomorrow if something doesn't change,"" Gentry said. ""It's basically just the simple fact that we're told to help those in need, and if I was in that kind of situation I would hope someone would help me."" A levee in Poplar Bluff, Missouri, failed on Tuesday, city and county officials said, sending water flooding into a rural but populated area of Butler County, causing the evacuation of more than 6,000 people. People in the area were asked to leave ""as soon as possible,"" Butler County Sheriff's Detective Scott Phelps said. A levee protecting Bell City, Missouri, also failed, said Dale Moreland, public information officer for the Stoddard County Emergency Management Agency. Bell City schools let out early Tuesday because buses will likely not be able to navigate flooded roads later in the day, Moreland said. Up to 1,200 people south and east of Bell City faced possible evacuation later Tuesday. The breach was 95 feet wide and 6 to 8 feet deep. About 25 to 30 residences in in the county were affected by the water and a dozen people have been rescued since Monday, according to Moreland. A levee also failed in nearby Scott County, Moreland said. Missouri's attorney general turned to a federal court Tuesday to stop a federal plan to blow a levee to ease pressure on the flood-engorged Mississippi River. James Pogue, chief spokesman in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Memphis office, said the Birds Point-New Madrid Floodway is a ""safety valve"" in the current crisis affecting several states along the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. In Paducah, Kentucky, where forecasters are predicting the Ohio River will rise more than it has in at least 61 years, garbage collection was temporarily suspended because every available worker was installing floodgates before the Ohio River rises too high to contain. ""We are putting all our resources on this catastrophe,"" City Engineer Rick Murphy said. Crews were also working to build a steel barrier and extend a levee around the city's convention center, which was at risk of being flooded. The National Weather Service forecast the Ohio River at Paducah to rise to 55 feet by May 3, 16 feet above flood stage and two feet above the high water mark in 1950. Paducah resident Jennie Bell, a CNN iReporter, said heavy rains and river water are already covering some streets, including the road she normally uses to drive her daughter to school. ""It's getting hard to get around,"" she said. In Clark County, Indiana, flooding has forced some people from their homes in the city of Utica and other nearby communities. Some residents have been evacuated. Others are waiting to see what happens, said Phyllis Wilkins, executive director of the Clark County chapter of the American Red Cross. ""There's a lot of U-Haul trailers sitting in driveways ready to go, people sitting on porches watching the waters rise,"" she said. ""Of course, these are people who've lived on the river for a long time so they're used to that routine."" Record or near-record floods are expected from Smithland, Kentucky, to Cairo, Illinois, on the Ohio River and then south to New Madrid, Missouri, downstream from the juncture of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, Schwein said. If predictions are correct, the flooding could surpass records set in a mighty flood that inundated the region in 1937. The Weather Service said the Ohio River at Cairo would crest at 61 feet on May 3, 21 feet above flood stage and 18 inches higher than the 1937 mark. The Mississippi River is forecast to top flood stage as far south as Reserve, Louisiana, according to the agency. The National Weather Service said snow melt from the upper Midwest and rapid runoff from as much as a foot of rain in Mississippi and Ohio river valley states is contributing to the flooding. Three to 5 inches of additional rain expected in the next two days is built into the flooding forecast, Schwein said. Another bulge of water from melting snow is working its way down the Mississippi River now, Schwein said. The bulge, currently in Iowa, will extend the flooding but is not expected to increase crest levels, she said. Springdale, Arkansas, received 17 inches of rain between Friday and midmorning Tuesday. Poplar Bluff, Missouri, saw just shy of 13 inches. Arkansas' Fayetteville and Eureka Springs received more than 12 inches. The total for Carbondale, Illinois, was 8.64 inches and Paducah, Kentucky, was at 8.24 inches.

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Sniffer dogs in South Africa are being trained to help the fight against poachers of endangered species in a new way. Dogs have long been used to help police find contraband substances, including ivory and rhino horn. However, there are times when it is not practical to use dogs on the ground, as the tarmac at border posts gets too hot for them during the day, or if there could be a danger to the animal. Now researchers at the South African company Mechem are adapting their Explosive and Drug Detection System to the fight against poachers. The technology involves using a vacuum device to suction air from a suspect area. The filter in the vacuum is then given to the dogs to smell, disguised among blank control filters, and the dog's nose does the rest. Mechem says this technology helps to get round all the problems that sniffer dogs traditionally face by ""taking the odor to the dog rather than taking the dog to the odor."" Mechem's Explosive and Drug Detection System was first developed in the 1980s to detect landmines, weapons, ammunition and drugs. It has now been improved and adapted to detect illegal substances taken from protected species. Dogs trained at Mechem are now helping the police where conventional canine units are struggling. Inspector T.C.Oosthuizen, of the South African Police Service, said: ""When we work at Komatipoort for instance, the tarmac is so hot, it starts melting so you can't get a dog to work from 12 o'clock in the afternoon. ""And the smugglers, they know about it, so then they know you can't bring a dog to the border posts because the dog of course will burn. ""With this machine you take the samples, and give it to the dog in a controlled environment, an air-conditioned facility. It's cool for the dog so the dog can work longer and more."" The stakes are high. Poachers are smuggling rhino horn to the lucrative Asian market where it's thought to have medicinal qualities and can fetch about $7,500 a kilo. Conservation groups estimate that there are now only 18,000 rhinos in Africa today, down from 65,000 in the late 1970s. Dr Hannes Slabbert, Mechem's animal behaviorist and a former police officer, said: ""We can search hundreds of cars and the dog will detect the odor that he was trained on. ""So if the dog is trained on your protected species, or your narcotics, or your explosive detections, when your dog indicates we will know that you would then search for the specific contraband."" Slabbart said the dog would detect the substance, as long as it had been collected correctly in the vacuum sampler. Mechem is working with the South African police to research the feasibility of rolling the system out to all their canine units. Paul Bester, Colonel in the South African Police Service, said: ""I'm very excited because it seems that we have a concept there that can work through all our points of entry in South Africa. It can assist all the dog handlers; make their task a little bit easier for them as well.""","Technology helps dogs sniff out ivory and rhino horn .

"(CNN) -- The cost of college tuition will continue to rise as long as federal student aid programs continue to increase with little or no accountability. That was the hypothesis (now known in education circles as the Bennett Hypothesis) of a column I wrote for The New York Times in 1987, in response to tuition hikes at many of the nation's colleges and universities. I had noticed an interesting phenomenon: Increases in federal financial aid were not improving college affordability. Each year, federal financial aid outlays would increase, but college tuitions would continue to rise above and beyond the rate of inflation. Much like the effects of subsidies on health care and the housing market, increasing student aid was insulating colleges from having to make market-driven cost-cutting measures, like improving productivity or efficiency. It appears that this may still be true today. Last month, Andrew Gillen at the Center for College Affordability and Productivity authored a new paper introducing the ""Bennett Hypothesis 2.0,"" an updated version of my original argument. Under the current financial aid system, he concluded, ""As higher financial aid pushes costs higher, it inevitably puts upward pressure on tuition. Higher tuition, of course, reduces college affordability, leading to calls for more financial aid, setting the vicious cycle in motion all over again."" In 1987, I reached my hypothesis by examining the basic relationship between federal financial aid and tuition. Let's compare the numbers today. In 2010, the Department of Education distributed $133 billion in student aid. In 2011, it was nearly $157 billion, a 17% increase. Pell Grants increased from $29 billion in 2010 to $36 billion in 2011, a 24% increase. At the same time, in 2011, costs at the average public university rose 5.4% for in-state students, or about $1,100. Average tuition at public universities rose 8.3%. The increases have greatly outpaced the rate of inflation, which was 3% in 2011. While increased federal aid does not cause college price inflation, it can be a considerable factor. Many other elements influence tuition prices, such as the rise of alumni donations, the expansions of institutional services and the ever-increasing demand for higher education. Families will go to incredible, and often insane, lengths to get their son or daughter into college, and these institutions know that. Nevertheless, the federal mechanism intended to make college more affordable seems to be having little or no effect. Furthermore, taxpayers are getting fewer returns for their money. In 2009, the six-year graduation rate of bachelor's students was 56% in the United States. In 1997, it was 52%. During that time period, student aid skyrocketed. According to the College Board, ""Total student aid increased by about 84% in inflation-adjusted dollars over the decade from 1997-98 to 2007-08."" Taxpayers are subsidizing higher education at greater and greater costs while institutional performance has not kept up. This gap between enrollment and graduation costs the U.S. economy millions of dollars in potential earnings each year and expands the growing student loan bubble. Weighed down by rising tuition costs, students borrow more money each year to pay for college. The more they borrow, the more difficult it becomes for them to pay for college on their own or in a timely manner, and if they fail to graduate, they are left holding larger piles of debt. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, student loan indebtedness reached $867 billion last year. (By comparison, outstanding U.S. credit card debt was $704 billion.) And almost 15% of all borrowers have at least one past-due loan account. There are legitimate fears that this could be the next U.S. debt bomb. Why should taxpayers continue to increase funding for federal aid programs that do little to control soaring college costs and rein in student debt? Like the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, the middle class would be crushed by a mass student loan default. Our students and their families deserve better than this. As I said 25 years ago, ""Higher education is not underfunded. It is under-accountable."" Federal aid should be closely tied to academic performance, graduation rates and the ability of students to repay their loans in a responsible manner. During his State of the Union address this year, President Obama said, ""We can't just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition."" He added, ""So let me put colleges and universities on notice. If you can't stop tuition from going up, the funding you get from taxpayers will go down."" It's encouraging to see the president acknowledge what has long been the argument of conservative education reformers. It remains to be seen if his threat holds any weight and if he will act on it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William J. Bennett.","William Bennett: Increases in federal financial aid don't seem to improve college affordability .
Bennett: Taxpayers subsidize higher education, but institutions' performances haven't kept up .
He says student loan indebtedness could be the next U.S. debt bomb .

"(CNN) -- It was late afternoon in Kiev on July 17 when I spotted the tweet: A commercial airliner had been downed over eastern Ukraine. My team, more than 250 civilians from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, had been sent to Ukraine three months before to monitor and report on the security situation in the country and to facilitate dialogue. Now we were involved in something very different. As the minutes ticked by, we raced to verify claims about the plane. Soon it was confirmed: A Boeing 777 with 298 people aboard it had crashed. It was exactly 24 hours after Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 fell out of the heavens and into the farmlands of the Donetsk region when our team of two dozen monitors arrived on the scene. We knew we were close when we spotted from a distance the vertical tail, with the Malaysia Airlines logo still largely intact. It lay peacefully, seemingly untouched, in a wheat field. We were the first international organization on the ground, and with that came an intense, unprecedented media glare that would last for days. Some referred to us as ""the eyes and ears of the world"" -- and what we saw was horrifying. Our first observations were of a gruesome scene of smoldering rubble, bodies (some still strapped into their seats), personal belongings and a bewildered group of swaggering rebels, uniformed first responders and foreign journalists. There was no sign of perimeter security. Aside from the vertical tail, the aft section of the fuselage was among the largest, intact pieces of debris. On the opposite side of a farm road that bisected the main impact site were more terrible scenes: mangled corpses amid still-smoldering fuselage, duty free shopping bags and open suitcases. Farther along the hellish landscape was where the wings, fuel tanks, landing gear and main cabin crashed. The impact of the jet smashing into the ground caused a fireball in one field that brought temperatures as high as 1,600 degrees Celsius, according to some experts -- enough to melt the aluminum wings of the 17-year-old aircraft and incinerate everything in the immediate area. Incredibly, the small village of Hrabove, just a few meters away, remained relatively untouched. On Day One, we were only able to spend 75 minutes on the site. The heavily armed rebel who appeared to be in charge was largely uncooperative and clearly unhappy with our presence there. He was aggressive and appeared to be intoxicated. Journalists on the scene told us that they had been hastily corralled, apparently to create a semblance of order. There were many scenes that defied logic: an opened bag of duty free items with two plastic, un-pilfered bottles of whiskey, a MacBook Pro laptop, a Lonely Planet guidebook to Bali -- not a surprising find given that this ""backpacker route"" is heavily used by holidaymakers destined for Asia. A few days later we'd find several passports that had been taken away and then put back at the crash site, apparently by a guilt-ridden first responder. What also struck us was the randomness of how pieces of the plane fell upon this bucolic region of conflict-ridden eastern Ukraine: a toilet sink here, a business class seat a few meters away and next to it the horizontal stabilizers. We were shocked one day to chance upon an enormous piece of the main passenger cabin, hidden away in the woods. I counted 17 windows, some of them still intact. By far the most horrific scene was four days after the crash, when our team monitored the sealing up of train cars filled with the remains of the plane's passengers, at the railway station in Torez (which, ironically, was where four of our colleagues were kidnapped by an armed group at the end of May). The stench of death at the station was overwhelming. Yet knowing that these souls were finally on their way home, out of this chaotic scene to a place where they could be cared for with dignity, provided some sense of comfort. I noted how the local women from the railway station took great pains to meticulously seal the car doors -- perhaps feeling in some small way that they had aided the families of the victims. It was during these first crucial days that our team was able to facilitate access for four small groups of experts: a team of civil aviation experts from Kiev, a three-member team from Malaysia Airlines and that country's department of civil aviation, along with Dutch and Australian experts. I marveled particularly at the stoicism and composure of the Malaysian experts: These are men who live and breathe aviation, and they knew the aircraft intimately. The tragedy struck deeply for me as well. I had lived and worked for many years in Malaysia, have many friends there and am very familiar with the country and the airline. My roots are in Ukraine, and I've covered commercial aviation as a journalist and I've a well-known fondness for flying. At least at the end of every day, we were able to retreat to the relative comfort of our hotel in Donetsk city. But even there, the threat of violence was never far off. Late one night, standing on the hotel rooftop waiting to go live on TV with CNN's Erin Burnett, the sound of automatic gunfire sent me and the Turkish crew rushing for cover. I ended up speaking to Erin crouched down near a protective wall. On August 1, after almost a week-long pause due to security reasons, we were able to establish a new access route that paved the way for daily visits by a critical mass of Dutch and Australian experts to the MH17 crash site. To finally see dozens of trained sets of eyes combing over the site, starting with the chicken farm near Hrabove, brought us all a sense of accomplishment. As images of the uniformed experts surveying the fields, aided by sniffer dogs, were flashed around the word by the media and via social media, I thought to myself that this must have brought some sense of comfort to the families of the victims. And after days of waiting in Donetsk, I know that the Dutch and Australian experts -- despite the grim task ahead of looking for victims' remains and personal belongings, as well as the dangers of working a crime scene in the midst of an active conflict zone -- could not wait to get down to work. The sounds of shelling in the distance were a constant reminder of the threat. Little wonder that during an orientation session, one of the commanders instructed the experts to ""treat every day here as if it is your last day on site."" I am often asked how we coped with the enormity of all this, of the horrific scenes we witnessed. What powered us through this was knowing that we were providing families with crucial bits of information in those chaotic first days. As always, our hearts and prayers are with the victims' loved ones, and we hope that we have been able to provide them with some sense of comfort and closure to this horrific tragedy.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Thousands of people have converged in the center of London for the first major protest ahead of next week's G-20 summit. Up to 20,000 people are expected to join Saturday's protests in London. Despite fears of violence in coming days that have prompted a major security operation in the British capital, Saturday's demonstration has so far been peaceful. As many as 20,000 people were expected at the Put People First march, organized by trade unions but backed by some 120 other groups including environmentalists, church groups, and political campaigners. Authorities are bracing for possible violence as anti-capitalist and environmental protesters to converge on the Bank of England next Wednesday -- April 1 -- for a ""mass street party"" dubbed ""Financial Fools Day."" Protesters gathering on Saturday were calling for jobs, fair distribution of wealth, and a low-carbon future. They carried banners and posters reading ""Climate Emergency,"" ""Gaza: End the Blockade,"" ""Planet Before Profit,"" ""We Won't Pay for Their Crisis,"" and ""Jobs not Bombs."" Some groups turned out to march in bright-colored rain ponchos or hard hats. The day began with a church service in central London. The Salvation Army, which helped organize the service, said it was a ""perfect opportunity to ask the G-20 to consider the world's most vulnerable people."" Those at the service sang ""We are blessed to bless a world in pieces."" They asked for freedom from debt and justice to profit, the Salvation Army said. After gathering along the Thames River and marching along its banks, marchers moved past Trafalgar Square to Hyde Park for a mass rally in the afternoon. Speakers at the rally include trade union bosses, environmentalists, and global justice campaigners, along with musicians and a comedian, according to march organizers. Jake Corn, from Cambridge, told the UK's Press Association he was taking part to show support for a more sustainable future.

"(CNN) -- Former University of North Carolina head football coach Butch Davis believes he is being scapegoated by his former university as it deals with the largest academic fraud scandal in the history of college sports. Davis, in an interview with CNN on Tuesday, said, ""I can tell you with every fiber in me that I did not know about cheating."" His statements come after a caller identifying himself as Tydreke Powell, one of Davis' former players, told North Carolina radio station WJMH that ""everyone"" in the athletic department knew about so-called paper classes, and that Davis even told his players, ""If you all came here for an education, you should have gone to Harvard."" Powell played from 2008 to 2011, under Davis until 2010. Whether he was the person speaking to the radio station Monday could not be confirmed by CNN, and efforts by CNN to reach Powell were not successful. Davis, who was fired from UNC as the scandal began to unfold in early 2011, told CNN he read about what Powell purportedly said on the radio, but Davis said his own words were taken out of context. Davis, now an analyst with ESPN, said he made the Harvard remark to his players, but portrayed his remarks as being ""halfway joking, teasing, and half tongue-in-cheek."" He admitted the comment was a poor choice of words, ""but it was never intended to be anything other than, 'life is tough for student athletes,'"" adding that he told the players something similar to, ""Guys, I know how hard your day is ... your life is tougher than non-student-athletes. If you just wanted an education, solely, you should have gone to Harvard."" Former athlete sues UNC over academic scandal . Last month, former federal prosecutor Ken Wainstein released a scathing report, the product of an eight-month investigation into fake classes at UNC, and found that about 30 administrators at the university knew that athletes who were failing or were at risk of failing were shuffled into classes where a single paper was required and where plagiarism was overlooked. Wainstein portrayed rampant and systematic cheating, spanning 18 years and affecting 3,100 students. About half were athletes. His report came five years after the scandal was first uncovered, and follows several other internal investigations. But it was by far the most comprehensive to date, for the first time implicating staff in the scheme. Davis said he feels his interview with Wainstein was mischaracterized in the summary. ""I do feel like there have been things that it looked like it would be the easy way -- blame it on the football program and maybe it will all go away,"" Davis said. Wainstein's report found that when an athlete was on the brink of eligibility, advisers in football and basketball and other sports would often enroll the athlete in a paper class, sometimes suggesting the grade they needed to stay afloat academically. This, in part, was done because many athletes at UNC were admitted to the university even though they were unprepared. Wainstein's report says that Davis admitted to knowing about easy classes in the African-American (AFAM) Studies department, and knew that these classes were keeping athletes eligible. It cites a 2009 PowerPoint presentation in which Davis was told that many of his players were in these classes and that they ""didn't go to class... didn't take notes... didn't have to meet with professors... [and] didn't have to pay attention or necessarily engage with the material."" But Davis said that episode, too, was mischaracterized. Davis said he was under the impression the situations being discussed had only happened in the past, and he insisted that coaches were not involved in the academics of student-athletes. ""The coaches and athletic department has no control over degrees they choose, the course -- that had nothing to do with me,"" Davis told CNN. ""Every year they would say, 'When do you want to have practice, and we'll work around it.' I may have told Wainstein that those classes helped kids stay eligible, but I didn't know it was crooked until after I left the program."" Davis said he believed that the independent studies in the AFAM department were the same as independent studies courses in any other college in the school. Davis said -- and this is backed up by Wainstein's report -- that he had no idea that plagiarism was accepted, or that the papers weren't graded by the professor, Julius Nyang'oro, but by his clerical assistant Debbie Crowder. ""How would I, as a football coach, know that a secretary is grading the papers?"" Davis said. Wainstein acknowledged that both Davis and basketball coach Roy Williams took steps to improve the academics of their athletes while coaching at UNC. Davis reduced the number of athletes admitted who were underprepared. And Williams took steps to reduce clustering, Wainstein said. Report finds 18 years of academic fraud at UNC . According to Wainstein's report, the paper classes, which began in 1993, were Crowder's idea. Wainstein reviewed transcripts and found that they were most prevalent between 1999 and 2009. Davis and Williams both coached during those years, and Williams won two national championships in basketball during that time. Nyang'oro, who resigned after the scandal emerged, was charged with fraud in connection with the case, but the charge was dropped after he agreed to cooperate with the criminal investigation. No charges were filed against Crowder, who retired in 2009. Neither Crowder nor Nyang'oro has spoken publicly about the scandal, and both declined requests to speak to CNN. Davis said he doesn't get enough credit for raising his players' grade-point averages and graduation rates during that time period, although critics say paper classes were part of the reason those GPAs rose. One adviser even characterized them in the Wainstein report as ""GPA boosters."" But Davis said Wainstein's team also neglected to interview some of his assistants who would have backed up his story. ""These are things that are disturbing,"" he said. The Wainstein report says all assistant coaches were given the opportunity to talk, but some did not respond. Davis said he feels the attention should be focused now on the advisers who steered athletes to the sham classes, not on the coaches. ""All academics at UNC fell outside the realm of the athletic department, which is one of the things that I liked,"" he said. ""All of the tutoring ... was handled at the (university's) College of Arts and Sciences. This should be about the College of Arts and Sciences, and leave the coaches out of it because we didn't have anything to do with it."" The university issued a statement in response to CNN's request for comment: ""We appreciate Butch Davis' cooperation with the independent investigation conducted by Kenneth Wainstein. Mr. Davis was one of 126 individuals interviewed about their knowledge of or role in the irregular classes. We believe that this was the most thorough and complete investigation possible. Mr. Davis is entitled to his opinions about the final content of Mr. Wainstein's report."" Wainstein's report found that Davis' predecessor, head coach John Bunting, admitted to some knowledge of the paper class scheme. But the report cleared Williams, the current basketball coach. Former interim head football coach Everett Withers refused to cooperate with the Wainstein investigation, as did football director Cynthia Reynolds. Withers is now at James Madison University, and Reynolds is at Cornell University.","Butch Davis was fired as head football coach at UNC as academic scandal unfolded .

"(CNN) -- As a father of three, I felt Tricia Lammers' pain as she spoke about her son Blaec. He is 22 years old and six feet tall, with a goatee. But like most mothers, she still sees her son as a little boy. When I visited her at her home in Bolivar, Missouri, she was delighted to show off her scrapbooks filled with pictures from his childhood. She told me Blaec loved anything where he could use his hands. He played football, baseball and basketball and did karate. In ninth grade, she told me with pride, he aced his classes one term, and made the dean's list. Every day when his father came home from work, Blaec was there, ready. The pair used to ride dirt bikes together. When the family had to sell the bikes to save some money, it crushed Blaec. He told me he would have done anything to spend a little more time with his father. In fact, when Blaec bought two guns a couple of years later, his plan was to give one to his father for Christmas. It would be something else they could do together, he thought. But things didn't work out that way. Blaec spent that Christmas in prison instead. His parents told police Blaec had purchased two assault rifles at Walmart. They warned authorities he had been hospitalized several times while struggling with mental illness. Tricia Lammers believes that was her son's only crime. He didn't shoot anyone or hurt anyone in any way. And yet he is serving two concurrent 15-year prison sentences, in lockdown for 23 hours a day. He was convicted of first-degree assault and armed criminal action. He will spend the prime of his life in prison. It's time to talk about mental health . Tricia and her husband, Bill, laid their lives bare in an unforgettable interview that left me stunned. They let me talk to Blaec's doctors to get a better understanding of Blaec's mindset and diagnoses. They also gave me permission to visit Blaec in the Jefferson City Correctional Center in Jefferson City, Missouri, the maximum security prison he now calls home, so I could ask all my questions and draw my own conclusions. Blaec's story is really about the bizarre convergence between our prison system and our mental health system. He was diagnosed with dyslexia as a kid and placed on the autism spectrum as a teenager. Around his junior year in high school, Blaec developed signs of a true personality disorder. He had trouble communicating with others, started to have trouble with his grades and developed a profound and painful loneliness. My breath stuck in my throat when he described a semester where he hid away in a school bathroom every day to eat his lunch alone because he was shy, didn't have any friends and didn't know how to make them. His parents took him to doctor after doctor, and within two years, he had nearly a dozen different psychiatric diagnoses and a handful of psychotropic medications to go along with them. Getting their son admitted and treated was the Lammers' goal, and given that Bill worked as the director of radiology at a local hospital, they thought it was an attainable one. It proved nearly impossible. The number of psychiatric beds has been on a steady decline over the last few decades, according to Treatment Advocacy Center. Back in 1960, there were 535,000 public psychiatric beds nationwide. When the Lammerses were trying to get their son help in 2010, there were 43,318 -- less than 10% compared with 50 years earlier. Sharing experiences with mental illness can help . The couple looked into private camps, but the nearly $100,000 price tag was not within their reach. ""The mental health system is not fractured -- it is totally broken,"" Bill Lammers told me. As we reported this story and talked to experts in psychiatry, criminal justice and law enforcement, the same questions came up again and again: Should people like Blaec Lammers be prisoners or patients? And how do you reasonably distinguish between the two? When Tricia pleaded with the judge in January, he told her 70% of the people that stood in front of him suffered from mental illness. A review from the Bureau of Justice Statistics shows that startling statistic to be a national trend, particularly among younger inmates. In the United States, 70% of local jail inmates 24 and under have been diagnosed with mental health problems. When police brought Blaec in for questioning about his gun purchase, the nation was in the aftermath of the 2012 Aurora, Colorado, movie theater shooting. Everyone was on high alert, anxious to prevent another awful tragedy. During interrogation, Blaec admitted to buying a ticket to the movie ""Twilight"" and he admitted to having homicidal thoughts a few years earlier at the age of 16. That alone was enough to put him behind bars with a prosecution team convinced they had just prevented a massacre. It was a sharp contrast to what his family and his doctors described to me. Scientists link 60 genes to autism risk . His psychologist John Phillips describes Blaec as a model patient. He told me he never saw Blaec as a threat and said Blaec never got into a fight or tried to break the rules. He told me Blaec's autism made it difficult for him to connect with others, and he saw a boy desperate for love and attention. His parents each told me they couldn't imagine Blaec ever hurting or killing anyone with the guns he purchased. According to a recent study in the journal Annals of Epidemiology, patients with mental illness are more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators. And when they are violent, it is most often directed at themselves. Blaec's psychiatrist Dr. H.J. Bains pointed out that unlike a patient with diabetes, Blaec will not get treatment for his illness in prison and will likely leave worse off than when he went in. Near the end of my interview with Tricia Lammers, I realized there was another reason for her pain. She had been the one to alert the authorities about Blaec buying the guns. She found a receipt in his pocket and became worried. She told me Blaec had asked her just days before if she felt he was a failure in life. She says it wasn't a mass homicide that concerned her but a lonely suicide. We all worry about our kids, and we strive for their happiness, first and foremost. The Lammers family is no different, and in this case Bill and Tricia believe they failed their son. His father wonders out loud if he should have spent more time with his boy and less time traveling. He wonders if there were signs he should have seen. He second-guesses his decision not to mortgage his home to pay for a special camp so many summers ago. He wonders if he should have kept those dirt bikes. When I reminded him Blaec bought the guns as a present, with the hope he could one day spend more time with his father, Bill was at a loss for words.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- The troubled Blackwater era ends in Iraq on Thursday as another firm takes over the once-dominant company's security services contract in Baghdad. A helicopter for the private security firm then known as Blackwater flies over Baghdad in October 2003. Triple Canopy, a Herndon, Virginia-based company, picks up the expiring contract of the security firm formerly known as Blackwater Worldwide, which changed its name to XE a few months ago. The U.S. State Department decided not to renew XE's contract in January. ""When the U.S. government initially asked for our help to assist with an immediate need to protect Americans in Iraq, we answered that call and performed well,"" XE spokeswoman Anne Tyrell said in a statement Wednesday. ""But we always knew that, at some point, that work would come to a close."" The end of the contract followed the Iraqi government's refusal to renew the firm's operating license because of a September 2007 shooting in which Baghdad says security guards -- then employed by Blackwater -- killed 17 Iraqi civilians. As part of a contract to protect American diplomats and other employees around the world, the State Department hired Blackwater for a multiyear assignment in Iraq, renewable annually. XE, one of three security firms working for the United States in Iraq, had one of the biggest contracts there, providing security for the sprawling U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. ""We are honored to have provided this service for five years and are proud of our success. No one under our protection has been killed or even seriously injured,"" Tyrell said. Many XE employees are expected to go to work for Triple Canopy, which already had a State Department contract in Iraq. Its new contract increases its share of the security work. DynCorp International also has a State Department contract for work in Iraq. Losing the contract is considered a huge blow to XE. While the company is privately held, the Iraq contract has been estimated to make up a third to a half of its business. XE has about two dozen aircraft in Iraq as well as 1,000 personnel. XE's statement acknowledged that the company's Baghdad ""task order"" ends Thursday but was mum on any other roles it still might have in Iraq. ""Any specific questions on the contract and how it will now be fulfilled should be directed to the State Department,"" Tyrell said. Despite the loss of the embassy security detail, XE continues to hold other contracts with the State Department to protect American diplomats elsewhere in the world. The company's founder, Erik Prince, resigned as head of the business in March. In January, five former Blackwater security guards pleaded not guilty to charges of voluntary manslaughter and other serious crimes stemming from their involvement in the September 16, 2007, incident in a Baghdad square. A sixth former security guard has pleaded guilty to charges of voluntary manslaughter and attempted manslaughter. Blackwater said its employees were returning fire after armed insurgents attacked them, but an Iraqi investigation concluded that the guards randomly fired at civilians without provocation. The Iraqi government said 17 civilians were killed, although the indictment alleges 14 died. The company does not face any charges. But the Baghdad incident exacerbated the feelings of many Iraqis that private American security contractors have operated since 2003 with little regard for Iraqi law or life. The indictment of the five men represents the first prosecution of non-Defense Department contractors under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act. The act was amended in 2004 to allow the Justice Department to prosecute such personnel providing services ""in support of the mission of the Department of Defense overseas."" Last year, the State Department renewed Blackwater's contract over strong objections from the Iraqi government. Starting January 1, the Iraqi government has mandated that all contractors obtain Iraqi licenses to operate.","The firm's contract was not renewed after a 2007 shooting in Baghdad .

"Washington (CNN) -- A bus crash that killed 15 people and injured 18 others was caused by a ""perfect storm"" of sleep deprivation, speed and lack of oversight, the National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday. The World Wide Travel motor coach was returning to New York City on March 12, 2011, with 32 passengers onboard after visiting the Mohegan Sun Casino in Connecticut. At 5:38 a.m. the bus was on I-95 near the Bronx Westchester County Line, when it crossed a 10-foot-wide paved shoulder, hit a guard rail, skidded 500 feet on its side and slammed into two 8 inch wide signposts that tore off almost the entire top of the bus, according to investigators. The driver, Ophadell Williams, ""was impaired by fatigue at the time of the accident due to sleep deprivation, poor sleep quality and circadian factors,"" according to the report. ""His lack of evasive braking or corrective steering action as the bus drifted off the roadway was consistent with fatigue-induced performance impairment."" Williams had little rest in the three days before the accident, only taking short naps inside the bus while passengers were in the casino gambling, investigators said. He was also speeding, driving 78 mph in the 50 mph zone in the minute before the accident, according to the NTSB examination of the bus data recorder. Investigators said if the bus had been driving at the speed limit it may not have overturned. At the time of the accident, police said Williams told them the accident occurred after he swerved to avoid a tractor-trailer that might have clipped the bus; however, the NTSB found no other vehicles were factors in the crash. The report says, ""Contributing to the accident was inadequate safety oversight of the accident driver by World Wide Travel's management."" The company has since shut down. Last year, Williams pleaded not guilty to charges of manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide for his role in the accident, according to court records. ""Fatigue and speed are an especially lethal combination,"" NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman said in a statement. ""Unfortunately, in investigation after investigation, we are seeing the tragic results of fatigue, which can degrade every aspect of human performance.""","15 died when bus crashed returning from casino in Connecticut .

"(CNN) -- Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is to be tried on charges of having sex with an underage prostitute and abuse of power.. A judge in Milan has ruled a fast-tracked trial before three judges should begin in the city on April 6. The case is the latest in a long-running series of legal wrangles featuring the scandal-plagued politician and billionaire media mogul. What is Berlusconi accused of? Prosecutors allege that Berlusconi paid for sex with a 17-year-old nightclub dancer, Karima El Mahrough, nicknamed Ruby. They also claim he abused his position when he intervened to get her released from the jail where she was being held on charges of theft. In Italy, the age of consent is 14, and it is not illegal to pay for sex. However, paying for sex with a minor (under 18) is a crime, and can be punished by up to three years in jail. Berlusconi has said the dancer had been introduced as a 24-year-old. Is this the only legal issue facing Berlusconi? No. The 74-year-old Italian PM, currently serving his third term in office, also faces charges of bribing British lawyer David Mills to secure favorable testimony in legal cases. His trial, suspended last spring after he was granted temporary immunity, resumes next month. Mills denied receiving bribes and his conviction in the case was overturned last year. He has survived a series of political, corruption and sex scandals over the years, involving allegations of embezzlement, tax fraud and bribery. Berlusconi has been tried on at least 17 charges since he was first elected prime minister in 1994, but none of the cases have resulted in lasting convictions; several were overturned on appeal. He has always denied any wrongdoing, and had previously claimed immunity from prosecution, though a 2008 law granting him this was overturned the following year. How has he reacted to the claims? Berlusconi insists he has never paid for sex -- ""not even once in my life"" -- and says any suggestion he did so is ""degrading for my dignity."" Both he and El Mahrough, who is now 18, deny ever having had sex with one another. But the young woman's former roommate told investigators that El Mahrough confided to her that she did have a sexual relationship with the premier. Berlusconi says he did call the police on El Mahrough's behalf, but denies this was an abuse of power. The billionaire media magnate and football club owner says the allegations against him are simply political mudslinging. His lawyers have called the investigation ""absurd and groundless"" and a ""grave interference"" in Berlusconi's private life. So what happens now? Judge Cristina di Censo has ruled that Berlusconi should face trial on the two charges -- having sex with an underage prostitute, and abuse of power. The court case, before three judges, is due to begin in Milan on April 6. Berlusconi's lawyers have previously argued that courts in Milan do not have jurisdiction in the case -- because of where the alleged crimes were committed -- or the authority to try a prime minister. Has the scandal damaged Berlusconi's reputation? Yes and no. Long-running scandals, a playboy lifestyle and a series of well-publicized gaffes have opened the Italian PM up to ridicule. There are signs Italians are tiring of the constant focus on his personal indiscretions, and many doubt the situation will improve. ""Should he resign? They all should resign; we are a joke. It is the country of jokes,"" Fedrica, a 22-year-old coffee shop assistant in Rome told CNN recently. Thousands of Italians took to the streets in cities across the country -- and in Tokyo and Geneva -- on February 12 in protest at Berlusconi's alleged behaviour  towards women. A poll in the Italian daily newspaper, Corriere della Sera, found 56 percent of those questioned no longer want Berlusconi as PM. A TV poll found 61 percent felt he should resign, but 59 percent believed the government would continue as it is until its mandate ends in 2013. Berlusconi has survived two votes of no confidence in recent months, and while his personal approval ratings have been dented, his party, the People of Freedom, still enjoys widespread support in Italy.","Prosecutors claim Berlusconi paid for sex with 17-year-old nightclub dancer .

"(CNN) -- Looking pale and gaunt, Matthew Todd Miller glanced away from the camera during his brief interview in North Korea. ""I will say that I prepared to violate the law of the DPRK before coming here,"" he told CNN's Will Ripley earlier this month. ""And I deliberately committed my crime."" But he didn't clarify what he meant by his ""crime."" On Sunday, Miller faces ""judgment date"" in North Korea. He will not learn of his charges until that hearing. According to North Korean state media, the 24-year-old American arrived as a tourist into the country on April 10. During entry, Miller tore his tourist visa and shouted that he would seek asylum and that ""he came to the DPRK after choosing it as a shelter,"" according to KCNA. The state-run media described Miller as having ""rash behavior"" and committing ""gross violation of its legal order."" When asked whether he sought asylum in North Korea. Miller told CNN that he had already addressed that in a previous interview ""so I'm not here to discuss more."" He is one of three Americans detained in North Korea; the other two are Kenneth Bae and Jeffrey Fowle. ""My situation is very urgent,"" Miller told CNN. ""That very soon, I'm going to trial and I will directly be sent to prison. I think this interview is my final chance to push the American government into helping me."" Was Miller seeking asylum? Miller traveled to North Korea after arranging a private tour through the U.S.-based Uri Tours, that takes tourists into North Korea. ""We do not have any understanding of why he ripped his visa,"" according to Uri Tours. ""While we do our best to vet each participant who joins a tour, it's not possible for us to know each person's motivations for traveling to the DPRK."" The tours are conducted despite U.S. State Department warnings that American citizens have been subject to arbitrary arrest and detention in North Korea. Miller stated that he wants the U.S. government to secure his release. He said he wrote a letter to U.S. President Barack Obama, but had received no reply, adding that he was ""disappointed in my government."" It's unclear whether his statements were made freely or under coercion. Miller's case presents many questions, said Robert Kelly, an American who teaches International studies at Pusan National University in South Korea . ""If he wanted asylum, why's he trying to get out?"" Miller asked. ""Now, he changes his mind? This is why the (U.S.) State Department encourages citizens not to go to North Korea."" Miller's roots . Little is known about Miller. In Bakersfield, California, where his family lives, a pink note was affixed on their front door that stated: ""Please do not disturb. We have no comment."" Close friends and neighbors contacted by CNN said they were instructed by the family not to speak to reporters. In a July interview, a neighbor told the Associated Press that Miller had first went to South Korea about four years ago to visit his brother and that he found a job teaching English. Miller was a 2008 graduate of Bakersfield High School, according to KBAK, a CNN affiliate in Bakersfield. A few classmates who spoke with CNN said that that Miller seemed like an average kid. Two of them said they barely remembered him, because he was so quiet. Americans held as bait? The detention of the three Americans is a sign that North Korea seeks U.S. attention, said Kelly, who runs an Asian Security Blog. Obama's policy of strategic patience could be a source of irritation for North Korea. ""It's a temper tantrum,"" he said. ""They don't really like being ignored. It's North Korea's ideology."" Americans previously detained in North Korea have been released after high-profile officials such as Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter visited the country. ""The big visits make them important and make them look like a superpower cares. It's important for regime legitimacy at home,"" Kelly said. Bill Richardson, the former governor of New Mexico, has made several trips to North Korea, beginning with a trip in 1994 when he negotiated the release of the remains of a U.S. serviceman. North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un's ""negotiating tactics is now reverting to what his father used to do when he held detainees and American prisoners,"" Richardson said earlier this month. ""They draw them out, they pressure them to admit that they were guilty, that they're being well treated, pleading to the American government to send an envoy to bring them back. ""They want something in return. The North Koreans want to dialogue with us."" CNN's Kyung Lah contributed to this report.","U.S. detainee in North Korea: I deliberately committed my crime .

"(CNN) -- The backup of boats and barges on a low-water section of the Mississippi River increased Tuesday even as the 11-mile stretch reopened on a limited basis, the U.S. Coast Guard said. New Orleans-based Coast Guard spokesman Ryan Tippets confirmed to CNN that five southbound vessels were able to pass near Greenville, Mississippi, Tuesday afternoon and evening. A limited number of northbound vessels with a draft of no more than 9 feet were being allowed to travel overnight into Wednesday. The stretch was closed Monday to most vessel traffic because of low water levels, idling 97 boats and barges, according to the Coast Guard. That number swelled to nearly 115 on Tuesday, Tippets said. This same area near Greenville, which sees about 50 vessels pass on an average day, has been closed ""intermittently"" since August 12, when a vessel ran aground, said Tippets. The Army Corps of Engineers has been dredging in the area to deepen the channel and help navigation. A historic drought and excessive heat have reduced water levels and scorched wide sections of the U.S. Midwest. Flooding last year may have worsened the situation on the Mississippi by leaving deposits of silt and debris in areas that would normally be clear. We are ""working to minimize the delay as much as possible and to get these vessels moving,"" Tippets said.","Low water levels have affected traffic on Mississippi River .

"Vicksburg, Mississippi (CNN) -- The flood-swollen Mississippi River was cresting at Vicksburg Wednesday night, hours earlier than anticipated but at a record level of 57 feet, according to the National Weather Service. ""Just because we're at crest at Vicksburg, or the level is starting to fall -- the water level is extra high,"" said Marty Pope, a senior hydrologist with the weather service's Jackson, Mississippi office. ""Residents who live along the river need to keep an eye out and be vigilant.  We're not going to fall to the kind of levels we got to during the large 2008 flood until early June, and won't fall below flood stage until mid to late June."" The river, originally forecast to crest at Vicksburg Thursday morning at 57.1 feet, was cresting ahead of schedule probably because an old levee system in Greenville, Mississippi, was breached last Friday and spread the flood's flow, Pope said. He said at Vicksburg the river could reach the 57.1 level as it crested -- more than 14 feet above flood stage and more than a foot over the record set in the city in 1927. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was keeping a watchful eye on the Yazoo Backwater Levee, which residents near Vicksburg were counting on for protection. It is designed to keep water from backing into the Yazoo River delta. The backwater levee was being ""armored"" by a heavy plastic coating to prevent it from washing out, said Charlie Tindall, attorney for the Board of Mississippi Levee Commissioners. But the Yazoo River backwaters were already claiming territory and property, as Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour was among residents owners who watched their rising waters swallow their houses and lands Wednseday. Laura Hipp, spokeswoman Barbour's office, confirmed that a house owned by the governor in his native Yazoo County was flooded by the watery onslaught moving southward down the Mississippi River. The house is on a lake in central Mississippi near the backwater-flooded Yazoo River. While areas downriver continued to brace for the growing flood, a glimmer of recovery hope flickered in one area upriver. Authorities in Tunica, in northern Mississippi, reopened a casino with an employee pep rally. ""We believe that reopening our doors and putting our friends and families back to work as quickly as possible is an important step on the road to recovery,"" the leaders of Gold Strike Casino and Resort said in a statement. Casinos are a critical economic driver in the region. Nine were closed due to the flooding of the Mississippi River, said Bill Canter, spokesman for the Tunica Convention and Visitors Bureau. Three will be reopened by the weekend, he said. But the area still has a long road ahead before full recovery. Residents of 300 structures under water at Tunica Cutoff are still out of their homes, said Larry Liddell, county spokesman.  ""The floodwaters need to recede 3 feet before they can go back,"" he said.  On Saturday, the local community is holding a ""High Water Music Festival"" to benefit the people of Tunica Cutoff. Gold Strike officials, in their statement, said the ""near-record flooding has caused untold damage."" Farther south, where the Mississippi River has not yet crested, residents were working Wednesday to clear out their homes and find ways to get by for coming weeks on higher ground. ""We're taking one on the chin -- not only for America but for Louisiana as well,"" said Guy Cormier, president of Louisiana's St. Martin Parish. His parish is in part of the state expected to be flooded as authorities open sections of the Morganza Spillway to help spare other areas of Louisiana, including New Orleans. ""It's really hard when you go and visit with a family who own and operate everything they have in the area,"" Cormier said. ""The decision has been made, and we're just going to have to battle it. But we're fighting people."" As of Wednesday evening, 17 bays were open at Morganza -- one more than earlier in the day --  moving water at an estimated 114,000 cubic feet per second, the Corps of Engineers said. Mandatory evacuations will be in effect Saturday -- beginning at midnight Friday -- in Butte Larose, Happy Town and the Sherburne Wildlife Management Area, the St. Martin Parish Sheriff's Office announced.  By 8 a.m. Saturday, ""the area will be secured and no one will be allowed to enter,"" the parish said in a news release. Downstream in Vidalia, Louisiana, residents and officials tried to counter flooding from the rising Mississippi by stacking large containers two- and three-high around riverfront properties. Temporary flood control barriers are protecting two medical facilities, a hotel and the city's conference and convention center, said city spokeswoman Sheri Rabb. The U.S. Coast Guard reopened a section of the river Tuesday that it had closed to prevent damage to levees from passing barges. But officials said only one tow vessel at a time will be allowed to pass through the 15-mile area near Vidalia and Natchez, Mississippi. And they warned they could shut the waterway again if water levels rise to 62.5 feet. ""We will continue to closely monitor transits through the area to ensure the safety of the communities as well as the towing vessels and their crews,"" Coast Guard Capt. Michael Gardiner said in a statement. Levees along the length of the river appeared to be holding, and water diverted through spillways seemed to be rising more slowly than expected, but Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal warned residents that plenty could go wrong. ""There's still an awful lot of water headed our way, and it's going to be here in many cases for weeks, not just a few days,"" Jindal said. Louisiana officials earlier issued advice to residents in flood-affected areas on how to prevent snake encounters and bites. Of the 22 species of snakes within the Morganza Spillway, three -- the copperhead, cottonmouth and canebrake rattler -- are venomous. Officials said the spillway gates are likely to be open for weeks, and it will be weeks before the river falls below flood stage, allowing those who have evacuated to return safely. In Mississippi, 4,937 people have been displaced by flooding so far, said Jeff Rent, a spokesman for the state Emergency Management Agency. In Louisiana, more than 4,000 people have evacuated, Jindal said, citing figures compiled by parish authorities. But, he said, no shelters have been opened in the state. By the weekend, floodwaters also are expected to peak at record levels in Natchez as well as in Red River Landing and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, according to the National Weather Service. The flood is the most significant to hit the lower Mississippi River valley since at least 1937 and has so far affected nine states: Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. Despite the misery and destruction, some residents in flooded areas are trying to make the best of a bad situation. ""You know I always wanted to fish off my front porch, but I never wanted to do it this way,"" former Poinsett County, Arkansas, Judge Doyle Hillis told CNN affiliate KAIT-TV in Jonesboro, Arkansas.  ""We've had a lot of laughs over it, but we've had a lot of sad minutes."" Hillis, who has lived in Weona for 66 years, said he would have never thought the water could get that high. While he wasn't able to land a big catch, he said the fishing helps to keep his mind off the devastation. ""It's going to be a crying shame when the water goes down and they're actually going to see the damage they are going to have,"" Hillis said. CNN's John King, Ed Lavandera, Martin Savidge, Ed Payne, Ashley Hayes, Ben Smith and Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","NEW: The Mississippi is cresting near Vicksburg ahead of schedule .

"(CNN) -- U2 lead singer Bono has been discharged from a German hospital where he was treated for a back injury, concert promoter Live Nation said Tuesday. The band's North American shows have been postponed until next year, Live Nation said. And the group has canceled a planned headline appearance at the Glastonbury Festival in England next month, organizers said on their website. Bono suffered a serious back injury Friday while preparing for the resumption of the band's U.S. tour, the band said, and had emergency surgery. ""Bono suffered severe compression of the sciatic nerve,"" Dr. Muller Wohlfahrt said in a statement provided by the concert promoter. ""On review of his MRI scan, I realized there was a serious tear in the ligament and a herniated disc, and that conservative treatment would not suffice. I recommended Bono have emergency spine surgery with Professor (Joerg Christian) Tonn at Munich's LMU University Hospital on Friday."" Tonn said Bono was in severe pain and had already suffered partial paralysis in his lower leg when he was referred. ""The ligament surrounding the disc had an 8-millimeter tear, and during surgery we discovered fragments of the disc had traveled into the spinal canal,"" Tonn said in the statement. ""This surgery was the only course of treatment for full recovery and to avoid further paralysis."" Tonn said Bono is now ""much better"" and has regained all movement. ""The prognosis is excellent, but to obtain a sustainable result, he must now enter a period of rehabilitation,"" Tonn said. Eight weeks of rehabilitation is considered a minimum, Wohlfahrt said. U2 Manager Paul McGuinness said the band is working with Live Nation to reschedule the tour dates. ""Our biggest and I believe best tour has been interrupted and we're all devastated,"" McGuinness said in the statement. ""For a performer who lives to be on stage, this is more than a blow. He feels robbed of the chance to do what he does best and feels like he has badly let down the band and their audience. Which is of course nonsense. ""His concerns about more than a million ticket buyers whose plans have been turned upside down we all share, but the most important thing right now is that Bono make a full recovery.""

"(CNN) -- Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi appeared Monday either to not know that demonstrators in cities throughout Libya are calling for an end to his rule or not accept it, according to excerpts from the interview, which a U.S. official described as ""delusional."" ""No demonstration at all in the streets,"" he told ABC News and the BBC in a joint interview carried out at a restaurant in Tripoli, excerpts of which were posted on the BBC's website. Told by the BBC's Jeremy Bowen that he had seen demonstrators in the streets that morning, Gadhafi asked, ""Are they supporting us?"" Gadhafi, wearing sunglasses and clad in brown tribal clothing, refused to accept the reporter's assertion that they were not. ""No. No one against us. Against me for what?"" He repeated his assertion that he is not president, but one of the people. ""They love me, all my people with me, they love me all. They will die to protect me, my people. No, no."" Asked why his people had captured and were holding the nation's second-largest city, Benghazi, Gadhafi said it was al Qaeda, not the Libyan people, who had done so. ""Al Qaeda,"" he said. ""They came from outside."" ABC's Christiane Amanpour, in a posting on the network's website, said Gadhafi arrived for the interview in a small convoy of sedans accompanied by little security. ""Gadhafi said he wanted to speak to the press to get the truth out, and he spent more than an hour with us trying to put forth his side of the story,"" Amanpour wrote. He questioned how the international community could freeze his assets, impose sanctions and embargo arms sales based on media reports, and invited the United Nations to carry out an independent ""fact-finding mission,"" she reported. He vowed not to leave Libya, she reported, and denied having used force against his people. ""He seemed to be in complete denial about the protests against him, and that other big cities in Libya, particularly those in the east, had been taken by his opponents,"" she said. ""He simply rejected the notion that any walls were closing in on him. He denied he was besieged in the capital and said he would survive the current situation."" He reiterated an assertion he first made last week that his opponents have been given hallucinogens by al Qaeda operatives, and he said he felt betrayed by the United States, which had lifted its sanctions on the country after Gadhafi agreed to give up his pursuit of weapons of mass destruction in 2003. ""I'm surprised that we have an alliance with the West to fight al Qaeda, and now that we are fighting terrorists they have abandoned us,"" he said, according to Amanpour. ""Perhaps they want to occupy Libya."" Gadhafi called U.S. President Barack Obama a ""good man"" but said he might have been given ""misinformation."" ""The statements I have heard from him must have come from someone else,"" Gadhafi said. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice was unimpressed. ""It sounds, just frankly, delusional,"" she told reporters. ""And when he can laugh in talking to American and international journalists while he is slaughtering his own people, it only underscores how unfit he is to lead and how disconnected he is from reality. ""It makes all the more important the urgent steps that we have taken over the course of the last week on a national basis, as well as the steps that we've taken collectively through the United Nations and the Security Council, and we're going to continue to keep the pressure on."" She called on Gadhafi ""to step aside to prevent further bloodshed and to allow the Libyan people to have a government that is responsive to their aspirations.""","NEW: ""It sounds, just frankly, delusional,"" says U.S. ambassador .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan was taken into custody at the end of Friday's hearing in her necklace theft case after the judge sentenced her to 120 days in jail for violating her drunk driving probation. The actress was expected to post a $75,000 bond at the jail and be freed. The judge granted the bond after her lawyer filed a notice of appeal. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner also ordered Lohan to serve 480 hours of community service, including 360 hours at a downtown Los Angeles women's center. Sautner suggested Lohan might behave better after seeing ""how truly needy women and women who have fallen on real hard times have to live."" She must complete another 120 hours of community service at the Los Angeles County morgue. The judge also ruled Friday that the necklace theft case against Lohan will go forward to trial, but the felony charge was reduced to a misdemeanor. ""I'm going to give her an opportunity,"" Sautner said. Sautner did not buy the defense argument that Lohan accidentally walked out of a Venice, California, jewelry store wearing a necklace that later appeared around her neck in photographs taken five days later. ""If in fact it was an accident, she could have called the store back,"" Sautner said. Defense attorney Shawn Holley argued that Lohan was busy and scattered when she was at the store and absent-mindedly walked out with the necklace. ""It's undisputed that Ms. Lohan walked out of the store with the necklace on,"" Holley said. The prosecution must show she had ""specific intent to permanently deprive the store of that necklace."" ""I see the intent here and the level of brazenness to say 'Let me see what I can get away with here,' "" Sautner said. A police detective testified that Lohan's assistant handed the necklace to a police officer after learning through a website posting that police had obtained a search warrant hours earlier to search for it in her home. Prosecutor Danette Meyers argued that ""it doesn't take a rocket scientist"" to realize Lohan returned the necklace to police because she knew her home was about to be searched. Lohan's trial date was set for June 3, but she must return to court for a hearing May 11, the judge said. A misdemeanor could still result in up to a year in prison for Lohan. Before delivering the good news to Lohan about the reduction of the charge, the judge addressed her much-publicized misbehavior. ""She thumbs her nose at the court,"" Sautner said, referring to an incident with another judge last year. ""She walks into court with 'F U' on her fingernails. I don't know what that means unless it has 'I am' before it."" The jeweler who accused Lohan of stealing the gold and diamond necklace testified Friday that she had not gotten any money from selling the security camera video of the actress in her store. Kamofie and Company owner Sofia Kamen was the second witness called by the prosecution in the preliminary hearing. Holley used the the store's licensing of the video, for a reported $40,000, to question Kamen's motives in accusing Lohan of theft. All of the money from the video licensing went to publicist Christopher Spencer, who Kamen said she fired last month because he was negotiating deals for the store that she was not interested in, she testified. Spencer subsequently disputed Kamen's account. Kamen said that she realized the necklace was missing 10 minutes after the actress left the store last January. She wasn't closely watching Lohan, even though there was another incident four days earlier in which the actress almost walked out wearing a diamond earring. ""We thought it was an accident,"" Kamen said. ""We weren't thinking that she would take it."" The first prosecution witness was Tinelli Comsooksri, a store employee who was working the day of the earring incident. ""She was covering the earring that she still left on with her hair,"" Comsooksri said. She stopped Lohan as she was walking out, Comsooksri said. As prosecutor Meyers held the infamous necklace, now known as ""People's Exhibit 2,"" Kamen testified that it was priced at $2,500 although it cost the store only $850. She explained that retail jewelers routinely triple the wholesale price. The value of the necklace was a crucial issue for Lohan for the felony grand theft charge to be reduced to a misdemeanor. Shoplifting offenses are charged as petty theft if the property taken is valued at less than $950. Lohan has been in court nine times in the past year, mostly for hearings related to probation violations for her 2007 drunk driving case. She did a short stint in jail last year, but she also checked into substance abuse rehab twice under court order.","NEW: The judge sentences Lohan to 120 days in jail for a probation violation .

"(CNN) -- Citing a continued improvement in the security climate in Saudi Arabia, the United States has authorized the return of all family members to U.S. diplomatic outposts in the oil-rich monarchy. At the same time, the U.S. State Department is recommending that Americans there continue to adopt security precautions in the Middle Eastern kingdom and ""keep a low profile."" The directive, dated Thursday, is an update to a travel warning issued in February. The diplomatic posts in question include the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh and the U.S. consulates in Jeddah and Dhahran. The Eastern Province and Riyadh were singled out as areas where security has improved. ""The last major terrorist attack directed against foreign nationals was in 2007. Significant measures since then by the Saudi government have greatly improved the security environment throughout the kingdom,"" the State Department travel warning said. The State Department emphasized that ""an ongoing security threat"" persists and citizens should consider risks of visiting the kingdom, where militants maintain a presence. American visitors should be careful to select living arrangements that have ""stringent security measures."" ""There is an ongoing security threat due to the continued presence of terrorist groups, some affiliated with al Qaeda, who may target Western interests, housing compounds, hotels, shopping areas, and other facilities where Westerners congregate. These terrorist groups may employ a wide variety of tactics and also may target Saudi government facilities and economic/commercial targets within the kingdom,"" the department said.","The last major terror strike in Saudi Arabia occurred in 2007 .

"Brisbane, Australia (CNN) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in the northern Australian city of Brisbane to a scorching spring day, and a distinctly chilly reception. Putin, in Australia with other world leaders for G20 talks, stepped off his flight from Moscow to be greeted by Australia's deputy defense secretary, a junior minister in Prime Minister Tony Abbott's cabinet. Standing nearby was a much bigger political personage, Australian Attorney-General George Brandis. Brandis made no attempt to greet the Russian leader. Not long after, though, Brandis was filmed enthusiastically welcoming Germany's Angela Merkel and Chinese President Xi Jinping. If Putin had seen the local Courier Mail newspaper in the short limousine trip to his hotel he would have noticed a giant front page graphic of a Russian bear complete with fur cap, matching up to a boxing kangaroo, above the headline ""Ice Cold War."" Inside, splashed across two pages, was quote after quote from Abbott, revealing details of his 20-minute conversation with Putin on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting in Beijing last week. Abbott said he told Putin that he should stop trying to ""recreate the lost glories of tsarism or the Soviet Union,"" and he accused Russia of stepping up its aggression, which was part of a ""regrettable pattern."" Putin is clearly an isolated figure by Western leaders in particular at the two-day G20, after reports that Russian troops and heavy weapons are being sent across the Russian border to separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. British Prime Minister David Cameron warned Russia on Friday to change its course regarding Ukraine. Otherwise, he said, ""The relationship that Britain has with Russia, that the European Union has with Russia, the relationship that I hope Australia has with Russia, will be very different."" And Australia continues to show its anger towards Russia over the downing of MH17, which claimed the lives of 28 Australian citizens when the plane went down over Ukraine. Add to that a flotilla of four Russian naval vessels off the coast of Australia, and tensions in Brisbane are running pretty high. Putin for his part remains unrepentant, and apparently unruffled. He told the Russian news agency in an interview on the eve of the Saturday and Sunday G20 that sanctions against Russia are against the principle of the World Trade Organization and undermine ""the whole system of international economic relations."" That is unlikely to cut much ice here. Ukraine is not officially on the agenda but it looms large over this gathering. The summit brings together the leaders of the United States, Britain, Germany and France -- countries that have been leading the sanctions against Russia. The G20 is a grouping whose job is actually to focus on financial and economic matters. Indeed, the stated aims of host Australia is to launch a new road map to boost global economic growth by two percentage points above the existing targets by 2018, mainly through infrastructure spending, streamlined financial services, and a crackdown on tax laws. But that's playing second fiddle to a real-time diplomatic drama unfolding in Brisbane. The heat is on, and it's not just the unseasonably warm weather.","World leaders are in Australia for the G20 summit .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Officials investigating last week's crash of two Metro subway trains said a system used to detect trains in the area of the accident had failed intermittently in the days immediately before the fatal crash. Investigators are shown at the crash scene in Washington. Nine people were killed in the June 22 accident. Officials earlier reported that the track circuit had been repaired June 17, five days before the crash. In an update Wednesday, the National Transportation Safety Board added that after the repair, the circuit ""periodically lost its ability to detect trains."" The NTSB says the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority reported the problem during a post-accident review of track circuit data, but it was not immediately clear if operators were aware of the problem before the accident. A call to the transit authority was not immediately returned. In a prepared statement, Metro General Manager John Catoe said the track circuit data problem ""... is not an issue that would have been easily detectable to controllers in our operations center."" He said Metro is working with the NTSB to find the ""root cause"" of the accident, and said he wanted to assure metro riders that the system ""is as safe as it can be."" Nine people were killed in the June 22 accident. According to the NTSB, which is investigating the crash, maintenance records show that an ""impedance bond"" for the track circuit where the accident occurred was replaced June 17. The NTSB says it is now reviewing documentation on the performance of the track circuit both before and after the June 17 repair. Since the accident, the transit authority has stopped using a computer system designed to avoid collisions and is operating the trains manually, leading to delays. The NTSB, meanwhile, has been conducting nightly tests at the accident scene between the Fort Totten and Takoma stations. On the weekend of July 18, investigators intend to conduct tests to determine when the stopped train would have been visible from the train that struck it. The previously reported rail-streak marks consistent with heavy braking were approximately 125 feet long, and began approximately 425 feet before impact.","Officials earlier said track circuit had been repaired June 17, five days before crash .

"(CNN) -- Google has finally broken its silence on the mysterious structure atop a barge floating in the San Francisco Bay. ""Google Barge ... A floating data center? A wild party boat? A barge housing the last remaining dinosaur? Sadly, none of the above,"" the company said in a statement e-mailed Wednesday to CNN and other news outlets. ""Although it's still early days and things may change, we're exploring using the barge as an interactive space where people can learn about new technology,"" the statement continued. The barge, docked at a pier on Treasure Island, houses a four-story structure made from shipping containers. Speculation about its purpose has been swirling since discovery of the vessel -- and of three similar barges across the country -- first made headlines early last week. Google's brief statement is consistent with a report last week by CNN affiliate KPIX-TV in San Francisco, which said the mystery barge would house a floating showroom for the company's Google Glass connected eyewear and other products. KPIX reported the barge structure will become one of a small fleet of luxury event spaces, complete with party decks, designed to be disassembled and transported via barge or train to other locations. The barges are an effort by Google to upstage rival Apple's stylized retail stores, a source told KPIX. Until now, Google had declined to comment on the reports, contributing to an aura of secrecy that has cloaked the entire saga. The mystery barge has inspired jokes and at least one Twitter parody account, @GoogleBarge, which has more than 5,500 followers. A tweet from the account Tuesday said. ""No one raised an eyebrow when Howard Hughes built my ancestor back in 1973. It was another media frenzy out here today. Sheesh!"" Google Glass, worn like regular glasses, has a small high-res display above the user's right eye and lets wearers use voice commands to shoot photos or videos and access e-mail, text messaging and other features.","Google: Mysterious barge in San Francisco Bay will house an 'interactive space'

"(CNN) -- I always pictured myself graduating from college, getting a cool job and even having a cute little place of my own. So far, I have a master's degree, and I got the coolest job ever as an emergency medicine physician assistant. But instead of waking up in a posh apartment, I hear the early-morning sounds of my family dog barking and my parents making coffee downstairs. At 27, I still live with my parents, and I love it. That's right. Despite the bad press my generation of ""boomerang millennials"" has generated, some of us are happy and even grateful to have a soft place to land after college, even if we're gainfully employed. My decision to live at home was not one of absolute necessity. As a physician assistant, I make a good salary and would be able to live on my own comfortably if I needed to do so. By the time I finished graduate school, I had amassed a $150,000 debt from both undergraduate and graduate tuition. With several of these loans earning a 7.9% interest rate, my father calculated that my loans were increasing by $15 a day in interest alone. I was astounded. At this rate, it would take me 30 years to pay off my student loans, with much of it going straight to interest. I thought of my options: Live on my own and pay rent, utilities and food costs, as well as skyrocketing student loans, or move back in with my parents and pay an all-encompassing, smaller monthly rent that would allow me to try and get a jump on my student loans. I chose the latter. Beyond the endless supply of home-cooked meals, the best thing about moving back home is that I am not alone. Several of my physician assistant friends are in the same boat as I am -- we are all highly educated, white-collar employees who live at home. Our co-workers in the medical field think it is a great idea because many of them are facing the same gut-wrenching piles of debt. They often say if they could do it all again, they would do the same thing. With so many millennials moving back in after graduation, the term ""boomerang generation"" was born. About three in 10 adults ages 25 to 34 still live at home, according to a 2012 study by Pew Research Center. The number of young adults living at home hit a low in the 1980s, but it's been on the rise since the recession started in 2007. About a quarter of these individuals felt their living situation was bad for their relationship with their parents. There's a stigma that comes along with this arrangement. Some people might assume that we are mooching off our parents or that we're too lazy to find a job. I don't think my neighbors understand it, as they continually ask me when I am going to graduate and if I am old enough to babysit their children. My mom is quick to dispel any negative comments from people we know though. She just tells people that I'm successful, well-educated and that I save lives. Millennials aren't saving a dime . I love living at home. There is a constant supply of coffee and people to pal around with, and I've been slowly chiseling away at my student loans for the past year. Now that I've paid off $68,000 of my student loans, those loan payments aren't nearly as nauseating as they used to be. I'll be honest, moving back home did take some getting used to. My parents were extremely gracious in opening their home back up to me as I trampled into their empty nest. I was not used to having to tell anyone what time I would be home, where I was going and what I was doing. I agreed to keep them posted on my whereabouts so they don't worry if I'm not home at a certain time. As for my parents, they had to get used to me coming home at all hours from the hospital, trying to be quiet while I sleep during the day after working the night shift and putting up with the horrible television shows I like to watch. Our new relationship is symbiotic. My parents benefit from having an extra set of hands around the house to help with chores and a constant source to explain all pop-culture references. In terms of romance, I am 27, and my boyfriend is 33. He is not allowed upstairs and has to sleep on the couch if he stays over. Thankfully, he is understanding and has a place of his own. I spend a couple of nights a week hanging out at his place. As it stands right now, I say that I am going to move out next year. But honestly, I have no reason to do so. Moving out on my own would mean that I would have to cook for myself, clean my place and go grocery shopping. I know that I can live on my own if I need to, but right now I don't want to. I am fortunate to have such loving parents, and I understand that not everyone is lucky enough to be in this same situation. Thankfully, my parents have not told me I need to move out by a certain point. If I stay here long enough, I might get to the point where I start telling people that my parents live with me. But as it stands right now, I live with them, and society should be OK with that. First Person: A fat girl gets naked . First Person: My life as a little person .

"(CNN) -- Garth Brooks is still holding out hope he can do shows in Ireland despite the Dublin city council saying no to two of them. Brooks told the Irish promoter after the city's approval of just three shows he would wait ""to the last second"" before sending his crew and gear back the the United States. ""I cannot begin to tell you how badly my heart is breaking right now,"" the singer wrote in a note to Aiken Promotions on Tuesday. Brooks' rep on Wednesday provided CNN a copy of the note. The Dublin shows had been planned for Croke Park Stadium, a football arena that can hold more than 90,000 fans, on five consecutive nights during the last week of July. The council approved Friday, Saturday and Sunday shows, but rejected licenses for Monday and Tuesday night concerts. The promoter, saying Brooks insisted on five shows or none at all, announced Tuesday that all concerts of ""The Garth Brooks Comeback Special Event"" were canceled and the 400,000 tickets sold would be refunded. A measure of the demand to see Brooks perform live is impressive, considering the 400,000 tickets sold represent nearly one of every 10 people in the Republic of Ireland's 4.5 million population. ""I hope you understand that to play for 400,000 people would be a dream, but to tell 160,000 of those people that they are not welcome would be a nightmare,"" Brooks wrote. ""To do what the city manager suggests (play three shows and not all five) means I agree that is how people should be treated and I just can't agree with that."" While the promoter surrendered Tuesday, saying it had ""exhausted all avenues regarding the staging of this event,"" the note revealed that Brooks held out some hope. ""Our guys are still en route and if there is any chance that the five planned concerts can be salvaged and nobody is being let down then we can proceed as planned until the refunds begin,"" he said. ""If you tell me, 'Garth, thanks but it is over.' I will cease my efforts and bring our people and gear back to the States. If you think for any reason that the 'powers that be' in Ireland can fix this, then I will faithfully go to the last second."" One of Brook's biggest hits was a country tune about ""Friends in Low Places."" The city council noted the stadium was ""in a heavily populated residential area"" and five nights of Brooks would be ""an over intensification of use of the stadium."" The traffic, noise and ""potential antisocial behaviour"" by Brooks fans could add up to ""an unacceptable level of disruption"" for Dublin residents, the council said. The city promised residents it would limit the number of special events to three each year when the stadium was renovated several years ago. It already hosted three concerts in May, the council's statement said. Brooks was the biggest selling solo recording act ever when he left the road and studio behind to concentrate on raising his three daughters 13 years ago. Fans have only seen him perform since then at a few benefit concerts and a weekend residency in Las Vegas. Garth Brooks works weekends in Vegas . His youngest daughter Allie graduated from high school in May, relieving Brooks of his paternal duty to drive his kids from his farm in Owasso, Oklahoma, to school each morning and be there for every soccer match. Brooks revealed last December in a ""Good Morning America"" interview that wife Trisha Yearwood and his daughters had given him approval to launch a world tour in 2014. He has scheduled a news conference on Thursday but it is not known whether it will be a new tour announcement. CNN was first alerted to this story through a Twitter posting.

"(CNN) -- The family of Terri Schiavo has joined the battle over Jahi McMath, a 13-year-old girl on a ventilator who has been declared dead by doctors. ""Together with our team of experts, Terri's Network believes Jahi's case is representative of a very deep problem within the U.S. healthcare system -- particularly those issues surrounding the deaths of patients within the confines of hospital corporations, which have a vested financial interest in discontinuing life,"" the Terri Schiavo Life & Hope Network said in a prepared statement. The organization said it has been overseeing the efforts of several groups to help get Jahi transferred out of Children's Hospital Oakland and brought ""to a safe place."" Jahi's family said Tuesday it had found a facility in New York willing to take her. The Oakland hospital ""refused to agree to allow us to proceed in that matter,"" Jahi's uncle Omari Sealey said. The hospital denied the accusation. ""We have done everything to assist the family of Jahi McMath in their quest to take the deceased body of their daughter to another medical facility,"" hospital spokesman Sam Singer said. ""To date, they have been unwilling or unable to provide a physician to perform the procedures necessary, transportation, or a facility that would accept a dead person on a ventilator. Our hearts and thoughts go out to them in this tragic situation, but the statements being made by their attorney and some family members are misleading and untrue."" Family attorney Christopher Dolan had accused the hospital of being ""hell bent"" on ending Jahi's life. A judge has declared Jahi brain dead as well. Doctors say there's no chance she will come back to life. Omari Sealey, Jahi's uncle, said Wednesday that the family still hopes to move her to another facility. He accused the hospital of starving his niece by not using a feeding tube to provide her with nutrients. Singer said a judge Tuesday had dismissed the family's request for additional medical procedures, including a feeding tube. A deadline loomed Monday as a judge had said the hospital could disconnect the machines after 5 p.m. (8 p.m. ET). But shortly before Jahi could have been cut off, that same judge extended his order to 5 p.m. (8 p.m. ET) on January 7. Terri Schiavo died in 2005, nearly two weeks after doctors removed the feeding tube that had sustained her for more than a decade. She was severely brain damaged and became a national focal point in the right-to-die battle. Her husband and guardian, Michael Schiavo, said she wouldn't have wanted to live in her condition, which Florida courts deemed a ""persistent vegetative state."" Her parents fought to have her kept alive. ""Persistent vegetative state,"" however, means the brain still has some activity, even though the patient is in a deep state of unconsciousness. Another word for this is ""coma,"" according to the National Institutes of Health. Schiavo's parents, brother and sister created the Life & Hope Network. The statement Wednesday about Jahi included a quote from Bobby Schindler, Terri Schiavo's brother and executive director of the organization. ""Families and individuals must make themselves aware of what so-called 'brain death' is and what it is not,"" he said. ""Every person needs to understand that medical accidents happen every day. Families and individuals must be more aware of the issue of accountability and patient rights."" Last month, Jahi had surgery to remove her tonsils, adenoids and extra sinus tissue. Doctors had recommended the surgery to treat pediatric obstructive sleep apnea, a condition that made her stop breathing in her sleep and caused other medical problems. Before the surgery, Jahi said she was worried that she would never wake up, according to her uncle. She seemed fine after the surgery and asked for a Popsicle because her throat hurt. It wasn't long before something went terribly wrong. In the intensive care unit, the girl began bleeding profusely -- an image that her mother told CNN would be forever seared in her mind. According to family members, Jahi went into cardiac arrest. Days later, she was declared brain dead. Hospital officials have said privacy laws prevent them from discussing details of the case. CNN's Elizabeth Landau contributed to this report.","Jahi McMath's uncle says the family still hopes to move her to another facility .

"(CNN) -- No way, Jose. What else can you say when Jose Canseco -- the former baseball slugger who accidentally shot his own finger last month -- claims that part of said finger fell off during a poker tournament? No word yet on whether Canseco won the hand, but he doesn't seem to be too broken up about it, given the tenor of his Twitter feed. ""I put my finger in the freezer,"" he wrote. ""Anyone want appetizers?"" The joke stems from an incident earlier this week that no one else has reported independently, outside of Canseco's tweets. He claims that someone has a video of part of his finger coming off during a poker tournament, yet that footage hasn't been broadcast by anyone. Jose Melendez, Canseco's representative, told CNN that the ex-player's camp has the video and may sell it to media outlets. For now, though, all the world has to work from is Canseco's Twitter feed -- the same place where, just a few days ago, he was opining that ""comet transport is the key to our survival"" in the wake of the European Space Agency's putting a vehicle on a comet after a 310-million mile journey. And, even for those with a strong stomach, it's a lot to digest. It starts with his admission Friday that ""my finger fell off"" during a poker tournament the previous night. Canseco then chimes in with this tweet: ""My finger should have been amputated from the beginning. It was very loose with no bone to connect it. it was also smelling really bad."" And for good measure, the one-time Oakland A's basher shared a gruesome photo Saturday of his finger before it fell off. ""I bet a long time ago you could easily loose (sic) a finger a hand or even your life in a poker game if you couldn't pay up,"" Canseco joked. It all stems from an incident last month, when Canseco accidentally shot himself in a finger on his left hand while cleaning a handgun, according to Las Vegas police. Canseco tweets photo of wounded hand . The incident helped bring Canseco -- who won the American League Rookie of the Year award in 1986, was the league MVP two years later and finished his 17-season career with 450 home runs -- back into the public spotlight. Besides his exploits on the field, the admitted steroid user has claimed there was widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs in Major League Baseball.

"(CNN) -- Both Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic were rattled at the World Tour Finals on Saturday but ultimately won their semifinals to set up a blockbuster. Federer saved four match points to inflict a devastating 4-6 7-5 7-6 (6) defeat on Davis Cup teammate Stan Wawrinka at the O2 Arena in London in easily the best match of a tournament that has featured an overflow of lopsided results. ""I'm very lucky,"" Federer told the crowd. ""Stan played better from the baseline. I kept believing. I kept fighting."" Wawrinka, now 0-11 on hard courts against Federer, will have to put the disappointment behind him as he'll be on the same side as his more famous Swiss in next week's Davis Cup final at France. Whereas Djokovic wasn't happy with the crowd Saturday in his 6-1 3-6 6-0 win over Kei Nishikori, Federer was annoyed with French chair umpire Cedric Mourier. Having the momentum after breaking Wawrinka at love to end the second set, Federer thought he won the first point of the third set on his serve. But he apparently didn't hear Mourier overrule a Wawrinka ball originally called wide. When Wawrinka earned the next two points, the score went to 0-40 when Federer thought it was 15-30. He aired his views to Mourier but the score stood and Wawrinka then broke. Even more drama unfolded later. Federer saved three match points at 4-5 in the third on Wawrinka's serve and another on his own serve at 5-6 in the tiebreaker before converting on his first chance. It was the third time he saved match points this year, the other occasions coming against Gael Monfils at the U.S Open and Leonardo Mayer in Shanghai. A day after clinching the year-end No. 1 spot for the third time, meanwhile, Djokovic moved closer to another significant milestone at the World Tour Finals. If he defeats Federer on Sunday, the Serbian would become the first man since Ivan Lendl in 1987 to claim three consecutive titles at the elite year-end championships. Federer leads their rivalry 19-17 and triumphed in Shanghai but Djokovic has won 31 straight indoor matches. The 33-year-old Federer also played for nearly three hours Saturday and has significantly less time to recover. Djokovic would not have been the crowd favorite anyway, but his negative reaction when fans cheered a double fault in the second set against Nishikori might lose him more supporters. He replied by applauding sarcastically. ""The crowd has a right to do what they want, to cheer for whoever they want,"" Djokovic told reporters. ""(There were) some individuals that were going over the line throughout the whole match, some provocations that I usually don't react on, but I did. ""It was my fault. I lost concentration."" Nishikori had upended the world No. 1 at the U.S. Open in the last four on a sweltering September day, but Djokovic gained his revenge with an easy win indoors at the Paris Masters this month. The way Saturday's affair started -- that, too, was an indoor duel -- it looked like a repeat of the Paris tussle. The exciting Japanese baseliner was hindered by a right wrist injury. Djokovic cruised in the first, needing a mere 22 minutes and dropping 11 points. When he broke in the first game of the second, this edition of the World Tour Finals was on course for an 11th straight-set result in 13 matches. Djokovic, however, double faulted for 1-1 and that was when the momentum shifted. Nishikori broke for 5-3 to the crowd's approval with a winning forehand after Djokovic misplayed a smash and had his older rival in trouble to begin the third. ""I allowed myself to be in that situation to lose the set, maybe even lose the match,"" said Djokovic. ""Generally it was my fault and I should know better."" Facing the second of two break points in the first game, Djokovic almost double faulted when he struck a heavy second serve. Later in the point, Nishikori misfired on a backhand down the line. It was the turning point of the set. Djokovic immediately broke for 2-0 and coasted, with Nishikori double faulting on match point. ""First couple points in the third set, I thought I had it,"" said Nishikori, the first Asian man to reach a grand slam final. ""I think I start thinking too much (that) he's (the) No. 1 player, Novak. I think I risked too much. ""I think I did too many unforced errors first couple games. Then he started playing better.""","Novak Djokovic defeats Kei Nishikori to reach the final at the World Tour Finals .

"(CNN) -- Saying Web access is essential for students to compete in a wired world, President Obama on Thursday will announce an initiative to bring high-speed Internet to almost all of the nation's schools by 2018. At a speech in a high-tech middle school in Mooresville, North Carolina, Obama was scheduled to order federal agencies to earmark funds for providing broadband and wireless access to 99% of U.S. public schools in the next five years, according to senior administration officials. The president is tasking the Federal Communication Commission with spearheading the project, and is also asking the FCC to fund high-speed connections at libraries. ""We are living in a digital age, and to help our students get ahead, we must make sure they have access to cutting-edge technology,"" said Obama in a statement released by the White House. ""So today, I'm issuing a new challenge for America -- one that families, businesses, school districts and the federal government can rally around together -- to connect virtually every student in America's classrooms to high-speed broadband internet within five years, and equip them with the tools to make the most of it."" At least one FCC member has alreasdy signaled she's on board with the effort. ""President Obama's ConnectED initiative recognizes that access to adequate broadband capacity to our schools and libraries is not a luxury -- it's a necessity for America's next generation of students to be able to compete ...,"" FCC commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, who was nominated by Obama, said in a written statement.

"Victorville, California (CNN) -- Mike McStay has come to this remote swath of Southern California desert to say goodbye. To his brother, Joseph McStay. His sister-in-law, Summer. His two nephews, 4-year-old Gianni and 3-year-old Joseph Jr. All four ended up here, in an unincorporated area north of Victorville, in a pair of shallow graves, for reasons no one has been able to explain. There's no bringing them back. But Mike McStay promises they will get justice, once their killers are found. ""You guys are cowards,"" he said. ""And all of America is coming after you. And we're going to find you. And we're going to prosecute you."" If and when authorities track the person or people responsible down, as they're taken through the criminal justice system, they will have company. Mike McStay vows: ""I'm going to be there every step of the way. And I'm going to be there when you meet your fate."" So who are the culprits? Why did they kill the McStays? And how did they end up here -- the husband and wife in one grave, their two sons in the other -- their bones visible in the dirt to a motorcycle rider going through? All good questions without answers, officially at least. In February 2010, the McStays had a busy but seemingly happy life in Fallbrook, a community of about 30,000 people about 18 miles from the Pacific Coast and 50 miles north of San Diego. In addition to chasing after their two little boys, Joseph and Summer -- who married three years earlier -- were remodeling their home. ""They were happy,"" Mike McStay told HLN's Nancy Grace earlier this month. ""And that's part of the mystery."" The last documented sighting of them was February 4, 2010. The family's locked, abandoned Isuzu Trooper was located four days later in San Ysidro, California, having been towed from the Mexican border. Did they cross over? Surveillance video taken that night shows a family fitting the description of the McStays walking into Mexico. But it has never been confirmed it was them. Or, if it was, that they ever came back. Mike McStay, for one, says he doesn't believe this video shows his brother. ""That's certainly part of this huge puzzle,"" San Diego County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Jan Caldwell said of reports that the family crossed into Mexico and ate dinner and drank cocktails there. ""What happened here? Was that part staged? Did they actually cross into Mexico?"" Caldwell added, ""We still think that there's a strong possibility that they did. When did they come back? Were they under duress? I mean, these are all questions that we we want to find out."" On February 15, relatives called the sheriff's department to report the family missing. At the home, there were eggs on the kitchen counter, bowls of popcorn in the living room, and two dogs. But no trace of the McStays. The next three years were filled with speculation, fear and hope. Rick Baker published a book, ""No Goodbyes,"" on their plight. Mike McStay and other family members tried to keep the case alive. Then came the call to the San Bernardino County Sheriff-Coroner Department around 10 a.m. on November 11. A motorcyclist said he had spotted skeletal remains in a sandy, scrubby High Desert area between Quarry Road and Interstate-15, the highway Angelenos take to get to and from Las Vegas. Otherwise, though, it could well have been considered the middle of nowhere -- some 105 miles north of the McStay's hometown of Fallbrook, and 160 miles north of San Ysidro. Four days later, the sheriff's identified the victims as the McStays. The San Bernardino Sheriff's Department has deemed their deaths homicides, but it did not give a cause in order ""to protect the investigation."" ""Every available resource will be utilized in this investigation to identify the suspects involved in this heinous crime and bring them to justice,"" said Sheriff John McMahon. Their bones gone, large crosses now mark the spot where the McStays ended up. Approaching their makeshift grave for the first time, Mike McStay said what he sees indicates to him that the guilty party knew what they were doing. ""You see how this is kind of sunken down?"" he said. ""It gives you a little cover from the road. Somebody had to know the area, had to know you needed a four-wheel drive."" Couple lost on snow-covered road writes goodbye letters, prepared to die .

"San Diego (CNN) -- As you have probably noticed, human beings will sometimes do dumb things. Like step onto someone else's property late at night or in the early morning hours, whether innocently or not so innocently. But that doesn't give other people license to overreact and use deadly force to kill an unarmed trespasser. The law of man says so but so does the code of common decency. Still, when a tragedy occurs, those who grieve over the loss of loved ones are sure to find little comfort in the fact that the person who caused their pain is condemned, tried and punished. That's why the goal should be to avoid such unfortunate occurrences in the first place. Which brings us to Montana, and a story with blame to go around and no happy ending. My son is only 7, but someday I'd like him to have the experience of studying abroad. Of course, I want him to be safe. So when the time comes, I'll be sure to give him some basic tips on how to stay out of harm's way. Such as: Always be aware of your surroundings and be cautious around strangers. Don't stay out after midnight or venture into parts of a city with which you're not familiar. Don't flash money or otherwise draw attention to yourself. Now it seems I must add one more item to the list: Don't break into someone's home, especially late at night or in the early morning hours. It's rude, because you're a guest in someone else's country. It's wrong, because you have to respect another person's property. It's probably against the law, no matter what country you're in. It could also be dangerous. If the homeowner catches you and feels the least bit threatened, he might do whatever he feels is necessary to protect himself, his home and his family. You could get hurt or even worse. Consider what happened to Diren Dede, a 17-year-old German exchange student who was fatally shot at a private residence in Missoula, Montana. Dede was shot by 29-year-old homeowner Markus Kaarma after the teenager did something he should not have done: wandered uninvited into Kaarma's garage in the early morning hours. The garage door was open, and -- according to the criminal complaint that has since been filed against Kaarma for deliberate homicide -- his companion, Janelle Pflager, intentionally left her purse out in plain view ""so that they would take it."" She also installed sensors and a video monitor so the couple could keep tabs on what was going on in the garage. By ""they,"" Pflager appeared to mean whomever happened to come along and fall into the trap. She told police that the couple had been burglarized twice in the past several weeks, and they were fed up. They wanted to catch someone in the act. They did. According to the complaint, Kaarma -- a U.S. Forest Service firefighter -- told police that he saw images on the video monitor, grabbed his shotgun and fired four times into the garage. Dede was shot, taken to the hospital and later died from what police describe as serious injuries to his head and arm. Dede had no business in that garage. If he had never entered it, he'd be alive today. And yet Kaarma is no hero. This was no spontaneous act of self-defense. The homeowner was on the equivalent of a hunting trip. He laid a trap, and then waited for someone to walk into it. In fact, according to the complaint, Kaarma told the woman who cuts his hair that he had been burglarized before and that he was staying up late at night ""just waiting to shoot some (expletive) kid."" The more you read about this story, the less sympathetic Kaarma becomes. He sounds like a crime victim who turned into a vigilante who was just waiting to mete out his own punishment on the next person he perceived as wronging him. But he's the one who is in the wrong. So far, we have at least two people behaving badly. Care to make it three? Celal Dede is the dead teenager's grieving father. He told a German news agency that the culprit in this tragedy was the gun culture in the United States. ""America cannot continue to play cowboy,"" Celal Dede said. Ouch. The way the father sees it, his son was killed for simply trespassing on someone's property. The punishment didn't fit the crime, he insists. He's right about that. Even if Diren entered the garage with the intent of stealing something as opposed to simply snooping around, he still didn't deserve to die for the transgression. The homeowner obviously got carried away. And, if convicted, he should spend the rest of his life in prison because of it. But the father is wrong to blame the American gun culture. That's a sweeping generalization. And, as an outsider, he should tread more lightly. Not every American owns a gun. The issue isn't guns or cowboys. Nor is the issue those notorious ""stand your ground"" laws. Kaarma's defense lawyers say they will invoke Montana's so-called castle doctrine, which allows use of force to ward off unlawful entry of a home if the person reasonably believes it necessary to stop an assault or prevent a felony. The issue is responsibility. Those responsible might also include Celal Dede, the boy's father. After all, someone apparently raised this young man to believe it was fine to trespass on a stranger's home. Was it society, his peer group or his parents? What happened in Montana was a terrible occurrence but one that could have been avoided if three people had behaved differently and made better choices.","Homeowner sets trap, and a 17-year-old from Germany is killed .

"(CNN) -- Home alone with her 3-month-old son, Sarah Dawn McKinley of Blanchard, Oklahoma, said she decided to make a stand when two men tried to break into her home on New Year's Eve. McKinley, who had been widowed less than a week before, placed a couch in front of one door and went to the bedroom and put a bottle in her baby's mouth before calling 911, she said on HLN's ""Dr. Drew"" on Wednesday. A 911 operator calmly spoke with McKinley, who asked if it was permissible to shoot an intruder, officials said. ""I've got two guns in my hand. Is it OK to shoot him if he comes in this door?"" asked McKinley, 18. ""Well, you have to do whatever you can do to protect yourself,"" dispatcher Diane Graham responded. ""I can't tell you that you can do that, but you do what you have to do to protect your baby."" In the end, McKinley fired a 12-gauge shotgun and killed Justin Shane Martin after he entered her residence, according to a Blanchard Police Department affidavit filed in court Wednesday. Martin was armed with a knife, authorities said. ""You have to make a choice, you or him. I chose my son over him,"" McKinley told CNN Oklahoma City affiliate KWTV. First Assistant District Attorney James Walters told CNN that McKinley will not be charged because she acted in self-defense. ""A person has the right to protect themselves, their family and their property,"" Walters said. As for the 911 operator's guidance? ""I would agree with that advice,"" the prosecutor said. Graham was the first of two 911 operators to speak with McKinley. The dispatcher told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell on Wednesday she learned in training that she could not tell a caller to shoot someone, ""(but) as a mother, I wanted her to protect her baby."" ""She did a very good job in keeping her (McKinley) calm,"" Grady County Sheriff Art Kell said of Graham. ""Her job is to make sure the person on the phone is comfortable ... to give them support."" McKinley was on the phone with a second dispatcher when she pulled the trigger. McKinley's husband died Christmas Day of cancer, Walters said. Evidence indicates Martin and Dustin Louis Stewart, 29, may have been looking for painkillers or other drugs taken by McKinley's ill husband, Walters said. Investigator found no such drugs, he told CNN. McKinley said she believes the men were coming after her, rather than intending to commit a robbery. According to the affidavit, the men approached McKinley's mobile home Saturday afternoon. Martin had devised a plan to burglarize the residence, police said. Stewart told investigators he and Martin ingested hydrocodone about 30 minutes before reaching the rural home, the affidavit states. Martin ""aggressively"" knocked on the doors of the home and gained entry by hitting one of them with his shoulder, police said. Stewart said ""he heard a gunshot after Martin entered the residence,"" and Stewart then ""fled on foot."" McKinley said she had pushed the couch against the door to deter entry. ""When he busted in the door I saw something shimmering in his hand,"" the mother told HLN. ""I thought it was a pistol at first, but it was a 12-inch hunting knife. I didn't know (that) until after I shot and killed him."" Martin, 24, was found between the door and a couch with a knife clutched in his gloved left hand, police said. Stewart was charged with first-degree felony murder, Walters said. If during the commission of certain offenses, such as burglary, a death results, an individual can be charged in the death, the prosecutor said. Kell said Stewart is in jail, with a bond hearing scheduled for Thursday in Chickasha. CNN's calls to police in Blanchard, about 25 miles south of downtown Oklahoma City, were not immediately returned Wednesday. Stewart's attorney, Stephen Buzin, told CNN he will seek bond. Buzin would not comment on specifics of the case against his client. ""We will let the facts come out at trial and feel comfortable with his innocence,"" the attorney said. Martin recently had approached McKinley's home, saying he wanted to introduce himself, Walters said. The man said he worked for the owner of the property on which McKinley lived, she told HLN. McKinley, also armed with a pistol, was on the phone with authorities for 21 minutes, Walters said. ""She remained as calm as one could under the circumstances and had the forethought and called 911, as everyone should,"" he said. McKinley was asked on ""Dr. Drew"" whether she regretted shooting Martin. ""No. We could have been in a whole different situation if I hadn't done it,"" she replied.","NEW: Mother tells ""Dr. Drew"" she does not regret pulling trigger .

"(CNN) -- The chances you'll die from heart disease are good -- too good. Heart disease is the leading cause of death for Americans. It's especially of concern for women, since symptoms can be different from those seen in men, according to the American Heart Association. The good news is, you have a tremendous ability to keep yourself from becoming a sad statistic. Here are five simple things you can do to take better care of your ticker. Get some zzz's . You need seven to eight hours a night to be well-rested. Sleep is not just downtime. It's when your brain forms new pathways to help your memory. It's when your heart and vascular system get a break, as your blood pressure and heart rate slow down. If you don't get enough sleep, your body constantly produces adrenaline and stress hormones to keep you awake. That means your blood pressure and heart rate doesn't slow down as well, and that hurts your heart. Your sleeping body also produces cytokines, which helps your immune system fight infections and chronic inflammation. Studies show poor sleep -- anything less than six hours -- hurts women more than it does men. Get active (yes, including sex!) Any kind of exercise is essential for your heart, including sex, studies show. ""My guess is the 'get more sex (suggestion)' was published by a man,"" Dr. Deidre Mattina joked. But the Henry Ford Health System cardiologist admits she has ""written on my prescription pad that a patient should have more chocolate, sex and coffee."" All of those, in moderation, are good for stress relief, she said. Studies do show that sex is a significant form of exercise. Mattina recommends you get at least 30 minutes a day of moderate-intensity exercise whether it is at the gym, in your neighborhood or even in your bedroom. Something as simple as walking counts -- ""as long as when I call you on the cell phone I can tell by your breathing that you are exercising,"" Mattina said. ""You can't just be on a stroll window shopping."" Exercise lowers your blood pressure, helps you lose weight, increase your good cholesterol (HDL), reduces your bad cholesterol (LDL) and increases your insulin sensitivity. Only about 20% of American adults meet the minimum standard for exercise recommended by the federal government, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That standard is 2Â½ hours a week of moderate aerobic exercise like walking or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise like jogging. Being overweight is also hard on your heart, so if you want to lose weight aim for 60 to 90 minutes of exercise a day, according to Dr. Carol Ma, a cardiologist at Florida Hospital in Orlando. ""I tell my patients you should have a BMI that's less than 25 and a waist that measures less than 35. That's pretty specific, but that's what you need for a healthy heart,"" Ma said. Raise a glass -- and maybe a carrot -- to your heart . A drink a day can keep the heart doctor away. If you do drink (don't start for a healthier heart), Mattina suggests one alcoholic beverage is enough (for the guys it's two). Any more can stress your heart. A drink, by the way, is not an extra-large tumbler. It's 12 ounces of beer, 4 ounces of wine, 1.5 ounces of 80-proof spirits or 1 ounce of 100-proof spirits. This is not just limited to red wine, which does have heart-healthy antioxidants. There is evidence to suggest a drink can increase levels of ""good"" cholesterol and protect against artery damage. Alcohol can also help you relax. Eating healthy is also essential -- watch refined sugar, salt and fat and eat lots of fruits and vegetables (in the 4.5 cup range). Keep a close eye on salt. Most Americans eat too much and over 75% of it comes from packaged foods or from eating out. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggest limiting salt to less than 2,300 miligrams per day -- that's about 1 teaspoon. Ma also tells her patients to keep a healthy heart diet high in omega-3 fatty acids like what you find in fish. Don't let your doctor be lonely . Get screened for heart disease. Regular screening can catch risks early and prevent problems down the road. The kind of tests you need depend on your age, how much exercise you get, how great your diet is and your family history (if your parents or brothers and/or sisters have heart problems, you're at risk). The American Heart Association suggests everyone start monitoring heart health by age 20. Your doctor should check your blood pressure, your weight and your cholesterol and triglyceride levels. High blood pressure greatly increases your chance of having heart problems. If your blood pressure is above 120/80mm, you may want more regular checks. Blood pressure can be controlled through medication or a better diet and exercise. Starting at age 45, get your blood glucose levels checked. High blood glucose levels -- a sign of Type 2 diabetes -- can lead to heart disease and stroke. You may also want a more comprehensive heart screening. At Henry Ford where Mattina works, a typical heart screening involves all the tests you should have in your 20s. A BMI test is performed and your waist circumference measured. The electrical activity in your heart is monitored, and you'll undergo what's called a carotid intima-media thickness test. Essentially, the two major arteries in your neck are screened for signs of hardening (an early sign of disease). A carotid and peripheral arterial disease screening looks for blockages in your legs, neck and arms. Your blood sugar is measured, your lipid profiles are tested and your cholesterol checked. ""We do a lot of sick care in medicine these days,"" Mattina said. ""I think we need to be more aggressive and look for potential problems before they happen because what we generally have now isn't enough."" For women, it's especially important to know the signs of heart trouble, as they can differ from symptoms in men. Instead of the classic chest pain with exertion, women may experience this pain while resting or have a sensation in their neck or jaw -- or classic symptoms that can be confused with gastro-intestinal disease. ""Women are so busy taking care of everyone else they put themselves last, but they have to take care of themselves when it comes to their heart,"" Ma said. Quit smoking . ""This is No. 1 on my list,"" Mattina said, and Ma agreed. Mattina said when she sees a young patient who has a heart attack, 90% of them admit to being smokers. It's a little known fact, but most smokers die from heart disease long before they'll get lung cancer. There are fewer smokers these days, according to the CDC but the number of women who quit has plateaued. Smoking is still the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. It tends to create blood clots, decreases your levels of good cholesterol, makes it harder to exercise and can raise your blood pressure temporarily.","Heart disease is the No. 1 killer of Americans .

"(CNN) -- The first hint something was amiss was the knock on the door from a television reporter. Elaine McClain and her husband, David McClain, of Sanford, Florida, were not expecting a journalist to drop by looking for George Zimmerman, the man who says he fatally shot an unarmed teenager in self-defense. The death of Trayvon Martin has sparked strong reactions across the country, and those sentiments made their way to the unassuming McClains. The next day, a letter arrived with ""Taste the rainbow"" written on the envelope in felt-tip pen. That is the slogan for Skittles candy. When he was shot, Martin was carrying Skittles candy and a can of iced tea he had purchased from a nearby convenience store. The letter was followed by a parade of reporters arriving at the McClains' home. Only then, Elaine McClain said, did she and her husband learn that director Spike Lee had retweeted a message to his 250,000 followers with the couple's address, identifying it as George Zimmerman's home. The McClains have a son whose middle name is George and whose last name is Zimmerman, but he has no connection with the controversy. After the tweets, with hate mail arriving and strangers with microphones knocking on the door, the McClains left their house for a hotel. Lee apologized on Twitter to the couple and asked people to leave them in peace, and on Thursday, Elaine McClain said, Lee called her and gave a sincere apology. Lee also told her he would pay the couple's cost of having to leave their home, Elaine McClain said. The family's attorney, Matt Morgan, said Lee reached an agreement with the couple. ""The McClains are relieved that this matter is now behind them,"" Morgan said. ""We had a very sincere and heartfelt conversation with Mr. Lee today. His apology was genuine and our clients were grateful. We asked Mr. Lee to do the right thing and he did."" The McClains said they were not seeking financial gain from their troubles. David McClain said he simply wants to get his life ""back to a rational state."" Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer who says he killed in self-defense last month, lives more than 4 miles from the McClains. He is reported to be in hiding. CNN's Selin Darkalstanian, Michael Martinez and John Branch contributed to this report.","NEW: Director Spike Lee apologizes to couple and will pay costs of their leaving home .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A London tabloid declared Sunday that ""secret FBI files"" reveal Michael Jackson paid millions to silence dozens of boys he abused. The story quickly echoed throughout global media, perhaps in part because of the trial of the Jackson family's wrongful death lawsuit against a concert promoter and the recent suicide attempt by Jackson's teenage daughter. A website can enjoy a sharp spike in traffic -- which can translate into advertising revenue -- with a sensational headline. But journalists and others who have closely followed the controversies and legal fights surrounding the pop star found the description by the Sunday People newspaper of the documents as being from FBI files to be questionable. 'Recycled tabloid reports' ""None of this is new -- zero -- and there was no FBI involvement,"" said CNN Special Investigations reporter Drew Griffin. ""It just sounds like recycled tabloid reports from 20 years ago."" Griffin saw and reported on the same material more than a decade ago as a local Los Angeles reporter. ""The bottom line is this stuff was not in the FBI files,"" said Tom Mesereau, the lawyer who successfully defended Jackson against child molestation charges in a lengthy trial in 2005. ""The FBI closed the investigation. It sounds like a bunch of utter nonsense."" Journalist Diane Dimond, who is no defender of the pop icon, also attacked the Sunday People article. ""It is obvious the paper took this old story and proceeded to make it seem new by adding numbers to it -- 24 boys paid off $35 million by Michael Jackson,"" Dimond said. ""The problem is there's no evidence to back up the claim that Jackson made that many payoffs."" Dimond's book ""Be Careful Who You Love: Inside the Michael Jackson Case"" details her coverage of allegations of improper relationships between Jackson and boys. The tabloid report was published at a critical time for the Jackson family, as its wrongful death lawsuit against a concert promoter entered its 10th week and while Jackson's daughter, Paris, is being treated after a reported suicide attempt. ""The files will also dismay Jacko's kids, Prince, 16, Paris, 15, and 11-year-old Blanket, who have not yet come to terms with losing their father,"" the Sunday People story said. Michael Jackson considered the British tabloids' use of ""Jacko"" to be a derogatory term. Griffin, Dimond and Mesereau each point to Paul Barresi, a former porn actor who lost his private investigator's license for fabricating evidence, as the person who possessed the material published Sunday. It included an audio recording of an interview done by Jim Mitteager, a reporter with the U.S.-based Globe tabloid, with a couple who worked as chefs at Jackson's Neverland Ranch. Mitteager left the tape to Baressi when he died of cancer in 1997. ""Paul Barresi made it no secret over the years that he had come into possession of the Mitteager tapes and that they included a long interview with Philip and Stella LeMarque, the former live-in couple at Neverland,"" Dimond said. Â ""He discussed the tapes and their contents with me on several occasions."" Griffin said Barresi also gave him access to the material years ago. It included reports Barresi wrote when he worked for now-disgraced celebrity investigator Anthony Pellicano. Pellicano is serving a 15-year federal prison sentence for a wiretapping and racketeering convictions. Porn star turned P.I. ""Since Barresi has fairly recently been stripped of his P.I.'s license, I can imagine that money has been tight for him,"" Dimond said. ""My best guess is that the UK paper offered Mr. Barresi several thousand dollars for his copies of the old Pellicano files."" When CNN called Barresi on Tuesday to ask if he sold the materials to the newspaper, he responded: ""I have no comment and that's all I have to say."" But before the question could be posed, he asked if the reporter wanted to know how many times he's had sex in a hammock. He explained it was a common question people ask because of his porn film career. Barresi's films, with titles such as ""Married Men with Men on the Side"" and ""Leather Bears and Smooth Chested Huskies,"" won him the X-Rated Critics' award for best ""group grope scene"" in 1985 and he was inducted into the GayVN's Hall of Fame in 2008. Barresi, now 60, retired from the porn business to focus more on his investigative work, but court records suggest he was not as successful in that work. He obtained a California private investigator's license in 2009, but lost it three years later. He signed a ""stipulated settlement"" with the state admitting that he faked a report about an ex-girlfriend's drug use to get her fired from her hospital job as a nurse in 2011. Federal court records also show Barresi and his wife filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2010. Tabloid stands by story . A Sunday People spokesman would not confirm that Barresi was the paper's source or if it paid for access, but he did stand by the story. ""Our article clearly states that we have seen copies of reports, phone transcripts and interviews carried out by an agent working for private investigator Anthony Pellicano who had been hired by Michael Jackson,"" Rupert Smith said in an e-mail to CNN. ""The files were seized by the FBI when Pellicano was himself investigated in 2002. The documents then became part of the FBI's files on Jackson case numbers CADCE MJ-02463 and CR 01046."" In fact, the FBI released files it collected on Michael Jackson in December 2009, six months after his death. Most of them related to the federal agency's support of the California investigations of child molestation allegations against the entertainer. Los Angeles Police, who were investigating child molestation allegations against Jackson, called the FBI's Los Angeles office in September 1993 to suggest the agency look into a ""possible federal violation against Jackson concerning transportation of a minor across state lines for immoral purposes (Mann Act)"", one document said. The Los Angeles County district attorney did not pursue criminal charges against Jackson, but the singer did reach a confidential financial settlement with the 1993 accuser, Jordan Chandler, and his father after they filed a lawsuit. Reports at the time said the Chandlers got between $16 million and $20 million from Jackson's insurance company. The Chandler accusation became a key part of the prosecution's case when Jackson was tried and acquitted of molestation a decade later in Santa Barbara County, California. Mesereau, who reviewed the 330 redacted pages released by the FBI, said the documents purported by the newspaper to have been included in the files were not there. CNN also reviewed the files, which are still posted on the FBI website, and found none referring to other payoffs by Jackson. None of the file numbers matched those quoted by the newspaper. ""You can imagine what the prosecutor in Santa Barbara would have done with this information if they really had it,"" Mesereau said. Phillip LeMarque did testify, telling the court that he once caught Jackson improperly touching then-child actor Macaulay Culkin while he worked as Jackson's self-described cook and ""majordomo"" for about 10 months in 1991. Culkin, the second witness called in Jackson's defense, denied any improper touching by Jackson. Jackson's guilt is 'inconsequential' Barresi represented the LaMarques in an attempt to sell their story to tabloid media outlets, Mesereau said. LeMarque admitted at the trial that he tried to make money from his story, even meeting with Barresi, who promised him $100,000 from the tabloid press, maybe more if the story were dirtier. ""He began to make the story more and more graphic as the price went up,"" Mesereau said, referring to Phillip LaMarque. ""Was it true that the broker told him the payoff might be higher if Mr. Jackson's hand was inside Culkin's pants?"" Mesereau asked during cross examination. ""That's what he said,"" LeMarque said. Barresi discussed his deal with the LaMarques in an interview for a PBS ""Frontline"" documentary in 1994. ""My interest in helping them was that they promised me a percentage of what they made,"" Baressi said. ""I was not on any kind of crusade to bring anyone to justice.Â  Whether Michael was guilty or innocent at that point was inconsequential.Â  My interest was strictly for the money, as was theirs, I might add.""","CNN's Drew Griffin: ""None of this is new -- zero -- and there was no FBI involvement""

"(CNN) -- Investigators -- asked to determine if a possible new clue is linked to the disappearance of Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway -- now hope to learn Thursday whether a jawbone found on an Aruban beach belongs to an animal or a human. Results from the testing of the bone were expected to be returned Wednesday, but investigators were held up by a technical delay. If the bone is human, authorities will then attempt to find out through DNA testing whether it belongs to Holloway, who was last seen on the island in 2005. It is being evaluated at the Netherlands Forensic Institute in The Hague, Netherlands, Aruban prosecutor Peter Blanken said this week. Holloway's dental records were sent to the forensic institute on Wednesday, the FBI said. ""We provided her dental records to the Dutch authorities. They were sent electronically,"" said FBI spokesman Paul Daymond. The information-sharing is ""what we do, nothing out of the ordinary,"" he said. The Holloway family had told HLN's ""Nancy Grace"" that the records were sent to the Hague. The length of testing can vary, but normally takes about a week, according to a representative of the institute.  The findings will be sent back to the prosecutor's office in Aruba, which will decide whether to make the results public. Part of a jawbone with a tooth was found on Friday by an American tourist near the Phoenix Hotel, a large resort on the western side of Aruba, Blanken said. Contacted by CNN, the hotel referred questions to local authorities. The prosecutor said the bone was initially examined by a forensic expert in Aruba, who determined the bone was from a young woman. But Blanken cautioned the final determination would be made by the forensic institute in the Netherlands. Holloway was 18 when she was last seen in the early hours of May 30, 2005, leaving an Oranjestad, Aruba, nightclub with Joran van der Sloot and two other men. She was visiting the island with about 100 classmates to celebrate their graduation from Mountain Brook High School in suburban Birmingham, Alabama. Van der Sloot was detained twice in connection with Holloway's disappearance but never charged. He is now awaiting trial in Lima, Peru, on a murder charge in the death of Peruvian student Stephany Flores. Her body was found in May in a hotel room registered to van der Sloot. The two were seen entering the room on a surveillance camera. Van der Sloot, 23, is also charged with wire fraud and extortion in Alabama for allegedly attempting to extort more than $250,000 from Holloway's family in return for disclosing the location of her body.

"(CNN) -- Natalee Holloway's family may soon learn whether a jawbone found on an Aruban beach last week belongs to the 18-year-old teen, who disappeared five years ago. Investigators are first trying to determine whether the bone is that of an animal or human. If the bone is human, authorities will then attempt to find out through DNA testing whether it belongs to Holloway, who was last seen on the island in 2005.

"(CNN) -- Consumerism is threatening to undermine measures by governments worldwide to combat climate change effectively according to a report by a U.S. think tank. In its ""State of the World 2010"" report, the Worldwatch Institute warns that without a shift from consumerism to sustainability ""no government pledges or technological advances will be enough to rescue humanity from unacceptably hazardous environmental and climate risks."" The 27th annual report by the Washington, D.C.-based research organization says the world consumed $30.5 trillion goods and services in 2006 -- up 28 percent on the figure recorded 10 years earlier. The rise means that the world now digs up the equivalent of 112 Empire State Buildings in materials every day with the typical American consuming an average of 88 kilograms (144 pounds) of goods every day -- more than the average weight of an average U.S. male -- the report says. Erik Assadourian, senior researcher and director of the 2010 report told CNN: ""In essence, the whole point of the report is to say that for humanity to thrive long into the future we'll need to transform our cultures intentionally and proactively away from consumerism towards sustainability."" The 244-page study details the work of 60 authors who explain strategies and present examples of cultures reorienting away from excessive consumption towards sustainable practices. ""There are six key societal institutions -- education, business, government, media, traditions and social movements,"" Assadourian said. ""We break those six apart and address how we can use those institutions now to help create a cultures of sustainability."" In the chapter ""Rethinking School Food: The Power of the Public Plate,"" authors Kevin Morgan and Roberta Sonnino highlight the example being set in Italy. ""Italian schools have been sourcing locally for decades,"" they explain, ""often complementing their emphasis on local products with a wide range of educational initiatives for children and their parents that emphasize the values of seasonality and territoriality."" New eco-communities like Vauban in the German city of Freiburg are singled out for praise in the chapter ""Building the Cities of the Future."" The 5000 residents in the new neighborhoods inthe south of the city power their homes and business using 100 percent renewable electricity. Assadourian believes the path towards sustainability will also be aided by harnessing social marketing to spread a new message. ""Despite the vast majority of media today reinforcing consumerism, there are efforts worldwide to tap media's vast reach and power to promote sustainable cultures,"" he said. ""No longer is it enough to simply change our lifestyles. We have to take an active role in changing the very cultures we are part of.""","U.S. think tank urges cultural shift away from consumerism to rescue humanity from climate change .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama's re-election campaign released its June fundraising numbers Monday, reporting that it raised $71 million to Republican opponent Mitt Romney's approximately $100 million. The campaign responded with thanks to the more than 706,000 donors who got the campaign to that point but also appealed for more money. ""We still got beat -- and not by a little bit,"" Ann Marie Habershaw, chief operating officer for Obama for America, said in the e-mail. ""If we lose this election, it will be because we didn't close the gap enough when we had the chance."" To be sure, neither campaign is raking in chump change. As we did with Romney's contributions, here's what the president could get for his $71 million. 2,071 students could attend the Sidwell Friends School for a year. Daughters Sasha and Malia attend the exclusive private school in Northwest D.C. (you could also afford hot lunches). At $34,268 annually, the school's tuition ranks higher than the average private university tuition in the United States and more than double what it costs to go to a public university. 32,272 Portuguese water dogs. At approximately $2,200 per pet, Bo, the first dog, could take on 32,272 purebred, hypoallergenic friends. 479,729 J. Crew Pembridge Dot pencil skirts. First lady Michelle Obama wore one at 10 Downing Street to meet British Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife, Samantha, and on ""The Tonight Show"" with Jay Leno. The double-worn mint green skirt runs $148 at the American clothing chain. 8 million pounds of arugula. While in Iowa in 2008, Obama was criticized for being out of touch after he asked a group of farmers whether they had checked out the price of arugula at Whole Foods. The boutique grocery store didn't open its first Iowa store until spring of this year, and several people present at his speech admitted they didn't know what arugula was. The current price is about $9 per pound. 3 Martha's Vineyard estates. The Obamas won't be going on vacation to Blue Heron Farm, otherwise referred to as the ""Summer White House"" off Cape Cod, and not just because of the demanding campaign schedule. The compound, which includes two full-sized homes, a par-3 golf hole and equestrian facilities, was listed in August for $23.7 million. 18,525 orders of Ben's Chili Bowl's chili half-smokes and cheese fries for the next year. At $10.50 per order, the Obama favorite could be a feast for a lot of your closest friends for the next 365 days. 65,558,632 Yuengling Lagers. At $6.49 per six-pack, the cost of one of Obama's favorite beers is approximately $1.08. Triple the cost at a bar, and you could still enjoy the company of 22 million other people -- 7% of the U.S. population -- sipping on the Pennsylvania brewery's finest . 417,671 Spalding official NBA game balls. $71 million buys almost a half-million of the $169.99 basketballs. That means with 10 people to a court at a time, more than 4 million people could play one of Obama's -- and Americans' -- favorite sports simultaneously. Take 7,099 couples on a Hawaiian vacation. The first couple could spring for the $10,000 to bring that many couples with them on a five-day holiday to the president's home state.","Obama raised almost $30 million less than Romney in June .

"Washington (CNN) -- An Arkansas man charged with murder will be retried on the most serious offenses after the U.S. Supreme Court concluded Thursday a hung jury in his original criminal prosecution did not prevent the state from getting a second chance at a conviction. The 6-3 majority rejected the appeal of Alex Blueford, accused of killing his girlfriend's infant son. ""The jury in this case did not convict Blueford of any offense, but it did not acquit him of any either,"" said Chief Justice John Roberts. ""When the jury was unable to reach a verdict, the trial court properly declared a mistrial and discharged the jury. As a consequence, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not stand in the way of a second trial on the same offenses."" Blueford was prosecuted for capital murder, but the death penalty was waived if he were to be convicted. But the trial judge said the Pulaski County jury could also consider three less serious crimes. During deliberations, the judge asked for a progress report, and the panel's forewoman in open court announced the jurors had rejected the capital and first-degree murder charges, but could not agree on manslaughter. They eventually deadlocked, and because of that, the 12 members did not even consider a separate, negligent homicide charge. The judge then declared a mistrial, but refused to give Blueford a partial victory on the capital and first-degree murder charges. Prosecutors then decided to retry the 29-year-old man on all the charges. The second trial was postponed until the high court could decide whether the defendant's constitutional rights were being violated. The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment prevents trying a person again for a crime after a verdict of not guilty. But state courts around the country are at odds on whether split verdicts on some counts allow retrial on all counts. Roberts, writing for the majority, said trial courts could. ""We have never required a trial court, before declaring a mistrial because of a hung jury, to consider any particular means of breaking the impasse -- let alone to consider giving the jury new options for a verdict,"" he said. Justice Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Stephen Breyer, and Samuel Alito supported the decision. Blueford had argued the jury should have been allowed to ""give effect"" to the jury's internal votes of not guilty on capital and first-degree murder. Justice Sonia Sotomayor agreed. ""At its core, the Double Jeopardy Clause reflects the wisdom of the founding generation ... that one acquittal or conviction should satisfy the law,"" she wrote in a dissenting opinion. She added, ""This case demonstrates that the threat to individual freedom from reprosecutions that favor states and unfairly rescue them from weak cases has not waned with time. Only this court's vigilance has."" Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan joined the dissent. The Little Rock defendant was prosecuted in the November 2007 death of 20-month-old Matthew McFadden Jr. The state said the boy's brain injuries were comparable to someone being dropped off a building. Blueford told police it was an accident, that he ""reflexively elbowed"" the child into a nearby chair. The case is Blueford v. Arkansas (10-1320).","Arkansas prosecutors had decided to retry all charges against Alex Blueford .
A jury had rejected capital and first-degree murder charges against him .

"Placerville, California (CNN) -- A man accused of deliberately setting a wildfire that has grown to 76,376 acres in Northern California pleaded not guilty on Friday. Wayne Allen Huntsman, 37, of Pollock Pines, California, is being held on $10 million bail in El Dorado County Jail as he faces one felony count of arson with a special allegation of a firefighter, peace officer or other emergency personnel having suffered great bodily injury in the so-called King Fire. Huntsman made his first appearance in El Dorado County Superior Court on Friday. The King Fire was burning nearly uncontrollably Friday with only 10% containment in the South Fork of the American River Canyon, Silver Creek Canyon and Rubicon Canyon north of the community of Pollock Pines, authorities said. The fire scorched the Eldorado National Forest east of Sacramento and was approaching the Tahoe National Forest, authorities said. About 4,425 personnel were assigned to fighting the fire, and about 12,000 residences and 9,000 other minor structures remained threatened, authorities said. In all, about 2,800 people were evacuated under mandatory or advisory directives, according to Cal Fire and U.S. Forest Service officials. The fire, which began Saturday, grew by 3,000 acres Thursday night, officials said. The King Fire was proving costly to fight, at $5 million a day, officials said. Exacerbating conditions were steep terrain, changing winds and the fire's speed, authorities said. CNN's Dan Simon contributed from Placerville, California. Michael Martinez wrote and reported from Los Angeles.","Wayne Allen Huntsman, 37, says he's not guilty of felony arson .

"(CNN) -- The indictment of NFL star Adrian Peterson on child abuse charges has led to a robust debate about whether hitting, spanking or any other form of corporal punishment is justified and effective in dealing with children. It has also revealed sharp differences in cultural, regional and generational attitudes toward using any kind of physical force to try to teach kids right from wrong. Peterson, through his attorney, has admitted disciplining his 4-year-old son with a switch -- taking an approach to discipline along the lines of what ""he experienced as a child growing up in East Texas,"" said the attorney, Rusty Hardin. In a written statement Monday posted on his Twitter feed, the star running back for the Minnesota Vikings touted his parents' approach as one of the reasons he has reached the professional heights he has. ""Deep in my heart I have always believed I could have been one of those kids that was lost in the streets without the discipline instilled in me by my parents and other relatives,"" he wrote. ""I have always believed that the way my parents disciplined me has a great deal to do with the success I have enjoyed as a man."" Children who are spanked or given other physical punishments like Peterson apparently was when he was a kid are more likely to spank their own kids, said Elizabeth Gershoff, an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin who has been studying corporal punishment for 15 years. ""We call that intergenerational transmission because our parents are one of our main examples of how to parent,"" said Gershoff, known as one of the leading researchers on spanking. ""So parents do what parents did to them and that's what Adrian Peterson is saying."" Gershoff, who has done a systematic analysis of the hundreds of studies exploring the effects of corporal punishment, said the research shows that spanking is more common among African Americans than among other racial and ethnic groups in the United States, including whites, Latinos and Asian Americans. ""There are people who say it might be a legacy of slavery, which is a very sad thing to think about but it's possible that having lived for centuries with a culture of violence being kind of (used) against them that they kind of keep it going unfortunately."" Parenting advocate Asadah Kirkland, author of the anti-spanking book ""Beating Black Kids,"" also points to a belief held by some African Americans that using physical force to discipline children helps to protect them from the violence of the wider world. She calls it ""The Beloved Syndrome,"" referring to a movie about slavery starring Oprah Winfrey. ""If you remember the movie, Oprah Winfrey actually kills her children because she saw the slave master coming and instead of letting him get them, she ended up killing her own children,"" she said. ""That's drastic but it comes from that mentality, but it's not real. It's a myth."" Kirkland, who gives workshops to African Americans encouraging them not to discipline with their hands, said the thinking is that if you beat your children, they will be more prepared for any potential ""beating up"" they'll face in life. ""This is not the boxing match. This is you rearing a child so that they should have certain values and certain skills that they can only have if you give (them) to them."" Former NBA star Charles Barkley added the regional component to the debate over spanking, when he suggested that a ""whipping"" is a kind of discipline that many parents in the South ""do all the time."" Jennifer Alsip, a mom of two, said she comes from a white middle class family in Texas that believes in spankings. ""I got 'whooped' and I 'whooped' my daughters (when and if they needed it),"" she said. ""All I would have to do was threaten to give them a spanking, and they would mind me."" Gershoff, the researcher on corporal punishment, said spanking rates are indeed higher in the South than in other parts of the country. Part of that, she said, may be because spanking is more common in families that have a conservative religious background. ""Those parents are more likely to say they have very strong beliefs and their interpretation of the Bible leads them to believe that spanking is a good idea, that they need to do it."" Other factors driving corporal punishment, she said, include age, education and income: Younger parents, parents with lower levels of education and parents from lower income levels are more likely to hit their children. ""Parents with less education may not be aware that there are other ways of disciplining kids,"" said Gershoff. Peterson, for his part, indicated he wasn't familiar with other parenting techniques to use when children misbehave. ""I also understand after meeting with a psychologist that there are other alternative ways of disciplining a child that may be more appropriate,"" he said. Awareness is crucial, said Gershoff, comparing spanking to seat belts and car seats. We didn't have either in the 60s and 70s when parents let their kids bounce around the backs of station wagons. ""They thought that was fine but now we know so much more about what happens in car accidents, and you can't do that anymore,"" she said. ""And I think of spanking in the same way. We know so much more now about the kinds of things that hurt kids and the kinds of things that help them that we really shouldn't spank anymore. We know it's not a good idea."" The research, according to Gershoff, is conclusive: spanking does not improve behavior, leads to aggression and other behavior problems like stealing and lying, makes it more likely children will have mental health issues such as depression and anxiety and could lead to learning problems at school. It could also lead to child abuse, she said. ""The more parents spank, the more likely they are to physically abuse their children,"" said Gershoff. ""And that's kind of what we see in the Peterson case is that people hit too long or too hard with an object and their intention is to discipline the kid but they're hurting them because they're hitting so hard."" Despite all the research we have now on spanking and other forms of corporal punishment, for parents who were spanked a lot as kids, it can be tough not to use it as a form of discipline. Micky Morrison -- a mom of two, author and founder of BabyWeightTV -- said she grew up in rural Tennessee where spanking was the norm. ""Interestingly, probably because I was spanked as a child, spanking was often my first reaction to a stressful parenting situation. It's taken a lot of reprogramming to not repeat that pattern,"" she said. Do you think spanking is an effective form of discipline?

"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- This month, CNN's Inside the Middle East explores some of the Middle East's archeological treasures. Steeped in history, the Middle East has more than its fair share of ancient treasures and UNESCO World Heritage sites. From Petra, the red-hued city carved into the rock of southern Jordan's dramatic desert to the old walled city of Shibam in Yemen and the beautifully preserved Roman ruins of Baalbek in Lebanon, Inside the Middle East chooses 10 of the region's must-visit historical sites. Baalbek, Lebanon . Known as the ""City of the Sun,"" Baalbek in the Lebanon's fertile Bekaa Valley is among the best -preserved Roman ruins in the Middle East. Built on a magnificent scale that rivaled even ancient Rome, pilgrims from across the empire flocked here to worship. Today, Baalbek hosts an annual arts festival making it a major cultural hub as well. Persepolis, Iran . Located some 70 kilometers from the modern city of Shiraz, the once mighty city of Persepolis was the capital of the Persian Empire. Founded in the 6th century B.C., Persepolis was a complex of elaborate palaces built by Darius the Great, a king of the First Persian Empire. Centuries later, although a shadow of its former glory, the site's monumental stairways and the stone terrace survive. Shibam, Yemen . Famed for its distinctive architecture, the 16th century walled city of Shibam in Yemen is often called the ""Manhattan of the desert"" for its impressive tower-like structures. The city grew up because of its location as an important caravan halt on the spice and incense route across the Southern Arabian plateau. Old Jerusalem . A holy place for Judaism, Christianity and Islam, Old Jerusalem has long held great significance. Reflecting this, the winding streets inside the ancient walled city are divided into the Jewish, Christian, Muslim and Armenian quarters. Among Old Jerusalem's many holy sites, the Dome of the Rock is probably the most recognizable: Dating back to the 7th century, it is recognized by all three religions as the site of Abraham's sacrifice. Karnak, Egypt . Karank near Luxor is a great religious temple complex full of sanctuaries, kiosks, pylons, obelisks and, notably, the Great Temple of Amun. Much of the complex is dedicated to Amun, a major god in Egyptian mythology. Karnak is the site's modern name, its ancient name was Ipet-isut or ""The most select (or sacred) of places."" Crac des Chevaliers, Syria . This crusader castle in Homs dates back to the 11th century and was first inhabited by Kurds, giving it its other name Hisn al Akrad or ""Castle of the Kurds."" It was rebuilt and occupied by the crusaders until 1270 and is now a UNESCO world heritage site. Mada'in Saleh, Saudi Arabia . This pre-Islamic archaeological site is the first UNESCO world heritage site in Saudi Arabia. The majority of the Mada'in Saleh site is a vestige of the mysterious Nabatean civilization which existed around over 1,000 years ago. The site is the kingdom's largest and southernmost settlement after Petra, its capital, situated some 500 kilometers to the north in Jordan. Troy, Turkey . First occupied by humans in the Bronze Age, Troy is one of the most famous ancient sites in the world. It is the site of the siege of Troy by the Spartan and Achaean warriors from Greece in the 13th or 12th century B.C. -- an event immortalized by Homer in the Iliad. Carthage, Tunisia . Carthage was founded by the Phoenicians in the 9th century B.C on the Gulf of Tunis and because of its strategic location developed into a great trading empire covering much of the Mediterranean. Carthage was destroyed by the Romans in 146 B.C. in the Punic wars. A new Carthage was then rebuilt on Roman designs on the ruins of the first. Babylon, Iraq .

"Washington (CNN) -- A Kansas church that attracted nationwide attention for its angry, anti-gay protests at the funerals of U.S. military members has won its appeal at the Supreme Court, an issue testing the competing constitutional rights of free speech and privacy. The justices, by an 8-1 vote, said Wednesday that members of Westboro Baptist Church had a right to promote what they call a broad-based message on public matters such as wars. The father of a fallen Marine had sued the small church, saying those protests amounted to targeted harassment and an intentional infliction of emotional distress. ""Speech is powerful. It can stir people to action, move them to tears of both joy and sorrow, and -- as it did here -- inflict great pain. On the facts before us, we cannot react to that pain by punishing the speaker,"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority. At issue was a delicate test between the privacy rights of grieving families and the free speech rights of demonstrators, however disturbing and provocative their message. Several states have attempted to impose specific limits on when and where the church members can protest. The church, led by pastor Fred Phelps, believes God is punishing the United States for ""the sin of homosexuality"" through events including soldiers' deaths. Members have traveled the country shouting at grieving families at funerals and displaying such signs as ""Thank God for dead soldiers,"" ""God blew up the troops"" and ""AIDS cures fags."" Westboro members had appeared outside the 2006 funeral for Lance Cpl. Matthew Snyder in Westminster, Maryland, outside Baltimore. Snyder's family sued the church in 2007, alleging invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress and civil conspiracy. A jury awarded the family $2.9 million in compensatory damages plus $8 million in punitive damages, which were later reduced to $5 million. The church appealed the case in 2008 to a federal appeals court, which reversed the judgments a year later, siding with the church's allegations that its First Amendment rights were violated. Albert Snyder, Matthew's father, said his son was not gay and the protesters should not have been at the funeral. ""I was just shocked that any individual could do this to another human being,"" Snyder told CNN last fall. ""I mean, it was inhuman."" In an afternoon news conference Wednesday, Snyder expressed surprise at the ruling. ""My first thought was that eight justices don't have the common sense that God gave a goat,"" he said. ""We found out today that we can no longer bury our dead in this county with dignity."" He added, ""What is this country coming to?"" Margie Phelps, a member of the Westboro clan and an attorney who argued the case before the high court, told CNN the ruling was ""10 times better than I had hoped for."" ""You can't use the subject that your feelings are hurt to trump public debate,"" she said. If that were the case, ""where would we be?"" She promised that with this ruling in hand, Westboro Baptist would conduct more such pickets. Church members say their broader message is aimed at the unspecified actions of the military and those who serve in it. They believe U.S. soldiers deserve to die because they fight for a country that tolerates homosexuality. Roberts in his opinion noted the Snyder family was not a ""captive audience"" to the protests that were conducted several hundred yards away. ""Westboro stayed well away from the memorial service,"" wrote Roberts. ""Snyder could see no more than the tops of the signs when driving to the funeral. And there is no indication that the picketing itself in any way interfered with the funeral itself."" Based on that the court concluded Snyder could not collect damages from Westboro. But the chief justice showed little sympathy for the message Westboro promotes. ""Westboro believes that America is morally flawed; many Americans might feel the same about Westboro. Westboro's funeral picketing is certainly hurtful and its contribution to public discourse may be negligible,"" he said. However, ""As a nation we have chosen a different course -- to protect even hurtful speech on public issues to ensure that we do not stifle public debate."" The ruling was a narrow one, dealing with the specific, unusual facts of this appeal. Such vocal protests at military funerals are almost entirely confined to this one small group. Roberts said on the free speech question, it was enough to rely on ""limited principles that sweep no more broadly than the appropriate context of the instant case."" Only Justice Samuel Alito dissented. He said the church's ""outrageous conduct caused petitioner great injury, and the court now compounds that injury by depriving petitioner of a judgment that acknowledges the wrong he suffered,"" he said. ""In order to have a society in which public issues can be openly and vigorously debated, it is not necessary to allow the brutalization of innocent victims like petitioner."" The Supreme Court has never addressed the specific issue of laws designed to protect the ""sanctity and dignity of memorial and funeral services,"" as well as the privacy of family and friends of the deceased. But the high court has recognized the state's interest in protecting people from unwanted protests or communications while in their homes. The justices were being asked to address how far states and private entities like cemeteries and churches can go to justify picket-free zones and the use of ""floating buffers"" to silence or restrict the speech or movements of demonstrators exercising their constitutional rights in a funeral setting. A majority of states across the nation have responded to the protests with varying levels of control over the Westboro church protesters. In Wednesday's case, 48 states and dozens of members of Congress filed an amicus brief in support of the Snyders. John Ellsworth, chairman of Military Families United, said the military protects the First Amendment rights that members of Westboro Baptist use to protest. ""Gold Star families deserve the respect of a grateful nation, not hate from a group who chooses to demonstrate during the funeral of their loved one,"" he said. ""My family has been on the receiving end of their hate and I assure all Gold Star families, this group is an anomaly and your sacrifice does not go without notice."" Church members told the court they have a duty to protest and picket at certain events, including funerals, to promote their religious message: ""That God's promise of love and heaven for those who obey him in this life is counterbalanced by God's wrath and hell for those who do not obey him."" The congregation is made up mostly of Fred Phelps and his family. The pastor has 13 children, and at least 54 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. He described himself as an ""old-time"" gospel preacher in a CNN interview in 2006, saying, ""You can't preach the Bible without preaching the hatred of God."" Church members have participated in several hundred protests across the country. In 2009, the high court blocked Missouri's effort to enforce a specific law aimed at the Westboro church. Phelps, daughter Shirley Phelps-Roper and other church members had protested near the August 2005 funeral of a soldier in St. Joseph, Missouri. State lawmakers later passed the ""Spc. Edward Lee Myers Law,"" criminalizing picketing ""in front of or about"" a funeral location or procession. The case decided Wednesday is Snyder v. Phelps (09-751).","NEW: The justices ""don't have the common sense that God gave a goat,"" the father says .

"(CNN) -- Philip Chism, the Massachusetts high school student who is accused of raping and killing his math teacher, allegedly attacked an employee at a youth services facility in Dorchester, where he is being held pending his trial, the Essex County Sheriff's Department said Tuesday. Chism was taken to Boston Medical Center, where a security detail was provided, said Maurice Pratt, the assistant superintendent and spokesman for the Sheriff's Department. ""It's an ongoing investigation,"" Pratt said of Monday's attack. ""The Department of Youth Services is working closely with law enforcement to investigate an assault that took place on a member of the staff,"" said a statement from DYS communications director Alec Loftus. ""The safety and well-being of our staff is of primary concern and a full review of this incident will be conducted to identify any necessary security enhancements at the facility,"" the statement said. The extent of the employee's injuries or what prompted the alleged attack were not provided. Chism, 15, is accused of killing his algebra teacher, Colleen Ritzer. Chism, 14 at the time, used a box cutter he'd taken to school to kill Ritzer, 24, on October 22 in a girls' bathroom at Danvers High School, police and prosecutors said. Chism pleaded not guilty to aggravated rape, robbery and murder charges in January. He is being tried as an adult. Calls to Chism's attorneys -- Susan Oker and Denise Regan -- were not immediately returned. After Chism was reported missing by his mother on the evening of October 22, police had his cellular phone company ""ping"" the location of his phone. The phone was found to be near the Hollywood Hits Theater, where investigators learned the teen had purchased a movie ticket and then left. A court affidavit said that when Chism was spotted by a police officer the next day, he was carrying a knife; a search of his backpack turned up a bloodstained box cutter. Asked where the blood came from, Chism allegedly responded: ""The girl."" He was also allegedly carrying credit cards and driver's licenses belonging to Ritzer, as well as a pair of women's underwear. Police discovered Ritzer's body in a wooded area near the school, covered with leaves and debris in an apparent attempt to conceal it, court papers said. Her throat was slit.","Philip Chism, 15, allegedly assaults youth services worker .

"(CNN) -- When Lauren Rousseau's boyfriend wakes up, he can smell her perfume. Tony Lusardi opens his eyes and holds a tiny pillow that Rousseau, a Sandy Hook Elementary School teacher, used to lay her head on. And then he sobs. He wants to touch her again. Laugh with her. ""I'm convinced that I'll see her again,"" he says. Rousseau was teaching last Friday morning when a tall thin figure wearing black fatigues and a military vest burst into her classroom. Adam Lanza, 20 years old, was armed with a Glock, a Sig Sauer and a rifle like the kind soldiers use in war. Only 30, Rousseau had told her mother before she was even in kindergarten that she wanted to grow up to be a teacher. Sandy Hook had hired her last month as a permanent substitute teacher. That was extraordinary news. Rousseau had spent so many years working different jobs and taking substitute opportunities when she could, Teresa Rousseau told a local newspaper. Lauren Rousseau, her mom said, was thrilled to finally be doing exactly what she always wanted. Remembering the victims . A natural teacher . ""I only got one year with her,"" Lusardi says. They celebrated a one-year anniversary on November 8. He's been thinking a lot about time. ""It's kinda bad to say,"" he says, sobbing, ""but I'm jealous of her friends that got more than one year with her. I only got one. ""But it was a really good year."" By every measure, Rousseau was a teacher of young children. She had that kind of special niceness about her. ""She didn't like to honk her horn at people that cut her off in traffic because she thought it would be mean,"" Lusardi says, smiling. Rousseau gave him sweet cards that had silly jokes. One had bananas on it because she was bananas about him. Teachers were heroes in the face of death . When she ran into anyone she knew she reached out and hugged them. She and Lusardi were planning to see the new movie ""The Hobbit"" Friday night, then go to a party. Rousseau had baked ""Hobbit"" cupcakes. Lusardi's Friday could have been like so many others, filled with cute texts from his girlfriend, pictures from her class. ""She loved to tell me what she was doing that week,"" he says. ""She'd send a text, Oh, we're doing this, we're doing that, and would send tons of pictures of what the kids had created that day."" It was just so easy to be with her. Their first date, a wine bar. They shared a kiss. He loved her from the start. ""The first date I had with her,"" he says. ""I knew."" Where to donate . Early gifts . She called him ""Lovie."" He called her ""Busy Bee."" During his conversation with CNN, Lusardi looks at pictures taken two months ago at a wedding. Rousseau was trying to outdo herself by making the best funny face. He thinks about the past year. It was only a year he had. It went by too fast. They never fought, he says. He wishes they would have been able to argue over what kind of rug to buy for the apartment he'd always imagined they'd share. At his home now are the wrapped Christmas presents that she gave to him. It's the kind of thing an elementary school teacher would do -- give the gifts early, let the joyful anticipation build, bring out the kid in someone else. Lusardi is broken by the thought of unwrapping them. So he hasn't. That would feel final, over. ""It doesn't seem real,"" he says. ""It doesn't seem permanent and finite."" Lusardi met President Obama when he visited Newtown Sunday. Obama hugged him. ""I want a hug from Lauren, you know, and I'm not going to get that."" Lusardi went on her Facebook page and wrote, as if he were writing to her. ""I got a hug from the President."" He would trade that experience in a second to embrace her again. He's been listening to Ingrid Michaelson's ""The Way I Am."" It reminds him of her. If you were falling, then I would catch you . You need a light, I'd find a match . 'Cause I love the way you say good morning . And you take me the way I am . If you are chilly, here take my sweater . Your head is aching, I'll make it better . 'Cause I love the way you call me baby . And you take me the way I am . ""I want the world to know that Lauren was a great person,"" he says. ""She touched the lives of everyone she ever met. ""Even if you only met her once, you liked her."" Share your tributes . Poppy Harlow and Laura Dolan reported from Newtown. Ashley Fantz wrote this story in Atlanta.","Lauren Rousseau's lifelong dream was to become a teacher .

"(CNN) -- Mohamed Ibrahim is the founder of Celtel, one of Africa's leading mobile telephone companies, with networks in 15 countries on the continent. Ibrahim was born in Sudan in 1946 and received a BSc in electrical engineering at the University of Alexandria in Egypt. After a brief stint working for the state run Sudan Telecom, he moved to the UK to continue his studying. While there he was hired by British Telecom (BT) to work as a technical director for Cellnet, its in-car telephony company. In 1989 Ibrahim left a successful career at BT to start his own telecommunications consultancy company, called MSI Cellular Investments, based in Africa and meant to be a specifically African operation. As part of his hiring and bonus scheme at MSI, Ibrahim awarded shares to his employees, which, although they were officially worthless since the company was not listed, were given a nominal value of £0.14 ($0.28) per share. When the company was acquired by Mobile Telecommunications Company KSC (MTC), the shares were sold at £14 ($27.76) each. When MTC bought Celtel, in 2005, Ibrahim sold his part in the company, for a share in the total buyout sum of $3.4 billion. Since leaving Celtel, he has founded the Mo Ibrahim Foundation which awards funding to African heads of state and governments that have demonstrated excellence in African leadership. This is a part of a $100 million fund that Ibrahim has set aside for investment in Africa, to encourage business and development in the continent. As well as his BSc in electrical engineering, Ibrahim holds an MSc in electronics and electrical engineering from the University of Bradford, and a PhD in mobile communications from the University of Birmingham.

"(CNN) -- Stephen McCullough and his partner, Brandon Hembree, lost just about everything in their second-story Joplin apartment, but they're not dwelling on that -- they're just glad to be alive. ""I thought we were going to collapse and end up on the first floor,"" McCullough said, recounting the few minutes the two of them spent huddled in the corner of their bathroom. ""I still think I'm a little in shock. I've had some tearful times."" It's hard to even fathom how someone could return to work the day after a tornado like this, but particularly for someone with a job like McCullough's: He works as a crisis counselor, helping people cope with disasters. ""[Sometimes it's] a little difficult hearing other stories,"" McCullough admitted. ""But it just feels normal to help other people, and it kind of helps me not focus on everything [at home]."" ""But you just go through it, try to breathe and focus on what you can do for them,"" he said. ""You kind of have to compartmentalize things, you know? This [here at home] is different than what I'm having to do at work."" McCullough works at Ozark Center, the area's largest behavioral health care provider, where Debbie Fitzgerald supervises crisis intervention services. She said now that the initial shock is starting to subside, more people are seeking professional help for their mental well-being. ""It's been the toughest four or five days of my entire career,"" Fitzgerald said, adding that this Wednesday, they saw four times the normal customer volume. ""Really, all anyone wants is a happy life, and right now, I don't think there are very many in Joplin."" ""Most of them are searching for a loved one or have lost everything."" Difficulty sleeping, an inability to focus or concentrate, and a lack of (or increase) in appetite are all signs that it may be time to meet with a counselor. ""The effects emotionally on even the rescue workers and those still searching are just so overwhelming for everyone, even those of us trying to help them cope,"" Fitzgerald said. Case in point: McCullough said that even he wanted the tables turned on him and asked colleagues for a debriefing session of his own. ""It's helpful. It kind of helps me refocus and get back in the game."" Ozark Center's toll-free hotline is 800-247-0661. The center prefers that customers call before visiting, but walk-ins are welcome. The building where the counselors typically work was destroyed in the tornado, so Ozark Center is operating its crisis prevention facility in Freeman Hospital's third-floor patient education room. Counseling services are free.","Stephen McCullough and his partner lost just about everything in their Joplin apartment .

"(CNN) -- Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced Sunday he was heading to Iran to join nuclear talks in Tehran involving Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The meeting in Tehran sought to reach a breakthrough in the showdown over Iran's nuclear program, according to Erdogan. The last-minute trip followed a ""signal"" from the talks, which are intended to resolve the dispute over Iran's nuclear energy program, Erdogan told reporters before departing. Erdogan indicated the signal involved Iran's agreement to swap its low-enriched uranium for nuclear fuel, CNN Turk reported. Erdogan said he hoped an agreement in Tehran would stop the U.N. Security Council from its negotiations on tougher sanctions on Iran. ""The Security Council was contemplating a step in the direction of sanctions as of yesterday,"" Erdogan said. ""As a part of our talks, this has been postponed. Now with this step we are going to take, I hope that we will have the opportunity to overcome these problems."" Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency made no mention of the nuclear issue in reporting earlier that Lula was sitting down with Ahmadinejad. But French President Nicolas Sarkozy and President Dmitry Medvedev of Russia both have said they back Lula's efforts to resolve the long-running, high-stakes stalemate. ""This could be the last chance before the U.N. Security Council makes the already known decisions,"" Medvedev said, referring to the U.N. decision on imposing sanctions against Iran. Sarkozy said earlier that he had spoken with Lula by phone to assure him that Paris supports his efforts to resolve the impasse. The United States and many other countries believe that Iran intends to develop nuclear weapons. Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. On Saturday, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu left for Tehran to join the Iran-Brazil talks. Erdogan said Sunday the anticipated signal from Iran was received and he was changing his schedule to travel to Tehran, postponing a planned visit to Azerbaijan. Erdogan's statement indicated an agreement in which Iran would send most of its low-enriched uranium to be turned into fuel rods suitable for Turkey's nuclear power reactor that makes medical isotopes. ""After our high-level meeting in Tehran, I believe we will have the opportunity to start the process regarding the swap,"" Erdogan said. ""We said that we will go to Tehran if the swap takes place in Turkey, and we received news that the text includes a reference to this. That's why we are going. Otherwise we wouldn't have gone."" Turkey and Brazil have been working on a joint offer based on the nuclear swap deal offered previously to Tehran. Both countries are temporary members of the U.N. Security Council and have been working toward a diplomatic solution that does not involve sanctions. Lula is in Iran ahead of the Group of 15 developing nations meeting in Tehran. The group actually has 17 members -- Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iran, Jamaica, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Senegal, Sri Lanka, Venezuela and Zimbabwe. Lula also met separately with Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei on his trip, according to Iranian media reports. State-run Press TV reported Khameini emphasized to Lula the need for relations between independent states such as Brazil and Iran in order to reduce the influence of superpowers such as the United States. ""The only way to change the oppressive relations in the world today is through the formation of closer ties between independent states,"" Khameini said, according to Press TV. ""Superpowers have defined vertical relations in the world which places a superpower at the top. These relations must be changed and their change is possible.""","NEW: Tayyip Erdogan says deal possible on nuclear fuel swap with Iran .

"(CNN) -- Olympic officials discounted an e-mailed threat to the upcoming Winter Games in the Russian city of Sochi on Wednesday, but the reported warning raised new concerns about security at the events. Olympic organizing committees in the United States and several European countries got an e-mailed warning of a terrorist attack against visitors to Sochi, where President Vladimir Putin's government has mounted a massive security effort to protect the events. ""The IOC takes security very seriously and passes on any credible information to the relevant security services,"" International Olympic Committee spokeswoman Sandrine Tonge told CNN. But the e-mail received by the national organizations ""contains no threat and appears to be a random message from a member of the public,"" she said. At least two countries, Slovakia and Hungary, reported receiving e-mails in English that warned about threats to their citizens and Olympic athletes. The Olympic committees for Italy and Germany also confirmed that they had received the e-mail. Others said the warnings had been forwarded to them from other countries or the IOC. The e-mail received in Hungary suggested that ""there might be a terrorist attack against nationals of Hungary and the Hungarian team, and that members of the team may be blown up,"" Zsigmond Nagy, director for international relations for Hungary's National Olympic Committee, told CNN. Nagy said the Hungarian Olympic Committee had shared the letter with the organizers of the Sochi Winter Olympics as well as the IOC. Hungary's counterterrorism agency was analyzing the e-mail, but Hungary does not intend to change its plans to attend the Games in Sochi, Nagy said. The U.S. Olympic Committee also received the message and sent it ""to the appropriate authorities,"" committee chief Scott Blackmun said. ""The safety and security of Team USA is our top priority,"" he said in a written statement. ""As is always the case, we are working with the U.S. Department of State, the local organizers and the relevant law enforcement agencies in an effort to ensure that our delegation and other Americans traveling to Sochi are safe."" Medvedev: Huge security buildup . The warnings come as Russian authorities are clamping down on suspected Islamic militants in the region surrounding Sochi, a resort city on the Black Sea coast. Russia has been battling a low-level Islamist insurgency in the North Caucasus region for more than a decade, and militants have vowed to strike at the Olympics. Among those hunted by Russian security forces are three women suspected of being ""black widows"" -- a group of women who have carried out high-profile suicide bombings after government forces killed their insurgent husbands. Police have handed out fliers with the women's names and pictures to hotels in Rostov-on-Don, a southwestern Russian town through which the Olympic Torch relay was due to pass Wednesday, and in the Sochi area. In an interview set to air Wednesday on CNN's ""Amanpour"" program, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said ""there are always some threats"" to public events, ""not only this country, but also in others."" But Russian authorities are aware of those threats and are planning accordingly, he said. ""I am referring to the mobilization, buildup, of police forces, and a huge number of policemen will watch the progress of the Games,"" Medvedev said. Over the weekend, as Putin told reporters that his government has a ""perfect understanding"" of the threat and how to stop it, a video posted online warned that insurgents had ""a present"" for Olympic visitors. 'Well-fortified' U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, told CNN's ""New Day"" show from Moscow that there were no guarantees when it comes to safety, but the security operation in Sochi ""is the most impressive and well-fortified that we've ever seen in Olympic history."" McCaul, who has been in Sochi to assess the security situation, said cooperation between U.S. and Russian security teams was good, but there was room for greater intelligence sharing. The Russians ""have been not quite as candid with us,"" he said. ""I think we could help them a great deal if they would open up information sharing more to us."" FBI agents are now going to Sochi to work with their Russian counterparts on counterterrorism efforts, McCaul said. Amid the concerns, the top U.S. military officer discussed sharing high-tech equipment to counter improvised bombs with his Russian counterpart Tuesday, a Pentagon spokesman told CNN. The matter came up ""on an exploratory level"" in a meeting between Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Russian Gen. Valery Gerasimov, said Col. Edward Thomas, a Dempsey spokesman. McCaul said President Barack Obama had also spoken with Putin about the issue. A tight security cordon is in place around Sochi, the Texas congressman said, but it's hard to be sure that no hidden threat exists. ""The problem is, how many of these 'black widows' ... came into this area before the ring of steel came up?"" he said. ""We also know that one of these black widows actually was able to penetrate the ring in the Sochi area."" Russia has deployed huge numbers of security officials, McCaul said, ""but it only takes one suicide bomber to get in to cause a real problem."" 'Eyes of the world' McCaul said it was likely that insurgents would carry out more bombings on softer targets outside Sochi, like those that hit a train station and trolley bus in the southern city of Volgograd at the end of last year. ""They know the eyes of the world are on these Olympics, and what better way to make a statement,"" he said. Besides U.S. security officers deployed through the diplomatic security service, Olympic teams themselves are also hiring private security teams, he said. ""My concern is the 10,000 to 15,000 Americans who will be at these Games and our Olympic team itself being protected from these potential suicide bombers,"" he said. ""It's very eerie when you go into Sochi to see the mountains and to think about these black widows, as they call them, who've had their spouses killed by the FSB (intelligence agency), now retaliating through suicide bombing."" However, the Olympic Village itself is ""very well fortified,"" McCaul said, and there's an impressive show of force on the ground. ""We are all very hopeful these will be safe and protected Games,"" he said. The radical extremists in the region are historically more interested in targeting Russia than the United States, he added. Giuliani: 'Tremendous security' Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who's involved in the planning for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, told ""New Day"" that it was ""too late"" to reconsider the decision to hold the Winter Olympics in Sochi. ""When you look back on it, it's awfully close to one of the worst situations in the world in terms of terrorism, exportation of terrorism,"" he said. But, at the same time, ""it happens to be in a country that has tremendous security."" Giuliani said he was familiar with the Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City, Utah, only months after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Those Games were almost canceled, he said, and had ""an enormous amount of security."" As for Sochi, Russia has ""devoted more resources to security than frankly I've ever seen,"" Giuliani said. ""In retrospect, could you have picked a place that's safer? I guess you could ... (but) the minute you hold the Olympics in a place, whether it's Salt Lake City or it's Rio de Janeiro or it's London, you have actually brought all the world's problems to you,"" he said. ""So yes, Sochi is dangerous because it's close to the Caucasus. However, the minute you have an Olympics, every one of these causes gets attracted to you and you gotta have enormous security."" CNN's Joseph Netto, Stephanie Halasz, Lucy Pawle, Matt Smith and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","An e-mailed threat to national Olympic committees isn't seen as credible, IOC says .

"(CNN) -- Three men were arrested with bombs in their possession one day after blasts ripped through the Nigerian city of Jos on Christmas Eve, a government official said Monday. ""They were heading to bomb a church when they were arrested,"" said Gyang Choji, a special advisor to the governor of Nigeria's Plateau state. He said one of the suspects is a citizen of the Republic of Chad, while the other two are Nigerian. Choji did not say the men, who were arrested in the area of Dogon Dutse, were suspects in the Christmas Eve attacks, which killed at least 31 people and wounded 74. He had previously said it was unclear who set off the blasts or whether they were related. ""The security persons are carrying out the investigations,"" Choji said. Jos lies on a faith-based fault line between Muslim-dominated northern Nigeria and the mainly Christian south. Following the blasts, angry residents and young men took to the streets where they clashed with the military. ""On the 25th, as a result of the bombing on Christmas Eve, the angry youth in Angwan Rukuba were shouting and came out on the streets and demanded that the soldiers be removed from the streets,"" said Choji. Two young men were killed by gunshots fired by soldiers and 25 people were wounded, he said. Residents of Angwan Rukuba held a press conference Sunday, condemning the soldiers responsible for the shooting. Community members are also petitioning the government to request that those responsible be brought to justice, Choji said. In recent weeks, the governor's office had received letters purported to be from some Muslim organizations threatening attacks against Christians, Choji had said previously. ""The security officials didn't take the threat letters seriously. They were thought of as gimmicks, and at the end of the day, they became reality,"" he said. The government had increased security and checkpoints throughout the past week, including additional patrols in various areas of Jos, Choji had said. In Nigeria -- Africa's most populous nation -- more than 13,500 people have died in religious or ethnic clashes since the end of military rule in 1999, the Human Rights Watch said in a report earlier this year. There have been other deadly sectarian clashes in Nigeria over the years, including one outbreak in Jos in September 2001 that left about 1,000 dead, the Human Rights Watch said.","The men were arrested on Christmas Day .

"(CNN) -- Traditionally, you wouldn't gift someone a rat -- not someone you like, anyway. And even if a gift-wrapped rodent was in the cards, you'd likely shy away from the giant African pouched rat, which -- as the name suggests -- is rather large (think cat-sized). Tanzania-based NGO Apopo, however, thinks rats make excellent gifts. So much so that they've launched an adopt-a-rat program, which allows participants to sponsor the animal. ""It's great for the giving season. It also works on Valentine's Day. Many people love to give their love, er, a rat,"" says Bart Weetjens, Apopo's founder. Despite the creatures' reputation for thieving and spreading disease, Weetjens has proven that rats can be every bit as heroic as people. Contrary to public opinion, rats can actually save lives -- Apopo's rats have actually saved thousands. From vermin to heroes . Weetjens' rodents have many talents. Mostly, though, they are highly trained to sniff out land mines and detect tuberculosis -- two scourges that have had a tremendously negative impact across the African continent. And his rats are fast. A single rat can clear 200 square feet in an hour (done manually, the same area would take 50 hours to clear). A TB-detection rat can evaluate 50 samples in eight minutes (almost a day's work for a lab technician). Though it's difficult to quantify the number of landmines buried in Africa (experts estimate the number is in the millions), there has been no shortage of casualties over the years. The Landmine Monitor estimates there have been over 18,000 landmines and explosive remnants of war (ERW) casualties in the African Union between 1999 and 2013. Aside from those fatalities, however, Weetjens notes that one of the most detrimental influences of mine fields is the amount of land they take up. ""[Affected] communities live in some kind of terror situation, where the most necessary, basic things -- like getting water and firewood or farming their land -- puts their life at peril. There doesn't even need to be landmines present. As long as there's this suspicion of landmines in these communities, there can be no real development,"" he says. In 2006, Weetjens started testing his ""hero rats,"" as he dubs them, on the mine fields in Mozambique, a country that at that time was one of the worst affected by landmines, thanks mainly to a civil war that ended in 1992. Since then, Apopo has cleared the country of 6,693 landmines, 29,934 small arms and ammunition, and 1,087 bombs. Mozambique is on track to be free of landmines by the year's end. ""It has affected Mozambique enormously,"" says Weetjens. ""The GDP has grown and there is a lot of economic development that formerly was not possible, so the effect on society is huge."" Next on Apopo's list is Angola -- the third most mine-affected country in the world. Together with Norwegian People's Aid, they hope to bring down the number of mines considerably over the next three years. TB screening . In 2005, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a TB crisis in Africa. It's a problem Weetjens realized he could address with his sniffer rats. So far, they've analyzed over 260,000 samples from health clinics in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and Maputo, Mozambique. ""Traditional methods (for testing TB) are not so reliable, in an African environment at least,"" he says. WHO agrees. In 2011, the organization warned against blood testing for TB for its inaccuracy. Weetjens notes that the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa also makes it difficult to get an accurate TB reading. ""People with HIV/AIDS tend to produce negative smears, as they have very few bacteria,"" he says. ""With scent detection, rats only need a few bacteria to be able to smell it."" The initial stages of training for the TB- and mine-detection rats are fairly similar. When the rats are still pups, they are socialized to work with people. The rats are then conditioned with clicker training, so that they associate the sound of a click with a reward (usually peanuts or bananas). They are then introduced to a target scent (TNT or positive TB samples). TB rats stay in the lab, where they are ultimately given multiple samples at one time to evaluate. The training takes about six months. Mine-detection rats are moved first to a sandbox, where they are charged with sniffing out TNT-stuffed tea balls, before they ultimately train on a test field bearing both real and deactivated mines. Those rats can be fully trained in nine months to a year. Why rats? Weetjens wanted to find a locally-sourced resolution to a local problem. ""I was looking for an appropriate solution that communities at the bottom of the pyramid could use independent from expensive foreign know-how and technology,"" he says. Weetjens notes that the advantage of using rodents is that they are cheap to train, cheaper to procure, and plentiful. Including all administrative and operating costs, each Apopo rat costs about $7,600 -- dogs can cost three times as much to train. Rats also have the advantage of being too lightweight to trip off a mine (Apopo boasts zero casualties so far). ""I kept rodents as a boy, so I knew they were very trainable, sociable and intelligent creatures,"" says Weetjens. For me, this was a natural fix.""","NGO Apopo trains rats to scent detect landmines and TB .

"(CNN) -- A small boatload of graduate students endured seasickness, hypothermia and huge swells in a 16-hour swim across the English Channel to raise money for veterans on the 65th anniversary of D-Day. A group of American students rest and warm up in between turns swimming in the English Channel. They didn't make it to the shores of France, but the physical and psychological anguish was enough to remind them of the soldiers their journey was meant to commemorate. ""I recognize that I have not done anything. Even an attempt to swim the Channel -- and a failed attempt at that -- is incomparable to the sacrifices people make on a day-to-day basis for our country,"" said Daniel Decker, a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy who is studying at Oxford University on a Marshall Scholarship from the Navy. ""At the same time, I'm happy we were able to raise some money to go toward veterans and raise awareness of the sacrifices they're making,"" he said. ""That's the best blessing I get from this -- not necessarily success for the hardship of our ordeal but the awareness raised, some recognition put toward people who really deserve it."" Decker, 22, is one of five reluctant heroes who left Dover, England, around 10 p.m. Friday, and set out over the channel's choppy waters, accompanied by friends, the captain of the Suva and a representative from the Channel Swimming Association. Collectively, they swam about 23 miles in Speedos and swim caps, slathered in petroleum jelly, against strong currents in waters that neared 55 degrees Fahrenheit. Swells reaching 6-7 feet steered them off course and knocked them against the boat at times before forcing them to turn around about 1.5 miles from their destination. ""I would have much rather touched French soil but, at the end of the day, we swam the English Channel,"" said Eric Gardiner, one of two people aboard the ship who managed to avoid vomiting. ""I felt like an ant in a toilet bowl. It was kind of humbling."" Yet the group, which consists of two Rhodes scholars and three Naval Academy graduates who will enter SEAL training after school, considers the mission a success, in terms of honoring veterans of the past and present. They raised $5,000 for The Mission Continues, a Missouri-based nonprofit that helps wounded and disabled veterans serving their communities after they return to the United States. ""We, as a group, wanted to do this to honor the inspirational veterans of the greatest generation of the past. Most of us had grandpas that fought in World War II and as a result, this historical anniversary had a special significance to all of us,"" said Scott Erwin, a Rhodes scholar and former Department of Defense employee who was injured in Iraq. ""We also wanted to do something to recognize today's inspirational veterans. We chose Mission Continues because all of us believe in its mission of attempting to allow veterans injured in combat operations to continue to serve causes great than themselves when they return to us,"" he said. The Mission Continues provides wounded and disabled veterans with paid fellowships while they pursue service and leadership roles in the community, said co-founder Eric Greitens, a Navy SEAL officer who used his combat pay to help start the organization. ""There are a lot of programs for wounded and disabled veterans designed to give them many things they need, like free backpacking trips, rental cars, access to heath care facilities,"" he said. ""But no one was giving them a challenge or an opportunity to continue their service to the country even though their wounds had cut short their military service."" Erwin and Greitens, also a former Rhodes Scholar, met after Erwin returned from Iraq. Through Erwin's experiences recovering at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, he became involved in The Mission Continues, helping to raise funds after he went to Oxford. Erwin initiated the idea of the Channel swim as a fundraiser about six months ago and recruited Decker, Gardiner, Shipley and U.S. Naval Academy graduate Joseph Hess to the cause. They trained in coastal beaches throughout the winter, but nothing could have prepared them for the experience of a midnight swim in the English Channel. ""I went in at 1 a.m. and it was completely black. You can't see anything other than the headlight of the boat and everywhere you look is complete blackness,"" said Drew Shipley, 25, another Rhodes Scholar who is working on his Ph.D. in political sociology. ""We trained well but there's no way to train for those water temperatures, plus the sensory overload of being in the middle of the English Channel in the middle of the night surrounded by darkness."" The five swimmers took hourlong turns in the water, using the intervals on the ship to return to normal body temperature before they prepared to return the open sea. After his third time out, one of the swimmers returned with the look of a ""wild animal"" in his eye, according to his teammates, and fell into violent shakes. ""We got every layer of clothing we could on him, and we had to give him bear hugs to give him some body heat,"" said Gardiner, another graduate of the Naval Academy, who is studying at Queens University in Belfast, Ireland, on a Navy Marshall Scholarship. ""He really left it all out there in the water. It was inspiring because he took it to that level."" Gardiner, 22, said it has been a dream of his to swim the Channel ever since he visited the beaches of Normandy in high school -- the same trip that inspired him to join the armed forces. ""It wasn't necessarily about glory, it was about D-Day and charity and doing it as a team,"" he said. ""Compared to what those who invaded on D-Day had to encounter when they made it to the other side, this was chump change.""","Swimmers fight rough currents, nausea in trip across English Channel .

"(CNN) -- It's like a scene out of ""The Terminator."" Rows upon rows of giant robot arms weave in and out of a tightly packed assembly line of unpainted car skeletons. There are no humans in sight -- just huge machines working in jerks and spasms, but quickly, each massive arm doing something different. Some spew sparks and fire, some brush, some drill. Others wipe or probe with their strangely shaped tips. From a second floor glass bridge inside Toyota's Motomachi plant, our tour group stares down at production lines on either side of us, noses pressed to the glass. ""Ninety-six percent of the production process is completed by robots,"" says our guide, who may or may not be a robot herself, if her monotone delivery is a hint. ""Thirty workers take care of the robots. They have an average life of 10 to 12 years."" The robots, that is. This giant factory full of giant robots produces cars for the world's best selling automaker -- Toyota sold 9.98 million vehicles in 2013. ""We need to talk about your TPS reports."" Studied at universities and schools around the world, the Toyota Production System is considered by many to be the most well-run and efficient self-correcting production system in the world . Although Toyota has been remarkably transparent about its renowned system -- opening its plants to anyone who wants to observe or study them -- emulators (automotive and beyond) have struggled to match its remarkable success. ""Many companies have focused on tangible 'artifacts' of the Toyota approach,"" says Steven Spear, senior lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of Management and co-author of the Harvard Business Review article ""Decoding the DNA of the Toyota Production System."" ""Very few have recognized and incorporated the high speed learning dynamic that is essential. The differential results between the tool-oriented imitators and the behavior-oriented emulators are profound."" The company itself officially explains its system this way: ""The practical expression of Toyota's people and customer-oriented philosophy is known as the Toyota Production System (TPS). This is not a rigid company-imposed procedure but a set of principles that have been proven in day-to-day practice over many years."" Future on display . Located two train rides and a short cab trip from Nagoya, the tour begins at the Toyota Kaikan Museum, a bland-looking building at the automaker's headquarters. While 50% of the company's 69,000 employees are located in this area, between the train station and Toyota's headquarters there's hardly anyone in sight. The building's exterior looks pure, corporate generic. Inside its glass doors, however, things get futuristic. Hologram engine displays, alien-like vehicles and Formula 1-winning cars glisten on the floor. Fascinating as they all are, one exhibit demands my attention -- a slender, blue and white robot that starts playing the trumpet. I'd heard about this robot, with its piston-powered lungs and rubber lips; I wasn't prepared for how stirring its music would be. The notes are tender, the vibrato, achingly human. If I were a musician, I think, I'd be worried about the future of my profession. Alongside the trumpet-playing robot is a scaled-down replica of the Toyota Production System, a safety simulator that works like an arcade game and a new Lexus bike. Auto pilgrims . After the museum, it's time for the Motomachi plant tour, located 15 minutes away. We're taken there, of course, on a Toyota bus. All phones and cameras are left behind in lockers. No pictures allowed. The tour is well off Japan's mainstream tourist path -- most visitors have to travel several hours out of their way to get here. There are nine people in my English-language tour group -- a mix of nationalities. All are rapt with attention throughout the tour. Henk van Brummelen, a traveler from Holland, arrived on the train from Tokyo the same morning. He tells me he once ran a chocolate factory in Holland that adopted the Toyota Production System; he's always wanted to check out the production line in person. ""It's so amazing to see how calm and easygoing the atmosphere is in spite of the incredible quality control,"" he says. Three Australian engineers who are backpacking through Japan say the Toyota stop is a priority of their trip. During the bus ride, our guide tells us a quirky fact about Toyota's name. Although the founding family's name was Toyoda, the name of the company was switched to Toyota as the latter requires eight strokes to write in Japanese, and eight is considered a lucky number. Mama . The welding factory is the site of the Terminator-like scene of robotic arms working as fire and sparks shoot over car frames. This plant produces 70,000 cars per year, or approximately 400 per day. That breaks down to a vehicle being completed every 135 seconds. More than 30,000 parts go into each car, and the plant houses 760 robots. After the welding plant, many more human workers fill the assembly line. We walk through a series of bridges above the workers, who glance up occasionally and smile at us while working on car guts. Constant ""ding dong"" sounds chime in the background, making us feel like we're in a giant video game arcade. These sounds are actually part of a ""Just in Time"" pull system. They signal that something has gone wrong or a problem has been detected and a worker has called for a supervisor. Yet the lines keep moving quickly. Another geeky fact shared by our guide: Toyota invented a ""doorless system,"" meaning they take the doors off the cars so that workers can get in and out of the car more quickly to assemble parts. The doors are re-attached later in the assembly line. At the end of the tour, we play a series of timed games meant to demonstrate the remarkable skills required of Toyota's plant workers. One involves looping ropes on pegs, and screwing and unscrewing bolts. Another feels like a less-colorful version of Hungry Hungry Hippos. The entire tour takes two and half hours. When it's time to head back to the museum and visit the gift shop, I find a large display featuring boxes of car-themed curry, of all things. I buy one, of course -- at least under factory conditions, everything Toyota produces looks incredible. Touring Toyota .

"(CNN) -- Now that the midterm elections are over, the presidential election begins. A significant number of potential candidates in both parties participated in the midterm elections, understanding that this was an important opportunity to enhance their national profile and to demonstrate what they could do for their party. The candidates are also shrewd enough to understand that the congressional environment and legislative relations with President Barack Obama will shape the political landscape for 2016. So, how did all the big players do? Hillary Clinton . The results were mixed for the former secretary of state. Without any question, the defeat of the Democrats in the Senate campaigns and the plummeting approval ratings of the President for whom she served pose a big challenge for her. The candidates she supported didn't do so well. The new Congress will offer a powerful platform for the Republican Party to keep chipping away at the President, and Obama will have trouble passing any bills that she can in turn boast about on the campaign trail. Meanwhile, the results are no doubt going to embolden some Republicans, someone such as Jeb Bush perhaps, to step into a presidential fight they might otherwise have skipped. One bit of good news for her, though, is that the Republican Congress will offer a perfect foil. Nobody has been better at using the theme of Republican extremism than Clinton, an approach she honed while first lady as a way to push back against an aggressive GOP in the 1990s. If Republicans have trouble controlling themselves as the party in power, Clinton will be in perfect position to bring back the arguments about the dangers of right-wing extremism and to remind voters that while she served in the Senate, she was able to build rather than burn bridges. Chris Christie . Speaking of bridges, the New Jersey governor received a much-needed boost from these elections. The governor has been struggling to regain his standing ever since ""Bridgegate"" ended the air of inevitability that surrounded his candidacy. Until recently, Christie was damaged goods. The pundits speculated as to whether he would survive. Yet Christie resisted the pressure to close up shop. And, most importantly, he used his position as the chairman of the Republican Governors Association to rebuild his national profile and demonstrate that he could still deliver Republican votes -- and campaign contributions. With high-profile gubernatorial victories in Wisconsin, Michigan, Florida and possibly Massachusetts, Christie comes out of the elections in much better shape. Though he suffered some losses in states such as New Hampshire, there were enough big wins to strengthen his reputation. Of course, the irony is that the victories of several high-profile Republicans, such as Scott Walker in Wisconsin, will create new problems, since that particular governor might very well run in 2016. Scott Walker . So far, Walker has survived controversy of his own, and this strong re-election win is sure to energize his supporters. He is clearly much more damaged as a candidate than a few years ago after facing a recall election. That came about from a row over curtailing the bargaining rights for public employee union members. But many Republicans are enamored with the tough-on-unions Walker, with his executive experience in a Democratic state. Martin O'Malley . The relatively unknown Democratic outgoing governor from Maryland doesn't come out of the elections in any better shape than when he started. Unlike Republican Rand Paul or Democrat Elizabeth Warren, O'Malley didn't shine on the campaign trail. Worse, in a major upset, Democrat Anthony Brown lost out in the race to succeed him to Republican Larry Logan. O'Malley's critics will be asking why he couldn't deliver. Elizabeth Warren . She continues to insist that she won't run. But the midterms were good for Sen. Warren, even if Democrats took a thumping. Warren has positioned herself as a critic of her own party, warning President Obama and others that they have not been doing enough for struggling middle class Americans. Exit polls suggesting economic concerns were front and center for much of the electorate seem to bolster her approach. The thumping Democrats suffered Tuesday night will surely prompt more soul-searching within the party and pressure for a candidate who, unlike Clinton, seems to offer fresh ideas. Ted Cruz . On the surface, the midterm results look like a great thing for Sen. Cruz. After all, he is the conservative firebrand who has spent the past year campaigning for candidates and making the case that the Republican Party is alive and well. He has been a superstar as he has shaped the conversation within the GOP. But now that Cruz is in the majority, he will also be under greater scrutiny, and his ability to govern will be tested -- until now, the senator has seemed to enjoy the role of maverick and the freedom that comes from being the party of opposition. At a time when many Republicans will see the 2014 elections as evidence that the establishment is in better shape to win than the tea party, he can also expect to start receiving push back from his own party. Marco Rubio . Rubio was once the clear frontrunner for the GOP in 2016. But his star has faded over time, not least because his party killed most efforts to pass immigration reform. Other candidates, such as Cruz and Sen. Rand Paul, also stole some of his conservative thunder. Still, as part of the Senate majority, Rubio now has an opportunity to show what he can do. With Cruz dismissed by critics as the ultraconservative Republican, Rubio has a chance to show that he can govern and form the kind of coalitions -- within his own party and maybe with centrist Democrats -- that would be attractive to voters frustrated with Washington. If he could somehow build momentum on immigration reform, Rubio could yet emerge as one of the stronger Republican candidates in the 2016 primaries. Rand Paul . If anyone doubted that Rand Paul is thinking of running for president, his intentions now should be crystal clear. Paul posted photographs on his Facebook page of Clinton campaigning with candidates who lost. And in Kentucky, Paul said in an interview that voters had rejected both Clintons and what they stood for. Paul has shaped himself into one of the more exciting voices in the GOP. But he still has many potential liabilities, including the anti-interventionist foreign policy position he has staked out, at a moment when there seem to be multiple crises demanding U.S. attention. However, he has also consistently drawn huge crowds on the campaign trail, and he has been able to position himself as a new voice in the party. This suggests he might be able to tap into the enthusiasm of tea party Republicans, while still appealing to younger voters who usually shy away from the GOP. He might also be able to appeal to mainstream Republicans looking for a candidate such as then-Sen. Barack Obama back in 2008. Being part of the majority will give him a greater opportunity to showcase his arguments. Jeb Bush . The former governor of Florida comes out of this election with a party that has momentum and feels that a presidential victory is possible in 2016. They will be searching for a candidate who can win, and for many Republicans, that person is Jeb Bush. The voting Tuesday seemed to confirm that establishment Republicans are the way forward for the party, and no one represents the establishment like Bush. Bush also continues to stick to his position on issues such as immigration that separate him from others in his party. Mitt Romney . Though he insists that he won't run, the truth is that the midterms have bolstered the notion that he should. Romney showed that he is still a valuable asset on the campaign trail, and that he can deliver on fundraising. And as the speculation about him running intensified ahead of Tuesday's vote, there was a distinct sense that he wasn't quite as set against the idea as before. The odds remain slim that he'll run, never mind win. But those odds look shorter than they did. These aren't the only potential candidates whose stock rose or fell Tuesday night. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, for one, will likely be trying to figure out what this election means for his aspirations. As will John Kasich, Ohio's Republican governor, who won re-election soundly. And that is one thing that Tuesday did not change -- the possibility that a candidate could come out of nowhere. In the meantime, even as some votes are still being counted, Democrats and Republicans across the country will be mulling over this week's election to determine whether there is enough in the results to suggest that they might be the best candidate for 2016.","Midterms have only just finished, but 2016 race has begun, Julian Zelizer says .

"Milwaukee, Wisconsin (CNN) -- President Barack Obama, in a bid to create jobs and boost economic growth, called on Congress on Monday to pass a $50 billion plan to renew the country's transportation infrastructure. His address was the first of two speeches the president is scheduled to make this week to frame his administration's ongoing response to the recession, less than two months ahead of midterm elections in which Democratic majorities in the House and Senate are in jeopardy. ""Today, I am announcing a new plan for rebuilding and modernizing America's roads, and rails and runways for the long term,"" said Obama, who spoke on Labor Day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- a state with competitive gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races. ""We used to have the best infrastructure in the world. We can have it again,"" he said to loud cheers from a crowd of union workers. The proposal envisions -- over a six year period -- rebuilding 150,000 miles of roads, 4,000 miles of rail and 150 miles of airport runways. It also would include modernizing the nation's air traffic control system in an effort to reduce delays and travel time. ""This will not only create jobs immediately. It's also going to make our economy hum over the long haul,"" said the president. Obama hopes to work with Congress to enact an up-front investment of $50 billion -- an amount a White House statement said would represent a significant chunk of new spending on infrastructure. The investment would then be paired with what the administration called a framework to improve transportation spending. The long-term plan would include the establishment of an Infrastructure Bank, which would leverage federal dollars and focus on projects that could deliver the the biggest bang for the buck, Obama said. The president stressed the need for Democrats and Republicans to work together on the transportation initiative, which would need to be approved by Congress. Congress returns from recess next week and will likely be in session for less than a month before leaving Washington for midterm elections. On Monday, before Obama's speech, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, criticized the plan and said Americans do not want to pay want higher taxes. ""A last-minute, cobbled-together stimulus bill with more than $50 billion in new tax hikes will not reverse the complete lack of confidence Americans have in Washington Democrats' ability to help this economy,"" he said in a statement. Obama is focused this week on the economy, after a week in which his administration concentrated on Middle East peace talks and the end of America's combat role in Iraq. Senior aides have said the president recently asked his economic team to come up with various proposals he could roll out to show he's working hard to kick-start growth. Ideas have included more federal spending on infrastructure projects and tax cuts popular with the business community, such as a permanent extension of the research and development tax credit. However, a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey released Friday suggests the White House still has work to do to win over the American public. Nearly six in 10 respondents disapproved of Obama's track record on the economy, which is the No. 1 issue in the minds of Americans. On Wednesday, the president is scheduled to deliver an economic speech in hard-hit Cleveland, Ohio -- a state that has competitive U.S. House and Senate races that will help determine control of Congress. CNN Senior White House Correspondent Ed Henry contributed to this report.","NEW: The plan would rebuild roads, rails and runways .

"New York (CNN) -- The administration of President Barack Obama proposed Friday a change to immigration rules meant to cut the time undocumented spouses and children of U.S. citizens are separated from their families while they seek legal status. Most immigrants living in the United States illegally who marry U.S. citizens or are children of U.S. citizens are eligible for green cards, which allow them to live and work in the country permanently. Under current law, however, they must apply for visas from their home countries while being barred re-entry for three to 10 years, depending how long they lived in the United States without documentation. Families affected by this Catch-22 can petition the government to allow them back into the United States before the time period has elapsed by asking for a waiver and proving that prolonged separation would cause a U.S. citizen to suffer extreme hardship. Under the proposed rule change, qualifying illegal immigrants could remain in the United States while they apply for that waiver and as the government decides whether to grant it. Immigrants who obtain the waiver would still be required to leave the United States to apply for a visa, but would be all but guaranteed the possibility of a quick return. The new rule could reduce separations from years to weeks or months and would represent a huge step forward in streamlining the process of obtaining waivers for undocumented immigrants married to U.S. citizens, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters. Last year, USCIS received some 23,000 waiver applications. Mayorka said that number would have been higher were it not for the current policy, which can result in indefinite and prolonged separations. ""They're unwilling to risk the extreme hardship to a U.S. citizen relative by virtue of lengthy separations,"" he said. ""We may well not see waiver applications from people who would otherwise qualify."" Mayorka stressed that the standards used to establish eligibility for a hardship waiver will not change. But, according to Ira Mehlman, with the Federation of American Immigration Reform, which seeks to reduce the number of immigrants, that doesn't make the proposal more acceptable. ""The bar re-entry rule was established as a deterrent to people violating immigration law -- that coming illegally could result in long-term denial back to the U.S. ,"" Mehlman told CNN after the proposed rule was announced. ""The administration is undermining this important deterrent."" Supporters of the rule applauded the administration's effort to cut red tape and reunite families. ""This evens the playing field,"" said David Leopold, former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. ""I think it is going to encourage people who are undocumented to come out."" The proposed change is open for public comment.","The proposal is meant to cut the time families are separated .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Boeing's 787 Dreamliner makes its first passenger flight Wednesday, carrying about 250 passengers from Tokyo to Hong Kong on Japan's All Nippon Airways. Boeing has spent years and billions of dollars developing a plane with what it calls ""visionary design."" As the first customers prepare to fly on the Dreamliner, CNN looks at what sets the 787 apart from the planes before it. 1. It's Plastic (sort of) The Dreamliner is made of 50% composite materials, carbon fiber-reinforced polymers that are both lighter and more durable than traditional aluminum. Composite materials have been used before in passenger planes but never to this extent. They comprise both the wings and the fuselage of the 787. Most of the features listed below could not have been built in an airplane made mostly of traditional aluminum. 2. The Air Inside . The cabin pressure on the 787 is higher and the humidity higher than other airplanes. Basically, passengers on board will feel like they are at an altitude of 6,000 feet, 2,000 feet lower than a standard flight. The changes will cut down on passenger fatigue, dry eyes and headaches, Boeing said. They are made possible by the new material, which is less prone to corrosion and structural fatigue than traditional aluminum. 3. More Space . Boeing's Chief Pilot Randy Neville said he believed this is the first feature passengers will notice about the new plane. You are ""not being squeezed into a tube,"" he said. ""You'll have a wide open area."" There is also more room for overhead luggage. 4. Fuel Efficiency . The 787 is 20% more fuel efficient than similarly-sized aircraft, a change which allows airlines to save money and deploy the plane on longer routes, Boeing said. ""On an aircraft of that size, even a slight reduction in fuel burn makes a big difference to overall cost,"" said Paul Sheridan, Head of Risk Advisory at Ascend. Another plus, according to aviation experts, the longer range will allow carriers to introduce more point-to-point routes, so passengers will have more options and fewer layovers. 5. Intuitive Cockpit . Neville feels Boeing has worked hard to make operating the 787 as natural as possible for pilots. ""The flight deck is laid out so it is very intuitive to operate all the controls,"" he said. One example: The Head-Up Display (HUD) used by pilots is displayed on glass, so they can see the data without having to lose sight of what's going on outside. 6. Bigger Windows . Clearly a case where bigger is bigger, the Dreamliner has windows that are 19 inches tall and 30% bigger than the on similarly-sized aircraft. Say goodbye to those plastic shades as well. The Dreamliner is the first commercial plane to have electronic dimmers at each seat. The flight attendants can also darken or lighten all the shades automatically, so never again will a small child wake up half the plane by deciding to let in a little sunlight. 7. Uniformity . Don't expect much difference from one Dreamliner to the next, Sheridan said. Boeing purposely limited the extent that carriers could customize the new plane in order to appeal to banks and leasing companies that are behind many purchases. If all the planes are similar, it's easier to hire them out to airlines or resell if needed.","Boeing 787 Dreamliner makes first passenger flight Wednesday .

"(EW.com) -- A mysterious mechanical man with the ability to write and draw holds a place of honor in ""Hugo,"" Martin Scorsese's exquisite adaptation of Brian Selznick's magical, award-winning children's book ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret."" And the author's description of the automaton's construction -- ''A cascade of perfect movements, with hundreds of brilliantly calibrated actions'' -- is an equally good way to describe Scorsese's achievement in making art that uses the most advanced of 3-D technology to sing a song of love to the movies, from the very dawn of the medium. For a lay audience, the result is a haunting, piquant melodrama about childhood dreams and yearnings, enhanced with a pleasant survey course in early film history. (It made me cry, without guilt.) For more advanced cinephiles, the result is a cabinet of wonders in which each shot, each experiment in 3-D perspective, and, indeed, each scene in the story's progression can be linked to what we already know about Scorsese, his work, and his well-known cinematic passions. A niggler might note that every element is at times an eensy bit too perfectly meshed and worked over. Today, I don't feel like niggling. Hugo is played with jolting melodramatic pathos -- and the genetic blessing of bottomless, pale blue eyes -- by Asa Butterfield (""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas""). He is a sad young orphan who keeps the clocks running in a bustling 1930s Parisian train station patrolled by a limping gendarme. (As hammed up by Sacha Baron Cohen, the character constitutes one of the movie's few tonal dissonances.) Hugo is also the patient tinkerer who works after hours in his clock-tower hideaway repairing the automaton, gear by gear. Then a bitter train-station toy-shop keeper (Ben Kingsley at his best) and his intrepid goddaughter (""Let Me In's"" ChloÃ« Grace Moretz) set the boy on a path of discovery. ""Hugo"" both ticks and flies by, a marvel meant to be pulled from the cabinet and enjoyed again and again. EW.com rating: A-- . See the full article at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- Valentino Rossi celebrated his 250th MotoGP with a memorable victory at the Australian Grand Prix Sunday -- taking full advantage after 2014 champion Marc Marquez crashed out. Yamaha's Rossi took control at Phillip Island when Marquez went off on his Honda at the Lukey Heights turn at Phillip Island with 10 laps remaining. Spain's Marquez, who wrapped up a second straight title in Japan last weekend, was looking set for his 12th win of the season. But after his error and with a substantial four second lead, he still needs one more to equal Australian Mick Doohan's all-time record from the 1997 season. ""As I had no pressure on me I tried a different approach, pushing hard from the start to try to open the largest gap possible,"" Marquez later admitted. ""We were having a good race, right up until the crash. It was a pity that I went down at a time that I was not riding on the limit or faster than the lap before."" The 35-year-old Rossi has virtually ever other MotoGP record in his possession and victory was his 82nd at motorcycling's highest level and second of the season. ""When I saw Marc crash it was a surprise, and to finish first at Phillip Island after my last victory here in 2005 is a great achievement,"" Rossi told the official MotoGP website. ""I love this track and I've won the two most important world championships of my career in 2001 and 2004. ""I won again here in 2005 but I have done a lot of podiums since then and never won."" His teammate Jorge Lorenzo of Spain took second place -- over 10 seconds adrift -- with promising young British rider Bradley Smith in third, his first podium in MotoGP. Smith's compatriot Cal Crutchlow looked set for his best finish of the season for Ducati, but he crashed out when lying second on the final lap. Crutchlow's teammate Andrea Dovizioso finished fourth. It meant a first all-Yamaha podium for the first time since the Le Mans race of 2008. Marquez's Honda teammate Dani Pedrosa was one of nine riders who either crashed out or failed to finish an incident-packed race and the Spaniard's chances of finishing second in the overall standings have diminished. Rossi's victory has given him an eight-point lead over Lorenzo in the battle for second place with two races remaining in Sepang and Valencia. Pedrosa trails by a further 18 points.","Valentino Rossi wins Australian MotoGP at Phillip Island .

"(CNN) -- A 36-year-old Atlanta woman whose body was found last month most likely died from exposure to cold, officials said Tuesday. The death of Stacey Nicole English, last seen alive shortly after Christmas, was classified an accident by the Fulton County Medical Examiner, which cited autopsy results, medical records and witness and acquaintance statements. Investigators used dental records to identify the remains found January 23 in a wooded area in southwest Atlanta. English's abandoned car was discovered in late December, with the motor running. In a statement, the office said ""the most likely cause of death is cold exposure (hypothermia) complicating underlying neurological and psychiatric disorders."" An autopsy indicated no injuries and toxicology results showed no evidence of a drug overdose. ""Because cold exposure is an external, environmental condition, the manner of death has been classified as accident,"" medical examiners said. A St. Louis man who had stayed with her December 24-26, said English was ""acting peculiar and out of character"" during the stay, adding that ""she began screaming in the apartment and shouting biblical scriptures and indicating that the world was coming to an end,"" a police report said. He said that he left around 10:30 p.m. on December 26, after English ""began asking him if he was Satan"" and told him to leave ""her residence immediately."" A friend, Michelle Strothers, told police that she last saw English on that day or the next one. In an interview with police on New Year's Eve, Strothers said that her friend ""appeared upset"" and told her ""she felt as if someone was attempting to hurt her."" Earlier, English's mother and stepfather told police that they typically talked with her ""several times a week"" and became worried after she did not answer their calls since they last talked with her on Christmas. Her mother, Cynthia Jamison, said that English ""was currently taking medication"" and had attempted suicide by overdose a little more than two years earlier, according to police. All six Fulton medical examiners participated in a peer review, the medical examiner's office said. Atlanta police later Tuesday said they were closing the case, with no further statement planned.","Police conclude investigation .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama Tuesday delivered his second back-to-school message to the nation's students -- an event marked by far less controversy than the first time around. The speech -- delivered to a thunderous round of applause from students at Julia R. Masterman Laboratory and Demonstration School in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania -- encouraged students to make the most of their educational opportunities. ""Nobody gets to write your destiny but you,"" Obama said. ""Your future is in your hands. Your life is what you make of it. And nothing -- absolutely nothing -- is beyond your reach, so long as you're willing to dream big, so long as you're willing to work hard, so long as you're willing to stay focused on your education -- there is not a single thing that any of you cannot accomplish."" The president said education ""never has been more important."" ""I'm sure there are going to be times in the months ahead when you're staying up late doing your homework or cramming for a test, or you're dragging yourself out of bed on a rainy morning and you're thinking, oh boy, I wish maybe it was a snow day,"" he said. ""Let me tell you, what you're doing is worth it. ... Nothing is going to have as great an impact on your success in life as your education."" Last year, his first as president, Obama's plan to deliver a similar message prompted an unexpected backlash from conservatives who worried he would push students to support his political agenda. However, the speech Obama delivered at a Virginia school included no political references and was welcomed by conservatives. This year's speech also focused on urging students to work hard in order to achieve their goals. ""More and more, the kinds of opportunities that are open to you are going to be determined by how far you go in school,"" Obama said. ""The farther you go in school, the farther you're going to go in life. And at a time when other countries are competing with us like never before ... your success in school is going to determine America's success in the 21st century."" He called on students to meet their responsibilities for school by showing up on time, paying attention in class, doing their homework, studying for exams and staying out of trouble. ""I wasn't always the best student when I was younger. I made my share of mistakes,"" Obama said, going on to describe a scolding from his mother about the need for more effort. ""It was pretty jolting, hearing my mother say that,"" the president said. ""But eventually, her words had their intended effect, because I got serious about my studies. I started to make an effort in everything I did. And I began to see my grades -- and my prospects -- improve. And I know that if hard work could make the difference for me, then it can make a difference for all of you."" He also urged students to take on new challenges, with specific encouragement to rebound from disappointment and failure to try again. ""So, what I want to say to every kid ... [is] that life is precious, and part of what makes it so wonderful is its diversity,"" the president said. ""We shouldn't be embarrassed by the things that make us different. We should be proud of them. Because it's the things that make us different that make us who we are."" Obama also announced a second ""commencement challenge,"" where a high school making positive changes and advancements is selected by the White House to have the president deliver its graduation speech. Obama addressed graduates from a high school in Kalamazoo, Michigan, in 2009. Some of the controversy surrounding the president's education address last year involved a proposed lesson plan created by the Education Department to accompany the speech. An initial version of the plan recommended that students draft letters to themselves discussing ""what they can do to help the president."" The letters ""would be collected and redistributed at an appropriate later date by the teacher to make students accountable to their goals,"" the plan stated. After the criticism from conservatives, the White House distributed a revised version encouraging students to write letters about how they can ""achieve their short-term and long-term education goals.""","The president urges students to make the most of their education .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Senate voted 65-31 on Saturday to repeal the ""don't ask, don't tell"" law, which bans openly gay people from serving in the armed forces. The measure now goes to President Obama to sign. The House of Representatives passed the measure 250-175 on Wednesday. Obama and the Pentagon must certify that repealing the 1993 law will not adversely affect the armed services. Obama earlier Saturday called an earlier procedural vote advancing the repeal toward a final vote a ""historic step toward ending the controversial policy."" ""It is time to close this chapter in our history,"" Obama said. Earlier Saturday, a bill that would have offered a path to citizenship to some illegal immigrants who entered the United States as children failed a procedural vote. Known formally as the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act, the DREAM Act fell five votes short of the 60 needed to be considered for final passage. Obama said Saturday that the failure of the Senate to move the DREAM Act forward was ""incredibly disappointing."" Republican Sens. Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine, Mark Kirk of Illinois, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, George Voinovich of Ohio, and Scott Brown of Massachusetts voted to advance the ""don't ask, don't tell"" repeal toward a final vote. Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, who co-sponsored the legislation that would repeal the policy, said Friday that Republican senators supporting the bill had  ""shown courage."" Lieberman said  that the bill's co-sponsors had worked closely with the Defense Department in crafting its language. But Pentagon officials are warning gay and lesbian soldiers that the current law will temporarily remain in place if the bill passes as they review the legal technicalities of the repeal. A guidance memo would be sent to military personnel informing them of the change, which would remain in effect for at least 60 days after it is signed into law, Pentagon spokesman Col. David Lapan said. Conservative Republicans have argued that, among other things, a repeal would place an unreasonable burden on the military at a time when it is facing severe strains in Afghanistan and elsewhere. The Senate is convening this weekend to finish up matters at hand before the lame-duck congressional session ends. The DREAM Act would have offered legal standing to immigrants who entered the United States illegally as children under the age of 16 and have lived in the country for at least five years. Other requirements included graduating from high school or obtaining a GED diploma and demonstrating ""good moral character."" Even then, only a six-year conditional status would be awarded. Before moving to the next phase, the students would need to meet additional requirements -- attending college or serving in the military for at least two years, and passing criminal background checks.","NEW: Senate passes 'don't ask, don't tell' repeal, 65-31 .

"(CNN) -- American Airlines, already grappling with union issues and bankruptcy fallout, is now confronting a third problem: growing reports of loose seats. On Tuesday, the company said another flight had experienced loose seats, bringing the total to three flights on two planes in a week. A plane headed from Vail, Colorado, to Dallas on September 26 had seats come loose, the airline's vice president of safety confirmed Tuesday. The same aircraft experienced a similar problem on a New York to Miami flight on Monday morning. That flight had to return to John F. Kennedy Airport. Separately, a Boeing 757 from Boston to Miami carrying 175 passengers diverted to New York on Saturday when three seats in row 12 came loose shortly after takeoff. The airline said it would inspect 47 Boeing 757 planes after the incidents. After incidents with airline seats, readers let loose . ""Originally, American planned to evaluate the seats on eight Boeing 757 airplanes, but out of an abundance of caution, the decision was made to proactively evaluate a total of 47 Boeing 757 airplanes that have the same model Main Cabin seats with a common locking mechanism,"" company spokeswoman Andrea Huguely said in a statement. ""American's internal investigation has focused on one of three types of Main Cabin seats on the 757s and how the rows of these three seats fit into the track that is used to secure the rows to the floor of the airplanes. Our maintenance and engineering teams have discovered that the root cause is a saddle clamp improperly installed on the foot of the row leg,"" she said. The clamps were used on 47 of the company's 102 Boeing 757 airplanes. So far, American Airlines has inspected at least 36 planes and found that six -- including the two involved in the recent diversions -- had seats that were not properly secured. Not all of the seats were loose, the company said, but they had the potential to become loose. Eleven aircraft could be inspected Wednesday. Huguely said the seats issue does not appear to be connected to any one work group or maintenance facility, and apologized for any inconvenience to customers. ""Safety is -- and always will be -- American's top concern,"" the spokeswoman said. The Federal Aviation Administration is looking into the incidents of loose seats, which are the latest in a string of woes for American Airlines. Earlier Tuesday, an American Airlines flight from Chicago to London made an unscheduled landing at Shannon Airport in Ireland after a passenger reported a smoky odor, an airline spokesman said. American Airlines Flight 98, a Boeing 777-200 carrying 246 passengers and 14 crew members, was diverted as a precaution, airline spokesman Ian Bradley said. An inspection revealed that the odor was coming from an overhead fan that had overheated, he said. Niall Maloney, head of operations for Shannon Airport, said such technical diversions are not uncommon. Who wants to fly American Airlines? The airline has also been beset recently by labor troubles, delays and flight cancellations. American, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection late last year, persuaded a judge to throw out its contract with the pilots union last month. Since then, the pilots have been engaging in what the airline calls a slowdown that has caused the number of flights that are delayed and canceled to skyrocket. More than 1,000 American flights have been canceled and 12,000 delayed in the past month alone. Airline management has blamed the situation on pilots filing what it claims are frivolous reports about aircraft problems. The pilots union has denied management's assertion. Late Tuesday, a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association said it would resume contract negotiations with the airline. Tom Hoban said talks could start as early as Wednesday. A company spokesman similarly said that negotiations are set to resume this week. Meanwhile, Robert Gless, deputy director of the Air Transport Division of the Transport Workers Union of America, dismissed the notion that the problems with loose seats were linked to labor issues as ""without any basis in fact."" Seat installation work is largely carried out by outside contractors, rather than maintenance personnel employed by the airline, he said in a statement. ""Problems related to seats are less likely a labor problem, but rather a management issue related to outsourcing work to third-party facilities,"" he said. American Airlines plans to increase its use of outside maintenance facilities, including in China and other overseas locations, as it seeks to exit bankruptcy, he added. Seats come loose on two American Airlines flights . CNN's Stephanie Halasz, Saskya Vandoorne, Sherri Maksin, Nick Valencia and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","The seats came loose during three flights on two planes .

"CHENGDU, China (CNN) -- Rainy weather and poor logistics thwarted efforts by relief troops who walked for hours over rock, debris and mud on Tuesday in hopes of reaching the worst-hit area of an earthquake that killed nearly 10,000 in central China, state-run media reported. Setting out from Maerkang in Sichuan Province at 8 p.m. Monday, the 100 or so troops had to travel 200 kilometers (124 miles) to go before reaching Wenchuan, the epicenter of the quake, also in the province, Xinhua reported. After seven hours, they still had 70 kilometers (43 miles) to go. ""I have seen many collapsed civilian houses, and the rocks dropped from mountains on the roadside are everywhere,"" the head of the unit, Li Zaiyuan, told Xinhua. Added CNN Correspondent John Vause: ""The roads here are terrible in the best of times ... right now they're down right atrocious. They've resorted to going in one man at a time on foot."" Nearly all the confirmed deaths were in Sichuan Province, but rescuers were hindered because roads linking it to the provincial capital, Chengdu, were damaged, Xinhua reported. Local radio quoted disaster relief officials as saying a third of the buildings in Wenchuan collapsed from the quake and another third were seriously damaged. The earthquake was powerful enough to be felt throughout most of China. Many children were buried under the rubble of their schools. The Chinese government said the death toll was sure to rise. An expert told CNN the 7.9-magnitude quake at about 2:28 p.m. Monday (6:28 a.m. GMT) was the largest the region has seen ""for over a generation."" Residents as far as Chongqing -- about 200 miles from the epicenter in Sichuan Province -- spent the night outdoors, too afraid of aftershocks to sleep indoors. Local radio in Sichuan quoted disaster relief officials as saying a third of the buildings in Wenchuan collapsed from the quake and another third were seriously damaged.  Watch as the death toll rises » . The state-run Zhongxin news agency reported that a survivor who escaped Beichuan county in Sichuan Province described the province as having been ""razed to the ground."" The Red Cross Society of China, coordinating some of the international aid efforts, encouraged financial donations because of the difficulty of getting supplies to those most in need. At least six schools collapsed to some extent in the quake or aftershocks that followed, Xinhua reported.  See a report on rescue operations at the school » . At one school, almost 900 students -- all eighth-graders and ninth-graders, according to a local villager -- were believed to be buried.  See workers in Chengdu hiding under their desks during the quake » . At least 50 bodies were pulled from the rubble by Monday night at Juyuan Middle School in Juyuan Township of Dujiangyan City, Sichuan Province, Xinhua reported. ""Some buried teenagers were struggling to free themselves from the ruins while others were calling for help. Eight excavators were working at the site. Devastated parents watched as five cranes worked at the site and an ambulance waited,"" Xinhua reported. ""A tearful mother said her son, ninth-grader Zhang Chengwei, was buried in the ruins."" Meanwhile, 2,300 people were buried in two collapsed chemical plants in Sichuan's Shifang city, and 80 tons of ammonia leaked out, Xinhua reported. Six hundred people died there. The plants were among a series of buildings that collapsed, including private homes, schools and factories. The local government has evacuated 6,000 civilians from the area and was dispatching firefighters to help at the scene, Xinhua reported. Much of the nation's transportation system shut down. Xinhua reported there were ""multiple landslides and collapses along railway lines"" near Chengdu.  Quake victims have been sleeping outside in Chengdu » . Sichuan Province sits in the Sichuan basin and is surrounded by the Himalayas to the west. The Yangtze River flows through the province and the Three Gorges Dam in the nearby Hubei Province controls flooding to the Sichuan -- though there were no reports of damage to the world's largest dam. Monday's quake was caused by the Tibetan plateau colliding with the Sichuan basin, Zhigang Peng, an earthquake expert at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia, told CNN. ""Earthquakes in this part of China are infrequent but not uncommon,"" he said. The last major earthquake in the region occurred in the northwestern margin of the Sichuan basin when a 7.5-magnitude quake killed more than 9,300 people on August 25, 1933. President Hu Jintao ordered an all-out effort to help those affected, and Premier Wen Jiabao traveled to the region to direct the rescue work, Xinhua reported. ""My fellow Chinese, facing such a severe disaster, we need calm, confidence, courage and efficient organization,"" Wen was quoted as saying. ""I believe we can certainly overcome the disaster with the public and the military working together under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the government."" Peter Sammonds, professor of geophysics at University College London, called the earthquake ""tremendous."" ""Particularly in the more remote, the more mountainous part where this has taken place, a lot of the buildings are built on sediments that are quite unstable. They're probably liquifying, causing the buildings to collapse. You might expect landslides to occur, which could actually stop the relief efforts going through on the roads, so this could be very grim in the remoter, more mountainous parts of this province."" While many of the most immediate efforts were focused on Sichuan Province, Xinhua also reported dead and injured in Gansu, Chongqing and Yunnan provinces. A provincial government spokesman said they feared more dead and injured in collapsed houses in Dujiangyan City in Wenchuan County. A driver for the seismological bureau said he saw ""rows of houses collapsed"" in Dujiangyan, Xinhua reported. Bonnie Thie, the country director of the Peace Corps, told CNN she was on a university campus in Chengdu about 60 miles from the epicenter, in the eastern part of China's Sichuan province, when the first quake hit. ""You could see the ground shaking,"" Thie told CNN. The shaking ""went on for what seemed like a very long time,"" she said. Bruce Presgrave, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey, said this quake could cause major damage because of its strength and proximity to major population centers. Also, it was relatively shallow,  and those kinds of quakes tend to do more damage near the epicenter than deeper ones, Presgrave said. An earthquake with 7.5 magnitude in the northern Chinese city of Tangshan killed 255,000 people in 1976 -- the greatest death toll from an earthquake in the last four centuries and the second greatest in recorded history, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Tangshan is roughly 995 miles (1,600 km) from Chengdu, the nearest major city to the epicenter of Monday's quake.  Read an explanation about earthquakes » . After the quake struck Monday, the ground shook as far away as Beijing, which is 950 miles (1,528 km) from the epicenter. Residents of the Chinese capital, which hosts this year's Olympic Games in August, felt a quiet, rolling sensation for about a minute.  See CNN's interview with an American in Chengdu » . Thousands of people were evacuated from Beijing buildings immediately after the earthquake. At least seven more earthquakes -- measuring between 4.0 and 6.0 magnitudes -- happened nearby over the four hours after the initial quake at at 2:28 p.m. local time, the USGS reported. A spokesman for the Beijing Olympic Committee said no Olympic venues were affected. The huge Three Gorges Dam -- roughly 400 miles east of the epicenter -- was not damaged, a spokesman said. The earthquake was also felt in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Taiwan, and as far away as Hanoi, Vietnam, and Bangkok, Thailand, according to the Hong Kong-based Mandarin-language channel Phoenix TV.

"(CNN) -- Technology is not like wine. Electronics almost never gain value after they've been sitting around for a while, but some stand the test of time better than others. As Apple is reportedly readying a third-generation iPad to be unveiled in the next month or so, owners of previous versions of the tablet may be contemplating a way to unload them for cash. Fortunate for them, the iPad can be resold for about half its original price a year or more after it hit the market, according to data from two popular online researchers that was compiled for CNN. On the other hand, Amazon.com's Kindle devices, which analysts say pose the greatest threat to Apple's dominance in tablets, have not been as sought after in the secondary market. The various Kindle e-readers generally are worth between 25% and 33% of their original price a year after their releases, according to data from electronics reseller Gazelle. After a year, the Kindle's value can sink even faster. The Kindle 3, a 2Â½-year-old product still being sold by Amazon for $139 under the name Kindle Keyboard, can be worth far less. On the secondary market, the Kindle Keyboard is worth about $16, according to data from Decide, a firm that researches electronics commerce. Amazon didn't respond to a request for comment on these statistics. Likewise, an Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. One might assume that because the iPad is more expensive than even the top-of-the-line Kindle ($499 to the Kindle Fire's $199) that Apple's tablet is likely to depreciate more quickly. But Kindles, on average, depreciate 22% faster than iPads, Gazelle executive Anthony Scarsella wrote in an e-mail. How the Kindle Fire, Amazon's first touch-screen tablet computer, will fare in the resale market is unclear. It is only 4 months old. But Amazon is expected to continue with its strategy of regularly releasing improved models at drastically reduced prices. Apple typically releases improved models at the same price as their predecessors for phones, tablets, computers and iPods, which can help previous versions retain more of their value over time. ""Kindle's frequent price drops combined with multiple models now available heavily contribute to its reduced Gazelle value,"" Scarsella wrote. ""Similar to what you see in Andriod phones (lots of model updates and frequent price drop) compared to iPhone (few models, stable pricing), the iPhone holds about 60% of its value one year after launch while even the best Androids only hold about 40%."" Indeed, another firm called Priceonomics reported similar resale-value discrepancies for the iPhone and ones that use the rival Android software from Google. However, some types of Apple gadgets are less wise investments for gear heads who like to resell their wares in exchange for newer models. Paying an extra $100 or $200 for double or triple the storage space will never result in a decent payoff later, a Decide spokesman said in a statement. Of course, pouring your money into gadgets may not be exactly the best financial strategy anyway.","One year later, an iPad is typically worth about half its original retail price, stats say .

About 60 late-stage alcoholics live at St. Anthony Residence in St. Paul, which is partly funded by the state of Minnesota, and operated by Catholic Charities. It's not a treatment center, although residents have access to counselors. They're even allowed to drink at St. Anthony -- the alcohol isn't provided, but the men are allowed to bring it to the residence. The residents receive a monthly check of $89, and most of it goes to alcohol. ""We can use that cash on anything we want to do,"" resident Ray Spoor says, matter-of-factly. ""And I don't only use it on alcohol, I use it on personal needs like toiletries ... but after that, I use it on booze."" Meet another St. Anthony resident . St. Anthony -- often called a wet house -- operates under the principle that it's safer and cheaper to have these guys drinking in a controlled environment than out on the cold Minnesota streets. ""These are all men that have been through treatment, numerous attempts,"" says St. Anthony Residence program director Bill Hockenberger. ""These are men that lost their jobs, relationships, homes due to alcohol -- all family ties pretty much have really reached rock bottom."" The men are either recommended by the county after numerous visits to detox centers, or they can apply to live there. Dr. Drew: Pointed questions on 'wet houses' Hockenberger says St. Anthony follows a harm-reduction model: It provides shelter, meals and medical attention for late-stage alcoholics, defined as those who have suffered a host of physical and psychological problems because of their drinking. ""The staff treat you with respect,"" Lott says. ""I'd be in a bad, bad position without a place like this. ... I would be running around panhandling and annoying people and maybe even stealing."" 'Harm reduction' or 'giving up'? There are at least five ""wet houses"" for chronic alcoholics in Minnesota. Catholic Charities operates two in the Twin Cities -- St. Anthony in St. Paul and the Glenwood in Minneapolis -- with the help of state funding. And there's a similar residence, called Anishinabe Wakiagun, run by the Native American community in Minneapolis. Seattle opened 1811 Eastlake, a state-subsidized residence for late-stage alcoholics, in 2005.  And other cities, including Anchorage, Alaska; Memphis, Tennessee, and Philadelphia are considering building similar housing. There was a lot of opposition in Seattle when the residence was first proposed in 1999. A legal challenge led by a prominent businessman delayed the opening of 1811 Eastlake for six years. ""A lot of the rhetoric that their attorney used was that it would be a party house, a free-for-all,"" said Nicole Macri, administrative director for Seattle's Downtown Emergency Center, which oversees the residence. ""It really has more of a feel of a convalescent home than a party house."" A University of Washington-led research team studied a group of 95 chronically homeless alcoholics and found that in one year, they cost taxpayers more than $8 million in hospitalizations, detox center treatments and incarcerations. When the same group spent one year in Seattle's Housing First program -- residences where they are allowed to drink -- the same group cost $4 million in taxpayer money, according to the study, which was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. There are other Housing First programs across the United States that emphasize providing shelter first, then treating addictions later. So far, in Memphis, there hasn't been a lot of opposition to building a residence where alcoholics can drink, city administrator Kimberly Mitchell said. The potential savings of taxpayer money is at the heart of the argument for a wet house-style residence that is part of Mayor A C Wharton's 10-year action plan to end homelessness, Mitchell said. ""What we're trying to tell them is that it's going to affect everybody -- representatives from 911, from the medical side, as well as the criminal side,"" she said. ""If you have police pick them up, then that's taxpayer dollars."" Manager: Housing chronic alcoholics makes moral, budget sense . St. Anthony Residence in St. Paul advertises itself as a ""cost-effective and compassionate housing option"" that ""costs less than $50 a night,"" compared with a night at a detox facility, which costs more than $200. But the idea of giving chronic alcoholics access to their drug of choice on the taxpayers' dime is unacceptable to most addiction counselors. It's basically giving up on a treatable disease, according to William C. Moyers, a director at Hazelden addiction treatment centers in the St. Paul-Minneapolis area. ""We feel that that it's never too late, and that even if the alcoholic doesn't want help, doesn't mean that their drinking should be condoned or in any other way enabled or facilitated,"" says Moyers, author of ""Broken: My Story of Addiction and Redemption."" ""I see the wet house model as a model that enables the addict in the alcoholic to continue those destructive patterns."" Dr. Drew Pinsky, an addiction specialist and host of HLN's ""Dr. Drew"" show, says that the idea of a residence allowing alcoholics to drink raises some concerns. ""It seems to me that these organizations sometimes use terminology that suggests this is a harm-avoidance option. But this, too, is treatment, not hospice,"" Pinsky said. ""If wet houses provide safety, comfort and some measure of respect for those with a serious illness, they may be the best choice for some."" Nick's story . After vodka ruined his career as a kitchen manager, Nick Lott found himself sleeping under a bridge -- or ""sleeping under the stars,"" as he puts it. ""[I'd] get so drunk, it didn't matter,"" he says. Then, five years ago, he made his way to the Glenwood, before moving to St. Anthony. ""My sister kind of pooh-poohed it, [she] thought, you know, 'Why would you move into a place like that when you know you have the problems that you have?' "" Nick says. ""But I think after awhile, they came to realize this was a pretty good thing. ""They would rather see me in a place like this than on the streets."" Nick had been in and out of detox centers ""at least 100"" times, sometimes just staying there for a shower and a place to sleep. He doesn't like to talk about his past, but he readily takes responsibility for his situation. ""I regret a lot of decisions that I made. I really have nobody to blame for any of my misfortunes,"" he says. ""It's because I drank and the way I drink ... If I didn't drink, I think, things could have been very different."" On April 1, the first Friday of the month, Nick gets his $89 check and cashes it. After a couple of purchases at Walmart, he spends the rest at a liquor store. ""A majority (of the $89) goes to drinking, and I know that must sound horrible to the taxpayers, but that's what it is,"" he says. ""Maybe that's all there is left for me,"" he ponders, his voice trailing. ""And it only makes you feel good for maybe a day or two, and then the money runs out or, you know, the physical and then mental things start going on ... and it just makes things worse. ""But the few moments that it does make you feel good almost seem worth it."" His routine, like that of most chronic alcoholics, revolves around his next drink. And that, he says, makes it impossible to stay connected to his siblings who live in Nebraska and Minnesota. ""I don't see them very much. To be quite honest, I kind of avoid them,"" he says. ""It's like, what do you talk about? 'Well what are you up to now, Nick?' 'Well, I live in a wet house, and I don't work. Nothing's going on with me.'"" Nick says he still has a sliver of hope that he can turn his life around, when asked if he expects to spend the rest of his life at St. Anthony: . ""Well, that just depends on how much time I have left,"" he says. ""You know, people die here all the time. ... (There's) a possibility of not spending the rest of my time here, of maybe pulling myself up and making lifestyle changes."" Less than a month after that interview, Nick Lott died at the age of 52 -- a shock to those who knew him. St. Anthony officials did not have any details about his death, and his family could not be reached for comment. His words captured the struggle that chronic alcoholics face every day: . ""It gets to where you almost feel afraid to quit drinking because it's like sometimes, it just seems like that's all there is."" CNN's Tricia Escobedo reported from Atlanta and Chris Welch reported from St. Paul.","Homeless alcoholics can drink on the premises of St. Anthony Residence in Minnesota .

"(CNN) -- The United States, the European Union and Japan are filing a challenge with the World Trade Organization against China's export restrictions on minerals that are crucial for the production of many high-tech devices, President Barack Obama announced Tuesday. In a statement to reporters at the White House, Obama said the case seeks to force China to lift export limits on certain minerals known as rare earths. China produces 97% of all rare earths, according to the European Union. The materials are used in products such as flat-screen televisions, smart phones, hybrid car batteries, wind turbines, energy-efficient lighting, electronics, cars and petroleum. ""We want our companies building those products right here in America,"" Obama said. ""But to do that, American manufacturers need to have access to rare earth materials which China supplies. Now, if China would simply let the market work on its own, we'd have no objections."" Instead, Chinese policies ""currently are preventing that from happening and they go against the very rules that China agreed to follow,"" Obama continued. What's the deal with rare earth minerals? In an earlier statement, the European Union said the challenge mounted with Washington and Tokyo ""formally requested dispute settlement consultations with China in the World Trade Organization."" However, U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said tougher steps are needed than the dispute resolution requested. ""There are faster ways to assert leverage on China than relying on the WTO, which could take years to resolve the case,"" Schumer said in a statement that called for U.S. efforts to block Chinese-funded mining projects in the United States as well as World Bank financing for Chinese mining projects. Beijing defended its approach Tuesday. ""China has worked out its own policy on managing rare earths, which is in line with WTO regulations,"" Liu Weimin, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a news conference. ""Our policies tackle not only the export of rare earth but also its production and exploration."" The United States accuses China of hoarding the valuable minerals for its own use. But China said its restrictions are motivated by environmental concerns. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters Tuesday that the issue is about uniform rules for all, rather than an effort to hurt China. ""We believe that China's rise is a good thing for the Chinese people and for the global community, a good thing for the United States,"" Carney said. ""It is also important that, as China becomes a bigger and bigger economic power, that China play by the same set of rules that other major economic powers play by."" China will have 10 days to respond to the case and must hold talks with the other parties within two months. The EU statement said the challenge to the WTO targets raw materials including 17 rare earths such as cerium, neodymium and dysprosium, as well as tungsten and molybdenum. The elements and substances are used in high-tech and ""green"" businesses, as well as in cars, machinery manufacturing, chemicals and steel. Tungsten is used in lighting technology, in electronics and in automotive, aerospace and medical technologies, the EU statement said. China produces 91% of the world's tungsten. Molybdenum is a metallic element used for filaments in light bulbs. China produces 36% of the world's molybdenum, according to the EU statement. Most of the time, rare earths cannot be substituted for without resulting in a redesigned and more costly product, the EU statement said, adding: ""Their non-availability can lead to the disruption of whole value chains."" China has gradually tightened export restrictions on the materials through raising export taxes and ""drastically reducing the export quota,"" according to the European Union. In 2010, China reduced the quota by 32% for domestic companies and 54% for foreign-invested companies. ""Because China is a top global producer for these key inputs, its harmful policies artificially increase prices for the inputs outside of China while lowering prices in China,"" said a Tuesday statement from the U.S. trade representative. ""This price dynamic creates significant advantages for China's producers when competing against U.S. producers -- both in China's market and in other markets around the world,"" said the U.S. statement. ""The improper export restraints also contribute to creating substantial pressure on U.S. and other non-Chinese downstream producers to move their operations, jobs and technologies to China."" The WTO, the body tasked with monitoring trade between nations, will be asked to be a facilitator in talks with China, an Obama administration official said Monday. ""China's restrictions on rare earths and other products violate international trade rules and must be removed,"" Karel De Gucht, EU trade commissioner, said in a statement. ""These measures hurt our producers and consumers in the EU and across the world, including manufacturers."" Despite a recent ruling in a separate dispute over different raw materials, ""China has made no attempt to remove the other export restrictions,"" he said. ""This leaves us no choice but to challenge China's export regime again to ensure fair access for our businesses to these materials."" Ron Kirk, the U.S. trade representative, said, ""America's workers and manufacturers are being hurt in both established and budding industrial sectors by these policies. China continues to make its export restraints more restrictive, resulting in massive distortions and harmful disruptions in supply chains for these materials throughout the global marketplace."" Concern in the United States over the supply of rare earths resulted in a September hearing on the matter by the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific. Of particular concern was how vital the minerals are for top-of-the-line weapons, including missile guidance systems, drones and the new F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. American companies are trying to answer the demand. Molycorp Inc., one of the few producers of rare earth minerals outside China, has urged Congress to do more to confront the problem and encourage research and development. Molycorp has mines in California and Colorado. In 2010, China temporarily halted shipments of rare earths to Japan, prompting a sharp spike in prices of the minerals. The EU said it has raised the issue repeatedly with China over the past few years without success. If no solution can be found through the consultation process, the dispute can be transmitted to a WTO panel for a ruling, the European Union said. CNN's Dan Lothian, Tom Cohen, Brianna Keilar, Jethro Mullen and Junko Ogura contributed to this report.","NEW: Chinese growth is good, but Beijing must follow the rules, the White House says .

"(CNN) -- Cosmetics are a part of the daily grooming regimen for women across the country, but now consumer advocates say your favorite lipstick or mascara may be harmful to your health. ""There's lead acetate in hair dyes, lead in lipsticks, formaldehyde and 1, 4-dioxane in baby shampoos and other shampoos,"" said Lisa Archer, co-founder and former director of the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics and current director for the environmental group Friends of the Earth. Health-care giant Johnson & Johnson pledged in August of 2012 to remove trace amounts of carcinogens and other potentially toxic chemicals from its toiletries and cosmetics by the year 2015. The company had previously pledged to remove such ingredients in baby products by the end of 2012. According to the federal laws enforced by the Food and Drug Administration, cosmetics companies are responsible for ensuring the safety of their products. Unless there is a color additive, the FDA does not require ingredients in beauty aids to be approved before going on the market. Regulation dates back to 1938 and has seen minor changes over the years. The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics is working with U.S. representatives to support the Safe Cosmetics Act of 2011. The organization was also a driving force behind Johnson & Johnson's monumental announcement. In a statement to CNN, Johnson & Johnson said, ""Nothing is more important to us than the peace of mind of people using our products, that's why on August 15th, we made a global commitment to remove a number of commonly used ingredients from our baby and beauty consumer products."" The company created a website where consumers can view its policies and procedures on its ingredients and safety measures. Johnson & Johnson also stated that despite the change, the company believes the products it currently sells are safe. ""What matters most isn't what we think. It's what our customers think. That's why we decided to take the unprecedented step of removing or reducing ingredients that, at their present levels, are safe by scientific standards and considered safe by key regulators around the world, including the EU, the U.S. and China,"" said the company in its statement to CNN. Archer disagrees. ""It's really important for consumers to know that small doses can add up to harm and the timing of the dose of the toxic chemicals really matters as well,"" she said. The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics' website offers resources for consumers to research what is in their products. The site also lists what the organization calls ""chemicals of concern."" For Nakia Evans, an Atlanta medical assistant who has suffered with breakouts and skin irritation for years, the discovery was an epiphany. ""We want to look great on the outside, but we also have to educate ourselves when we're applying makeup about what we're doing not only to our skin, but internally,"" she said. Evans has since discovered natural and organic skin care products such as LAMIK Beauty. ""We are paraben free, we are talc free and we are free of those things because we feel that you should not have to sacrifice your health for beauty,"" said Kim Roxie, creative director of LAMIK Beauty. In 2010, the company was a finalist for HBA Global's International Package Design Awards for its green packaging. HBA Global is a product development source for the beauty and personal care industry. ""It's really about educating the consumer and making them more aware,"" Roxie said. Meanwhile, Evans said her new discovery means a new way of thinking for her and no more breakouts. ""It actually helped my skin, so I would recommend that you research what you're putting on your skin,"" she said. Archer said she hopes other multinational companies follow Johnson & Johnson's lead by removing the potentially toxic chemicals from their products, but she also advises consumers to continue to do their homework. ""We encourage buyers to beware and do your research,"" she said. ""Because it's the wild wild West and nobody is actually monitoring that aisle in the store.""","The FDA doesn't have to approve most beauty aids before they go on the market .

"(CNN) -- Six former top Bosnian Croat leaders were handed long prison sentences Wednesday after they were convicted of crimes against humanity and war crimes, including the rape and murder of Bosnian Muslims. The offenses, which date to between 1992 and 1994, formed part of a wider conflict that followed the break-up of the former Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. Christiane Amanpour: Bosnia's lesson for Syrian slaughter . The six were accused at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia of trying to ""ethnically cleanse"" non-Croats from areas of the territory of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Bosnian Croat leadership, along with Croat leaders, wanted to make this territory part of a ""Greater Croatia,"" said the ICTY, which is based in the Hague. In order to achieve this, they carried out crimes against Bosnian Muslims and other non-Croats that included murder, rape, sexual assault, destruction of property, imprisonment and deportation, the ICTY statement said. Jadranko Prlic, Bruno Stojic, Milivoj Petkovic and Valentin Coric were convicted on 22 counts of the indictment for war crimes and crimes against humanity. In photos: Remembering the Bosnian war . Prlic, the former president of the Croatian Defense Council and later head of the government of a wartime Croat entity, Herceg-Bosna, was sentenced to 25 years in prison -- the toughest penalty. The other three were given prison terms ranging from 16 to 20 years in length. Two of the accused, Slobodan Praljak and Berislav Pusic, were acquitted on some of the charges against them. Praljak, a former assistant defense minister of Croatia and at the same time a commander of the Croatian Defense Council, was convicted on 20 counts and sentenced to 20 years in prison. He played an important role in securing weapons and ammunition for the Croatian Defense Council army, the indictment said. Pusic, who was formerly in charge of detention facilities and prisoner exchanges for the Croatian Defense Council, was found guilty on 18 counts and given 10 years in prison. Defense lawyers for the six have 30 days to appeal their convictions and sentences. 'Extreme violence' The chamber ruled by a majority that the accused wanted to create a Croat entity to unify the Croatian people in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Later, these areas were to be either joined with the Republic of Croatia or remain in close association with it, the ICTY said. The indictment focused on crimes committed in eight municipalities, including Mostar, the ICTY said. The chamber concluded that ""in the majority of cases, these crimes were not committed in a random manner by a few undisciplined soldiers. On the contrary, they were the result of a plan put together by the (accused) members to remove the Muslim population of Herceg-Bosna."" Others were also part of this joint criminal enterprise, it said, and together they secured personnel and coordinated operations on the ground to carry out the plan. In the case of the historic city of Mostar, ""extreme violence"" was used to evict Bosnian Muslims from West Mostar, claimed by the Croats, to the other side of the city, the statement said. ""Muslims were woken up in the middle of the night, beaten and forced to leave their apartments, often still in their pyjamas. Many women, including a girl of 16, were raped"" by Croatian Defense Council soldiers, it said. From June 1993 to April 1994, East Mostar was under siege and the Muslim population there was subject to ""intensive and constant"" shelling which left many civilians dead or injured, it said. Other testimony focused on abuses against Muslim prisoners at Croatian Defense Council detention centers, including beatings, sexual assaults and using them as forced labor on the front lines. The trial, which started in April 2006, is one the largest and most complex the tribunal has handled, it said. More than 200 witnesses were called, 145 of them by the prosecution, and the judgment runs to some 2,600 pages. CNN's Marilia Brocchetto contributed to this report.","Six former Bosnian Croat leaders are sent to prison for war crimes and crimes against humanity .

"(CNN) -- Melissa McCarthy is one of the hottest actresses in Hollywood right now, so it's no wonder that Elle magazine named her one of their top 2013 ""Women in Hollywood,"" and even put the plus-size comedian on the cover. However, some critics are crying foul at the cover shot, decrying it as fat-shaming. In an article for Slate.com, writer June Thomas laments, ""McCarthy's hair covers a quarter of her gorgeous face, and with her hands stuffed deep into her coat pockets, the only visible flesh is a tiny triangle between the coat's lapels and the briefest glimpse of calf."" Why Elle magazine got McCarthy right . McCarthy is seen wearing a large green coat that covers nearly her entire body, with unruly hair that also covers a portion of her face. In contrast, other actresses who had their own covers, such as Reese Witherspoon, showed off their bodies in figure-hugging outfits. People on Twitter expressed their outrage and disappointment: ""#Elle Put Melissa McCarthy In A Big Coat To Hide Her Body - The coat is gorge, but the difference in shots is sad,"" tweeted Curvy Exchange, a community that buys and sells plus-sized fashion. Elle responded to the controversy by releasing a statement about the November issue: ""On all of our shoots, our stylists work with the stars to choose pieces they feel good in, and this is no different,"" a spokesperson for the magazine said.

"New York (CNN) -- The report into Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 says everything. And yet it says nothing about the cause of the plane's crash and the criminals. It tells us that MH17 was brought down by ""high energy objects"" which were of ""external causes"" and never once uses the word missile. How can this be? The purpose of the preliminary report is not to apportion blame; that is left to prosecutors and courts who deal with those who caused this atrocity. This investigation is all about finding out what happened and making sure it never happens again. Once you understand that, reading the report makes sense. There is a great deal about how the plane got to be flying where it was, how engine oil was added in Amsterdam airport before MH17 flew into Ukraine and some thundershowers. The report details how the plane was flying legally, over eastern Ukraine and in unrestricted air space. That point is made again and again, lest anyone wants to suggest otherwise. The reports goes into the routine progression of the flight. How the pilots asked for a slight change of course to the left to avoid bad weather, then air traffic control re-directed them to avoid other planes in the area. Indeed, the report makes clear that there were three other large commercial planes in the area, two 777s and an A330. MH17 was the victim of the awfulness of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Hauntingly, when you read the transcript of the air traffic control communications, there were no warnings, no maydays, nothing. The plane just disintegrated after being hit by those ""high energy objects."" It is left to the air traffic controller in Russia, who comments minutes after the incident, that it seemed as if the radar signature ""started falling apart."" Other air traffic controllers say ""it's disappeared."" I have read many air traffic accident reports. In this report they have to make clear that the so-called black box's unique digital signature was correct for this aircraft. In other words, this was the right flight data recorder for that aircraft. The report made clear it had been neither switched nor tampered with. This report is stark because it shows just how normal everything was until the second when the ""external causes"" hit. There is no long discussion about performance of engines, as they start to go wrong, no analysis of pilots actions as complex avionics start to flash warnings. Just the sad, awful fact that at 13:20 the plane was blasted out of the sky. And it never says the word missile. READ MORE: What I saw at the MH17 crash site . READ MORE: Bitter lessons of MH17 .

"(CNN) -- As both President Obama and Mitt Romney make the case for creating jobs, they are ignoring one of the fastest-growing job creators in our economy: the nonprofit sector. The only mention of nonprofits on the campaign trail or in the debates has been whether to limit tax deductions for charitable donations. For the sake of our economy, the health and continuous growth of this sector should be a priority for the next president. The size and scope of the nonprofit sector may come as a surprise. There are almost 1.5 million nonprofit organizations in the country, including well-known brands like the Girl Scouts, Habitat for Humanity, United Way and the YMCA, as well as many smaller and more community-based service organizations, schools, congregations, sports leagues and hospitals. Taken all together, the sector generates almost $1.5 trillion in spending per year and employs about one in 10 American workers, or 13.5 million people. It is the third largest labor force behind retail trade and manufacturing. If your son or daughter is considering a career in nonprofits, don't be alarmed. While nonprofits are known for employing social workers, they also need managers, human resource professionals, educators, artists, computer programmers, marketers, accountants, athletes, carpenters, researchers, cooks and many other skilled workers. And as one of the fastest-growing job sectors over the past decade, nonprofits offer plenty of good jobs. According to a study by Lester Salamon of Johns Hopkins University, ""the U.S. nonprofit sector posted a remarkable 10 year record of job growth despite two recessions, achieving an annual growth rate of 2.1% from 2000 to 2010."" In comparison, for-profit jobs declined by 0.6% per year during the same period. The study continues, ""Even during the recession from 2007 to 2009, nonprofit jobs increased by an average of 1.9% per year. At the same time, businesses averaged jobs losses of 3.7% per year."" There are several reasons that account for the growth. In a time of economic challenges, nonprofits have grown to meet the greater needs in our communities. Many services previously provided by the government are now contracted to nonprofits. Changing demographics, especially the aging of America, has increased demand for services. The sector has also experienced a wave of entrepreneurship and innovations, along with adoptions of best practices from businesses, that have increased its effectiveness and size. One might question whether jobs created in the nonprofit sector are really private-sector jobs, since many of the jobs are subsidized by the government through tax-deductible donations and direct grant support. But the truth is that many private-sector businesses receive tax credits, tax deductions, government grants and government contracts. No one dismisses as private-sector jobs those at Lockheed Martin, which received $16 billion in government contracts from 2009 to 2011. Or General Electric, which paid no federal taxes last year. When there are proposals to cut defense or other federal programs that fund businesses, Congress often protects them because those cuts kill private-sector jobs. Shouldn't Congress likewise protect cuts in federal funds that eliminate middle-class jobs that provide health, education, opportunity, safety and culture for our communities? Here are some things the next president can do to support a growing nonprofit sector: . 1. Maintain the charitable tax deduction and the estate tax. Restricting the flow of private resources into the nonprofit sector will affect its opportunity to create and sustain jobs and impact. Charitable giving overall is essential to our communities, democracy and economy. But there is still a need to explore how to drive more giving toward greater problems like poverty rather than university endowments. 2. Provide student loan forgiveness and incentives for veterans. Most nonprofits are not able to invest in training and development, so young employees bear those costs. Allowing student loan forgiveness for those who devote their lives to service and allowing a new GI Bill to invest in returning veterans who want to serve their communities at home would make a great difference. 3. Expand national service. With 87,000 people serving in AmeriCorps nationally, this public-private partnership has become a critical human capital source for the nonprofit sector. Both presidential candidates have been champions of service, and whoever wins should implement the bipartisan Serve America Act to grow AmeriCorps to 250,000 people. 4. Invest in social entrepreneurship. Expand the federal social innovation fund and new sources of financing, such as social impact bonds, so that investments can go into helping organizations and programs that show evidence of success. 5. Open federal investments in small businesses and jobs to nonprofits. Nonprofits are not able to access the same incentives as businesses to grow and train their work forces. If nonprofits could receive tax credits, they could sell in a secondary market to businesses to grow more jobs. In addition, the Small Business Administration and other federal programs that support jobs could open opportunities to nonprofits. Investing in the nonprofit work force is a double win because it would create good jobs and improve our quality of life through mission-driven goals. The nonprofit sector should be a central part of any discussions about our economic recovery strategy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Schmitz.","Paul Schmitz: President Obama and Mitt Romney are ignoring the nonprofit sector .

"(CNN) -- Valuable insight into our health is lurking beneath our city streets. ""We can reveal the invisible in a city. The underworld we don't see every day,"" says architect Carlo Ratti. The underworld Ratti is referring to is our sewers -- home to the most personalized waste a city has to offer. As director of the Senseable City Lab at MIT, his ""Underworlds"" project is using this waste to open up a new world of information on human health and behavior through a platform he calls ""Smart Sewage."" ""New techniques in biology allow us to characterize bacteria and viruses leaving our bodies. [This is] the microbiome of us,"" explains Ratti. His team is currently designing prototype smart platforms that collect sewage, filter it and use computational techniques to analyze any genetic material present to identify any viruses and bacteria, as well as spotting specific chemicals using a technique known as mass spectrometry. Ratti aims to characterize a city's microbiome (the vast community of microbes that lives in the human body) and ultimately ""see epidemics before they happen."" Detecting infections . The main benefits lie in the real-time aspect of the technology, providing insight into the diseases circulating in a community before the people affected know for themselves. ""The steps involved in disease diagnosis are slow,"" Ratti explains. First, people need to notice symptoms of illness, and then they have to begin the process of doctors' appointments and tests to get a diagnosis. Testing sewage could be a faster way to predict the presence of infections among the population. To begin with, the project will primarily look for influenza and gastroenteritis-related outbreaks, such as salmonella and rotavirus infections, but the potential public health benefits go beyond outbreak prediction and surveillance. ""Most of what's going in and out of a city is the water going in and sewage coming out,"" says Eric Alm, professor of Biological Engineering and Civil and Environmental Engineering at MIT, who runs the Underworlds project alongside Ratti. ""The change in water in and out reflects a broad array of human activity going on in a city,"" he adds. But Alm admits there are many challenges ahead and that it's not as straightforward as getting DNA from the sewage and sequencing it. ""It's only useful if we can figure out what kind of sewage water it is,"" he says. The water in our sewers is a mix of water from showers, toilets and rain, and the resulting chemicals and microorganisms will vary depending on the source. ""The second challenge is, who has contributed to that water?"" explains Alm. But he believes his team can build a robust platform to not only monitor changes in health, but also see what chemicals are being released into the water by industries, as well as monitor chemical security threats and even assess the impact of health policies by looking at other biological factors. ""There's a whole host of applications we can use,"" says Alm. Live trials . The first city to trial their prototype will be the one local to MIT -- Boston. This will be piloted in 2016, ready for a bigger prototype set to be implemented in Kuwait City the following year, where the team has formed a partnership with Kuwaiti stakeholders including its Ministry of Health. Trials are essential to understand the true sensitivity of such a technology and the extent to which microorganisms such as viruses can be detected. ""It's a clever idea in principle,"" says Sandy Cairncross, professor of Environmental Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. But he remains unsure whether the bacteria and viruses being targeted can be easily found. ""Some organisms are more fragile than others and will die in the sewers, some are difficult to detect in small numbers and some are more numerous than others,"" he says. Cairncross recalls a cholera study that took swabs of sewage from manholes in Dhaka, Bangladesh, but failed to find a single one these bacteria. ""It has potential but will take a lot of trial and error to find which results are reliable or meaningful,"" he adds. The concerns are shared by the team at MIT. ""We need to figure out how far down from somebody's home or business you can still see organisms,"" explains Alm, who also suggests they may need to time sampling to ""peak poop hours"" during the day, such as the morning. But they have had some success. ""We did some early studies last year and detected some flu viruses, which we were very excited about."" Their sewage success was indeed exciting as the types of organisms expected to be found are those associated with the gastrointestinal tract, such as salmonella, whereas flu viruses are respiratory. ""I'm optimistic,"" says Alm. Smart toilet . Whilst the short-term plan is to use this technology platform to collect information about entire populations, in the future it could become more personalized, via a smart toilet. ""We will be able to monitor the microbiome individually, and tell you about your body,"" says Ratti about the overall vision for the technology, ""to monitor and detect this before you fall sick."" Alm monitored his own microbiome for a year back in 2009, which involved noting every food item consumed and analyzing his every bowel movement. But the arduous task provided detailed insight into the microbial communities living inside his body and the impact any changes in travel, diet or health had on their composition. The smart toilets are likely to begin simple, with a device to drop into a toilet rather than a toilet you buy outright with technology installed. But the information provided could add to the growing field of personalized medicine and healthcare. The immediate future, however, remains the glamorous task of mining sewage to visualize urban health patterns. ""Sewage is the most logical start point,"" concludes Alm about his goals to find the bugs infecting a city. ""You never know until you go out and find it.""","""Underworlds"" project will analyze sewage to spot diseases .
Monitoring city sewage could reveal infections circulating in the population .
The project could one day be applied to create individual ""smart toilets"""
"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama isn't giving Republicans time to catch their breath after celebrating an election triumph. He barnstormed into action following Tuesday's midterm elections, pushing his priorities before Republican leaders can frame their agenda for the new Congress, which convenes in January. Obama challenged congressional leaders he met with over lunch Friday to back his expanding war against ISIS. The President plans to send up to 1,500 more troops to train Iraqi and Kurdish forces while asking Congress for another $5.6 billion to fund the operation. On another front for the busy White House, Obama on Saturday named U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch to succeed outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder. The move put Senate Republican leaders -- whose aides said they were not informed ahead of time -- on the defensive. In a volley of news releases they insisted that her confirmation should be put off until the majority-GOP Senate convenes in January. Obama is also pressing lawmakers to approve $6 billion in emergency funding to fight Ebola before they leave Washington for the holidays. And the President will head to Asia this weekend to show his authority on the world stage has not been splintered by pending GOP domination of Congress. The President is operating from a playbook by his chief of staff, Denis McDonough, that's been weeks in the making; it takes him through the lame duck session of Congress and his penultimate State of the Union address in January. One of his next moves, aides say, will be to use his executive power to reshape the nation's immigration system before the end of the year, despite Republican claims he will ""poison the well"" for future cooperation. But Obama's time to wield the initiative will be brief. Come next year, he will be hit with a blizzard of bills from the new Republican Congress, including efforts to dismember his signature health care law and policies on climate change. As the President fights the dreaded perception he is a lame duck, his strategy can be summed up in three words — show no weakness. He is making a clear attempt not to appear morose after an election seen as a repudiation of his administration. Reporters at a post-election news conference sought to goad Obama into admitting culpability for the Democratic meltdown, but he avoided prolonging the story by giving the election defeat a catchy term similar to ""shellacking"" -- the word he used in 2010. Instead he vowed to play the ""fourth quarter"" of his presidency well. The approach is designed to maximize Obama's remaining political capital in Washington, which will quickly dry up once the 2016 presidential campaign fires up. Obama will also deny pundits the political firing squad they are demanding, and has no plans for a big staff shakeup. Even before Tuesday's election, critics had demanded fresh blood in a White House that critics see as sealed off from political reality. But aides say the kind of shakeup that helped invigorate other late-term presidencies is not Obama's style. Even now, he is still surrounded by many aides from his 2008 campaign. ""What I am ruling out ... would be sort of a large-scale public firing,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Thursday. Still, many aides are worn down by the brutal demands of a punishing presidency weighed down by crisis after crisis at home and abroad — so there will be some natural turnover with two years to go. But there are no signs Obama will make huge changes in the West Wing or to his Cabinet — along the lines of President George W. Bush's dismissal of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld after the 2006 midterms, when control of Congress flipped to the Democrats. ""There will be some people leaving, but I don't think there will be a huge shakeup,"" said one White House official. One difference from 2006 is that the outspoken Rumsfeld was closely associated with a war that had gone bad — in Iraq, which was the prominent issue in an election Bush referred to as a ""thumping."" Ditching Rumsfeld allowed Bush to reengineer war strategy with his troop surge, which staved off a humiliating defeat in Iraq. But other than Obama himself, there is no obvious official who encapsulates the failings of this administration, so a satisfying ""clearing out"" might impress Beltway insiders but achieve little. Staff changes that do take place will likely come after the president has recharged his batteries and reflected on the way forward during his annual December vacation in Hawaii, an official and a former administration official said. But the big names are staying. National Security Adviser Susan Rice, who earned some rough reviews on Capitol Hill and among some U.S. allies for her sometimes brusque manner, said Friday she was going nowhere. ""I serve at the pleasure of the President and I will continue to serve as long as he'd like me to,"" said Rice. No one expects Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to leave yet, despite whispers about his performance in Washington. The biggest personnel change -- and one of the few that will resonate outside the Washington area code, may be the one involving Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken, whom Obama nominated Friday as deputy secretary of state. The Washington Post reported Friday that former U.S. Under-secretary of State Nicholas Burns is the choice of some administration hands to inject new foreign policy bandwidth into the administration. But Obama's inner circle is notoriously tough to penetrate, a factor that might put off some potential newcomers. Those mulling their futures include one of Obama's longest-serving aides, senior policy adviser Dan Pfeiffer, a 2008 campaign alumnus, who had several health scares last year. West Wing staffers are not expecting McDonough to leave. But senior adviser John Podesta's self-imposed one-year term limit at the White House is almost up. He is tipped to join Hillary Clinton's yet-to-launched presidential campaign. Ebola czar Ron Klain, meanwhile, is likely in line for a more permanent West Wing policy job. Deputy communications director Jennifer Palmieri is also said to be considering her future, while Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes has not yet made his intentions public. Many people had expected David Plouffe, Obama's campaign guru, to return to a White House role after the election. But Plouffe is now steering online smartphone taxi service Uber as senior vice president.","President Barack Obama has a fast start after election debacle .
Moving quickly: More military advisers for Iraq, AG nomination, Ebola funding request .
Big staff shake-ups have not been Obama's style, and that's unlikely to happen ."
"(CNN) -- Starting next year, Cubans traveling abroad will face fewer hurdles leaving the country. The official news site Granma reported Tuesday that the Cuban government will no longer require a travel permit and a letter of invitation. Until now, Cubans had to pay $150 for an exit visa. A resident in the country that the Cuban wanted to visit would also have to write a letter of invitation. Read more: Raft with Cuban refugees sinks near Cancun . Fees associated with the letter ran as high as $200. That's a steep price in a country where the average official monthly income is about $20. Even with the two documents, a traveler could run up against a wall if the government denied an exit visa -- as it has done with many dissidents. Medical professionals are only allowed to leave Cuba to work for the government abroad. But once the new requirements go into effect on January 14, travelers will only have to present a valid passport and an entry visa for the country where they are headed. The move is part of the reforms that President Raul Castro promised when he took office in 2008. Read more: Cuban Missile Crisis ground zero, 50 years on . At the time, he pledged to do away with unnecessary restrictions. And that year, he lifted prohibitions on Cubans staying in hotels and buying mobile phones. The new change, however, does not mean that anyone wanting to travel will get a passport. ""The ordinary passport will be issued to the Cuban citizens who meet the requirements of the Migration Law,"" which is being modified, according to the report in Granma. While the report does not say how the law will be altered, it does add that the government will fight brain -- and money -- drain ""from the aggressive and subversive plans of the US government and its allies."" It will do so by leaving in place measures to preserve ""human capital created by the Revolution from the theft of talents practiced by the powerful nations.""

"(CNN) -- An operation to airlift thousands of African migrants stranded in violence-ravaged Central African Republic in dire humanitarian conditions started Saturday. The move comes a day after the country's interim leaders, President Michel Djotodia and Prime Minister Nicolas Tiangaye, who took power after a coup last year, announced their resignation at a regional summit in Chad. The airlift, on a specially chartered plane, has been set up by the International Organization for Migration in response to the urgent need for tens of thousands of migrants to flee the country. Francois Goemans, emergency coordinator for the IOM operation, said the first flight to leave the Central African Republic's capital, Bangui, on Saturday afternoon would ferry between 300 and 320 Chadians to their capital, Ndjamena. READ MORE: Children beheaded as violence grows . Two more flights to Ndjamena will follow, taking a total of 1,000 Chadian migrants home. Priority has been given to families, especially women and children, the IOM official said. Goemans said he was shocked by the conditions endured by the migrants, which he said were the worst he had seen in 20 years in the field. People have been living in makeshift transit camps for a couple of weeks in difficult conditions and with very little support, he said. ""The situation is terrible,"" he said. ""There's diarrhea, the sanitation is terrible. ""People are traumatized, people are dealing with some strains that you cannot believe -- so many of their relatives have been killed ... and they are all traumatized."" Foreigners 'target of violence' Medical checks are under way to make sure the migrants are fit to travel, Goemans said. The three charter flights to Chad will be followed by two to Bamako in Mali, he said. About 700 Malians will be taken back to their home country by Tuesday, he said. In the past couple of weeks, the IOM has helped other African nations including Mali, Senegal and Burkino Fas, to evacuate thousands of their citizens. It has now stepped in with its own charter flights so that those stranded in desperate need don't have to wait any longer or travel on cargo planes without seats, Goemans said. The organization is also working with governments across the region to help their nationals who've been brought home, some of them destitute, to resettle, he said. Many will need psychological and social support to help them recover from their experience, he said, not least because foreigners have often been the target of the violence currently tearing the Central African Republic apart. The operation to fly out all the migrants stranded in the country will likely take several weeks. Many are outside the capital, Goemans said, making movement dangerous and access difficult. Plunged into chaos . While nearly 27,000 migrants from neighboring countries have been evacuated by their countries, at least 33,000 more who've asked for help from their embassies remain in urgent need of aid, the IOM said Friday. ""The evacuation of these migrants must be done quickly and in an orderly manner to avoid people trying to leave on their own overland and taking terrible risks, in desperation,"" said IOM West Africa director Carmela Godeau. The Central African Republic was plunged into chaos last year after a coalition of rebels dubbed Seleka ousted President Francois Bozize, the latest in a series of coups since it gained independence. Rebels infiltrated the capital in March, sending Bozize fleeing to Cameroon. Djotodia, one of the Seleka leaders, then became interim President. Since then, political turmoil and violence have spiraled. Seleka is a predominantly Muslim coalition, and to counter the attacks on Christian communities, vigilante Christian groups have fought back. The United Nations has said it fears a genocide is brewing, and aid agencies warn of a humanitarian crisis. At least 1,000 people have died in the violence, and some 958,000 more, many of them children, have been forced from their homes within the Central African Republic, according to the United Nations' refugee agency, UNHCR. There are also more than 86,000 refugees in Cameroon, Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo who fled the Central African Republic in 2013, the UNHCR said Friday. Some 100,000 people have gathered at a makeshift camp by the international airport in Bangui, seeking refuge from the violence. UNHCR this week resumed deliveries of food and humanitarian supplies to those at the airport site after peacekeeping troops were brought in to maintain order. The agency will distribute aid including blankets, sleeping mats, soap, mosquito nets and plastic sheets to some 20,000 families, or about 100,000 people, it said. The U.N. agency appealed for $40.2 million to help respond to the crisis over the next three months.","About 1,000 Chadians and 700 Malians are to be flown home in the next four days .

"(CNN) -- A 34-year-old man is in custody in connection with a fatal subway incident over the weekend in New York City, police said Tuesday. A man was pushed to his death from the subway platform into the path of the D train on Sunday. Bronx resident Wai Kuen Kwok, 61, was killed by the incoming subway train, police said. Kwok's wife was with him and was taken to the hospital for trauma, though she was not physically injured. Kwok was standing on the platform at the subway station at 167th Street and Grand Concourse when he was apparently pushed. First responders arrived at about 8:45 a.m., and Kwok was pronounced dead at the scene. The suspect then fled the station. As of late Tuesday, no charges have been filed, according to Lt. John Grimpel. CNN's David Shortell and Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.","No charges have been filed against a 34-year-old man being held .

"(CNN) -- Does the idea of spending time in the Magic Kingdom with the Mickey Mouse gang leave you thinking ""Oh, rats!""? Does the idea of spending time with the hot people of Miami's trendy South Beach leave you cold? Well, don't give up on Florida just yet. There's still a Sunshine State for folks like us -- it's ""Old Florida."" (And I'm not talking retirement communities here). Sometimes thought of as ""Forgotten Florida,"" I'm talking about the more northerly portions of the state. It's the part that thrived a century ago during the first waves of development but has been bypassed by most tourists in recent decades for Orlando and points south. This is the Florida where the Deep South intermingles with the tropics. Here, oaks draped with Spanish moss stand guard over saw palmetto and vivid flowers. They all thrive by crystal-clear rivers and springs. Its towns are smaller, quiet and friendly. Many of its attractions emphasize the natural environment. It's a place for hiking, biking, kayaking, snorkeling, tubing and fishing. And you can enjoy it all without devastating your wallet and facing large or pretentious crowds. I made two visits down there this summer and fall. Here are nine spots worthy of a visit: . 1. Cedar Key . Welcome to Mayberry by the Sea. This Gulf Coast fishing village, about 50 miles southwest of Gainesville, is gloriously isolated and seemingly of another era. There are no chain restaurants, hotels or grocery stores here (or none that I ran across). What you will find here: An unassuming town of modest and funky tin-roofed homes, a few '50s-style motels and quaint shops. Lots of folks get around via golf carts and bicycles, which they don't seem to ever lock up. Art is a big part of the town, with all manner of public displays popping up. Charter boats at the marina offer fishing excursions and exploration rides, including sunset cruises. With such a relaxed atmosphere, Cedar Key has a bit of a Key West vibe -- minus the all-night party atmosphere. This is a town that goes mostly silent by 10 p.m. Cedar Key's culinary fame is clam chowder. The Big Deck had such good chowder I went back for a second night. If you seek a traditional, white-sand beach with aqua Gulf of Mexico waters right at your doorstep, you need to go elsewhere. But if you want to escape to another time where simple pleasures rule, Cedar Key is the place. 2. Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park . One word: Manatees. They got 'em, and you can see these gentle giants feeding on heads of lettuce from an underwater observation deck. This is a wonderful state park dedicated to native flora and fauna (minus one hippo that is a holdover from another incarnation of the park). The birds in particular are spectacular, but you can also see bears, bobcats and gators -- oh my! Do not skip the 15-minute-or-so boat ride from the parking area to the animal displays, where they take you down a narrow, blackwater creek. You feel like you're in a jungle. And you kind of are. At $13 for one adult, the admission is more than is typical for Florida state parks, but it's worth it. 3. Alexander Springs, Ocala National Forest . This is no ordinary swimming hole, unless you've been dipping in a pool of chilly gin before. The water is that clear and that cool. Honestly. Alexander Springs is one of several in Ocala National Forest, a true gem of a wilderness that will evoke memories of ""The Yearling"" if you ever read that Pulitzer-winning novel. If you get tired of swimming in the brisk, limpid waters, you can explore the lush surrounding forest on a boardwalk and trail. Be sure to arrive early if you come on a hot summer weekend. There's limited parking. 4. Stephen Foster Folk Culture Center State Park . Way down upon the Suwannee River, far, far away from Florida's more crowded tourist sites, lies a pretty little state park not so far from Georgia and an easy jump off Interstate 75. Honoring American composer Stephen Foster, this park is perched by the famed river that looks like moving black glass contained by tall, white-sand banks. You can't swim here (gators), but you can hike alongside the intriguing, mysterious waterway or go canoeing. You can also enjoy Foster exhibits, including old pianos and desks he used. Check the park's calendar -- they have various programs throughout the year. No need to bring your iPod; the park's 97-bell carillon housed in an impressively tall brick tower provides the musical backdrop. The nearby town of White Springs has some pretty old homes, too. 5. Apalachicola and Eastpoint . If you love oysters, you probably have heard about this place. If you don't love oysters, you should still check it out. Apalachicola oozes ""Old Florida"" charm. Set alongside a namesake bay and river, this town has one foot in the workday world of harvesting the Gulf's riches and the other foot in artsy boutiques and the like. Somehow, they combine nicely. Up the Creek Raw Bar provides a fantastic view to enjoy a dozen oysters and a beer. Be sure to venture out from the little business district. Apalachicola has some lovely, meticulously maintained homes over which you'll drool. I stayed across the bay in nearby Eastpoint, which is even smaller, more blue collar and boutique-free. The Sportsman's Lodge offers a great price. The rooms are dated and a bit stuffy, but the grounds, overflowing with foliage and overrun with peacocks, more than make up for it. And it is perfectly poised to take in awe-inspiring, multicolored sunsets. Bring plenty o' mosquito repellent lest that sunset be your last. 6. St. George Island State Park . It's often cited in Top 10 Florida beach lists, and with good reason. This stretch of the Gulf of Mexico is stunning, and this park is poised to take full advantage. Dune restoration and preservation are emphasized, and the park is a short drive from Eastpoint and Apalachicola. If you're not a fan of crowds, this is the place to be. This is a big place with miles and miles of beach unadulterated by condos, high-rises and general seashore tackiness. Camping sites are available for folks who like to do that. 7. St. Joseph Peninsula State Park . In the same general area as St. George, you can't go wrong with this park, either. If anything, I liked it a little more. There didn't seem to be as much beach and parking for visitors, but the green and blue waters and soft sands were just as inviting. What really sold me on St. Joseph were the bayside trails; they were nothing less than outstanding. I heard a symphony of birds and insects on my hike, and every turn of the trail revealed another splendid mix of green pines, brown marsh grasses, white sand, dark blue water and pale blue sky. This little slice of paradise costs gas money to drive there and 4 bucks for a single adult. A carload of folks gets in for $2 more. 8. Wakulla Springs State Park . Florida is truly blessed with freshwater springs, and Wakulla is another standout. Not too far from Tallahassee, it's hard to find, but worth the trouble. The park has trails for hiking, but the big attractions are the swimming area and the one-hour riverboat rides, which are well worth the $8 for an adult. You get up close and personal with all manner of exotic birds, big fat alligators (and I do mean big and fat) and, if you're lucky, a few manatees. We were striking it so rich with wildlife on our ride that our generous flat-boat captain let us stay out an extra 15 minutes. I had the cool swimming area to myself on a weekday in October, but I imagine it's filled up with splashy, happy children in northern Florida's hot summer weekends. 9. Amelia Island and Fernandina Beach . I'm an Atlantic Ocean kind of fellow, so I had to end with a nod to the salty waters I know best. You can't go any higher up and still be in Florida. Amelia Island and Fernandina definitely have a Georgia/Carolinas kind of feel -- in a good way. The beach here is an Atlantic classic: wide and inviting. The gray water was still plenty warm for swimming in October. If you like riding waves, you get more action than typical on Gulf beaches. Downtown Fernandina is definitely the most upscale of the places on this list, but it still had a down-to-earth charm. If you enjoy gawking at homes as much as I do, you'll be in heaven here. 6th Street in particular seemed to be replete with Southern classics. For my last meal in ""Old Florida,"" I skipped the seafood and ate at The Happy Tomato. Go for the fun name. Stay for the cozy courtyard and the pimento cheese sandwich. Have you been to these places? What other parts of ""Old Florida"" have you explored and would recommend? Please share your memories and suggestions in the comments below.","Cedar Key, on the Gulf, is a classic fishing village that feels like something from another era .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Records from a cell phone used by President-elect Obama were improperly breached, apparently by employees of the cell phone company, his transition team said Thursday. An Obama spokesman said the transition team was told employees at Verizon Wireless looked through billing records. Spokesman Robert Gibbs said the team was notified Wednesday by Verizon Wireless that it appears an employee improperly went through billing records for the phone, which Gibbs said Obama no longer uses. In an internal company e-mail obtained by CNN, Verizon Wireless President and CEO Lowell McAdam disclosed Wednesday that ""the personal wireless account of President-elect Barack Obama had been accessed by employees not authorized to do so"" in recent months. McAdam wrote in the e-mail that the phone in question has been inactive for ""several months"" and was a simple voice flip-phone, meaning none of Obama's e-mail could have been accessed. The CEO also wrote the company has alerted ""the appropriate federal law enforcement authorities."" Gibbs said that while the Secret Service has been notified, he is not aware of any criminal investigation. He said he believes it was billing records that were accessed. Gibbs said that anyone viewing the records likely would have been able to see phone numbers and the frequency of calls Obama made, but that ""nobody was monitoring voicemail or anything like that."" Verizon Wireless, meanwhile, has launched an internal probe to determine whether Obama's information was simply shared among employees or whether ""the information of our customer had in any way been compromised outside our company, and this investigation continues,"" according to McAdam. In the e-mail, McAdam said that employees who were permitted access to these records will be allowed to return to work, but employees who accessed the account for ""anything other than legitimate business purposes will face disciplinary action, up to and including termination.""

"(CNN) -- Polish football fans have celebrated the launch of the biggest stadium for this year's Euro 2012 finals with a free music festival and fireworks display. The newly-constructed National Stadium in Warsaw will host the opening match of the four-yearly tournament on June 8 when co-hosts Poland take on Euro 2004 winners Greece in Group A. The first 40,000 fans to arrive on Sunday were given the chance to see Polish pop acts including VooVoo i Haydamaky, Zakopower, Coma, T. Love and Lady Pank. The at the 50,000-seat arena, which will also host a semifinal, was built on the site of the old 10th Anniversary Stadium, which had stood since 1955 and welcomed Pope John Paul II in 1983. ""I am very happy that the National Stadium has been finally unveiled,"" Poland's tournament director Adam Olkowicz told the website of European football's governing body UEFA. ""It's the biggest Polish venue for this year's final tournament. On June 8, we will witness the opening ceremony here followed by the first match between Poland and Greece. ""I hope that Poland's players play to their best, with the backing of thousands of local supporters."" On February 29, Franciszek Smuda's Poland team will play in their new home for the first time -- exactly 100 days before the start of Euro 2012 -- when they take on Portugal, who boast players such as Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo. The first football match to be played at the stadium, located on the east bank of the river Vistula, will be a Polish Super Cup clash between Legia Warsaw and Wisla Krakow on February 11. The National Stadium is one of five venues built especially for the 14th European Championship, which is being co-hosted with Ukraine, and one of three new stadia in Poland. The other two are the Arena Gdansk and the Municipal Stadium in Wroclaw.","The new National Stadium in the Polish capital of Warsaw was opened on Sunday .

"Gaza City, Gaza (CNN) -- Terrace crowds are controlled by men wearing army fatigues and holding Kalashnikov rifles, players and press pray on the pitch at half-time and when the final whistle is blown, the trophy is handed to the winning captain by one of Israel's most wanted men. Welcome to football, Gaza style. More than 5,000 fans crammed into the Palestine Stadium in Gaza City for what is an increasingly rare occasion these days: a game of football.   The ""Gaza Dialogue and Tolerance Cup final"" between Al Shate (a mixed team of Hamas and Fatah members that represents the 80,000 strong Al Shate refugee camp) played Al Salah Islamic Association (a team aligned with Hamas) in a tight match in front of raucous fans who flew blue and yellow flags and fired off flames from lit cans of hairspray in support of their side. However, as with most things in the Gaza Strip, war, politics and internal divisions are never far away. The beautiful game is inordinately popular in the tiny strip of 1.5 million people. The Palestinian national football squad has no less than 15 players representing Gaza and over the past 50 years dozens of teams have flourished, each with its own affiliation to different political groups. Even Hamas' Ismail Haniyeh -- the de facto Palestinian prime minister who is a high-profile fugitive from Israeli authorities -- has a soft spot for the game.   In his youth he was a talented, no-nonsense defender for Al Shate, his home neighborhood. To underline the importance of the match, designed to promote harmony between political factions, Haniyeh turned up to present the cup. But since Hamas, a militant Islamist group, seized control of Gaza from Fatah in 2007, football has been brought to the brink of extinction. Hamas did more than take over Gaza's political and economic apparatus. They also took over all of Gaza's top sports and football clubs.   ""We as sports people want to remove sport from politics but politicians on both sides, Hamas and Fatah, play on this, they try to make politics come into sport,"" explained Ibraheem Abu Saleem, vice president of the Palestinian Football Association [PFA] and the man in charge of the game in Gaza. ""The main problem lies with Hamas. When Hamas hands back the clubs to their legal board of directors, sport will be running again in Gaza as in the West Bank."" Angered by the political intrusion in sport, the PFA, based in the West Bank, refused to organize a league until the teams were handed back. Hamas declined and the football league has been dormant ever since the putsch.   Instead the clubs have been left to organize their own small, increasingly irregular tournaments. The best players simply left for the West Bank, but since Israel's war in Gaza last winter, that exodus has been halted due to movement restrictions. In comparison football in the Fatah-controlled West Bank is thriving. The league was non existent three years ago. Now Palestinians turn up in huge numbers to matches, sometimes attracting as many as 15,000 fans. Private businesses have poured money into sponsoring their favorite teams and a brand new stadium was built on the outskirts of East Jerusalem to host the Palestinian national team's first ever home international last year. ""Here in the West Bank we have two members of Hamas on the board. We have teams for Hamas, the PFLP [Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine],"" said Jibril Rajoub, President of the PFA, a former National Security Advisor to Yasser Arafat and a leading member of Fatah recently elected to the Fatah Central Committee. ""There is a wall here between politics and factionalism in sport [in the West Bank]. I think the same should happen in Gaza."" Back in Gaza, Al Shate and their non-aligned fans left the happier, securing a 2-0 victory. But for the players, stuck between Hamas and the PFA, it was bittersweet.   ""The takeover of the clubs is the main reason for us not having any competition and I want Hamas to give the clubs back,"" agreed Hamada Shbair, the winning captain of Al Shate and a Palestinian international who hasn't played for the national team since 2008 because of Israeli and Egyptian travel restrictions. Shbair celebrated along with thousands of fans who carried their cup from the stadium back to the camp in procession. It was the first silverware in a quarter of a century for Al Shate, who have so far escaped the Hamas takeover.   But Shbair used the victory to make his views known to Haniyeh during the presentation of the cup. ""I told him: 'You used to be a player, please solve this problem of the players quickly.' He replied: 'I hope so, Inshallah (God willing).'"" Gaza's football-mad population may have to savour Al Shate's victorious cup campaign for a while yet as no one knows when, or even if, the next competition will take place. But for Shbair, victory has sent a powerful message to his people.   ""The Beach Camp [Al Shate] is very crowded, 80,000 people, and we wanted this team to make people happy after the war and the martyrs and the siege,"" he said. ""But this club is also open to all people in Gaza. So it is a victory for moderation.""","5,000 Palestinians turn out for a rare football tournament in Gaza City.

"Washington (CNN) -- ""Let us never forget that government is ourselves and not an alien power over us. The ultimate rulers of our democracy are not a president and senators and congressmen and government officials, but the voters of this country."" -- Franklin D. Roosevelt . When I began the Facebook fan page ""Join the Coffee Party Movement,"" I had no idea what would transpire. It was about 1:30 a.m. January 26, and I was very frustrated with the endless news coverage about the Tea Party and the growing narrative that it represented America. I was driven by a question, a curiosity: If I build it, will they come? Would anyone respond to my call for civility in our political discourse and cooperation in government? First they came virtually. More than 155,000 joined the fan page in less than six weeks. But were they real people? Inside a town hall meeting room in Haymarket, Virginia, last Saturday morning, and then at The Potter's House in Washington that afternoon, I had an answer to my questions. In Haymarket, two dozen people came, ten of them veterans. In Washington, a hundred people came. In all, we had reports of more than 350 events held for ""National Coffee Party Day"" in at least 44 states; even Americans living abroad gathered in Italy, Panama and Indonesia. People from all walks of life and all political dispositions sat together as fellow Americans to discuss their concerns about our politics: accountability, corporate influence, health care reform, education reform, the economy, immigration reform, filibusters, etc. There was a generally shared anxiety for many that corporations were gaming the political process. There was passion and excitement about what the Coffee Party could become politically and personally. Here was a chance for people to have a voice in our government and hope in our future. In just a few weeks, the Facebook page had become a town square where people could meet, talk, learn, engage, share, serve and be part of a community. All day Saturday, messages and reports were sent directly to Coffee Party organizers and left on the Facebook fan page from across the country, ""The event exceeded my expectations ... I was expecting 20 people and a hundred showed up ... We can't wait to meet again ... It was amazing. I was surprised that we were able to sit and have a civil conversation with a Tea Party member ... I don't feel alone now ..."" What is going on? It seems to me that the Coffee Party members are a silent and extremely frustrated majority only too happy to find one another. Over the course of many years, Americans have grown accustomed to thinking of two-party politics as a kind of a zero-sum game. If one team wins, the other team loses. The game framework encourages many Americans to be spectators passively watching professional politicians go at each other. Furthermore, it invites people to ""game"" the process to advance their personal or partisan agendas. In Washington, recently the tactics have become so vicious that the game looks more like Ultimate Fighting. This is not acceptable. The game framework is not an intrinsic quality of democracy. In fact, it is inconsistent with the basic tenets of democracy. Democracy presupposes a community of people deliberating, through their elected representatives, to advance the common good -- a method of collective decision-making. When we regard politics as a game, we all lose. Because when it comes down to it, politics is about all of our futures. In America, we have a democracy, but with vulnerabilities and loopholes. One loophole is that the most active and organized constituents have disproportionate influence over our government. For instance, corporations can afford to pay thousands of lobbyists to work full-time at doing this. This gives them a disproportionate influence over our government and presents a serious challenge to democracy in America. This is really at the root of our discontent: our government's relationship to corporate America and this special interest seems altogether unconstitutional. As the Constitution dictates, we want a government of the people, by the people, for the people. Coffee Party USA is a democracy movement, and our goal is to have the government truly reflect the will of the people. How do we restore the primacy of ordinary people in our government? We can find immediate institutional solutions -- for example, changing Senate rules and procedures that impede government, countering misinformation and promoting campaign finance reform and term limits. There is a profound relationship problem between the government and the people that it serves. Many Americans feel alienated from the corrupted political process, the dysfunction of the government and the seeming polarization of our society. The health care debate and the spectacle of the August town halls laid open all that alienation and despair. Since August, many of us chose to cocoon in our homes, growing more frustrated and outraged over our diseased political system. This is a terrible state of affairs because the public's disengagement from politics is the greatest threat to a democracy. We are proposing to address this threat, to practice democracy at the local level and create a home in the public sphere. What better place than a neighborhood coffee shop to create that home? There are three steps to this model of participatory democracy. The first step is creating a public space for open and civil dialogue. The second step is collective deliberation, considering facts and values to arrive at a decision. The third step is working toward implementing the decision. We will practice all three steps as a community, pledging to be civil to each other. Our next national event is the ""Coffee Summit"" on the weekend of March 27, coming to a coffee shop near you -- followed by ""Coffee With Congress"" during the April congressional recess. We will be asking our representatives to sit down with us over coffee. You are all invited to join us.

"(CNN) -- Yemen's embattled president told the country's largest opposition bloc he would step down at the beginning of next year, a ruling party official told CNN. The opposition rejected the offer, demanding that Ali Abdullah Saleh resign immediately. Saleh pushed back against opponents including some of his own top generals Tuesday, defying calls for him to quit. ""Those who want to reach power through a coup will be unable to. This is impossible. The scenario will turn into a civil war,"" Saleh said in a televised speech. ""There is a constitution, and there are rules. There is the will of the people. It is impossible for a minority to control the fate of the nation,"" he said. Also Tuesday, Yemen's army repelled an attack on a military position by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, killing 12 militants and wounding five, a Yemeni official told CNN, citing sources at the Interior Ministry in Sanaa. The official, who spoke on condition of not being named because he is not authorized to talk to the media, said the attack occurred east of the city of Lawdar, in Abyan province in southwest Yemen. Saleh, who has been in power for 32 years, has been a key U.S. ally as al Qaeda turns his country into a base. It is not clear when Saleh made his offer to step down in 2012 to the opposition JMP bloc, the largest opposition group, but they rejected his speech Tuesday. ""Any offer that does not include the president's immediate resignation is rejected,"" said Mohammed Qahtan, a JMP spokesman. The president's defiant speech came a day after Saleh met a top general who announced he was supporting the protests that have been roiling Yemen since the beginning of the year. Even officials in Saleh's own party expressed worries about the speech, which came on the heels of a particularly tense day in Yemen. ""It will cause more concern, and I think this will only increase the tension,"" ruling party official Mohammed Abulahoum told CNN. ""I hope that the military and the police and all units will not obey any order of any individual that asks them to point their guns at their people. After all, they are there to defend the people,"" he said. Some government officials and others have declared their support for the opposition in the wake of a government crackdown on protesters that left 52 people dead last week. On Tuesday, Rupert Colville of the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed concern about the situation in Yemen. The agency deplored the reported killings of protesters, including allegations of snipers shooting from rooftops, Colville told a news briefing in Geneva. ""All such violations of human rights must indeed be investigated by independent and impartial mechanisms,"" Colville said. Saleh and Maj. Gen. Ali Mohsen Al-Ahmar on Monday discussed a deal for a peaceful transition of power that would allow Salehto to stay in place for the rest of the year, a Yemeni official and senior U.S. official said. Then on Tuesday, Saleh appeared to criticize the powerful general and other officers who declared their support for the opposition on Monday, saying, ""Any division in the military will have negative impacts on the whole country."" A government official said the speech was a warning to those who broke ranks. ""Saleh was sending a message to the generals who defected yesterday, telling them, you know you're going to come back, so why not come back now rather than trying to do so later?"" said the official, who asked not to be named because of the sensitive situation. Al-Ahmar, who belongs to an important tribe whose backing is significant for Saleh, said Monday he would order his troops to protect civilians demonstrating against the president. A wave of other officials announced their support for the opposition Monday. They included Yemen's ambassador to Britain and the embassy's entire diplomatic staff, as well as Yemen's ambassador to the European Union, Mohamed Jaffer. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Tuesday the United States was ""obviously concerned about the instability in Yemen. We consider al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which is largely located in Yemen, to be perhaps the most dangerous of all the franchises of al Qaeda right now."" Radical American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki is believed to be hiding in the country. The cleric has been linked to terror plots including the attempt to bomb a Detroit-bound plane on Christmas Day 2009, and he corresponded separately with a British Airways employee about trying to smuggle explosives onto planes. Top American officials, including U.S. President Barack Obama's counterterrorism chief, have traveled to Yemen to meet with Saleh. Leaked diplomatic cables suggest Saleh's government helped disguise strikes by U.S. unmanned drones on terror targets in Yemen by calling them Yemeni actions. CNN's Tracy Doueiry, Caroline Faraj, Elise Labott, Richard Roth, Pam Benson and Jo Shelley and journalist Hakim Almasmari contributed to this report.","NEW: Source says military kills 12 Al-Qaeda militants in repelling an attack .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- ""Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans -- born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage ..."" — John F. Kennedy, inaugural address, 1961 . At the risk of being accused of ageism, let me suggest that the Republican Party should set its mind in 2016 to nominating a presidential candidate who is young enough to make their likely Democratic opponent look, well, not so young. In November 2016, Hillary Clinton — who won't be the only Democrat running in the primaries, but will surely be the frontrunner — will be 69 years old. Already, we've seen one headline that spells out what a lot of Americans may be thinking: ""Is Hillary Clinton Too Old to be President?"" We're not supposed to ask that question or mention Hillary's age. That's because she's a woman and a Democrat and we're only allowed to bring up a candidate's age when we're talking about men and Republicans. Besides, Clinton is a baby Boomer, and that demographic of 70 million Americans is determined -- by virtue of sheer size -- to redefine every stage of life. We can expect to read plenty of articles in the months to come, green lit by baby boomer editors, about how 70 is the new 40. Or something like that. All spinning aside, here's the bad news for Democrats: While Americans have come to expect that being president tends to prematurely age whomever occupies the office, when it comes to electing a president, they still seem prefer to vote for people for whom the aging process isn't already too far along. That's a polite way of saying that voters often prefer younger candidates to older ones. In the field of politics -- as in sports and entertainment -- many people worship at the altar of youth and what President Kennedy used to call ""vigor."" Even in the best of times -- economic prosperity, a healthy job market, no threats to our national security and so on -- being president is a tough gig. The job is intellectually taxing, emotionally draining, and physically demanding. I would imagine that just the daily terror briefings alone, where the president is informed of all the plots that were foiled by authorities the night before, is enough to turn one's hair white. There have been exceptions. In 1984, President Reagan -- at 73 -- famously quipped during a debate with his 56-year-old Democratic opponent, Walter Mondale, that he wouldn't ""exploit for political purposes my opponent's youth and inexperience."" In his runaway bid for re-election, Reagan carried 49 states. But there are lots of examples of youth carrying the day. -- Kennedy had no qualms about exploiting youth for political purposes. In 1946, the Massachusetts Democrat vied for the state's 11th congressional district. Campaign posters offered the slogan: ""A New Generation Offers a Leader."" Kennedy won; he was just 29 years old. It was 15 years later, at 44, as he was sworn in as president, that he talked about how the ""torch"" of leadership had been passed to his cohort -- the fabled ""World War II Generation."" -- In 1992, 46-year-old Bill Clinton went on MTV, played the saxophone on ""The Arsenio Hall Show"" and told Americans -- in the words of Fleetwood Mac -- ""don't stop thinking about tomorrow."" In that race, Clinton defeated the incumbent president, 68-year-old George H.W. Bush. In 1996, a 50-year-old Clinton beat Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, who was 73 years old. -- In 2008, after a campaign full of whispers about his opponent's health and vitality, 47-year-old Barack Obama handily defeated Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who was 72 at the time. Four years later, in 2012, a 51-year-old Obama cruised to victory over 65-year-old Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor. Now imagine how 2016 could shape up. By then, a 69-year-old Hillary Clinton could find herself slugging through a tougher-than-expected Democratic primary against a 73-year-old Joe Biden or Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who will then be 67 years old. Democrats should take a good hard look at more youthful candidates such as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who will be 58 years old, or a 53-year-old Martin O'Malley, the governor of Maryland. Meanwhile, Republicans should definitely be looking for a younger candidate on the assumption that Clinton will be the nominee. In fact, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus should just flat-out declare that -- for this job -- anyone over 60 years old need not apply. Some might consider this requirement unfair, even tantamount to age discrimination. Not so. All sorts of jobs have mandatory age limits attached to them. Why not the presidency? It's true that, in 2016, there will be millions of Americans who are older than 60. But I would wager that more of them will -- at that stage of life -- be interested in easing into retirement than running for president. Older voters don't necessarily vote for older candidates, just as younger voters don't always support younger candidates. A GOP age limit would still leave an opening for what will be, in 2016, a pair of promising 45-year-old Hispanic senators — Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky would also make the cut since he'll only be 53 years old. Rounding out the top tier of GOP hopefuls, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker will be 49 years old, and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will be 54 years old. The bad news: Capping applicants at 60 would exclude one of the best Republican prospects — former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who will be 63 in 2016. The good news: It'll also spare the country another Quixotic presidential campaign by Mitt Romney, who would be 69. This isn't about ability. It's about electability. So the question isn't whether a given candidate is too old to serve as president. It's whether voters are willing to hand the presidency over to someone who they perceive as too old. In 2016, the message to both parties should be: ""Go young — or go home.""","Ruben Navarrette: 2016 GOP candidate should be young, to make Dem opponent look old .
He says we're 'allowed' to mention older male candidates' age but not Hillary's. It's an issue .

"(CNN) -- Oscar-nominated screenwriter John Milius, author of some of Hollywood's most famous lines from films such as ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Dirty Harry"" and ""Jaws,"" is a student of history -- especially the history of war. Five years after his HBO's mini-series ""Rome,"" Milius is currently in pre-production on an epic film about the life of the infamous warlord Genghis Khan. Milius, who penned legendary lines such as ""Apocalypse Now's"" ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning,"" and ""Dirty Harry's"" ""Well do you [feel lucky], punk?"" names a few war movies he doesn't like -- and a few others that are his all-time favorites. In this edited transcript, Milius reveals why he's a big fan of ""The Hurt Locker,"" which has garnered nine Oscar nominations, including best picture and best director. CNN: Would you like to compare ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""The Hurt Locker?"" John Milius: Well no, they're very different. But one of the things that I think is comparable is that they don't really make any commentary on the war itself. There's no political commentary. Whether the war is right wrong or indifferent because that's like saying a rainstorm is right wrong or indifferent. Wars can be unjust, wars can be horrible. That's not the purpose of either of those films. The film is an examination of what people do within that experience. You go back to ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" -- we must have our guilt about war because we all share that -- we certainly share a guilt about war. ""The Hurt Locker"" looks at the whole condition of war and endeavor and -- like they say -- war is human abrasion. It's like the rest of life -- with the heat turned up. It's this whole thing of the exhilaration of endeavor of life and risk. It's an animal attraction. Not only is this guy deactivating bombs, but he likes it. He likes deactivating bombs! He loves the challenge. I love it when he's in a car and he finds a little booby trap and he goes, ""Ooh, nice!"" I think it's very interesting that they've made a bunch of movies about Iraq and all of them basically have been anti-American movies and they've made no money and they've garnered no attention of any kind. And this movie is not anti-American, it's just what it is. It doesn't take the presumption that we all want to see something to run down our country. We're at war. I feel my own way about it. I feel that people have the right to criticize the war. But to assume that we should all feel that way is an arrogant assumption. This movie doesn't shove into people's faces the idea of how terrible the war is, how horrible we're for being there how we're raping children every day, how we're doing all this kind of stuff. Inside the heads of 'Hurt Locker' Bomb defusers . CNN: What are your top war movies of all time? Milius: The best war movie of all time is ""Battleground."" It's about the Battle of the Bulge, made by William Wellman, 1949, it's just unparalleled in its authenticity, in its artistry, the vision of the human spirit. It's just superb. What's really great about it is everything is played down. It's about all the aspects of war. They're muted the way they really would be in war. CNN: What does it share with ""The Hurt Locker?"" Milius: The intensity. It's about camaraderie, it's about the horrors and all of it being secondary to the overall experience. What I liked about what [director Kathryn Bigelow] did was she shot it very clean. She didn't let her technique get in the way. She told a story. CNN: Does ""The Hurt Locker"" have any shortcomings? Milius: The only question I questioned when I first saw it was the sniper sequence. How did they suddenly become so good at being snipers? These are EOD [explosive ordinance disposal] men. Snipers take a tremendous amount of training. Apparently they are cross-trained in sniping, I don't know -- somebody has told me that. But I think it's OK. CNN: What are some war movies you don't like? Milius: ""Black Hawk Down"" is garbage. The book was superb. In the movie, you don't know who anyone is, you can't tell who anyone is. It's all so cool because it's [director] Ridley Scott, who has to be so much cooler than the rest of us, who's so detached and he has to show his vision is more important than telling you where they are, where the machine gun is ... I'm not a great fan of ""The Deer Hunter."" It's interesting but it has very little to do with Vietnam. ""Platoon"" is a very good movie. But it's not my favorite. ""Platoon"" is a very harrowing experience -- but it's not something you want to see again and again. It's [director and Vietnam War veteran Oliver Stone's] war. It has incredible credibility because of that. But it's not everybody's war. It's something particular to him. If you look at ""Platoon,"" you tend to want to believe it. Whereas in ""Inglourious Basterds,"" it's truly a comic book. [Tarantino] does shoot it in his own way. It has its own rules. And it works, in a strange way. It's like [legendary Italian director] Sergio Leone. Quentin has done a tremendous amount for loosening up the whole stodgy industry. Quentin's a genuine rogue out there. CNN: Is a Tarantino-Milius collaboration in the works? Milius: We collaborate. He told me that I influenced the first scene in [""Inglourious Basterds""]. He told me, ""I wrote that stuff when I was talking to you on the phone."" I said, ""Did I write a scene in that movie?"" He said, ""yeah."" He didn't note it though. He forgot. CNN: Have you seen ""Avatar,"" where a private army in the future tries to take over a planet? Milius: No I haven't seen it. Sounds sort of like Blackwater. I just hope Blackwater survives into the 22nd century, or whatever -- [laughs] I'd probably be on the side of the Blackwater people. ""Avatar"" is what movies are becoming. ""Avatar"" is like a really good water slide. You know, you get on and you slide around all these things and then you get on and slide down again. Remember in ""Talladega Nights"" when the French driver character asks, ""Do you know why I came to America?"" and Will Farrell's character says, ""Health care systems, giant water parks. The same reason anyone comes to America."" This started with ""Star Wars."" I don't consider ""Star Wars"" a movie. It's a good water slide. It's great to be a water slide movie. Maybe they should have a different category: amusement park movies or best ride. Not best picture, best ride, most money made. [""Avatar"" director] Jim Cameron's a really good director. CNN: Did you attend the Oscars when you were nominated for 1979's ""Apocalypse Now?"" Milius: I don't take the Academy Awards terribly seriously. Every year there's Academy Awards and it's very important to people in Hollywood because it's the senior prom. They put me on the edge of the [stage] like I was going to win. But the minute I was there, I knew I wasn't going to win. I could just tell the mood of the Academy. And they gave all the Oscars to another movie that was really an undistinguished movie -- a joke, as a matter of fact. We were beaten by a TV movie. This was ""Kramer vs. Kramer."" People lately have said to me in interviews, ""How do you feel about not winning an Oscar?"" And I said I never gave it any thought. I long ago did not think about winning Oscars. I have a different philosophy of life.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Milius.","Oscar-nominated writer John Milius rates war films, including ""The Hurt Locker""

"(CNN) -- Eighty years after Hoovervilles sprung up around the country, and four months after tens of thousands descended on the Wisconsin state capitol, progressives have a new home in what they're calling Walkerville. The Madison tent city is named in honor -- or, more accurately, in defiance -- of Gov. Scott Walker, who became an icon for conservatives and lightning rod for liberals after he pushed through a controversial new collective bargaining law earlier this year. David Boetcher, one of Walkerville's coordinators, said the aim is to recapture the spirit of Hoovervilles, the shanty towns that popped up and were named to tweak President Herbert Hoover's perceived inaction in the Great Depression's early years. Since Saturday night's kick-off, about 80 tents have sprung up in and around State Street in Madison, with a handful of people sticking it out throughout but mostly fresh rounds of activists rotating through on a daily basis. ""Just like the original Hoovervilles in the 1930s, we wanted to create that type of atmosphere without being destructive,"" said Boetcher, a government affairs coordinator for the IBEW union. Some major differences, of course, are that Walkerville will only be up for two weeks, its participants generally can go home, and it is more of a staged political event. Boetcher noted that, unlike the February protests, this edition is carefully planned with permits, rules, a schedule of speakers and a conscious effort to make a point without disrupting local businesses. There's a new theme each day: On Sunday, for instance, protests focused on planned $800 million cuts to K-12 education. And one of the most anticipated moments will be Monday, when hundreds of firefighters -- who were exempted from Walker's original collective bargaining law, but could see cuts in its more recent incarnation -- are expected to march in Madison. Judge strikes down collective bargaining restrictions . It is highly unlikely that organizers, at any point, will match the tens of thousands who, at times, occupied the capitol building in protest this winter. Times have changed, as have public sentiments and strategies. Much of their efforts recently centered around recall petitions aimed at ousting several Republican senators and turning the chamber over to Democrats. ""There was this immediacy and a real intensity at the beginning,"" recalled Kerry Motoviloff, the head of Madison's teachers' union. ""That intensity is still in people's hearts, but now we've entered the next phase for the long term. ... And Walkerville is just another way for us to get the message out."" One major goal, and challenge, with events like Walkerville is to keep up pressure on Walker and other Republican leaders without alienating independents who will eventually decide whether to affirm or reject their decisions, Boetcher said. ""The idea is to balance between a group's right to protest vs. acting in such a manner that people this is too irritating, we don't agree with it,"" he said. ""(The general public) doesn't want to talk about people being arrested. And (demonstrators) know what the rules are this time."" Progressive leaders in Wisconsin insist their message is getting through, including among independents who might have voted for Walker but have since soured on his and Republican tactics in addressing the budget situation. ""There's an incredible amount of frustration,"" said Steve Hanson, a progressive blogger in northwest Wisconsin. ""There is a basic feeling that all these laws are going to be rammed through the legislature, and there's nothing you can do about it."" Yet for all this talk on the left, there's been no change in who controls Madison -- Republicans -- nor any indication that they intend to back down. Whether it has to do with collective bargaining, voting requirements or a host of other matters, the GOP still has the upper hand as it's proven in pushing through a host of measures in the months after the February confrontation. And Walker, especially, continues to be a darling of the nationwide conservative movement, as does like-minded Wisconsin Republican U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan. In April, Sarah Palin urged others nationwide to follow Madison's example in targeting the benefits and pay of unions, despite intense pressure. ""This is where real courage and real solidarity can be found,"" the 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee said. ""You saw these violent rent-a-mobs trash your capital and vandalize businesses. You held your ground. Your governor did the same thing. And you won."" The law that sharply curbs the collective bargaining rights of most state employees remains the biggest, most critical piece in the fight. Republicans insist that the measure is necessary to control skyrocketing public employee benefit costs and close a $137 million budget shortfall. Democrats argue that it is little more than an attempt to gut public-sector labor unions, one of their core constituencies. On Monday, Wisconsin's Supreme Court is set to weigh whether or not they will take up the battle over the law, weeks after Wisconsin Judge Maryann Sumi struck it down. State Democratic leaders claim that Republican legislators violated the state's open meetings law by calling a committee meeting to amend Walker's budget bill without providing the necessary public 24-hour advance notice. Democrats say they were given only two hours' notice. While the court will have their say, Boetcher says the long-term vision is to use events like Walkerville to reach those in the middle and convince them that they're better off voting out Republicans like the governor. ""This isn't about changing the minds of the Republican legislature,"" said Boetcher, claiming they've turned a ""deaf ear"" to such protests. ""The ear we want to reach is the Wisconsin voter."" Still for all the speeches, events and acrimony on all sides of the debate -- and for all the twists and turns that have marked the past six months -- even diehard political junkies like Hanson say it is nearly impossible to predict how this political saga will unfold. ""I wake up every morning and there are surprises,"" Hanson said. ""So I'm not sure at all, where we'll be six months from now, or one year or two years.""","A tent city has sprung up in Madison in what progressives are calling Walkerville .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Department of Veterans Affairs unveiled new regulations Monday making it easier for men and women who served in the armed forces to receive benefits for post-traumatic stress disorder. Current department rules require veterans to document events like firefights or bomb explosions that could have caused the disorder. Such documentation was often time-consuming and difficult, and sometimes was impossible. Under the new rules a veteran only needs to demonstrate that he or she served in a war and performed a job during which events could have happened that could cause the disorder. ""With this new PTSD regulation, we are acknowledging the inherently stressful nature of the places and circumstances of military service, in which the reality and fear of hostile or terrorist activities is always present,"" said Michael Walcoff, the VA's acting undersecretary for benefits. The new rule ""will potentially benefit all veterans, regardless of their period of service and it is not limited to veterans with direct combat experience,"" he stressed. Wolcoff noted that over 400,000 veterans currently receive compensation benefits for PTSD. In his weekly address on Saturday, President Barack Obama called the change a ""long overdue step."" ""For years, many veterans with PTSD who have tried to seek benefits -- veterans of today's wars and earlier wars -- have often found themselves stymied. They've been required to produce evidence proving that a specific event caused their PTSD. And that practice has kept the vast majority of those with PTSD who served in non-combat roles, but who still waged war, from getting the care they need,"" Obama said. ""I don't think our troops on the battlefield should have to take notes to keep for a claims application. And I've met enough veterans to know that you don't have to engage in a firefight to endure the trauma of war. So we're changing the way things are done."" Under the new rules, no benefits will be passed along until a Veterans Affairs psychiatrist or psychologist confirms that a veteran actually suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. Department officials say that should reduce the risk of fraudulent claims. One congressional analysis reportedly put the cost of the new changes at $5 billion. Obama said the new process ""will help veterans not just of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, but generations of their brave predecessors who proudly served and sacrificed in all our wars."" ""It's a step that proves America will always be here for our veterans, just as they've been there for us. We won't let them down. We take care of our own,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Brazilian model Mariana Bridi da Costa, whose hands and feet were amputated in a bid to save her from a deadly and little-known illness, died early Saturday, two friends of the model told CNN. Brazilian model Mariana Bridi da Costa died Saturday after undergoing multiple amputations. ""Unfortunately Mari couldn't resist any longer. She passed away at 3 a.m. today,"" Henrique Fontes, executive director of Miss World Brazil, said in an e-mail to CNN. Renato Lindgren, a friend of the model who runs a blog dedicated to her, confirmed da Costa's death. On his blog, Lindgren wrote that he and other friends were going to the hospital. ""On behalf of all the family, we are grateful for the support and the affection that the entire world has sent to us,"" he wrote. Da Costa, 20, had fought a pernicious disease that has ravaged her body and forced doctors to perform the amputations and extract part of her stomach as well as both kidneys. She had been breathing through a respirator, officials at Dorio Silva Hospital in the Brazilian state of Espirito Santo said Friday. Da Costa suffered from necrosis, or the fast deadening of tissue, caused by septicemia. Septicemia, triggered by a bacterial infection, causes insufficient blood flow that can lead to organ failure. Da Costa first sought medical advice after feeling ill in late December. Hospital officials said she was transferred to Dorio Silva on January 3 in ""septic shock,"" a serious medical condition caused by an inflammation. Da Costa was first diagnosed as suffering a urinary tract infection. By the time the infection was detected, it had developed into septicemia. Doctors decided to amputate first her hands and then her feet after the condition reduced the amount of oxygen being delivered to her limbs. Just less than one month ago, da Costa was a healthy young woman well on the way to achieving her dream of becoming a world class model. She placed sixth in the Miss Bikini International competition in China last year and took first place for the ""Best in Swimsuit"" category. In 2007 and 2008, she came fourth in the contest to become Brazil's entrant for the Miss World pageant. Thiago Simoes, da Costa's fiance, said she was on her way to international stardom, signing with prominent model scout Dilson Stein, who brought Brazilian models, including Gisele Bundchen and Luize Altenhofen, to the world stage. ""All the agencies were very interested in knowing her. I know for a fact that they would have loved her because Mariana is beautiful,"" Stein told Brazil's Tribuna newspaper. Simoes told CNN that da Costa woke up from a coma 10 days ago and told him how much she wanted to be alive. ""She told me she was praying to stay alive, that she still had a lot to do on this earth, that she wanted to go on with her plans,"" he said. ""She comes from a humble family and she was the main breadwinner,"" said Simoes, who refuted rumors that da Costa was dieting and that might have affected her health. ""She never dieted, never took pills...she is a very simple, very warm human being,"" he said. A doctor who recently published an article in The New England Journal of Medicine on the disease, told CNN that little was known about the illness, although it is the tenth leading cause of deaths in the United States. ""We know a lot about what happens once a patient contracts the illness but we know very little about what causes it,"" said Dr. Greg Martin of Emory University in Atlanta. Martin said sepsis is a ""response"" to an infection that can cause the immune system to lose its balance. ""Basically, the immune system goes haywire after contracting an infection and begins to overreact,"" he said. Men are more susceptible than women, Martin said. News of da Costa's condition spread quickly throughout Brazil and then worldwide. A message on her Web site said that the volume of traffic had caused it to crash, and that the site had received more than 15,000 hits in two days. ""The whole world, I repeat, the whole world is touched by the case of Mariana,"" it said. The message said they had received ""e-mails of solidarity from all corners of the world: Australia, Ukraine, Czech Republic, France, Italy, USA, Russia, etc."" CNN's Hilary Whiteman and Helena de Moura contributed to this report.","NEW: Brazilian amputee model Mariana Bridi da Costa died early Saturday .

"(CNN) -- Scientists say they ""serendipitously"" discovered that a drug used to treat a type of cancer quickly reversed Alzheimer's disease in mice. ""It's really exciting,"" said Maria Carrillo, senior director for medical and scientific relations for the Alzheimer's Association. ""They saw very positive and robust behavior effects in the mice."" In the study, researchers at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine gave mice mega-doses of bexarotene, a drug used to treat a type of skin cancer called cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Within 72 hours, the mice showed dramatic improvements in memory and more than 50% of amyloid plaque -- a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease -- had been removed from the brain. The study was published Thursday in the journal Science. Gary Landreth, the lead researcher at Case Western, cautioned that even though his results were impressive in mice, it may turn out not to work in people. ""I want to say as loudly and clearly as possible that this was a study in mice, not in humans,"" he said. ""We've fixed Alzheimer's in mice lots of times, so we need to move forward expeditiously but cautiously."" Mice -- and humans -- with Alzheimer's have high levels of a substance called amyloid beta in their brain. Pathology tests on the mice showed bexarotene lowered the levels of amyloid beta and raised the levels of apolipoprotein E, which helps keep amyloid beta levels low. Landreth said he hopes to try the drug out in healthy humans within two months, to see if it has the same effect. Those participating in the trial would be given the standard dose that cancer patients are usually given. Researchers tested the memories of mice with Alzheimer's both before and after giving them bexarotene. For example, the Alzheimer's mice walked right into a cage where they'd previously been given a painful electrical shock, but after treatment with bexarotene, the mice remembered the shock and refused to enter the cage. In another test, the scientists put tissue paper in a cage. Normal mice instinctively use tissues in their cage to make a nest, but mice with Alzheimer's can't figure out what to do with the tissues. After treatment with the drug, the Alzheimer's mice made a nest with the paper. Carrillo said one of the major advantages of bexarotene is that it's already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in humans, which means the researchers can move into human trials sooner than if it were a completely new drug. The Alzheimer's Association is funding Case Western's next phase of research, which will involve using bexarotene at the levels used on cancer patients, Landreth said. Since the drug does have some side effects -- it can increase cholesterol, for example -- he hopes to use it in even lower levels as the study goes on. Landreth said his lab had been working on other drugs for Alzheimer's for 10 years when a graduate student, Paige Cramer, decided to try bexarotene, which works on a receptor involved in amyloid beta clearance. Some other drugs that worked in mice were too toxic to use in humans. ""We're really lucky that bexarotene is a great drug with an acceptable safety profile,"" he said. ""This doesn't happen very many times in life'"" CNN's William Hudson contributed to this report.","""They saw very positive and robust ... effects in the mice,"" an Alzheimer's official says .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The historic days when Britain was frequently troubled by marauding, ransom-seeking Scandinavian invaders resulted in a rueful proverb ""Once you have paid the Dane-geld you'll never get rid of the Dane."" It is a proverb which should be noted by governments thinking of bailing out troubled automobile companies. Despite a vociferous campaign by workers MG Rover failed to survive. As the U.S. authorities contemplate how to respond to pleas for help from the ""Big Three"" -- GM, Ford and Chrysler-- they might pause to reflect on the experiences of past British governments when they tried to help the troubled British Leyland group in its various historical forms. The British Leyland Motor Company, BLMC, was formed back in 1968. It was a merger promoted by the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation set up by the 1964-70 Labour government of Harold Wilson. But weakened by such developments as the 1973 oil crisis, Britain's Three Day Week and the industrial militancy of the times, the group struggled to compete and was part-nationalized in 1975. With car, truck and bus manufacturers and other varied interests, the group at one time held some 40 per cent of the British car market. But although it had such prestigious marques as Jaguar, Rover and Land Rover and introduced the innovative and best-selling Mini, the group had an incoherent product range, was slow to develop new models to cope with international competition and frequently had to go cap in hand to the government. When Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979 she knew that how her government tackled what was effectively a state-controlled industry would have a crucial effect on the morale and practice of British industry and managers. She wanted to back the company's chief Michael Edwardes in fighting trades union militancy. But she and her ministers found that commercial needs and political realities frequently collided. Tell us what you think . She was determined to confront the unions and to cut back on state subsidies. But in no time she found even a chairman she admired and who shared her objectives coming to her asking for further supplements to the £1 billion previously pledged to the ailing company by the previous Labour government. With the company's employees due to be balloted on a painful re-structuring plan there was a danger that if they said no there would be a forced liquidation. As Thatcher recorded in her memoirs ""The economic consequences of such a collapse were appalling. One hundred and fifty thousand people were employed by the company in the UK."" There were an equal number of jobs in the component industries dependent on Leyland and it was calculated that closure would cost the British balance of trade £2 billion a year. In an insight into the dilemmas faced by many governments now, the former prime minister noted: ""Closure would have some awful consequences. But we must never give the impression that it was unthinkable. If ever the company and its workforce came to believe that there would be no end to their demands on the public purse."" She refused to guarantee BL's debts but even so the ballot was successful. Then the company asked for government backing, and money, to implement its corporate plan. Thatcher was skeptical, commenting ""BL's annual plans always forecast major improvement but every year things seemed to get worse..."" The company's share of the UK car market had slumped from 35 to 16 percent. Thatcher had her ministers comb through the company accounts and they concluded that the plan was likely to fail. But in the end BL got government backing and money because, as she put it: ""People simply would not understand liquidation of the company at the very moment when its management was standing up to the unions and talking the language of hard commercial commonsense."" Things did not get any better. BL's management was reluctant to sell the company or to let the government engage an independent adviser on the disposal of its assets. Amid a worldwide recession there were more wage claims, more strikes and Thatcher lectured the company and the industry on its poor productivity and over-readiness to strike. As she acknowledged, ""On any rational commercial judgement, there were no good reasons for continuing to fund British Leyland.""  Watch iReporters on the bailout » . Thatcher wanted out of government involvement in the industry, or at least a middle way with a partial selloff. But no deal was struck. With ministers growing increasingly nervous about the unemployment prospects if the company went under, a re-structuring plan was finally agreed. As she admitted: ""The political realities had to be faced. BL had to be supported ... and, most painfully, we provided £900 million."" Thatcher and her ministers claimed that there was a long-term change in attitude from British Leyland workers. But they regretted that the huge extra sums they were forced to provide came from the taxpayer or, because they were forced to raise interest rates, from other businesses. ""Every vociferous cheer for higher public spending was matched by a silent groan from those who had to pay for it."" Some jobs were saved, for a while. But did the British taxpayer get value for money? It seems very doubtful. After various re-configurations the BL Group, by then renamed MG Rover, went bankrupt in 2005, bringing to an end mass car production by British-owned manufacturers. MG became part of a Chinese group, Jaguar and Land Rover were sold on by Ford in 2008 to TATA Motors of India.","UK governments spent billions trying to help troubled British Leyland group .

"(CNN) -- Phillip Garrido was sentenced Thursday to 431 years to life in prison in the kidnapping and sexual assault of Jaycee Dugard, who was held captive from age 11 to 29 by Garrido and his wife, according to the El Dorado County, California, district attorney's office. His wife, Nancy Garrido, 55, was sentenced earlier in the day to 36 years to life in prison for her role in the abduction and rape, said Garrido's attorney, Stephen Tapson. Dugard didn't appear in court Thursday for the sentencings, but she submitted an emotional statement that was presented by her mother, according to Dugard's media representative, Nancy Seltzer. Jaycee Dugard, now 31, called the Garridos ""evil"" and described their captivity of her as a ""sexual perversion"" forced upon her for 18 years. A statement by Dugard's mother, Terry Probyn, was also read in court. The Garridos, a married couple, pleaded guilty in late April in El Dorado County Superior Court to charges of kidnapping and sexual assault. Dugard was abducted from the street in front of her home in South Lake Tahoe, California, in 1991. Authorities found her in 2009. During those years, the Garridos held Dugard in a hidden compound on their home's grounds in Antioch, California. She bore two daughters, fathered by Phillip Garrido. Dugard's written statement, presented during Phillip Garrido's sentencing, was lengthy. ""I chose not to be here today because I refuse to waste another second of my life in your presence. I've chosen to have my mom read this for me,"" Dugard wrote. ""Phillip Garrido, you are wrong. I could never say that to you before, but I have the freedom now and I am saying you are a liar and all of your so-called theories are wrong. Everything you have ever done to me has been wrong and someday I hope you can see that. ""What you and Nancy did was reprehensible. You always justified everything to suit yourself but the reality is and always has been that to make someone else suffer for your inability to control yourself and for you, Nancy, to facilitate his behavior and trick young girls for his pleasure is evil. There is no God in the universe that would condone your actions,"" Dugard said. ""To you, Phillip, I say that I have always been a thing for your own amusement. I hated every second of every day of 18 years because of you and the sexual perversion you forced on me,"" she continued. ""To you, Nancy, I have nothing to say. ""Both of you can save your apologies and empty words. For all the crimes you have both committed I hope you have as many sleepless nights as I did. ""Yes, as I think of all of those years I am angry because you stole my life and that of my family. Thankfully I am doing well now and no longer live in a nightmare. I have wonderful friends and family around me. Something you can never take from me again. You do not matter any more,"" Dugard wrote. In her own statement to the court, Dugard's mother recounted June 10, 1991, the day her daughter was abducted. ""I begged, I pleaded, I cried, I ranted and raved, I went crazy and thought I was going to go insane,"" Probyn said in her statement. ""My baby was gone and all of my dreams turned to nightmares. Dreadful nightmarish thoughts of her bondage and of her suffering. ""For 18 excruciating years, I endured a huge gaping hole in my heart that some evil being had put their hand into and had ripped out. For 18 agonizing years, I guarded what little I had left and lived in hell on this earth,"" Probyn wrote. The mother condemned the Garridos. ""I hate you both for the torment and anguish you put my daughter, myself, and my family through. I am nauseous at the thought of the sexual exploitation and the brutal abuse she endured at your uncaring hand. I am sickened by the reality that she had to suffer your cruel and heartless imprisonment for so long. You are the epitome of disgust and no amount of jail time or even death will cleanse your corrupt souls. You do not deserve to live or die or even exist,"" Probyn's statement said. ""You are nothing...other than selfish, self serving, self gratifying monsters,"" the mother said. She added that the Garridos will never see Jaycee Dugard's two daughters again. ""Her daughters know what you did to their mother. They realize your backyard was a prison and understand your filthy, despicable secret. They are aware that they have been deceived and I am here to tell you that there is no love lost,"" the mother's statement to the court said. Jaycee Dugard's maternal aunt, Tina Dugard, also provided a statement to the court in which she said her mother, Onita, died of ""a broken heart"" because of Jaycee Dugard's abduction. ""Jaycee was the center of my mom's world, as only a first grandchild can be. Facing life without her beloved Jaycee was more than my mom could handle. I wish she had found the strength to live for me, for my brothers and sisters, and for her other grandchildren. But she couldn't. Losing Jaycee was simply devastating, and she just couldn't recover,"" Tina Dugard's statement said. Phillip Garrido was a registered sex offender on parole at the time of his arrest. California law doesn't provide for a death penalty for the offenses committed by the Garridos, District Attorney Vern Pierson said in April. Phillip Garrido, 60, pleaded guilty to one count of kidnapping and 13 counts of sexual assault, Pierson said. He has waived his right to appeal, the district attorney said. Nancy Garrido, 55, pleaded guilty to one count of kidnapping and one count of rape by force, and to California's ""one strike"" rape law, Pierson said. Her sentence is the maximum possible based on the sentencing laws in effect in 1991, he said. Nancy Garrido also has waived her right to appeal, prosecutors said. Her plea was offered contingent on Phillip Garrido pleading guilty and waiving his right to appeal, prosecutors said. .","Dugard's statement to court calls the Garridos ""evil""

"(CNN) -- U.S. kidnapping victim Jaycee Dugard, who gave birth to two children during her 18 years in captivity, said she did what she had to do to survive. During a wide-ranging interview with ABC News' Diane Sawyer that aired Sunday night, Dugard opened up about her experiences at the hands of her captors, Nancy and Philip Garrido. Dugard was just 11 years old when she was abducted in 1991 from the street in front of her South Lake Tahoe, California, home. The Garridos held her and her daughters in a hidden compound of sheds and tarpaulins until she was found in 2009. Dugard is now 31 and working to build a new life, one in which she and her children are finally free. ""There's a switch that I had to shut off,"" she told Sawyer. ""Just went someplace else."" ""I can't imagine being beaten to death, you know? And you can't imagine being kidnapped and raped, you know? So, it's just, you just do what you have to do to survive."" Dugard recounted the first moment Phillip Garrido entered her life. She was on her way to school, wearing her favorite shirt and a ring in the shape of a butterfly her mother had given her, ABC reported, when all of a sudden Dugard felt ""tingly"" and ""numb."" Phillip Garrido had shocked her with a stun gun, the network said. The Garridos then put her in their car. She recalled Phillip Garrido laughing at one point, and telling his wife: ""I can't believe we got away with it."" ""It was like the most horrible moment of your life times 10,"" Dugard told ABC. At first, she was handcuffed. Dugard said she tried not to cry because, with her hands behind her back, she couldn't wipe away her tears. Left on her face, they would itch, she said. Dugard also recalled the first time she gave birth, in the backyard, at just 14 years old. ""I didn't know I was in labor,"" she said. ""Then I saw her. She was beautiful. I felt like I wasn't alone anymore. (I) had somebody that was mine ... And I knew I could never let anything happen to her,"" she said. Throughout her 18-year ordeal, Dugard managed to hold onto the ring her mother had given her and the hope that she would one day be reunited with her family, ABC reported. ""I wanted to see her more than anything,"" she said about her mother. ""I would cry every day. (It was) hardest when I would think about her and what she was doing and then -- trying to convince myself she was better without me. ""Worried I'd forget what she looked like, or what she sounded like. Would she forget me?"" Her mother, Terry Probyn, also appeared in the ABC interview. Last month, a judge sentenced Phillip Garrido to 431 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to one count of kidnapping and 12 counts of sexual assault. Nancy Garrido got 36 years to life in prison for her role in the crimes, including kidnapping and one count of rape by force. The couple pleaded guilty in late April in El Dorado Superior Court. A statement from Dugard, read by her mother at the sentencing hearing, called the Garridos ""evil"" and described her kidnapping by them as a ""sexual perversion."" During the ABC interview, she stressed she is moving on with her life. Dugard said she wants to study writing, the network reported. She spoke out just days before her memoir, ""A Stolen Life,"" is scheduled to be released. The book is due in stores Tuesday. ""Why not look at it? Stare it down until it can't scare you anymore,"" Dugard said about her nearly two decades in captivity.

"(CNN) -- Should Mexican drug cartels be considered terrorist organizations? They murder, plot, kidnap, and dismember bodies. They're also responsible for shootouts, explosions, fires and other atrocities. U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, the chairman of the Homeland Security Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, says they should. McCaul has introduced a bill that would add Mexico's six dominant cartels to the State Department's foreign terrorist organizations list. The criminal organizations included in the bill are the Arellano Felix organization, Los Zetas, Beltran Leyva, Familia Michoacana, Sinaloa Cartel, and the Gulf Cartel/New Federation. If the bill is approved, it would allow law enforcement agencies to have increased powers to limit cartels' financial property and travel interests and impose harsher punishments on anyone who provides material support to cartels. In announcing his bill, McCaul said that ""the [Mexican] cartels use violence to gain political and economic influence. They have taken control of much of northern Mexico and spillover crime has resulted in the abandonment of property and loss of security on the U.S. side of the border."" Read more about Mexican drug cartel violence . But the bill has ruffled some feathers in the Mexican government. After the Dallas Morning News supported it on a recent editorial, Mexican Ambassador to the U.S. Arturo Sarukhan fired back in a letter to the newspaper's editor. In the letter, Sarukhan says that ""if you label these organizations as terrorist, you will have to start calling drug consumers in the U.S. 'financiers of terrorist organizations' and gun dealers 'providers of material support to terrorists.'"" ""Otherwise,"" the ambassador wrote, ""you really sound as if you want to have your cake and eat it too."" At a House Judiciary Committee hearing on March 16, FBI Director Robert Mueller expressed concern about the danger posed by the cartels. ""The extreme violence across our Southwest border continues to impact the United States as we saw the murders last March of American consulate workers in Juarez, Mexico and the shooting last month of two U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Mexico,"" Mueller said. Consular employee Lesley Enriquez and her husband Arthur Redelfs were shot and killed in Juarez, Mexico by gangs affiliated with a drug cartel, according to Mexican authorities. ICE agent Jaime Zapata was killed and another agent injured in February when they were ambushed on a highway in central Mexico. It has not been clarified if this was a case of mistaken identity or if criminals targeted the agents traveling from the northern Mexican city of Monterrey to Mexico City, where they were based. The concern about Mexican drug cartels has also been expressed by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano. At a U.S. Senate Committee hearing on March 9, Napolitano said that the U.S. government remains ""very concerned about drug cartel violence in Mexico and we must vigorously guard against potential spillover effects into the United States."" Mexican officials have repeatedly said that drug cartels are neither an insurgency nor terrorist organizations because their purpose is neither to destabilize the government nor promote a political ideology. Their level of cruelty is unprecedented, but they don't hate a particular group. Their only motive, Mexican authorities say, is hard, cold cash.","Texas Republican wants cartels declared terrorist organizations .

"(CNN) -- When Iraq war veteran Angela Peacock is in the shower, she sometimes closes her eyes and can't help reliving the day in Baghdad in 2003 that pushed her closer to the edge. Sgt. Angela Peacock is seen in 2004, after she returned to the United States from duty in Iraq. While pulling security detail for an Army convoy stuck in gridlocked traffic, Peacock's vehicle came alongside a van full of Iraqi men who ""began shouting that they were going to kill us,"" she said. One man in the vehicle was particularly threatening. ""I can remember his eyes looking at me,"" she said. ""I put my finger on the trigger and aimed my weapon at the guy, and my driver is screaming at me to stop."" ""I was really close to shooting at them, but I didn't."" Now back home in Missouri, Peacock, 30, is unemployed -- living in a friend's home in North St. Louis County without a lease and paying minimal rent. She points to the Baghdad confrontation as a major contributor to her struggles with drug abuse and post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. She says she's one step away from living on the street.  See details on vets, including homeless » . Shortly after her discharge in 2004, Peacock said, she developed an addiction to pain pills. After her husband left her, she was evicted from her apartment, which she said made it impossible for her to obtain a lease or a mortgage. She spent the next few years ""couch surfing"" from friend to friend, relative to relative.  Watch how Los Angeles helps its 15,000 homeless vets » . ""I could be kicked out of this house at any time,"" she said. Experts say that Peacock's profile is similar to that of many female veterans returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In fact, the rate of female homeless vets is increasing in the United States, according to the federal government and groups that advocate for homeless people. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs defines PTSD as a type of anxiety that affects people who've experienced a particularly traumatic event that creates intense fear, helplessness or horror. ""You're sitting on your couch and you hear a car go down the street, and you think it's going to come through your house -- so you kind of catastrophize things automatically,"" Peacock said. ""That's stuff normal people don't do, but if you're in a combat zone on convoys all the time, you can't help but do that."" People in Peacock's life ""just don't get it,"" she said, ""so you just isolate."" PTSD can trigger depression, experts say, leading to job loss and a rapid downward spiral toward homelessness. Many times, these newly homeless women also have children to care for, advocates say. Making matters worse, Peacock and other returning vets from Iraq and Afghanistan have been hammered by a struggling economy and skyrocketing unemployment rates. The jobless rate for post-9/11 veterans is higher than the overall U.S. rate and has nearly doubled in the past year to 11.3 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In addition, about 1.5 million veterans -- 6.3 percent -- had incomes below the federal poverty line, according to a 2005 congressional analysis of census figures. With the U.S. Army now at 15 percent female, and more women providing supporting roles in combat zones, female vets are becoming homeless at a faster rate than men, said Department of Veterans Affairs spokesman Pete Dougherty. Conservative estimates count about 131,000 homeless veterans in the United States, most of them from the Vietnam War era. The VA has pinpointed 3,717 homeless veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, but the nationwide total could be as many as twice that -- about 7,400, he said. The VA estimates about 10 percent of all homeless veterans are women, making the estimated number of homeless Iraq-Afghanistan female veterans about 740. Dougherty said that number is rising. Peacock blames her PTSD on many incidents during her time in the military, including ""a bunch of small near misses, like sniper fire on a convoy, and waiting for somebody to throw an IED over, and the constant fear that I'm going to die."" She also says she was raped by a noncommissioned officer while deployed in South Korea in 2001. She said that on the advice of a soldier who outranked her, she never officially reported the rape. ""He said if you tell, they're going to put you on trial and make you look like a party girl,"" she said. Peacock said the Army reached out to her to investigate the rape accusation, but she refused to cooperate because she didn't think the investigation would do any good. CNN.com contacted the Army about Peacock's story and has not yet received an official response to her allegations. Known in the ranks as MST, military sexual trauma is another factor homeless advocates point to as a possible cause for PTSD. To fight the problem, some communities are developing outreach systems to catch homeless women vets before they fall too far. Tracking veterans and determining early on when they've lost jobs and are about to lose their housing has met with some success, said Steve Berg, vice president of programs and policy at the National Alliance to End Homelessness. At-risk vets would get immediate assistance, said Berg, such as help negotiating with a landlord or finding a new job or short-term financial assistance. iReport.com: Ask a veteran about his or her greatest concerns . Another idea that has had some success, according to Berg, is called the rapid rehousing approach -- identifying veterans when they first show up at a homeless shelter. ""If you help them get right back into housing, you get better results than if you let people stay homeless for a long time and then try to fix them,"" Berg said. Now heading the VA is Eric Shinseki, the Army four-star general who retired in 2003, shortly after angering some Bush administration officials by telling a Senate panel that more troops were needed to pacify Iraq after the invasion. Shinseki has vowed to end homelessness among veterans within five years. Funds totaling $75 million from the VA and the Department of Housing and Urban Development in 2008 made vouchers available for 10,000 units of permanent housing for homeless vets in all 50 states. Shinseki has announced another $75 million in June aimed at providing another 10,000 homes. ""They're good programs,"" Berg said, ""but they don't have a big enough capacity."" Theoretically, if $75 million a year gets 10,000 veterans off the streets and into homes, it could be possible to house all 131,000 homeless veterans with about $975 million, Dougherty said. The Senate is considering legislation to provide care and services for homeless veterans with children. Cosponsored by Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, the bill would authorize $50 million in VA special needs grants over five years. Peacock, who has no children herself, says she's been sober for three years. Determined to ""heal her demons,"" she says she's working on a 12-step addiction program and receiving hourlong sessions each week with a VA therapist. Peacock also said she takes part in a VA vocational rehabilitation program that has provided her with a dog she named GI Joe. ""Well -- his name was already Joe -- I added the 'GI,' "" she laughed. Eventually, she plans to return to college, become a ""transpersonal psychologist"" and help others with PTSD. ""It's like spiritual psychology,"" Peacock explained. ""You explore your place in the world and your place in life."" Her plan is ""to save myself first, and then I can help somebody else."" ""I'm getting there,"" Peacock said. ""It's kind of slow, but I'm clean and sober and I have a new support circle and I'm in my hometown again. It's definitely better, and I'm not done yet.""","VA: Percentage of homeless female veterans growing faster than male veterans .

"(CNN) -- A Florida judge's ruling Wednesday will allow a foreign-born high school basketball player who was ruled ineligible and his team to compete in the playoffs, even though they could ultimately be stripped of any title they win. Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Spencer Eig temporarily barred the Florida High School Athletic Association from disqualifying Brian Delancy, who was born in the Bahamas, and Dr. Michael M. Krop Senior High School from the district playoffs, which begin Thursday. Delancy ""is very happy and relieved and he feels happy for his teammates,"" said attorney David Baron, who helped represent the athlete, 19, and two other players. The board of the athletic association, which said Krop did not file proper paperwork on Delancy's eligibility and immigration status, on Tuesday ruled he was ineligible and that the top-ranked team must forfeit the 19 games it won when the senior guard played. Eig did not rule on Delancy's eligibility, but granted a temporary injunction to allow Krop to play until a full slate of hearings and appeals can take place within the athletic association, . Roger Dearing, the association's executive director, said it was too late to appeal Eig's ruling and Krop will compete. But, he said, the ruling is not the end of the matter. Dearing said the association will hear new appeals after the tournament, likely in April. Now that Krop is in the playoffs, North Miami High School will be bumped from the four-team field in the district playoffs, Dearing said. ""There is no win for kids here,"" said Dearing. ""What about the schools that played fair?"" Alan Goldfarb, another attorney for Delancy, said it was unfortunate about North Miami, but the school would not have made the playoffs if the athletic association had not ruled Krop ineligible. Goldfarb said the association only recently decided to act. ""There's no proof yet that we've done anything wrong,"" Goldfarb said. Dearing said Krop reported the paperwork issue last week and sought the emergency board appeal. Federal law prohibits school districts from asking about a student's immigration status. The Florida athletic association does require information on players' eligibility and residency. The association keeps such records so that ""there is a fair and equitable playing field for all student athletes"" and to discourage recruiting, association spokesman Seth Polansky said Tuesday. Where athletes come from ""is not an issue,"" he said. ""It is the paperwork."" ""Playing athletics is a privilege and not a right,"" said Polansky, adding that it is up to schools to police themselves on student eligibility. Baron said Delancy first attended a private school, which required an I-20 form. An I-20 is a student visa that gives international students permission to attend school. But Delancy or Krop were not required to provide such a form when he transferred to Krop, a public school, Baron said Tuesday. Dearing said public schools must have such student visa forms and that Delancy's form had expired. Although the athletic association board ruled Delancy ineligible and vacated the school's wins, its decision did not keep Krop out of the playoffs, said Polansky. Each district in Florida decides independently how its sports teams will advance in the post-season. The emergency petition that was taken before Eig argued the athletic association never set a hearing or requested information from Delancy before making a ""unilateral"" determination on his eligibility. Dearing disagreed. ""We have due process in every rule in our book,"" he said, adding it was Krop that asked for a waiver of the normal appeals process in order to get a ruling from the full board. Baron argues Delancy has always been forthright with the school on his background and should not have to prove his legal status to play. The athletic association believes Krop is being ""disingenuous"" about its knowledge and compliance with rules, Dearing said. The school was walked through proper paperwork last year because of another case involving international students, he said. The executive director said the athletic association must ensure rules are met. Baron said he knows that Krop could win it all and then lose the crown if the athletic association ultimately decides Delancy was ineligible and the wins should be forfeited. ""These kids are only concerned about playing for the championship,"" he said.","NEW: High school basketball player from Bahamas can play, judge says .

"(CNN) -- Sweety High co-founder Veronica Zelle remembers a young girl who wanted desperately to sing and share her voice, but was so afraid to show her face on camera that she would cover it with a dark towel and sing in the background. But through the encouraging words of her friends and peers on Sweety High, an online community exclusively for tween and teen girls, she was able to pull back the curtain and showcase her face and voice in tandem. It's a social gaming site that combines aspects of a site like Facebook with a call to be creative in an environment that includes contests with rewards and points. Stories like this make Zelle grateful she helped create a safe online haven for under-served tween and teen girls. Her business model is simple: Ask young girls what they want and give it to them. Throw in innovative privacy and safety moderation systems to restrict cyberbullying and online predators, and Mom and Dad are happy to let their young daughter become a ""sweetie."" Privo and Crisp Thinking are two companies that have paired with Sweety High to offer state of the art safety. They moderate all user-generated content, while Sweety High staff work with child psychologists and online law enforcement officers to ensure a continually secure environment. Nonusers can't view anything on the site, which helps prevent predators. Joining the site is free, and for $5.95 a month, a Sweety High Membership Badge allows more access. Sweety High caters to girls between 8 and 16 and wraps ""social gaming mechanics around an arts platform,"" CEO and co-founder Frank Simonetti said. Instead of relying on animated avatars like Disney's Club Penguin site or the minimalist utilitarian style of Facebook, Simonetti and Zelle wanted Sweety High to be an online destination for girls to express their creativity -- and be rewarded for it. ""I made this site a girls-only site because when girls are together in a creative environment, nine out of 10 times, the girls are going to encourage each other,"" she said. ""Take those same girls, add boys in, and they're going to be different. Their very posturing and reactions differ. That's where bullying comes from. At 12 or 13, girls don't know how to behave around boys and they act out of self-reliance."" The two founders compare the site's mission to the talent development featured in the movie ""Fame,"" although instead of being a prestigious school for the arts, Sweety High is available for everyone. But girls are still singing their hearts out in the corridors of this idyllic online school. Ironically, hearts are the currency that girls earn as they navigate the levels of Sweety High's social gaming platform. When they vote for another girl in a contest or support her creativity, they give up one of their hearts, which creates a karma bank that can lead to impressive prizes down the road. ""We saw tons of girls that, from ages 10 to 14, are exploding with creativity and talent,"" Simonetti said. ""There didn't seem to be something that felt good for them on the Web. This is an arts and entertainment destination that is focused on their lives, rather than an avatar's life. We reward online creativity with offline rewards."" Sweeties upload writing, artwork, photography and videos that showcase their talent and the rewards are a dream come true for teens and tweens. Thirteen-year-old pianist Annie shared her musical talents in a video posted on Sweety High. She won the grand prize in a contest that allowed her to spend the day with musician Greyson Chance and be a part of one of his performances. While the opportunity was incredible for Annie, she said she's also happy to have discovered a safe destination online where she can connect with like-minded girls and express herself without fear of harsh judgment or criticism. This is especially meaningful for Annie because before Sweety High, she wasn't allowed to have a Facebook or e-mail account for fear of cyberbullying. Now, Annie posts videos that she makes with her friends and is learning to play guitar. ""It encourages me to be myself, keep posting whatever kind of videos I want on there and maybe try out new things to see what other people think about it,"" Annie said. ""I know that whatever I try, there's always going to be positive feedback, so I'm never going to feel like I need to stop being who I am."" For her mother, Karen, it's a safe place for Annie to explore opportunities while remaining safe. Sweety High allows parents the ability to monitor their daughters' accounts if they are under 13 without moms or dads having an overarching presence on the site. They can screen friend requests, while Sweety High staff monitor the online dialogue so it doesn't turn to vulgarity or bullying. Together, these efforts create an atmosphere of proper netiquette early on for tweens and teens to use later in life. ""What I like as a mom of a daughter is that she has an opportunity to really shine and grow in a lot of different directions"" Karen said. ""These girls are free to just be 12 or 13 and not feel like they have to be perfect. You can figure out what you like to do and get strength and confidence in yourself."" This is music to Simonetti and Zelle's ears. Both of Simonetti's parents were writers, but he couldn't imagine how to become one as a boy. ""Let girls take a shot at these things that a lot of them only dream about,"" he said. Sweety High's beta site, which launched last month, already has upwards of 170,000 members and the site hopes for at least 1 million registered users in the next six months. Some of Sweety High's 100,000 alum from when the site began in 2010 have signed on with television shows and major labels or simply felt encouraged to join the marching band in high school, Simonetti said. Contests on the site, like ""Be A Star,"" encourage girls to ""discover and be discovered."" Winning contests may connect the girls with contacts in the entertainment industry who can lead to even better opportunities. Current members and alums also watch and have the chance to become part of the seven Web video series Sweety High maintains, including the latest, ""Food Star."" Teens and tweens are fans of food shows like ""Cupcake Wars"" on TV, but Simonetti and Zelle noticed there isn't a show on TV geared specifically to this young market. ""Food Star"" invites a popular teen star to share his or her favorite recipe, along with slices of life as a celebrity, with two Sweety High members hosting. The landscape of Sweety High continues to grow and change as feedback rolls in. Zelle maintains an account on the site and interacts with the girls daily, always taking note of what they want to see next. After working in the entertainment industry with the likes of Britney Spears, Madonna and Justin Timberlake, Zelle has an idea of what girls want, but it means constantly listening and interacting with the sweeties, something Zelle regards as her greatest joy. ""Those girls are like my lifeblood,"" she said. ""I don't know anything else but the tween/teen space because I went from being a teenager to college to working in youth culture in the teen space, so I have literally arrested my development at age 14. I think the reason I work so well with the girls is because I find out what they want and I can only do that when I speak their language."" By encouraging girls to embrace their full potential, granting wish fulfillment and inspiring future aspirations on Sweety High, Zelle believes girls will feel empowered to the point that nothing could discourage them. ""Girl power isn't over,"" she said. ""It's just reinventing itself."" Last names were removed to maintain the privacy of Sweety High's members.","Sweety High is a social gaming site for tween and teen girls between ages 8 and 16 .

"(CNN) -- You already have your next credit card. It's sitting in your front pocket. People have possessed the ability to spend and send money with their smartphones for years, but mobile payments have yet to take off in a big way. Plastic and cash are still the preferred modes of buying stuff -- by a long shot. But four recent events suggest that mobile payments are about to take off in a big way. 1. This week, investors pumped $150 million into Square, the mobile-payments company that lets people turn their smartphones into virtual cash registers. The investment values the company at $6 billion. 2. Last week, eBay opted to spin off payments service PayPal. A big part of the reason: PayPal has been held back by its parent company, and the move is expected to free PayPal to increase its mobile payments presence. 3. Facebook is experimenting with a one-touch payments system, and this week TechCrunch reported that Facebook is about to release a peer-to-peer money transfer feature in its Messenger app. 4. And then there's the big kahuna: Apple Pay. Set to be released later this month, Apple Pay will let iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users make payments at participating retailers simply by using their phones' fingerprint scanner then holding the phone up to a scanner. Retailers who have already signed up include Bloomingdale's, Macy's, McDonald's, Staples, Walgreens and Whole Foods Market. More than 70% of U.S. adults have smartphones, and more than one in five have already used a ""mobile wallet"" in the past 90 days, according to Mary Monahan, executive vice president and research director at Javelin Strategy. More than half of mobile purchasers bought physical goods with their phones. The trend lines are clear. And as more apps and smartphones push mobile payments, consumers will become increasingly willing to ditch plastic for their phones. ""Recent history would dictate that pretty much anything that has required a physical world medium for delivery -- CDs, film cameras, the Encyclopedia Britannica -- have been all but replaced by a digital equivalent,"" said Nick Holland, a senior analyst at Javelin Strategy. What's not clear is which form of mobile payments will become dominant. Square, for instance, is hedging its bets by selling a credit card reader and a mobile app that lets you pay without taking your card out of your wallet. Although the company was a mobile-payments innovator, products like Apple's could make its most visible product, a reader for credit cards, obsolete. ""This won't happen for many years, but in a new world where Apple Pay is seen as the shiniest new thing -- where the plastic cards have the ability to be physically removed from the payment process -- Square has lost quite a lot of its sheen,"" Holland said. Monahan said she believes mobile users up to age 45 will make the transition to mobile payments relatively seamlessly. As to the others, she expects the transition to be slower, but to eventually come the same way other digital adoptions have -- with a nudge from the younger folks around them. ""Most likely, it will be the sons and daughters who sweet talk and cajole the parents ...."" she said. "" Dad -- I need the tuition check now, please. Just send it to me using mobile P2P."" ""That's how teens got parents to text -- just so parents could talk to their teens on the phone, they learned in self-defense. Now it's the next step.""","Experts say mobile-phone payments may be here to stay .

"(CNN) -- On the backs of iPods, iPhones and iPads, and on the bottom of Mac laptops, an inscription reads: ""Designed by Apple in California. Assembled in China."" The parts themselves come from more than 150 companies from various parts of the world. The majority of those antennas, glass, metal, sensors and silicon are manufactured overseas. How Apple finds parts and manufactures its products, almost entirely abroad, is standard protocol in the technology industry. Electronics companies say Asian manufacturing plants are more affordable and more versatile than those found anywhere else in the world. But as the most valuable tech company in the world, Apple is seen by many as a role model in business. And its reliance on cheap overseas labor -- most notably at factories in China run by manufacturer Foxconn -- has come under increased scrutiny in recent media coverage by CNN, The New York Times and other outlets. Foxconn, owned by Hon Hai Precision Industry, counts Apple among its business clients, which also include Amazon.com, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft and many other tech giants. Apple has reported violations at its facilities, and Foxconn has come under fire for a slew of worker suicides in 2010 and conditions that workers-rights groups say are inhumane. Workers at Foxconn and other plants in Asia must stay busy to keep up with the world's seemingly insatiable demand for Apple products. During the last three months of 2011, Apple sold 37 million iPhones, 15.4 million iPads, 15.4 million iPods and 5.2 million Mac computers, according to the company's financial report. That netted Apple $46.3 billion in revenue and $13.1 billion in profit, which is double what Apple made during the same period a year before. Where does all that profit come from? Take the iPhone, for example. The iPhone 4S sells for $199 if the customer signs a two-year cellular contract. But AT&T, Sprint Nextel and Verizon Wireless pay Apple much more for the phones in order to sell them at a lower price, a process called subsidizing. To get a so-called ""unlocked"" or contract-free iPhone, expect to pay at least $649 to Apple. The costs of parts and manufacturing for Apple's iPhone 4S is estimated to be $196, according to industry research firm IHS iSuppli. That's $453 less than Apple charges for a contract-free phone. Marketing and research can add up, but no matter which way you cut it, Apple is making a sizable profit on each phone it sells, said iSuppli analyst Tom Dinges. Apple has more than 60,000 employees, most of whom work in its retail stores. To build parts and assemble products, Apple has a long list of partners. That's partly done to avoid being dependent on any one manufacturer and to get favorable deals on each part from the many competing companies. Still, Apple tries to minimize the number of companies with which it signs deals, Dinges said. That way, Apple wields more influence because it's among the biggest-spending clients, he said. ""They'd rather be a mile deep in a supplier than divide the business up amongst five,"" Dinges said. ""You're going to take care of your biggest customers first."" In its supplier report, Apple says 156 companies account for 97% of the money spent on materials, manufacturing and assembly for its coveted gadgets. When the client is a powerhouse like Apple, winning a contract to be one of those 156 is a major event. In Wall Street parlance, it moves stock. Being anointed by Apple boosts a supplier's credibility, but Apple is a shrewd negotiator, from how it develops an iPad to how it leases or builds the retail store it's sold in. This reportedly forces Apple's partners to push workers and cut corners in order to wring profits. Apple told CNN in a statement that its expectations for suppliers to operate responsibly increase each year. Apple says it conducted 229 audits of suppliers last year and reported its findings publicly online. ""We care about every worker in our worldwide supply chain,"" Apple said in the statement. ""We insist that our suppliers provide safe working conditions, treat workers with dignity and respect, and use environmentally responsible manufacturing processes wherever Apple products are made. Our suppliers must live up to these requirements if they want to keep doing business with Apple.""","The parts and manufacturing for Apple products mostly happens overseas .

"(Health.com) -- People with Alzheimer's disease who continue taking the drug donepezil (Aricept) do get some benefit even as their symptoms worsen, a new study suggests. While the drug is approved for all stages of the memory-robbing disease, many people stop taking it. As a patient's memory and behavior problems get more severe, it can be hard to tell if the benefit of the treatment outweighs the risk of side effects, such as lack of appetite, weight loss, dizziness, and agitation. In general, Alzheimer's disease treatment can be a heartbreaking disappointment. The few drugs that are available tend to stop working over time, giving patients and families only a brief reprieve from the disease's relentless progression. Health.com: 25 signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease . In a new study of 295 people with an average age of 77 and moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's, those taking donepezil saw improvements ""equivalent to around four months' worth of deterioration in cognition and function,"" says lead study author Dr. Robert Howard, professor of old-age psychiatry at King's College London, U.K. Put another way, those who discontinued donepezil lost ""about a third more cognition over [one year] than they would have if they had stuck with it,"" says Gary Kennedy, M.D., director of geriatric psychiatry at Montefiore Medical Center in New York, who was not involved with the study. ""This may not sound like much, but to a patient with Alzheimer's disease at this point in their illness or their carers, any improvement in cognition or function that supports independence is valuable,"" Howard adds. Health.com: 7 ways to protect your memory . It's possible that in some cases, even this much of a benefit could mean the difference between staying at home and going into assisted living. About 5.4 million people in the U.S. have Alzheimer's disease, according to the Alzheimer's Association. Donepezil was also more effective than another common Alzheimer's drug, memantine (Namenda), in patients with later-stage disease, although memantine still showed some benefit, according to the study published this week in The New England Journal of Medicine. In general, Alzheimer's drugs are notoriously fickle, working relatively well for some, not as well for others, and not at all for some. ""In some people, drugs are effective for many months or even up to several years. Other people don't see any benefit. Other people are unable to take them because of side effects,"" says Heather M. Snyder, Ph.D., senior associate director of medical and scientific relations at the Alzheimer's Association. Health.com: 9 foods that may help save your memory . All of the patients included in this study were still living in communities (as opposed to nursing homes) in England and Scotland and all had been taking donepezil for about two to three years by the time they enrolled in the trial. The men and women were randomly assigned to one of four treatment strategies for one year: continue taking donepezil; stop taking donepezil and start taking an inactive placebo; substitute memantine for donepezil, or continue taking donepezil and memantine together. People who continued taking donepezil did better on two different scales of cognition and impairment than those taking no medication or those taking memantine alone. There was some evidence in the study that the improvements were actually noticeable to families and others. For example, people who were taking only an inactive placebo were more likely than patients in other groups to drop out of study, suggesting these families had noticed the placebo ""medication"" wasn't working. Health.com: Computer games that boost your memory . ""People [who discontinued] donepezil were much more likely to abandon the drug altogether, which implies that families picked up on the subtle effects of the drugs,"" notes Kennedy. Taking either memantine or donepezil alone was better than nothing at all, but taking them together offered no additional benefit. Although the combination of donepezil and memantine -- a common strategy in the U.S., but not the U.K. -- had no added benefit, each drug had ""independent positive effects,"" says Howard, who advises patients at this stage of the disease to continue taking both drugs if possible. Memantine, he says, ""has an additional benefit of preventing the emergence of symptoms like agitation, suspiciousness, and aggression."" However, Lon S. Schneider, M.D., of the University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, wrote In an accompanying editorial that ""further study"" is needed to determine if memantine should be used in combination with donepezil. Health.com: How to age-proof your memory . Donepezil is approved in the U.S. for all stages of Alzheimer's while memantine is approved for moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's. Donepezil is one of a class of drugs known as cholinesterase inhibitors while memantine is a glutamate moderator. ""They both have slightly different ways of helping brain cells talk to each other longer,"" says Snyder. It's unclear if the results would apply to other cholinesterase inhibitors such as galantamine (Razadyne) or rivastigmine (Exelon), the editorial noted. In any event, families, patients and healthcare providers still face difficult decisions in how to treat individual Alzheimer's patients. Health.com: Need a memory boost? Try these quick tips . ""This study starts to look at some of the questions about decisions that physicians and families are making every day, treating loved ones in moderate to severe, what should be treating with, should they stop treatment, should they continue and if so how long, practical,"" says Snyder. ""This underscores our need for more research to fully say what is the right path of treatment and we are desperately in need of more treatments and therapies to help Alzheimer's patients."" The researchers note that stopping donepezil can cause withdrawal (which can temporarily worsen symptoms), so the drug should be gradually tapered down before going off it completely.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Campus protests against rising tuition fees are considered a ritual at South Korean universities. Each year the tuition goes up, students bring out banners and loudspeakers, shave their heads, take over the university president's office and use other creative methods to get the schools to cut back on tuition. The fight usually comes to an end by the time flowers start blooming on campus. But final exams are almost over in the country and students are still protesting. This year they are not fighting with their schools, they have taken to the streets, sometimes in the thousands, and are pointing their fingers at the government. ""Halve the tuition,"" is their slogan. Students and parents say they are tired of the unaffordable prices, lack of scholarships and paling quality of college education. Stories of students and fathers committing suicide due to the pressure of tuition circulated in the local media earlier this year, and students are frustrated with President Lee Myung-bak for not having kept his campaign promise to reduce college tuition by half if he was voted into power. The administration said it was the president's pledge to reduce private education in half that was taken out of context by protesters. However, the government said it understands the importance of education and is coordinating with related ministries to help find a solution. Whatever the promise, students say the cost of tuition and living is too high. Taking classes, doing assignments, and taking on part-time jobs in their free time, they say, leaves no room for self-development. The average tuition fee at a private university can cost up to $7,000 U.S., while the average income hovers above the $20,000 mark. South Korea has the third highest tuition among OECD countries but falls behind the average of those in state scholarships and student loans, according to the Ministry of Education. Lee Hye-su, a 22-year-old journalism major, believes student loans are better than nothing. She is in her sophomore year and is roughly $16,000 in debt. Having been fired from a campus restaurant with only a day's warning, she is now living on what little savings she has and needs to find another part-time job. Lee said, after her freshman year, she wasn't sure she wanted to continue pursuing a university education. So she took a year off, she said. ""I wasn't sure if the education I was receiving was worth all these loans,"" Lee said. However, Lee decided that in a country where more than 80% of students go to university, if she didn't earn a college degree she would not stand a chance in the job market. To get through her university education, Lee said she will take another year off to patch up her financial troubles. ""In the case of tuition, I'm taking out student loans, so I'll be focusing on making money for living costs. At least for tuition fees I can take out loans for now,"" said Lee. By the time she graduates, Lee will have accumulated nearly $32,000 in student loans. This is why Lee took part in a major student rally in Seoul earlier this month, and said she continues to attend the demonstrations as long as they last. She is hoping collective voices will make a change. By her side is her friend Lim Cho-youn, who has taken out $15,000 in student loans and relies heavily on her parents for financial support. She said she is not proud of that. ""I can't ask my parents to shoulder all of that for me, so I'm usually working part-time jobs non-stop,"" Lim said at the protest. Lim goes to classes four days a week and works nine-hour shifts at a supermarket for the remaining three days. ""I personally want the tuition to be cheaper, but I think that's not something I can do on my own. I think everyone needs to come together with their opinion so that our voices are heard, and I think it's important that everyone takes action together,"" she said.","South Korean students protest high tuition fees .

They've waited all night for a chance to see their newborn babies, whom the hospital is holding until the medical bills are paid in full. ""Holding babies until payment is common in Indonesia,"" said Robin Lim, a midwife who founded birthing clinics in Aceh and the island of Bali. At this particular hospital in Bali, mothers who don't pay are allowed in twice a day to feed their baby and change their baby's diaper. Those fortunate enough to find the money may take their babies home. Others might relinquish their parental rights and place their babies up for adoption, Lim explained. ""You worry, 'Will I be able to deliver this baby safely into the world?' But you shouldn't have to worry, 'How will I pay for it?' "" said Lim, 54. ""Mother Robin,"" or ""Ibu Robin"" as she is called by the locals, is working to change that with her Yayasan Bumi Sehat (Healthy Mother Earth Foundation) health clinics. These birthing sanctuaries offer free prenatal care, birthing services and medical aid to anyone who needs it. And the needs are vast in Indonesia. The average family earns the equivalent of $8 a day, according to the International Monetary Fund, but a normal hospital delivery without complications costs around $70. A Caesarian section can cost more than $700. Lim believes Indonesia's high maternal and infant mortality rates are caused in part by these costs, which many women cannot meet. In turn, their lives and the lives of their babies are at risk. According to the United Nations Population Fund, three out of five women giving birth in South Asia do so without a skilled birth attendant on hand. ""The situation is bad ... babies are unattended, deliveries have become commercialized, and mothers die from hemorrhage after childbirth because they can't afford proper care,"" Lim said. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2011 CNN Heroes . Working as a midwife in Indonesia was not something Lim, a U.S. citizen and author of many books related to infant and maternal health, planned for her life. But after several personal tragedies, her life shifted in a new direction. ""In the span of a year, I lost my best friend and one of the midwives who delivered my child,"" said Lim, who has eight children. ""My sister also died as a complication of her third pregnancy, and so did her baby. I was crushed, just crushed. ""But I decided not to get angry. I decided to become part of the solution. If I could help even one family prevent the loss of a mother or a child, I would do that. I would dedicate my life to it."" Lim and her husband, Will, sold their home in Hawaii and moved the family to Bali to ""reinvent their lives."" For Lim, there was no second-guessing the destination. Raised in the Philippines while her father was stationed in Indonesia with the U.S. military, she says she ""always felt happiest in Asia."" Once in Bali, Lim volunteered to help local midwives deliver babies in various homes. And as the demand for her services grew, she decided to receive formal midwife certification. In 2003, with help from the Balinese community and donations from friends across the globe, Lim and her husband opened the first Yayasan Bumi Sehat clinic. At the clinic, there are midwives, nurses, housekeepers, a doctor and a chef. A short time later, after the massive tsunami in 2004, a smaller, sister location was built in Aceh to care for displaced survivors. Combined, the two clinics have facilitated the birth of more than 5,000 babies. Some Indonesian celebrities and expatriates choose Bumi Sehat to birth their children, and they often give donations. But Lim says 80% of the families served by the clinics can barely pay anything. ""Rock star or prostitute, everyone gets treated (like a) VIP at Bumi Sehat ... with kindness and respect,"" she said. ""It's something to see a family come year after year, every time their mango tree gives fruit, and give a few mangoes to the staff to say thank you. ""No one gets rich being a midwife. The riches that you experience are the deeper values."" Part of these riches, Lim said, is the knowledge that so many people rely on the clinics, two of the few 24-hour businesses in Aceh and Bali. ""Everyone knows us,"" she said. ""For expecting couples who don't have a phone to call us for help or for a ride, it's common for them to hop on their motorcycles in the night to get to the clinic, where they know someone will be there waiting. And if they have a special request for me, I'll get a call, I'll get up and I'll go do the delivery."" The love and attention is appreciated by the new mothers, who don't have alternatives for safe, accessible care. ""I had my first born ... in a different clinic,"" said Gusti ""Ayu"" Ketut Gerti, a 31-year-old who came to Lim for the birth of her second child in February. ""There's a big difference between that experience and (Bumi Sehat). Here, I feel comfortable. Robin is very kind, very motherly. ""I do not have money, and I tell my friends to also come here. I wish there were more people like her to lift up the suffering of the poor people."" Lim hopes that Gerti's experience can become the standard practice worldwide. ""Does the world have a responsibility to all pregnant women, to each new baby? Yes,"" Lim said. ""Each baby, each adult deserves a clean, healthy, loving environment. ... Those things are basic. Those are a human right."" Want to get involved? Check out the Bumi Sehat Foundation website at www.bumisehatbali.org and see how to help.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Julian Castro is not cooperating. The mayor of San Antonio knows full well what I want to talk about, and yet he is determined to change the subject to what he believes is a much more pressing story. Where I want to drag him, my friend refuses to go. First, you might be asking what the mayor of America's seventh-largest city is doing in the second-largest city. He's in town on business, and I've come up from my home north of San Diego to have lunch with him. But Castro is not out of place here: He went to college up the highway at Stanford University, and he has plenty of friends and supporters in Southern California. Besides, as one of the most prominent Latino elected officials in the country, he is a national figure. In fact, now that the Texas Democrat has been named one of 30 national co-chairmen for President Barack Obama's re-election campaign, we can expect to see him dispatched often over the next several months to some of the most heavily Latino cities in California. For the 37-year-old, life is about hustling and constantly being in motion. As if to prove it, Castro has run the Rock 'n' Roll half marathon (13.1 miles) each time the race has come to San Antonio. So how ironic that what we are talking about is a proposed artistic re-creation in his city that would depict, among other things, a Mexican sleeping against a wall. Oh, him again. That popular and yet offensive image: a Mexican in a big sombrero asleep against a wall or, more often, under a cactus. He's the Mexican-American community's Charlie Chan, our cigar store Indian, our black Sambo. He personifies and perpetuates the wrongheaded idea that the reason Mexico lost half its territory in the land grab known as the U.S.-Mexican War and the reason that Mexican-Americans have been mistreated and discriminated against in the century and a half since then is, well, because they were inattentive, passive, asleep. In San Antonio, city officials have launched a project to re-create the historic marquee of an iconic drive-in movie theater. The problem is that the marquee in question, installed in the late 1940s, depicted the images of a Mexican in a sombrero asleep against a wall and another Mexican with a burro. Right. We can't forget the burro. Local activists are not amused, calling the images demeaning and racist. They're demanding that the proposed re-creation leave out the offensive images. Apparently, people in San Antonio have a lot to say about this controversy. You know who hasn't said anything publicly? Julian Castro. As a Mexican-American, Castro is much more interested in painting a picture of San Antonio as a city that never sleeps. There ought to be a picture of him in the dictionary next to the word ""positive."" He's no one's victim. And that's probably one reason that The New York Times has referred to him as ""the post-Hispanic Hispanic politician."" For the most part I admire that about him, but I also understand why non-Hispanics fancy the idea that a prominent Hispanic official isn't peddling victimhood. It's because many of them must realize that, these days, Hispanics are being victimized. If our leaders start beating that drum, there's no telling what could happen. At first, when we sat down, Castro resisted saying anything about the controversy over the sleeping Mexican. Then he relented. ""I certainly understand the hurt feelings,"" he said. ""Because it speaks to the negative perception of the Latino community as lazy and unambitious that has hampered it through the years. But, at the same time, we have a majority-Latino city that was just ranked as the top-performing city last year, we have more and more college graduates every day reaching their dreams, so I'm going to spend my time on the positive."" That positive includes the Milken Institute's 2011 ranking of San Antonio as No. 1 out of 200 metropolitan areas in terms of performance, in terms of ""creating and sustaining jobs and economic growth."" And plans for a $150 million performance arts there center are off the ground. There is a $600 million bond measure coming before voters. And the city's unemployment rate is 6.9% -- compared with the statewide rate of 7.3% and the national figure of 8.3%. Still, I couldn't get the sleeping Mexican off my mind. I asked Castro if these recurring racial battles are important or merely a distraction? ""In some people's minds, the community is still limited to that perception,"" he said. ""To the degree that addressing it helps us heal, then it's important."" He added: ""What's interesting about this issue is that they wanted to preserve something that historically had been there. ... It's historic preservation vs. cultural sensitivity. If you go full historical preservation, you're going to do it warts and all. You have to balance it. More than anything, you just feel unfortunate that you're in the pit to begin with."" So I said, ""You're like, 'I don't want to feed this controversy. ...' "" Castro interrupted: ""But I understand it. I respect it. I agree that I don't like that image. I understand how it makes people feel, especially for the older generation. It's a sense of, 'Oh man, here we go again.' When there is a perceived slight, they're more attuned it. They catch it."" To hear him describe it, the proposed re-creation depicts a sleeping Mexican all right, but not as the centerpiece of the marquee. It's just off to the side. The more I think about it, the more I decide this whole controversy is a whole lot of nothing. So, I ask, why is there a problem? ""It's symbolic,"" Castro said. ""It's symbolic of how the Latino community has been perceived. There's a frustration there that we haven't moved beyond that. But I will also say that it's frustrating because we don't see Latinos projected in the media positively. So you feel like: 'Well, if you had all this great press and people who have become astronauts and done other great things regularly in the news ... then there wouldn't be a problem.' If there was a balance, I don't think it would strike people so negatively and we could move on."" This is a wake-up call. Let's put to rest the protests over this image. It's offensive, but it doesn't sting. Not anymore. We know the truth. Time to move on.

"(RS) -- After launching her Caesars Palace residency last December with a series of sold-out dates, Shania Twain, country music's biggest-selling female artist of all time, is returning to Vegas for another series of dates that kick off October 15th and run through mid-December. With the show entering its second year, Twain can turn her attention to her next album, her first since 2002's ""Up!."" Speaking to Rolling Stone from her longtime home of Switzerland, the superstar tells us she has most of the songs in place for the next record and is gearing up to find a producer and define the sound of the album. How is the album coming? I'm pretty much there with my songs, and I'm really just sitting on the fence in regards to a producer. So I'm listening to a lot of records, doing my homework there, and trying to determine who is the right match. Are there people who stand out to you as you listen to records? This is last year, but I'm really stuck on Lana Del Rey. I've been listening to that one a lot more and kind of stuck on the sound of that record. I really love ""Raising Sand"" as well -- Alison Krauss and Robert Plant. So that goes to show you how lost I am as far as production direction, because I'm listening to such a broad spectrum. Both of those productions really appeal to me, and the direction that they took -- just trying to get ideas for myself. Best Albums of 2013: Mid-Year Report . Is there more internal pressure because it has been so long? Yeah, of course. I do want it to be perfect, and I want it to be something that I really enjoy and a product of my inspiration -- not a product of necessarily anything I've done before or anyone I've been before in regards to making records, because it's been a long time. I'm different, I've evolved, and I want that to be reflected in the music. At the same time I don't want to abandon the root of what I am. So it's just really determining where am I really at and just looking through that. It's not as obvious as it seems it should be. What are the songs that have really jumped out at you, and what can you tell us about the ones you have so far? There are probably less upbeat songs. I would say it's more half and half compared to what I would've done in the past, where I would've leaned more towards mostly uptempo songs. I still want to remain positive with my lyrics and stay in that mode with my music, because I enjoy uplifting myself, if you will, with my songs. But at the same time I'm going deeper, and I'm being more realistic with my point of view on things. It's really such a personal journey making a record, but even more so writing the songs. And you feel a bit obsessed about them at this stage as well, I think, because until they get to a producer they're still yours, at this stage where I'm at now. So maybe letting go is going to be a little bit difficult, and I know that when I involve a producer that's sort of what will happen to a degree. Of course I'll remain very involved, but I guess I've just got to get out there and meet these producers face-to-face and talk through. I've just got to get myself to that next stage. 'Raising Sand' was produced by T Bone Burnett. I'd love to see that collaboration, but there are so many good producers out there. There's a lot of choice. It's overwhelming, and it's overwhelming trying to pinpoint who to go with on this project, because it will determine a lot of the direction, and I'm committing myself. It's that fear of committing myself once and for all and locking myself in. That's what scares me the most, really. And I've had a lot of fun just being creative with it and just floating around, changing my mind. And that's part of the whole thing of being creative -- until you commit, you can change your mind and rewrite it and create a new melody and change the story. And at some point that's got to end. And that is the point when you actually make the records. So letting go of that phase of it is probably my biggest hesitation. On the Charts: Luke Bryan Edges Out John Mayer . Any chance you'll preview new material in Vegas? I think it's too soon. I probably could start doing that, but I don't want to get locked into a performance mode with a song, either, until I've taken it a little further down the line. Just talking it through, like we're doing now, does help. And it gets me in that mindset. It's probably the right time now to start taking it more seriously as far as getting into the studio, especially since I'm finished producing the show. The show took well over a year to put together, so that was a production in itself, like making a record. You had to write the whole story -- literally wrote the show out like a script, worked through the production and had the technical side of it and eventually delivered it. So I'm only recently freed up from going into one production and just getting geared up to go into another one, which should be the record. Were there tours or performances that inspired you in creating this Vegas show? What we can do in that room I really wouldn't be able to do anywhere else -- certainly not tour with it, because the technology is so sophisticated you can't really move around with it. So the joy of having that high-end technology and taking advantage of that was a huge part of the excitement for me, and the margins where I can go and take it are just so broad in comparison to touring. So I wrote the show with all of that in mind, knowing I would have all this technology available -- this great room, the acoustics and this giant stage and everything like that. So I almost shot it more like a music video, all of my more iconic music videos or images, and based it from there. I wanted to bring those more alive, so I used that as the influence in regards to the fashion and the look of things. I want it to be familiar to people as well. I want them to reminisce, but I wanted them to see things in a more refreshed, contemporary way. Then there was the fun part of picking the director and giving them all my ideas, my wish list, and asking them all, ""Which ones do you think you can realize, and how would you make them happen?"" And then the spine of the show was the song list. I want people to hear the songs they know. I want people to hear the hits and I want them to be satisfied in that regard. It always disappoints me when I go to a concert and they don't play my favorite song, or at least one of their biggest hits. That process, for me, even without being the performer, was a fantastic experience, and really the big reason why I didn't plunge into the record right away. I needed that year just to write the show, to create it and build it. I know you've seen a lot of shows of late as well. What blew you away? Sting I've seen a few times and he really inspired me, in the sense that he breaks the songs down a lot and will take a different approach. He'll take an acoustic approach to them, he'll rearrange them for the live stage. And I thought, ""I really admire someone taking the license to do that, owning that."" I played around with that a little bit in the show as well, so that was an influence. I really admire artists that are willing to take a different approach and a different angle to their shows. So I did some of that. See the original story at RollingStone.com. Copyright © 2011 Rolling Stone.","Shania Twain is working on her first album since 2002's ""Up!""

"(CNN) -- When men and women enlist in the military, they take an oath to support and defend the Constitution, including the First Amendment, against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and affirm that they will ""bear true faith and allegiance to the same."" That oath is betrayed by legislation that sneaked through the House of Representatives last week and was signed into law by the president Monday. Known as the ""Sanctity of Eternal Rest for Veterans Act,"" it passed as a small piece of an otherwise unexceptional omnibus veterans' bill. It would broadly expand existing restrictions on political protest on public land near military funerals. Notably, the ACLU of Eastern Missouri is actively litigating against similar state legislation that is far narrower in some respects. Protests cannot be held within 300 feet of the cemetery, and the law bans conduct that blocks someone from entering or leaving the cemetery within a 500-foot radius. Protests are prohibited two hours before the funeral through two hours afterward. It similarly expands restrictions on protests at government cemeteries and gives people injured by the protest a right to sue. Although it covers all protests near military funerals, the law is targeted, at the Westboro Baptist Church, and that's a First Amendment problem in and of itself. Its members believe that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the attendant casualties, are divine punishment for America's acceptance of lesbian and gay rights. They protest outside military funerals to publicize their beliefs -- holding signs that say ""Pray for More Dead Soldiers"" and ""God Killed Your Sons"" -- but do not cause any disruption of the funeral proper. Now, as repellent as these protests are, they are a permissible exercise of the freedom of speech. If the First Amendment means anything, it's that the government cannot target a group for censorship because it disagrees with the group's message. This legislation does exactly that. Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, introduced the bill a month after the Supreme Court ruled in Snyder v. Phelps that, as lawful speech on a public issue, Westboro Baptist Church protests warranted the highest protection of the First Amendment against state tort claims. But the imprudence of this legislation goes further. Part of the public reaction to Westboro Baptist protests, as happens with much unpopular political speech, are counterprotests. Those would likely be barred as well by the expanded law, under its ""tendency to disrupt"" language. If the counterprotests are immune from the law's reach because the government agrees with their message, the law will be doubly unconstitutional. The issues raised by this new law are a lot like those in the dust-up after Chick-fil-A CEO Dan Cathy spoke out against same-sex marriage. I agree that Chick-fil-A shouldn't be celebrated as some sort of free speech hero, and if you choose not to indulge in a Chick-fil-A chicken sandwich in protest of intolerance, more power to you. But I'm more concerned by the suggestion of a Chicago alderman that he would go so far as to block a local Chick-fil-A franchise's building permit simply because of Cathy's views, rather than any discriminatory policy of the chain. In some ways, a willingness to ignore the law to shut down someone with whom you simply disagree is worse than Cathy spouting off against marriage equality. Part of living in America means putting up with words with which you not only disagree but that offend deeply. This is especially true when, as in the Westboro Baptist Church case, the words actually carry a political message. The expansiveness of the new law violates this core principle. It isn't about protecting the solemnity of a soldier's funeral; that's already fully protected under existing trespass, private property and disorderly conduct laws. It's about censoring unpopular speech. That is inconsistent with the law, the Constitution and the military's oath to the Constitution. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gabe Rottman.","A new law expands limits on political protest on public land near military funerals .

"(CNN) -- Thank Depeche Mode for, shall we say, introducing interesting concepts to the bedroom. At least, that's what one female fan said during the band's recent panel promoting its13th album ""Delta Machine"" at South by Southwest. The fan noted that the group's music has helped, umm, set the romantic mood for some. Reminded of this, songwriter (and sometimes singer) Martin Gore chuckled. ""Yeah, that was funny,"" he told CNN. ""Someone once said to us, 'Do you realize how many babies were conceived listening to 'Somebody'?' "" Could the band's repertoire -- which includes songs such as ""Master and Servant"" (with its pre-""50 Shades of Grey"" references to BDSM), ""Strangelove,"" ""Stripped,"" and ""A Question of Lust,"" -- have worked as an instructional manual for fans? Gore's songwriting at its ""Goriest"" provided a sexual initiation of sorts into a world that blurred the lines between pain, pleasure, love, guilt, and sin. Sex ""is one of the themes I've tackled over the years, because it's something important, and it's something I feel passionate about,"" Gore said. ""But we weren't analyzing it."" Front man Dave Gahan's vocals push the carnal implications, but when Gore added his own voice, it gave a layer of pensive, tortured tenderness. And though Gore might have pushed the sexual concepts visually -- appearing on stage in women's lingerie, skirts, and bondage gear -- the message was a plea to ""understand me."" A deeper dig into the band's lyrics over a 30 years also yields themes about world politics, socialism, racism and religion. But it was a pre-emo appeal to the alienated and introverted that made Depeche Mode a bridge between the industrial/electronic/goth and pop worlds, making them one of the largest arena acts still considered a cult band. ""I don't know how we managed it,"" Gore said, ""but we're just outside the mainstream. We don't sound like the mainstream. So even in areas where we're extremely popular, we're seen as more of an underground band. Even in Germany, where we're one single away from having more top 10 singles than the Beatles, we're still seen as a cult band, and we have that mystique about us."" Bands such as RÃ¶yksopp, Coldplay, Linkin Park, the Killers, and Arcade Fire all cite Depeche Mode as an influence. ""It's incredible,"" Gore said, citing his surprise at Susan Boyle's cover of ""Enjoy the Silence."" His favorites of the covers of the band's songs include the Smashing Pumpkins' version of ""Never Let Me Down Again,"" and the Johnny Cash version of ""Personal Jesus."" ""That was very special and unbelievable,"" he said. ""I really didn't think that it was reality when that happened. Someone told me they heard it on the radio, and I said, 'No, you must be mistaken.' "" When Frank Ocean recently introduced himself as a super fan, Gore was happy to make his acquaintance. ""We happened to be in the same studio complex, and he was working downstairs with Alicia Keys,"" Gore recalled. ""And toward the end of our session, he asked our engineer if he could come in and have a listen, so when we finished the song, he walked over and said hello. And then he said, 'I've got a track, I'd love to play it for you, I've love for you to do something on it.' And it was really good."" Gore stayed an extra day at the studio to add some material to the then-untitled track, which might find its way on Ocean's next album. ""I have no idea whether he'll actually use the pieces we did on there, but hopefully it will surface one day! It sounded really good,"" he said. Not a Depechie, however? Simon Cowell. The reality show judge recently became a target when Gore criticized him, joking that Cowell should be shot for his crimes against pop music. Cowell, naturally, shot back with his own vitriol. In response to the fracas, a gun range in Las Vegas added a target of Cowell for anyone wishing to take up Gore's suggestion. ""That's funny,"" Gore laughed. ""It was pleasantly reassuring to see how many people seemed to side with me!"" Gore's songs usually start out in a simple style -- ""Enjoy the Silence,"" for instance, originally was a stripped-down affair with Gore singing over an organ sound. ""It was meant to be pastoral, and Alan (Wilder) at the time had the idea to put a beat to it,"" Gore recalled, laughing. ""I was like, 'What?! That's going against everything it's saying!' But we tried it, and then I put the guitar riff on it, and then something magical happened, and it became the first or second most popular track we ever recorded. I guarantee you it wouldn't have been, if we had kept the harmonium version."" For the songs that Gahan wrote this time around, such as ""Broken,"" the band altered them ""a bit more to fit the whole sonic picture of the album,"" he said. And some songs, whether consciously or unconsciously, allude to the band's entire sonic history -- a little bit of ""Personal Jesus"" pokes through ""Soothe My Soul."" ""I keep going back to that Gary Glitter beat!"" Gore said. Depeche Mode is currently rehearsing in Los Angeles for its upcoming world tour.

"(TIME.com) -- Whether you're pleased or peeved by Mitt Romney's pick for running mate, Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan, there's no denying that the politician is a model of good health. A former personal trainer, Ryan, who stands 6 feet, 2 inches, and weighs 163 pounds with 6%-8% body fat, works out like a warrior and leads fellow Hill staffers in daily morning sessions of the popular 90-day, body-sculpting program called P90X. ""I'm kind of a workout guy. I've always been into it. [Former Mich. Rep.] Bart Stupak and I lead [P90X classes] — there's about a dozen of us that do it,"" Ryan told Politico. ""It works because it hits your body in many different ways: pull-ups, sit-ups, lots of cardio, karate, jump training, yoga. It pushes your body...and gets you out of your plateau."" TIME.com: We tried the Urban Rebounding Workout . Even Ryan's critics, including Washington Post political reporter Dana Milbank, acknowledge that the Congressman's personal health priorities are in the right place: . ""It can only do us good as a nation to have as a role model such a fine physical specimen in high office. Hopefully, Ryan will inspire more Americans to get healthy. That's important, because if Ryan succeeds in ending Medicare, they won't be able to afford getting sick."" Ryan isn't the only fan of P90X, by far. The standard home fitness package by Beach Body costs $119.85 and has sold more than 3.5 million copies since 2005. What do you get in the box? Twelve workout DVDs, a 100-page fitness guide, a nutrition plan and a 90-day calendar to track your progress. Workouts include a range of exercises — including chest and back strengthening, plyometrics and yoga — designed to create ""muscle confusion,"" a cross-training regimen that's supposed to keep the body from adapting to the same exercise over time and prevent plateaus. TIME.com: It's not too late to starting training for a distance run . We talked with P90X creator Tony Horton, who leads occasional sessions with Ryan on the Hill. Think you can hack it? P90X's core training technique relies on ""muscle confusion,"" which Paul Ryan credits for its success. Can you explain what that is? Muscle confusion is a variety of exercises. Typically a lot of programs focus purely on stationary yoga, Pilates, weight training or cardiovascular — P90X has all those things. The main purpose is to avoid the three things that cause most people to stop exercising: boredom, injuries and plateaus. In P90X, there's variety in fitness with muscle confusion, and the goal is for people to get through the whole 90 days so they have real success and real results. TIME.com: We tried the SLT Megaformer Workout . Who gets the most out of P90X? When we created it, we made it for two categories of people. We had a big contingency of Power 90 [another Horton workout system] customers that it helped quite a bit, and we were trying to get people out of the gym who weren't getting results. But it's turned out to be a workout for the military. I'm touring five military bases in two weeks because they're using it as well. It's [also] turned out to be a workout for the clinically obese — I've met dozens and dozens of people who are obese and used this program. One of the reasons this works is that there are dozens of modifications other programs don't have. It's become much bigger than we ever anticipated. What can users expect during the 90-day regimen? It's broken up into cycles. Each month there is a different sequence of exercises [each laid out in the DVDs]. The first three weeks you do the basic exercises we tell you, and then you have one recovery week. The second month you get a whole new bunch of routines done in different sequences and the recovery week again. Remember recovery doesn't mean you don't do anything; recovery means you are still working hard. [That is, you're still working out, but not quite as rigorously as during the first three weeks of the month.] In the final month, you do a combination of what you did in the first and second month, which is an extension of muscle confusion. TIME.com: How your iPod can help you run faster and harder . What equipment is needed besides the DVDs? In a majority of the exercises the only thing required is the human body, Mother Earth and Sir Isaac Newton's law of gravity. But having a pull-up bar helps. You don't need it, but it certainly enhances the program, as well as dumbbells and bands. Some people just use resistance bands, but some men who want more size will go out and get dumbbells. What if I don't want bulging muscles like the buff people in your infomercials? There are three ways you can go through the program. There's the classic version, which is the basic way we designed it. But we also created a lean version, which focuses more on flexibility, range of motion and cardiovascular fitness. There's another version for athletes called doubles, which they're doing twice a day. ... You can customize the 90 days based on what you need. TIME.com: 5 common mistakes you're making at the gym . How important is diet when you're on the P90X system? It's about the food as well. I've just launched Tony Horton Kitchen, which delivers weekly meals to customers. Often the reason so many people in this country struggle is because they are putting the wrong things in their mouths. There's too much fat, sugar, salt and chemicals coming out of plastic bags and cans and I'm trying to get people to eat whole foods. Eat [foods] that when you look down at your plate, you can pronounce them. The eating program has great recipes and a diet program that says, 'hey look, you can eat beef, you can eat vegetarian, you can eat Paleolithic.' Just eat the way you're great grandparents ate, and you'll be better off. Why do you think P90X has become so popular? I think there are three reasons really. I think No. 1 is obviously muscle confusion. No. 2 is the modifications built into the program for anybody, whether you have a prosthetic leg or you have 200 pounds to lose. The little black dress of fitness . People tell me that I deliver fitness in a way that's a bit different than others. I use a lot of humor and silliness. Everyone in the program has nicknames and I do a terrible Arnold Schwarzenegger impression. I make something that is vital for people to change their health and wellness and I've delivered it in a way that is powerful for people. It's fun and we don't treat it like rocket science and I'm not the drill sergeant personality. I'm the kid with two left feet who was picked last for every sport but dodge ball, so I understand the trials and tribulations of getting fit from my own personal experience — it was not an easy process for me. I'm trying to make it easy and fun, and I think that's why it's done well. How often do you make it to D.C. to workout with Hill staffers like Paul Ryan? I've been in the Congressional gym about five or six times with Paul Ryan, Heath Shuler [D-N.C.], Kevin McCarthy [R-California], Jesse Jackson, Jr. [D-Illinois]. ... It's usually anywhere between eight and 20 Congressmen [in a session]. It's turned out to be about once every eight months or twice a year. TIME.com: The best runners' playlists on TIME's Spotify . Politicians are as busy as the rest of us. Is P90X doable with an already packed schedule? It's an hour a day. A lot of people would say no. ... [But] people find time to fit it in because they see that it works. A lot of people have friends and family and coworkers and neighbors that look different, that act different, that feel different, that have more energy, that sleep better, that are off their meds [because of P90X]. We can put the before-and-after pictures in the infomercial — and these are real people who submit their photos to us — but when it's people you know in your life and you see how different they are, how much happier they are, how much more fit they are — that's the selling point. It's pretty much word of mouth now at this point. I'm trying to change the way people look at [fitness]. It can be a fun process and it can be permanent.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Senate Intelligence Committee will receive a classified document Thursday that seeks to justify the administration's policy of targeting Americans overseas via drone attacks, chairwoman Dianne Feinstein said. ""I am pleased that the president has agreed to provide the Intelligence Committee with access to the OLC (Office of Legal Counsel) opinion regarding the use of lethal force in counterterrorism operations,"" the California Democrat said in a statement Wednesday. ""It is critical for the committee's oversight function to fully understand the legal basis for all intelligence and counterterrorism operations."" The announcement came shortly after an administration official said President Barack Obama had yielded to demands that he turn over to Congress the classified Justice Department legal advice that seeks to justify the policy. ""Today, as part of the president's ongoing commitment to consult with Congress on national security matters, the president directed the Department of Justice to provide the Congressional intelligence committees access to classified Office of Legal Counsel advice related to the subject of the Department of Justice white paper,"" an administration official said Wednesday. The 16-page white paper -- titled ""Lawfulness of a Lethal Operation Directed Against a U.S. Citizen who is a Senior Operational Leader of Al Qaida or an Associated Force"" -- is a policy paper rather than an official legal document. That policy paper was sent to key congressional committees last year but became public just this week. The president, the official said, was turning over the legal opinion related to the policy because he believes the scrutiny and debate is healthy. The Senate Intelligence Committee is expected to receive the document the same day Obama's pick for CIA director, John Brennan, faces a confirmation hearing. Brennan's hearing Thursday comes amid complaints from senators, including several Democrats, about secrecy surrounding the drone policy. Amnesty International also weighed in on the debate, saying Congress should grill Brennan on his claim that the Obama administration's drone strikes are ""conducted in full compliance with the law."" Iran says it has footage from downed U.S. drone . ""Furthermore, Congress should immediately hold public hearings with independent experts to examine the administration's legal reasoning and ensure that the administration is following the 'rule book' for the use of lethal force that already exists: international human rights law and, in the very narrow circumstances to which it applies, international humanitarian law,"" the group said. In a 2012 speech at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, Brennan asserted that the drone strikes are legal under the Authorization for Use of Military Force resolution passed by Congress after the 9/11 attacks. In addition, ""There is nothing in international law that bans the use of remotely piloted aircraft for this purpose or that prohibits us from using lethal force against our enemies outside of an active battlefield, at least when the country involved consents or is unable or unwilling to take action against the threat,"" Brennan said at the time. This does not appear to be the view of Ben Emmerson, United Nations special rapporteur on counterterrorism and human rights, who announced plans in October to investigate U.S. drone attacks and the extent to which they cause civilian casualties. Opinion: John Brennan, Obama's counterterrorist . The drone campaign against al Qaeda and its allies has been one of Brennan's biggest legacies in the four years he was the president's principal adviser on terrorism. According to a count by the public policy group New America Foundation, at least 28 of al Qaeda's leading members have been killed in drone strikes, including the U.S. citizen Anwar al-Awlaki, who played an operational role in al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Al-Awlaki's teenage son died in a separate strike. On Wednesday, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee said the attack that killed al-Awlaki was justified. ""This is somebody who had said that he didn't want his U.S. citizenship anymore,"" Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, told MSNBC's ""Andrea Mitchell Reports."" He said al-Awlaki had officially joined al Qaeda, and al Qaeda had declared war on the United States."" ""The legal basis of this goes back many, many years when U.S. citizens would go and fight for foreign nations that were engaging in combat with the United States,"" Rogers said. ""So what they were saying is, once you've made that choice, you no longer get the protections that you would. I mean, if you join the enemy overseas, you join the enemy overseas. And we're going to fight the enemy overseas."" In his speech at the Wilson Center, Brennan said drone strikes are ""ethical"" because of ""the unprecedented ability of remotely piloted aircraft to precisely target a military objective while minimizing collateral damage; one could argue that never before has there been a weapon that allows us to distinguish more effectively between an al Qaeda terrorist and innocent civilians."" And Obama himself defended it in an appearance last October on ""The Daily Show."" ""There are times where there are bad folks somewhere on the other side of the world, and you've got to make a call and it's not optimal,"" he said. ""And sometimes you've got to make some tough calls. But you can do so in a way that's consistent with international law and with American law.""

The drone program has been shrouded in secrecy and has been criticized by senators .

"(CNN) -- Amid our vacations, fireworks and barbecues Wednesday, it's easy to forget that we are actually commemorating the signing of the Declaration of Independence. The most famous phrase from that document is one of our nation's founding values: ""All men are created equal."" As it happens, this July Fourth week brings two significant victories for that value that are worth celebrating. Most Americans are probably not aware that since 2011, more than two dozen measures have passed that will make it more difficult for some eligible citizens to vote, denying them the opportunity to participate equally in our democracy. Too often, it appears that politicians are trying to manipulate voting laws to save their jobs and pick their voters, rather than allowing all voters to choose their politicians. The good news is that the public, the courts and some elected officials have fought these new restrictions in several states, including Ohio, Maine, Missouri and, just Tuesday, Michigan. Another view: Voter ID laws are common sense . To the surprise of many -- at the urging of good government and voting rights groups, several editorial pages and many of Michigan's citizens -- Gov. Rick Snyder vetoed a package of restrictive voting laws in that state. One of the bills would have restricted voter registration drives. Under that bill's proposed rules, the League of Women Voters of Michigan, which has conducted voter registration drives for decades, would need to attend mandatory, state-approved training sessions. But the law did not say how widely those trainings would be available. The law also would have required volunteers to sign an intimidating form threatening them with criminal prosecution for vaguely defined offenses. (In May, U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle stopped a similar requirement in a Florida law, saying this can have ""no purpose other than to discourage voluntary participation in legitimate, indeed constitutionally protected, activities."") Also this week, the state of Florida confirmed it will likely not resume its purge of the voter rolls, which gained national notoriety and could have kept thousands of eligible citizens from voting in November. Florida Gov. Rick Scott claimed the purge was necessary to get noncitizens off the registration rolls. Of course, if a state confirms that noncitizens are on the rolls, it should take appropriate steps to remove them. But that is not what the Sunshine State was doing. Rather, the state created a list rife with errors that many local election officials warned from the start was inaccurate. This flawed list was used to send purge notices to hundreds of eligible citizens, disproportionately Hispanic and members of other minority groups. Among them was Bill Internicola, a Brooklyn-born 91-year-old WWII veteran, who said he was ""flabbergasted"" when he received such a letter. Another view: Economic policies will discourage Hispanics, not voter ID laws . Last week, the same judge who stopped part of Florida's registration law scolded the state for the ""major flaws"" in its purge, which was ""likely to have a discriminatory impact"" on the tens of thousands of newly naturalized citizens in the state each year. Moving forward, Florida must create strict and uniform criteria for developing purge lists, as suggested in the Brennan Center's 2008 ""Voter Purges"" report, one of the first systematic examinations of the chaotic and largely unseen world of purges. Sadly, the news isn't all good. The Brennan Center estimates that 16 states have passed restrictive voting laws that have the potential to affect the 2012 election. These states account for 214 electoral votes, or 79% of the total needed to win the presidency. Elections should not be decided by politicians who manipulate voting laws for partisan gain. Improving our elections need not come at the expense of our shared value that all citizens should have the opportunity to participate in our democracy. If we truly want to make our election system better -- and get past the voting wars seen in Florida, Michigan and across the country -- the first step is to modernize voter registration, which could add more than 50 million eligible voters to the rolls, permanently. Even though voter files are kept on computers, citizens must fill out paper forms to register, and can be dropped from the rolls due to errors or address changes. Modernizing registration would use digital technology to enable citizens to register and stay registered to vote, and to update their registration online. In recent years, at least 21 states have moved forward to automate voter registration at Department of Motor Vehicle offices, a step supported by officials from both parties. Experiences in the states demonstrate that this increases accuracy and registration rates, minimizes the potential for fraud and saves money. All eligible citizens should have the opportunity -- and responsibility -- to vote. The right way to honor our Founding Fathers is to ensure their bold ideals of equality of opportunity are upheld. Let's make our election system better, and reject measures that restrict access to the polls. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lawrence Norden.","Lawrence Norden: Since 2011, more than two dozen restrictive voting measures have passed .
Fortunately, some states have rejected them, as Michigan did Tuesday, says Norden .
Florida will probably not resume its notorious purging of voter rolls, he says .

"(CNN) -- Call it a mixed blessing -- one that may have saved an Arizona convenience store employee's life. When Phoenix Circle K manager Jerimiah Willey was pistol-whipped during a robbery last month, he landed at St. Joseph's Hospital with a head injury that required eight staples. ""He hit me in the head twice. ... and then throughout the whole thing, he was nudging me with the gun,"" Willey told CNN affiliate KTVK. The hospital did a CT scan while he was there and discovered something far worse -- a massive and potentially life-threatening brain tumor. ""They said that had this not been found and soon around the time that it was found, that he probably just would have gone to sleep one night and not been able to wake up,"" his wife, Alisha Willey, told the affiliate. He is recovering from the first of what's expected to be three brain surgeries. ""It's our understanding, that because of the size, we believe there's going to be two more surgeries,"" his mother-in-law, Rose Gould, told CNN. The surgery has left him partially paralyzed, with slurred speech and some loss of hearing. He's undergoing therapy. Although the road ahead for the Willeys and their three children is uncertain, they're hopeful that the slow-growing tumor is benign and was caught before it was too late. A fund has been set up to help pay for the family's medical expenses. ""It's hard to be thankful to somebody who was so violent,"" Alisha Willey said.

"(CNN) -- Earlier this month Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) visited Howard University to take a swing at repairing relations between African Americans and the Republican Party. As famed sportscaster Harry Kalas would have said, it was largely a swing and a miss. Paul struck out when he tried to equate today's Republican Party with the party of Abraham Lincoln, while ignoring much of the 150 years in between. (He even acknowledged his mistakes shortly after). But his willingness to step up to the plate can provide a lesson for a GOP struggling to get on top. Republicans will not win black votes by paying lip service to party history while attacking social programs and voting rights. But they can make inroads by showing a commitment to civil rights, something Paul managed to do briefly in his remarks. Paul received applause when he told the Howard crowd, ""We should not have drug laws or a court system that disproportionately punishes the black community."" He illustrated using one issue where the GOP can connect with black voters: criminal justice reform. Just before the 2012 elections, the NAACP took a nonpartisan survey of black voters in key swing states. We found that 55% of African Americans believe Republicans ""don't care at all about civil rights"" while another 32% think the party ""just says what minorities want to hear."" But 14% said they would be more likely to vote for a Republican in the future, if they found a candidate who demonstrated a strong commitment to civil rights. Mass incarceration is a fundamental civil rights issue. African Americans make up 40% of the 2.4 million people in America's bloated prison system. That includes the vast majority of those in prison for nonviolent drug offenses. If current trends continue, one in three black males born today can expect to spend time in prison during his life. As Paul demonstrated, mass incarceration is also a fundamental conservative issue. State spending on prisons has tripled over the last 30 years, reaching $70 billion in 2008. Federal prisons are at 139% capacity, often thanks to harsh mandatory minimum sentences. And who pays for all these guards, beds and three square meals a day? Taxpayers. In fact, some red states have led the way on criminal justice reform. In Georgia, South Carolina and Texas, Republican legislatures have teamed up with progressives to increase options for parole and reduce mandatory minimums. In Texas, the NAACP and progressive activists worked with leaders of the Tea Party to pass a dozen reform measures. Last year, Texas scheduled the first prison closure in state history. Rand Paul is not the first national Republican leader to speak up, either. Newt Gingrich and Jeb Bush are both members of the conservative think tank Right on Crime. And in 2011, Gingrich joined Grover Norquist and other unlikely allies - including Mike Jiminez, the president of California's prison guard union -- to endorse the NAACP's report, Misplaced Priorities: Over Incarcerate, Under Educate. The report revealed how the rise in prison spending has caused states to spend less on education. These alliances should draw the attention of Republican leaders. Many Democrats shy away from talking about criminal justice reform, for fear of being labeled ""soft on crime."" According to the NAACP's election survey, 42% of African American voters believe the Democratic Party is failing them on criminal justice. The GOP has a chance to fill the leadership vacuum and demonstrate their civil rights bona fides. Paul is poised to lead the conversation on criminal justice reform. At Howard he touted the ""Justice Safety Valve Act of 2013,"" which he recently introduced with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, the Democratic senator from Vermont. The bill would allow federal judges to bypass federal mandatory minimum sentences if the sentence is too lengthy or if it simply does not fit the crime. Paul told students that his friends called him ""either brave or crazy"" for showing up at Howard University, a statement that says more about his friends than the audience at Howard. Nonetheless, Paul and his Republican Party would display true bravery, and political savvy, by taking this opportunity to walk Lincoln's walk and take on the new Jim Crow. Moving from ""tough on crime"" to ""smart on crime"" would be good for this country. It would also be a smart move for the Republican Party if they ever hope to get on base with black voters. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Benjamin Todd Jealous.","Benjamin Jealous: Rand Paul's attempt to heal rift between blacks and GOP fell short .

"(CNN) -- When Felicity Aston started smelling fish and chips, she knew something was wrong. The unmistakable aroma of the classic British pub food, deep-fried fish and french fries, could only mean one thing: She must be hallucinating. After all, there are no pubs in the middle of Antarctica. The British explorer was skiing solo across the great frozen continent and had not seen another human being for weeks. ""It drove me insane,"" said Aston. ""It was like I was skiing along a huge row of fish and chips shops, the whole day."" Read more: Global warming hits Antarctica, study finds . But, she says, she kept wiggling her fingers and toes to check for hypothermia, gritted her teeth and kept going, eventually crossing Antarctica in 59 days -- becoming the first woman in the world to make it solo. Despite being a seasoned explorer -- she previously led a team to the South Pole; raced across Arctic Canada and traversed the inland ice of Greenland -- this was her first solo expedition. She says she has never felt so alone. ""The first time it really struck me was when the plane dropped me off (at) the beginning of my journey, and I watched it disappearing into a dark blob (in) the sky."" As she started putting up her tent and organizing her equipment, she says she realized her heart was jumping, she was out of breath and her hands were shaking. Read more: Ship spends 10th day stuck in frozen waters off Antarctica . ""I realized I was absolutely petrified,"" she said. ""And it wasn't because I (was) scared of dying or injury, it was just that level of aloneness that was instantly frightening. Just the weight of the amount of time on my own."" Being alone in the Antarctic means being on a high alert all the time. There is a danger at every step: Crevasse fields; whiteouts; sharp-edged grooves and ridges; temperatures below -40 C and hurricane-speed winds. Among the many physical impacts this environment has on the body -- exhaustion, malnutrition, frostbite, cramps, sunburn -- one of the most serious is hypothermia. Among polar explorers, hypothermia is known as ""the silent killer"" because its first symptom is a progressive inability to think clearly, recognize the problem and do something about it. ""The first warning signal of hypothermia is abnormal behavior -- being very quiet, confused, incoherent,"" Aston explained. These are things that other members of an expedition pick up on, but, in a team of one, there's no one else to raise the red flag. Read more: Patient from Antarctica flown to New Zealand for treatment . ""If you're alone, you have to make sure that if something goes wrong, you can get out of it,"" she said. ""I had to always make sure that I would be able to put up a tent and look after myself at the end of each day."" That's why she constantly wiggled her fingers, to make sure they weren't becoming numb, as the inability to use her hands would have been fatal. Despite the endless physical dangers, Aston says the real challenge is winning the mental battle with solitude. ""It became the biggest struggle of the whole trip,"" she said. ""Every single morning, the first thing that struck me was, 'Oh my goodness, I can't do this, I don't want to be here, I've made a terrible mistake.' ""I realized that the real (trick) of this would not be how strong I was or how much experience I had, it would literally be getting out of that tent."" But each day, she would get out of the tent and repeat exactly the same routine. After 40 days, she says she started noticing changes. Read more: Scientists: Japanese tsunami produced Antarctic icebergs . ""I realized I would go a whole day and really not think about anything at all. My head was completely empty,"" she said. Hallucinations and strange sensations came next: ""The sun became really important to me,"" she added. During the polar summer, the sun circles in the sky, never going down. It became Aston's constant companion and she began greeting it in the morning. ""This developed into me having full-blown conversations with the sun in my mind,"" she added. Crying also became part of the daily routine and she says it wasn't until day 15 of her journey that she managed to go a whole day without bursting into tears. In pictures: Stunning undersea panoramas now on Google Street View . As an experienced explorer, she knows they are part of the experience. ""The men do as much crying as the women do,"" she said. ""And the women smell as bad after six weeks without shower."" While bodily functions don't make the difference, it's the attitude that sets man and women apart. She says that even the most experienced women tend to suffer from a lack of self confidence and sense of vulnerability. ""When I take a groups of women out into the cold environment, they are a lot more unsure, their default position is 'I can't do this,'"" she said. Her job then becomes to convince them about the opposite. With men, it's different. ""Usually they'll fling themselves at it and their default position is 'I already know how to do this, I know exactly how to do this,' and it's a matter of bringing them in and telling them that they need to think more and watch out for certain things."" After days of skiing alone, in extreme cold, these differences disappear and men and women have to deal with the same issues. Apart from one, which Aston has yet to find a solution to: Going to the toilet. During the coldest days in Antarctica, she was deliberately dehydrating herself to avoid the need to get undressed in the bitter frost. ""It's the only time in my life I've ever ... wanted to be a man,"" Aston said. ""You see the guys just turn around and have a quick pee in the snow and you go, 'Arrghh, I have to get undressed in this cold!'""","British explorer Felicity Aston became first woman to ski solo across Antarctica .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Two teenage girls, who were found hanging from a tree in northern India in May, were not raped as originally alleged, according to new forensic reports commissioned by federal investigators. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) sent samples obtained by police in the northern Uttar Pradesh state, where the incident had happened, to a special DNA fingerprinting facility in southern India for re-examination after it took over the case, an official source told CNN Tuesday. ""(Test) results didn't show the girls were sexually assaulted,"" said the CBI source, who requested anonymity. ""There were also several discrepancies in the post-mortem report."" But with the latest evidence appearing to rule out rape, investigators, for now, have dropped plans to file charges against the five. ""The CBI is not going to file the charge-sheet against them as of now. However, we are not giving them clean chit either,"" CBI spokeswoman Kanchan Prasad said. She said the investigation into the girls' killing would continue. Under Indian law, suspects in custody for serious crimes become eligible to apply for bail if formal charges are not filed against them in the trial court within 90 days. Left hanging from tree . Five people, including two police officers, were arrested after the girls -- who were cousins aged 14 and 16 -- were left hanging from the branches of a mango tree in a remote village in Budaun district on May 27. A photo from the village showed the body of one girl, dressed in a green tunic and pants, hanging from the tree. A large group of people, many of them young children, were gathered around the grisly scene. The girls' families filed a complaint accusing three brothers of rape and murder. Police said an autopsy confirmed the girls had been raped and strangled. No quick fix for India's rape crisis . Widespread anger . The case caused widespread revulsion in India and beyond, reminding people about the brutal gang-rape of a girl on a public bus in Delhi in December 2012. Back then, a 23-year-old physiotherapy student was traveling home from a movie with a male friend when at least five other men on the bus dragged her to the back of the bus and then beat up her friend. The men took turns raping the woman as the bus drove around the city for almost an hour, police said at the time. The two friends were then dumped by the side of the road, with the young woman later dying from her injuries. That incident energized activists and women generally, with government officials promising action to ensure that girls and women feel safe.

"(CNN) -- Taiwan and China held their highest level talks for more than six decades Tuesday, marking the first government-to-government contact since the pair's acrimonious split in 1949. Wang Yu-chi of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), which oversees the island's China policy, met with his mainland Chinese counterpart Zhang Zhijun, of China's Taiwan Affairs Office. After the meeting, China's state news agency Xinhua said the two sides had agreed to open a regular communication channel. ""We should both be resolute to not let cross-strait relations suffer any more twists and turns, and never let it (the relationship) go backward,"" Zhang was quoted by Xinhua as saying. Previous contact between the two sides has been conducted through semi-official foundations or through political parties, not by government ministers acting in their official capacities. ""Being able to sit down and talk today was quite unimaginable in the past,"" Xinhua quoted Wang as saying. In a statement, Taiwan's MAC said that Wang had invited Zhang to visit Taiwan to better understand society and popular sentiment. Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou said the visit had "" extraordinary significance,""  according to the island's Central News Agency. On his departure from Taipei, Wang said the visit would not be ""easy"" and the two sides would not sign any specific agreement. The meeting took place in Nanjing, which was the seat of government under the Kuomintang or Nationalist party before a civil war with the Chinese Communists forced Nationalist forces to flee to Taiwan in 1949. Ever since, the island and mainland China have been governed separately. The exclusion of two Taiwan reporters from covering the meeting has soured the start of Wang's historic visit, which is expected to last until Friday. Two journalists from Taiwan's Apple Daily and Radio Free Asia were excluded from a delegation of more than 80 reporters accompanying Wang, according to Freedom House, a press freedom watchdog. ""The Chinese government's refusal to grant access to these journalists reflects two important trends -- the Communist Party's expansion of its tactics for influencing media from Hong Kong to Taiwan, and the government's use of visa denials as a way to punish overseas news outlets for critical coverage,"" said Sarah Cook, senior research analyst at Freedom House. Taiwan's Central News Agency said Wang would address protecting the freedom of the press at the meeting. Beijing considers Taiwan a breakaway province and has never ruled out the use of force to achieve reunification. Taiwan also calls itself the Republic of China. Relations between the two sides have improved since Ma, of the Kuomintang party, came to power in Taiwan's 2008 elections.
