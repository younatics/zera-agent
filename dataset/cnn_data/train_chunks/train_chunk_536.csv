Missing: Schoolboy Anthony Stubbs, 16, went missing last month in Leyland, Lancashire amid reports of an argument with his girlfriend . The family of a school prefect who vanished only weeks after becoming a father aged just 16 has appealed for his safe return. Anthony Stubbs went missing last month amid reports of an argument with his teenage girlfriend. The schoolboy had intended to visit his mother's house but has not be seen or heard from since, despite it being only a ten minute walk away. The Year 11 pupil at Wellfield Business and Enterprise College in Leyland, Lancashire, became a father when his girlfriend Charlotte Mason, 18, gave birth to their daughter Lily in September. Anthony moved in with his girlfriend and child, despite concern from his family that the move could affect his schooling. Police today issued CCTV pictures of the schoolboy, who is due to sit his GCSEs next year, showing him only moments before he vanished. Anthony's mother Denise, 34, pleaded for her son's safe return, saying it would be the 'best Christmas present ever'. She said: 'Christmas is a time for family and all I want is for Anthony to come home. 'It is his daughter Lily's first Christmas and his little brother Oscar is missing him too - he should be here to celebrate with his family. 'Having Anthony back would be the best Christmas present ever. I am not angry with him; I just want him back. Please just come home.' She described his disappearance as 'really out of character' and said that her son had left home without his mobile phone or iPad. Last sighting: CCTV images capture Anthony Stubbs before his disappearance. He is seen walking near the Seven Stars public house in Leyland on November 25 at 12:55pm . Safe return: Anthony's mother Denise pleaded for his return saying it would be the 'best Christmas present ever' She said the ordeal had left his girlfriend 'devastated' and ruled out the possibility that the youngster had gone to stay with his father. She added: 'Anthony is so caring and kind - he would never just leave without saying something, especially with his baby at home. He's such a brilliant dad and loved being father to little Lily. 'Him going missing is really out of character for him. He was last seen on CCTV footage walking out his house - he was coming to visit me but he never arrived. It's only a ten minute walk. He'd come visit me every day. 'He even went without his mobile and iPad- they're at his girlfriend's. We are so worried and have been putting posters up in different towns but we've had no response. Couple: Anthony pictured with his girlfriend Charlotte Mason. The couple live together with their daughter Lily . 'He's not at his dad's either. I thought if he had a problem he would have been confident enough to tell us - that's why we can't understand it. He would have told us if he wanted to get away for a bit and said he was safe - and to stop making a fuss. Anthony found out he was going to be dad when he was just 15 and had just celebrated his 16th birthday when Lily was born. Worried: Anthony's girlfriend Charlotte Mason is said to be 'devastated' at his disappearance. Charlotte gave birth to their daughter Lily in September when she was 18 and he was 16 . His last confirmed sighting was on November 25 at 12:55pm, walking with a schoolbag over his shoulder near to the Seven Stars public house in Leyland. The day before he went missing Anthony failed to turn up at a ceremony where his grandparents were renewing their wedding vows. Denise added: 'When Anthony didn't come to the ceremony, I thought it was because he was busy at home with the baby; I didn't want to interfere. 'But on Sunday at about 4pm his girlfriend sent me a text to ask me when he was going back home to her - and that's when we realised he was missing. 'I waited until it had been 24 hours and then went straight to the police station on Monday because I knew then that something had happened. All sorts of things are going through my mind. We just want him home.' She added: 'He's very close with his cousin Katie and if he was thinking about running away I know he would have spoken to her about it. 'Nobody has heard from him, and we're just so worried. It's not in Anthony's heart to leave his family in this state. Anthony is such a caring person, he would help anyone out and he always looked out for other people before thinking about himself. 'He loves school and has got a baby girl and a girlfriend whom he adores and I just can't think of anything which would make him go. I don't believe he's run away. It's so out of character for him.' Appeal: Police missing poster for Anthony Stubbs . 'Even after he moved out, we still saw . him everyday. He would pick his brother Oscar up and take him to . nursery every morning before he went off to school. 'Oscar's only three and he keeps asking me why Anthony hasn't been coming to see him and take him to nursery. Out of character: Anthony's family became concerned when he missed a ceremony at which his grandparents were renewing their wedding vows . 'His sister Jodie is a similar age to Anthony, she's 15, and he was so protective of her. She's trying to cope but she just misses him so much. His girlfriend Charlotte is devastated.' Anthony's grandmother Maureen Jeffears, 53, said: 'Anthony has exams coming up but we think he was fine about them. I knew something was wrong when he didn't turn up to the ceremony on Saturday where we renewed our vows. 'We bought all our grandchildren a matching Cadbury purple tie but Anthony never came, even though he had been excited about it. His mother's fears for him are growing, she is in a bad way, but I am trying to keep positive. 'It is so out of character for him, he has never been missing before. He is a bright lad with a warm heart. Somebody knows where he is, please come forward so we can bring him home.' Det Insp John Entwisle of Lancashire Police said: 'Anthony has not made any contact with either his friends or family which is very much out of character. 'He has a three month old baby at home who we know he must miss and our main aim is to locate Anthony safe and well, and bring him home to his family for Christmas. 'I would urge anyone who thinks they may have seen Anthony or might know where he is to come forward and contact police.'

A man risked his life trying to save his daughter from a landslide, saying if he had to die it would be with her. Charlotte Blackman, 22, was walking on a beach with her family when 400 tons of rocks plunged down a cliffside and buried her. Despite his own injuries, her 45-year-old father Kevin scrambled over the fallen rocks to find her, an inquest heard yesterday. Helped by her boyfriend, 22-year-old Matthew Carnell, he tried to pull Miss Blackman clear but the boulders were far too heavy to shift. Tragic: Charlotte Blackman, 22, who died after tonnes of rubble crashed down on top of her during a coastal landslide in Dorset. An inquest into her death was held yesterday . At one point, warned that rocks were still falling, he said: ‘If I go, I want to go with my daughter.’ Mr Carnell had managed to save Miss . Blackman’s 12-year-old brother Mitchell by pulling him into the sea at . Freshwater Beach in Dorset. He said she had been just 10ft from them – . and from safety. It took nine hours for emergency workers to free Miss Blackman and she was declared dead at the scene. David Warren, a passing canoeist who . had just seen three smaller landslides on the same stretch of the . Jurassic Coast, had tried to warn the group not to go near the cliff . only seconds before it gave way. Charlotte's boyfriend Matthew Carnell pictured centre alongside family arriving at the inquest into his girlfriend's death yesterday. Her father is pictured centre back . Charlotte's mother Rachel pictured yesterday in blue as she attended the inquest into her daughter's death . However, the family did not hear him . scream at them: ‘Don’t go up [the beach], the whole lot’s going to come . down.’ Mr Warren told the hearing he saw Mr Blackman and Mr Carnell . desperately trying to move the rocks after the landslide. ‘They were covered in dust. I pleaded . with them to get back,’ he said. ‘I screamed and shouted at them to get . back as rocks were still falling. Kevin said “If I go, I want to go . with my daughter”. I felt so helpless, it was a horrible feeling.’ Witnesses told the hearing at Dorchester County Hall the landslide sounded like gunfire. Tragedy: Charlotte Blackman and boyfriend Matt Carnell, who was rescued from the landslide that crushed her to death . Mr Carnell said: ‘It happened so . fast, it was the blink of an eye. We had no time to get out of the way. I grabbed Mitchell and ran a few metres into the sea. ‘With that, a large dust cloud appeared and it was impossible to see for 20 seconds. ‘I turned to the area where the cliff face fell, boulders the size of a hay stack. I couldn’t see Charlotte. ‘It was complete chaos. I was in a panic and all I could think about was to get Charlotte out of there.’ 'We began to shout her name and move boulders out of the way. 'I would estimate the height of the boulders which had fallen and stacked on top of each other as higher than 10ft,' he added. 'I can only describe it as being complete chaos. Charlotte, a 'lively, fun-loving woman, who had her whole life in front of her' 'I was in a panic, all I could think of was to find Charlotte and get her out of there. 'I didn't want to leave without her.' 'I remember seeing two little stones, no bigger than a 10p piece. Then the whole lot came down.' Asked by the coroner if there were any signs of cliff fall, Mr Carnell said: 'There were a few boulders but they looked like they had been there for years.' David Warren, from Swindon, was two . weeks into a caravan holiday with wife Ann when he saw three landslides . from his canoe around lunchtime. He said he went to the beach . following the landslips to try to warn people not to walk along the . front where the rocks had fallen. Mr Warren said he saw Charlotte and her family further down the beach. 'I shouted to them that it was unsafe,' he said. Charlotte's devastated father, Kevin, . said they had not heard any warnings or been aware of any landslides in . the minutes before his daughter died. 'If I had seen any landslides I would not have taken my kids down the beach,' he said. Frantic efforts by rescuers, . including an Urban Search and Rescue Team sent from Devon and Somerset, . were unable to save Charlotte's life. The body of university graduate Charlotte, a volunteer . with Derbyshire Autism Services Group, was recovered by rescuers, still . wearing her blue bikini, at about 9.30pm that night. Canoeist and witness David Warren pictured arriving at the inquest yesterday . The inquest heard how Miss Blackman was just 10ft from safety when she became trapped. It was initially thought that heavy rain and periods of strong sun were to blame for the landslide at the 160ft tall limestone cliffs at Hive Beach, which forms part of . Britain's Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site. However, Richard Edmunds, an earth . scientist manager for the Jurassic coast team at Dorset County Council, . said the section of cliffs was most at risk of undercutting by the sea . and had not experienced any major falls since 2004. He said: 'I would interpret that as the risk is a constant. '[Landslides] could happen at any time and are not necessarily weather-related.' The section of cliffs where Charlotte died has since been closed off, he added. Mr Blackman, a National Express coach . driver, said there should have . been a greater number of warning signs on the beach itself warning of . the potential danger of rockfalls. He said: 'We had been playing in a rock pool for about 45 minutes, . it was a perfect sunny day. 'If I had seen a landslide I would not have taken my family down there. I would not have taken my kids there. 'I wouldn't wish (what happened) on my worst enemy. 'No father or mum would take their child on to the beach if they knew danger was right in front of them,' he added. Miss Blackman, a care volunteer from . Heanor in Derbyshire, had been spending the day with her father, . brother, his school friend, and her boyfriend of around seven years when . the tragedy happened last July. Her mother Rachel had stayed at their . caravan park. Mr Blackman, a National Express coach driver, did not give . evidence at the inquest. However, earlier in the legal proceedings, he . said he did not think there were enough warning signs on the cliffs. The coroner, Sheriff Payne, said Miss . Blackman’s death could not have been predicted and added that the . National Trust, which owns a stretch of the beach where the tragedy . happened, appeared to be doing all it could to warn visitors of the . dangers. ‘Charlotte Blackman died as a result of an accident,’ he ruled. Miss Blackman had just gained a . first-class honours degree in education studies from the University of . Derby and wanted to teach.

Lord McAlpine has today settled his libel actions against the BBC and ITV after they wrongly implicated him in child sex abuse allegations . Lord McAlpine has today settled his libel actions against the BBC and ITV after they wrongly implicated him in child sex abuse allegations. The former Tory Party treasurer was . not at London’s High Court to hear solicitors for both apologise . unreservedly for the damage and distress caused. He was named online by dozens of people after Newsnight claimed that a senior member of the Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher had taken part in child abuse at a care home in North Wales. And he launched his case against TV after This Morning presenter Phillip Schofield accidentally flashed a list of alleged paedophiles to camera before handing it to a bemused David Cameron. His lawyers confirmed that the agreements involved the payment of £185,000 damages by the BBC and £125,000 from ITV, together with very substantial costs. Lord McAlpine is also said to be in . 'negotiations' with Sally Bercow,  the wife of Commons Speaker John . Bercow, after she allegedly sent a tweet linking him with the Welsh . care home scandal. He has asked for £50,000 in libel damages and an apology. He intends to hand all money to charity, it is believed. The peer’s counsel, Edward Garnier QC, told Mr Justice Tugendhat that the action followed a Newsnight broadcast in November about the alleged sexual abuse of boys at the Bryn Estyn children’s home in Wales in the 1970s and 1980s. Two victims claimed that they suffered abuse 'at the hands of a leading Conservative politician from the Thatcher years.' TV's This Morning included an interview with Prime Minister David Cameron by presenter Phillip Schofield, which referred to the Bryn Estyn scandal . George Entwistle being interviewed by John Humphrys on this morning's Today programme about the Newsnight error. The BBC has apologised 'unreservedly for the mistake' The item did not name Lord McAlpine, but the programme-makers intended him to be the target of the allegations, he added. 'Unfortunately, in fact disastrously, names had already been named. Throughout the day on November 2, Newsnight’s forthcoming report had been widely trailed on the internet. 'Furthermore, Lord McAlpine’s name had been linked to it. In the aftermath of Newsnight’s broadcast, Lord McAlpine was widely identified as the subject of Newsnight’s allegations. 'In short, Newsnight made the most serious of defamatory allegations about Lord McAlpine, tarring him as a paedophile who was guilty of sexually abusing vulnerable young boys living in care. 'Those allegations are untrue. 'As the BBC now accepts, they were utterly baseless. These disgraceful allegations should never have been made.' Lord McAlpine is also said to be in 'negotiations' with Sally Bercow after she sent allegedly sent a tweet linking him with the Welsh care home scandal . Sir Edward said that, before the broadcast, the BBC had not even contacted Lord McAlpine. If it had, he would have told them that he had never been to the home in question. Furthermore, it was only after the programme aired, that interviewee Steve Messham was shown a photo of Lord McAlpine. Having seen it, he immediately withdrew his allegations and apologised. Counsel said Lord McAlpine had nothing but sympathy for Mr Messham and for other boys who suffered abuse. And he wished it to be known that he generally held the BBC in great esteem. But Newsnight had broadcast the most highly defamatory allegations about him, which had not only caused him great distress and embarrassment, but had affected him to his soul. Sir Edward said that six days after the Newsnight broadcast, ITV's This Morning included an interview with Prime Minister David Cameron by presenter Phillip Schofield, which referred to the Bryn Estyn scandal. Schofield passed Mr Cameron a card containing a list of names which were continually associated with the allegations that he said he had found on the internet. Counsel said ITV and Schofield accepted that Lord McAlpine's name appeared on the list, which was briefly visible to viewers. Lord McAlpine considered that Schofield's statements and actions amounted to an encouragement, albeit unintended, to viewers to perform similar internet searches and thus caused other people to discover the link between the seriously defamatory allegations and himself. Up to 10,000 Twitter users are thought to have tweeted about the former Tory Party treasurer’s alleged – but subsequently disproved – involvement in child abuse. In total the peer’s lawyers have identified 1,000 ‘original’ tweets and a further 9,000 retweets, which is when a user re-posts a comment sent to them. They must apologise and agree to pay a nominal sum as requested to Children in Need, believed to be £5. On the same day as the broadcast, both ITV and Schofield publicly apologised but no public apology was made directly to Lord McAlpine until November 22. Notwithstanding that the allegations against him were shown to be false, Lord McAlpine understandably remained extremely hurt and distressed by the broadcast and was not prepared to allow it to remain unchallenged, he added. Solicitor David Attfield, for the BBC, said it withdrew the allegations unreservedly and apologised sincerely for the great damage and distress caused. 'Following the broadcast of Newsnight on November 2, the BBC realised that it had committed a grave error in broadcasting the report complained of. The disgraceful allegations should never have been aired. 'As a result, a week later, on Newsnight on the evening of November 9, the programme issued an apology to Lord McAlpine. It has also undertaken an internal review to look into what went wrong. 'The BBC is pleased to be able to take this opportunity to apologise to Lord McAlpine before the court. It accepts that it cannot put the clock back and wishes to express its genuine remorse for the harm it has caused him.' Ian Felstead, for ITV and Schofield, said they fully accepted and wanted publicly to state that there was no truth whatsoever in the allegations against Lord McAlpine. 'Mr Schofield sought to paraphrase a question that had previously been raised in the House of Commons and the fact that the list was briefly visible to viewers was entirely inadvertent, a mistake immediately acknowledged by ITV and Mr Schofield. 'Neither ITV nor Mr Schofield intended to make the allegations against Lord McAlpine referred to by counsel but they do accept full responsibility for the broadcast and the harm and distress caused to Lord McAlpine as a result.' On behalf of them both, he apologised unreservedly.","Former Tory Party treasurer was wrongly linked to abuse at a Wales care home .

Two fisherman rescued in the Russian wilderness ate the corpse of their . friend in order to survive after vanishing in one of the most remote . places in the world, it was reported yesterday. Alexander Abdullaev, 37, and Alexei Gradulenko, 35, were plucked to . safety by a helicopter having survived temperatures lower than -30C . three months after embarking on their Yakutia fishing trip. Police discovered fragments of a human corpse at their campsite, which . prompted officers to launch a murder probe amid cannibalism concerns. But officers now believe they ate the man after he died. Survivor: Alexander Abdullaev is one of two men suspected of resorting to cannabalism in order to survive . Warmed up: Alexei Gradulenko, 35, was plucked to safety by a helicopter having survived the temperatures . ‘During questioning, one of the witnesses testified that cannibalism did . indeed take place,’ a source close to the investigation told the . Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pranda. ‘It was not murder.’ The source added that Mr Abdullaev and Mr Gradulenko ate the man after . he died from the harsh conditions. The two survivors were not arrested . but had been treated as witnesses in a murder case. The group of four men went missing in August during their trip in the . Russian Far East, and these dramatic pictures showed two of them being rescued and . taken to safety at the end of November. Mr Abdullayev confessed that he and Mr Gradulenko fed themselves with . the flesh of Andrei Kurochkin, 44, for weeks after he froze to death, . investigators told Yakutia newsite NVPress.ru. Dramatic survival: The pair, who survived for three months, in their rescue helicopter in November . Found: The group of four men went missing in August during their trip in the Russian Far East . Mr Abdullayev was flown out by investigators to find the fourth man, . Viktor Komarov, 47, and they did discover the fishermen's UAZ jeep – but failed . to find Mr Komarov either alive or dead. The survivors strongly denied they killed their friends and claimed to . have left them at a deserted gold digger's house while they tried to . seek help, reported the Siberian Times earlier this month. Mr Abdullaev and Mr Gradulenko were found by the Sutam River around 155 . miles from the nearest town of Neryungri. The men had covered 94 miles . on foot after their jeep broke down. Reports of cannibalism have previously emerged in Russia during some of the darkest periods of the country's past. There were said to be instances of cannibalism in remote Gulags - the Soviet system of forced labour camps established under Stalin. In 1933, 6,000 people were deported en masse from Moscow and Leningrad to isolated Nazino Island in Western Siberia. The plan was for settlers to bring virgin land into production and ultimately become self-sufficient. In reality, they were abandoned on a desolate island with nothing to eat but flour, a few tools, and insufficient clothing. Already weak from the five day journey to the island, during which they received virtually no food, the settlers were given only flour to mix with river water upon arrival, and malnutrition and dysentery was widespread. Reports of people resorting to cannibalism in near anarchical conditions on the island were rife. Of 6,000 people deported to Nazino, 4,000 died. The devastating famine caused by the two and a half year Siege of Leningrad, which lasted from September 8 1941 until January 27 1944 and saw around 800,000 people starve to death, led to rumours and reports of cannibalism emerging after supplies of birds, rats and pets had been exhausted. During the winter from 1941 to 1942, there were reports of hungry gangs attacking and eating people. Police in Leningrad were said to have established a special unit to combat cannibalism, and 260 people were reportedly jailed for the crime during this period.

A century after it was last used a lost campsite from Captain Scott's doomed Antarctic expedition has been rediscovered. Professor Clive Oppenheimer, a volcancologist at the University of Cambridge, pinpointed the  remote site using original maps and photographs. It was last used 100 years ago by surviving members of the team that travelled to the Antarctic with Captain Scott. Discovered: Professor Clive Oppenheimer at Captain Scott's lost campsite that has not been used for 100 years . As it was: The original campsite photographed 100 years ago which was set up by the British Antarctic Expedition 1910-13 . Doomed: (l-r) Captain Laurence Oates, Captain Robert Scott, Petty Officer Edgar Evans; sitting (l-r) Lt Henry Bowers, Dr Edward Wilson . Scott and four companions set out to try and become the first to reach the South Pole. Although the team reached their goal on January 17, 1912, they arrived to discover they had . been beaten there by another team led by Roald Amundsen. The entire team of Captain Robert Scott, Captain Laurence Oates, Edgar Evans, Henry Bowers and Edward Wilson, died in March, 1912, during the 1,500km journey back to base. Base camp members were able to recover the bodies eight months later. Despite the tragedy, the surviving team continued to work and scaled the continent's second highest volcano Mount Erebus to complete a geographical study. The trip is historically significant as geologist Professor Frank Debenham had the idea of creating a polar research institute while on the trek. Now the camp the surviving team made on the peak's upper slopes has been re-discovered. All that is left of the original camp, right, is a stone circle left by Scott and his men . A document from Captain Scott's Antarctic expedition which has been used to re-discover his lost campsite . Professor Oppenheimer also used this original map to trace the camp . Prof Oppenheimer, who re-enacted the Scott expedition ascent, was working in Antarctica at the time and wanted to mark the centenary of the ill-fated mission. He painstakingly sorted through written accounts and pictures and managed to locate the camp within 24 hours of setting off from his base. He said he thought he was looking for a 'needle in a haystack' before noticing a gateway to a hidden area not spotted during his travels. He said it then took him just two minutes to find it. All that was left was rings of stones that the team built around their tents to keep the pegs firmly in the ground. The rest of the camp had disappeared completely. Prof Oppenheimer said: 'I was tremendously excited to discover the campsite. In my mind's eye, I saw the four men fussing around their tent. 'Transposing again the historic photographs on the snowy stretch in front of me, I couldn't help smiling and saying ""hello boys"".' UK and New Zealand authorities are now working to get official protection for the site. Philippa Foster Back, granddaughter of Prof Debenham and chair of The United Kingdom Antarctic Heritage Trust said the discovery was ""wonderful"". She said: ""It is a reminder of both the dangers and thrills of Antarctic science and a fitting tribute to the great legacies of exploration and discovery left to us by all the brave men of that party.""

These conjoined twin brothers are lucky to be alive after being born sharing the same torso because of a rare one-in-a-million medical condition. Sohna and Mohna have defied all the odds to celebrate their ninth birthday despite their condition killing most at birth. In an orphanage in Amritsar, India, the pair go to lessons and live life to the full even though they share the same torso and two legs - each boy has their own two arms. A one-in-a-million chance: Sohna and Mohna suffer from dicephalic parapagus meaning they share the same torso and legs . The brothers are what is known as dicephalic parapagus twins and their amazing story will be aired for the first time in 'The Twins Who Share a Body - A Body Shock Special' on Channel 4 at 10pm tomorrow. The Indian twins are just one of a handful of known cases alive today in the world as more than half of twins with the condition are stillborn. They are growing up in an institution after being given up by their parents who were afraid they couldn't provide for them. Trying to lead normal lives: The boys live in an orphanage in Amritsar, India, and attend school every day . The pair go to school each day and both can read and write. As the remarkable documentary shows doctors are still unsure how the children cope so well with their condition. Following their journey, the show reveals some remarkable findings about how the boys live in one body controlled by two brains. Dr Rakesh Chouhan said: 'It's still a mystery and we're not 100 percent sure how these things are happening. Defying the odds: The brothers will soon celebrate their ninth birthday despite the majority of twins with their condition being stillborn . 'The most remarkable thing is two brains, single body being controlled separately and still they're a single unit.' Dicephalic parapagus is an extremely rare form of conjoined twins. Approximately half of conjoined twins are stillborn and the overall survival rate for conjoined twins is just 25 per cent. Twins with Dicephalic parapagus have an even smaller chance of survival as they share the same torso and it is impossible to separate them. Twins, such as Sohna and Mohna, share most parts of their body but think completely independently of each other. The birth of such twins is more common in south-west Asia and Africa. However, there have been instances of dicephalic parapagus twins in the West. In the U.S. Abigail and Brittany Hensel have become media celebrities, appearing on the Oprah Winfrey Show and featuring in television documentaries. The . examination even reveals Sohna and Mohna get sleepy at different times . and sense touch completely separately on their body divided exactly down . the middle. Nanny Parmjit Kaur said the boys had a fully individual sense of themselves. She . said: 'Sohna and Mohna think as two separate people. With shoes or . socks, Sohna will put on his own and Mohna will put on his own. They . will never put them on for each other. 'When they've been playing we tell them to wash their hands and legs. 'Sohna will wash his leg and walk away so we have to take Mohna back so he can wash his leg. That's how it is.' The documentary also follows conjoined baby twins Jesus and Emmanuel living in Brazil. Born deep in the rainforest, the six-month-old boys present medics with a battle to save them as the twins have just one heart between them. Like so many twins sharing so much the show discovers it causes medical complications as Jesus develops a collapsed lung. There is then the agonising moment the parents may have to decide if they should save one if the other dies. Medical miracle: Despite sharing the same body, the boys think independently, get tired at different times and feel sensation on different sides of their body .","Sohna and Mohna suffer from dicephalic parapagus - an extremely rare form of conjoined twins .

This is the horrifying moment gangsters chased and killed an innocent 17-year-old student after mistaking him for a rival gang member. CCTV footage shows victim Kwame Ofosu-Asare who was 'in the wrong place at the wrong time' running away from Nelson Idiabeta, then 17, and Nathaniel Okusanya, then 18. Moments after the teenagers were captured running after him and a friend, Kwame was stabbed 14 times in the back in a 'cowardly and merciless' murder. The 17-year-old was mistaken for a rival in a 'poisonous and senseless' gang war, a court heard today as Idiabeta and Okusanya were jailed for life. The pair were members of the TN1 gang - . Trust No One - out to avenge one of their numbers who was stabbed by a . rival gang member from the GAS gang - Guns and Shanks - just hours . earlier. His killers had toured housing estates . in Brixton to find rival gang members and came upon the 17-year-old son . of a sports broadcast journalist and his friend, who had nothing to do . with any gangs. Scroll down for video . CCTV footage shows Kwame Ofosu-Asare, in front of a friend, sprinting away from a pair of gangsters who were touring housing estates in Brixton to take revenge for one of their own being stabbed . Nathaniel Okusanya and Nelson Idiabeta are also picked up on the footage as they chase Kwame, who they mistook for members of a rival gang. When they caught up with him, they stabbed him 14 times in the back . Kwame, a business student, promising . footballer, a budding actor and rapper, was walking back with a friend . from a session at a recording studio when they were confronted by . Okusanya and Idiabeta in the Moorlands Estate in Brixton. Kwame and his friend with a 'sixth . sense' ran away into a cul de sac where his friend’s aunt lived in a . desperate attempt to get to safety - but she was not at home. His friend managed to jump over a wall but Kwame was trapped and then killed on March 2 of this year. He shouted out he was from Catford and pleaded 'I’m not from round here, I’m not from round here' but . he was murdered by the pair who had persuaded a shopper . to buy them at least one substantial kitchen knife just hours before . the attack. After an Old Bailey jury found the . pair guilty Nelson Idiabeta, now 18 was jailed for a minimum of 19 years . while Nathaniel Okusanya, 19, was jailed for 20 years. Sentencing Judge Richard Marks QC . said: 'I am entirely satisfied having heard the evidence the background . to this terrible offence is to be found in revenge between two gangs. 'Around 1.15pm Garfield Stewart a . member of TN1 gang was stabbed 28 times while sat in a bus while it was . stationary at West Norwood. Nelson Idiabeta, left, and Nathaniel Okusanya, right, of the Trust No One gang, were today jailed for 19 and 20 years respectively for the murder. Neither have shown an iota of remorse, said the judge . Kwame, a budding rapper, had been walking back from a recording studio when his assailants struck - he sought shelter at the home of his friend's aunt in a nearby cul-de-sac but tragically she was not home . 'It’s clear from the evidence a very . short time from that stabbing you found out about it and decided this . stabbing needed to be avenged. 'Your purpose was to carry out an attack on a GAS gang member and anyone you believed to be so. 'You encountered two boys Kwame and . his friend by reason of they only being on the Moreland Estate. 'You . believed them to be GAS gang members, they were not and have no . connection whatsoever with this gang.' He said Kwame’s friend managed to escape but Kwame 'was not so fortunate'. 'He was heard to shout ""I’m from . Catford"" saying to you he was in effect not from around there and had no . reason to be chased. It was to no avail. 'He was violently attacked suffering 14 stab wounds, three of which penetrated his lungs and one his liver. 'It would have been abundantly obvious to you he was gravely injured but you ran off thinking only of your escape.' He added: 'It was Kwame's misfortune to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.' But Judge Marks added Idiabeta, who was on bail at the time for robbery, and Okusanya 'have shown no an iota of remorse.' Crispin Aylett QC, prosecuting, told . jurors: 'Kwame's death was but a part of a poisonous and senseless feud . between two rival gangs of youths in south London.' Judge Marks said Kwame’s father, a . sports presenter in Ghana, described his son as 'vibrant, energetic, . enthusiastic and promising boy.' The father, in a statement read to . the court, added: 'Hours before his . horrendous death he had gone to the studio to record a track which he . dedicated to his mother. ‘The sudden and tragic death of Kwame . has deprived us of a brother, son and friend. 'He is ever present in our . minds. The damage Kwame’s death has caused the family is irreparable. Our lives have been ruined and will never be the same again.’ He was in the sixth-form of Forest . Hill School, had moved from Ghana to London in 2002, and excelled in sport, music and acting and had great . ambitions to make something of his life. Idiabeta, who was living at a bail hostel . in Camberwell,  had been in youth court . on the morning Kwame was stabbed for breaching his bail conditions for . robbery but the prosecution could not find his file so the case was . adjourned for a week. That day their friend Stewart was stabbed on the top deck . of a bus in West Norwood. Okusanya, seen here fleeing the scene, told police 'Stabbings happened everywhere... it's how life is now. Everyone gets stabbed, everyone gets shot. Everyone dies, everyone goes to jail, that's how life is' CCTV cameras recorded them travelling . to see him at King’s College Hospital before heading to a shopping . centre in Camberwell to buy a knife from a Bargain Express. When the shopkeeper refused to sell . them the weapon without seeing a passport or driving licence they asked a . stranger to help, claiming one of their mothers needed it for cooking. The pair then got a taxi driver to take them to Brixton and drop them off at the edge of the Moorlands Estate at 5.30pm. At that time Kwame, who lived in . Catford, happened to be walking through the estate with one of his . friends after leaving the recording studio. Garfield Stewart whose knifing prompted . the murder had been wearing a T-shirt which bore the slogan ‘RIP Little . Zac’ - a reference to Zac Olumegbon murdered eight months earlier in . July 2011. Okusanya had worn a similar t-shirt in . a You Tube video posted online which was entitled “Death Keeps Calling” and paid homage to Olumegbon. Jurors heard Okusanya was close . friends with Zac Olumegbon and starred in ‘Death Keeps Calling.’ When police searched his home they . found photos of three other murder victims - Abukar Mahamood, who was . shot dead aged 16 in 2007; Sadiq Adebeyi, 25, who was shot dead in May . 2011; and Nana Darko-Frimpong, 16, who was shot dead in June 2011. Okusanya told police they were all his . friends and added: ‘Stabbings happen everywhere... it’s how life is . now. Everyone gets stabbed, everyone gets shot. Everyone dies, everyone . goes to jail, that’s how life is. In a typical black area, people get . stabbed, people get shot, people die.’ Kwame Ofosu-Asare's uncle said today that the killers should serve the rest of their lives . behind bars to set an example to other gang members intent on violence. Alexander Asare-Ansah said no-body was safe until the message got . across. Speaking outside the Old Bailey he called for a tougher crack down on . gangs and their members as his nephew and his friend were innocently in . the area to use a recording studio and were attacked for no other . reason. He said: 'Something has to be done. As my brother said you don't need a . visa to go to that area. They just went there for a purpose. It may . happen to other people. Nobody is safe. 'All we say is life should be life for them. If not they will come out . and do it again. Life should be life so it sets and example for all the . other people.' Detective Chief Inspector John McFarlane said: 'Kwame was an entirely innocent young man with a bright future in front of him. 'He was selected at random, just . because he was walking through an estate deemed to be enemy territory by . these two violent gang members.'

Sandy Hook gunman Adam Lanza, 20, deliberately destroyed his computer's hard drive, erasing potentially valuable evidence, before going on Friday's bloody rampage. The FBI is trying to recover information from his hard drive, but has admitted it may not be possible as Lanza smashed it with a hammer or screwdriver and may also have overwritten it in a bid to hide his secrets. Cellphones and computer games have also been seized, but police have found no evidence to suggest that he was being treated with any drugs prescribed for mental illness. Crime scene: Investigators have trawled the Lanza's home for evidence and taken away his smashed computer, plus cellphones and video games . Adam Lanza, right, lived at the house on Yogananda Street with mom Nancy until Friday's massacre . 'The kid knew what he was doing,' a law enforcement source told New York magazine. 'This was a planned event. There is no question about it.' Lanza left no note or letter offering a motive for the killings, or explanation for why he targeted innocent school children. Investigators have trawled Lanza’s home for any hope of evidence which might lead to a greater understanding of what prompted his rampage. Connecticut State Police Lieutenant Paul Vance said investigators are examining 'anything that can provide us with information' about Lanza. Detectives are poring through his cellphone records and voicemails, viewing text messages and social network pages, hoping to find answers. They are also using search warrants to get medical records to determine if he was being treated for a medical or psychiatric ailment, and what, if anything, was prescribed, a source told Seattle PI. Much of the evidence seized involves . video and internet gaming material. According to a plumber who worked at the home in Newtown, Adam Lanza was 'obsessed' with weapons and violent video games such as Call of Duty.

Peter Wlasuk, 45, said the windowless basement, where Lanza's older brother had lived previously, was all but self-contained with computers, a TV, a bed, and a bathroom. The walls of the room, where he spent all his time, were covered with posters of guns and tanks from as early as the 1940s and another showed every piece of equipment ever made by the U.S. Mr Wlasuk said: 'The kids who play these games know all about [guns]. I'm not blaming the games for what happened. But they see a picture of a historical gun and say, ""I've used that on Call of Duty"".' Both the Lanza residence at Yogananda St and Sandy Hook Elementary School, above, will remain guarded crime scenes for the foreseeable future . Lanza's parents told friends and . divorce mediators that their son suffered from Asperger's syndrome, a . form of high-functioning autism, but it is unclear if he was ever . formally diagnosed. All of this information could be critical to determining what caused Lanza to shoot his mom, Nancy Lanza, 52,  four times in the head before then driving to Sandy Hook school and carrying out his horrific murder spree.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:39 EST, 17 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:51 EST, 17 December 2012 . Narcy Novack was branded cruel and sadistic and a coward by Judge Kenneth Karas . A woman who was convicted of orchestrating the beating deaths of her millionaire husband and mother-in-law was sentenced Monday to life in prison. The judge also called her a coward for skipping the court session. Narcy Novack, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., waived her right to appear at the sentencing, apparently in protest, and listened to it from a prisoner holding area in an adjoining room. Judge Kenneth Karas called it 'her final act of cowardice.' Novack did the same in June when she . and her brother, Cristobal Veliz, were convicted of hiring hit men who . carried out the 2009 beating deaths of Ben Novack Jr. in New York and . Bernice Novack in Florida. Veliz, of Brooklyn, also was sentenced Monday . to a life term. 'Because . of Ms. Novack's greed and her selfishness and what she thought was her . ability to manipulate other people, there are two innocent people - her . husband and her mother in law - who are dead,' the judge said. Ben . Novack, 53, was the son of the man who built the Fontainebleau hotel in . Miami Beach, a celebrity hangout in the 1950s and 1960s that appeared . in the movies 'Scarface' and 'Goldfinger.' He was beaten to death with dumbbells in July 2009 in his bed at a hotel in Rye Brook, N.Y., where his travel company was managing an Amway convention. A thug who admitted carrying out the killing testified that Narcy Novack ordered her husband's eyes sliced with a knife and offered a pillow to muffle his screams. Three months earlier, Novack's 86-year-old mother, Bernice, was killed in Fort Lauderdale by being clobbered in the teeth and head with a plumber's wrench. The killings 'involved particularly cruel, sadistic and gratuitous savagery seldom seen in the annals of crime,' prosecutors said when they called for life sentences. They said Narcy Novack feared that her . husband would divorce her, and that a prenuptial agreement would bar her . from the multimillion-dollar family estate. They said her motives were . 'hatred, greed and vengeance.' Couple: Nancy Novack pictured with her murdered husband Ben Novack Jr . Rebecca Bliss, a former prostitute and porn actress, testified at the trial that she was having an affair with Ben Novack when he was killed. She said Narcy Novack had offered her $10,000 to end the affair. According to Bliss, Novack said that, 'If she couldn't have him, no other woman was going to have him.' The judge said he could find no mitigating factors in Novack's life. 'There's really nothing to explain what she did,' he said. 'She lived a life of privilege.' Assistant U.S. Attorney Elliott Jacobson said Novack and her brother are 'pathological liars ... extraordinarily dangerous psychopaths.' 'The only sentence that would ensure the safety of the law-abiding community is a sentence that assures these two defendants will spend the rest of their lives in jail,' he told the judge. Novack's attorney, Howard Tanner, tried to get the judge to cap the sentence at 27 years, arguing that she had a lesser role in Bernice Novack's death. But the judge said, 'The fact she wasn't there doesn't mean she had a minor role.' He called her 'the person behind the scenes.' Protests: Narcy Novack, right, has repeatedly denied any involvement in her husband's death . Veliz's lawyer, Michael Keesee, also asked for a less-than-life sentence, and Veliz himself told the judge, 'I had nothing to do with this crime. I have never done anything wrong.' He continued to blame Narcy Novack's daughter, May Abad, whose two sons stand to inherit the bulk of the family estate, which included Ben Novack's large collection of Batman memorabilia. But the judge said Veliz 'literally provided the tools' for the killings and lied throughout his testimony. 'I've never seen anything like it,' Karas said. 'After he said his name, I'm not sure he said a truthful thing.' Novack did not testify. 'The two people who were mainly responsible have handled this in a pathetic and cowardly way,' the judge said. Legacy: Mr Novack's father Ben Novack Sr built the Fontainebleau Hotel on Miami Beach, a favorite of stars such as Marilyn Monroe and Frank Sinatra . In addition to the attacks on Ben and Bernice Novack, the defendants were convicted of domestic violence and stalking. Novack was convicted of money laundering and transporting stolen property, and Veliz was convicted of witness tampering. The attackers who cooperated with the prosecution have yet to be sentenced. Novack was fined $250,000 and ordered to pay more than $100,000 to her husband's company. Tanner would not say how Novack reacted to the verdict or why she left the courtroom. He said he will soon file an appeal of her conviction. 'She is still asserting her innocence,' he said.","Narcy Novack convicted of hiring hit men to carry out beatings .

A UK Independence Party candidate has sparked outrage by calling for discussion on whether unborn babies with Down's syndrome or spina bifida should be compulsorily aborted. Geoffrey Clarke, who will stand for Ukip in Kent County Council elections, has come under fire over his personal 'manifesto' which holds controversial views on disabled people, Muslims and immigration. Mr Clarke, who is also standing for Gravesham Borough Council in a by-election on Thursday, called for a Government review into NHS expenditure on his website. The review should 're-examine the . pregnancy abortion time limit. Consider compulsory abortion when the . foetus is detected as having Downs, spina bifida or similar syndrome . which, if it is born, will render the child a burden on the state as . well as on the family'. A local Ukip candidate (not pictured) has come under fire over his personal 'manifesto' which seems to hold controversial views on disabled people, Muslims and immigration. The party, led by Nigel Farage (pictured) has condemned the statements . It should also look into medical treatment for people over the age of 80, which the 66-year-old says is 'extraordinarily costly' to the NHS. This row will come as an embarrassing blow to the party, as polls show support for Ukip at a record high of between seven per cent and 14 per cent of the vote. But Mr Clarke said that he does not actually endorse the provocative statements on his website.'I do not endorse these ideas,' he said later. The views expressed by Geoffrey Clarke are a horrific reminder of the science of Eugenics. It advocated the use of practices which aim at improving the genetic make-up of a population, generally a human population. People who believe in Eugenics advocate for the improvement of human hereditary traits through the promotion of higher reproduction of more desired people. A reduction in reproduction of less desired people and traits is encouraged. Eugenics was at its most popular in the early decades of the 20th Century. It was practiced around the world, with governments, influential institutions and individuals promoting it. A number of countries introduced eugenics policies and programs which included genetic screening, birth control and marriage restrictions. Those targeted included the poor, mentally ill, disabled or promiscuous women. In some cases entire racial groups were targeted. An extreme case of this was the mass extermination of Jews by Nazi Germany. Eugenics was largely abandoned by the end of World War 11. 'They are for the commission to consider how best to cut service levels if it is decided to do so.' Learning disability charity Mencap questioned whether the candidate is fit for office after he made the comments on his website. Chief executive Mark Goldring said: 'Mencap is disgusted and horrified by the manifesto of Kent County Council Ukip candidate Geoffrey Clarke who has proposed the compulsory abortion of any foetus with Down's syndrome or spina bifida. 'Much has been written about the Paralympics this summer changing attitudes towards disabled people for the better. Yet in the very same year, a council candidate has proposed forced eugenics against disabled people. 'It is abhorrent that Geoffrey Clarke sees disabled people solely as a burden when people with a learning disability lead full lives and make valuable contributions to their communities and families. We question if he is fit for public office.' In his manifesto, Mr Clarke also says same-sex marriage is an 'abhorrence'. Population, immigration and threats to Britain's green belt are the three issues closest to his heart. A Ukip spokesman said they had now suspended Mr Clarke and if he was successful in the election he would not be representing them. He said: 'This is a personal manifesto. It is more of a shock to us than to anyone. 'He has now been suspended and will not be representing us in the unlikely event that he wins.'","Geoffrey Clarke, who will stand in Kent County Council elections, also appears to have controversial views on Muslims and immigration .

Thousands have claimed the most watched Sports Personality of the Year for 20 years was tainted last night as they could not vote because the BBC's phone system crumbled. After a vintage year of sporting achievement for Britain, Tour de France winner and Olympic gold medallist Bradley Wiggins won the prize with nearly a third of all the 1.6million votes. Almost 500,000 backed the cyclist - more than the total number of people who voted last year. But some of the 14.5million viewers have complained they had to call 100 times to vote once or failed to get through at all. Star: Winner of Sports Personality of the Year 2012, Bradley Wiggins, kisses the trophy after a landslide win - but thousands complained they could not vote . Instead they were forced to listen to an . engaged tone or an error message. 1. Bradley Wiggins 492,064 (30.25%) 2. Jessica Ennis 372,765 (22.92%) 3. Andy Murray 230,444 (14.17%) 4.

Others complained the 35-minute window for voting was far too short - which caused the logjam - and argued the format should have included text and online voting. One voter claimed he tried 100 times to vote for Andy Murray but could not get through, while another claimed she tried 61 times to vote for Nicola Adams. Another said it took 12 attempts for her vote for Jessica Ennis to register - although the problem calls probably would not have changed the result in the end. Alasdair Stephen tweeted: 'Tried voting for Andy Murray. 100 attempts but can't get through.' @Fletcherdene tweeted: 'Just tried voting for SPOTY & BT announced network is too busy. They need more lines available.' Charlotte Glass tweeted: 'What a joke, 1/2 hour to call vote for SPOTY and the lines are engaged. Who decided on this method of voting, why not text???' Mark Parry tweeted: ""Well that was ridiculous, voting lines only being open for 30 minutes. Why couldn't they have been open all show. I never got through.' Rags Martel tweeted: 'Great show by BBC - but telephone voting failed. Didn't get through once in 30 mins' while Sebastian du Feu said: 'If the voting just closed, how did they get a trophy to Miami and tee up Murray and Lennox Lewis? Bit odd.'

A sanctuary that has cared for unwanted animals for 64 years may be forced into the heartbreaking decision to put down all its dogs – because of one complaint about barking. Twin sisters Pat Hartley and Jane Wright have been issued with a council noise abatement order which they say they cannot afford to comply with. It means they must find homes for their 17 dogs or have them destroyed. They fear they may even be forced to close Mill House Animal Sanctuary, which is also home to 10 cows, 10 ponies, seven pigs, five sheep, five llamas and three goats. Tragic: Jane Wright of Mill House Animal Sanctuary admits 17 dogs like Polly face being put down because a council said their barks are too loud . The 70-year-old sisters say the complaint from a neighbour about the barking is the only brush with authority they have had since they started the sanctuary in 1948. Despite this, their local council issued the noise abatement order and told them to put up a soundproof perimeter fence. Unfortunately, their registered charity cannot afford to fight the order in court and doesn’t have the funds to pay for fencing. The sanctuary, in Fulwood, Sheffield, costs £3,000 a week to run and, although they receive donations, the sisters and their husbands prop it up with their own cash. Mrs Hartley,  whose husband Robert, 64, works as a driver, said: ‘We have a no-destruction policy. If we can’t rehome our animals, they stay with us until they die of old age. We have never turned any away. ‘But as things stand, we may have to put the dogs down and we could be forced to close for good. ‘We do not have enough funds to pay for a lengthy legal fight and in any case we feel the money is better spent caring for the animals.’ Mrs Hartley denied the dogs barked ‘all day, every day’ and insisted the sisters try to keep noise to a minimum. ‘We are in a quiet spot on a country lane, it’s not as if we are in a built-up area,’ she said. ‘The dogs do bark from time to time, all dogs bark.’ Attack: Patch may have to be destroyed before Christmas all because a single member of the public complained . Shame: The sanctuary cannot afford to fight the noise abatement notice brought against them, which makes the future bleak for animals like Alfie and 16 others . Home: The sanctuary has cared for thousands of animals like Sandy, pictured, since 1948 . Mrs Wright and her mechanic husband . Francis, 55, live in Mill House and say some of the dogs have recently . been moved from heated kennels to the house to reduce the noise to . neighbours. 'We have been here for 64 years and have cared for thousands of animals in that time – no one has ever complained before,’ Mrs Wright said. ‘We do our very best to ensure the noise is kept down. However, I have to concede that the dogs do bark from time to time. But it’s not like that all day every day as the person who has complained is claiming.’ The sisters say that, with Christmas approaching, they expect to have more unwanted pets to look after in the coming weeks. Home: The sanctuary has been asked to put up sound proof fencing - but they just can't afford it . Sad: The home, which has taken animals from all over Britain, has a no destruction policy but may have to shut leaving them with no other option . ‘We can’t turn them away. Putting up a fence is not a priority,’ said Mrs Hartley. The sisters lived in Mill House with their parents as children and were brought up with pet dogs and cats. In 1948, the family saved a young pony called Dolly because a neighbour was sending her to be slaughtered. She lived for another 25 years. The girls were only six when they took on Dolly and soon other unwanted ponies arrived and the sanctuary developed. Both sisters later had clerical jobs and used their money to run the sanctuary, which became a charity in 1982. Over the years they have taken in animals from all over the country, from the South Coast to the Orkneys. Heartbreak: Polly (left) and Poppy (right) and 15 other dogs face being put down thanks to the sole complaint . Cuddle: Rescued dogs Rocky (left) and Polly are cared for alongside a whole host of other saved animals . Desperate: Jane Wright holds Poppy and is keen to solve a problem that could lead to innocent deaths . Serious: Ossie, Patch and Polly are unaware that there lives could be short thanks to an order brought by one complaint . Mrs Hartley said: ‘We just love animals, we always have, and so did our parents. ‘When word got around that we had taken in a couple of ponies people starting contacting us about neglected animals and some were left at our gate. 'Over the years the animals took over our lives. ‘We don’t have the money to fight this case and we do fear the dogs will have to be put to sleep unless something can be done.’ A Sheffield council spokesman said: ‘A noise abatement order has been issued against the animal sanctuary. The owners initially appealed and then withdrew their appeal. ‘We are now working with the owners to help them comply with the order.’ Anyone wanting to offer a home to any of the sanctuary’s animals should call 07980 992589.","Mill House Animal Sanctuary faces closure after council court order .

"By . Becky Barrow, Business Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 17:54 EST, 17 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:01 EST, 19 December 2012 . The number of people surviving till the age of 105 or more has almost doubled in less than a decade, official figures revealed yesterday. There are 640 Britons who have reached that grand old age or greater, compared with 350 in 2002, the Office for National Statistics, reveals. The number of 'super centenarians' – which experts classify as aged 110 or over – were  unavailable but are also said to be rising fast. Experts predict Britain's ageing population will continue on the same trend, with more and more living far longer than their own parents or grandparents. While the extra years will be welcome to most, many will not have put aside enough to fund a long retirement or the periods of ill-health that can accompany old age. More are continuing in work after their official retirement date, with many finding that the returns on their pensions are far short of what they had expected. The majority of the 'super- elderly' are women, who normally live longer than men. Many wives survive their husbands by many years, or even decades. Of the 640 aged 105 and above in the UK in 2010 – the latest year for which figures are  available – 560 are women and 80 are men. The ONS also said the number of those who are aged 110 or more is rising 'year-on-year' in England and Wales, although  it does not have an exact number. Many pensioners prefer to stay active in their old age and choose to go back to work . Overall, the figures, published . yesterday, show there are 12,640 people in the UK who are aged 100 or . over. This is a record and a number that is rising sharply every year . because of improved medical treatment, better nutrition and rising . living standards. William . Hunter, founder of Hunter Wealth Management, said: 'The old adage . about  people living for ""three score years and ten"" is clearly over the . hill. 'Britons are healthier and living longer than ever before. But our finances are in much less rude health. 'As we live longer, pension companies are being forced  to pay out for longer, and  have of course passed those costs on.' Annuities – the income for life paid out by  an insurance firm when you cash in your pension pot – have dropped dramatically, forcing many older people to keep on working. Nearly one million pensioners are working in Britain, the  largest number since records began, according to official  figures published last week by the ONS. Over the last year, the army of so-called 'grey workers' has increased by around 100,000, equal to around 270 pensioners every single day. At this level, it means nearly ten per cent of those who are  65 and above have a job, with experts saying the number is almost guaranteed to keep on rising. For many pensioners, it is a positive choice. They enjoy their job, find it satisfying and are also keen to remain active in their old age. But many others are being forced into working – or even going back to work after retiring – because they simply cannot afford to stop. Laith Khalaf, a pensions  analyst at the financial advisers, Hargreaves Lansdown, said the message is simple – if you want to retire young, start saving. He said: 'Living to a ripe old age is a blessing if you can afford it – but a curse if you can't. 'The Government is unwilling to pay for an ever-increasing time spent in retirement. 'Those without sufficient savings will be left at the mercy of the state pension.' Overall, the ONS said a typical man lives until the age of 85 in England and Wales, while a woman will typically survive until the age of 89. Since 1960, the average life span has jumped by around a decade for a man and eight years for a woman, it said.","640 Britons have reached 105 compared with 350 in 2002 .

Almost 1,000 postal engineers and cleaners are set to strike across the country this Friday, December 21, which could delay deliveries of Christmas cards and online gift purchases. Postmen and postwomen are not striking, but it is thought some of them may not cross picket lines. The union members who clean, maintain and repair Royal Mail premises have voted 91 per cent in favour of strike action. Pictured: The Glasgow Mail Centre in Springburn. Almost 1,000 postal engineers and cleaners are set to strike across the country this Friday, December 21 . Friday's industrial action will mainly affect sorting office equipment, as there will be no engineers to fix machinery should it break down . The engineers and cleaners are employed by Romec, a company jointly owned by the Royal Mail and Balfour Beatty Workplace. Romec employs 4,300 people, including 1,000 technicians and 2,500 cleaners, and have a turnover in excess of £195 million. The strike action, which could disrupt online gift shoppers expecting parcels from Amazon and other retailers, centres on a row over pay rises, with Romec offering 1.5 per cent to their workers. In a statement, Communication Workers' Union national negotiator Ray Ellis said: 'The company’s behavior has been totally hypocritical and the workers are furious. 'We have been taking part in talks this week at the conciliation service ACAS and urge management to avoid the strike by upping their offer.' Billy Hayes, CWU general secretary, said: 'The whole union is behind the Romec workers.' In one of the biggest disruptions, Tube drivers will stage three strikes, including one on Boxing Day, in a row over Bank Holiday pay . Industrial action will also affect travellers this Christmas, as militant rail unions are set to stage a nationwide series of strikes. Walkouts are planned across the holiday period, as families visit relatives, shoppers flock to Boxing Day sales and fans travel to major sporting events. The strikes will hit CrossCountry trains from Penzance to Aberdeen, sleeper services between London and Scotland, the London Underground and the Newcastle Metro. In one of the biggest disruptions, Tube drivers will stage three strikes, including one on Boxing Day, in a row over Bank Holiday pay. Rail union RMT is also planning action on Friday against CrossCountry – which carries 90,000 passengers a day. It is in dispute with the firm over what the union claims has been a ‘comprehensive breakdown in industrial relations’ . In the North East, cleaners working for Churchill’s, the contractors, on Tyne and Wear Metro are to hold a 72-hour strike over low pay starting at 10.30pm on Sunday. In Scotland, RMT members working for ScotRail will on Friday hold the first of two 24-hour Christmas strikes over what the union says is ‘victimisation’ of one of its members.

A New Jersey man was grabbed by police at Newark Airport yesterday after police were tipped off that he planned to 'blow up' a Delta Airlines flight to Paris. But authorities now believe that the information, that came from the suspect's wife, was a false accusation following nothing more than a domestic dispute. The New York Post reports that Eunice Ukaegbu, 50, rang police on Okieze Ukaegbu, 58, because the couple had just had a big fight and she didn’t want him to leave the country without her. Argument: Okieze Ukaegbu, 58 and his wife Eunice Ukaegbu, 50, in happier times. She told police that he was a planning to 'blow up' a flight to Paris . Eunice told the Post that she just thought she was just acting on her civic duty. 'He told me he was going to blow up the airplane. I did what an honest citizen would do,' she said. The NJ nurse claims her husband 'is a little secretive.' Her story is that she first became concerned as Okieze had been acting distantly. When she couldn't open his suitcase, Eunice felt she had to warn authorities. Police and federal agents rushed to the Ukaegbu family home in Union, New Jersey, to question the possible 'terrorist.' Luckily for Okieze, the couple's daughter overheard the incident and rang her father to tell him that police were on the way to apprehend him at Newark Airport. Eunice Ukaegbu told authorities she her husband was 'secretive' while he claimed she had 'an alcohol problem' Okieze had already passed through security and was waiting for a Delta flight to Paris, the first leg of his trip to Nigeria. He remained at Gate B45 until authorities arrived, then calmly told them that his wife was lying and had an 'alcohol problem.' Police took Okieze in for questioning, pulled his luggage off the plane and checked it with bomb detection dogs. This caused the man to miss his flight but sources at the Post claim other travelers did not experience significant delay. After interrogation and searches, Okieze was released and cleared to take a later Delta service to Paris. While his wife claims she contacted police out of genuine concern, they don't believe her story. Authorities now say they plan to charge Eunice Ukaegbu.

Rogue chemists have been accused of acting like ‘small-time drug-pushers’ after they were discovered selling anti-depressants, sleeping pills and Viagra on the black market. Undercover reporters were able to buy potentially lethal substances such as Valium and temazepam from pharmacies over the counter without a prescription. The BBC Inside Out investigation last night revealed a dangerous trade where chemists are risking lives by selling patients prescription drugs before they have seen a doctor. Scroll down for video . Black market: Undercover reporters were sold Valium, opiates and other addictive and dangerous prescription drugs without prescription at nine pharmacies . Undercover: A BBC researcher buys a bottle of Oramorph - which contains the addictive painkiller morphine - without a prescription . The potentially lethal sleeping tablet temazepam was bought without advice on the correct dosage, while the anti-anxiety drug benzodiazepine – which doctors say can cause death if patients stop using it suddenly – and drugs that can be highly addictive, including Valium, were sold over the counter for as little as £85. A bottle of the powerful painkiller morphine was bought for £200, with the chemist allegedly telling the reporter posing as a patient to drink as much as he wanted. It is illegal for pharmacists to sell such drugs without a prescription unless it is a medical emergency. The maximum sentence for those convicted is two years in prison. Volume: The nine chemists at the centre of the BBC investigation sold the reporter hundreds of tablets, including 288 Valium in total . Trade: It is illegal for pharmacists to sell drugs without a prescription, with sentences of up to two years in prison if found guilty . Potentially dangerous: Both Viagra and Valium were among the pharmaceuticals on sale at the chemists . But the health regulator has taken only one pharmacy in England to a hearing for selling drugs without a prescription this year. Undercover BBC reporters visited the pharmacies and for some drugs paid more than 20 times the price it would have cost them using an NHS prescription, which costs £7.65 in England but is free in the rest of the UK. Nine chemists in west London sold the reporters 288 Valium tablets, 21 temazepam tablets, 294 antibiotic tablets, 24 Viagra tablets and a bottle of Oramorph painkiller. Silence: None of the nine chemists made a comment when presented with the footage . Chemists are allowed to sell Viagra over the counter – but only if the patient passes a series of health tests and fills out a questionnaire. Temazepam, which is popular with heroin users wanting to wean themselves off the drug, must be kept locked away due to its potential for abuse. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said people would be 'shocked to see high street pharmacists acting like small time drug pushers' Last year, 293 people died from misuse of anti-anxiety drugs - more than double the total killed by cocaine and ecstasy. Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham said after watching last night’s programme: 'People will be shocked to see pharmacists acting like small-time drug-pushers. 'This is unacceptable on every level, so there has to be a proper look at whether the system that regulates pharmacies is fit for purpose.' Dr William Shanahan, lead clinician at the Central and North West London NHS Trust, said: 'These pharmacists are electing to bypass the checks and balances of these potentially dangerous drugs and putting patients’ lives at huge risk.' Pharmacies are regulated by the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Duncan Rudkin, chief executive of the GPhC, said: 'We are already investigating a number of allegations that pharmacies in London have supplied medicines illegally.' The MHRA said: 'The evidence shown in the programme is clearly of concern and we will be working with the GPhC to further investigate this.' All nine chemists refused to comment when shown the undercover footage.","London chemists found to be selling antibiotics and drugs like Valium and opiates without a .

They say it's the most wonderful time of the year, but the week leading up to Christmas leaves many of us stressed out and sleep-deprived, research has shown. According to a new study, most of us will be wishing we could ask Santa Claus to bring us a few extra hours of precious sleep as the big day looms ever closer. A study found 45 per cent of Britons will lose 21 hours of sleep this week, while some women become so stressed out by festive preparations that when they do drop off they have Christmas-themed nightmares. Burning the candle at both ends: Many adults will stay up late into the night this week in order to finalise last-minute Christmas preparations . Nightmares: Some women become so overwhelmed by festive preparations they have dreams about being chased by giant turkeys, a survey showed . The survey of 2,000 adults found 45 per cent of Britons will survive on a mere five hours of sleep per night over the next seven days, as time is swallowed up by late night socialising, staying up to wrap presents, or lying awake fretting over getting everything organised for Christmas Day. 1. Being attacked by a gigantic turkey . 2. Being naked at the family Christmas meal . 3. Passionately kissing Santa . 4. Eating too much and turning into a Christmas pudding . 5. Having a showdown with the mother-in law . 6. Being attacked by a Christmas tree . 7. Burning the Christmas meal . 8. Being surrounded by elves . 9. Presents getting lost in the post . 10. Cooker breaks on Christmas morning . Not only do people go to bed later this week, four out of ten adults will rise an hour earlier each morning in order to fit more in during the day. When Christmas Eve comes around, a fifth of parents will work through the night making up stockings, assembling new toys, and carrying out last minute preparations. Sleep expert Chris Idzikowski, from the Edinburgh Sleep Centre, warned that sleeplessness could be as dangerous as drinking when it comes to driving or other activities that require total concentration. 'It is also advisable to drink less alcohol if you're sleep deprived as you will feel the effect a lot more,' he said. 'The more sleepy you are, the more potent the drink.' While both sexes are likely to find their normal sleep pattern disrupted this week, it seems women suffer the most from the 'stressmas' phenomenon. A total of 59 per cent of British women reported suffering high levels of stress in the week before Christmas, while 42 per cent declared that hosting Christmas was the most stressful job they had to undertake. Many women also find themselves enduring festive nightmares due to the combination of stress and sleep-deprivation, the study said, with typical scary dreams ranging from being naked at the family Christmas lunch to being attacked by a gigantic turkey. Fraught: The study showed 45 per cent of men think women make 'too much fuss' over Christmas and that they could do a better job of hosting . As if that wasn't enough, research also showed couples regularly end up rowing during the fraught pre-Christmas period. 1. Worrying about how to keep guests entertained over the festive season (32%) 2. Fretting that guests will think the house is dirty (30%) 3. Menu planning and cooking additional meals while guests stay over (29%) 4. Keeping the conversation going (28%) 5. Fear over a partner or children embarrassing them (25%) 6. The state of the spare room . 7. Worrying that a guest will hear partner’s snoring . 1. Plan ahead, think of what might happen on the day and predict what problems may arise and develop solutions to avoid them happening . 2. Give your guests a choice - don’t make people do things they don’t want to do . 3. Share out the responsibility, allow others to help on the day and make them feel involved - especially children . 4. The most important thing is to relax and have fun, make your expectations realistic, appreciate the time spent together with your family . The study found 45 per cent of men think women make far too much fuss over Christmas and make the day a lot more stressful than it should be, while 36 per cent believe they could do a better job of hosting the day than their partners - and that it would be stress-free. 'Stressmas': The survey found 41 per cent of women preparing to host Christmas fear their family and friends won't regard them as a domestic goddess . Meanwhile 85 per cent of women claimed men don't understand or appreciate how much work and stress goes into creating the perfect Christmas, and 41 per cent fear their family and friends will not regard them as a domestic goddess but criticise their hosting skills. Relationship psychologist Corinne Sweet said women should stop setting themselves impossible goals by aiming for a 'perfect' Christmas. 'Stressmas can be avoided,' she said. 'Prepare yourself psychologically by lowering your expectations, Christmas can't be perfect. 'Take time out every time you feel riled.' Ms Sweet also recommended taking a nap when the chance arises, as 'people are especially agitated on not much sleep'. 'Make space for yourself this Christmas, set boundaries with relatives and kids, and create some quiet 'me-time' to reflect on what the spirit of Christmas is really about,' she said. According to the survey commissioned by hotel chain Travelodge, a third of women get more stressed when they have guests staying over during the festive season than they do while cooking Christmas dinner. A quarter of female respondents said they enjoyed Christmas more then guests stayed just for the day rather than spending the night. A further quarter of women said they didn't like having guests to stay over because it means they can't watch their favourite television programmes.","45% of Britons will lose 21 hours of sleep this week in the run up to Christmas Day .

Nick Candy, 39, married former Neighbours star Holly Valance, 29, at a lavish wedding in Beverley Hills earlier this year. Theft: Financial controller Ross Smith was jailed for two years today for stealing from developer Nick Candy - who married actress Holly Valance this year . Smith's fraud was discovered after bosses uncovered a string of suspicious payments on company credit cards and launched an investigation. The Work in Progress Controller plundered client accounts linked to the £20m interior design of 15 apartments at One Hyde Park, where properties sell for up to £65m. Southwark Crown Court heard Smith, who earned £25,000 a year, blew the stolen cash on funding his lifestyle and settling debts.

Stunning: This Penthouse apartment at One Hyde Park is the most expensive property in Britain costing £136million . Fraud: Smith said stealing from the Candy brothers (Nick and Holly left and Christian and wife Emily right) was easy because they had 'lax' financial controls . Jailing Smith judge David Higgins said: 'In essence you stopped to sustained criminal wrongdoing to fund a lifestyle you could not otherwise afford and you did so in breach of the highest degree of trust. 'Your behaviour was routinely deplorable and deeply antisocial and if you choose to behave in this way then you must, of course, accept the consequences. 'I do accept that this is a sad case though I have to add how you could seriously have any legal or financial ambition with your attitude is far from clear. 'You did indeed show some promise which you have of course thrown away because of your moral turpitude.' Smith pleaded guilty to one count of fraud by abuse of position between July 1, 2009, and January 25, 2012 earlier this year. Jailed: Smith was sent to prison for two years at Southwark Crown Court for his £90,000 fraud . Prosecutor Usha Shergill said Smith's dishonesty was uncovered after he left his job at Candy & Candy in March 2012. She said Smith had been responsible for a number of client accounts which had 'substantial funds advanced to Candy & Candy' to pay for fixtures, fittings and equipment. He also had access to company credit cards, used by employees to entertain clients. The barrister said that after Smith left the firm's finance discovered around £1,100 of unauthorised expenditure on company credit cards team during a routine check. When confronted Smith claimed initially it was just £525 but later admitted to spending £948. He paid the firm £1,600 and wrote to Nick Candy saying 'I'm sorry for that, I was stupid'. A further investigation uncovered the true extent of Smith's stealing. Ms Shergill said: 'From April 2009 to January 2012 they identified a total of 26 credits to the RBA accounts in the name of the defendant. 'The credits totalled £91,849. 'It appears a total of £26,294 was credited back to Candy & Candy client accounts from Mr Smith's RBS accounts. 'What is outstanding is the sum of £65,555.' In interview Smith told detectives: 'I got in to financial difficulties for several reasons and I then realised how easy it was and how lax their financial controls were and I found it easy to do what I did'. For Smith, defence counsel Roger Sahota said his client had begun stealing to settle a £4,000 rent debt to prevent himself and his flatmates from being evicted. He said: 'Basically this is a tragic case, he is 26 now and was 23 when he began at Candy & Candy. 'He's a young man with some academic promise and he's basically thrown his future away'. Mr Sahota said Smith had not told his mother about his conviction because he was 'so ashamed he could not bear to break the news to her' and had not told his current employers.

This image released by the Swedish military shows the wreck of a Soviet submarine lost during World War Two as it lies on the bed of the Baltic Sea, 71 years after it sank . They said the submarine, believed to have been lost on patrol in late 1941, was found in the Swedish economic zone southeast of the Baltic island of Oland . It was an area which German forces had mined during the war. In a statement, the armed forces said: 'In the autumn of 1941, several Russian submarines left their home bases to patrol the Baltic Sea. 'Several of them never returned. One of them has now been found, blown up into large pieces, southeast of Oeland. 'There is much to indicate that the submarine headed straight into the minefield while on the surface and was blown apart by a mine.'

On its website, the military has posted a video and still images of the wreckage, which had broken into two large sections. The wreck was first reported by civilian divers during the summer months in the middle of this year. In the following months, Swedish submarine salvage ship HMS Belos confirmed the find and photographed it, the military said.

She was laid down on December 28, 1935, at shipyard in Stalingrad and put afloat on March 31, 1938. The submarine measured 77.80m long, had a crew of 50 men, was armed with 12 torpedoes and had a top speed of 19.5 nkots on the surface or 9 knots submerged. Location: The wreck was found in international waters in a heavily mined area called the Wartburg Minefield . On August 2, 1941, the submarine started on her last deployment to Bornholm Island when her contact was lost. S-class boats were the most successful for Russia during World War Two.

"Dookhan is scheduled to be arraigned Thursday in Suffolk Superior Court . By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 02:01 EST, 18 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:03 EST, 18 December 2012 . A Massachusetts chemist accused of deliberately faking test results on drug samples in criminal cases was indicted Monday on 27 charges, state Attorney General Martha Coakley said. Annie Dookhan, 35, of Franklin, was indicted by a grand jury on 17 counts of obstruction of justice, eight counts of tampering with evidence, perjury and pretending to hold a college degree. ‘We allege that Annie Dookhan tampered with drug evidence and fabricated test results on multiple occasions,’ state Attorney General Martha Coakley said. ‘Her alleged actions have sent ripple effects throughout the criminal justice system.’ Busted: Annie Dookhan was indicted Monday, December 17, 2012 on 27 charges, including obstruction of justice, tampering with evidence, perjury and pretending to hold a college degree . Doesn't stop here: Many more cases could be affected because authorities have said Dookhan tested more than 60,000 samples involving 34,000 defendants during her nine years at the lab . Dookhan's lawyer, Nicolas Gordon, did not immediately return a call seeking comment on the indictment. Dookhan is scheduled to be arraigned Thursday in Suffolk Superior Court. Her alleged misconduct led state police to shut down a state lab used by police departments to test drugs in criminal cases. Since the lab was closed in August, judges have released about 200 defendants from prison and put their cases on hold while their lawyers challenge their convictions. Many more cases could be affected because authorities have said Dookhan tested more than 60,000 samples involving 34,000 defendants during her nine years at the lab. Dookhan was first arrested in September on two counts of obstruction of justice and one count of pretending to hold a degree. She pleaded not guilty to the original charges and has been free on $10,000 bail. She has not publicly commented on the accusations. 'Ripple effects': Dookhan's 'alleged actions have sent ripple effects throughout the criminal justice system' state Attorney General Martha Coakley said . During her arraignment on the original charges, Assistant Attorney General John Verner said state police learned of Dookhan's actions after a chemist at the lab said he had observed ‘many irregularities’ in Dookhan's work. Verner said Dookhan later acknowledged to state police that she sometimes would test only five out of 15 to 20 samples but would list them all as positive for the presence of a drug. She also allegedly acknowledged that sometimes, if a sample tested negative, she would take known cocaine from another sample and add it to the negative sample to make it test positive. The only motive authorities have described is that Dookhan wanted to be seen as a good worker. An assistant district attorney in Norfolk County resigned in October after it was revealed that he received sometimes-personal phone calls and emails from Dookhan, a violation of protocols. When she was interviewed by state police in August, Dookhan said she just wanted to get the work done and never meant to hurt anyone. ‘I screwed up big-time,’ she is quoted as saying in a summary of the interview. ‘I messed up bad; it's my fault. I don't want the lab to get in trouble.’ Dookhan's co-workers began expressing concern about Dookhan's work habits several years ago, but her supervisors allowed her to continue working. She was by far the most productive chemist in the lab, routinely testing more than 500 samples a month, compared with the 50 to 150 tested by her co-workers. Dookhan was suspended from lab duties after she was caught forging a colleague's initials in June 2011. Career ambitions: The only motive authorities have described is that Dookhan wanted to be seen as a good worker . 'Messed up bad': 'I screwed up big-time,' Dookhan is quoted as saying. 'I messed up bad; it's my fault. I don't want the lab to get in trouble' She resigned in March during an internal investigation by the Department of Public Health. State police took over the lab in July as part of a state budget directive. Coakley said an investigation by her office revealed that Dookhan allegedly tampered with evidence by altering the substances in vials being tested at the lab to cover up her alleged routine practice of ‘dry labbing,’ a term used to describe visually identifying samples instead of conducting required chemical tests. Typically, drug samples are then sent for a second test. If the second test does not confirm the initial results, the vial is sent back to the primary chemist. Authorities allege that when samples were sent back to Dookhan, she tampered with the vials before resubmitting them to make them consistent with the inaccurate and positive results reached as a result of her ‘dry labbing.’ Coakley said recent testing done on these samples by the Massachusetts State Police Crime Laboratory corroborates the allegations. She said authorities allege that Dookhan obstructed justice by falsely certifying drug analyses when she knew the results were compromised. The drug certifications were submitted in court as evidence and relied on by prosecutors and defense attorneys. Coakley said Dookhan obstructed justice and committed perjury by falsely testifying during court proceedings that she held a master's degree in chemistry from the University of Massachusetts.

Actress Jessica Chastain is being praised for her portrayal of the dogged CIA operative who spent years tracking down Osama Bin Laden in the critically praised new film Zero Dark Thirty, but is the real life agent actually a man? 'The guy who was on the account from 2003 to May 1, 2011, when bin . Laden was killed, and the guy who was always saying ... that bin Laden . is living in the mysterious compound in Abbottabad — that guy is a guy, . he's not a female,' writer Peter Bergen told NPR. Bergen is probably the most well-versed person on the CIA's hunt for Bin Laden who isn't actually a employee at the intelligence organization. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . CIA: The film focuses on, Maya, the 'wicked smart' female CIA agent played by actress Jessica Chastain who was obsessed with catching and killing bin Laden, pictured . He's worked with CNN, once produced a . television interview with Bin Laden himself, and has written four books . since 9/11 on the hunt for the terrorist leader. Bergen called the gender change a 'literary device.' The role of the female CIA agent has the fictional name of 'Maya'. However, if true it calls into . question a Washington Post feature from earlier this December profiling . the 'female' agent Chastain's character was based on and her struggle to . get along with fellow agents. The story claimed the agent  was passed over for promotion amid widespread jealousy among her colleagues over her part in finding the terror mastermind. The agent also came under . investigation for meeting with the makers of the Hollywood film 'Zero . Dark Thirty' which chronicles the hunt for the al Qaeda leader. Government officials refused to confirm any information about the agent's identity in the Post story. According to The Washington Post, she . has been at the center of controversy during the promotion of the film, . and one of the clearest examples came after an email was sent . announcing that she won an award and dozens of her colleagues were given . less prestigious recognition. That was too much for her to bare. She reportedly sent an email . essentially saying: 'You guys tried to obstruct me. You fought me. Only I . deserve the award,' and sent it to the entire agency. The 'female agent' supposedly met with scriptwriter Mark Boal to . talk about her role in tracking bin Laden to his hideout in Pakistan, . which lead to the terror mastermind's May 2011 death. A US Navy SEAL team shot dead bin Laden in May 2011 after a stealth raid on his compound in Pakistan. In . the aftermath of the successful raid the unnamed agent was supposedly given much of . the credit for refusing to give up in the 10 year manhunt. The only identifying details in the Washington Post story other than gender are that the agent is in her 30s, has never been named, and still works for the spy agency in a counter terrorism unit. Women of the film: Chastain plays the lead . character (left) and said that she knew the film would be politically . controversial, while director Kathryn Bigelow (right) said that the . torture scenes were the hardest to film . But following the death of bin Laden, The Washington Post reports that she was widely expected to get promotion - only to be passed over. The agent is said to have angered many of her colleagues by sending out an email saying they did not deserve the same accolades as her for finding bin Laden. Although she was given a cash award for her work on finding bin Laden missing out on promotion is said to have cost her a rise of $16,000 a year. Integral: The real-life agent who spearheaded the raid is reportedly furious that other agents- who she feels slowed down the progress of the search- were given awards for their work . Propaganda: Osama bin Laden -- watching Barack Obama on television in Pakistan before he died . A profile of the agent in The Washington . Post said many of her colleagues were envious of the attention she . received from Hollywood. Star: Many in the CIA are reportedly envious of how the female agent is getting so much credit for the assassination of Bin Laden . 'She’s not Miss Congeniality, but that’s not going to find Osama bin Laden,' said a former CIA associate. Other colleagues said she had been treated harshly and had come under suspicion of cooperating too closely with the makers of Zero Dark Thirty, which opens in the U.S. on December 19th. The film has been tipped for Oscar success and has already won a host of critics awards. Besides new questions about the real life gender of the agent it's based on, the film has already generated controversy with the opening scenes showing terror suspects being waterboarded and US politicians complaining that director Kathryn Bigelow was given too much access. A spokesman for the CIA refused to talk about the agent but said many people were involved in the hunt for bin Laden. Spokeswoman Jennifer Youngblood said: 'Over the course of a decade, hundreds of analysts, operators and many others played key roles in the hunt.' The film's director Kathryn Bigelow has been quick to dole out praise to the unidentified agent, however. 'With her tenacity, her courage and her dedication, really drove that lead forward and gave it a lot of traction and the interesting thing about the movie is it puts you in her shoes,' Bigelow said during an appearance on CBS' This Morning. The Navy SEAL who wrote the controversial book detailing the assassination of Osama bin Laden credits a 'feisty' female CIA analyst for leading them to their target, after spending five years hunting him. Author Matt Bissonnette – whose identity was revealed even though he wrote the tell-all book under the pen name of  Mark Owen – only refers to the woman using the pseudonym ‘Jen’ in his book. Same inspiration? Claire Danes' character Carrie Mathison is thought to be based on the female agent who lead the search for Osama bin Laden, and she is also at the center of the upcoming film Zero Dark Thirty . The similarities between her backstory and that of the lead character in the hit television series Homeland are obvious. 'I can't give her enough credit,' he said during the interview. 'I mean, she, in my opinion, she kind of teed up this whole thing.' In his book, Bissonnette writes that he sat next to the woman during one of the long-haul flights as they headed to Pakistan for the mission, and his brief description paints a picture of a young and extremely dedicated analyst. 'Recruited by the agency out of college, she'd been working on the Bin Laden task force for the last five years. Analysts rotated in and out of the task force, but she stayed and kept after it. 'After the al-Kuwaiti phone call, she'd worked to put all the pieces together... she had been our go-to analyst on all intelligence questions regarding the target,' he writes. Even though the fact that the CIA is dominated by men is well-documented, it may be too quick to assume that the same ‘wicked smart, kind of feisty’ agent that Bissonnette wrote about was the basis for the lead character in the Golden Globe-winning series Homeland. However, actress Claire Danes hinted at a connection during an interview about the research she did to prepare for her role as Carrie Mathison. 'There’s a woman Carrie is loosely modeled on and she’s a CIA officer and so I met with her and she took me to Langley and introduced me to some of her colleagues,' Danes told The Wall Street Journal. The Homeland protagonist is described as being stubborn, headstrong, and outspoken. The same appears true for the female agent. 'Jen wasn't afraid to share her opinion with even the highest officers,' Bissonnette wrote in the book. 'This was her baby. Jen and her team spent five years tracking him to get us where we were now.' --- Meghan Keneally .

A father who admitted biting off another man's finger at a children's nativity play was yesterday told a jail sentence is 'almost inevitable.' Lee Wilkinson, 40, launched the attack on Michael Dent last December at Harton Primary School, South Shields, South Tyneside, following a feud between the men. It is believed Mr Wilkinson had started a relationship with Mr Dent's wife while the couple had split. The offshore worker, of Fulwell Avenue, South Shields, pleaded guilty at Newcastle Crown Court yesterday to unlawful wounding and a separate public order offence in relation to a run-in last Christmas Eve. He will be sentenced on January 25 and was granted bail. Judge Simon Hickey said: 'Custody is almost inevitable.' Mr Dent was not in court for the brief hearing yesterday. Wilkinson was originally charged with more serious offences but Neil Pallister, prosecuting, said the pleas to these lesser counts were acceptable. 'There is somewhat a complex background to the case,' he said. 'It is accepted that Mr Dent has too been cautioned in respect of assaults on the defendant Mr Wilkinson.

Tragic: David Bogenberger joined fraternity because he just 'wanted to fit in' Twenty two university students are facing charges following the death of a freshman who died after downing vodka in an initiation ceremony. In a two hour ritual David Bogenberger, 19, had to answer a series of questions at Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity in Northern Illinois University in exchange for alcohol. He was found dead the following day in his fraternity house bed with five times the legal driving limit of alcohol in his blood. The attorney of David's family told the Chicago Tribune the finance major just 'wanted to be liked'. Five leaders of the fraternity were charged on Monday with felony hazing by DeKalb County authorities. A further 17 members face misdemeanor charges. The fraternity stopped operating following David's death on November 2. The initiation was part of an annual ritual dubbed 'parents night' where new recruits are assigned to senior members and encouraged to drink excessive quantities of alcohol. David, from Palatine, Cook County, had made a pledge to the house so he could make friends. The family attorney Peter R. Coladarci told the Tribune: 'He wanted to be accepted. It's a classic case of a kid who just wants to fit in with the group.' Fraternity president Alexander M. Jandick, 21; vice president James P Harvey, 21; pledge adviser Omar Salameh, 21; secretary Patrick W Merrill, 19, and event planner Steven A Libert have all been charged with felony hazing. If convicted they face up to three years in jail or probation. In a statement released by police, David's family said they want to see 'significant change'. It read: 'We have no desire for revenge. We must realize that young people can and do die in hazing rituals. Alcohol-involved hazing and initiation must end.'

Mr Coladarci said the family are not seeking an 'eye for an eye' but said such college campus hazing incidents are a 'national health epidemic'. Police have accused the fraternity leaders had deliberately not told campus officials about the party so they would not be subject to inspections. Lieutenant Jason Leverton, of the DeKalb Police Department, said the group 'knowingly' did not register the event because of the quantity of alcohol they planned to consume. Mr Coladarci said one of the students, believed to be facing charges, call David's family to express his regret. Temporary sanctions have been placed on the fraternity by the university. The university has also announced disciplinary charges against 31 members, who are accused of breaking the student code of conduct.","David Bogenberger, 19, died after ritual at Northern Illinois University .

Charlie Brooks, 31, who plays Janine in the BBC1 . soap, had to choose from a selection of doors with different prices behind them, one of which was her seven-year-old daughter Kiki, but picked the wrong one.

The watchdog, which received 66 complaints . about the episode, will also look into whether the offence caused to viewers was justified by the . context. Ms Brooks told The Sun after the show: 'I signed up for this show, but Kiki didn’t. I didn’t want her to be so upset. I had no idea this was happening. It was my lowest point. 'My mum gave the green light for her to be there because it was an opportunity for Kiki to see me — and I think she thought she would.'

Ms Brooks said she felt as though she'd been 'kicked' when she realised what had happened and added that the incident was perhaps 'a step too far' by the production team. Charlie added: 'I kept picturing . Kiki’s face. She would have been excited about seeing me and nervous . about being on the show — and then disappointed when we failed the task. 'Afterwards . I went straight up and spoke to the show bosses. They said she ‘had a . moment’, but assured me she was OK after they gave her a bowl of ice . cream.'

Killer: Adam Lanza may have had a much broader plan when he forced his way into Sandy Hook Elementary School on Friday . The crazed gunman in the Connecticut shooting was carrying an arsenal of ammunition big enough to kill just about every student in the school if given enough time, according to police. Adam Lanza shot himself in the head just as he heard police drawing near to the classroom where he was slaughtering helpless children. He blasted his way into the building . and used a high-powered rifle to kill 20 children and six adults, . including the principal who tried to stop him. But now it has been revealed he had more ammunition in the form of multiple, high-capacity clips each capable of holding 30 bullets, raising the possibility Lanza had planned an even deadlier massacre and was stopped short. 'There was a lot of ammo, a lot of clips,' said state police Lt. Paul Vance. 'Certainly a lot of lives were potentially saved.' The chief medical examiner has said . the ammunition was the type designed to break up inside a victim's body . and inflict the maximum amount of damage, tearing apart bone and tissue. Mr Vance said that Lanza had 'hundreds' of bullets remaining when he killed himself in the school, and was in possession of multiple high-capacity magazines for all of the four guns he brought with him. Lanza had a Bushmaster .223-caliber rifle and two handguns on his person when his dead body was found by police, and he also had a shotgun in the car parked outside of the building. 'The Bushmaster was used in the school in its entirety and the handgun was used to take his own life,' Mr Vance said in a Sunday afternoon press conference. Speaking on ABC's 'This Week,' Gov. Dannel Malloy said Lanza shot himself as police entered the building. 'We surmise that it was during the second classroom episode that he heard responders coming and apparently at that, decided to take his own life,' Malloy said. Malloy offered no possible motive for . the shooting and a law enforcement official has said police have found . no letters or diaries left behind that could shed light on it. All . the victims at the school were shot with a rifle, at least some of them . up close, and all were apparently shot more than once, Chief Medical . Examiner Dr H. Wayne Carver said. There were as many as 11 shots on the bodies he examined. All six adults killed at the school were women. Of the 20 children, eight were boys and 12 were girls. Asked whether the children suffered, Carver said, 'If so, not for very long.' Asked how many bullets were fired, Carver said, 'I'm lucky if I can tell you how many I found.' Parents identified the children through photos to spare them some shock, Carver said. The terrible details about the last moments of young innocents emerged as authorities released their names and ages - the youngest 6 and 7, the oldest 56. Witnesses say Lanza was going from room to room shooting people, after first killing the principal Dawn Hochsprung and the school psychologist Mary Sherlach execution-style when they confronted him in the hallway . Adam Lanza shot his mother, Nancy, before driving to Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting 26 people including 20 children . They included Ana Marquez-Greene, a little girl who had just moved to Newtown from Canada; Victoria Soto, a 27-year-old teacher who apparently died while trying to hide her pupils; and principal Dawn Hochsprung, who authorities said lunged at the gunman in an attempt to overtake him. The tragedy has plunged Newtown into mourning and added the picturesque New England community of 27,000 people to the grim map of towns where mass shootings in recent years have periodically reignited the national debate over gun control but led to little change. Residents and faith leaders were sure to reflect Sunday on the mass shooting and what meaning, if any, to find in it. Obama planned to attend an interfaith vigil – the fourth time he will have traveled to a city after a mass shooting. On Saturday, overflow crowds packed St Rose of Lima Roman Catholic Church. The Rev. Richard Scinto, a deacon, gave a homily. 'In the past 48 hours I've said the phrase ""I don't know"" about 1,000 times,' he said. 'That not knowing has got to be the worst part of this whole thing.' Nancy Lanza's home in Newtown, Connecticut, was raided after 2 pm on Friday and she was found shot dead from an apparent gunshot wound to the face .","Governor implies that school gunman Adam Lanza killed himself and may have been stopped in his tracks before he could kill more people .

Brady and Hindley were responsible for the murders of five youngsters in the 1960s, sexually torturing their victims before burying their bodies on Saddleworth Moor. They were jailed for life in 1966 for the murders of Leslie Ann Downey, ten, John Kilbride, 12, and Edward Evans, 17. They didn't admit to killing Keith and another victim Pauline Reade, 16, until 1987. Hindley died in prison in 2002, aged 60. Keith was 12 years old when he was abducted on 12 June 1964, and was the only victim whose body has never been found, despite several large-scale searches of Saddleworth Moor.

'When she got to hospital, the cardiac surgeon said she was dying, and close to death.  She was only saved by his prompt action and that of others. 'They carried out immediate open heart surgery to repair the damage that you had done. 'As a result of that attack she has suffered lasting effects.  She has scarring, and suffers from nightmares.' The court heard Simpson charged at Miss Bailey and wrestled her to the ground in the middle of the street before stabbing her outside the gates of Abbey Hulton Primary School. She was rushed to hospital where she underwent emergency open-heart surgery for a damaged pulmonary artery. Her condition was so bad that members of her family were banned from seeing her for 24 hours as medics said the slightest infection could kill her. David Bennett, prosecuting, said: 'She was walking home on her own when she noticed the defendant. 'He raced towards her and wrestled her to the ground. He said, ""I'm going to kill you, you b***h"".' Jailed: George Simpson, 58, was found guilty at Stafford Crown Court . The court heard Simpson, of Bentilee, . Staffordshire, had lived with Miss Bailey for 18 months but she had . ended the relationship after he punched and kicked her in January 2011. But he refused to accept the relationship was over and continued to bombard her with jealous emails and text messages before the savage attack. He also wrongly accused her of cheating him out of thousands of pounds for work he claimed he had carried out at her home. Patrick Thompson, defending, said: 'He had only one caution against his name, and before this relationship he was of good character. 'Because of the stress he was experiencing, he was suffering from a mental disorder at the time. 'That is no defence, but that is something the court can properly take into account.' After the case, Detective Inspector Steve Maxfield, of Staffordshire Police, said: 'This was a premeditated attempt by Simpson to seriously injure his former partner due to ongoing difficulties in their relationship. 'Simpson was intent on harming his victim and used force as he inflicted several puncture wounds.'","George Simpson, 58, threatened to kill Carol Bailey outside primary school .

Retail therapy can cure many an ailment, and though the Romneys are multi-billionaires, they apparently find their source of comfort in the filled aisles of Costco. The former Republican presidential candidate and his wife were pictured shopping at their local bulk warehouse near their home in La Jolla, California on Tuesday. The couple stocked up on bottled water, pretzels, fruit snacks, Dixie cups and paper towels. They also seemed to be preparing for Christmas as their carts had a few rolls of gift wrap and a toy car that will likely be a present for one of their 18 grandchildren. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Unloading: Mitt and Ann Romney were pictured shopping at their local bulk warehouse near their home in La Jolla, California on Tuesday . Supplies: The couple stocked up on bottled water, pretzels, fruit snacks, Dixie cups and paper towels . No help needed: The former candidate and his wife were by themselves during the shopping trip, where they apparently got some Christmas supplies for their brood . Frequent shoppers: The Romneys have spoken repeatedly about their affinity for Costco . Overlooking no details, they even remembered to pick up a box of Bisquik for pancakes on Christmas morning. The Romney's fondness for the discount membership club is no secret, as they frequently talked about their trips to Costco during the campaign trail. Cynical political analysts cried foul, saying that the they were trying to use their mentions of the budget store as a way to help lessen the public perception that the former governor was out of touch with the 'common man' because of his great wealth. The family's affinity for the store seems genuine, however, as Ann repeatedly boasted that it was the easiest- and most fiscally responsible- way to feed her large family. Blending in: Mitt and Ann were both dressed down, though Ann accessorized her look with a hot pink scarf . No driver needed: The couple arrived in their own Audi SUV . What do we need? They both sported sunglasses during the visit, though Mitt decided to keep his on the entire time and Ann took them off while inside the store . Plan of attack: Ann Romney has previously said that she always thinks about what is the most strategic way to shop in the store before going inside because it can be overwhelming . When the couple's five sons, their wives and all of their children come over for dinner, the total number of Romneys at the various dinner tables can easily add up to 30 people. During an interview on the Rachael Ray show during the campaign, Ann told the celebrity chef how she always has her route mapped out before she goes in the store. 'Wholesale shops are big, you have to go with a game plan before you start,' she said at the time. Santa at work: Romney bought several children's toys during his visit, presumably for some of his 18 grandchildren . Spoiler alert: One of the Romney clan can expect a remote controlled car for Christmas . Trying to go unnoticed: Mitt kept to himself during the visit, but in spite of his hopes, the hat and glasses did not keep alert shoppers from noticing him . During that appearance, Ann talked a great deal about how she buys the store's produce- both fresh and frozen- and stocks up on desserts. But the pictures from their Tuesday trip to the California store reveal that she and Mitt focused more on the non-perishables this time. It looks like in addition to picking . up some Christmas presents for the kids, the couple may have also gotten . a puffy black jacket for Mitt, as one was seen hanging off the side of . his cart. He tried to blend . in during the trip, and was dressed casually in khaki shorts, a navy . athletic shirt a baseball cap and sneakers, but his black sunglasses . inside the store may have been a bit conspicuous. Ann . seemed relaxed but made less of an effort to blend in with the masses . as she accessorized her black leisurewear with a hot pink scarf. New attire: Mitt appears to have bought a puffy black winter jacket even though the California temperatures do no require one quite yet . Casual gear: Romney has not announced many plans for his life post-campaign, though he did just rejoin the board of directors of Marriott Hotels . About their business: The couple have led a low-key life since the election ended in November . Clean up: Aside from one 'exit interview', Romney has kept quiet as many commentators speculated on the demise of his presidential bid . Healthy: V8 juice drinks and Fruit Snacks were among the treats that they bought . Doing his part: Mitt returns the carts after he and Ann emptied their loot . The former presidential candidate has laid low ever since he lost the election, relaxing with his family in La Jolla, taking time out to see the latest edition of the Twilight saga and accompanying his grandchildren to Disneyland. Romney briefly popped back up on the political radar when he had lunch with President Obama in the White House last week, though he did not speak to reporters after the meeting and only one joint photo was released. As of Monday, Mitt officially has an income again, since he announced yesterday that he will be re-joining the board of directors of the hotel chain, Marriott. Board members receive an annual salary of $60,000 as well as $110,000 in company stock as compensation for their efforts. Mitt served on the board of the company from 1993 to 2002 when he resigned to serve as governor of Massachusetts. He re-joined the board in 2009 and resigned again in January 2011 as the campaign heated up with the seemingly-unending process of Republican primaries.

"By . Associated Press . UPDATED: . 17:44 EST, 8 February 2012 . A new passenger screening program to make check-in more convenient for certain travellers is being expanded to 28 more major U.S. airports, the government said today. There will be no cost to eligible passengers, who would no longer have to remove their shoes and belts before they board flights. The airports include the three used by hijackers to launch the terror attacks in September 2001: Washington Dulles International Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey and Boston's Logan International Airport. Screenings: Travellers deemed 'low-risk' will be allowed to keep on belts, shoes and jackets and leave laptops and liquids in bags . The Transportation Security Administration's program, already in a test phase in seven other airports, is the Obama administration's first attempt at a passenger screening program responsive to frequent complaints that the government is not using common sense when it screens all passengers at airports in the same way. Under the new program, eligible travellers have the option to volunteer more personal information about themselves so that the government can vet them for security purposes before they arrive at airport checkpoints. 'Good, thoughtful, sensible security by its very nature facilitates lawful travel and legitimate commerce,' Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said. The program works this way: Participating travellers will walk through a dedicated lane at airport security checkpoints. They will provide the TSA officer with a specially marked boarding pass. A machine will read the barcode, and travellers deemed 'low-risk,' will likely be allowed to keep on belts, shoes and jackets and leave laptops and liquids in bags when being screened. Announcement: TSA Administrator John Pistole (R) and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano (L) speak about the pre-screening initiative today at Reagan International . Expansion: Ms Napolitano (L) watches as Mr Pistole announces extended plans for the passenger pre-screening initiative from the Arlington, Virginia airport . Not everyone is eligible to participate in the program, which is already being tested at airports in Atlanta, Dallas, Detroit, Miami, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Minneapolis-St. Paul. Eligible travellers are some of those who participate in American and Delta airlines' frequent flier programs, as well as travellers in three other trusted traveller programs run by the Customs and Border Protection agency, which do charge fees to participate. About 336,000 passengers have been screened through the program since the testing began last year, according to the Transportation Security Administration. By the end of 2012, the government expects select passengers in frequent flier programs for US Airways, United and Alaska Airlines to be eligible to participate. The program is expected to be operating in Reagan National Airport near Washington, Salt Lake City International Airport, John F Kennedy International Airport in New York and Chicago's O'Hare International Airport by the end of March. 'We are pleased to expand this important effort, in collaboration with our airline and airport partners, as we move away from a one-size-fits-all approach to a more intelligence-driven, risk-based transportation security system,' said TSA chief John Pistole. Pistole has said he hopes to eventually test the program at all airports and with all airlines around the country, but that might take years. The program is expected to be operating in these airports by the end of 2012: Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport, Charlotte Douglas International Airport, Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, Denver International Airport, Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport, Honolulu International Airport, New York's LaGuardia Airport, Lambert-St. Louis International Airport, Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, Puerto Rico's Luis Munoz Marin International Airport, Orlando International Airport, Philadelphia International Airport, Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, Pittsburgh International Airport, Oregon's Portland International Airport, San Francisco International Airport, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Florida's Tampa International Airport and Alaska's Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport.","Airports include the three used by hijackers to launch 9/11 terror attacks: Washington Dulles International, New Jersey's Newark Liberty International and Boston's Logan International .

For a study has found this is when patients are most likely to miss their consultations due to Monday morning blues. Study author Dr Rob Jenkins, from Glasgow University, said: 'Mondays are worst for missed appointments. But over the course of the . week attendance steadily improves. Fridays have the fewest no-shows.' Not ready to face the world? We are less likely to attend appointments on a Monday . The scientists speculated that people find it harder to drag themselves out to an appointment straight after the weekend due to Monday morning blues. They therefore feel less able to cope with the prospect of being given bad news, having an unpleasant treatment, or even dealing with abrupt medical staff. However, by Friday the psychological boost of nearing the end of the working week boosted their resilience and so improved attendance. Dr Jenkins said: 'Recent psychological studies have shown that different days of the . week evoke distinct emotional responses. Mondays have the most negative . response; Fridays the most positive. And emotional tone brightens . steadily over the intervening days.' The team from Glasgow University . analysed the attendance records for more than 4.5million outpatient . hospital appointments across Scotland between 1 January 2008 and 31 . December 2010.

Friday could save the NHS tens of millions of pounds. Writing in PLoS One, Dr Jenkins said: 'If you could cut non-attendance by just a tenth – from 12 per cent to 10.8 per cent, you could save the NHS £60 million a year. 'It would also improve patients' health and reduce the risk of illness.' Co-author David Ellis concluded: 'A simple strategy for reducing missed . appointments could be to schedule appointments towards the end of the . week wherever possible. 'Interestingly, however, we found that hospitals tend to do the opposite - they load appointments at the start of the week.'","Appointments made for the beginning of the week were .

Schepis was arrested after the frenzied assault in Rome  following a drug-fueled night of Halloween partying in Rome. Schepis reportedly has no recollection of what happened. The victim, New Jersey-born Fabio Malpeso, 19, was awake and talking to police after the violent attack. Malpeso is a student at John Cabot University, an American school in the Italian capital, and the shocking attack came on the five-year anniversary of the stabbing death of British exchange student, Meredith Kercher - whose roommate Amanda Knox was convicted and ultimately exonerated in her friend's 2007 death.

American-born student who attends the same university. with both U.S. and Italian citizenship and was . arrested early on Thursday in the apartment they shared overlooking . the Colosseum. Malpeso had surgery for stab wounds to his lungs and other parts of his body. The incident occurred on the five year anniversary of the stabbing death of Meredith Kercher, who was killed on the evening of November 1, 2007. Her American roommate Amanda Knox and Knox's then-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were accused of Kercher's death and were convicted after a widely publicized trial in December 2009. Their convictions were eventually overturned in October 2011 and both were set free. Shocking scene: The victim's sister, Federica Malpreso (pictured left), and her boyfriend Andrea Rinaldi (right) were in the apartment when they heard a chilling scream and rushed in to find Fabio being stabbed . On Saturday, a judge confirmed Schepis' arrest and said he will decide in the next day on a defense request that . Schepis be held under house arrest. He . is currently in police custody as they probe the attack. Police have . said a motive for the attack is unclear, but they suspect ‘drug- and . alcohol-related delirium’ might be a factor. Attorney Vincenzo Comi, who represents Schepis, told NBC News that his client told the judge that he ‘did not remember anything of the episode.’ On the night of the incident, Malpeso, Schepis and two unnamed men went to a club called the Atlantic, where they were ‘drinking alcohol, smoking hashish and taking what he was told was ecstasy.'

In a message on the university's website, he said press or social media ‘rumors’ do not accurately reflect what happened, but offered no details. He urged prayers for the families of the victim and alleged assailant. European experience: John Cabot University is a private American liberal arts college in Rome.

A man who died after drunkenly falling into a pool during a lads holiday, may have been dragged in, it was revealed today. Shane Virmani, 26, who was not able to swim, was found drowned in a hotel swimming pool in Malia, Crete and it was first believed he had fallen in during an alcohol-fuelled party. However CCTV footage has emerged showing the supermarket worker from Romford, Essex, being pulled off the side of the pool. His grieving mother is now calling for justice for her son and for the Greek police to re-open the investigation into his death. Mr Virmani and dozens of fellow holidaymakers were holding an all-night party at a hotel pool on August 6 this year. Mr Virmani fell into the pool around 6am but his body was not spotted for a further 25 minutes. Hotel staff desperately tried to revive him, but to no avail. Prosecutors in Greece are currently studying the film and will decide whether to take legal action. An inquest in Greece heard that Shane, who had been staying with a group of friends, had drunk only a 'limited quantity' of alcohol. Three witnesses were interviewed by police after the tragedy, despite there being around 40 people in the pool are at the time of the incident. Shane’s mother Melanie Virmani, 47, a teaching assistant from Ilford, Essex, said today: . 'This feels like a bad dream.

Joan Burton's Department of Social Protection spent more than €5,000 on a lavish staff party just weeks before she introduced swingeing welfare cuts, the Irish Mail on Sunday can reveal. Guests at the Halloween night bash were treated to a €2,000 buffet and an array of drinks, from Californian wine to Jameson whiskey – all at taxpayers’ expense. Public money was even used to fund €1,000 worth of spot prizes for guests at the ‘retirement get-together’, which was hosted by department secretary general Niamh O’Donoghue. The event, at the Department of Social Protection’s Dublin offices, was held on October 31 – even as Ms O’Donoghue was helping Ms Burton decide which areas of social welfare should be cut in the Budget. Eventually, it was decided to cut child benefit across the board, and to take €325 from the annual respite grant for carers. This directly contravenes the Labour Party’s election campaign promise that they would not touch child benefit. These cuts have been widely attacked and led to Labour chairman Colm Keaveney voting against his own party’s ratification of the Budget in the Dáil this week. That rebellion, and Mr Keaveney’s subsequent expulsion from the parliamentary Labour Party, threatens to spark an all-out war in Labour, which could ultimately ­topple the coalition. Yesterday Mr Keaveney said he agonised over his decision but that two incidents in particular helped him make up his mind. In an interview with the MoS, he said that during a radio discussion, historian Diarmaid Ferriter posed the question: What does Labour stand for? ‘And I just sat back in the studio in the Dáil and said to myself… he is right. ‘I didn’t sleep from Wednesday to Thursday. On Thursday morning I rang somebody close in my family. I said to my mother, I’m not 100% on this. She said: “I was up in SuperValu and a woman broke down at the till. She hadn’t the money in the purse to pay for the basket of groceries.”’ Starter: Barbecue-glazed cocktail sausages and a selection of sandwiches (some gluten-free) were served . ‘It was a culmination of that and I said to myself, I have to do what’s right.’ Labour ministers, led by Pat Rabbitte, defended the cuts to the respite grant this week, saying that Ms Burton had done sterling work defending other areas of social welfare. Mr Rabbitte sneered over Mr Keaveney’s ‘struggle with his conscience’ and accused him of ‘pirouetting’ on the Leinster House plinth. He argued that in order to save the economy, everyone – even carers – needed to make sacrifices. However, Mr Rabbitte’s critics will be infuriated to learn that even in Ms Burton’s own department, similar sacrifices are not being made when it comes to entertaining staff (current and former) at taxpayers’ expense. At the party, there were four cases of red wine and three white, plus a single bottle of Blossom Hill Zinfandel . The total cost of this year’s party was €5,335.60, according to records obtained by the MoS. That represents an increase on 2011, when €4,618.80 was spent to hold the same event. The October 31 shindig is described in official documents as an ‘annual retirement get-together’. It starts with a Mass at St Mary’s Pro-Cathedral on Marlborough Street, for current, retired and deceased Department of Social Protection workers. Then staff are invited to eat, drink and be merry – without having to worry about the cost. Catering costs came to €2,990, according to receipts provided for the event, with the food and drink provided by JMW Catering. Finger food included smoked salmon, fish goujons and chicken satay, along with dessert for 240 people at a cost of €2,160. A total of €830 in drinks was purchased, consisting of three cases of white wine, four cases of red wine, two bottles of Jameson whiskey, a bottle of Smirnoff vodka, Bacardi rum and gin. Trays of Guinness cans and Heineken were also laid out, with the remainder of the bill made up of water and soft drinks. Spot prizes for the assembled guests were also provided courtesy of the taxpayer, with €1,000 spent on 18 One4all gift vouchers. Before the party even got started the department had spent €699.30 on posting invitations. The department explained this expense: ‘Invitations were issued through the department’s HQ post room. The expenditure is the franking costs to issue these invites.’ There is no invoice for this cost. Other bills included €20.80 for printing photos, €200 for a PA system, €16 on gift bags and candles, €7.50 on coat hangers and €2 for cloakroom tickets. Even the organist who provided the music at the Mass was paid for by taxpayers. A similar event last year – also at the end of October and also ahead of a raft of welfare cuts – cost €4,618, according to receipts. Indulgent: What shindig would be complete without some smoked salmon and a couple of slices of brown bread to set you up for a night's free booze? Catering for that event, provided in-house, came to €2,466 with a total of €1,800 paid out for food and the rest spent on beverages. Another €1,000 was spent on vouchers, around half of which went on One4all gift cards, with the rest spent on €50 gift cards for Arnotts and Clerys stores. The department said it was ‘of course appreciative of the current economic climate’ and had tried to ‘restrict’ expenditure. The department said: ‘All the arrangements necessary to facilitate the function are ­handled in-house by current staff, the catering is arranged with internal caterers at a reasonable rate, the department uses its own premises.’ The details: Apparently no party is complete without ¿7.50 worth of coat hangers . It also said the party was the only function provided and that other Christmas parties are paid for by staff themselves. Those affected by the cuts will garner little or no comfort from that fact. A large proportion of carers, for instance, could not hope for enough time off from their caring duties to even attend a Christmas party,  something that’s less likely after the Budget.","Public money used to fund €1,000 worth of spot prizes for guests .

He has made a name for himself as Britain’s least graceful loser. C. J. de Mooi’s rant on The Weakest Link (he described his co-contestants as ‘idiots’ before adding: ‘I hope they, their loved ones and all their pets die horribly in freak yachting accidents!’) earned him cult status. He later joined the experts panel on another hit BBC quiz show, Eggheads, and wrote a book called How To Win TV Game Shows. Despite his straight-talking, it is perhaps ironic that illness once threatened to silence him. C. J.’s problems began in 1998 when he noticed a small swelling on the left-hand side of the roof of his mouth. He didn’t visit his doctor because he assumed it was a harmless ulcer. But eight months later, it was obstructing his speech and preventing him from eating properly. ‘I was a typical male about the . situation – I was scared and I didn’t want to admit I might be ill,’ says C. J., 43. ‘I didn’t even dare look at it in a mirror until it . started to press on my tongue.’ Two . months later, the obstruction had swollen further, so C. J. went to the . A&E department at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London. ‘I . remember sitting in the waiting room for hours, wondering what the hell . it could be. I’ve never drunk, never smoked and I’m a vegetarian,’ he . says. ‘I was utterly terrified.’ Within . seconds of examining the growth, the doctor ordered a biopsy. C. J. was . kept in overnight for monitoring, and by the morning doctors had the . results for him. ‘The doctor asked if I wanted the good news or the bad news – naturally I opted for the former,’ he remembers. ‘He told me it wasn’t cancer. The . relief was indescribable. ’The bad news was that he would need the lump . removed immediately and that not only was the procedure risky, it would . require him being conscious throughout the operation. ‘The thought of having to be awake . during my own procedure made me feel sick, especially after I heard what . the surgery would entail,’ he says. The . benign growth had originated in C. J.’s nasal cavity and as it had . grown, it had pushed through the bony palate (roof of the mouth), which . is made of cartilage. At the time he believed it was the size of a pea, . but it was closer to the size of a golf ball at this stage because, like . an iceberg, the bulk of it  was hidden. To . remove it, surgeons peeled back the skin on the roof of the mouth and . sliced a hole 1½ in in diameter into the bony palate to tease out the . tumour. The procedure took two hours. Quiz king: C.J. de Mooi, second from left, appearing on BBC's quiz show Eggheads . Remarkably, C. J. – real name Joseph Connagh – was able to go home the same day and he claims the pain was hardly noticeable. ‘It was no worse than the dull throbbing that the lump had caused in the first place. Anyway, I was so relieved it wasn’t cancer, I overlooked any discomfort.’ The surgery, however, did not involve filling the hole. C. J. was advised to chew on the right side of his mouth and drink through a straw, and eventually, the cartilage and skin would grow back. However, it would take eight years before it was fully healed. ‘Nowadays, someone who had this procedure would be offered a variety of solutions to close up the hole, such as a prosthetic palate,’ says Mahesh Kumar, consultant oral and maxillofacial surgeon at the Hillingdon Hospital in West London. Mr Kumar warns people not to ignore growths because there can be disastrous consequences. ‘These tumours are often harmless but 50 per cent will not be – ignoring one is a risk not worth taking.’ Today C. J., who has moved from appearing in quiz shows into acting – he recently starred in a stage version of the thriller Deathtrap – remains spooked by his own incident. ‘My advice to anyone with any sort of abnormal growth is to get it checked out immediately, even if you’re scared,’ he says.","Eggheads' C.J. de Mooi's horror when he discovered a lump in his mouth .

A burglar who smashed his way into a sheltered housing complex and demanded cash from elderly residents has been let off prison after his victims accepted his apology. Lewis Burns, 21, switched off the CCTV, pulled his jumper over his face and broke a window with a fire extinguisher before climbing into the couple's home. He faced four years in prison after being traced by a blood stain, but his victims, who are in their 70s, decided to spare him jail after he kept out of trouble for six months. Burns, who was sacked from his job as a valve fitter after the break-in in Hull, had pleaded guilty to burglary at an earlier hearing this summer. He said he had been drinking and had mixed hayfever medication with the alcohol, which he said resulted in him having no memory of breaking into the Thornton Court housing complex. The couple, who are 73 and 78, were woken by the noise of the break-in in February this year and Burns repeatedly demanded they hand over their money. He only ran off when they threatened to call the police, but was later traced by blood he left at the scene. Samples matched DNA kept on the police national database, which Burns, of west Hull, had been placed on in 2005 after receiving a caution . Burns had been warned at a previous hearing he faced four years behind bars, but in the first case of its kind in Hull, Judge Mark Bury delayed sentencing him for six months to see if he could keep out of trouble. After he did, the female victim, who asked not to be named, said: 'I have forgiven him for what he has done. I accept his apology. 'He is only young and it sounds like he has been a good kid before. 'I have children and I wouldn't have liked to have seen them go to prison at that age.  Hopefully, this will teach him a lesson.' Scene of the break-in: Thornton Court sheltered housing complex in Hull . Judge Bury had asked police to contact the couple to see if they would be willing to meet Burns, who carries out voluntary work for the elderly, and accept his apology in person. Although the victims were too distressed to meet Burns, a father with no previous convictions, they agreed to spare him prison after hearing how he had kept out of trouble. Judge Bury gave Burns a 12-month community order and told him to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work. Speaking at Hull Crown Court on Friday, he told Burns: 'Despite preliminary suggestions these two unfortunate victims would be prepared to see you, they have not in any event decided to do that. 'I have no criticism, one can well understand their sense of terror at this offence. It seems to me you would have been able to give them some encouragement about the sort of person you are and the totally isolated nature of this offence. 'It is important you have not reoffended. I will honour the promise I made to you back in June. 'If you do not comply with the order then I will send you to prison. You can put this rather sorry period of your life behind you and live a law-abiding future, hopefully in work. 'The seriousness of the offence merits a prison sentence in the region of four years and that is what you can expect if you do not comply.' Burns earlier said he wanted to apologise to his victims in person. He said he had no memory of the burglary and only found out what he had done when he was contacted by police. Burns said: 'I couldn't believe I had done something like that and I felt so sorry for the victims. 'There are no words to describe what I have done.  I just want to apologise as much as I can.' Burns' barrister Paul Genney said: 'His victims agreed to see him but subsequently had second thoughts and decided against it. He has managed to stay out of trouble.' Burns pleaded guilty to the burglary, which happened on February 4, at Hull Crown Court.","Lewis Burns, 21, smashed window and terrified couple in their seventies .

Leeds City Council was fined almost £100,000 . after trying to save money by reusing envelopes - and then sending personal information about a child in care to the wrong person. Careless: The employee left documents including GP and police reports and allegations of neglect on the train when taking them home .

Plymouth City Council was hit with a . £60,000 penalty for another incident in which reports on two families . were mixed up after they were sent to a shared printer - bringing the total number of councils charged for Data Protection Act breaches to 19. A Devon County Council worker revealed the details of the alleged criminal offences and health problems of 22 people while compiling a report for an adoption panel. The council was fined £90,000 penalty for the mistake. Information Commissioner Christopher Graham said: 'It would be far too easy to consider these breaches as simple human error. 'The reality is that they are caused by councils treating sensitive personal data in the same routine way they would deal with more general correspondence.' Blunder: Child neglect allegations against parents of four were sent to a different family. File picture . The case in Leeds saw sensitive personal details about a child in care sent to the wrong person, disclosing details of a criminal offence, school attendance, the level of contact agreed with siblings and information about the child's relationship with their mother. The document was delivered to the wrong place because the council were re-using envelopes internally after they had been used for external mail, and the original address had not been crossed out. Leeds City Council chief executive Tom Riordan said: 'We take our data protection responsibilities seriously and regard any breach as unacceptable. 'We accept the findings of the Information Commissioner and although we have already apologised to the individual affected we would like to take this opportunity to do so again.' The breach at Plymouth City Council saw the wrong person receive information including highly sensitive personal details about two parents and four children. The breach occurred when two reports about separate child neglect cases were sent to the same shared printer. In Devon, a social worker used a previous case as a template for an adoption panel report they were writing, but a copy of the old report was sent out instead of the new one. The mistake disclosed personal data of 22 people, including details of alleged criminal offences and mental and physical health. Mr Graham added: 'Far too often in these cases, the councils do not appear to have acknowledged that the data they are handling is about real people, and often the more vulnerable members of society. 'The distress that these incidents would have caused to the people involved is obvious.' The Information Commissioner's Office said it was pressing the Ministry of Justice for stronger powers to audit local councils' data protection compliance, if necessary without consent.","Borough of Lewisham fined £70,000 after papers were left on train .

Motorists heading out today be warned – it is the most dangerous day of the year on the roads. On average the number of crashes will double but in the worst areas they are expected to increase nearly four-fold, a new report says. Data from the last four years shows that the worst accident hotspots include Brighton, Birmingham, London and Glasgow. Take care: Today is the most dangerous day of the year for British motorists, according to an insurance provider . The report, by Co-operative Insurance says: ‘December 17 is the worst day of year for car crashes. 'Bumps and smashes double in the week before Christmas. And Ford Focus drivers will be in more crashes than any other road user.’ The analysis of more than 200,000 claims shows they have increased by an average of 205% - or double - compared to a typical day of the year on 17 December in 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011. The data also shows that more accidents occur in the week before Christmas than any other week of the year - with claims up by 53% overall as the last-minute shopping and the Christmas getaway begins. It also highlights the UK’s accident ‘hotspots’, with nearly four times (3.7) as many crashes likely to take place in Glasgow on 17 December than the average UK town or city. It is followed closely by Birmingham (3.6), Uxbridge (3 times more than average), Ipswich (3), South East London (2.6), North London (2.5) and Brighton, which is twice as likely. They are followed in the danger top 10 by East London (2.3), Guildford (2.3) and Redhill, Surrey (2.1). Hurry: The 'Christmas rush' is believed one of the reasons behind the holiday spike in accidents. File picture . In Scotland after top-placed Glasgow where there a four-fold increase in accidents is expected, comes Motherwell (1.9 times the norm), Edinburgh (1.8 times) and Paisley (1.5 times). Grant Mitchell, head of motor insurance at The Co-operative, said: ‘Our data shows that people are more likely to be involved a car accident in the run up to Christmas than any other time of the year. ‘We believe this is down to a combination of the ‘pre-Christmas rush’ when everyone is going to the supermarket or to buy last minute gifts along with the fact that people also feel tired and sluggish from the Christmas party season, which makes it harder to concentrate on the road.‘ . He added: ’Of course, when these factors are combined with busy roads, bad weather and the fact that the days are at their shortest, accidents can and do happen.’ Smashes: Insurance claims rise an average of 205 per cent on this day every year . The report says Ford Focus drivers are most commonly involved in car crashes on 17 December, followed by Vauxhall Astras and Vauxhall Corsas. Mr Mitchell said: ‘We all have a lot on our minds in the run-up to Christmas, but it’s vital we don’t sacrifice the safety of ourselves, our families and other people as a result. 'Staying safe over the holidays is the most important thing, and by making a commitment to driving responsibly we can help prevent devastating tragedies on roads this Christmas.'","Crashes set to double on 'most dangerous day of the year'

(Posed by model) Many retailers have already launched online sales, including Next and Debenhams, while others are slashing prices in the high street. However, there is a separate and thriving voucher market operating via an estimated 200 UK websites and another 21 daily deal sites. Among current deals, The Body Shop’s voucher code offers a 40 per cent saving on orders over £5 including free delivery, while there is 15 per cent off all Homebase online purchases. BHS offers savings of up to 60 per cent on homeware, and fashion chain Phase 8 has up to 50 per cent off.

Innocent: Kenrick Wickham was mistaken for a crack cocaine dealer and murdered in West Dulwich, London, last year . Three members of a gang who executed an innocent man after mistaking him for drug dealer were jailed for a total of at least 81 years today. Anthony McKenzie, 23, Samir Yusuf, 24, and Devana Palmer, 21, were all handed lengthy prison terms for the murder of Kenrick Wickham who was shot in the back of the head as he begged for mercy. Mr Wickham, 36, who was also shot twice in the neck, was bundled into a black Audi A3 after being mistaken for crack dealer O'Neill 'Power' Miller in June last year. McKenzie was given the longest sentence for pulling the trigger in West Dulwich, London. Sentencing the trio, Judge William referred to the 'dreadful tragedy' that saw 26 adults and children gunned down at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut on Friday. He said: 'It does not need the dreadful tragedy of last Friday in America to remind us all of the almost limitless power of the gun to damage and destroy. 'Guns are not bling, they are not a designer accessory available to foolish young men to impress other foolish young men, they are killing machines. 'It must be clearly understood that those involved in the taking of guns onto our streets which are then used to kill face life changing punishment. 'As Kenrick Wickham had his life casually snuffed out, so those responsible for it will see their lives forever altered, and your families will never be the same. 'In so far as Palmer and Yusuf are concerned, the finger of you was arguably as much upon the trigger as that of McKenzie. 'Those who ally themselves with the carrying and using of guns must understand they face exactly the same consequences.' McKenzie, who was convicted of Mr Wickham's murder after a trial at the Old Bailey earlier this year, was sentenced to a minimum of 30 years behind bars. Palmer and Yusuf were convicted of murder following a retrial at Snaresbrook Crown Court. Palmer was handed a minimum sentence of 25 years, while Yusuf will serve at least 26 years in jail. Jailed: Anthony McKenzie, 23, left, and Devana Palmer, 21, right, were both jailed for the murder of Kenrick Wickham . Jurors were unable to reach a verdict on Kurt McLean, 27, in respect of the murder charge but he had already admitted plotting to rob the victim. McLean, a father-of-one, will not face a second retrial and he was sentenced to seven years and eight month in prison for his part in the robbery plot. Frightened West Dulwich, southeast London, residents heard shouts of 'murder, murder, murder' after Jamaican-born Mr Wickham was gunned down yards from his home in the early hours of June 23 last year. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Prosecutor Simon Denison QC said: 'He had been shot in close range, pleading for his life, before three bullets were fired in close range, one in the back of his head and two in the back of his neck. 'It is apparent that this was related to the trade in class A drugs, particularly crack cocaine. 'It became apparent that Kenrick Wickham may not have been the intended victim.' Hours before Mr Wickham's murder, Yusuf arranged to meet O'Neill Miller in Kennington to buy three ounces of crack, with a street value of around £2,500. He added: 'Mr Miller was staying with Mr Wickham in a flat in West Dulwich. Behind bars: Samir yusuf, left, was jailed for the murder of Kenrick Wickham, while Kurt McLean was jailed for conspiracy to rob . 'The drugs were to be taken out of the flat to the car waiting outside where a simple and quick exchange of money for drugs was to take place. 'But it was Kenrick Wickham, not O'Neill Miller, who took the drugs outside. 'It wasn't just Yusuf waiting in that car, it was a group of four people who were there, including McLean, Palmer and McKenzie. 'What O'Neill didn't know was that the defendants had no intention of buying any drugs. 'They were intent on robbing and, we say, killing O'Neill Miller.' Mr Miller saw his friend bundled into the back of the car and gave chase, the court heard. 'He jumped into his own car and drove to the end of the alleyway just around the corner,' said Mr Denison. 'He saw Yusuf's car and the defendants and McKenzie all out of the car standing around Kenrick Wickham. 'He saw McKenzie with a gun in his hand and he heard shots'. The defendants were arrested moments after the shooting. Justice: McKenzie was convicted of Mr Wickham's murder after a trial at the Old Bailey earlier this year, while Palmer and Yusuf were convicted in a retrial at Snaresbrook Crown Court . A blood-stained bullet that passed through Mr Wickham's head was discovered in the car, together with heavy duty handcuffs and a balaclava. The four defendants remained expressionless as sentence was passed today. Roy Ledgister, defending Mclean, said he was 'taken by surprise' by the firearm, of which he had no knowledge. 'This has been a real wake-up call for him and he is ready to turn his life around.' Richard Carey-Hughes QC, for Palmer, said there was a 'gulf' between his and Yusuf's actions compared with McKenzie's. Sally Bennett-Jenkins, defending Yusuf, added that he was a secondary party and criminally naive. Judy Khan, acting for McKenzie, insisted the killing had been 'spontaneous'. 'When the firearm was brought to the scene it was not the overt intention for it to be used - something arose to bring that about,' she said. McLean, of Oval, south London; Palmer, of Muswell Hill, north London; Yusuf, of Brixton, south London, and McKenzie, formerly of West Drayton, west London, all denied murder but admitted conspiracy to rob.","Anthony McKenzie, Samir Yusuf and Devana Palmer were jailed for murder .

The 93 arrests in seven provinces highlight the authorities’ struggle to smother internet rumours, which they believe threaten communist rule. The state media said the 93 people were arrested for 'handing out leaflets about the apocalypse and spreading rumours'.

A school where two-thirds of pupils speak English as a second language has celebrated a 100 per cent pass rate in maths and English tests for 11-year-olds. One in three pupils at the Thomas Jones primary in Kensington and Chelsea, has Arabic as their first language and more than half are living below the poverty line. But the 230 strong school has been judged 'outstanding' by education standards watchdog Ofsted in every aspect of education that it delivers. Head teacher David Sellens pictured with a group of school children from Thomas Jones Primary School. It has a 100 per cent pass rate in maths and English, despite two thirds of students speaking English as a foreign language . The pupils are given a good 'early grounding in the basics' of maths and English, and encouraged to read high quality literature, such as the works of Shakespeare and Tennyson, from a young age . Headteacher David Sellens said the school's success is in part down to the fact that most of the children start in the . nursery school at the age of three and get a good 'early grounding in the . basics' of maths and English. He told the Independent:  'It is a very important starting point for families - particularly . families for whom English is not their first language and where they’re . living in challenging situations. 'We had pupils from Palestine, Ecuador, Somalia, Kosovo, Serbia and Mongolia - a wide range of countries.' The self confessed 'fussy' head said he also insists on the best standards for his buildings and from his pupils in their manners, attire and demeanor. He said he 'insists on pupils making eye contact with people and greeting visitors with a . handshake.' The school is also 'big on homework' and students can find themselves with up to two hours a night. Thomas Jones has often topped the tables with a 100 per cent record in maths and English over the past five years. According to Ofsted the 'personal development of many of the children is at a much lower level than that normally found when children first start (in the nursery),'. But by the time they are ready to move on to Year One (for five-year-olds), they have 'attained expected levels for this age group and their overall achievement is exceptional.' Some of the 'quirks' of the school see year six students donning white coats during science lessons, happily throwing themselves into the role of laboratory researchers. In English classes they eagerly embrace the works of Shakespeare, poetry readings from Lord Tenyson and other quality literature - such as Lord of the Flies. The school has children from Palestine, Ecuador, Somalia, Kosovo, Serbia and Mongolia and one in three have Arabic as a first language . Emma Cook, the year six teacher who steered last year's 11 year olds towards their 100 per cent success rate, said it was about boosting the children's goals. She said: 'It's more about really giving them aspirations for the future, so during their lessons they become the scientist, or the historian. We are all striving for the best and we don't settle for anything else.' She said the children can often be heard talking about going to university or becoming barristers or doctors as they walk around the school. Most of the school's teachers are recruited straight from university, staying for a few years, before moving on to jobs outside London where homes are more affordable, he said. The school is named after Thomas Jones of North Carolina - an early 19th century anti slavery crusader.  Despite his own basic education he strived to emancipate and teach his own children. In the words of the Ofsted report: 'This outstanding school lives up extremely well to the reputation of its namesake who always strove for equal opportunities and who had the highest aspirations for his own children.' Pupils with English as their main language now form a minority in one in 13 schools, up from one in 25 in 1997.

A record one in six pupils at primary schools and one in eight at secondary don’t speak English at home. Pupils with English as their main language now form a minority in one in 13 schools – up from one in 25 in 1997. And for the first time this year, the number of non-native speakers topped one million for the first time, rising from 957,490 last year. The figures were released as part of an official census of schools taken in January. At some schools, dozens of different languages are spoken. A separate analysis released earlier this year showed how children who speak English as their first language are now a minority in more than 1,600 English schools. The number of schools where fewer than half of children are native speakers has virtually doubled in 15 years. The cost of educating a child with English as an additional language has been estimated at up to £30,000-a-year, against around £5,000-a-year for other pupils. Punjabi is the most commonly spoken language among pupils who do not have English as a first language.

Only nine states in the U.S. exercised the right to execute their prisoners this year - the lowest figure in 20 years - as use of the death penalty fades. A total of 43 inmates were killed across America this year, with Texas, Arizona, Oklahoma and Mississippi accounting for more than three-quarters of the executions. 33 U.S. states still have the death penalty although fewer and fewer are using it, according to a report released Tuesday by a nonprofit company that tracks death penalty data. 'There are still 33 states with the death penalty, but very few are actually regularly carrying out executions', said Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center and author of the report told Reuters. Forty-three inmates were also executed last year but across 13 states executed inmates. No more executions are scheduled for this year. Ohio and Florida each executed three inmates. South Dakota executed two, and Delaware and Idaho each executed one. All of the executions were by lethal injection. The US Supreme Court banned execution in . 1972 following a ruling that it constituted cruel and unusual punishment and violated the . constitution. It authorised its resumption in 1976 and states could decide whether they wanted it or not. Several states that traditionally have supported the use of executions carried out none this year. In the US, about 13,000 people have been legally executed since the colonial era. Virginia has executed a larger percentage of its population than any other state with a population of more than a million. Twelve people who have been sentenced to . death in Texas in the modern era have been exonerated. The use of lethal injection has become . standard. Other methods have included electrocution, firing squad, . lethal gas and hanging. There are more than 3,000 offenders on death row in the US . Virginia which has the second highest . number of executions behind Texas since it was reinstated in 1976 is one . state that decided against its use. North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana and Missouri recorded no executions this year. Mr Dieter explained that it is no longer seen as a appropriate punishment for a crime, but not for humane reasons, but rather the expense and the time it takes for them to take place after sentencing - up to 20 years in certain cases. Texas remains unwavering in its belief in the punishment where it is considered a fitting and 'constitutional punishment for the most heinous crimes', according to Governor Rick Perry's office . Connecticut,  Illinois, New York, New Jersey and New Mexico all recently repealed the death penalty, bringing the total number of states without the punishment to 17. Attempts to repeal it are expected in Maryland, Colorado and New Hampshire. In the US, about 13,000 people have been legally executed since the colonial era. Inhumane?

His bravery in defusing a huge hissing bomb that fell on a factory during the Blitz earned him a George Cross after ordering his fellow engineers to take shelter. But tragically, Sergeant Michael Gibson was killed along with his squad of six men a month later, when a live 550lbs bomb exploded as they were unloading it from a truck. His wife and children actually saw the fatal explosion from a few miles away as they made their way to an air raid shelter. Sgt Gibson was posthumously awarded the George Cross — the second highest award for gallantry after the Victoria Cross. The immaculate silver medal was bought in the 1960s by a private collector and following his death it has now sold at auction for a world record £93,000. An unidentified bidder purchased the medal for £78,000, though all the fees added on later bumped up the overall total. The previous world record for a George Cross was £86,000 paid for one awarded to Corporal James Scully who saved a family trapped in the rubble of their home in Liverpool after being bombed. Christopher Hill, of London auctioneers Dix Noonan Webb, which sold Sgt Gibson's medal, said: 'There is a growing appreciation for the George Cross, which is rarer than the Victoria Cross. 'They are equal in term of gallantry but in collectors' terms, the Victoria Cross has always been more desirable. 'The Victoria Cross is awarded for gallantry in the face of the enemy. The George Cross is generally awarded for cold-blooded gallantry, where you know beforehand the risk to life involved, as opposed to the Victoria Cross, which is in the heat of battle.' Sgt Gibson, of number 9 Bomb Disposal Company, Royal Engineers, was charged with making safe UXBs and mines that fell in the Warwickshire area in 1940. On September 14, 1940, he and his squad were sent to a factory in Coventry after a Luftwaffe raid left two UXBs in situ. While the area was being evacuated the first bomb went off, although nobody was hurt. The George Cross, pictured here with Sgt Gibson's Defence and War medals, is the second highest award for gallantry after the Victoria Cross . Sgt Gibson uncovered the second device under the rubble when he heard an ominous hissing sound coming from it. At this point, Sgt Gibson sent his men away and went to work on the fuse. The citation for his award stated: 'His prompt and courageous action saved a very dangerous situation.' Sgt Gibson was aged 34 when he was killed on October 18, 1940. The squad of seven men had recovered a 550lbs bomb from Coventry city centre and took it to the remote Whitley Common where it was to be defused.

Tony Blair yesterday delivered a series of thinly-veiled warnings to Ed Miliband over Labour’s positions on immigration, welfare reform and the Leveson Report. In a highly unusual intervention into British politics, the former prime minister declined to say whether he would campaign for the Labour leader at the next election expected in 2015. Days after Mr Miliband claimed previous Labour governments had done ‘too little’ to deal with the impact of mass immigration, Mr Blair defended his record and warned that debate on the issue should be ‘handled with care’. Warnings: Tony Blair, left, yesterday delivered a series of thinly-veiled warnings to Ed Miliband, right, over Labour's positions on immigration, welfare reform and the Leveson Report . Rejecting suggestions that it had been a mistake to open the door to migrants from new EU members in eastern Europe, Mr Blair said: ‘People look back and say you should have done more to restrict particularly Eastern European immigration. ‘I look back on that, and you can have a debate about it, but personally I think the Polish community contributes a lot to this country. In many ways immigrants do a lot for our country. They bring fresh energy, fresh initiative and I think it will be a sad day if we end up targeting them. ‘Of course it has to be controlled, and illegal immigration has to be tackled head on. But overall I think immigration has been good for Britain and most immigrants have assimilated well. So don’t make them a scapegoat for our problems.’ Mr Blair also insisted it was ‘obvious’ that major changes needed to be made to sickness benefits and suggested the ageing population meant a fundamental reassessment of the post-war welfare state was necessary. His remarks will be seen as a swipe at Labour’s stance on welfare. The opposition has criticised almost all of Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith’s attempts to trim the vast benefits bill, including increasing most working age benefits by only 1 per cent a year for the next three years.

He agreed with the main recommendations, and did not understand the ‘vehemence’ of objections to legislation to back up a more effective newspaper watchdog. But he added: ‘I think that the most important thing is whatever comes out of this is something that’s independent of government, Parliament and the media. How you do that, I am open-minded about.’ In another apparent warning to Mr Miliband, Mr Blair sided with David Cameron and London Mayor Boris Johnson by backing their calls for an end to ‘banker bashing’, saying the success of the City was critical to Britain’s attempts to emerge from the economic mire.

Tony Blair denied any knowledge of the use of torture in the War on Terror, but urged his critics to remember the ‘context’ in which the security services were operating. The former Prime Minister was challenged over claims his government was complicit in the extraordinary rendition of Libyan dissidents, who were allegedly tortured after being handed over to the Gaddafi regime. Last week the British government agreed to pay £2.2million to Sami al Saadi, 45, who was dispatched with his wife and four young children back to his native Libya where he was imprisoned and maltreated. The ‘rendition’ operation – conducted with apparent MI6 support – took place only three days after Mr Blair visited Libya for the now infamous 2004 ‘deal in the desert’ with Colonel Gaddafi (pictured). Today Mr Blair insisted he would not comment on individual cases. But he added: ‘It is just important that people remember that at the time our country was facing a very severe threat from terrorism and we were trying to protect our people and our troops. ‘Some of those organisations like Libyan Fighting Group were trying to recruit people to go and kill our people. ‘I don’t believe that anybody in government either condoned or turned a blind eye to the use of torture. We wouldn’t condone the use of torture of maltreatment of suspects at all. At the moment of time we were in a very, very tough situation.

Google has partnered with the Israeli government to put 5,000 images of the Dead Sea Scrolls online in full colour and high resolution. More than six decades since the discovery of the scrolls - and thousands of years after they were written - they are now finally available for anyone with an Internet connection to see. The digital library contains the Book of Deuteronomy, which includes the second listing of the Ten Commandments, and a portion of the first chapter of the Book of Genesis, dated to the first century BC. Scroll down for video . Online for the first time: The Dead Sea Scrolls are now available to researchers across the globe thanks to Google which worked in partnership with Israel to upload them to an online database . Israeli officials said this is part of an attempt by the custodians of the celebrated manuscripts to make them broadly available. They have been often criticised for allowing the artefacts to be monopolised by small circles of scholars. 'Only five conservators worldwide are authorised to handle the Dead Sea Scrolls,' said Shuka Dorfman, director of the Israel Antiquities Authority. 'Now, everyone can touch the scroll on screen around the globe.' Ancient meets the modern: The scrolls are the work of an ascetic Jewish sect who fled Jerusalem into the desert 2,000 years ago and settled at Qumran, near the shore of the Dead Sea . Considered one of the most significant archaeological finds of the 20th century, the scrolls are thought to be the work of an ascetic Jewish sect that fled Jerusalem 2,000 years ago and settled at Qumran, near the shore of the Dead Sea. Google says the new digital library took two years to assemble, using technology first developed by Nasa. The multimedia website allows users to zoom in on various fragments, with translations and Google maps alongside. Valuable: The scrolls are considered one of the most important archaeological finds of the 20th Century, and Israel had been criticised for allowing them to be monopolised by a small band of scholars . Google hopes to further expand its project. Two months ago Google launched a 'Cultural Institute,' a digital visual archive of historical events in cooperation with 17 museums and institutes around the world. 'We're working to bring important cultural and historical materials online and help preserve them for future generations,' said Yossi Matias, head of Google's Research and Development Center in Israel. 'Our partnership with the Israel Antiquities Authority is another step toward enabling users to enjoy cultural material around the world.' Anyone interested in the scrolls can visit www.deadseascrolls.org.il for a closer look. Discovered between between 1946 and 1956, the Dead Sea Scrolls are a collection of 972 ancient manuscripts containing parts of what is now known as the Hebrew Bible, as well as a range of extra-biblical documents. They were first found by shepherd Muhammed Edh-Dhib, as he searched for a stray among the limestone cliffs at Khirbet Qumran on the shores of the Dead Sea in what was then British Mandate Palestine - now the West Bank. The story goes that, finding a a cave in the dark crevice of a steep rocky hillside, Muhammed hurled a stone into the dark interior and was startled to hear the sound of breaking pots. Rich archaeological seam: Qumran cave 4, in which 90 per cent of the scrolls were found . Venturing inside, the young Bedouin found a mysterious collection of large clay jars, in some of which he found old scrolls, some wrapped in linen and blackened with age. The texts are of great historical and religious significance and include the earliest known surviving copies of biblical and extra-biblical documents, as well as preserving evidence of diversity in late Second Temple Judaism. Dated to various ranges between 408BC and 318AD, they are written in Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek, and Nabataean, mostly on parchment, but with some written on papyrus and bronze. The scrolls are traditionally divided into three groups. 'Biblical' manuscripts, which are copies of texts from the Hebrew Bible comprise 40 per cent of the haul. Other religious manuscripts, including known documents from the Second Temple period like the books of Enoch, Jubilees, Tobit, and Sirach, that were now included in the Bible comprise 30 per cent of the identified scrolls. The so-called 'Sectarian' manuscripts - previously unknown documents that shed light on the beliefs of Jewish groups of the time - like the Community Rule, War Scroll, Pesher on Habakkuk, and the Rule of the Blessing, make up the remaining 30 per cent. While some of the writings have survived as nearly intact scrolls, most of the archive consists of thousands of parchment and papyrus fragments.","Digital library has the Book of Deuteronomy and first chapter of Genesis .

Best friends: Alan Brown, left, and Danny Heumann, right, pictured back in school and prior to their accidents . Two classmates and best friends who suffered tragic accidents that left them both paralyzed as young men have shared a unique journey over the past 25 years and today they sit together as directors of the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation. Back in the mid-1980s, Danny Heumann, now 42, and Alan T Brown, now 43, were active young men with their whole lives ahead of them, but within three short years both were facing up to spending the rest of their lives in wheelchairs. Heumann was paralyzed at 18-years-old . in August 1985 in a car accident. In January 1988, Brown became . paralyzed, at the age of 20, as a result of a swimming accident. ‘We were 18-years-old, ready to live . life,’ recalls Brown, 43. ‘I would never think in a class of 70 kids, . that two kids, two best friends, were going to end up in wheelchairs.’ ‘We walked down the aisle together at . our high school graduation. That was probably the last time I saw Danny . walking,' said Brown. Just two weeks before he was set to begin his freshman year at Syracuse University, Heumann was injured in a car accident while serving as a camp counselor in the Adirondacks, New York state. ‘The driver of the car I was in was speeding around a curb,’ explains Heumann. ‘He was killed, the two others walked away without a scratch, and I broke my back and was paralyzed.’ When Heumann was injured, best friend Brown did all he could do to help his friend. ‘I would take him places, drive him around. Stuff I never thought I would be doing,’ said Brown. As they look today: Alan Brown, left, and Danny Heumann with his wife Lynn, right . But then Brown himself suffered a cruel twist of fate. Six weeks after he had helped raise $15,000 for his friend's new foundation, he was paralyzed while diving on vacation in Martinique. It was Jan. 2, 1988, little more than two years after Heumann's accident. On his 21st birthday, Brown underwent surgery to have two metal plates and 11 screws inserted in his C5 and C6 vertebra. In the years since their life-changing accidents, both men have worked hard and devoted a great of their time to raising funds and awareness about spinal cord injuries, mobility impairment and paralysis. It hasn't been an easy journey, relationships have been tested and Brown said his own marriage broke up as a consequence. He has two sons, while Heumann is married and has a young daughter. Both men were determined to lead full lives and not be treated as victims. 'He and I were put in chairs for a . reason,' says Heumann. 'I don't believe the man upstairs was satisfied . with our lives on foot. He thought Alan and I had more potential from . sitting in chairs with a broken neck and broken back.' Heumann started a charity to raise money for spinal cord research and also works as a motivational speaker for his company Heumannly Capable. He graduated from Syracuse University in 1991 and received his law degree from American University in 1998. Brown, left, plays ice hockey before his accident, while Heumann, right, continues to enjoy playing tennis . Both Brown, left, and Heumann, right, have gone on to have successful careers, Brown in PR and Heumann as a motivational speaker . Brown also established a foundation - Alan T Brown Foundation - to support scientific and medical research, he is also founder and owner of PrimeTime Public Relations & Marketing in Hollywood, Florida. In June 2007, Heumann's Foundation joined the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation. It is named for the actor Christopher Reeve, who was injured in a horseback riding accident and died in 2004. His wife, Dana, worked with him and chaired the foundation; she died in 2006. Heumann, who now lives in Michigan, also became a member of the Reeve Foundation's Board of Directors. In October 2009, Brown was elected to the Reeve Foundation Board of Directors focusing on the duel mission of the Foundation, Care and Cure. The late actor Christopher Reeve and wife Dana: Both Brown and Heumann knew and worked with both of them . 'I have pictures of us from before, . standing together,' says Brown. 'Now, we're sitting together and making a . difference in the SCI world.' Brown recently pledged to raise $250,000 - $25,000 for each year he has been paralyzed - for the foundation. His one-year campaign is aptly named the 'Power of We.' 'Spinal cord injuries don't discriminate. In one split second my life changed,' said Brown. An estimated 5.6 million Americans live . with some form of paralysis, according to Centers for Disease Control . and Prevention, and most, like Brown and Heumann, were injured when they were young.

A Russian space official has dismissed . British singer Sarah Brightman's plans to blast off on her planned . mission as a space tourist as a publicity stunt. The ex-wife of Andrew Lloyd Webber is treating her scheduled 2015 trip on a Soyuz rocket as a way of boosting sales of her latest songs, he implied. And the official claimed that despite a high profile announcement in Moscow, no contract has been signed for the 'I Lost My Heart to a Starship Trooper' singer to become a space tourist at an estimated cost of £30 million. 'It is very likely that the singer . made an announcement about her possible trip to the International Space .

The source further claimed it was . likely on the mission earmarked for Brightman's flight in October 2015 . all three seats would go to professional Russian cosmonauts. However, a representative said the official's claims were not true, and said that Ms Brightman was still due to become a space tourist. They said: ''As previously announced during the press conference Sarah is confirmed for a future orbital spaceflight mission to the ISS. 'The final scheduling of her trip to the space station will be determined by Roscosmos and the ISS partners.' Brightman, 52, underwent and passed . medical tests in Moscow earlier this year before last month confirming . her bid to fly to the International Space Station. Now the official has also expressed concerns over her condition in 2015 or later. 'It is not clear how the upcoming . three years, one of which the singer will spend in constant travelling . around the world, will affect her health,' he was quoted as saying.

Miss Brightman, who is estimated to . have a personal fortune of £30million, revealed her family had . reservations about her becoming a cosmonaut. She said: ‘I had to think about it . very carefully and take my family into consideration. When I told my . mother, it was very sweet. She shivered, but I told her the Soyuz has a . very good record and then she was fine.’ The singer will complete her training in an intensive five-week period before blasting off. With Nasa’s space shuttles now . retired, Russian Soyuz spacecraft are the only vessels currently capable . of carrying people to the International Space Station. As a result, . open seats available for tourists have been scarce in recent years. The most recent tourist on a Soyuz . was Canadian Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Laliberte, who paid around . £21.8million for his trip in 2009. Brightman, whose 1978 single I Lost . My Heart To A Starship Trooper reached number six in the UK charts, said . seeing fuzzy TV images of the first ‘bouncing’ human steps on the moon . in 1969 when she was eight years old inspired her to dream about . travelling to space. ‘It was something miraculous.

The family of music star Jenni Rivera are said to be disgusted over the gruesome video leaked on the internet which shows parts of her bloodied dismembered body strewn amongst the wreckage. The Mexican singer's family want the people responsible to be brought to justice after the leaked footage - which shows a severed foot with painted toenails - spread like wildfire across the internet. Two Mexican police officers were arrested yesterday for looting from the wreckage site. One of these officers is thought to have sold the images to the media. Though the video was not confirmed as being authentic, the Rivera family said they believe it is due to the items in the video and images of the mangled body parts. Scroll down for video . Corrupt cops? Two police officers guarding the site where Jenni Rivera's plane crashed on Sunday have been accused of stealing personal items belonging to those aboard the doomed flight . Large personality: Rivera, 43, seen here in Los Angeles in March, was very popular among Latin music fans . Loved ones: Rivera's family gathered outside of her parents' home near Long Beach, California, on Wednesday night for a press conference . It also emerged the company that owns . the luxury jet she was traveling in is under investigation by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, and the agency seized two of its planes . earlier this year as part of the ongoing probe. DEA spokeswoman Lisa Webb Johnson . confirmed on Thursday the planes owned by Las Vegas-based Starwood . Management were seized in Texas and Arizona. The agency also has subpoenaed all . the company's records, including any correspondence it has had with a . former Tijuana mayor who U.S. law enforcement officials have long . suspected has ties to organized crime. Sources close to the Riveras told TMZ . the family is appalled that anyone would even think about leaking . something like that, especially if it was a first responder. 'We're told the severed foot was the . most painful part to watch because Jenni was very particular about her . feet and toes,' the source said. The officers were caught after images of the crash site were found on one of the arrested officers' cell phones. The extremely graphic photos depicted . body parts and personal documents belonging to those aboard the doomed . flight, including Rivera, 43, a singer and reality star known as the . 'Queen of Banda.' The Spanish news agency EFE identified the arrested officers as Luis Antonio Ávila Moreno, 23 and Mario Alberto García Pacheco, 24. The items that the duo allegedly stole from the plane were not identified by investigators. As the issue of police corruption rears its ugly head, Mexican authorities hope to continue with the investigation of the tragic crash on Sunday. A person speaking on behalf of the Mexican Consulate in Los Angeles told TMZ: 'We have over 2,000,000 police officers [in Mexico], and unfortunately some of these officers have been corrupt in the past, but we cannot generalize that the whole force is corrupt.' The rep added: 'Mexico has been working very hard to make their citizens and tourists safe, however it is not fair to judge the whole tree based upon a few bad apples.' Scatttered: One of the officers was additionally accused of taking graphic photos of the crash site, including body parts, and leaking them to the media . The body of the singer and reality star from California was found in the wreckage along with the bodies of six others, including her publicist, lawyer, make-up artist and two pilots.

The singer's remains will be given to the family once the tests are completed in coming days. It was also revealed this week that Rivera was in the final states of buying the Learjet plane from business executive Christian E. Esquino Nunez, 50, who has a . long and checkered legal past. Corporate records list his sister-in-law . as the company's only officer, but insurance companies that cover some . of the firm's planes say in court documents that the woman is merely a . front and that Esquino is the one in charge. Esquino's legal woes date back decades. He pleaded guilty to a fraud . charge that stemmed from a major drug investigation in Florida in the . early 1990s and most recently was sentenced to two years in federal . prison in a California aviation fraud case. Esquino, a Mexican citizen, . was deported upon his release.

David Axelrod, President Obama's former senior campaign advisor, criticised the showing of 'shoot em up' video game adverts during the game after 26 people - 20 of them children - were slaughtered in Connecticut in what is the worst school shooting in American history. He wrote: 'In NFL post-game: an ad for shoot 'em up video game. All for curbing weapons of war. But shouldn't we also quit marketing murder as a game?' Adam Lanza, 20, broke into the school and mercilessly opened fire with two handguns and semi-automatic assault rifle. All of Lanza's child massacre victims were first-graders, aged six or seven. Seven adults, six women who worked at the school, plus Lanza's mother also died at his hands, before he killed himself. It is believed American politicians will discuss possible legislation to ban rifles and assault weapons with high-capacity clips like those used during the massacre inthe coming weeks. The nation's addiction to guns is likely to be addressed in coming weeks as new numbers reveal that more than 2 million guns were purchased in America in November.

The brothers' biggest acquisition was the fabled 62,000-acre N Bar Ranch, for $45 million. That deal made national news last year, partly because the property was then owned by software billionaire Tom Siebel. Another landowner the Wilks brothers have bought out is Theodore Roosevelt IV, who had a log lodge, timber and grazing land between the south and north forks of Flatwillow Creek. They also bought property from the Sunlight Ranch Co., owned by Earl Holding of Sinclair Oil. Forbes magazine quoted Staci Wilks, of . Wilks Brothers LLC, as saying the brothers like to spend their spare . time hunting and fly fishing with friends, family and corporate guests, . and that their ranch properties are used for farming, ranching and . wildlife management. Buying up big county: The N Bar Ranch in central Montana for $45million . This summer, the brothers hosted a barbecue at the N Bar Ranch headquarters, inviting the locals to eat, drink and chat. 'They seem to be really nice folks to . me, down-home and friendly,' said Tom Lowry, who owns ranch land at the . east and west edges of the N Bar on Flatwillow Creek. He went to the barbecue and talked to the brothers. 'Both of them were very cordial,' he said. Dan and Farris Wilks did not respond to a request for an interview with The Gazette. Dan . and Farris Wilks were raised in a working-class family. They started . out in a masonry business that their father founded and where they still . sit on the board of directors. In . 2002 they branched out into the oil business, starting a company called . Frac Tech. Their fortune came from selling their interest in Frac Tech . in 2011, a deal that was reportedly worth $3.2 billion. That sale landed . them on the Forbes magazine list of little-known billionaires, ranking . 312 out of 400 on the list. Their background in fracking - a way . to recover oil by injecting fluids underground under high pressure - has . made some Montanans suspicious that the brothers are looking for their . next oil play in central Montana. Another . possibility is that they - like other wealthy individuals - are parking . their money in a safe investment during a volatile time in the stock . market. Epic: Despite their million-dollar land purchases, the brother's own less than 1 per cent of Montana's vast land . Montana is 147,200 sq miles in size - meaning despite the Wilks brothers' significant land purchase, it is still less than 1 per cent of the state. If their acquisitions were simply for ranching and outdoor recreation, the Wilks brothers have a wide choice of where to go. They also are reported to have purchased land in Wyoming, Kansas, Texas and Idaho. In Colorado, Farris Wilks is said to have paid $16 million in June for the most expensive ski-accessible home in Snowmass Village - a seven-bedroom home on five acres in the ski town. Getting to their properties scattered across the United States is no problem. When the brothers visit Montana, their 18-passenger Bombardier Global Express corporate jet lands at the Lewistown airport, where they hop into a helicopter to fly to the N Bar. Pretty soon, though, the stop in Lewistown won't be necessary. The brothers this summer began building a 6,000-foot asphalt airstrip on a bluff across Flatwillow Creek from the N Bar Ranch headquarters. Besides a possible energy play, another rumor floating around Fergus County is that the Wilks brothers are looking to get rid of isolated Bureau of Land Management inholdings through land exchanges. Stan Benes, field manager for the BLM's Lewistown Field Office, said the agency is open to any proposals, but is quick to add that any propositions would have to go through public scrutiny. 'We have to make absolutely certain it's in the public's best interest,' Benes said. The BLM owns about 2,500 acres in the Durfee Hills that are landlocked within the N Bar with no road access. 'If we could trade that for another place we could gain some access,' Benes said. 'That would be worth consideration.' Benes said some pilots fly to the inholding to hunt. When one pilot wrecked his plane, he had to hire a helicopter to remove the damaged aircraft because there was no road access. Here's how the Wilks brothers land purchases stack up, according to the state Natural Resource Information System. The majority of their land buys have been in Fergus County, some of them adjacent to the N Bar. In Fergus County they have bought 79,000 acres. To the south in Musselshell County, they bought the Pronghorn Ranch from Holding's Sunlight Ranch Co., which added another 64,000 acres. In Golden Valley County, to the west of Musselshell County, 34,800 acres of property has been purchased by the Wilks. Most of the land deals in those three counties were located fairly close together, but the Wilkses have also purchased land farther away. In Meagher County, they bought 15,200 acres between the Big Belt and Little Belt mountain ranges near the popular Smith River and adjoining the Helena and Lewis and Clark national forests on two sides. Up north, they bought 22,800 acres near the Bears Paw Mountains in Blaine County. Southeast of Jordan, they bought 48,300 acres in Garfield County, and in Bighorn County east of Hardin they purchased 12,000 acres near the Bighorn River. All of the land deals have been recorded within the last two years. Dan Tiegen, whose 44,500-acre family ranch north of Grass Range is for sale for $21.6 million, said his family has talked to the Wilks brothers about their property. But the family had initially sought a conservation easement from the state that would have preserved public hunting access and prevented development of the ranch. That deal fell through recently as the state moved to purchase land along the Milk River. The ranch was founded by Dan Tiegen's great-grandparents in 1884. 'The family is officially wanting to start a new chapter,' Tiegen said. 'Beyond that, how that chapter comes about remains to be seen.' Tiegen said he has some fears about the acquisition of smaller family farms by a large conglomerate, 'especially when your lifestyle is based on so much history and tradition'. But Lowry, the Wilkses' neighbor at the N Bar, has no problem with the many land acquisitions by his new neighbors and sees the brothers as more friendly and open than the previous owner. 'I figured that was their business,' he said of the land buys and rumors of fracking plans. 'If they're buying up land, they can do what they want with it.'","Texans Farris, 60, and Dan Wilks, 56, made their money in oil .

A teenage girl found dead in a car . which burst into flames after the driver crashed following a . drug-fuelled Halloween party was killed before the fire broke out, an . inquest heard today.

Flames engulfed the smashed car with unconscious Ellie trapped inside, while a lorry driver managed to pull Coleman free. Ellie was unrecognisable when her body was retrieved from the blaze. However, an inquest into Ellie’s death concluded the teenager had died before the flames broke out. The . hearing in Norwich was told a post-mortem examination found Ellie had . died from multiple injuries from the impact of the crash.

Leaving: Vicky Featherstone, outgoing artistic director for the National Theatre of Scotland, said she has been 'bullied' for being English . The outgoing director of the National Theatre of Scotland has revealed she almost quit over anti-English ‘bullying’. Vicky Featherstone set up the company from scratch, producing plays that travelled the world, including Black Watch and Alan Cumming’s one-man Macbeth. But now, leaving the job after six years, she has spoken out about the antagonism she  experienced for being English. The Surrey-born NTS artistic director is one of those attacked by Scots author Alasdair Gray this week as being a ‘colonist’, taking one of the best jobs north of the Border before returning to England. However, she said this was not the first time critics had used her nationality against her when questioning her work and accusing her of ignoring traditional Scottish plays. She said: ‘It really upset me because, as with all kinds of bullying, you don’t have a voice – so the hardest thing for me was that if people had criticised the programme, I could have defended it, but when people are criticising the programme because I am English, that is indefensible.’ She added: ‘I had a period – not long, because I am very strong – of a few weeks where I thought, “I cannot do this job, I don’t know how to do it”, that I wasn’t the right person for it, and I questioned myself because I didn’t know how to make decisions any more.’ Twitter was abuzz yesterday with support for the mother of two, who launched the NTS in 2006. David Greig, whose play The Strange . Undoing of Prudencia Hart is one of the theatre’s  success stories, . said: ‘Alasdair Gray’s got it so wrong. What people give to Scottish . culture has nothing to do with birthplace or length of residency.’ Critical praise: National Theatre of Scotland has produced many acclaimed plays which have travelled the world, including Black Watch, pictured, about Scottish soldiers in Afghanistan . Mark Cousins, a film critic who set up a mobile cinema to tour Scotland with actress Tilda Swinton, said: ‘As a Northern Irish person who’s lived in  Scotland for 30 years, I’ve always felt so welcome here. Until, that is, Alasdair Gray’s recent remarks.’ Trainspotting author Irvine Welsh said: . ‘There’s obviously a point to be made but the rhetoric deployed and the . naming of individuals was just plain wrong.’ 'Anti-English bully': Scottish artist Alasdair Gray . Independence supporter Mr Gray, 77, has conceded his comments might be interpreted as ‘anti-English prejudice’ but added that ‘these colonists were invited here and employed by Scots without confidence in their own land and people’. He named Miss Featherstone, along with Chris Carrell, a former head of the Scottish Arts Council, and an unnamed director of arts funding agency Creative Scotland. Miss Featherstone, who is leaving to join the Royal Court Theatre in London, did not realise at first that her English background would cause her problems. ‘I’m sure it was a thing from the beginning but nobody ever communicated it to me,’ she said. ‘It became a thing, interestingly, because people didn’t like my programming. ‘And rather than articulating that, it was easier to say the reason my programming was wrong for Scotland was because I am English and therefore don’t understand how to programme for Scotland.’ Newspaper stories, letters and journal articles increasingly focused on her Englishness. But last year she created Staging the Nation, a series of events debating the traditional Scottish plays she had been accused of neglecting. She also met one of her fiercest critics, writer Paul Henderson Scott, and listened to his views. She decided the comments would not force her out of her job, adding: ‘I always felt it was from a small group of people and did not actually represent the relationships that we had created around the rest of Scotland.’ She will be replaced at NTS by Laurie Sansom, former head of Royal & Derngate in Northampton – and also English. He said: ‘Edinburgh is almost like a second home, as it is for most people who work in theatre, but yes, I will in some ways be coming to it with fresh eyes, which will have advantages and disadvantages.’","Outgoing director Vicky Featherstone fires parting shot at critics who 'paralysed' her .

The schools of Newtown will again ring with the sounds of students and teachers today in the wake of Friday's shooting rampage, but the doors at Sandy Hook Elementary will remain shut. Most schools in the area have stood empty since 20-year-old gunman Adam Lanza slaughtered 20 children and six teachers and school staff in one of America's worst school massacres. But classes for most students will resume as the Connecticut town struggles to return to normal. Though things will be far from 'normal.' Back to school: Newtown school district students, pictured, are taken to school as classes resume for most Friday's massacre . Among the regular sounds of a school day - teachers reading to children, the scratch of pencil on paper - students will hear new ones, including the murmur of grief counselors and the footsteps of police officers. Four days after Lanza strode into Sandy Hook Elementary school and gunned down a score of 6- and 7-year-olds, in addition to six faculty and staff, that school will stay shut. It is an active crime scene, with police coming and going past a line of 26 Christmas trees that visitors have decorated with ornaments, stuffed animals and balloons in the school colors of green and white as a memorial to the victims. The massacre - one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history - shocked Americans, prompting some lawmakers to call for tighter restrictions on guns and causing school administrators around the country to assess their safety protocols.

Newtown police plan to have officers at the six schools scheduled to reopen on Tuesday, trying to offer a sense of security to the students and faculty, many of whom spent the weekend in mourning. School buses toured the countryside, picking up students while nervous parents in SUVs and pickup trucks dropped their children at the school gates. Newtown Police Lieutenant George Sinko acknowledged it may be difficult to ease the worries of the roughly 4,700 returning students and their families. 'Obviously, there's going to be a lot of apprehension. We just had a horrific tragedy. We had babies sent to school that should be safe and they weren't,' Sinko said. 'You can't help but think ... if this could happen again.' Newtown High School Principal Charles Dumais, in an e-mail to parents, said schools in the district would open two hours later than usual, with counselors available to students and their families. 'This is a day to start healing,' Dumais said. While school officials have not yet decided when Sandy Hook students will resume their studies, the building that they will move into - the unused Chalk Hill School in the nearby town of Monroe - already showed signs of preparation.

The administration's plans to curb violence include but are not limited to gun-control measures, a spokesman said. Police have warned it could take months for them to finish their investigation into the attack, which started when Adam Lanza killed his mother, Nancy, at home, before driving to the school armed with a Bushmaster AR 15 rifle and two handguns.

Scientists studying data from the the Large Hadron Collider who this summer announced the possible discovery of the Higgs boson now say they may have found two previously uknown particles. The most recent release from the Atlas experiment at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (Cern) shows that their data contains two clear peaks indicating new particles. It seems they have found one Higgs boson with one mass, and then another with a statistically significant slightly higher mass. Scroll down for video . The double reading: The blue plot in this graphic provided by Cern shows the 123.5 GeV signal, while the red plot shows the 126.5 GeV signal, findings which have rocked physicists at the LHC . First proposed in 1964 the Higgs boson is the last missing piece of the Standard Model, a widely accepted theory that describes the basic building blocks of the universe. According to that model of our world, the Higgs particle must exist to bestow mass on other fundamental particles. However, until it was possible to build high-powered colliders like the LHC it has been impossible to detect. Researchers at Cern in July announced that they believed their experiments had finally revealed the Higgs. But as Scientific American explains, their findings were far from definite. The Higgs they found appeared to show that the Higgs seemed to be decaying into two photons more often than they had expected - hinting at a new, as yet unimagined physics. Last week scientists with the project's Atlas experiment finally admitted that the bizarre revelations from their data - that there appears to be not one Higg's boson signal, but two.. There seems to be one version of Higgs boson with a mass of 123.5 gigaelectron volts (the unit particle physicists prefer using to measure mass) and a second Higgs with a mass of 126.6 GeV. A graphical representation of particles smashing into each other in the Large Hadron Collider: It had been hoped the findings would finally prove the Standard Model of physics . The Higgs boson was proposed in 1964 - it is the last missing piece of the Standard Model, the theory that describes the basic building blocks of the universe. The other 11 particles predicted by the model have been found - the Higgs is the last jigsaw piece. If the particle was shown not to exist, it would have meant tearing up the Standard Model and going back to the drawing board. And if there are in fact more than one Higgs boson particles, as the latest results seem to show, it could lead to a new understanding of dark matter, the mysterious substance thought to make up a large portion of the mass of the universe. Scientific American reports how the Atlas team have spent the past month trying to find out whether they had made a mistake in their analysis. They have so far found none, raising the possibility that there may indeed be two Higgs bosons. The anomalous result could of course still have been caused be a statistical blip that is not repeated as further data is collected, but their are certain versions of the Standard Model that predict the existence of multiple Higgs particles. However these theories do not predict why one kind would decay into two Z particles, while the other decays into photons. Furthermore the similarity in mass of the two particles is something that even the variants of the Standard Model are not able to explain. For the moment, the scientists at Cern are not too concerned. Tommaso Dorigo, an experimental particle physicist on the projects CMS experiment says it is likely to turn out to be a blip. He blogs: 'This is normal business - if we had to get excited at every slight disagreement between our measurements and our expectations, we'd be sick with Priapism (sorry ladies for this gender-specific pun).'","Latest release from Cern indicates that scientists have found two particles contending for the title of Higgs boson .

Welcome: Councillor John Lines the new Lord Mayor of Birmingham at his £27,000 Mayor-making ceremony in May . A banquet to welcome a cash-strapped city's new Lord Mayor has cost the taxpayer a staggering £27,000. A total of 425 guests donned formal wear and enjoyed drinks and a three-course meal as Tory Councillor John Lines became Lord Mayor of Birmingham, West Midlands, earlier this year - all at the expense of the city's council. The authority, which faces crippling funding cuts, will now look at slashing costs for next year's event with front-line services said to be under threat. The huge bill looks particularly extravagant when compared to similar ceremonies in the UK's other major cities. Bristol council's annual celebration cost nothing this year, while Manchester's modest celebration - a lunch for 22 guests - cost just £440. Only two other cities managed to rack up a four-figure tab - but bashes in both Liverpool and Leeds were still relatively cheap when compared to Birmingham's. Birmingham City Council, which announced earlier this month that it faces a £110million budget shortfall - £40million higher than the £70million projected earlier this year, will now look at ways to reduce costs and the number of guests attending next year. A committee made up of former Lord Mayor's will look at the costs of this year's dinner and recommend ways in which the council can slash costs in future. Councillor Randal Brew, who was mayor in 2007, said: 'We are looking at what the cost of the mayor-making is and have broken the £27,000 down into a list of expenses. 'The banquet itself is £17,500 and we will be looking to significantly reduce that. We will also be looking to substantially reduce the number of people attending.' The cost of the celebration was revealed after the Labour-run council's leader Sir Albert Bore issued a warning that entire services could be cut as the authority desperately looks to cut costs. Costly: Taxpayers shelled out £27,000 for this lavish ceremony to welcome new Lord Mayor John Lines . The cost of the lavish ceremony 'reeks of hypocrisy according to Robert Oxley, campaign manager of the Taxpayers Alliance. He said: 'Council bosses and civic leaders cannot maintain the moral authority to make necessary spending cuts if they are hold lavish taxpayer funded banquets. 'It reeks of hypocrisy to talk of wiping out front line services when you still manage to find money to spend tens of thousands of pounds on a mayor making shindig. 'Preserving tradition is one thing, but this event should be funded by sponsorship rather than the bill being left to hard-pressed Birmingham families.' And union chiefs also hit out at spending such a large sum on the lavish banquet given the council's dire financial situation. Regional secretary of Unison, Ravi Subramanian, said: 'The expense cannot be justified while services are being cut and people are losing their jobs. Birmingham's lavish mayor making ceremony cost £27,000. How local authorities in other cities celebrated the event: . Bristol £0: Chapel service, Mayor pays for small event in council parlour . Leeds £10,000: Total of 220 guests, three-course banquet . Liverpool £15,000: Total of 200 guests, drinks, four-course dinner and entertainment . Manchester £440: Lunch for 22 people .

Birmingham City Council has reduced its bar bill in recent years - the ceremony had previously included a separate wine reception, entertainment from a string quartet and a bugler to someone guests to dinner. Since taking over as council leader last May, Sir Albert has also cancelled the £2,000 high tea at the monthly council meetings. Tory Councillor Brew pointed out that, although Liverpool spent £15,500, it had 200 guests for a four-course dinner with live entertainment, creating a higher price per head. The mayoral committee is looking closely at the authority's deal with its Civic Catering company under which it pays a commercial rate bill for food and room hire. Earlier this month, Birmingham City Council approved £110million cuts to its April budget, with 90 jobs said to be under threat. Almost £4.5million of funding will be cut from voluntary sector organisations which provide home start services and family support. £23million is to be cut overall from the Children, Young People and Families fund. The authority may even follow Dudley Council's lead in polling residents on a council tax increase of more than two per cent.","A lavish banquet was thrown for new Birmingham Lord Mayor John Lines .

For diners with a really wild side, there is now a way to put a beastly spin on mealtimes. A Dutch crockery designer has created a range of quirky, animal-themed, white ceramic tableware pieces, including a hippo that dispenses oil and a pair of elephant salt and pepper pots. Interior designer Emilie Kroner founded her company Piselli Projects in January, and White Animal Life is their first project. Two by two: The rhino and hippo pair who dispense oil and vinegar and cost 340 Euro (£277) for the pair . Kroner says: 'White Animal Life, aka WAL, was inspired by the 17th and 18th century animals that were used as decoration on tureens, but were also in existence because of their great conversational value. 'Piselli tries to reinvent the function of these objects. In this case the animals overrule function. For once function is inferior to it's decoration.' Based in Amsterdam, Kroner launched Piselli Projects after 12 years as an interior designer when she 'felt more and more the urge to create something she could really call her own'. She added: 'WAL and all future projects shall convey humor, beauty, happiness, conscious awareness and a bit of absurdism.' Pink drink: The ceramic flamingo carafe is sold by Piselli for £428 . White goods: The elephant pair dispense salt and pepper and cost 320 Euro (£261) as a pair . The pieces include two different leopard napkin holders (140 Euro, £114 each); two different salt or pepper-dispensing elephants (150/180 Euro, £122/147); a hippo oil-dispenser (170 Euro, £139); a rhino vinegar-dispenser (180 Euro, £147); a crocodile sweet dish (600 Euro, £490); and a flamingo carafe (525 Euro, £428).

Nearly half of all households in Britain are worried about their debts as the squeeze on family finances intensifies, the Bank of England warns today. A toxic combination of runaway inflation and low wage growth has left millions struggling to make ends meet in the run up to Christmas. The average household is now £22 a month worse off than they were a year ago, according to a study from the Bank, blowing a £264 hole in annual family budgets. Concern: Low wage growth and runaway inflation have left millions worried about their finances . Bank governor Sir Mervyn King has described it as the biggest squeeze on incomes since the 1920s. The Bank’s quarterly bulletin, published today, shows 11.25million households in Britain are now ‘very concerned’ or ‘somewhat concerned’ about their debts. Many have cut their spending, looked for extra work or even asked for financial help from relatives as the longest downturn for a century takes its toll. ‘Incomes have been broadly flat over the past year and rises in prices will have eroded the spending power of that income,’ the study finds. ‘Households on low incomes are more likely to have seen their income fall and a number of households remain uncertain about their future incomes.’ Household spending accounts for two-thirds of economic output in Britain and the pressure on family finances has held back the recovery. Tough times: The Bank's governor Sir Mervyn King has described the situation as the biggest squeeze on incomes since the 1920s . The Bank report says consumer spending fell 6 per cent in the 2008 and 2009 recession and ‘has been broadly flat since the end of 2009’. The typical disposable income – after tax, national insurance, housing costs, bills and loan repayments – fell from £699 a month in 2011 to £692 a month this year, according to the report. But after inflation is taken into account, the average household is now £22 a month worse off than it was 12 months ago. Real incomes, once inflation is taken into account, are now only  just above where they were at the end of 2007. Modest wage growth has been eroded by the soaring cost of living, driven in part by the rise in VAT and higher energy bills. The five-year hit has left many worried about their financial security. The Bank report finds that 12 per cent of people are ‘very concerned’ about high levels of debt and a further third of the population is ‘somewhat concerned’ – a total of 45 per cent of households or 11.25million. Around 5 per cent of households, or 1.25million, have fallen behind with at least some bills and a further 17 per cent or 4.25million say it is a ‘constant struggle’ to keep up. The report says 35 per cent of households in Britain, or 8.75million, have cut spending while 4.5 per cent or just over 1.1million have asked for financial help from relatives. The Government’s efforts to restore the health of the country’s finances has also taken a heavy toll, with 48 per cent complaining that they have been affected by austerity, down slightly from 52 per cent last year. The Bank's report says consumer spending fell six per cent in the 2008 and 2009 recession and has remained flat since .","Average household now £22 a month worse off than a year ago .

Just 12-hours after the X Factor results were announced to the world Jahmene was straight into a studio to record the iconic festive song ‘Silent Night’.

From the reasons why men cheat to why . it's a good idea to get married, video blogger Emily Hartridge's . laugh-out-loud videos have become an internet sensation. This time, it's all about boobs. 'Hello lesbians, perverts, anyone who appreciates the female upper body. This topic is just for you,' says Emily. While Emily modestly admits hers are 'not the best example' of breasts, she's still 'proud of them'. In Emily's video '10 Reasons Why Boobs Are Awesome', reason three is 'They're pretty fun for boys to play with' Her first reason for why breasts are so marvellous is that 'babies get free food from them'. To demonstrate, her 'assistant' Chris asks for milk from her breats for his coffee. Emily then apologies to the camera: 'Sorry, that was really disgusting.' Reason two is: 'bras are an amazing place to store things, so we don't need to carry a bag with us'. She illustrates this with a scene in which Chris asks for cab money - which Emily takes out from her . bra. He then asks for a bottle opener which she pulls . out from her cleavage. She continues producing items such as an umbrella and a cheese grater from her bra. In Emily's video '10 Reasons Why Boobs Are Awesome', reason two is 'Bras are a great place to store things' Emily sells Chris a blow up quiff (even though he already has one) to demonstrate reason eight: Boobs have phenomenal powers to control men . Reason five is: 'Boobs can really help in a job interview... but only if the person interviewing you is a man or a lesbian'. During a comical mock job interview Emily pushes her chest in Chris' face and pulls a sympathy face. Reason six is defined as: 'If you're having an ugly day you can detract the attention form your face'. Emily walks into a room with a stuffed bra and make-up smudged all over her face and Chris thinks she looks wonderful. With make-up smudged all over her face, Chris fails to notice due to the effects of reason six: 'If you're having an ugly day you can detract the attention form your face' 1.

If you're having an ugly day you can detract the attention form your face . 7. Only women get to have them . 8. Boobs have phenomenal powers to control men . 9. After a long hard day at work nothing is as comforting a resting place for our weary heads as the cushion of a bosom . 10. Boobs are pretty good for getting you laid . Another reason is: 'After a long hard day at work nothing is as comforting a resting place for our weary heads as the cushion of a bosom'. Chris relaxes on her chest, while Emily says: 'Dad, what are you doing?' She names reason ten as: 'Boobs are pretty good for getting you laid'. This is illustrated as she dances with Chris, knocks him out with a boob, then drags him up to her bedroom. The description of her video goes: 'Hi, I'm Emily, I take a wry look at the top 10 reasons why... a weekly show that proves that everything in the world can be explained with 10 reasons. You might not agree with everything I say and that's fine, my only intention is to provide you all with some much needed light entertainment.'

The former owner of Anne the elephant was yesterday found guilty of animal cruelty – but walked free from court without even being fined. Circus boss Bobby Roberts, 70, was given a conditional discharge for keeping Anne constantly chained in her winter quarters and failing to prevent a groom from beating her with a pitchfork. His wife Moira, 75, was cleared of the same charges after the judge ruled that she was not an owner of Anne and therefore not responsible for her care. The couple ran Bobby Roberts’ Super Circus where Anne’s ordeal was secretly filmed by animal rights group Animal Defenders International. Guilty: Bobby Roberts, pictured arriving at court today, has received a conditional discharge after being convicted of animal cruelty against Asian elephant Anne.  His wife Moira (right) has been cleared of all charges . Last night ADI chief executive Jan . Creamer said the ‘derisory’ sentence sent out the wrong message to other . animal owners and circuses. She said: ‘Despite the considerable . suffering caused to Anne the elephant, the sentencing meted out to Mr . Roberts is derisory and provides no faith that the Animal Welfare Act . can protect animals in circuses. ‘People should be held responsible for the day-to-day experiences of their animals.’ Roberts and his wife left Northampton magistrates court without commenting. Anne was brought over from Sri Lanka . in the 1950s and worked for the circus for 50 years. She was diagnosed . with arthritis, for which she was being treated, in 2003. Sick: The shocking pictures taken from secret footage filmed by Animal Defenders International show Anne being violently beaten around the head, legs and body with a pitchfork and other implements . Shocking: Anne was kicked repeatedly in the footage that was taken inside an elephant shed at Bobby Robert's winter quarters over a three and a half week period . Cruel: A keeper prepares to hit Anne once more with a stick . Suffering: The trial heard Anne rocked backwards and forwards which, as in humans, is a sign of distress . Roberts and his wife, of Oundle, . Northamptonshire, each denied three charges: Causing Anne unnecessary . suffering by requiring her to be chained to the ground by one front and . one back leg, failing to prevent a groom from beating her, and failing . to meet her needs by ensuring she had enough room to move around in. The beating was inflicted by groom . Nicolai Nitu, who is thought to have fled back to his native Romania and . has never been traced. At the end of the five-day trial . yesterday, District Judge David Chinery said he was satisfied Anne was . chained for an ‘excessive’ period and that caused her to suffer. Bobby . Roberts, who had health problems, entered the barn only four times . during the three-and-a-half week filming period. Each time Anne was chained but he . never asked for her to be untethered – and on one occasion supervised . the changing over of the chain from one leg to another. The judge said . Roberts witnessed Anne in chains but ‘for reasons which he cannot . explain’ did nothing about it. Usually Anne was unchained between . 11am and 7pm and allowed to wander around in an area of the barn . cordoned off by an electric fence in accordance with good practice . guidelines. Daily Mail, March 26, 2011 . The judge said Roberts failed to . exercise suitable supervision of the groom and it was clear the groom . was acting under instructions to keep Anne chained. But he told him: ‘The real cruelty was inflicted by your groom who acted without your knowledge.’ The maximum sentence for each charge . is a £20,000 fine and six months in jail. A ban on keeping animals could . also have been ordered but was not. The judge discharged Bobby Roberts on . condition he does not commit any further offence for three years, and . said he took into account that Roberts has ‘lost everything’ as a result . of the case and his business is now ‘effectively at an end’. Anne, aged 60 and Europe’s oldest . elephant, is now living at Longleat safari park in Wiltshire after the . Daily Mail intervened to find her a new home. Thanks to the incredible generosity of . our readers, who donated £340,000, she lives in the old elephant house and has access to a paddock and a pool.  Her keepers sometimes take her for walks around Longleat, when she is feeling up to it. Saved: Anne, pictured last year enjoying her first Christmas at Longleat, is thriving in her new home . Mail readers raised £400,000 to help Anne live the rest of her life in peace. The money was spent giving the elephant a new home at Longleat, where she moved in April last year. Funds are also being used to give her a custom-built sanctuary there which will feature a deep water facility, to help her arthritis, and a winter shelter. The new enclosure should be ready next year and it is hoped it will become a refuge for abused elephants. Meanwhile, she is still living a life of luxury in a paddock she shares with the rhinos. When she was first rescued, it was feared her arthritis was so bad she would have to be put down. But with proper care and attention, her legs improved. Longleat chief executive said Anne was 'getting younger by the day'.

Serbia's ambassador to NATO was chatting and joking with colleagues in a multistory parking garage at Brussels Airport when he suddenly strolled to a barrier, climbed over and flung himself to the ground below, a diplomat said. By the time his shocked colleagues reached him, Branislav Milinkovic was dead. His motives are a mystery. Three diplomats who knew Milinkovic said he did not appear distraught in the hours leading up to his death Tuesday night. He seemed to be going about his regular business, they said, picking up an arriving delegation of six Serbian officials who were due to hold talks with NATO, the alliance that went to war with his country just 13 years ago. Serbian ambassador Branislav Milinkovic strolled up to a barrier and flung himself to his death at a multistory garage at Brussels Airport . Mystery: Stunned colleagues could give no explanation for Mr Milinkovic's actions at Brussels Airport, pictured . A former author and activist opposed to the authoritarian regime of Serbia's former strongman Slobodan Milosevic, Milinkovic was outgoing, had a warm sense of humor and worked to keep good ties with ambassadors from other ex-Yugoslav countries, according to diplomats and acquaintances. The diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release details, said they knew of no circumstances - private or professional - that would have prompted him to take his own life. But Milinkovic, 52, had mentioned to colleagues at diplomatic functions that he was unhappy about living apart from his wife, a Serbian diplomat based in Vienna, and their 17-year-old son. One of the diplomats described his death to The Associated Press, saying she had spoken to a member of the delegation who had witnessed the leap from the 8- to 10-meter-high (26- to 33-foot-high) platform. The diplomats all spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not permitted by foreign service regulations to speak publicly to the press. Speaking in Brussels, Serbia's Prime . Minister Ivica Dacic said that 'Belgian police are investigating, but . it's obviously a suicide. It's hard to figure out the motives or . causes.' Milinkovic is believed to have been unhappy about living apart from his Vienna-based wife and their 17-year-old son . The death cast a pall on the second day of a meeting of NATO foreign ministers. Officials said they were shocked by the news of the death of a very popular and well-liked man. NATO's Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said he was 'deeply saddened by the tragic death of the Serbian ambassador.' 'As Serbian ambassador to NATO he earned the respect and admiration of his fellow ambassadors,' he said. When Yugoslavia was a united country, Milinkovic worked for a prominent Yugoslav foreign policy think-tank. But when Milosevic seized power in Serbia in late 1980s, Milinkovic joined other liberals who opposed the former strongman's regime and presented a rare voice of moderation during the era when much of Serbia was engulfed in nationalist fervor. He established close ties with international human rights and other groups and remained active in anti-war groups. Highly regarded as a liberal activist, Branislav Milinkovic, far left, had opposed the authoritarian regime of former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic . After Milosevic was ousted in 2000, Milinkovic was appointed Serbia's ambassador to the Organization for Security and Co-Operation in Europe, or OSCE, in Vienna. He was transferred to NATO as Serbia's special representative in 2004. Serbia is not a member of the military alliance, but Milinkovic was named ambassador after Belgrade joined NATO's Partnership for Peace program, which involves neutral states. The move to join the NATO program had angered Serbian nationalists who are now in power. They have pledged that Serbia will never join NATO because of the alliance's 1999 bombing campaign that forced Milosevic's forces to withdraw from Serbia's southern province of Kosovo. In 2008, Kosovo declared independence from Serbia, which has never accepted that loss. Milosevic was widely blamed for instigating the '90s Balkan wars that followed the breakup of Yugoslavia, conflicts that claimed more than 100,000 lives and left millions homeless. At NATO, Milinkovic worked to foster closer ties with the representatives of all five other nations that gained independence after the bloody 1991 breakup of the former Yugoslav federation into Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Slovenia and Serbia. Relations were still politically charged when Milinkovic first arrived in Brussels, but they have since improved drastically. Two months ago, when Croatia's ambassador to NATO was being transferred to Moscow, Milinkovic organized a dinner for all five of his counterparts and a band played music from all parts of the former Yugoslav federation. He is survived by his wife and son.","Serbian ambassador Branislav Milinkovic strolled up to a barrier and flung himself to his death at a multistory garage at Brussels Airport .

Starving: The severely emaciated dog, named Hero by the hotel staff who found him, weighed less than half the normal weight of an adult male Rottweiler . RSPCA inspectors have released the shocking footage captured close to the Crown Hotel in Littlehampton last Wednesday night. The clip shows the two women approaching a gated area outside the hotel shortly after 8pm. One of the women appears to spot the CCTV camera and begins to back away, but after a short conversation with her accomplice leads the dog towards the gated area and begins to tie the lead to the metal fencing while the second woman looks on. Eventually, her accomplice, thought by RSPCA inspectors to be heavily pregnant, comes to help her friend tie the dog up. The pair look at the camera again and seem to weigh up the risks of being caught abandoning the dog before they hastily retreat, closing a gate behind them. An RSPCA inspector described the animal, later named Hero when he was found by pub staff, as 'one of the thinnest' dogs he had seen as the charity appealed for help in finding the pair.

'It was very frightening': Hannah White (pictured) nearly died from a flesh-eating bug after being bitten by a spider in her local park . A jogger almost died after being bitten by a spider and infected with a deadly bug. Hannah White, 29, was doing press-ups in her local park when the spider bit her right thigh. Within days, her leg had swollen to twice its normal size. The condition was caused by a rare flesh-eating bug, which entered her body via the spider bite wound. Doctors told Miss White she would die unless they removed part of her thigh, which could have left her disabled for life. But, miraculously, she managed to fight off the infection naturally. Her case follows that of Natalie Hemme, who almost lost an arm when she was bitten by a household spider. Recovering in hospital yesterday, Miss White, a broadcaster who worked on the sailing events at this summer’s Olympics, said she was lucky to be alive. She assumed the bite was from a mosquito when it appeared after she exercised in Regent’s Park, London, eight days ago. But by the following day, it began to swell, with the redness spreading down her leg. She went to her local NHS drop-in centre, which prescribed antibiotics, but when the swelling became unbearable her parents took her to A&E. Doctors at St Thomas’ Hospital in London were baffled, originally diagnosing an abscess. They monitored the swelling every two hours and gave antibiotics intravenously. But by Monday morning, they realised she had all the symptoms of necrotising fasciitis, an infection that eats away at human flesh. ‘It was very frightening,’ said Miss White, who spent seven years competing as a professional sailor. ‘One minute it was just a bite and then the next minute I’m in A&E. It looked as if it would have been surgery or death. ‘They told me, “You can’t kill it with drugs, the only way to get rid of it is to cut it out”.’ Life-threatening: Hannah's wound 24 hours (left) and 36 hours (right) after the bite in Regent's Park . Miraculous recovery: Doctors said Hannah (left, 48 hours after the bite) would die unless they removed part of her leg, but as seen here (right) the infection recovered naturally . But before doctors could operate, the swelling began to subside. By yesterday, the infection was all but cleared up and Miss White was preparing to go home. ‘I’m a medical marvel. The doctors couldn’t believe it,’ she said. Doctors said she must have an extremely strong immune system, as the bug kills up to a quarter of those infected. ‘They said that because I’m fit and strong my body must have stopped the bacteria getting absolute hold of me,’ Miss White said. ‘My body has been fighting it all week – I’m exhausted. ‘It’s absolutely amazing that all this happened just because of a spider bite. I’ve travelled the world doing potentially dangerous things and I’ve been fine. I can’t believe that this has happened to me here at home in London.’ On Thursday, civil servant Mrs Hemme, 31, from South-West London, told the Daily Mail how she developed compartment syndrome, causing the flesh on her arm to die, after she was bitten as she slept.","Hannah White, 29, was bitten while doing press-ups in London park .

The cruise ship crooner turned politician made the revelation during a long and wide-ranging interview on one of his numerous TV stations - and it came despite the fact he is still officially tied to his second wife Veronica Lario. Berlusconi, who is currently on trial accused of having sex with an underage prostitute, said: 'It’s official, I have got engaged to Francesca Pascale and finally I feel less lonely. 'There is a 49 year age difference between us. She is a beautiful girl on the outside and even more beautiful on the inside, of solid moral principles, she is very close to me, she loves me and I feel the same way. 'She is a very good friend of my daughter Marina.' In recent weeks the two have been seen together at the San Siro stadium in Milan watching his AC Milan football team and they were also snapped laughing and joking at a pizzeria in the city centre. The two have been linked before and she has been seen driving into his apartment in Rome. She is a former councillor in Naples with his People of Freedom Party. Miss Pascale has strongly defended Berlusconi in the past and cooed how she loved his ideas in interviews and is also famous for singing a song which includes the eye opening line of: 'If you pull your knickers down the ratings go up.' Berlusconi also spoke of his ongoing trial which is centred on his infamous bunga bunga parties and again insisted nothing untoward took place at the evenings in his villa at Arcore near Milan. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Glamorous: Francesca Pascale has been in a relationship with former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi for last few months . He said: 'There was nothing illegal going on, they were just elegant dinners. It was a particular moment for me, I had just announced my divorce, my mother and my sister had just died. 'I would go home and there was no-one there, I felt sad.' Berlusconi is alleged to have paid Moroccan belly dancer Karima El Mahroug for sex when she attended the parties as a 17-year-old girl and dozens of other TV starlets were also said to have been given cash, jewellery and cars for turning up. The age of consent in Italy is 14 but paying a woman under the age of 18 is seen as prostitution with a minor and is punishable by up to three years in jail. Silvio Berlusconi supported Francesca Pascale as she ran for office in Naples in 2009 . But Berlusconi hit back at judges and prosecutors in Milan where the case is being heard, once again insisting they were politically led and out to get him. He said: 'I have fallen into their trap, it’s been built up by the judiciary. The trial is just an incredible machination. 'It was an excuse they needed to hit me with a massive defamation operation against me and my government which had international implications.' He added: 'In a twenty year political career you get used to all sorts of insults. But there is something that before God smells of a vendetta. 'I have been convicted to four years in jail by a court in Milan who accused me of being behind a system that saved me three million euros a year but at the same time I paid 570million euros in taxes.' In a 120-minute interview on his Canale 5 station with host Barbara D’Urso, Berlusconi also explained why he was running for prime minister a year after being forced out of office. He said: 'We are in the same situation as 1994 - if I don’t run then the Left will get in. We cannot run the risk of them winning.' Despite his boasts commentators see a win for Berlusconi as unlikely given that his party is trailing third in the polls with around 20% of the vote, with Democratic Left leader Pier Luigi Bersani the favourite to win. Berlusconi’s appearance on the show unleashed a storm of protest on the internet, with many expressing anger at what they described as an 'obvious and concrete example of a conflict of interest.'","Scandal-hit Berlusconi anounced engagement in interview on one of his TV channels .

An egg donor has told how after helping two other couples conceive, she may never get pregnant. Leah Campbell, 29, from Anchorage, Alaska, started experiencing problems seven months after her second donation and doctors diagnosed her with Stage IV endometriosis, a disease - often referred to as the Silent Invader - that affects the uterus. Desperate to have children of her own, she racked up $30,000 worth of debt going through two rounds of IVF, but both cycles failed and now she says 'I don’t know what the future holds'. Heartbreaking: Egg donor Leah Campbell helped others to conceive, but now she is battling infertility issues . She told The Huffington Post: 'When I was in the middle of it I would have done anything, I would have gone to the end of the world to get pregnant. It was all that mattered to me. 'Realistically the only thing that . stopped me was that I was $30,000 in debt, and heartbroken, and on my . own, and I couldn't do it anymore.' Campbell first decided to become an egg donor after hearing about a friend who had done it. She explained: 'I just thought it was such a cool thing that she had done.' Devastating: Campbell went through two rounds of IVF but both cycles failed . In July 2008 and January 2009 she donated her eggs to two different families. She learned that the first family got pregnant with twins on the first try, however the second family never conceived. Endometriosis is a gynecological medical condition that affects women in their reproductive years. The cause is unknown. The exact prevalence of the condition is not known, since many have no symptoms. Common signs are pelvic pain during menstruation and infertility. Estimates suggest that between 20per cent to 50per cent of women being treated for infertility have endometriosis, and up to 80per cent of those with chronic pelvic pain may be affected. While most cases of are diagnosed in women aged around 25-35 years, it has been reported in girls as young as 11 years of age. It can be treated with medications or surgery. The goals of treatment may include pain relief or enhancement of fertility. SOURCE: www.medicinenet.com . 'The strange thing that happened was I felt so connected to these families,' she recalled. Initial check-ups suggested she was healthy and in 'perfect reproduction state'. But months down the line she found herself in hospital repeatedly for surgeries. Doctors warned her that her window for getting pregnant was closing and it was a now or never scenario. She said: 'I felt so lost. I was single at the time, I had been dating but there wasn't anyone in my life that I saw my forever with. 'I knew I'd always wanted to be a mom, . but doing it on my own had never been the plan. 'All my . friends were married and they were having kids, and I felt that none of . them could relate to what i was going through.' She said that experiencing repeated IVF as a single woman was 'probably the most devastating thing I’ve ever gone through'. Now she is offering advice to other infertile women and endometriosis sufferers through a blog site and Facebook page titled the Single Infertile Female. She says that as she nears 30, she is slowly warming to the idea of adoption. In the past she said knew it was an option but it was always 'secondary to the real dream. It was runner up to my true desire of carrying my 'own' children.'","Leah Campbell was diagnosed her with Stage IV endometriosis .

Now, as the 76-year-old seeks re-election as Italian Prime Minister, he has a new lady by his side. At 27, the stunning Francesca Pascale, a member of his party, is nearly a third his age. The relationship, which has been going . steadily for months, was confirmed by Daniela Santanche, an MP in his . Freedom of the People party, who described it as a 'beautiful thing'. It was also announced by the Italian press which have described Miss Pascale as Italy's new 'first lady'. Going steady: Francesca Pascale (pictured) has been in a relationship with former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi for last few months . Licia Ronzulli, a Euro MP in his party, told the Daily Telegraph: 'Let's say she is a person who is very close to him. She's more than a friend.' Miss Pascale, a former shop assistant . from Naples, served as a provincial councillor in his centre-Right PDL . party before stepping down in July. A founding member of a support group . called 'Silvio, we miss you', she has previously said the three most . important things in her life are her family, politics and Mr Berlusconi. It is said she is jealous of the other women in his inner circle, including Mara Carfagna, a glamour model whom he appointed equal opportunities minister during his last term as Prime Minister. Berlusconi has been married twice and has five children. In 1965, he married Carla Elvira Dall'Oglio, and they had two children. Vying for power: The emergence of the relationship comes as Silvio Berlusconi (pictured) confirmed he will run for leadership again in next year's election . He later had three more children with his second wife, the actress Veronica Lario, from whom he is separated. Over the years, Mr Berlusconi has been linked with a string of glamorous young women, including models, actors, showgirls and prostitutes who attended his notorious 'bunga bunga' sex parties at his mansions. In July, the former Prime Minister was forced to deny allegations by a model who claimed that she was pregnant with his sixth child. Sabina Began - who earned her nickname 'Queen Bee' for her alleged lead role in the infamous Buna Bunga parties - claimed she was expecting the controversial politician's baby but has since lost it. The 38-year-old German model and actress told Italian newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano i she was sure it was his child as she had 'only slept with him'. Trials and accusations: Mr Berlusconi, now 76, . is accused in another trial of paying to have sex with Karima El-Mahroug . in 2010 when she was 17 . She later sent writers for the Italian gossip website Dagospia a text message informing them she had lost the baby overnight due to a miscarriage. The news prompted Berlusconi’s lawyer, Niccolo Ghedini, to issue a denial. He currently faces trial over allegations he paid Moroccan exotic dancer Karima el-Mahroug for sex when she was 17, a year under the legal age for prostitution. Meanwhile, it has emerged that Miss el-Mahroug has turned up in Mexico after missing a court date and becoming entangled in Italy's latest political drama. News agency ANSA reported that Miss el-Mahroug, known as Ruby, notified her attorney of her whereabouts after reading that her absence on Monday had sparked a minor uproar in court. Forced into denial: German model Sabina Began pictured at the Vertu Global Launch Of The 'Constellation' at Palazzo Serbelloni claimed in July that she was expecting Berlusconi's child . Attorney Paola Boccardi informed the court on Tuesday that Ruby wasn't expected back until next month, ANSA said. Berlusconi is accused of paying Ruby, then 17, for sex during his bunga bunga parties, and using his office to cover it up. Both deny the accusations. A verdict in the case had been expected as early as January. Mr Berlusconi has confirmed that he will stand in next year’s election, a year after being forced to resign amid a sex scandal and a debt crisis. A conviction right before the election would be a major blow to Berlusconi, who in October was convicted of tax fraud in a separate case involving his media holdings. He denied the charges and is appealing the sentence, which isn't considered definitive until all three levels of appeal are exhausted. The courtroom turmoil played out as Italy's political and financial foundations were rocked by fallout from Berlusconi's decision last week to yank his party's support for Premier Mario Monti's government, accusing Monti's austerity measures of making Italy worse off than a year ago when he was last in power. Monti announced over the weekend that he would resign after Parliament passes the 2013 budget, forcing elections to be moved up several weeks to February. Monti was tapped last year to replace Berlusconi, who was forced to resign after international markets lost faith in his ability to save Italy from a Greek-style debt crisis.","Francesca Pascale in steady relationship with former Italian PM, 76 .

"By . Sam Greenhill . PUBLISHED: . 12:17 EST, 4 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:55 EST, 5 December 2012 . A senior MP broke down in tears yesterday as she condemned the ‘coldness, indifference and contempt’ of nurses she blames for her husband’s death. Ann Clwyd said her beloved Owen Roberts died ‘like a battery hen’ after her repeated pleas for NHS nurses to help him were ‘brushed aside’. Miss Clwyd, a Labour MP for 28 years, sobbed as she revealed she has nightmares over the way Mr Roberts died six weeks ago ‘from the cold and from people who didn’t care’. At one stage, she said, her 6ft 2in . husband was ‘squashed up against the iron bars of the bed’ and nurses . cried ‘anybody for breakfast’ at the very moment that he passed away. Speaking out: MP Ann Clwyd (left) said she found her husband Owen Roberts (right) squashed up in a hospital bed with an oxygen mask that didn't fit . Her excoriating verdict on the NHS came as the chief nursing officer for England called for more compassion in hospitals. Jane Cummings said such values should be ‘embedded’ in public health care. Miss Clwyd’s husband, a former head of news and current affairs at BBC Wales and an ITV executive, had multiple sclerosis and died, aged 73, on October 23 this year at University Hospital of Wales, in Cardiff. She said he had hospital-induced pneumonia and nurses did not keep him warm or care for him. The day before he died, she visited him from 2.30pm to 10.30pm, and wrote in a text message to a friend at 10.59pm: ‘No doctor has been to see him since this morning. Very few nurses around either. Not very happy with the set up.’ At 5am the next day she was called in and found her husband wearing an oxygen mask. In an emotional interview on Radio 4’s The World at One, Miss Clwyd said: ‘He didn’t have any clothes over him, he was half-covered by two, very thin, inadequate sheets, his feet were sticking out of the bed at an angle, and he was extremely cold. I tried to cover him with a towel. ‘He was very distressed and totally aware of his situation and, although unable to speak because of the oxygen mask, he made it clear he was cold and wanted to come home. Well, a few hours later, he died.’ The University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff. A spokesman for the hospital said: 'We will not tolerate poor care' The 75-year-old MP for Cynon Valley claimed she had seen a nurses’ round only ‘once’ during her entire eight-hour visit the day before his death. She said: ‘I kept asking people. I would go into the corridor and there were just no nurses around. I stopped one nurse in the corridor and asked her why he wasn’t in intensive care.  She said, “There are lots of people worse than him”, and she walked on. I previously stopped another nurse and asked when a doctor had last seen him, and I was just brushed aside, and told a doctor had been to the floor but had not seen my husband, but she said, “We know what to do.” ‘Well I feel that “we know what to do” meant “do nothing”.’ Speaking on DayBreak this morning, the MP said she was aware of the challenges that overstretched NHS staff faced. However, she said that didn't excuse basic failures of care. 'You shouldn't go into nursing unless you have some feeling and compassion for the people you are supposed to be looking after,' she told presenter Lorraine Kelly. 'I didn't feel like anyone was listening, that anyone was taking notice of what I was saying,' she said. 'There should be dignity in death and humanity and I just didn't see it.' When speaking on Radio 4 the veteran politician, a former chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, recalled her campaigning for legislation on the welfare of battery hens, and said: ‘My husband died like a battery hen.’ Serving the country: Ann Clwyd, was the UK special envoy for Human Rights in Iraq from 2003 to 2010. She is pictured with a soldier during a 2005 visit to the Welsh Guards in Iraq . Describing the conditions in which . her husband of 49 years – they had no children – spent his final hours, . she said: ‘He is 6ft 2in, he was squashed up against the iron bars of . the bed, an oxygen mask that didn’t fit his face, his eye was infected . and, because the air from the oxygen was blowing into it, his lips were . very dry and I used my own Lypsyl to try to moisten them. There were no . nurses around. ‘At eight o’clock, just before he died, all the lights in the ward went on and somebody shouted “Anybody for breakfast?” ‘It . was obviously totally inappropriate when they knew there was somebody . dying in that four-bed ward. The man next to him had been feeling hot . and had a fan on and it was blowing the cold air towards my husband. I . really do feel he died of cold and he died from people who didn’t care.’ She made clear she . did not include all the nurses, but lamented what she described as the . ‘coldness, resentment, indifference and even contempt’ of some of them. Despite . her experience in the corridors of power, she said she felt helpless at . her inability to save her husband. ‘It gives me nightmares,’ she said, . and began to cry as she added: ‘I find it very difficult to sleep... and . very difficult to talk about.’ Miss Clwyd said she was speaking out so that other people should not have to suffer in the same way. ‘I think it’s just too commonplace this kind of thing,’ she said. ‘I kept thinking about him being cold, but then I thought he was with professionals. That’s so basic. I can’t believe anybody calling themselves a nurse could actually let that happen. Nobody, nobody should have to die in conditions like I saw my husband die in.’ A Left-winger, Miss Clwyd is a well-known advocate of human rights for beleaguered minorities such as the Kurds. Last night the hospital’s executive director of nursing, Ruth Walker, said staff had offered to meet Miss Clwyd so that a formal investigation could begin. ‘We take such matters extremely seriously,’ she said. ‘We will not tolerate poor care which is why it is so important that each incident is fully investigated so that we can drive up standards and provide patients and their families with the quality of care they need and deserve.’","MP said her husband was 'squashed up against the iron bars of the bed' with 'an oxygen mask that didn’t fit his face'

Stocking up: A Sainsbury's employee walks through the 700,000 sq ft distribution depot in Waltham Abbey, Essex, on Friday, as the supermarket gears up for Christmas . A British Retail Consortium spokesman told MailOnline today: ‘Judging from the week commencing 3rd December, footfall is building. ‘But we called it a baby step rather than a big leap. It's positive that footfall is building, but it's not in a big way as yet.' Footfall went up 2.3 per cent week-on-week, but down 1.7 per cent . year-on-year, . She added: ‘Lots of shoppers are holding back on their spending in the hope of better discounts. But we're expecting it to follow last year's pattern. Things didn't look so good to start with, but the weekends just before Christmas redressed the balance.’ Meanwhile big discounts offered by retailers this weekend were tempting people out in huge numbers to high streets and shopping centres. The festive season brought a welcome boost for retailers on the penultimate Saturday before the big day, as shoppers were out in force in London. Jace Tyrrell, of the New West End Company, which represents 600 firms, said it had been busy at stores such as Topshop, Hamleys and House of Fraser. She added: ‘There are discounts on selected items of up to 50 per cent, including 40 per cent at House of Fraser, and 30 per cent at Debenhams.

The firm's website, johnlewis.com, also hit a new high of £43.1million for the week. John Lewis said gift buying was fuelling the boom - including food, fashion, toys and technology, but the focus is shifting towards presents for women as sales of handbags, jewellery and beauty products are soaring. Maggie Porteous, head of selling operations for John Lewis, said: 'With a further nine shopping days before the big event, it is excellent news to have already had two record weeks, both over £140million for the first time.' ‘We've had a strong performance in the West End recently. November footfall was up more than five per cent on the previous November. ‘In a way we are in a bit of a bubble here, with the tourists coming here, so there is a different feel in central London from the rest of the UK.’ Shoppers  in the capital's leading shopping hub Oxford Street would have been forgiven for thinking the New Year had come early with the number of stores offering discounts. Bargain-seekers usually have to wait until after Christmas for businesses to start slashing prices. But those who left buying their presents until today and braved the heaving crowds were rewarded. Shoppers flocked to outlets such as Primark and US clothing chain Gap, which cut prices by half on selected items. Braehead shopping centre, in Glasgow, was in ‘full swing’, according to its general manager, Peter Beagley. Selected shops will be open until midnight from Monday to Christmas Eve to try to catch as many shoppers as possible. Mr Beagley said: ‘Christmas shopping is now well and truly in full swing.

Richard Tarbutt, assistant manager of the outlet's store in Cardiff, said new versions of old favourites were proving particularly popular. Shop till you drop: Festive shoppers were looking for a last minute Christmas bargain today at Primark in London's Oxford Street .

Price is right: The sales have been stealing the show when it comes to attracting people to London's world famous West End today . ‘I'm expecting it to be very busy but . we are up against some tough like-for-like figures from last year as . this day last year was essentially the last Saturday before Christmas, . but we've got another Saturday this year.

Mum-of-one Natasha Henshaw, a care worker, said: 'I went in to get beautiful and I came out looking like a beast' Natasha was told that all of the soft tissue around her eyebrows had been burned and the dye should never have been applied to open pores . She went home assuming the pain would subside – but woke the next day to find her eyebrows  had ‘fallen out’. Doctors have warned it is unlikely they will grow back. Miss Henshaw said: ‘I went in to get beautiful and I came out looking like a beast, it’s horrible. ‘My doctor told me I could have gone blind had [the tint] been left on for much longer. ‘I have been in agony with them, they are so itchy, I just want to scratch them off. I have been in a lot of pain.’ Natasha Henshaw, 25, thought she would be fine after she went into her local salon for a routine appointment to have her eyebrows tinted and waxed . Miss Henshaw had the £10 tint and wax two . weeks ago at the Boudoir salon near her home in Dingle, Liverpool. The . beautician waxed her eyebrows before applying a tint, but did not . perform a patch test beforehand to check for an allergic reaction. Natasha, pictured before the treatment. The ordeal has now left her unable to leave her house . When Miss Henshaw woke the next day, she found her eyebrows ‘scattered all over’ her face and went to an NHS walk-in centre. She was diagnosed with an allergic reaction and given antihistamines. But two days later, the condition got so bad she could barely open her eyes and she went to see her doctor – who said she was lucky not to have lost her sight. Miss Henshaw was told that the soft tissue around her eyebrows had been burned and the dye should never have been applied to open pores. She was prescribed antibiotics, but the ordeal has left her nervous about leaving the house. Miss Henshaw, who has a two-year-old son called Logan, said: ‘The fact I have no eyebrows has totally knocked my confidence, I don’t want to go out.’ Boudoir claims that Miss Henshaw, who had visited the salon before, had asked for the tint to be applied after the wax – a claim that she denies. Salon owner Dean Foster said the beautician who treated Miss Henshaw had walked out on her job after the incident. He added: ‘Clearly Natasha has had a reaction to the treatment and then picked up an infection. ‘We did not give her a patch test as she has had the treatment before. We will do anything we can to help her.’ Boudoir claims that Natasha, who has visited the salon without incident before, had asked for the tint to be applied after the wax — a claim that she denies .","Natasha Henshaw, 25, left in agony after waxing session .

Princess Diana's former butler Paul Burrell wrote of his disgust that anyone could reveal the Royal family's 'most personal secrets' 20 years before he did the same himself. Letters he wrote to a friend when he served as the Queen's footman in 1982 show his reaction to the publishing of the memoirs of Prince Charles' former valet Stephen Barry. Burrell, who has since published a tell-all book about his time at Buckingham Palace, wrote: 'I think it is disgusting - someone revealing the most personal secrets of the Royal Family. Her rock: Diana's former butler Paul Burrell who went on to sell a tell-all book on the royals in 2003 . 'They must be cautious when chatting to staff from now on - after all, they must wonder 'who can one trust?'.' Burrell has been accused of cashing-in on his time in the Royal Household and betraying the confidence of Princess Diana since publishing his memoirs in 2003. His book, A Royal Duty, was said to have been highly damaging and included allegations of an affair between Prince Charles and nanny Tiggy Legge-Bourke. Burrell spent 10 years as the Queen's footman at Buckingham Palace before working as Diana's butler for another 10 years up until her death in 1997. Paul Burrell (left) justified revealing Princess Diana's secrets, but years earlier criticised such an act . His 30 letters, that are now to be sold at auction, also include sweet anecdotes of the Queen playing the role of a doting grandmother to Zara Phillips when she was a baby. As a 15-month-old, Zara wore her best party dresses when having breakfast and afternoon tea with the Queen during a stay at Balmoral Castle in August 1982. The Queen was said to have been 'thrilled' with her granddaughter and made a point of saying goodnight to her at 6.30pm. The letters also tell how Zara's elder brother Peter, then aged four, wheeled her around the Scottish castle in a toy car. When Burrell said to their mum that Zara looked quite happy, Princess Anne quipped: ""Well at least she is now, until he tips over."" On another occasion at Balmoral, the Queen raised concerns about the health of one of her corgi dogs. Causing a stir: Paul Burrell upset many in the Royal Family's inner circle with his memoirs in 2003 . Her late sister Margaret puffed on a cigarette and replied: 'Well, perhaps he'll pop orf in the night!' All the letters, dated from June to December 1982, were sent to Burrell's friend Michael Hillard. They were found in a routine clearance of Mr Hillard's home in Bournemouth, Dorset, following his recent death and are now being sold. They are expected to sell for a total of about £500. Richard Davie, of International Autograph Auctions which is holding the auction, said: 'There are some interesting comments in these letters from Paul Burrell. Pen pal: Letters written by Paul Burrell to a friend during his time in the Royal household . 'His views on giving away Royal Family secrets certainly raise an eyebrow when you look at what he did years later in publishing a couple of books about his involvement with Princess Diana and the Royal Family. 'But other parts of these letters do give a fascinating insight into the hum-drum life in the Royal Household.' Burrell, now aged 52, also wrote of how the Royal Family enjoyed barbecues at Balmoral - even when it was cold and wet. He wrote: 'Margot screeched at the suggestion and Diana groaned, Sarah pulled a face but everyone seemed quite happy. '""Wish I was tucked up in bed with our one and only"" Diana said before leaving.' The auction takes place tomorrow at the Radisson Edwardian Hotel at Heathrow, west London.

Newly crowned BBC Sports Personality of the Year Bradley Wiggins is to be offered a knighthood - but there are huge doubts about whether he will accept it. It has been recommended the Tour de France winner and Olympic gold medallist be placed on the Queen's New Year's Honours list. Wiggins and three other stars - sailor Ben Ainslie, Paralympic cyclist Sarah Storey and Paralympic track star David Weir - will be asked to become Sir or Dame on January 1, it has emerged. Icon: Bradley Wiggins was crowned BBC Sports Personality of the Year on Sunday and is set to be offered a knighthood - but will he take it? Great moment: The Duchess of Cambridge hands over the famous trophy to 'Wiggo' as smiling David Beckham and Jess Ennis watch on . Popular: 'Wiggo' has become a British hero and won Sports Personality in a landslide win backed by 500,000 votes from the public . But 32-year-old Londoner 'Wiggo' has hinted he may shun the honour as he is uncomfortable with 'hierarchy and status'. This would fly in the face of huge online campaigns and support from the Prime Minister - all desperate for him to become Sir Bradley after his sparkling year. He won sports personality in a landslide victory backed by almost 500,000 public votes lodged in just 35 minutes on Sunday. After the victory he was asked if it was the perfect end to his year and he replied: 'Yeah, it is. There’s only the knighthood to come, isn’t there, really?'. Letting his hair down: Bradley clings to a male pal outside Whisky Mist looking slightly worse for wear after a few drinks on Sunday night . Fun: Bradley and his wife Catherine both enjoyed his victory at the ExCel on Sunday . The day job: Wiggins is now one of Britain's most famous men because of his sporting excellence, winning the Tor de France this year and collecting gold at London 2012 - one of seven Olympic medals in his career . Big win: Britain went wild when Bradley won the Men's Individual Time Trial on day five of the London Olympic Games . But the badboy of British sport, sometimes seen swearing at photographers, stumbling out of nightclubs drunk or having a cheeky cigarette, may turn it down. In his autobiography My Time he wrote: 'During the Games, there was speculation about whether I might end up with a knighthood in the same way Sir Chris Hoy did after his great year. 'People asked me about it, so I did wonder whether I would accept it if it were to come my way. 'I can never see myself being given a title like Sir Bradley Wiggins. I have never considered myself above anybody else. I have always struggled with hierarchy and status. Romp: Wiggins won gold medal by a huge margin and showed his superiority as the world's top cyclist . Cool customer: Bradley Wiggins sits on the throne as he celebrates winning gold and is known to be uncomfortable in the spotlight . 'I don’t know what it is – maybe just my upbringing, the area I’m from – but I’m quite happy to play second fiddle. 'I understand my physical capabilities sometimes give me status but, when it’s all done and dusted, I struggle with that kind of thing. 'It’s not what happens to kids from Kilburn.' Well known: The Team Sky rider is also well known for his love of music and particularly the Modfather Paul Weller - Bradley shown here playing guitar at the sports personality after party . Seven time Olympic medallist Bradley Wiggins has a CBE from 2009, Ben Ainslie, who has medals from five consecutive Olympics, including four golds in a row also has a CBE. British sports icon Bradley Wiggins said today that winning BBC Sports Personality Of The Year topped off a perfect 2012. He won with 500,000 votes - more than the number of people who voted for all the candidates in 2011. 'That's (SPOTY) is an institution and to be voted by the British public was incredible. It topped off the year,' he said. 'It was a great moment and to have Kate Middleton and David Beckham there to give me the award was just amazing.' David Weir has an OBE and won four golds in ten days this summer while Sarah Storrie has an incredible 22 Paralympic medals in swimming and cycling including four golds at London 2012. This quartet are viewed as perfect for the top honour the Queen can bestow. But Danny Boyle, who orchestrated the much-loved Opening Ceremony has also be offered a knighthood, but may also turn it down. The success of London 2012 has been so huge that many who played a big part will be recognised. This means that the usual quota system, which only allows one sporting great to be made Sir or Dame, will be torn up this year. Government rules saying that sportsmen and women can only be handed four CBEs, 20 OBEs, and 38 MBEs will also be steamrollered. Great moment: Decorated sailor Ben Ainslie won his fourth straight gold at London 2012 and could soon become Sir Ben . Iconic image: Paralympic star David Weir celebrates winning Gold during the Men's 800m and won four events in total this summer - he too could soon be knighted . Sporting great: Sarah Storey claims gold in the Womens individual C4-5 Road Race, equalling icon Tanni Grey Thompson and Sarah could now become a Dame . This is because during the Olympics there were 29 gold medallists and 35 Paralympic gold medallists and 185 gold, silver and bronzes across both events this summer. It is rumoured there are so many sporting winners this time they will have their own list within the New Year's Honours' list.

Barack Obama may have won another four years as president, but it's his wife Michelle that may lead the country beyond his second term if Samuel L. Jackson has his way. The Snakes on a Plane star got behind the first lady in a recent interview, saying that Michelle Obama would make a fine president - or a Supreme Court justice 'if she wants.' Despite little indication that she has political aspirations - not to mention that the next election is four years away - Mrs Obama is getting support for her own White House run. Scroll down for video . Political advice: Samuel L. Jackson, who handled superheroes as Nick Fury in The Avengers, says Michelle Obama is 'superwoman' Jackson, who starred as Nick Fury in the Summer blockbuster The Avengers, told Newsweek: 'Michelle is Superwoman. What can’t she do? That's why people love her.' 'She can be on the Supreme Court and anywhere else she wants. She can be the president. She's history and she'll stay history because she is so amazingly smart and together.' And the Pulp Fiction star is not alone. Rep James Clyburn, a Democrat from South Carolina, told the magazine: 'I'd love to see her get more into politics because it would be a breath of fresh air in DC.' Here's to you: President Obama and first lady Michelle applaud on the balcony as they attend the 2012 Kennedy Center Honors on Sunday night . He added: 'She's honest and . straightforward, which is not what you see in Washington much. She is . exactly what we need around here.' While Jackson and Clyburn may be getting excited about Mrs Obama's political future, experts say it's simply not going to happen. Hollywood career: Jackson has just come off a starring role as Nick Fury in the Summer blockbuster The Avengers . Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, told Newsweek: 'Nothing she’s done indicates she wants more power on the national or international front. Yet everyone else says she has to have it.' An unnamed White House official speaking exclusively to the magazine added that Mrs. Obama has no interest in pursuing an elected office. The official said: 'Michelle Obama doesn’t have the temperament for the constant b.s. that goes on in D.C. She watched her husband fight fights that he shouldn't have to. 'She's seen the ugly side of Washington up close and personal and has no interest in dealing with that firsthand. I think she knows there are other ways to impact the system from the outside in.' Wearing a stunning Michael Kors gold lamé dress embellished at the neckline, the first lady dazzled as she entered the East Room of the White House with her husband for Sunday night’s Kennedy Center Honors.

"By . Toby Harnden . PUBLISHED: . 14:46 EST, 9 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 15:50 EST, 9 July 2012 . Barack Obama has delivered on his promise to change America, according to more than two-thirds of voters – the problem for his re-election campaign is that over half of the country believes he has changed it for the worse. A poll conducted for The Hill newspaper by Pulse Opinion Research found that 68 per cent of likely voters feel that Obama has substantially transformed the United States since he took office in January 2009. But while 35 per cent believe the change he has brought is for the better, 56 per cent viewed Obama’s change negatively. Even one in five Democrats believed change had been for the worse. Bold announcement: President Obama said Monday that he would extend the Bush-era tax cuts for those earning below $250,000 annually, which he presumably hopes will paint Romney as out of touch . The poll underlined the task Obama faces in winning a second term, despite dissatisfaction among a number of Republicans about Mitt Romney being their candidate and about the way his campaign is being run. Obama’s difficulties were increased significantly by tepid jobs numbers for June that were released on Friday. They showed that unemployment remained at 8.2 per cent last month, when just 80,000 net jobs were added nationally. In an attempt to shift the focus away from the grim employment and economic picture, the Obama campaign hammered Romney all weekend for investing in a Swiss bank account and an offshore account in Bermuda. Today, Obama sought to bolster this image of Romney as an out-of-touch plutocrat by unveiling a new proposal that the Bush tax cuts should be extended for a year for those earning under $250,000 per annum. This leaves Romney and the Republicans, who believe that no taxes should be raised, having to defend tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and potentially in the position of blocking middle-class tax cuts. ‘Most people agree we should not raise taxes on middle-class families or small businesses - not when so many people are trying to get by,’ Obama said in an East Room statement, which he delivered while surrounded by ordinary Americans he says would benefit from the initiative being enacted. Non-denial: Press Secretary Jay Carney did not say that the President would veto a bill that included tax cuts for all, but said that he would not sign it . He charged that Republicans believed that tax cuts for the rich and ‘top-down economics’ were the way forward. ‘I disagree. I think they’re wrong. ‘I think our prosperity comes from an economy built on a strong and growing middle class. . . . It’s time to let the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, folks like myself, expire.’ The Bush tax cuts are due to expire for all Americans at the end of this year.  Obama previously promised to extend tax cuts only for those at the lower end of the scale but capitulated in a deal with Congress and extended them for everyone. Republicans hit back that Obama’s approach would harm small-business owners. A House of Representatives vote on whether to extend all the tax cuts is scheduled for July 23rd. Obama said that 98 per cent of the public and 97 per cent of small-business owners, would fall under the $250,000-per-year threshold. Although Obama stopped short of threatening a veto, his spokesman Jay Carney said that he would block it – meaning that Obama would be preventing the extension of the very tax cuts he championed today. ‘He would not support it, Carney said. ‘He would not sign that bill.’ John Boehner, Speaker of the House, said: ‘President Obama is still asleep at the switch when it comes to our economy and jobs. In the wake of another weak jobs report, the president is doubling down on his quixotic call for the same small-business tax hikes that have been routinely rejected by the House and Senate.’ Raking in the money: Romney has not appeared publicly in the past few days, as he spent time this weekend (pictured) shuffling between fundraiser's in the ritzy Hamptons beach towns in New York . Andrea Saul, Romney’s spokeswoman, said Obama’s proposal was a ‘a massive tax increase’ that ‘just proves again that the president doesn’t have a clue how to get America working again’ White House Press Secretary Carney said at his daily briefing that Obama would veto any bill that extends the tax cuts for all income levels, arguing that eliminating the tax breaks for wealthier Americans, who don’t need the money, would help pay down the deficit. Obama has long advocated repealing the tax cuts for those making more than $250,000 but congressional Democrats have proposed instead to make the threshold $1million a year. The Romney campaign has accused Obama of dividing Americans and waging class warfare by repeatedly focussing on Romney’s vast personal wealth, previously estimated at up to $250million but potentially more than that. When asked on CNN whether Romney had broken the law, Robert Gibbs, former White House spokesman and now an Obama campaign adviser, said: ‘Well, we don't know.’ Not good: A new poll announced that while a vast majority of Americans agreed that President Obama had changed America, they did not feel it was for the better . ‘The one thing he could do ... to clear up whether or not he's done anything illegal - whether he's shielding his income from taxes in Bermuda or Switzerland - is to do what every other presidential candidate's done, and that's to release a series of years of their own tax returns. ‘This is a guy whose slogan is Believe in America and it should be Business in Bermuda. That's what Mitt Romney's all about.’ Saul described this as an ‘unseemly and disgusting’ character attacks. Despite a barrage of negative ads from the Obama campaign largely about Romney’s wealth, the presidential race remains essentially tied. A USA Today poll of battleground states found that Obama leads Romney by 47 to 45 points among registered voters in a dozen swing states. Some Republican strategists are concerned, however, that the Obama campaign is successfully ‘defining’ Romney as a too wealthy to relate to ordinary Americans and as a businessman who exploited American workers to rake in profits for his company Bain Capital. The Romney campaign, which raised a staggering $106million in June compared to $71million for Obama, calculates that Americans are too fixated on the economy and the impact of the incumbent’s policies to be distracted by the Democratic focus on Romney’s wealth.","Obama on Monday said 'It’s time to let the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, folks like myself, expire.’"

A black meteorologist was fired from an ABC affiliate in Louisiana after she responded to a racist comment left by a viewer about her short hair. Rhonda Lee was fired from her job at KTBS in Shreveport because she wrote a lengthy, considerate response to a viewer who took issue with the way that she chose to cut her hair, saying that she 'needs to wear a wig or grow some more hair.' The viewer wrote 'the black lady that does the news is a very nice lady... im not sure if she is a cancer patient. but still its not something myself that i think looks good on tv.' The commenter identified himself as Emmitt Vascocu, who is a retired white man who lives in the area, and went on to justify his criticism saying that other hairstyles that don't appeal to people are rarely shown on television. 'What about letting someone a male have waist long hair do the news.what about that,' he wrote. Ms Lee responded on October 1, the same day that he made his remark, writing '–I am the ""black lady"" to which you are referring. I'm sorry you don't like my ethnic hair.' 'And no I don't have cancer. I'm a non-smoking, 5'3, 121 lbs, 25 mile a week running, 37.5 year old woman, and I'm in perfectly healthy physical condition,' she continued. Healthy: The commenter said that perhaps Ms Lee has short hair because she has cancer, but she responded saying that was not the case and she was very healthy, even running marathons in aid of cancer charities . Ethnic choice: Ms Lee defended her hairstyle saying that she purposefully chooses to keep it short and feels she is a role model for young African American girls . 'I am very proud of my African-American ancestry which includes my hair. For your edification: traditionally our hair doesn't grow downward. It grows upward. 'Many Black women use strong straightening agents in order to achieve a more European grade of hair and that is their choice. However in my case I don't find it necessary. I'm very proud of who I am and the standard of beauty I display. She went on to say that she thought . that her choice displayed the variety of beauty that the mix of cultures . in America allows, and that she feels she is a role model to young . ethnic girls by refusing to conform. She . concluded her measured response by signing off with a polite 'Thank you . for your comment and have a great weekend and thank for watching.' Commenter: Emmitt Vascocu gave his name when he suggested Ms Lee should wear a wig because her natural hair is not what people expect on television . The Clutch reports that Mr Vascocu went on to say that he was not racist but 'this world has...certain standerd (sic). if youve come from a world of being poor are you going to dress in rags?' The online interaction between Ms Lee and Mr Vascocu occured on October 1, and she was fired shortly after the incident. Her news director and general manager at KTBS said that she violated an unwritten company policy on social media. Ms Lee feels that the decision was motivated by racism, however. Appearing on CNN's Starting Point on Wednesday morning, Ms Lee told Soledad O'Brien 'whereas other people are given platforms, I was given a pink slip'. A petition has been started in her honor, calling for the station to give Ms Lee her job back, and so far it has 534 signatures. Mr Vascocu has also taken some form of a stand, as he posted a veiled message on his Facebook page a few weeks after the incident. Rife with spelling mistakes, he posted: 'To all in ciber land.

A controversial New York Jets player is being sued for child support for the second time in two years after fathering another love child with a different woman. Fashion blogger Ashton Whittington is taking wide receiver Braylon Edwards, 29, to family court in Manhattan after she gave birth to their son last year, the New York Post reported. Model Nik Pace successfully sued Edwards in 2010 after she also had a child by the player.

Fashionista: Ashton Whittington who is suing Braylon Edwards for child support shows off her collection of leather pants on YouTube . Ashton Whittington, the latest claimant against Edwards, gave birth to a baby fathered by the NFL star that very same year. The boy, called Ashton Arthur Whittington, is now 18 months old, according to the Post. 'Braylon and Ashton had a relationship, and around the time he was arrested in September 2010 [for DWI], she became pregnant,' a source said. 'They are no longer together. He knows about his son and is paying interim child support, but Ashton is suing for a more formal child support agreement.' Edwards’ lawyer told the Post that his client is 'honoring his financial obligations, and there is an agreed . [temporary] order in place.' Success: Model Nik Pace won her child support case against Braylon Edwards in 2010. He is now facing another action from a second woman who gave birth to his baby . But Whittington has hired Lauren Mallin, the same top attorney who had previous success against Edwards in a similar case. In 2010 Mallin represented Nik Pace, a finalist on America’s Next Top Model in 2005. Pace also sued Edwards for child support. His legal team tried to hold the case in Georgia, an act described by Pace's lawyers as a 'cold, calculated act to pay less money' as that state generally awards less in child support payments. But the litigation was held in New York and Pace won the case, though it was reported that she was awarded less than her $70,000-a-month demand. Edwards has settled down with new girlfriend, Victoria Bow. On Bow's birthday in March he tweeted a series of messages of undying love to her. New love: Victoria Bow is Braylon Edwards' latest girlfriend. Edwards claimed in March that 'I've never felt like this' Making it official: Braylon Edwards has tweeted extensively of his love for Victoria Bow . 'I've never felt like this. I don't deserve her. Victoria I will never let you down. You are my world and it's official,' he said. Edwards acknowledged his bad-boy history in another tweet: 'It's not about a past or a perception it's about the live she gives to me and I give to her.' The NFL player has regularly made negative headlines. He has been in trouble with police for speeding violations, drink-driving incidents and allegedly punching a friend of NBA star LeBron James outside a nightclub. Edwards recently rejoined the New York Jets after leaving the team in August 2011. He was resigned by the club last week, despite calling the Jets' management 'idiots' on Twitter at the start of December. He is expected to make his debut against the Tennessee Titans tonight.","Braylon Edwards, 29, sued for child support twice in the last two years .

The country’s cheapest Christmas trees were being snapped up for just £1 each yesterday at a branch of Ikea. Bargain hunters rushed to the store in Southampton after the original price was slashed by 96 per cent. And unlike most of the Swedish-owned company’s products there wasn’t even any tricky assembling to do at home – the Nordmann Firs, which are popular because their needles don’t drop, are real. Home products giant IKEA have slashed the price of their Christmas trees to just £1 . The store in Southampton, Hampshire, ordered thousands of real Nordmann Fir Christmas trees but had to drop the price from £25 . Shoppers at the Southampton Store grab themselves bargain ready in time for the big day, including Debbie Andrews (left) and Theresa Bickle (right) Ikea, famous for its flat-pack . furniture, has previously sold artificial Christmas trees but this is . the first year it has offered real ones. They were something of a bargain even at the original price of £25, because a 6ft Nordmann Fir usually costs around £50. But Ikea stores across the country had to discount their prices heavily when they failed to sell at the start of the month. The Southampton branch had ordered thousands of trees and initially reduced them to £5 before cutting the price again to £1. Retired teacher Jenny Harding, 68, of Hythe, Hampshire, said: ‘My son bought his tree from a local garden centre and it cost him £60. I can’t believe that these trees are going for just one pound. It’s the same tree and same quality.’ Theresa Bickle, 43, of Hedge End, said: ‘I had no intention of coming home with a tree, but when I saw the huge amount they had and that they were on offer for one pound I couldn’t resist.’ A staff member at Southampton . confided yesterday that they still had just under 1,300 trees left and . were expecting a ‘late rush’ when word of the bargain spread. He added: ‘We’ve had the trees in for two weeks and struggled to shift them. ‘Now they are just one pound they are flying off the shelves.’ Ikea . stores across the country are selling the trees at varying discounted . prices. Staff in Leeds were effectively paying people to take the trees . by offering a £20 Ikea voucher for every £10 tree bought. A survey last month revealed that fewer than one in five homes will have a real Christmas tree this year. People . told the consumer group Which? that the cost compared to an artificial . version put them off at a time when most were tightening their financial . belts.'

George Osborne faces an uphill battle to maintain Britain’s top notch credit rating next year following the release of data showing the economy is doing less well than hoped. New government borrowing rose sharply to £17.5billion in November. This suggests the Chancellor will find it hard to bring the total deficit for 2012-13 down to £80.5billion as projected in the Autumn Statement just two weeks ago. Task ahead: The Chancellor may struggle to bring the total deficit down to the level projected in the Autumn Statement just a fortnight ago . Dampened: The Olympic-aided bounce in GDP in the third quarter has been downgraded slightly from 1% to 0.9%. Sluggish growth has led to a shortfall in VAT and company tax receipts, as well as higher spending as welfare costs rise. Office for National Statistics figures . show output in the third quarter expanded by 0.9 per cent rather than . the 1 per cent previously reported. Labour immediately attacked the Chancellor over the numbers, accusing him of using ‘smoke and mirrors in the Autumn Statement.’ Labour’s Treasury spokesman Rachel . Reeves said: ‘These figures show that borrowing is rising and is up by . 10 per cent so far this year.’ However, the Government is likely to . hang on to a glimmer of hope – the service sector, which represents as . much as 70 per cent of national output, is improving. A key survey shows that in October – . the first month of the final quarter of the year – the services sector . expanded and construction spending strengthened. If this optimism held into November and December it is possible that a drop back into recession could be avoided. Graph showing initial and revised GDP quarter on quarter growth (Source: ONS) Among the keys to whether another dip . in the economy can be averted will be the Bank of England’s ‘funding for . lending’ scheme, designed to  bring down the cost and ease of home . loans and credit for small and medium sized businesses. If lending by the banks can be . restored, momentum from the housing market and small businesses could . keep the economy buoyant into 2013. Much of the focus of the markets will be on the public finances. All three of the major credit rating . agencies have placed Britain’s ‘AAA’ credit rating, among the best in . the world, on ‘negative watch’. A run of bad monthly deficit and debt . numbers could push the UK over its own fiscal cliff. Fitch reported that the Autumn . Statement ‘weakened the Chancellor’s fiscal credibility’, Moody’s said . it will reassess the ‘AAA’ rating in early 2013 and Standard & . Poor’s has the matter under review. How we compare: International GDP growth rates for the third quarter (Source: ONS) However, market commentators believe . the loss of the rating, while embarrassing for the Chancellor, would not . make much difference to the country’s borrowing costs. This is because the UK is one of few nations with a credible plan to restore stability. City economist Philip Shaw of Investec . said: ‘It’s another month of disappointing deficit data and it’s pretty . clear now that barring unexpected positive developments, the underlying . deficit will widen this year, compared with 2011-12.’ Analysts at Capital Economics warned . if there was further slippage of the economy in 2013 the UK would . ‘possibly lose its AAA rating’. Graph showing workers' pay increases, quarter on quarter (Source: ONS) So far this year the Government has borrowed £92.7billion – £8.3billion more than in the first eight months of last year. However, the end-of-year numbers will . be improved by several one-offs, including a contribution from the Royal . Mail Pension Plan, the sale of new mobile phone spectrum and a gain . from the interest collected by the Bank of England on government debt. Graph showing how the services sector has grown, quarter on quarter (Source: ONS) The latest figures show the national debt – or the accumulated . government borrowing over many years – has reached a record . £1,083billion, or 68.5 per cent of the annual national output. Mr Osborne had promised that by the . time the Coalition leaves office in 2015-16 the national debt would be . falling as a proportion of output or GDP. But the latest figures from . the Office for Budget Responsibility show the first dip will not take . place until 2016-17, when it will fall to 79.2 per cent of GDP, breaking . the government’s fiscal rule. ■ Italian prime minister Mario Monti . resigned last night, keeping a pledge to step down after parliament . approved his budget.  Mr Monti, a respected  economist, took over as . head of a technical government last year as Italy’s borrowing costs . soared.

The shocking claims that a Zumba instructor in Kennebunk, Maine used her dance studio as a place of prostitution has thrown the tight knit New England community into a state of disbelief. Locals who know the accused  Alexis Wright, say she's the last person they thought would get caught up in a headline-grabbing scandal since she was an honors high school student who attended college, ran dance classes for the local parks and recreation program and hosted charity events benefiting Toys for Tots and breast cancer research. The prostitution case involving the bubbly fitness instructor and more than 100 accused clients has made international headlines from this seaside town of 10,000 known for its beaches, charming homes and Tom's of Maine toothpaste, as well as the nearby 'Summer White House' while President George H.W. Bush was in office. Scroll down for video . Accused: Alexis Wright has pleaded not guilty to 106 counts including prostitution and invasion of privacy for her alleged role in the sex scandal . Allegations: Wright is accused of having sex . with up to 150 married men for money in her Zumba exercise studio in . Kennebunk, Maine. She also posted several sex videos online, including a . striptease (right) For local residents, the criminal case has been evolving in slow motion, with police releasing more names of accused clients every two weeks. So far, 39 men have been identified, and more names are being released on Friday. Police said Wright videotaped many of the encounters without her clients' knowledge and kept records suggesting the sex acts generated $150,000 over 18 months. Explicit sex videos also surfaced online. While she is portrayed as Zumba instructor gone wild, those who know her say that there's another side than the one in the news coverage — and that she didn't deserve to have her son removed from her care two weeks ago. Andrew Scherzer, a longtime friend, said Wright is a great mother to her 7-year-old son and has lived a life full of Hallmark-style moments, with camping and canoeing trips and outings to the Portland Children's Museum and the New England Aquarium. 'If you were an outsider and spent time with her and her kid, the last thing you'd suspect is that she had this side business going on,' said Scherzer, who went to high school and reconnected several years ago with the salsa-loving Wright, who attended concerts given by his Afro-Cuban band. Double life: While she is portrayed as a Zumba instructor gone wild, those who know Alexis Wright say she is a great mother to her 7-year-old son and has lived a life full of Hallmark-style moments . Shock: The small town, with a population of 10,000 has been rocked by the sensational allegations . Others feel the same way. Evelyn Barbour, who met Wright, 29, in the fifth grade and remained friendly through high school, said classmates at Mount Ararat High School were genuinely shocked by the charges. 'I thought she was a really nice person. I never, ever saw her be mean or rude to anyone. She was extremely kind,' said Barbour, now a science teacher at the high school. Wright was an honors student at Mount Ararat, where she played field hockey and participated in the concert band, wind ensemble and chamber singers. She played clarinet and left a favorable impression on her band director. 'She was really nice kid, a sweet kid. She worked hard. She did what was expected. She blended in with lots of kids. She didn't stand out in any bad ways. She was just a nice, sweet kid,' said Allen Graffam, the director. After high school, Wright took classes at Keene State College and Southern Maine Community College before earning a natural sciences degree in 2010 from the University of Southern Maine's Lewiston-Auburn College. Around the same time, the single mom was becoming known around Kennebunk for her Zumba classes, first offered in the auditorium of the Town Hall. Revealing: The criminal case has been evolving in slow motion, with police releasing more names of accused clients every two weeks . She hosted Zumba charity events for earthquake victims in Haiti, the Susan G. Komen foundation for breast cancer and Toys for Tots, among others. Those who attended her fitness classes remembered her as fun and energetic. But police said there was more than Zumba going on after she opened a dance studio on Main Street, and later rented an office across the street. Wright, of nearby Wells, has pleaded not guilty to 106 counts including prostitution and invasion of privacy for acts performed in her dance studio and in the rented office. Her business partner, insurance agent Mark Strong Sr., of Thomaston, pleaded not guilty to 59 misdemeanor counts. Sarah Churchill, Wright's lawyer, said the media have presented a one-sided view of her client. Churchill anticipates more information about Wright's good works will make its way into the public's eye as the case proceeds to trial. Wright lives in nearby Wells with her husband, whom she married over the summer. Both have declined to comment, as have other family members. A lawyer who has seen the complete list of Wright's alleged clients says it contains the names of more than 150 men, some of them prominent. The 39 men who have been summoned so far on suspicion of engaging Wright's services include a former mayor and the local high school ice hockey coach. The remaining names will trickle out for weeks to come. As for Scherzer, he said he'd heard that there were sex videos posted online, but he said he figured what Wright did behind closed doors was her business. He knew her as an attentive mom who always had time and energy for her son. He said her husband is a contractor who has supported Wright throughout the ordeal. Regardless of what criminal penalties she faces, she already paid a steep price when her son was removed from her care, Scherzer said. Details of the custody case weren't available, including where her son is, but a judge on Wednesday dismissed a complaint from the boy's father — not her husband — seeking full custody. The father, Benjamin Hopkins, alleged she posed nude in pictures with the boy, who was partially covered with a sheet. The judge dismissed the complaint when neither the father nor Wright showed up for a court hearing on the matter, The Portland Press Herald reported. 'She feels like she's dead right now. She's having the only thing that's important to her ripped away,' said Scherzer, who's worried about his friend. 'Under the circumstances, she's doing what she can, which is to not break down and go crazy and give up.'","Alexis Wright, 29, is accused of running a brothel out of her Zumba fitness studio in the town of Kennebunk, Maine .

Mystery: The naked and decomposing corpse of Gareth Williams, a fit 31-year-old, was discovered in his home in central London in August 2010 . MI6 spy Gareth Williams tied himself up in a bizarre game several years before he was found dead in a sports bag, a coroners’ court heard yesterday. The secret agent was discovered wearing just his boxer shorts by his landlady after shouting ‘help’ because he could not escape. Jennifer Elliot, 71, said his wrists were tightly strapped to the headboard of his bed in her home in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire and her husband used a knife to cut him free. Mr Williams said he was ‘just messing about’ and vowed never to do it again. The episode took place three years before police discovered Mr Williams’s naked body padlocked inside a bag in the bath of his home. It will fuel speculation that the high-flying and reclusive code-breaker died in a sex game that went disastrously wrong. The third day of the inquest into the riddle of his death was dominated by fresh disclosures about the 31-year-old’s private life. It heard he viewed fetish websites aimed at those aroused by confined spaces, as well as bondage and sado-masochism, on his laptop. A shop assistant revealed he regularly bought expensive clothing for his ‘tall and slim’ girlfriend but police have found no evidence of a sexual partner. A friend said she believed Mr Williams was ‘straight’ and not interested . in cross-dressing despite owning wigs, make-up and a £20,000 collection . of women’s clothes. Businesswoman Elizabeth Guthrie, 27, one of Mr Williams’s  few close . friends, revealed he used an alias and had several phones. The bedroom at Williams' rented flat in Cheltenham: His live-in landlady, Jennifer Elliot, discovered him with his wrists attached to the headboard of the bed shown here . Mystery: The spy's body was found inside the bag, padlocked from the outside . Unsolved: Coroner Fiona Wilcox has said that . whether Mr Williams was alive inside the North Face bag like this one . and locked it himself 'was at the very heart of this inquiry' She said they . enjoyed staying in at her Knightsbridge flat and watching DVD box sets. The most extraordinary revelation came in a statement by Mrs Elliot who . rented a flat in her home to the computer science expert for more than a . decade while he worked at the GCHQ listening station. Mrs Elliot said . Mr Williams was polite but extremely private and she could only remember . one occasion on which friends had called for him. One night in 2007 she and her husband Brian were woken by the sound of him shouting for assistance at about 1.30am. They used a spare key to get into the flat and found Mr Williams tightly . bound by each wrist to wooden ‘bobbles’ at either side of the bed’s . headboard. She said he was wearing only boxer shorts and had used some . kind of material, not rope or plastic, which had cut deeply into his . flesh. Mrs Elliot said: ‘My husband said, “What the bloody hell are you . doing?” He said he just wanted to try and get free. Mystery: Mr Williams was found dead locked . inside a holdall in the bath of his flat . At home: The lounge of Mr Williams' flat in Pimlico, London . ‘My husband cut him free. He then said, “Gareth, we can’t have you doing . this”. Gareth apologised and said it would not happen again and offered . to pay more money. ‘We have never spoken to anyone about it since. We both felt it was more . likely to be sexual than escapology or similar but could not be sure. The flat was immaculate and I never saw anything of a sexual or fetish . nature.’ The mystery surrounding Mr Williams’s death has perplexed Scotland Yard’s best detectives during a 20-month inquiry. They have been unable to definitively prove how and when he died and . whether anyone else was involved before he was found at his flat in . Pimlico, Central London, in August 2010. The detective leading the inquiry is convinced that someone else . padlocked Mr Williams in the bag or hoisted it into the bath where it . was found. 'Enjoyed staying in': Friend Elizabeth Guthrie leaving Westminster Coroner's Court in London today . In her evidence Miss Guthrie said the pair planned to attend a fancy dress ball dressed as Japanese cartoon characters. Asked if Mr Williams was interested in cross-dressing, she said: . ‘Nothing of a sexual bent but we were going to a fancy dress ball . together. He was going as a ninja, not as a queen.’ It also emerged yesterday that a novel found in Mr Williams’s flat, . Morvern Callar by Alan Warner, has a plot with some similarities to his . death. In the book a shelf-packer in Oban, Scotland, finds her . semi-clothed boyfriend dead after he commits suicide. She cuts up his . decomposing body and stuffs it in a rucksack. Mr Williams’s immediate boss at MI6 came under fire from a barrister . representing his family for failing to raise the alarm more quickly when . he went missing. The senior intelligence officer did not act as a ‘reasonable, careful . and responsible’ manager, Westminster Coroners’ Court was told. The spy, . who gave evidence from behind a screen and was known only as ‘Witness . G’, denied he knew something ‘horrible’ had happened to Mr Williams. He . said: ‘In hindsight I should have taken more action more quickly and . escalated it.’ At the hearing a female member of Mr Williams’s family collapsed and could be heard hyperventilating behind the screens. The inquest continues. Being tracked? Mr Williams is caught on CCTV in Holland Park on August 14, 2010, just over a week before his naked and decomposing body was found locked in a bag in his Pimlico flat . Suspicions: Mr Williams' body is taken out of his flat. Relatives believe a third party was either present when Gareth Williams died or broke into his home afterwards to destroy evidence .

Agents from the FBI questioned the only known suspect in the Sept. 11, 2012 U.S. consulate attack in Benghazi that killed four diplomats, the suspect's Tunisian lawyer has told The Associated Press. Ali Harzi, a Tunisian, was detained in Turkey and extradited to Tunisia in October where authorities have said he is 'strongly suspected' of being involved in the bloody commando-style attack on the Libyan mission. Additionally, his lawyer, Anwar Oued-Ali, added FBI agents also asked Harzi about the U.S. embassy attack in Tunisia a few days after the assault in Libya, suggesting American authorities are probing a connection between the two incidents. Burning issue: Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed in a six-hour, commando-style attack on the consulate in Benghazi . The Sept. 11 assault by armed men in . the Libyan city of Benghazi killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stephens and . three other American diplomats. Members of an Islamist militia, Ansar . al-Sharia, are suspected in the strike, but there has been little . progress in the Libya-based investigation into the attack. A few days later, a mob attacked the . U.S. embassy in Tunis, destroying property and an American school in the . area, resulting in four deaths. The attack was believed to be . instigated by a local group also called Ansar al-Sharia, but it is . unclear if it is connected to the Libyan organization. Killed: Ambassador Christopher Stevens (left) died of smoke inhalation, while agent Sean Smith (right) died in a . desperate battle with insurgents . Heroic: Former Navy SEALs Glen Doherty (left) and Tyrone Woods (right) were killed in a mortar attack . In early November, Republican senators . Lindsey Graham and Saxby Chambliss announced that Tunisia had agreed to . allow the FBI to interview Harzi, but it took another month and a half . to organize the interview due to legal questions over any infringements . on Tunisian sovereignty. In the end, three FBI investigators . using a Moroccan translator posed questions to Harzi for three hours . through the Tunisian judge presiding over the case. Harzi's defense team was not allowed . to attend the questioning on the grounds that he was being interviewed . as a ""witness"" rather than a defendant. Harzi is being charged by the Tunisians for ""membership in a terrorist organization."" Harzi denies the charges. Attack: A U.S. ambassador and three other Americans were killed in the terror strike that occurred on the eleventh anniversary of 9/11 . Inferno: Armed attackers dumped cans of diesel fuel and set ablaze the consulate's exterior . Siege: The compound came under heavy mortar and gunfire during the attack, which lasted several hours . According to the timeline, around 9.40 p.m. Benghazi time on Sept 11, officials at the CIA's relatively fortified and well-defended base in Benghazi got a call from State Department officials at the U.S. diplomatic mission about a mile away that the less-fortified public mission complex had come under attack from a group of militants. Other official sources said that the initial wave of attacks on the diplomatic mission involved setting fires using diesel fuel. 9.40pm - CIA officials in 'The Annex' get a distress call from the consulate saying they are under attack. 10.05pm - Armed only with handguns, team of about six CIA security officers leave their base for the public diplomatic mission compound. 10.30pm - With bullets whistling overhead, the CIA team move into the compound after unsuccessfully trying to get heavy weapons and help from local Libyan allies. 11.10pm - A Defense Department drone, which had . been on an unrelated mission some distance away, arrived in Benghazi to . help officials on the ground gather information. 11.30pm - U.S. personnel who had been working or staying at the mission all accounted for, except for Ambassador Stevens. 11.40pm - Driving back to the secure base, the evacuees come under further fire. 12am - The installation itself comes under fire from small arms and rocket-propelled grenades. 12am - A CIA security team . based in Tripoli, which included two U.S. military officers, lands at . Benghazi airport and begins plotting how to locate the missing ambassador. 1am - The patchy attacks on the base begin to die down after 90 minutes of fierce fighting. 4am - The . reinforcements from Tripoli take a convoy of . vehicles to the CIA base to prepare for evacuation. 4.30am - a fresh round of mortar attacks is launched on the base, killing two U.S. security officers. 5.30 - A heavily armed Libyan military unit . arrive at the CIA base to help evacuate the compound of U.S. personnel . to the Benghazi airport. From 6am - Roughly 30 Americans, as well as the bodies of . Stevens and the other three Americans killed during the attacks, were . loaded on planes and flown out of the city, several U.S. officials said. The dense smoke created by the fuel both made it hard for people at the compound to breathe and to organize a response to the attack. About 25 minutes after the initial report came into the CIA base, a team of about six agency security officers left their base for the public diplomatic mission compound. Over the succeeding 25 minutes, the CIA team approached the compound, and tried, apparently unsuccessfully, to get local Libyan allies to bring them a supply of heavier weapons, and eventually moved into the burning diplomatic compound, the intelligence official said. At around 11.10pm, a Defense Department drone, which had been on an unrelated mission some distance away, arrived in Benghazi to help officials on the ground gather information. By 11.30, U.S. personnel who had been working or staying at the mission had been rounded up except for Ambassador Stevens, who was missing, the intelligence official said. When they tried to drive out of the diplomatic compound to return to the CIA base, however, the convoy carrying U.S. evacuees came under fire. Once they got back to the CIA base, that installation itself came under fire from what the intelligence official described as small arms and rocket-propelled grenades. These patchy attacks went on for roughly 90 minutes, the intelligence official said. Around the same time, a CIA security team . based in Tripoli, which included two U.S. military officers, landed at . Benghazi airport. Upon its arrival, however, the team spent some time . trying both to arrange local transport and to locate the missing . Ambassador Stevens. After some time . trying to solve these problems, the security team that had flown in . from Tripoli eventually arranged for an armed local escort and extra . transportation, but decided not to go the hospital where they believed . Stevens had been taken. In part this was because they had reason to . believe Stevens was likely dead, and because security at the hospital . was believed, at best, to be 'uncertain,' the intelligence official . said. Not long before dawn, the . reinforcements from Tripoli managed to take themselves and a convoy of . vehicles to the CIA base to prepare for an anticipated evacuation. However, . just after they arrived at the CIA base, the official said, a new round . of attacks on that facility was launched, this time with mortars. Although the mortar attacks lasted only 11 minutes, two US security . officers were killed by a direct hit from one of the shells, the . intelligence official said. Finally, . a bit less than an hour later, a heavily armed Libyan military unit . arrived at the CIA base to help evacuate the compound of U.S. personnel . to the Benghazi airport, the official added. Over . the next few hours, roughly 30 Americans, as well as the bodies of .

Dropped: Gary Neville has abandoned plans to build his eco-home following the displeasure shown by nearby residents . Football star Gary Neville has shelved plans for his controversial 'Teletubbies' eco-home over fears that it would lead to neighbourly feuds. The former Premier League footballer wanted to build a country home almost entirely underground with locals dubbing it the second Teletubbyland- make-believe home of the cuddly TV characters. But now the England coach has ditched the plans for the multi-million pound luxury eco-bunker over concerns that he would be 'alienated' by his neighbours. He said: 'There was a lot of local displeasure around the house and it did shock me - how many people were against it and the wind turbine we planned. 'We certainly weren't looking to become people who were alienating our own community. That's not what we've ever done. 'I love where I live. I will never move from that area, unless something drastic happens and we certainly wouldn't want to alienate ourselves. So we are considering our options and what to do next.' The Sky Sports pundit developed plans to build his five-bedroom grass covered house in the heart of rural Lancashire over three years and was granted planning permission in September. Appearance-wise, there were indeed similarities with the dwelling occupied by the colourful children's TV characters, Tinky Winky, Dipsy, Laa-Laa and Po. Almost all of the home above Bolton in Greater Manchester would have been built into the hillside with petal shaped rooms radiating from a central kitchen and fuelled by a 130ft wind turbine. But the former England international waved bye, bye to the futuristic 8,000sq ft bunker on green belt land in the West Pennine moors over concerns of furore from locals. However, the 37-year-old said he still wants his family, wife Emma and daughters Molly and Sophie, to live in a home completely fuelled by renewable energy. He added: 'I can guarantee that the next house we live in will be all-electric. It will be as efficient as possible.' Futuristic: Plans for the home had included a 130ft wind turbine to provide energy . But the former Manchester United defender who has previously self-built two homes said the design would be much more traditional. He said: 'The windows and cavities will be the best level of insulation I can have and it will perform as a building- but it might look Victorian from outside.' Neville's eco-friendly credentials also stretch to his choice of car as he drives a Vauxhall Ampera, a hybrid electric car. He said: 'The vision of a footballer is that he drives a Ferrari. But in the 20 years I spent driving into the Manchester United car park I can only remember two or three. I'm driving a hybrid electric car that I've only put three tanks of petrol in since May. I'm proud of that.'","Former Manchester United footballer ditches plans for 'Teletubbies' home .

While all the other reindeers may have laughed at him and called him names, not letting him join in their games, it seems Rudolph the reindeer's red nose is invaluable at helping him carry out his Christmas mission. Scientist have solved the puzzle of Rudolph's nose, claiming it is to stop it freezing and to help with the exertion of delivering presents to good children around the globe. They say Rudolph's nose shines so brightly because it is richly supplied with red blood cells which help to protect it from freezing and to regulate brain temperature. Christmas mission: This thermal imaging camera shows a reindeer's nose glowing red like Rudolph's. A new study shows how a rich supply of blood vessels in reindeer noses helps them to regulate their temperature . This superior 'nasal microcirculation' is essential for pulling Santa Claus's sleigh under extreme temperatures. Tiny blood cells known as micro-vessels in the nose are vital for delivering oxygen, controlling inflammation, and regulating temperature, the scientists claim. Norwegian and Dutch researchers knew . how important this regulation is for flying reindeer, especially as they . take to the skies from their frozen home near the North Pole. Not just a song: A reindeer in the Norwegian Arctic showing distinct pink colouration on its nose . They set out to test whether Rudolph's famous red nose was due to 'a highly dense and rich nasal microcirculation' compared with human noses. Using a hand-held video microscope, they first assessed the noses of five healthy human volunteers and found a circulating blood vessel density of 15 mm/mm2. When the technique was applied to two reindeer noses, the researchers found a 25 per cent higher density of blood vessels, carrying a super-rich concentration of red blood cells. They also found a high density of mucous glands scattered throughout the reindeer noses, which they say helps 'maintain an optimal nasal climate during changing weather conditions and extremes of temperature as well as being responsible for fluid transport and acting as a barrier.' Infrared thermal images showed that reindeer do indeed have red noses. Professor Can Ince said: 'The microcirculation of the nasal mucosa in reindeer is richly vascularised and 25 per cent denser than that in humans. 'These factors explain why the nose of Rudolph, the lead flying reindeer employed by Santa Claus to pull his sleigh, is red and well adapted to carrying out his duties in extreme temperatures.' The findings were published in the British Medical Journal.",Study shows Rudolph's nose is shiny because it is richly supplied with blood vessels to protect it from freezing and regulate brain temperature .

As many as half of the 56 men charged to date work or worked in a business associated with home building, planning or construction. Notable among them is Donald Fortin, . 59, owner and founder of Fortin Construction Inc, a company that boasts . of being 'Number one Maine Home Builder for over 20 years,' and advertises itself online as 'A Christian Family Owned Company.'

According to state records, he . donated $1000 to Protect Maine Marriage and organisation set up to . 'defend' marriage in the state from the perceived onslaught from 'gay . rights activists' and 'radical judges' seeking to 'redefine marriage'. He also made a donation of $350 to Senator Garrett Mason a conservative opponent of the state's same-sex marriage ballot. Similarly vocal in his defense of family values is attorney Joe Lewis, identified by Kennebunk Police as one of the men charged with 'engaging a prostitute', and a Portland based lawyer. Mr Lewis, 49, served on the Portland Planning Board from 2008 until summer 2012. In his professional biography he makes great play of his commitment to the community and to his family who are, he says, 'firmly settled in Portland'. He goes on: 'I can honestly say that of all the wonderful places I've had the chance to live in, Portland, ME is exactly where I want to be. 'I'm heavily invested in the community I served on the Portland Zoning Board of Appeal from 2000-2005. I also served on the Portland Planning Board from 2008 until summer, 2012.' He has coached and umpired for the local little League and volunteered in local schools. When approached by MailOnline Mr Lewis declined to comment. Speaking to Portland's Morning Sentinel, Ronald Weitzer, a sociologist at George Washington University and expert on prostitution said that the fact that a large number of  Wright's alleged clients were in such related or similar businesses, 'does suggest that there was some referring going on'. Alexis Wright is said to have kept meticulous notes, a 'Domination Fettish Sheet' and stands accused of having filmed clients in her Zumba studio and rented office . Former Mayor, James Soules, 58, a married father of four with 'lots of explaining to do' to his wife . Attorney Jens Bergen, 54, a 'happy guy who loves his wife and children' Financier Joe Cuetara,63, who lives in a $500,000 waterfront New Hampshire home . Gary Bahklow, 57, a realtor with a string of wealthy clients in search for real estate and timberland . Wright kept meticulous records suggesting a business enterprise that brought in more than $150,000 in 18 months and including a 'Domination Fettish Sheet,' and client list reportedly running to 150 'johns.' This, along with other materials removed from her Zumba studio has formed the basis for much of the Kennebunk Police investigation. An honours student who raised money for good causes, none suspected Alexis Wright of living a double life . Speaking to Mail Online last month Lieutenant Antony Bean Burpee admitted that they were a long way from completing their inquiries. He said: 'We've been investigating since September 2011 and we're nowhere near finished. 'We have to establish probably cause before we can charge these men and we're working through a long list.' The investigation was sparked by a tip off from a 'concerned resident' who had grown suspicious of the frequent male visitors to Wright's dance studio and, later, a rented office across the street. But nobody could possibly have imagined the torrent of allegation and counter-allegation that would follow. To most of those who knew her to that point Wright was simply 'a fun and energetic' girl, a former honours student from neighbouring Wells who took part in charity drives and class trips with her 7-year-old son. She hosted Zumba charity events for earthquake victims in Haiti, the Susan G Komen foundation for breast cancer and Toys for Tots. These are the sort of our-of-hours activities residents of the light-house studded coastline expect of their neighbours. But if the charges against are prove true she did all this while leading a double life that included acts of prostitution and filming clients. So far police have released three . batches of names of men charged with engaging a prostitute. As well as . the peculiar prevalence of contractors, painters, drywall and concrete specialists, . window and flooring professionals, realtors, appraisers and real estate . attorneys the list has included former Mayor James Soule, 58, realtor . Gary Bahklow, 57, attorney Jens . Bergen, 54, financier Joe Cuetara, 63 and local ice hockey coach, Donald . Hill who has since stepped down from his role at Kennebunk High. All . of the accused men sought to prevent their names being made a matter of . public record in an application that was last month denied in . Cumberland County Superior Court by Justice Thomas Warren. Picture Perfect: Kennebunk had long been known simply for its white beaches, light-house studded coastline, lobster and proximity to the Bush family's summer home . They are not the only men seeking to distance themselves from Alex Wright, the Zumba instrutcor who allegedly employed a number of online aliases to advertise her willingness to 'have fun(Sex) with both men and women'. The lawyer acting for Mark Strong, 57, Wright's former business partner and alleged co-conspirator, has applied to have Strong's case heard separately from the dance instructor. According to Strong's lawyer, Daniel Lilley, this is because Wright faces far more serious felony charges than Strong who has been charged with 59 misdemeanours - all of which he denies. She has been charged on 106 counts of prositution, invasion of privacy, conspiracy, tax offences and receving welfare benefits when ineligible for welfare. Mr Lilley said, 'It is guilt by association and we woudl just as soon go this month on our own, by ourselves.' Mr Lilley is also hoping that his client's trial can be heard before Christmas - an impossiblity for Wright as the police continue to issue summonses, and release names, pushing the trial well into next year.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 16:49 EST, 26 November 2011 . It is one of the defining images of Christmas, as children cosy up to Santa on his knee to tell him exactly what presents they want. But in an age of 'government guidance' and overcautious school bosses, it was only a matter of time before it became a tradition of the past. A rising number of schools are now forbidding children from sitting on Santa's knee, with increasing numbers of teachers banning any physically contact with Santa at all. Thing of the past: The scene of children sitting on Santa's knee could be over after government guidance suggested there should be no physical contact between Father Christmas and children. With those playing 'Santa' no longer required to pass a CRB check, more and more schools are opting to 'err' on the side of caution and impose strict rules on children visiting Father Christmas. Parents who volunteer for the role of Santa don't have to undergo CRB checks as they do not come into regular contact with children. But those who want to don the red suit and big festive white beard can now only do in many schools as long as they are not left alone with the children and don't let them sit on their laps. Government guidance now states: 'Under no circumstances must a volunteer who has not obtained a CRB disclosure... be left unsupervised with children.' Russell Hobby, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, told the Daily Telegraph this ruling meant many members had decided it is better if Santa avoided all physical contact with children. He said: 'The climate we work in, and the risk of getting it wrong, mean many school leaders err on the side of cuation. 'And if you are going to 'err' on the side of caution, that's the side most parents would prefer.' A spokesman for the Department for Education said children could still sit on Father Christmas’s knee as long as parents were consulted and were 'completely comfortable' with the situation. Christine Blower, of the National Union of Teachers, told the Telegraph: 'It would be a great shame if misinterpretation of regulations deterred schools from traditional festive celebrations.'",Government guidance stresses Santa 'cannot be left with children unsupervised'

Police escort: Members of the Staffordshire-based All Woman choir are pictured ahead of their performance in Stoke-on-Trent . Ninety members of a women’s choir mostly consisting of pensioners were left stunned when they were given a police escort as they travelled to their Christmas concert after bungling police officers mistook them for football fans. Two police motorcylists with flashing blue lights swooped on two coaches carrying the women last Saturday in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, before ordering the vehicles to follow them for 10 miles. Officers picked up the coaches after mistaking them for Chesterfield fans on their way to watch their team play Port Vale in a Football League Two fixture, and repeatedly circled them while they were escorted to Vale Park stadium. But their mistake was only realised when one of the officers boarded the coach and apologised to dozens of bemused members of the Staffordshire-based All Woman choir. Liz Talbort, 38, who founded the 250-women strong choir 12 months ago, said: ‘It was hilarious really but a little embarrassing for the police. The women all thought it was a hoot. ‘When the police officer walked onto the coach, the ladies started singing Stoke City's anthem “Why Delilah” as a bit of a joke. ‘Apparently the coaches carrying the real fans were held up as a result of the mix-up and ended up getting to the game 30 minutes late.’ The choir, which is made up of women aged 18 to 80, was travelling to Kings Hall in Stoke-on-Trent for a rehearsal ahead of their Christmas concert when they were ordered to follow the police riders. Correct venue: The choir, which is made up of women aged 18-80, was travelling to Kings Hall in Stoke-on-Trent for a rehearsal ahead of their Christmas concert when they were ordered to follow the police riders . Grandmother-of-one Carol Mitchell, 68, a retired theatre manager who sings as an alto in the choir was on one of the coaches when it was pulled over. She said: ‘We were all looking forward to performing at the concert which was a sell-out and all our family and friends were going along. ‘We were due to start rehearsing at the Kings Hall in Stoke at 2pm but before we got into the city we saw two police motorbikes scream past us with their lights on and sirens going. ‘They indicated to the driver to follow them so while one went ahead the other rider brought up the rear while circling the coaches when he could. ‘At first we thought there might have been some trouble in Stoke and maybe the police were giving us an escort to the concert hall for our safety. ‘We realised something was amiss when the police took us past the turning for the Kings Hall and we approached Port Vale's football ground. Destination: Officers picked up the coaches after mistaking them for Chesterfield fans on their way to watch their team play Port Vale, and repeatedly circled them while they were escorted to Vale Park stadium . Football match: Chesterfield's players celebrate the second goal during their game with Port Vale on Saturday . ‘The women all started talking excitedly and one said: “I bet they think we're football hooligans because we're in coaches”. ‘One of the police riders stopped his bike and indicated to the driver to let him on. By this time we knew they had obviously got the wrong coaches, so we started singing “Why Delilah”. 'It was hilarious really but a little embarrassing for the police. The women all thought it was a hoot' Liz Talbort, 38, All Woman choir founder . ‘The poor policeman stood up at the front, looked at these rows of rows of mostly grannies wearing their dresses and he suddenly went white as a sheet. 'He just stood there and said: “You're not football fans, are you?"" He quickly apologised and got off the coach before making a few calls. We couldn't help it, we all fell about.’ Due to the mix-up the women arrived at the Kings Hall an hour later but the concert went ahead that night as planned.

Michael Delaney was forced to undergo major surgery after swallowing his magnetic tongue studs . A fashion craze almost cost a teenage boy his life after he swallowed the magnetic tongue studs he was wearing. Michael Delaney, 15, was only hours from death and needed surgery when the studs, which are much more powerful than ordinary magnets, began making holes in his digestive system. The metal decorations, usually from three to five millimetres across, are worn on either side of the tongue, held in place by their magnetism so they look like a piercing but without the hole. But they can react with stomach acids and cause lethal internal damage. If they end up in different parts of the intestine the powerful magnets in some studs can make holes in the soft tissue as they are drawn back together. Last night Michael’s family issued a warning to youngsters to be aware of the danger if they were to swallow the studs, which are freely available in Britain. They are popular because they allow teenagers to look as if they have had a piercing without incurring the wrath of their parents. Michael swallowed his on the  bus to school but thought nothing more about it until a fortnight later when he began to have crippling stomach ache. He was admitted to hospital as an emergency with suspected appendicitis. Surgeons had to cut into his bowel in three places to retrieve the studs and later told him he had been only four hours from dying. He was one  of four pupils at St Matthew’s  Roman Catholic High School in Moston, Manchester, who swallowed the jewellery. Three girls, aged between 13 and 16, were admitted and given the all-clear. The magnets are designed to sit on either side of the tongue. Right: Surgeons at North Manchester General Hospital had to cut into Michael's bowel in three places to retrieve the magnetic studs . The school has urged any other pupils who swallowed the studs to go straight to hospital. Michael, of Harpurhey, Manchester, said: ‘It was a really frightening experience. ‘I couldn’t walk, talk or even move, and the thought that I could be dead if I hadn’t gone into hospital is really scary. ‘They couldn’t figure out what was . wrong with me, and found them when they put a camera inside me and the . magnets stuck to the camera. ‘I just had a really intense stomach ache but it never occurred to me that it might have been the studs. ‘I’d swallowed them two weeks before but just thought they’d pass through. A CT scan of Colorado schoolgirl Lauren Garcia clearly shows the magnetic balls, which stuck to her small intestine and began burrowing through it . ‘I thought they were safe but now I . know how serious magnets can be and I’d say to anyone who uses these . studs that you’re putting yourself in real danger by putting them in . your mouth.’ Michael spent almost a week in hospital and now faces a four-week wait to find out if the damage to his bowel will be permanent. His father, also called Michael, said: . ‘If he’d been a seven or eight-year-old it could have killed him. It’s . really important that people are made aware of the dangers.’ It is believed the studs had been distributed around the school by another pupil who had brought them back from a holiday. The packaging defined the product as . ‘facial studs’ and showed a cartoon picture of a boy wearing the . accessory on his tongue. Rob Wall, deputy head at St Matthew’s, said: . ‘As soon as we were aware of what had happened to Michael, we circulated . warnings to the parents and the teachers and we also made other schools . in the area aware of what had happened. ‘We also urged any pupils who thought . they may have swallowed anything magnetic to go straight to hospital as a . precautionary measure. ‘Our thoughts are with Michael and . his family at what has been a very distressing time and we are glad to . see the message is getting out there of the potential dangers.’ The fashion accessories have already been flagged up as a potential health risk in America following a number of similar cases. Last year, Lauren Garcia, 13, of Wheat . Ridge in Colorado, required surgery after magnetic studs that she had . swallowed made several holes in her intestines.","Magnets are designed to sit on either side of the tongue to hold stud in place .

A dentist is facing up to five years in jail after she admitted sending a text message at the wheel as she knocked down and killed a dog-walker. Kay Nolan, 45, had pulled over in a lay-by to compose the message on her mobile phone but had set off again by the time she pressed ‘send’. As she did so, she ploughed into Stuart Mather, 60, a grandfather who was walking his Scottish terrier, Hamish. Kay Nolan, left, knocked down and killed Stuart Mather, right, while sending a text message in June last year . Both Mr Mather and his dog were then hit again by the car behind Nolan. Mr Mather was taken by air ambulance to hospital but died later. His dog also perished. Nolan, who works as a dentist at a . practice near Burnley, had been facing a charge of causing death by . dangerous driving – which carries a maximum 14-year prison sentence. But on the day she was due to stand . trial by jury, lawyers allowed her to plead guilty to the lesser charge . of causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving. The charge carries a minimum sentence of 15 months and a maximum of five years. Last night the family of the victim were too upset to speak about the tragedy. 'It sends out the wrong message that taking and destroying lives on roads is treated leniently' But Richard Coteau, of road safety . charity Brake, said: ‘Brake believes it is inappropriate to prosecute . someone whose bad driving has killed or seriously injured for “careless” driving, because if you have killed or maimed through your bad driving, . your actions were by definition dangerous. ‘Brake is very concerned that fewer . and fewer road death cases are being prosecuted under the charge of . causing death by dangerous driving. ‘This means that in many cases people . who kill through their bad driving are receiving unduly low sentences . that do not reflect the harm they have caused, do not act as a deterrent . and send out the wrong message that taking and destroying lives on . roads is treated leniently.’ The tragedy occurred at 5.20pm on June . 6, 2011, as Nolan was on her way home to the village of . Thornton-in-Craven near Skipton, North Yorkshire. Mr Mather, a Campaign for Real Ale . member who had two sons and three grandchildren, was taking Hamish for . his regular walk. Nolan, in her silver Honda Jazz car, pushed the button . to send her text message as she drove down the road. Police said her . car then hit Mr Mather and his dog, who were both then hit again by a . Vauxhall Astra travelling behind. No one in either car was injured but . Mr Mather suffered horrendous injuries and despite the efforts of medics . at Royal Blackburn Hospital, he later died. Nolan was charged last January with . death by dangerous driving but Robert Elias, prosecuting, told Preston . Crown Court on Monday that the Crown Prosecution Service had decided to . accept her guilty plea to the lesser charge after discussions with Mr . Mather’s family. Nolan, who has no previous convictions, will be sentenced on December 17. An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Stuart Mather was hit by a car that was being driven by Kay Nolan as she was sending a text message. It also incorrectly stated that Miss Nolan was pulling out of a layby in Higham when in fact it was Padiham. And also that Miss Nolan had a collision with a Vauxhall Astra. Nor did Miss Nolan send a text seconds after the collision with Mr Mather.","Kay Nolan killed Stuart Mather and his dog, Hamish, in June 2011 .

Miles apart: The Humboldt penguin (left) lives on rocky islands in South America while Emperor penguins (right) live in the Antarctic and enjoy freezing conditions . Onlookers said the birds, which . usually nest on the warm Pacific coasts of Peru and Chile, spent much of . the ten-minute show falling over. Professor Rory Wilson, of Swansea . University, who has studied penguins for 32 years, said:  'Humboldts are . a tropical penguin used to a very warm climate in Chile and they will . never, ever come across ice in their natural environment. If they looked . cold then they probably were.' A spokesman for People for the Ethical . Treatment of Animals said of the event at Liverpool's ONE shopping . complex three weeks ago: 'This can only have left them petrified and . disoriented.' TV cameras rolled as a keeper tried to coax the birds with fish as they walked around the arena. PETA, which has celebrity supporters including Mickey Rourke, Jessica Jane Clement and Pamela Anderson, slammed the event as ‘disrespectful, out of touch and tragic’. Entertainment: Children and parents watched as the penguins walked across the ice rink in Liverpool . Out of their comfort zone? PETA said the animals could have been left petrified and disorientated . Away from home: The animals belong in the water and on rocky islands off the coast of South America, PETA said . This is unlike other species of penguin, such as the Emperor penguin, which enjoys the snow and ice and freezing conditions of the Antarctic. A spokesperson from PETA said: ‘Anyone who has seen the beautiful film March of the Penguins would find this publicity stunt disrespectful, out of touch and tragic. ‘As the movie illustrates these fascinating birds have a rich and free life. ‘They do not deserve to be exploited as props, kept in tiny enclosures and denied all that is natural and familiar to them. ‘Forcing penguins to endure the stress of being hauled around and released onto a patch of ice in front of hordes of shoppers can only leave them petrified and disoriented.’ On show: The five penguins were coaxed across the ice as spectators looked on . Day out in Liverpool: The penguins were showcased to shoppers in the city . They added that penguins can transmit numerous diseases that can be harmful to pregnant women. ‘It is reckless and cruel to take Humboldt penguins or any animals and deliberately place them in a frightening and wholly unsuitable environment such as a tiny ice enclosure when they belong in the water and on the rocky islands off the coast of South America.’ Stephen Ware, a vet at Heythrop . Zoological Gardens in Oxfordshire, which owns the penguins,  said: 'At . no time have the penguins exhibited any distress in their surroundings.' A spokesman for Liverpool ONE said: 'Liverpool ONE prides itself on only working with reputable suppliers, we have a robust process in place to ensure that the health and safety of our shoppers, staff and suppliers is always of paramount importance in everything we do. 'The company that brought the penguins to Liverpool ONE is held in high regard in their industry. They have worked with high profile entertainment and educational organisations on an international scale and are experts in their field. 'Based on expert advice we are confident that the welfare of the penguins was always their priority.'","Humboldt penguins live on rocky islands on the warm Pacific waters of Peru and Chile - not in the Antarctic .

Anger: Mr Hall's soliicitor said her client should not have had to suffer the ignominy of being arrested at home at dawn . He was taken to a police station where he was questioned by detectives for several hours before being charged with three counts of indecent assault on girls aged between eight and 17 between 1974 and 1984.

Hundreds of ‘mutinous’ passengers aboard a cruise ship ravaged by the winter vomiting bug are planning a sit-in protest when it returns to port today. Travellers on the P&O cruise liner Oriana are furious after some 400 were left quarantined in their cabins with norovirus. They claim many sick passengers had to queue for hours to see the ship’s doctor before being rudely ordered to stay in their cabins. They said the liner turned into a ‘plague ship’, with restaurants operating only limited service and an overwhelming stench of vomit below deck. Scroll down for video . Discontent: Paul Gilman , 62, a retired accountant who is on the Oriana with his wife Carolyn, said there is a 'wave of support for further action' One traveller, who had to be treated by the ship’s doctor, was told he had racked up more than £1,000 in medical bills. Passengers accused senior officers of ‘lying’ about the extent of the norovirus problem and failing to address their concerns. Last night the ship, with 1,843 passengers on board, was returning to Southampton. It is due to leave again with a fresh intake of passengers at 5pm. But dozens of the current passengers, many of them middle-aged and elderly, say they will stage a sit-down protest on their arrival at the port over the way the ten-day Baltic cruise has been run. One elderly female passenger said: ‘We’re going to stage a sit-down or a protest of some form on board the liner before we get off. ‘We’re all respectable middle-class travellers of a certain age. I have never been on a protest in my life but this trip has infuriated me. ‘People are angry because they had an . outbreak on board on the previous cruise and there are questions over . whether it should have gone to sea so quickly afterwards.’ Paul . Gilman, 62, a retired accountant, said: ‘The captain has jokingly told . us we shouldn’t storm the bridge but there has been huge discontent on . this cruise and there is a wave of support for further action.’ Graham . Hodgson, 68, added: ‘There has already been a meeting of 300 passengers . on board who were all determined something should be done. People will . certainly be letting P&O know what they feel about the whole thing . when they get into port.’ Passengers . are furious that the cruise was allowed to go ahead even though dozens . of passengers had been taken ill on with norovirus on its previous . voyage. They say the ship must not have been properly cleaned – something the company strenuously denies. Elizabeth Dobson of Sheffield, who was on . the previous cruise around the western Mediterranean, said: ‘It was . awful. There were so many people on board who were sick. When I heard . this latest cruise had suffered it I was not surprised.’ Outbreak: Passengers on board the P&O cruise liner have been struck down by the winter vomiting bug . Tour: The ship was visiting Christmas markets around Europe, starting in Zeebrugge and Amsterdam before moving on to Hamburg (pictured inset), Copenhagen and Oslo then returning home to Southampton . Oriana has been on a ten-day cruise to the Christmas markets of northern Europe and docked at Zeebrugge (Bruges), Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Oslo and Hamburg before returning to Southampton. Passengers paid up to £1,429 for a balcony cabin, £949 for an outside view cabin or around £799 for an inside cabin. Oriana passenger Mary Smith, 67, died three days after disembarking in 2009 after she became ill on board with suspected norovirus. Southampton Port Authority said an inspection of the Oriana would be carried out after cleaning to ensure it had properly managed its outbreak plan. It said 378 passengers and 25 crew had fallen ill. A spokesman for Carnival, the parent company of P&O Cruises, said no one on board would have to pay their medical expenses.

An outbreak of the winter vomiting bug has hit passengers on board a luxury cruise ship for a festive tour of Europe's Christmas markets. At least 150 of the almost 2,000 holidaymakers sailing on P&O's Oriana are reported to have been taken ill. One passenger, who claimed crew members had ignored the plight of those stricken by the bug, described the trip as 'a cruise to hell'. Scroll down for video . Passengers also claim they have been told that if they catch the virus it is their own fault for not being clean enough . Retired fireman Dave Stringer, 57, of Walsall, West Midlands, told the Sun newspaper: 'There might be a riot because the captain and crew just refuse to listen. 'We'll refuse to disembark unless we get some answers,' he said. Another tourist described the trip as a 'nightmare' in a review posted on a travel website. The passenger, writing under the user name Gibbons, described how corridors and toilets on board the liner 'smelt strongly of sick'. 'We just wish we had never booked,' the review went on. Passengers are understood to have begun falling ill within hours of the liner setting sail for a tour of the Christmas markets of Zeebrugge, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Oslo and Hamburg on December 4. The ship is due to dock at . Southampton tomorrow. While passengers tourists on board claimed hundreds of people had been affected by the bug, P&O has said just nine cases of norovirus had been confirmed on Oriana.

A former Army doctor failed to protect Iraqi detainees and acted dishonestly after the death  of a prisoner, medical watchdogs ruled yesterday. Baha Mousa, 26, a hotel night receptionist who had been arrested by British soldiers in Basra, suffered 93 injuries while in custody. But Dr Derek Keilloh, an Army doctor with the 1st Battalion, Queen’s Lancashire Regiment, claimed he saw no evidence of injuries as he tried to resuscitate him. Dr Derek Keilloh pictured today at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester, where he was found guilty of misleading and dishonest conduct . Although Mr Mousa was collapsed on the floor with soldiers standing around him, Dr Keilloh said he saw only a little dried blood around his nose. However Dr Keilloh, now a GP in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, was found guilty of misleading and dishonest conduct at a hearing of the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service. It will decide today whether his fitness to practice is impaired as a result of the findings. If so, he could be struck off the medical register. On September 14, 2003, British troops found AK47s, sub-machine guns, fake ID cards and military clothing. Mr Mousa and other detainees were arrested at a hotel in Basra and brought in for questioning. Mr Mousa was hooded with a sandbag and assaulted. His 93 injuries included broken ribs and a broken nose. Victim: Hotel receptionist Baha Mousa, pictured with his . late wife and their two children, was beaten to death while in Army custody in . Basra in 2003 . Another detainee, Ahmad Maitari, described hearing Mr Mousa shout out: ‘I’m going to die! Why do you do this? I do not support Saddam.’ At around 9.30pm on September 15, 36 hours after Mr Mousa was arrested, Dr Keilloh was summoned to the detention area. He was told it was a medical emergency. Soldiers were standing around Mr Mousa and one medic blurted out: ‘Look at the state of him’. Dr Keilloh and his team tried for half an hour to resuscitate Mr Mousa before he was declared dead. Dr Keilloh, who was 28 at the time and originally from Aberdeen, denied dishonesty and misconduct in his treatment of Mr Mousa and other civilian detainees. But the tribunal said the extent of the injuries ‘must have been apparent’ to Dr Keilloh. It found he failed to conduct an adequate examination, failed to assess other detainees or protect them from further mistreatment and failed to tell senior officers what was going on. Incident: Dr Derek Keilloh, left, was found guilty by the General Medical Hearing after he was accused of concealing the injuries inflicted on Baha Mousa, . right, in Iraq in 2003 . The panel said he engaged in ‘misleading and dishonest’ conduct when, at subsequent courts martial and a public inquiry, he maintained under oath he saw no injuries to Mr Mousa. Lawyers for Dr Keilloh said he would make no comment until the hearing was finished. In 2006, Corporal Donald Payne of the Queen’s Lancashire Regiment became the first member of the British armed forces to be convicted of a war crime after pleading guilty at a court martial to inhumanely treating civilians in the incident. He was cleared of manslaughter and perverting the course of justice but dismissed from the Army and jailed for a year. Six other soldiers were cleared of all charges. A public inquiry strongly criticised the ‘corporate failure’ by the Ministry of Defence. In July, 2010, the MoD agreed to pay £2.83million in compensation to the families of Mr Mousa and nine other Iraqi men abused by British troops.","Baha Mousa suffered 93 injuries following beating by British soldiers .

A railway guard found guilty of manslaughter following the death of a teenage girl who fell under a train was jailed for five years today. Christopher McGee, 45, took a 'terrible risk' by giving the signal for the driver to depart as Georgia Varley, 16, was leaning against the carriage, a judge said. The sixth-form college student, who was drunk on a night out in Liverpool with friends, fell between the train and the platform at the city’s James Street station in October last year as a result of McGee's 'appalling disregard for her safety', a court heard. Killed instantly: Teenager Georgia Varley (pictured) fell under a moving train after the guard gave the order to set off as she drunkenly leaned against the carriage . Georgia Varley just moments before she was killed after falling between a train and the platform at James Street station in Liverpool . Georgia, who was leaning against the train when the railway guard gave the signal for it to leave, was seen to stagger and fall into the gap as it moved away from the platform. McGee was found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence following a two week trial at Liverpool Crown Court. Jailing McGee for five years today, Mr Justice Holroyde said: . 'You did not intend to kill or even injure her, but you displayed an . appalling disregard for her safety and she paid for your criminal . negligence with her life.' 'You displayed an appalling disregard for her safety and she paid for your criminal negligence with her life' Mr Justice Holroyde . Passing sentence, the judge said: 'In . my judgement, the CCTV footage is unequivocal, Georgia Varley was not . moving away and she was not showing any sign of moving away. 'She only moved when the movement of the train deprived her of support and caused her to lose balance and fall to her death. 'I . am satisfied that you merely hoped and assumed she would get out of the . way when the train began to move, and on that wholly inadequate basis . you took a terrible risk,' he added. 'You must have known that a passenger who falls between the train and the platform is likely to be killed,' he told the defendant. 'As the guard of the train, you were in complete control of the movement of the train. That control carries with it the direct and personal responsibility for the safety of passengers.' After the sentencing Georgia's father Paul Varley said it felt as though the day of his daughter's tragic death had lasted for 13 months for her heartbroken family, as they awaited the outcome of McGee's trial. Mr Varley tearfully described Georgia as 'somebody very special' as he paid tribute to his daughter outside the court. 'It’s taken eleven jurors just over two hours to make the right decision based on the evidence given them to convict Christopher McGee of manslaughter,' he said. 'There are no winners here. Georgia was somebody very special and very unique. 'The 22nd of October 2011 has lasted for 13 months. Our family now have to try and move forward with our loss. 'Please respect our privacy and let us grieve in peace,' he added. 'Deliberate act': Georgia (left) died because guard Christopher McGee (right) gave the signal for the train to leave 'even though he could not have failed to realise that she was in contact with the carriage', the court was told at an earlier hearing . 'Evidence': The prosecution played the jury a 30-second CCTV video of Georgia leaning against the train when it moved out . Grief: The family of teenager Georgia Varley leave Liverpool Crown court . Georgia, from Moreton, Wirral, had gone into Liverpool for a night out with her friends when the incident happened on October 22 last year. A blood analysis following her death showed she had 236mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood in her system - the legal driving limit is 80mg. She also had 0.083mg of the drug mephedrone, or Mcat, in her system at the time of her death. The jury was shown shocking CCTV footage of the teenager’s death. Georgia was seen mistakenly getting off the train just before 11.30pm, and then turning around and leaning against the side as she realised her friends were still on board. The Birkenhead Sixth Form College student was then seen to stagger and fall down the gap as the train moved off, before stopping after travelling around 30ft. Mr Justice Holroyde told the defendant today: 'Much has been made on your behalf . during this trial of how intoxicated Georgia was, but that did not . relieve you of the duty of care which you owed to her. 'You alone determined whether the train remained stationary or began to . move. Your decision and your action determined whether Georgia Varley . was safe from risk.' 'There are no winners here': Georgia's heartbroken father Paul Varley, seen right with with the teenager's mother Paula Redmond, described his daughter as 'very special and very unique' The judge, who pointed out that McGee had been 'repeatedly trained and instructed' in safety matters during his career with Merseyrail, described the suffering of Miss Varley's family in the wake of the tragedy. 'When a crime of homicide is committed, one life is ended but many more lives are damaged or destroyed,' he said. 'In an eloquent written statement, Georgia Varley’s mother has made very clear the excruciatingly painful sadness which she suffers. Of course, she is not alone in grieving; Georgia’s father, her wider family and her friends have all suffered and will continue to suffer. 'No sentence of the court can bring back their loved one, or make up for their loss,' he added. The judge added that McGee’s negligence could be 'measured in seconds' and 'must . be viewed against a background of more than 20 years conscientious . service on the railways'. Scene: The tragedy happened at 10.30pm one night in October last year when Georgia and her friends arrived at the city's James Street Station (above) in Liverpool . 'She was my entire family': The teenager's mother, Paula Redmond, left, described Georgia, right, as a 'wonderful, amazing daughter' During the two week trial, the prosecution said McGee gave the . signal to the driver to start the train when Georgia was in contact with . the train and was in an 'intoxicated state'. Giving evidence, McGee had told the jury he . thought Georgia was moving away from the train when he gave the signal . to depart. He also said he did not know how drunk she had been. 'To say she was a wonderful, amazing daughter would be a massive understatement. She was the best' Georgia Varley's mother Paula Redmond . Georgia’s mother, Paula Redmond, 41, said after the verdict: 'As a parent, Georgia was our only child. In fact, for me, she was my entire family. 'To say she was a wonderful, amazing daughter would be a massive understatement. She was the best. 'Such a lovely, polite, respectful young lady, who was popular and full of fun and laughter.” Ms Redmond said her daughter was 'an absolute joy to be around'. She added: 'Everybody who knew Georgia, of which there are many, loved her because of these and so many other qualities. 'We have listened as our daughter was portrayed as being a drunken liability when, in all honesty, she did no more than what many teenagers do of a weekend - she went out to celebrate her friend’s birthday. 'The only liability that night was a train guard whom Georgia had the catastrophic misfortune to encounter. 'For he had very little, if any, regard at all for our daughter and her safety. 'Christopher McGee will complete his sentence and return to his family. Mine is now gone forever.' Ms Redmond added: 'May our baby girl finally rest in peace.'","Georgia Varley died after falling between a train and the platform on a night out in Liverpool .

A brave father saw off four masked raiders armed with knives who burst into his home and threatened his wife and daughter. Zahir Nabi raced down the stairs, punched the thug holding a blade to his wife’s neck and then launched a ferocious attack on the remaining three raiders. They fled the family home empty-handed with Mr Nabi in pursuit. He followed then down the road until he was sure his family was safe. Last night he was praised by police who said he showed both incredible bravery and strength in fighting off the gang. Mr Nabi, 41 was getting changed in the bathroom after coming home from work when the raiders struck. His wife Shamim, 33, opened the front door and was confronted by four masked men who forced their way into the house in Salford. One knifeman grabbed her around the face and pointed his blade at her neck. Mr Nabi – who is known as Zac –  said: ‘I heard the front door open fast and loud like it hit against the radiator. Next thing I know my wife is screaming. I thought at first it might have been a dog running in the house or something. ‘Her screaming was getting louder so I popped my head round the door and saw a masked man grappling her with a knife at her chest pointing to her neck. ‘I literally launched myself from upstairs on to the bannister and all the way down to the bottom and hit straight into the man. I got him out the way by punching him, elbowing him and kicking him. ‘There was another one in the doorway and so I punched him too. Then I realised there were two more in the lounge where my daughter was. She was screaming in fear because she would have seen all the commotion. I came into the lounge and they came at me with a knife. He added: ‘They were right next to my . daughter Sumaiya – I didn’t know what they were going to do with the . knife. For all I know they were going to use it on her. Zahir Nabi dashed out of his bathroom to find one of the thugs pushing a knife to wife Shamim's neck and demanding cash as their seven-year-old daughter looked on in terror . ‘I kicked and punched them both before . kicking them all out of the house one by one. I must have been fuelled . by adrenaline because I am not normally like that.’ The father-of-one said: ‘If I wasn’t . in the house at the time, God only knows what could have happened.

The Prime Minister said burglary was a . ‘violent crime’ and pledged that victims will be able to use necessary . force to protect themselves without being prosecuted.

Stuart Hall’s distinctive tones, exuberant delivery and often florid football match reports have enlivened the airwaves for five decades. Along the way, the veteran broadcaster has earned ‘national treasure’ status – not least for his equally over-excitable commentaries on It’s A Knockout. As competitors clad in giant, silly . costumes hurled themselves around obstacle courses and frequently fell . over, Hall regularly failed to suppress his mirth and his fits of . incoherent laughter became, for many, as big a part of the popular BBC .

So popular was the show, which Hall presented from 1972 to 1982 (as well as several subsequent special shows), that nearly one in three surveyed in a recent poll said it was one of the bygone features of British life they would most like to return. Hall, who was raised in Hyde, Manchester, and Glossop, Derbyshire, joined the BBC in 1959 as a general reporter on Radio Newsreel. Between 1965 and 1990 he presented the BBC’s regional news programmes for the North West. A lifelong Manchester City supporter, Hall was the original host of BBC quiz A Question Of Sport. He still works as a football reporter for BBC Radio 5 Live, where his reports often feature allusions to Shakespeare and various linguistic gymnastics. He claims to have coined the phrase the ‘beautiful game’ to describe football. In 1999 a House of Commons motion, congratulating Hall on his 40-year career, stated: ‘His rich mellifluous voice is redolent of Sinden and Gielgud intertwining Shakespeare, Keats, Wordsworth et al amid the mud and tears at Accrington Stanley.’ Hall was awarded the OBE last December in the New Year Honours list for his services to broadcasting and charity. He . said afterwards: ‘I’ve always regarded myself as a second-rate . provincial hack. Well, that was yesterday.

They seemed to be a typical couple of tourists – at least, that’s what the staff of the £48-a-night Hotel Choiseul first thought. Like others before them, they wandered hand-in-hand around the charming streets surrounding the Place de Tourny in central Bordeaux, stopping off for drinks in pavement cafes and enjoying bistro meals. Yet the couple who stayed on the third floor of the cramped anonymous ‘hideaway’ with white, unadorned walls were far from ordinary. Megan Stammers, left, leaves the Bordeaux airport after she sparked an international search when she went missing along with her math teacher . For this was the hotel where . 15-year-old schoolgirl Megan Stammers and her former maths teacher . Jeremy Forrest, 30, stayed the night after they fled Britain. Last night Megan was reunited with . her mother Danielle Wilson, while the French lawyer for Forrest, who had . been arrested on suspicion of child abduction, said his client was . ‘very disappointed by the brutal ending of his love story’. Looking back, as the hotel staff now . concede, there was perhaps something unusual about them. Not least, for . instance, the way Forrest left his companion waiting outside, standing . near a Chinese restaurant, her arms sheepishly folded, while he checked . in. He paid in cash – €61 up front. Explaining that his partner would join him shortly, he registered using an assumed name, Jack Grant. ‘He seemed calm and relaxed; but I never saw her close up,’ said a hotel worker. Their temporary bolthole was revealed as further extraordinary details of their disappearance began to be revealed yesterday. Forrest and Megan boarded a ferry from Dover to Calais nine days ago, sparking an international manhunt. Police are now investigating how the . passport belonging to mother-of-five Mrs Wilson came into her daughter’s . hands – and how the teenager managed to pass herself off as 37. A UK Border Agency spokesman said the . travel company used by the pair to get to France was responsible for . checking passport details, but it is unclear which operator the pair . used. They went to Paris but apparently . remained in the capital for only a matter of hours before dumping . Forrest’s black Ford Fiesta and boarding a high-speed TGV train at . Montparnasse station then travelling to Bordeaux, 400 miles away in the . south-west of the country. As Megan leaves France, the maths teacher accused of abducting her was said to be 'very disappointed by the brutal ending of his love story' Megan used her 37-year-old mother's Danielle Wilson's, passport to board the ferry, it was claimed . Once there, they were not required to . show their passports when they checked into the Choiseul, a two-star . hotel which stands half way down the Rue Huguerie in central Bordeaux. ‘It is not something we ask for,’ said a member of staff. The sparsely furnished blue-carpeted room Megan stayed in overlooks rooftops and a tiny courtyard. Above a dressing table, a small television is fixed to a wall. An old-fashioned phone sits on a bedside table. They stayed just one night and, then, . after repeatedly moving hotels, Forrest – who had been scrupulous until . this point about remaining anonymous – made a crucial error, one that . his lawyer said ended his ‘love story’ and dream of a new life. The teacher chose to look for work in . an English pub – the HMS Victory, staffed by English and Irish workers . and popular with the expat crowd, on Bordeaux’s main shopping street, . the bustling Rue Sainte Catherine. He was recognised by the manageress, . who claimed he said he was a freelance music journalist who had worked . for the NME. She suggested he return the following day. In the meantime . she contacted police and later positively identified him from other . photographs. ‘He also said he was in his 20s,’ said a bar worker. Among the qualifications he claimed . to have was a degree in journalism from Northampton University, and he . also said he had worked as a bartender at the Rising Sun pub in Eltham, . South-East London, and later as an human resources administrator for IPC . Media in London. No mention was made of his teaching career. He said that he was a keen writer and . musician doing freelance work for rock magazines Kerrang and Big . Cheese, and said he still did regular work for NME. Sussex Police officers, who had . already been alerted to the possibility that the couple were in . Bordeaux, flew to the city on Thursday as a trap was sprung. Police lay . in wait from early on Friday and detained Forrest as he strolled to the . HMS Victory with Megan along Rue Sainte Catherine at lunchtime. ‘It happened discreetly, with little fuss,’ said a police source. ‘Mr Forrest co-operated fully.’ Yesterday his French lawyer, Daniel . Lalane, said: ‘He was arrested when looking for work to extend his stay . in France a little longer in a country that is perhaps a little more . understanding. He is a charming, discreet, lovely man. He is not . depressed, just disappointed.’ After the arrest Megan was taken into . protective custody, and returned to Gatwick on a 3.15pm easyJet flight . yesterday for an emotional reunion with her family. Her mother left her semi-detached home in Eastbourne, East Sussex, with a police family liaison officer, shortly after 1pm. Megan and Jeremy were discovered walking through Bordeaux when police swooped in . Megan’s stepfather Martin Stammers . said he was ‘over the moon’. ‘I’m thrilled and overjoyed. The most . amazing thing is the joy I feel in here,’ he added, pointing to his . heart. ‘You can’t describe the feeling.’ Megan and Forrest fled to France 24 hours after the teacher was told he was due to be suspended. Staff at the Bishop Bell CofE School . in Eastbourne are believed to have alerted British police to their . concerns about the relationship between teacher and pupil. Despite this, the pair were able to . travel to France, and until yesterday the last confirmed sighting had . been CCTV footage of them arm-in-arm on the ferry. Mrs Wilson has always said that she . and Megan’s 43-year-old stepfather knew nothing about the UK authorities . being concerned about the teenager’s closeness to Forrest. French police piecing together their journey believe they then drove south from Calais to Paris. Their black Ford Fiesta is understood . to have been found in the French capital, where they are believed to . have been spotted by a British tourist last Sunday. Sighting: Sussex Police issued this picture of . the Ford Fiesta driven by Jeremy Forrest to Dover, with Megan Stammers . also inside . After vanishing last Thursday, police found the schoolgirl and maths teacher in Bordeaux, France . A French police source said: ‘They . dumped their car close to a mainline station and headed for Bordeaux – . clearly they knew the authorities were on to them. ‘They thought they could blend into day-to-day life in Bordeaux.’ Forrest, from Ringmer, near Lewes, . East Sussex, was due before a judge at a private hearing in Bordeaux . last night to be formally served with a European arrest warrant and . remanded in custody. He will appear at a public hearing in . Bordeaux’s Court of Appeal on Tuesday and his fast-track extradition . back to the UK is expected within days. Last night his lawyer said: ‘He has . agreed to return to the UK as soon as possible without the need for . protracted extradition proceedings.’ As he contemplates the possibility of . criminal charges, Forrest is being held with men facing trial for . murder and rape in a notoriously violent jail. He is in a shared cell in . the massively overcrowded Gradignan prison, on the outskirts of . Bordeaux. It is officially meant to hold around . 400 remand prisoners, but numbers regularly spiral towards the 1,000 . mark, meaning cell sharing and regular ‘lock downs’ as warders trying to . enforce discipline. Fights and attacks on inmates are . frequent, with up to half a dozen suicides a year prompting protests . from human rights groups. In 2001 a prisoner was murdered by his cellmate.

Back: After the arrest Megan Stammers (left) was taken into protective custody, and returned to London Gatwick on a 3.15pm easyJet flight yesterday from Bordeaux (right) for an emotional reunion with her family . Mr Forrest is still in love with Megan and wants to be extradited from France so he will be closer to her, his lawyer said today. The 30-year-old is currently being held in a remand prison after being arrested in Bordeaux on Friday. Megan flew back to the UK yesterday after more than a week on the run. Daniel Lalanne, his French lawyer, said: ‘We have discussed how he feels about being taken back to Britain and he will not contest it.’ ‘This is primarily because going home will take him back closer to the person he loves. ‘His only crime is to have fallen in love with a 15-year-old, without any recourse to violence or manipulation. Of course he is devastated and only wants to be reunited with Megan.’ Forrest will appear in court in Bordeaux on Tuesday for formal extradition proceedings. He confessed the couple had planned to 'lie low' in Bordeaux for another six months - when they could legally return to the UK as lovers when Megan turned 16. Hotel staff now concede there was something unusual about the couple. For instance, Mr Forrest left Megan waiting outside, her arms sheepishly folded, while he checked in, paying €61 cash up front. ‘He seemed calm and relaxed; but I never saw her close up,’ said a hotel worker. Police are now investigating how the passport belonging to mother-of-five Mrs Wilson came into her daughter’s hands – and how the teenager managed to pass herself off as 37 years old. They went to Paris but soon dumped Mr Forrest’s Ford Fiesta and boarded a TGV train at Montparnasse station then travelled to Bordeaux, 400 miles away in the south-west of the country. Once there, they were not required to show their passports when they checked into the Choiseul, a two-star hotel which stands half way down the Rue Huguerie in central Bordeaux. They stayed just one night and, then, after repeatedly moving hotels, Mr Forrest - who had been scrupulous about remaining anonymous - made the crucial error when applying for the bar job. On camera: CCTV footage of Megan Stammers and Jeremy Forrest . Earlier this year Mr Forrest had spent six days  in Los Angeles with 50 pupils and five other teachers from the Bishop Bell school. It was on that trip that pupils were reportedly shocked to see Mr Forrest holding hands with Megan as they sat together on the flight home. Further details have emerged about the group’s itinerary, which began on February 11 when they checked into the £100-a-night Sportsmen’s Lodge Hotel which, in Hollywood’s golden era, hosted stars such as Clark Gable, Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn. Megan was given Room 229, on the first floor, sharing with three friends. Mr Forrest was close by in Room 211 with another male teacher. The trip included a tour of Disneyland and Universal Studios, a visit to Warner Bros and Sony Studios, and a stroll along the Hollywood Walk of Fame. They visited the millionaires’ shopping playground of Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, walked on Venice Beach, and explored the legendary Sunset Strip. Staff at the Lodge remembered Forrest as friendly and capable but did not notice Megan among the other students.

Near miss: Sir Paul and wife Nancy Shevell at the launch of Mary McCartney's cookbook just hours before the incident . Sir Paul McCartney and his wife were just two feet away from disaster when the pilot of their helicopter became ‘disorientated’ in bad weather and plunged towards trees. They avoided a potentially fatal crash with just a split second to spare when the pilot dramatically lifted the chartered Sikorsky S-76C away from the rain-lashed tree tops. The drama happened as the aircraft, with the couple on board, attempted to land  at night on a helipad at their East Sussex estate. The helicopter eventually touched down safely after diverting to a nearby airport. It is understood that Sir Paul, 70, and his 52-year-old wife, Nancy Shevell – who have declined to comment about the incident – were unaware how close they came to crashing. The near miss is being investigated by the Department of Transport. The Mail on Sunday can reveal that the Air Accidents Investigation Branch has categorised the episode as a ‘serious incident’, which it defines as ‘involving circumstances indicating that an accident nearly occurred’. According to the AAIB report, the minimum reading from the helicopter’s altimeter – which measures height by  focusing on a fixed point – was ‘two feet’. It is understood the fixed point was the tree tops rather than the ground. In pulling hard away, the 55-year-old pilot was forced to put immense pressure on the engine, which can itself be dangerous. The report also reveals flying conditions that night included ‘low cloudbase, poor visibility and rain’. Despite this, the pilot pressed ahead and prepared to land on the former Beatle’s helipad, which is in the corner of a field encircled by woodland. It adds: ‘While manoeuvring, the commander became disorientated and the helicopter descended towards tops of trees in the forested area to the south and west of the landing site.’ The pilot then ‘executed a go-around’ or aborted landing. The £5 million nine-seater helicopter, which weighs 5.3 tons, was chartered from Air Harrods, which describes itself as the ‘leading London-based business aviation service provider’. The firm counts Tony Blair among its clients and charges around £3,000 an hour. Earlier in the evening, the couple had been to the Liberty department store in the West End for the launch of a vegetarian cookbook written by Sir Paul’s eldest daughter Mary. They took off from Battersea heliport in South London at 9.30pm, reaching East Sussex 25 minutes later. Luxury travel: Sir Paul and his wife were flying in a nine-seater Air Harrods helicopter worth £5million . Following the aborted landing, the pilot eventually landed safely after diverting to Lydd Airport in Kent, 15 miles from their home near Rye. The report also reveals that weeks after the May 3 incident, the flight data was examined using incorrect software. This meant Air Harrods was unaware the helicopter had exceeded its limitations and a ‘maintenance’ inspection was required. It prompted the AAIB – which makes no judgment on blame in accidents and  serious incidents – to issue a safety recommendation about the software. The report does not mention the helicopter’s speed at the time of the incident, although some experts suggested it may have been about 60mph. The Sikorsky’s maximum cruising speed is 178mph. Close call: The helipad on Sir Paul's East Sussex estate in the corner of a field surrounded by dense trees . Peter Norton, chief executive of the British Helicopter Association, last night described the incident as ‘alarming’. He said: ‘He [the pilot] was going to land and realised he wasn’t in control of the aircraft because of the weather conditions and visibility; he pulled in lots of power to climb away and correct the aircraft to its proper flightpath and missed whatever it was by two feet.’ The Air Harrods pilot thought to have been at the controls during the incident lives in Hertfordshire with his family. He told a reporter yesterday: ‘I can’t say anything.’ His company declined to say whether he faced disciplinary action. As well as executive travel, the S-76C twin-engine helicopter is used for search and rescue missions. On its website, Dawn Wyatt, Air Harrods’s operations manager, says: ‘The beauty of helicopter travel is that you really can be picked up from a suitable local site, possibly your own garden, if it is big enough. This negates the need for airports and all the associated hassle they entail.’ Elsewhere, the website says: ‘Throughout the past ten years, the Air Harrods fleet has been constantly updated to ensure that our customers have the very best and latest machines available; today we have the finest examples of VIP helicopters. ‘Air Harrods’s future looks set to continue the long established statement of quality, safety, comfort and style.’ A spokesman for Air Harrods said: ‘Harrods Aviation can confirm that an incident took place on May 3 involving an Air Harrods helicopter. ‘We are working in full cooperation with the AAIB which are currently investigating the incident.’ Last night Sir Paul’s spokesman said: ‘Paul has been spoken to. It has been put to him, everything. It’s a no comment.’","Sir Paul and his wife were flying in a £5million 9-seater Air Harrods helicopter .

South African police say they have foiled a plot to bomb a conference attended by President Jacob Zuma and dozens of top government officials. Four men aged between 40 and 50 were arrested on Sunday it has today been confirmed. A police spokesman said there was evidence they were planning acts around the country and not just at the African National Congress (ANC) meeting in the central city of Bloemfontein. South African President Jacob Zuma, pictured here with the Queen during a ceremonial welcome, is believed to have been a target in a suspected bomb plot . Four men aged between 40 and 50 were arrested on Sunday it has today been confirmed. Zuma, is pictured here with former Prime Minister Gordon Brown . The vast majority of South Africa's whites accepted the ANC's victory in the 1994 election that brought Nelson Mandela to power and ended decades of white-minority rule. However, a tiny handful continues to oppose the historic settlement. Police spokesman Billy Jones said: 'Their acts are widespread. We arrested them in different provinces.' ANC spokesman Keith Khoza said preliminary information suggested the men were planning to bomb the marquee where Zuma and 4,500 delegates are holding a five-day meeting to chose the ANC's leadership for the next five years. He said: 'This would have been an act of terrorism that South Africa can ill afford.' The Federal Freedom Party (FFP), a fringe group fighting for self-determination for the white Afrikaner minority, confirmed two of those arrested were FFP members but denied any role in the suspected plot. 'We were not involved and do not associate ourselves with their actions,' FFP national secretary Francois Cloete said. In July, a former university lecturer was found guilty of orchestrating a 2002 plot to overthrow the ANC and assassinate Mandela - now 94 and receiving treatment in a Pretoria hospital for a lung infection. There was a heavy security presence at the Bloemfontein meeting and the few vehicles being allowed onto the university campus hosting the event were being searched by police and sniffer dogs. The conference is set to give Zuma a second mandate to lead the party and - given the ANC's dominance at the ballot box - another five-year term in 2014 as president of Africa's biggest economy. Zuma's nomination for the post of party leader was met by wild cheers from delegates, in marked contrast to the muted applause and occasional whistle that greeted his only challenger, Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe. In July, a former university lecturer was found guilty of orchestrating a 2002 plot to overthrow the ANC and assassinate Mandela now 94 and receiving treatment in a Pretoria hospital for a lung infection . Motlanthe withdrew from the race to become Zuma's number two, virtually handing the position to former union leader Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa's second-richest black businessman who is returning to politics after a decade absence. Ramaphosa supporters said they were confident of victory when results of the internal election are announced on Tuesday. 'The numbers are in our favour and we are going for it,' said one backer said. 'It's almost a done deal. Cyril is going to be our next deputy president.' The ascension of Ramaphosa to a top ANC position is likely to be seen as a pro-business move by a party still deeply rooted in socialism, and may help assuage the fears of the ratings agencies that have recently downgraded South Africa. Zuma's administration has been criticised for failing to overhaul a rigid labour market or fix a broken education system that is eroding the long-term competitiveness of Africa's biggest economy. There are also concerns the ANC might push for new taxes for mining firms to help the government finance welfare spending for the millions of blacks who have seen few economic gains since the end of apartheid. However, Deputy Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene said the government would not be 'reckless' in implementing new taxes. He also accused the ratings agencies of political meddling. 'There has actually been some level of unfairness because if you look at what was coming out of the ratings agencies, it was somewhat of an attempt to influence the outcome of the conference,' he told a business forum on the sidelines of the ANC meeting.","Four arrested for suspected bomb conspiracy .

A 75-year-old patient has died after an ambulance taking her to hospital slipped off the road on suspected black ice and crashed into a deep dyke. The woman was being taken to the Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, Lincs, when the vehicle crashed just before 3am today. Lincolnshire Police said the ambulance left the A16 at Sibsey just three miles from the hospital. It was not using its blue lights or sirens when it crashed and was travelling at normal road speed. Crash: The ambulance came off the A16 in Lincolnshire and dropped into a 15ft-high irrigation ditch .

Emergency service: The ambulance had been taking the patient to hospital in Boston when it left the road . 'If there was freezing rain or ice on the road in the middle of the night then it would be easy to do. It looks as though the ambulance's back end has just slipped off as they went around the corner.' Another neighbour added: 'We heard all the noise about 3.30am and then when it got light we could see the ambulance in the ditch from our house. It is a wonder they were not all killed as it is such a deep ditch. 'It was also lucky that the ambulance did not go upside down in to the water, a lot of the ditches are a lot fuller than the one it went into.'

"By . Ian Gallagher . PUBLISHED: . 16:07 EST, 27 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:49 EST, 28 October 2012 . Saddam Hussain gave £840,000 to the family of the British engineer who was murdered with his wife in the Alps, it was claimed last night. The former Iraqi dictator is said to have deposited the sum in a Swiss bank account in the name of Saad Al-Hilli’s father. The claim, which apparently originated with German intelligence, adds a sensational twist to the baffling case. Cash deposit: Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, left, is said to have deposited £840,000 into the bank account of murdered Saad Al-Hilli's (pictured right) father Kadhim . Murder scene: Saad al-Hilli, his wife, Iqbal, and his mother-in-law were all killed in an isolated lay-by near Lake Annecy in Eastern France . Mr Al-Hilli, 50, from Surrey was killed along with his wife Iqbal, 47, his mother-in-law and a French cyclist last month in an attack that left his seven-year-old daughter, Zainab, badly injured, and her four-year-old sister Zeena deeply traumatised. Mr Al-Hilli’s father Kadhim was once close to Saddam’s Ba’ath Party, but fell foul of the tyrant in the Seventies, and fled Iraq for Britain. The scene of the September 5 massacre – an isolated lay-by near Lake Annecy in Eastern France – is only an hour’s drive from Geneva where the money was deposited. Swiss prosecutor Dario Zanni believes the family may have been returning from there when  ambushed. Tragedy: How the killings were reported at the time of the massacre . It raises the possibility that Mr Al-Hilli had managed to gain access to the account, which is thought to have remained in his father’s name, and that this was known to his killer. The story was reported in the respected French newspaper Le Monde. It said that a French police source had revealed that the money’s source had been discovered by German intelligence agency BND. The agency’s operatives routinely monitored the flow of cash to and from Baghdad as Germany did more business with the Saddam regime than any other country. An intelligence source in Munich said last night: ‘They know the money trail, and they know how to follow it. They have spent decades monitoring money transactions between the West and Iraq. The BND is the first port of call in such circumstances.’ The BND said they had no comment on the report, saying: ‘We do not comment on operations.’ The Le Monde story was published under the headline: ‘The potential links between the Al-Hillis and Saddam Hussein.’ It said: ‘According to a French police source, the German secret service informed the gendarmerie’s anti-terrorist branch that there were links between the Al-Hilli family and Saddam Hussein’s fortune. ‘The tensions began after Saad Al-Hilli’s father [Kadhim] was struck off the list of beneficiaries of the former Iraqi dictator.’ It has always been suggested that Kadhim’s multi-million pound legacy – he died last year – led to conflict between Saad, who lived in Claygate, Surrey, and his brother Zaid who lives in nearby Chessington. However Zaid strongly denies there was any such feud. Close ties: Mr Al-Hilli's father Kadhim is believed to have been close to Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath Party but later fled for the UK . Fall out: But Kadhim Al-Hilli fell out with Saddam in the seventies . Shortly after his murder, it emerged that Saad Al-Hilli had put a block on his father’s will, which effectively stopped his brother from inheriting his share until ‘unknown’ disputes were resolved. But Le Monde says it was the money in the Swiss bank account – not the rest of the legacy – that may have caused friction between the two brothers. Swiss investigators discovered the . secret account earlier this month, but according to Le Monde they didn’t . make the link to Iraq. Mystery: It is still unknown why Saad Al-Hilli, his wife and 77-year-old Swedish mother-in-law were killed . Specialist police were last week questioning . Geneva-based bankers about the Al-Hillis’ assets, while financial . records in countries including America have also been requested. Kadhim, a former factory owner, left Baghdad in the late Seventies with his wife, Fasiha, and two boys, after allegedly falling foul of the Ba’ath Party. The family settled in Pimlico, Central London, later moving to Surrey. Another theory is that Kadhim never . fell out with the Ba’ath Party at all – and that he was simply managing . many accounts for Saddam behind this smokescreen. Shortly . before the dictator was executed in 2006, it was revealed that he . withdraw around £620 million from the Iraqi central bank in 2003, which . he had begun to hide around the world. The assets would have been added . to millions already deposited in accounts in other countries – mainly . through Iraqis who had moved abroad. Saddam is known to have . concentrated large amounts in Switzerland and France, where he had at . least two homes and moored a £17 million yacht. If . Saad Al-Hilli was party to this secret information – and indeed the . location of the hidden millions – then he would have been an obvious . target for an attack. Eric . Maillaud, the Annecy prosecutor leading the inquiry into the quadruple . killing, said he had ‘not yet been informed’ about the intelligence from . Germany. However he confirmed that Mr Al-Hilli’s financial affairs and his background in Iraq were at the top of subjects being investigated. Another theory previously mooted was that Mr Al-Hilli was targeted by Iranian spies desperate to get their hands on high-resolution satellite technology. The Briton was an expert in that field, and worked for Surrey Satellite Technology in Guildford. The family left their Europa campsite after two nights and moved to the La Solitude du Lac campsite, which overlooks Lake Annecy . Peaceful spot: Walkers on the remote 3 km track to the scene of the attack outside the village of Chevaline where the Al-Hillis and Sylvain Mollier were murdered . Emmanuel Ludot, a French lawyer who defended Saddam Hussein following his capture, admitted that the deposed regime still had funds in Swiss accounts, but said the notion of a ‘hidden fortune’ was fantasy. Zaid Al-Hilli has been questioned by police, but is being treated solely as a witness after denying any involvement in the slaughter. When asked about the Le Monde story, Zaid told The Mail on Sunday last night: ‘It’s all rubbish, they can speculate until they’re blue in the face to be honest with you.’ Further asked if his father had ever mentioned links to Saddam, he said: ‘We have no links with that regime. We live outside [Iraq]  because of that regime, that’s why we have been here for 41 years.’ In a separate development, it emerged yesterday that Mr Al-Hilli made a desperate attempt to drive his family to safety under a hail of bullets, but his car got stuck on a verge. The gunmen then moved in to finish them off at close range. Investigators believe the killer was alone and used only one weapon, a pistol common in the Swiss army in the Twenties and Thirties. Grief: Family friends outside the Al-Hilli home in Claygate, Surrey, soon after the murders were reported . Concern: The Al-Hilli's home in Claygate, Surrey. Speculation still surrounds the motive for the shootings in which three members of the family died . Prayers: Saad Al-Hilli, 50, his wife Iqbal, 47, and her 74-year-old mother Suhaila Al-Allaf, were laid to rest in the same grave in Surrey . Zainab told police she and her father were outside the car when the shooting started. Unable to get her into the car, he then attempted to escape in the vehicle with the rest of the family under fire. However, as he backed up to get away, the car became stuck on an embankment, leaving the family at the mercy of the killer who then shot the three adults, including Mr Al-Hilli’s mother-in-law Suhaila Al-Allaf in the head. While it is unclear when cyclist Sylvain Mollier was killed, it appears his body was hit by the Al-Hillis’ car during the attempted escape. After running out of ammunition, the killer pistol-whipped the older girl in the face, but was apparently interrupted and fled  the scene.

Guatemalan officials have begun investigating seven arrests and two reported deaths in the Rio Grande Valley after a Texas state trooper opened fire on a speeding vehicle filled with suspected illegal immigrants on Thursday. The Texas Department of Public Safety sharpshooter was trying to disable the red pickup truck as it was driving near the town of La Joya, suspecting that the truck was being used to smuggle drugs, authorities said. The unnamed trooper has been placed on administrative leave, a standard practice for officers involved in fatal shootings. Caught: A red pick up truck is moved from the scene of an incident after a chase between Texas State troopers and suspected drug smugglers near La Joya, Texas. The pickup truck was first encountered Thursday by state game wardens who said the truck appeared to be a carrying a ""typical covered drug load"" on its bed and was traveling at reckless speeds. When the driver refused to stop, the game wardens radioed for help, and a state police helicopter with the sharpshooter on board was the first to respond, according to a Texas Parks and Wildlife Department spokesman. After the officer fired shots at the truck, just north of the Mexican border, the driver stopped. Seven Guatemalans were arrested on the scene, and no drugs were found. The nationalities of the dead victims and of an eighth person arrested after the incident occurred have not yet been released. Shooting Location: Just north of La Joya, Texas . Guatemala's deputy minister of foreign relations, Rita Claverie, said her government will demand an explanation from the U.S. ""This incident surprises us because we had never seen force being used from a helicopter,"" Claverie said. Humberto Palacios, head of protection and investigations at the Guatemalan consulate in McAllen, said the consulate was looking into the matter and would ask authorities to establish what happened. Troopers are regularly involved in high-speed pursuits near the Mexican border, often chasing drug smugglers between the two countries. In recent years, Texas state police have increased their presence in the border region, deploying more agents, more helicopters and more boats to patrol the Rio Grande Valley. Texas Department of Public Safety Director Stephen McCraw has said state police were pushed into that role because the federal government's efforts to secure the border have been insufficient.","A Texas state trooper fired at a speeding truck filled with suspected illegal immigrants .

The press watchdog has said it would be 'inappropriate' to open an investigation into the Sun’s publication of nude photos of Prince Harry. The Press Complaints Commission (PCC) said it was in touch with Harry’s representatives, who had not yet made a formal complaint, and that any investigation without consent could ‘pose an intrusion’ in itself.

The UK’s biggest selling daily newspaper argued that the photos taken by party-goers with the knowledge of police protection officers were an issue of press freedom and in the public interest. St James’s Palace appealed to British newspapers not to run the pictures after they were originally published on American celebrity gossip website TMZ. Prince Charles’s solicitors, Harbottle and Lewis, wrote to the PCC asking them to make the press 'fully aware' it believed there was no public interest in newspapers publishing the photographs and that to do so would be a 'clear breach' of media regulations. The PCC had in turn warned that publication could breach the editor’s code of practice on privacy grounds.

A beautiful Indian princess, she  sacrificed her life for Britain as a  wartime secret agent. With astonishing courage, Noor Inayat Khan evaded the Gestapo before being betrayed, tortured and, after refusing to reveal any information, executed at Dachau concentration camp. Her last word as the firing squad raised their weapons on September 13, 1944, was 'liberté'. Scroll down for video . Noor Inayat Khan wartime heroine who had a statue to her unveiled by the Princess Royal in London today . Yesterday, seven decades after her death aged 30, a statue to the forgotten heroine was unveiled in London by the Princess Royal. The bronze bust commemorating Britain’s only female Muslim war heroine is the first stand-alone memorial to an Asian woman in the UK. It stands in Gordon Square near the house where Noor lived and from where she left on her last mission, unable to tell her mother she might never return. Princess Anne said  stories such as Noor’s are ‘remarkable in their own right’ but have a real connection to make with the modern age through their ‘multi-cultural aspect’. She hoped the statue will 'remind people to ask: Who was she? Why is she here? And what can we achieve in her memory?' Noor had a degree in child psychology, played sitar, and wrote short stories for children . The statue of Noor Inayat Khan was made by London artist Karen Newman . Noor was part of an elite band of women in the Special Operations Executive (SOE) and the first woman radio operator to be flown into occupied France to aid the Resistance. Born in Moscow to an Indian father and an American mother, Noor was a descendant of Tipu Sultan, the 18th century ruler of Mysore. The family lived in London, moving to Paris when Noor was six. She studied the harp, gained a degree in child psychology and wrote children’s stories. When Paris fell to the Nazis in 1940, she returned to London and volunteered for the Women’s Auxiliary Air Force. Recruited by the SOE in 1942, she was sent to Paris in June 1943 with the codename Madeleine. Many members of the network  were soon arrested, but Noor chose  to remain in France, trying to send messages back to London while  avoiding capture. The Princess Royal unveiled the statue today at Gordons Square in London . Princess Anne said stories such as Noor's are 'remarkable in their own . right' but have a real connection to make with the modern age through . their 'multi-cultural aspect' Herione: Noor was executed in Dachau for refusing to give up state secrets . That October she was betrayed by a Frenchwoman and arrested by the Gestapo. She was kept in chains and in solitary confinement. Her captors kicked and interrogated her but she revealed nothing. When posthumously awarded the George Cross, Britain’s highest civilian decoration, for her gallantry in 1949, the citation read: 'She refused to abandon what had become the principal and most dangerous post in France, although given the opportunity to return to England, because she did not wish to leave her French comrades without communications.' Noor was one of only three women in the SOE to be awarded the medal. The other two – Violette Szabo and Odette Hallowes – have been more widely known and celebrated until now. Campaigners spent years raising £60,000 for Noor’s statue, by London-based artist Karen Newman, from public donations and enlisted the support of politicians including David Cameron, who said it was ‘impossible not to be moved’ by her bravery. Shrabani Basu who wrote a biography of Noor in 2006 called 'Spy Princess' and spearheaded the campaign to get her formally recognised, said: 'I . realised how much Noor's story had touched ordinary people, especially . the young. 'I felt it was all the more important to remember Noor's message, her ideals and her courage in the troubled times we live in.' Noor's brother Hidayat Inayat Khan, . 95, was unable to travel from his home in The Hague, Netherlands, to . attend the ceremony due to old age but said in a message read by his . grandson Omar: . Nazi concentration camp Dachau, where Noor was shot after being tortured and imprisoned by the Gestapo . 'May the inhuman suffering of all those - who like my dear sister perished under the brutal cruelty of the oppressor - not be in vain.' Her cousin Mahmood Khan Youskine, 84, who spent holidays with her in France as a child, did make it and said: 'I remember her as a very refined girl who believed in freedom as a spiritual condition. 'Later I think she decided freedom had to be a political and social experience too. 'Sometimes it can take time to gain clarity on the past, but I appreciate it enormously that she is now being given recognition in the heart of London.' Veterans of both the SOE and WAAF including Irene Warner, 91, who trained with Noor, were among the 300 throng. She remembered her as 'quiet and shy but very nice' and said she 'certainly deserves recognition'. General Sir David Richards, the Chief of Defence Staff, said in a message in the programme: 'We owe our freedom to women like Noor Inayat Khan.' After the unveiling, a bugler played the Last Post before a minute's silence was observed. Noor was also posthumously awarded France's Croix se Guerre after the war. A film of her life is planned for release next year on the centenary of her birth.","Noor Inayat Khan was one of Churchill's elite band of women spies .

More recently, he had his eye on buying a Mercedes-Benz CL63 AMG, a luxury car with a base price of $153,000. Friends say he worked as a party and nightclub promoter. At clubs he threw around large chunks of money on expensive booze and private tables - partying with actors and athletes. He once bragged about getting beaten up by the bodyguards for the R&B prince Usher, the Post reports.

NYPD shows the gunman walking up behind Woodard and shooting him once . him the back of the head. Connected: Sandra Wellington, Woodard's mother, is a successful Los Angeles businesswoman . A source told the Post that Woodard could have been lured to the spot by a text message or a phone call. He is believed to have walked past . the getaway car on West 58th Street and the driver pointed him out to . the gunman, the source said. The victim then reversed direction and walked . back towards his assailant after receiving a text message or . call, and the shooter then crept behind him, the source . said. The shooter didn't pause or panic as . he turned and left Woodward to die in a pool of his own blood - he . simply got into a waiting Lincoln MKX getaway car and fled the scene. Police found the car, which was a rental, in Queens on Wednesday and talked to the couple who had rented it. The . Post reports that detectives don't believe the two were in the vehicle . at the time of the shooting, but may have loaned it to the assassins. Woodard . grew up in privilege in Los Angeles. His mother, Sandra Wellington owns . the once-successful United International Mortgage. Other family members . are well-connected lawyers and entrepreneurs, the New York Times reports. Mrs . Wellington is married to the ex-boyfriend of former soap star Tonya . Pinkins, who claims the family is involved in criminal business . dealings. Ms Pinkins, who starred in 'All My . Child' and won a Tony award for 'Jelly's Last Jam,' says the murder could be connected to Mrs Wellington, according to Showbiz 411. Star power: Woodard once claimed he was involved . in a scuffle with Usher's bodyguards. His mother, Sandra Wellington has . been in a long-running dispute with Tonya Pinkins (right), who starred . in 'All My Children' 'We’ve been waiting for something like this,' she told the gossip site. Pinkins has been involved in a long-running dispute with Mrs Wellington and her husband Rod, the father of Ms Pinkins' daughter. Police on Tuesday refused to comment on . whether they are investigating Woodard's mother's business in connection . with the shooting. Ms Wellington could not be reached for comment on the allegations Wednesday night. Woodard attended the private Campbell Hall high school, where he was a star basketball player. He was a member of the exclusive invitation-only Jack and Jill of America society, which caters to upper-class black families. Family: Woodard, seen here with his five-year-old daughter, came from a wealthy family - but continued his hard-partying lifestyle until his death . For college, he went to Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, a $55,000-per-year private school. Family members say he was a second-year law student at the University of West Los Angeles School of Law, another private school. In college, he drove a Range Rover, friends told the Times. More recently, he had his eye on buying a Mercedes-Benz CL63 AMG, a luxury car with a base price of $153,000. Friends say he worked as a party and nightclub promoter. At clubs he threw around large chunks of money on expensive booze and private tables - partying with actors and athletes. He once bragged about getting beaten up by the bodyguards for the R&B prince Usher, the Post reports. Sadet Kolo, 36, who was skateboarding near the victim told the New York Daily News: 'It came out of nowhere. I turned around and saw a man next to me, on the ground. I called 911 and told him ""Hang on. Help is on the way"" Intent: The gunman is seen in khaki pants and a dark top loitering next to the grey car as he waits for his victim to come walking down the street . Woodards neighbors often complained about the noise from his raucous parties. However, . beneath the seemingly charmed life, friends say, Woodard has a darker . side. He continued to party hard into his 30s, even as his friends began . to settle down. Woodard also has a five-year-old daughter. Woodard also had a lengthy criminal record - at least 20 arrests. He . was busted several times for stealing from upscale grocery stores - . including in 2009 when he was arrested for robbery after struggling with . a guard. He also had cocaine arrests. In . the summer, Mrs Wellington's company, United International Mortgage, . had its lending power revoked by California regulators. The company is . also the target of numerous lawsuits alleging fraud and breach of . contract. Friends say Woodard had a girlfriend in New York, but no one knows why he was visiting the city. One friend told the Times, 'He lived a little Batman-ish - a little secretive.'

Iraqi intelligence officers are investigating the assassination of a British engineer and his family in the French Alps, including his links to Saddam Hussein and an alleged fortune in cash hidden in a Swiss bank account. Saad al-Hilli, 50, wife Ikbal, 47, and her mother Suhaila, 74, were gunned down in their car execution-style while seemingly taking a camping holiday in the Alps. Oldest daughter Zainab, seven, was shot in the shoulder, while Zeena, four, only survived by hiding underneath her mother’s skirt in the back of the family's BMW estate car. Saad Al-Hilli (left), was murdered in a suspected assassination while on holiday with his family in France. Iraqi police are now investigating his links to former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein (right) pictured in 1991 . Downtown Baghdad: Mr al-Hilli returned to Iraq in 2010, when he was allegedly badly beaten up . But as yet investigations have drawn a . blank prompting the French team to travel to Iraq to hand dozens of pages on Mr al-Hilli . to local Intelligence officers in the hope they can uncover a motive for the killings. Mr al-Hilli returned to Iraq in 2010, . ostensibly to take control of the family home and a poultry business they . managed before leaving the country in the late 1960s. But during his time there he was allegedly badly beaten up and was said to have returned to the UK traumatised from the experience. Then there is also the question of an estimated £800,000 left by Saad’s father Kadhim in a Swiss bank account. There have been reports that  his late . father, Kadhim, was once close to Saddam's Ba'ath Party  but fell foul . of the tyrant in the Seventies, and fled Iraq for Britain. Alternatively, it has been suggested . this was a smokescreen and that Kadhim's true role was to manage secret . accounts for the regime. Emails and mobile phone calls . intercepted by Swiss intelligence agency FIS and passed to their German . counterparts suggest that Saad Al-Hilli may have been about to access . the money, or part of it, shortly before he was killed. Lake Annecy, where the family were staying is a short drive to the Swiss border and over to Geneva. Aerial photo of the car at the murder scene in the forrest near Chevaline and Lake Annecy in the French Alps . Another account, said to contain some . £16 million in illegal kickbacks to Saddam Hussein's regime, was set up . in the tax haven of Liechtenstein. This was one of dozens of accounts the Saddam regime used to hide money illegally skkimmed from the UN Oil for Food programme. While sketchy, the claims raise . questions about whether the killers knew or suspected Mr Al-Hilli had . access to large deposits of cash. A source told the Daily Mirror: 'For . this murder to take place just over the Swiss border, so close to where . that money rested untouched for so many years, cannot be disregarded as a . strange coincidence,” the inquiry source continued. 'In total there are more than 2,000 dossiers to study, many focussing on the family’s Iraqi background. 'That is why this is such an extraordinarily complex case and why it could take years of careful police work to solve it.' An earlier theory maintained that the . cyclist Mr Mollier, 45, was in fact the intended target due to his job . at a metal plant supplying materials to the nuclear fuel industry . There had been some speculation that . the Israeli secret service Mossad believed Mr Mollier could have been . selling nuclear secrets and was monitoring his emails. Another theory is that the killings were the work of a racist psychopath who had targetted the family at random.","Saad al-Hilli, 50, wife Ikbal, 47, and .

Social workers failed to respond to a call about possible abuse at the home of seven-year-old Roderick ‘RJ’ Arrington just hours before he was beaten to death, a report has claimed. Officials with the Clark County School District said they placed a call to the child welfare hotline over concerns that Arrington was being abused at home but that social workers never responded to the school. Instead, Arrington was allowed to go home, where later that night he is believed to have been severely beaten by his mother and stepfather and put into a coma from which he would not recover earlier this month. Scroll down for video . Beaten to death for not reading the Bible: Roderick Arrington, seven, was covered in bruises and open wounds when he was brought unconscious to hospital in Las Vegas where he later died . School officials and members of the county’s Department of Family Services are now trying to determine whether more could have been done to save Arrington’s life, according to the Las Vegas Journal-Review. It appears that faculty at Roudy Elementary, where Arrington attended, were clued into possible abuse after the boy appeared uncomfortable sitting in his chair and told his teacher that he had been spanked by his parents. The school then followed its policy of alerting child welfare agents of any case where abuse may be involved. The Department of Family Services admitted that it received a call from the school on Nov. 28 and said in a statement that it is ‘conducting a complete review and investigation into this matter.’ ‘That investigation will include a review of all policies and procedures related to the hotline and CPS and will consider whether those policies and procedures were appropriately followed in Roderick's case,’ the statement read. ‘No child should ever have to suffer the way Roderick did and the loss of any child's life is tragic.’ Facing murder charges: The boy's stepfather Markiece Palmer, 34, and his mother Dina Palmer, 27, admitted repeated beating the boy with a belt and paddle .

Markiece Palmer, 34, and Dina Palmer, . 27, were charged with murder along with other counts of child . abuse and neglect. After the beating, Roderick . Arrington, seven, was taken to University Medical Center in Las Vegas unconscious and with massive brain swelling. The . arrest report details extensive injuries, including bruising over .

Arrington died the following . day. Markiece Palmer told police he had . spanked the child with a belt for lying about reading a Bible verse and failing to . finish his homework. He said the boy then 'ran up on him' and attempted to hit him, at which he grabbed the boy and shook him. Palmer said the boy then ran downstairs and slipped, hitting his head on the floor. After the fall, Palmer said he gave the boy a bath and put cocoa butter on his wounds. When the little boy was found unresponsive the next morning, Dina Palmer called her pastor who advised her to dial 911. Dina Palmer told police that she had repeatedly hit her son with a paddle and belt last month, what she described as 'whoopins'. The couple admitted to police that they regularly beat the child for not reading the Bible or finishing his homework.","Records show that officials at the boy's school called social services about possible abuse the day he was beaten to death .

A pensioner, 82, who drove the wrong way on a motorway after missing his turn-off, killed himself and another driver in a 100mph head-on crash. Cyril Titcombe was driving his wife Sheila home from Bristol airport after a holiday in Ibiza, when he did a U-turn on the M4 and started travelling west along the eastbound carriageway before he collided with an oncoming car halfway between junction 14 at Hungerford and 13 at Newbury on July 7. Mr Titcombe was killed instantly while the other driver, Tunay Guillym, 48, who was travelling 70 to 80 mph in the fast lane at the time of the collision, was rushed to John Radcliffe Hospital but was later pronounced dead. Deadly U-turn: Cyril Titcombe, 82, missed his turn off and so did a U-turn on the M4 and started travelling west along the eastbound carriageway when he collided with an oncoming car near Newbury (pictured) Mrs Titcombe was knocked unconscious but survived the horrific crash with just a broken arm. In a statement read at the double inquest at Newbury, Berkshire, she told how the couple had been driving their Mazda 323 from Bristol airport to their home in Swindon, Wiltshire. The couple had made the journey many times for the annual holiday to the Spanish holiday island, where they had been for the last 29 years, but usually travelled back during the day. This time however they had to drive home at night after their flights were changed, landing at Bristol at around 9.30pm. She said that she had noticed her husband had missed the junction as he travelled along the M4. Mrs Titcombe said: ‘I said to Cyril “where are you going?” I told him to find somewhere to turn around. ‘He said he was and we carried on driving for 10 minutes. I was very tired and nodding off.’ Mrs Titcombe said she then saw a turn-off and the couple came off the motorway to turn around. She said: ‘The next thing I remember was a really loud bang, I realised we had been hit by a car. ‘I said to Cyril “what have you done?”’ He was pushed to my side of the car. ‘I think I was knocked out and when I came around there was glass smashing everywhere and I heard a noise like cutting, maybe it was me being cut out (by the fire brigade).’ 'I said to Cyril ""where are you going?"" I told him to find somewhere to turn around.' Crash investigator Tony Reading told the coroner that a post mortem examination showed that both men died as a result of injuries sustained in the crash, although Mr Reading felt that Mr Guillym, who also lived in Swindon and was driving a Volkswagen Passat, could have survived if he was wearing a seatbelt. He said: ‘Mrs Titcombe was subjected to the same level of force. She is a lot older and less fit than a 48-year-old man and it’s my feeling that the injury would have been a lot less. ‘I’m not saying he would have survived but he stood a better chance of surviving.’ Mr Reading said he thought Mr Titcombe’s car was travelling between 10 and 60mph, while Mr Guillym’s was going at 70 to 80mph at the time of the crash, although he did not think that the damage was indicative of a 130mph impact. Mr Titcombe would have only had to travel a further five miles to leave the motorway safely. Mr Reading said that although police had been told that Mr Titcombe’s car was driving in the wrong direction, there would have been little that officers could have done to stop him. He said: ‘You wouldn’t have a police car go on the wrong carriageway. If you came across this you would stay in your own carriageway and do all you could to signal to him to pull over and stop, or alert other traffic. ‘It’s a nightmare scenario when you get a vehicle travelling the wrong way on a motorway.’ The inquest was told that Mr Titcombe had been concerned about his poor memory prior to the crash. Accidental deaths: Mr Titcombe died instantly after colliding with Tunay Guillym's car. He was rushed to John Radcliffe Hospital (pictured) but was later pronounced dead . He had visited his doctor about it and was prescribed treatment for hyperthyroidism, which was thought to have been causing the problems. Michael Burgess, assistant deputy coroner for Berkshire, recorded a verdict of accidental death for both men Mr Titcombe drove the wrong way down the road. He said: ‘It is impossible to know the speeds but an estimate in excess of 100mph is probably correct. ‘Both received injuries, Mr Titcombe dying at the scene, Mr Guillym dying subsequently at the John Radcliffe hospital, to where he had been moved. ‘Mr Titcombe entered onto the motorway clearly by accident.’ HGV driver Steven Daly said that he saw a car, thought to have been Mr Titcombe’s, perform a U-turn. He had been delivering newspapers from Newport, South Wales to Didcot, Oxfordshire, when he saw the car slow down in front of him. He said: ‘I wondered whether he got confused, thinking that was a turn-off. ‘I could see he stopped in the first lane, I’m approaching, slowing down and I thought this was strange and should I pull over or overtake but before I could make my mind up the car did a u-turn and went up the eastbound carriageway in the third lane.’ Another driver, Benjamin Smith, said he alerted the emergency services after spotting the car travelling in the wrong direction on the quiet motorway. He said: ‘My wife saw a car coming towards us in the first lane, going in the opposite direction.’ Russell Thirkettle had also been driving on the M4 when he was overtaken by Mr Guillym’s car, which he thought was travelling at 80 to 85mph. He said: ‘I could see the car that past me was about 100 metres in front. There was a glimmer of brake lights and the car inclined violently. ‘He swerved to his right, then the impact. It all happened within a fraction of a second. ‘He didn’t have time to put the brakes on, there was an explosive collision. ‘I had the windows up and the radio on, it was deafening from 100 metres back.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Cyril Titcombe missed his turn off and did a U-turn and started travelling west along the eastbound carriageway of the M4 .

'I saw the train hit him. I heard his bones crack,' he said. Later her turned himself in because he 'had no choice.' He hopes he can get a plea deal for 7 1/2 years to life if he agrees to a manslaughter charge. And he thinks he'll have a better stay in prison if he can see the Han's wife. 'I just want to see her face-to-face and say, ‘I'm sorry,’' he said. 'It would make things easier for me in here.' His family buried him Thursday. A devout Muslim, Davis says he's a good person who prays five times a day as well as going to mosque. 'I've been praying every hour,' he said. 'God was testing me. I failed that test.' Davis was refused . bail pending a second court appearance on December 11, Manhattan . Criminal Court Judge Lynn Kottler said at a hearing yesterday. He was also charged one count of second degree murder with depraved indifference, . The incident at 49th Street station . was captured in dramatic photographs of the train bearing down on the . victim by a freelance photographer. Mr Han can be seen trying to clamber back onto the platform as the train approaches but he was no one on the platform tried to assist him. The incident has led to soul searching in New York and raised questions about why nobody rushed to the victim's aid. Amateur video taken at the scene showed Davis and Han arguing moments before Han was shoved.

Manhattan prosecutor James Lin said at the hearing that Davis 'has admitted to lifting [the victim] off . his feet and pushing off the wall behind him to add more force' to the . fatal thrust. The previous day, Mr Han's family spoke of their 'disbelief' over his death. At an emotional press conference his . daughter Ashley and widow Serim battled through tears describing how . they are haunted that no one tried to save their loved one. Student Ashley, 20, said: 'My dad was . always someone who wanted to pursue the American dream. He really . enforced my education and he was just always there for me. It's just . devastating that he's gone and I'm still in disbelief.' When asked about her feelings that no . one tried to help her father, Ashley said: 'What's done is done. The . thought of someone helping him up in a matter of seconds would have been . great.' Speaking softly in Korean with her head bowed, Mrs Han, who was married to her husband for more than 22 years, thanked supporters and asked the media for privacy. She said: 'We are now grieving because we've lost a husband and a father.' Grisly death: 58-year-old Ki Suk Han was killed by a subway train after being pushed into its path in Times Square on Monday . Photographer R.Umar Abbasi, who took pictures of Mr Han's last moments, said he was too far away to help during an interview with the Today Show . Meanwhile the news photographer whose . pictures of Mr Han in the path of the train unleashed a maelstrom of . criticism said he was too far from the victim to offer help. R. Umar Abbasi, a freelance . photographer for the tabloid New York Post, said he rapidly shot dozens . of frames so that his flash might alert the motorman and that he himself . was too far away to help. Seconds later the train struck and killed Mr Han. 'My condolences to the family, and if I could have, I would have pulled Mr. Han out,' Abbasi said on NBC's Today show. Controversial: Tuesday's New York Post cover . The newspaper featured one of Mr Abbasi's photographs on its front page under the headline 'Doomed'. He showed Mr Han trying to pull himself from the tracks and looking into the lights of the oncoming train. In a first-person account published in . the Post, Mr Abbasi said the incident 'was one of the most horrible . things I have ever seen, to watch that man dying there.' 'The sad part is, there were people . who were close to the victim, who watched and didn't do anything. You . can see it in the pictures.'

Legree, who could see Han from his . seat at the head of the train, told the Daily News he noticed people on . the platform waving their arms to warn him and said he slammed on the . emergency brake when he saw Han on the roadbed. Legree said he was feeling 'all kinds . of emotions from ""Why is this happening"" to ""Why was that guy down . there"" to ""What happened?""' Mr Han's death has caused huge shock . in the city and led to pondering from some of the five million people . who use the New York subway every day. Commuter Denise Martorana, 34, said: . 'I would certainly try to do whatever I possibly could. I certainly . wouldn't be able to stand there and watch, that's for sure.' Aliyah Syphrett, 23, said she tries not to think about the risk of being pushed during her daily commute. She said: 'You know it could happen.

A baby died while sleeping between parents who had been drinking before they took the infant to bed with them. Midwives had warned the mother  - who has not been named - about the risks of sleeping beside her baby - but she admitted she repeatedly ignored their advice. The details of the tragic case were revealed in a report to Coventry City Council. The baby - named only as Child W - was born healthy in May 2011. The baby, named only as Child W, was born healthy in May 2011 at University Hospital, Walsgrave. But the mother ignored the 'safe sleeping' advice she was given before she left hospital . However, the mother ignored the 'safe . sleeping' advice she was given before she left hospital and regularly . slept with the baby between her and her partner. In July last year she woke to find the . baby had stopped breathing and called an ambulance, but paramedics . could not save the child. Officials launched a full investigation as the parents were known to social services. The child had not been taken into care but staff decided to carry out a further family assessment. Last week the city's safeguarding children board published its report, which found the tragedy could not have been prevented. But health chiefs say this was not an isolated tragedy and are warning parents against putting their babies to bed next to them. Across Coventry and Warwickshire 27 babies have died in their parents' beds since 2008. Jim O'Boyle, cabinet member for children at Coventry City Council, said he wished the tragedy could have been avoided . Carmel McCalmont, head of midwifery at . University Hospital, Walsgrave, said all pregnant women and new mothers . were advised against co-sleeping. She said: 'Babies should sleep on their back with their feet to the bottom of the Moses basket or cot. 'No matter how tired parents are they should never be tempted to bring their baby to bed with them.' Jim O'Boyle, cabinet member for children at Coventry City Council, said: 'This was a tragedy and we wish it could have been avoided. 'Parents need to realise no matter how much they love their children or think they are doing the right thing, once they are asleep and unconscious they are not in control.' Babies who sleep beside their parents are at greater risk of suffocating and harmfully overheating. There are also some risk factors that make it even more dangerous. They include co-sleeping when parents are very tired, or after drinking, taking drugs, or even some prescription medications. Smoking is another major risk factor. Ms MacCalmont said: 'Drinking alcohol and being very tired are significant risk factors because parents can sleep so deeply that they roll over and can suffocate their baby. 'Also, a lot of parents think they are doing the right thing by going outside to smoke. They don't realise the toxins remain on their clothes. We advise to avoid smoking.' Despite the dangers, some charities . continue to promote the benefits of co-sleeping, such as making it . easier for mums to breastfeed.","The child, named only as Child W, had been born healthy in May 2011 .

Two sisters have been banned from a string of high street stores after being named and shamed as professional shoplifters. 'Shopaholics' Khalida Ahmed, 36, and Nazia Haq, 32, were issued with criminal ASBOs after police said they treated their thieving expeditions as a self styled 'trade.' The sisters, from Blackburn, Lancashire, have been repeatedly arrested after being caught sneaking out with clothing and food from shops including TK Max, Boots, Argos and Marks and Spencers. Nazia Haq, 32, (left) and Khalida Ahmed, 36, (right) were issued with criminal ASBOs and banned from high street stores after being named and shamed as professional shoplifters . Blackburn town centre, just one of the places the sisters are banned from . Ahmed has convictions for shoplifting trips dating back ten years. She once left her then seven-year-old child to take the blame for a shoplifting expedition after she was caught trying to leave a Kwiksave store without paying for almost £150 worth of groceries. The pair were arrested again last June after stealing clothing from a Matalan store and food from a Farmfoods store in nearby Accrington. At Blackburn Magistrates' Court Ahmed and Haq were warned they now faced up to five years jail if they ignored the Criminal Antisocial Behaviour Order - dubbed a CRASBO - even by simply setting foot in several named high street stores. Ahmed, described as the more prolific shoplifter, is also banned from Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons, Aldi, Lidl, Farmfoods, Iceland, Boots, Argos, Marks And Spencer, Next, Matalan, Primark, TK Max, Mothercare, B&M Bargains, Debenhams, Claire’s Accessories, Accessorize, Toys ‘R’ Us and Smyths Toys in the towns of Blackburn, Darwen, Accrington and Burnley. She and Haq are banned from entering Blackburn’s shopping area and the the town’s Townsmoor retail park for the next two years. The CRASBO differs from regular ASBOs as they will be posted onto the sisters’ criminal records. A third sister, Rizwana Ahmed, 33, pleaded guilty to stealing clothes from Matalan but escaped getting an ASBO because it was her first conviction. Sgt David Clarke of Lancashire Police said CRASBO would be extended if Khalida and Nazia began 'plying their trade' further afield. The pair are banned from a host of shops, including Marks And Spencer, in the towns of Blackburn, Darwen, Accrington and Burnley . He said: 'At the moment we hope it will be a nice Christmas present for the shopkeepers of Blackburn and the rest of East Lancashire from Lancashire Constabulary. 'These women, especially Khalida Ahmed, are prolific shoplifters and we hope these orders can dramatically reduce their offending.' It is believed Klhaklida Ahmed first ventured into shoplifting in 2002 after her husband -  a part-time taxi driver - was forced to take time off because the engine in his car had needed replacing. She appeared in court in July of that year after pleaded guilty to stealing 118 items of grocery worth £147. That hearing was told a customer doing his weekly shopping in Kwiksave, Blackburn had seen Ahmed acting suspiciously and kept watch on her. She was standing near the entrance to the shop and he heard her tell her then seven-year-old son to go and fetch his dad and to tell him to bring the money in. Ahmed then left by a side exit and the man gave chase, eventually confronting her at the front of the shop where he demanded to know if she was going to pay for the trolley load of goods she had with her. She ran off and the shopper chased after her at which point Ahmed began screaming that she was being attacked. The man let go of her and took hold of the boy and Ahmed again ran off. Last year Haq was ordered to pay £40 costs for stealing £80 of Lucozade and frozen food from Farmfoods in Accrington. Both were then arrested in July for stealing from Matalan. Ahmed was also detained for shoplifting at Farmfoods and Argos. In the latest hearing Ahmed was given a conditional discharge for 24 months and Haq a conditional discharge for 12 months. They were both ordered to pay £100 compensation to Matalan. Rizwana was given a conditional discharge for 12 months and ordered to pay £100 compensation and £100 costs. Carl Gaffney, prosecuting, said Rizwana only had one previous conviction and had effectively found herself in 'rum company.' He added: 'The other two are professional shoplifters as far as the prosecution are concerned.' Mr Gaffney said Ahmed and Haq were aware that if there were further offences in other towns, such as Bolton or Preston, the police would seek to have the ASBO extended to cover those towns. He said: 'The ASBO is not a paper tiger, it is a court order. I say for their benefit that they will be ripe for custodial sentences if they breach these orders. This is very much a last chance saloon for them.' Scott Parker, defending, said his clients had been remanded in custody for eight days during the latest proceedings and this had acted as a 'wake-up call.'","Khalida Ahmed, 36, and Nazia Haq, 32, have been handed criminal ASBOs after treating stealing as their 'trade'

The owner of Arsenal Football Club has bought the ultimate field of dreams - an £80million farm. With Arsenal in tenth place in the Premiership after a disastrous run of results, plenty of fans have called for Gunners boss Arsene Wenger to stand down. Now billionaire businessman Stan Kroenke has found an ideal location for Wenger to be 'put out to pasture' - this 124,000 acre ranch in the Rocky Mountains of Montana, USA. Scroll down for video . Not bad: The 10,000-square-foot main house overlooks the Sun River and comes with indoor pool . River view: The main house looks out over the 20 miles of the Sun River that run through Broken O Ranch . Welcome: Stone floors and hunting trophies give the main house a hunting lodge feel . The 65-year-old, who owns 66 per cent of Arsenal, agreed an undisclosed figure for the ranch last week - which was being marketed for $132 million (£80m). Covering the equivalent of 71,000 Arsenal pitches, the Broken O Ranch runs 3,500 mother cows, 800 replacement heifers and 175 range bulls. Such is the vastness of Broken O that the UK's second largest city, Birmingham, at 103 square miles or 66,174 hectares, would virtually fit into it twice. Situated along the eastern edge of the stunning Rocky Mountain Front - the Broken O Ranch is regarded as one of the US's most grand and significant ranches. It was owned by the Moore family who spent around 25 years building it up and includes more than 20 miles of the Sun River coursing through it. The Sun River corridor provides exceptional brown and rainbow trout fishing, antelope, whitetail and mule deer hunting, as well as extensive upland game bird and waterfowl populations. Room with a view: The main house gives panoramic views right up to the Rocky Mountains . Huge: Broken O Ranch covers the equivalent of 71,000 Arsenal pitches . Each year the ranch produces 25,000 tons of alfalfa hay and 700,000 bushels of small-grain crops. Denver-based Kroenke, who is worth £2.5 billion, is now thought to be the eighth largest landowner in the USA following his latest purchase - owning an estimated 864,000 acres. Real estate company Hall and Hall managed the sale for Mr Kroenke, who also owns a number of US sports franchises. Location: Broken O Ranch spans Lewis & Clark, Cascade and Teton counties and is 45 miles west of Great Falls and east of the stunning Rocky Mountains . Legacy: Mr Kroenke is said to be looking forward to building on the work done by previous owners in making Broken O one of the most significant farming ranches in the US . Vast: The UK city of Birmingham could fit twice into the Broken O Ranch . Sam Connolly, general manager of Kroenke Ranches, said: 'Bill Moore obviously had the vision, expertise and wherewithal to assemble one of the finest cattle and farming operations in the United States. 'Mr Kroenke looks forward to building on that incredible legacy.' A statement from the Moore family added: 'We are pleased that the Broken O will be in the hands of a new owner of Stan Kroenke's calibre and commitment to agriculture."" A posting in response to the story on a Montana news website read: 'Just boggles my mind that there are those of us that work so hard for what little we have and then there are those that could spend $132.2 million.

Face-off: Taylor Murphy, 29, is accused of sexually assaulting his ex-lover, Claudia Charriez, pictured . A FDNY calendar boy punched, bit and spat at his blonde pre-op transsexual model girlfriend, nearly leaving her unconscious, during a vicious brawl, jurors heard today. Taylor Murphy, 29, is accused of assaulting his ex-lover, Claudia Charriez, 31, who was kicked off American's Next Top Model in 2006 for being born a man. In opening statements of Murphy's trial, being heard in Manhattan Supreme Court, prosecutors claimed Murphy 'grabbed her with his massive hands' during the August 2011 dispute in their room at the Hotel Metro on 35th street. 'He punched her in the back on the right side, by the shoulder blade, assistant district attorney Kevin Rooney said, according to The New York Post. 'Enough to make her fear what was coming as he slammed the door shut... the two struggled. He bit her on the forearm. 'Ultimately he pinned her down on the bed... all 240 pounds of her on top of her, into her, until she felt like she was literally engulfed by the bed.' His voice rising, Rooney continued: 'He spit at her. Covering her mouth so she couldn't scream.' In his opening statement, defense lawyer Jason Berland described the couple as having 'a textbook dysfunctional relationship.' Berland told jurors that Charriez had been working as a prostitute and the love affair 'unfortunately went south' when Murphy discovered the woman was sick with 'a venereal disease.' 'Because he loved her he begged her to stop working as an escort,' he said, according to The Post. 'But his pleas fell on deaf ears' and Murphy, who is bisexual and has a penchant for trannies, started seeing other people, which is when Charriez embarked on a campaign of threats and allegations against the firefighter. But the prosecution claims the breakup and subsequent beat-down was sparked by Murphy's drunken jealousy.

On a separate evening, which ended in blows, the couple visited Times Square strip club Flashdancers where, according to The Post, Murphy wound up getting a lap dance and Charriez retaliated by chatting up patrons who mistook her for an employee. Tempers flared and they took their dispute outside. She called him various expletives, the prosecutor told jurors. Then started screaming 'Rape! Rape!' the defense lawyer claimed. Murphy allegedly slammed his date into a phone booth and dragged her down the sidewalk by the hair before the pair dashed back to their room in separate cabs. There, they eventually kissed and made up, prosecutors admitted. Accused: Prosecutors alleged Charriez was punched, bitten and spat at in the brawl with Murphy, pictured .

'She began to cry and she pulled him closer to her, then he started crying and they sat up in the room for several minutes.' But the two made plans to see each other the next afternoon, the defense lawyer said, while Charriez' lawyers admit they did get together soon after the brawl. Murphy is charged with felony strangulation and felony violation of an order of protection barring him from contacting his alleged victim, which he reportedly did 1,400 times in the space of three months in the form of text messages and phone calls.

And speaking with the Today show on Tuesday morning, the men recounted how they were led blindfolded from room to room and had no idea what would happen to them. 'You think that are going to take you outside to execute you,' Engel said. 'We weren't physically beaten or tortured. It was a lot of psychological torture, threats of being killed. 'They made us choose which one of us would be shot first and when we refused there were mock shootings. They pretended to shoot Ghazi [Balkiz, an NBC producer] several times.' Cameraman John Kooistra, who was also captured, added: 'I made amends with my maker. I made good with my maker. I made good with . myself. I was prepared to die many times.' But amid their fear, they worked together to stay positive, Engel said. 'We weren't allowed to speak but if . you peek underneath the blindfold, you can see if there's a guard in the . room,' he said. 'We tried to joke around a little. We passed messages . to each other.' Safe: Engel and his crew exit a car after crossing back into Turkey on Tuesday morning .

'It did help a lot that we were together,' he said. While the captors have not not identified by NBC News, Engel said he believed they were from Shabiha, a pro-government organisation trained by Iranian revolutionaries and allied with Hezbollah. 'They were talking openly about their loyalty to the government,' he said. 'We were told that they wanted to exchange us for four Iranian agents and two Lebanese people. They captured us in order to carry out this exchange.' They were on their way to make the exchange at a Hezbollah stronghold when they were sprung. 'We're in good health.

Happiness: They were freed as their captors came across a rebel checkpoint and a firefight ensued . Richard Engel told NBC that he and his crew were abducted by the Shabiha. The organisation, the name of which translates literally as 'thugs' in Arabic, is a network of civilian militants who act as the unofficial police force of the regime for Bashar al-Assad. They were established as early as the 1970s by the brother and cousin of the former president Hafez al-Assad, father of Bashar. They are backed by the Islamic militant group Hezbollah and by Iran, and Engel explained they were trained by Iranian revolutionaries. Over the course of the unrest, the Shabiha have been accused not only of killing and beating people at demos, but also of carrying out a campaign of intimidation including executions and drive-by shootings. Shabiha gangs also run protection rackets, weapons- and drug-smuggling rings, and other criminal enterprises, the BBC reported. Engel had covertly entered Syria several . times this year to report on the insurgency fighting President Bashar . al-Assad and had last appeared on television on Thursday in a taped . report. After their kidnap on Thursday, the four men were transported to a location believed . to be near the town of Ma'arrat Misrin. On Monday, Engel and his crew were being taken to a new location when their kidnappers ran into  checkpoint manned by a Syrian rebel group,  Ahrar al-Sham, NBC News said in a statement. Following a firefight - and the . deaths of two of their captors - Engel and his crew were freed. The . network had been unable to contact them until their liberation. 'After . being kidnapped and held for five days inside Syria by an unknown . group, NBC News Chief Foreign Correspondent Richard Engel and his . production crew members have been freed unharmed. We are pleased to . report they are safely out of the country,' the network said on Tuesday. It added that there was no claim of . responsibility, no contact with the kidnappers and no request for ransom . during the time Engel and members of his production crew were missing. Engel and his crew stayed in Syria until Tuesday morning when they returned to Turkey, the network said. While they were blindfolded and bound, they were not otherwise physically harmed. At work: The chief foreign correspondent has lived in the Middle East for more than 15 years . Prominent: Engel, 39, is pictured at the end of a reporting trip in Syria in July 2012 . NBC News added that it 'expressed its gratitude to those who worked to gather information and secure the release of our colleagues'. While the Turkish media had been . circulating the report for several days, American outlets were operating under a news blackout requested by NBC until Monday. NBC had sought to keep the crew's disappearance secret while they tried to find out where they were, and news channels did not report on it in fear it could further endanger the men. Engels, who is divorced and doesn't have children, was promoted to NBC News's chief foreign correspondent in 2008. He runs NBC’s Middle East bureau and has been reporting on the ongoing conflict between rebels and forces backing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Engel is widely regarded for his coverage of wars, revolutions and political transitions around the world over the last 15 years. Support: NBC colleague David Shuster tweeted his concern after hearing Monday that Engels was missing . Achiever: In 2009, Engel received a 'Peabody' during the 68th annual George Foster Peabody Awards . Most recently, he was recognized for . his outstanding reporting on the 2011 revolution in Egypt, the conflict . in Libya and unrest throughout the Arab world. Engel, . one of the only western journalists to cover the entire war in Iraq, . joined NBC News in May 2003. He previously worked as for ABC News, most notably during the initial U.S. invasion . of Iraq. His work has received numerous awards, including five News & Documentary Emmy Awards.

The British beauty confirmed she has 'officially' stopped modelling in favour of pursuing her love of acting because she has grown disenchanted with the fashion industry over time. She said: 'I suppose I have stopped modelling officially. I've not done any for a good long while now. I think it was about four years ago when my feeling were changing towards the industry.

Prime Minister David Cameron said controlling immigration helped Britain compete in the 'global race' Migration into Britain has seen the biggest fall in 20 years, official figures revealed yesterday. A total of 536,000 foreigners came to live here in 2011, 42,000 fewer than the year before. The drop was the biggest since immigration went down by 61,000 during the 1991 recession. The numbers entering Britain were the lowest since 2004, when hundreds of thousands of Eastern European workers were allowed in. The main reason for the cut in numbers was a dramatic reduction in those arriving on student visas. Ministers hailed the figures as a major step towards achieving the Government’s aim of reducing immigration to the levels of the 1990s. The key net migration figure – the number added to the population after both immigration and emigration have been counted – dropped by nearly 25 per cent from 242,000 to 183,000. Students coming in to join courses at further education colleges went down by 67 per cent, while those going to English language schools fell by 76 per cent. However the number of foreign students going to British universities went up by 1 per cent. Student numbers have come down following limits on study visas for those living outside the European Union and a crackdown on bogus colleges used as routes to cheat the immigration system. New methods, such as interviews to check the English language skills of prospective students, were introduced last year. The number of student visas issued was 26 per cent down on the previous year. There have also been tighter controls on the issue of work visas for low-skilled workers from outside the EU. The figures are a relief to Home Secretary Theresa May and the Prime Minister, who have promised to reduce net immigration to below 100,000. Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: ‘This is a significant fall in net migration and the total number of visas issued is at its lowest since 2005. ‘This shows we are bringing immigration back under control. Our tough policies are taking effect and this marks a significant step towards bringing net migration down from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands by the end of this Parliament. ‘At the same time, we continue to attract the brightest and best: these figures show that there has been a small increase in the number of sponsored student visa applications for the university sector – and a further increase in student visit visas. It’s clear that international students continue to come to the UK’s world renowned universities.’ Graph shows annual long-term migration estimates for the UK between 1991 and 2011 . Graph shows changes in immigration from the five most common countries into the UK over the past five years . Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps added: ‘Conservatives in Government are committed to getting immigration under control. ‘This big fall in net migration shows that the tough steps we have taken to reduce the uncontrolled immigration that Labour presided over are working.’ The results won approval from Migrationwatch, the think-tank which has led criticism of high immigration. Its chairman, Sir Andrew Green, said: ‘At last we can see some light at the end of the tunnel. We can now see the first effects of the Government’s measures to reduce immigration. There is a distance to go but they are on the right track.’ But Sarah Mulley, of the left-leaning Institute of Public Policy Research, said: ‘This fall in net migration has been driven by a significant fall in the number of foreign students coming to the UK. Clampdown: The drop was driven by an eight per cent fall in the number . of people coming to the UK to study, with 213,000 students arriving this year . compared to 232,000 last year . ‘Steps to reduce abuse of the student visa system are welcome, but if the Government’s net migration target is to be met, there also needs to be a dramatic fall in the numbers of genuine foreign students.This will come at a significant economic cost.’ Emigration from Britain helped drive down the net migration total. In the year to the end of March, 353,000 people left to live abroad, compared with 336,000 in the previous year. Study was the main reason for immigration, but there was an 8 per cent drop in the number of those coming here for formal study, with 213,000 students arriving this year compared to a peak of 232,000 in the year to March 2011. Yesterday it was revealed that more than 150,000 suspected bogus students from outside the EU have been allowed to stay here since 2009 despite border officials being warned they may have breached their visas.","Minister hails success of government's 'tough' new policies .

A motorist who killed a dog walker moments after sending a text message wept yesterday as she escaped a jail sentence. Dentist Kay Nolan, 45, had pulled over in a layby to compose a reply to a work colleague on her mobile phone but did  not send it until she had driven off again. As she did so she clipped Stuart Mather with her wing mirror and knocked him over as he walked his Scottish terrier dog, Hamish . Sentence: Kay Nolan, left, was sentenced to a 40-week suspended jail term after her car hit Stuart Mather, right. Mr Mather was hit by a second car and died . Both he and his pet were crushed by a car travelling behind. Mr Mather, a 60-year-old grandfather, was taken by air ambulance to hospital but died later and his beloved dog also perished. His family condemned those who use their mobiles at the wheel for failing to recognise the risks. Mr Mather’s son, Alex, said: ‘All too often in this day and age people are too interested in their mobile phones – but you can wait or you can pull over. Grieving: Stuart Mather's son Alex said that the sentence was 'acceptable' but 'never going to be enough' outside Preston Crown Court . ‘Just think about what you’re doing, . think about the consequences and the impact that it has. All this was . the result of sending a text message, something that could have been . deemed avoidable.’ He said: ‘No sentence was ever going to be enough. We . were left with no opportunity to say goodbye. ‘He had always wanted a granddaughter but she was born two months after he died and now she will never be able to meet him.’ Preston Crown Court heard the tragedy occurred at 5.20pm on June 6 last year as Nolan was driving home from work. She had been sent a text message by a work colleague asking for a day off and she pulled into a layby to compose her reply. But instead of sending it immediately she set off again and only pressed the send button as she approached Mr Mather. As she did so an eyewitness saw Nolan brake and swerve in a bid to avoid a collision but she clipped Mr Mather with her wing mirror. He was knocked over and crushed under the wheels of another car travelling behind at an accident blackspot in Higham, Lancashire. It later emerged Nolan, a divorced mother-of-one, had tried to save his life by attempting resuscitation at the roadside. But as she waited for the police to arrive she also deleted the offending text. Nolan, who works as a dentist at a practice near Burnley, had been facing a charge of causing death by dangerous driving, which carries a maximum 14-year prison sentence. But lawyers allowed her to plead guilty to the lesser charge of causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving, which carries a maximum five-year sentence. She wept as she was given a 40-week prison term suspended for a year and was ordered to carry out 150 hours of community work. She was also banned from driving for 12 months. Leaving court: Kay Nolan pictured leaving the court today, left. Mr Mather's family warned motorists to consider the consequences before texting at the wheel . Nolan escaped a jail sentence mainly on the basis there was no one to care for her elderly mother and her 12-year-old daughter. Judge Rabinder Singh told her: ‘This was a short distraction and albeit one that you shouldn’t have been engaged in because it was in itself an unlawful act. ‘Nothing that this court says or does can possibly provide adequate consolation to the family and friends of Mr Mather. This is truly a tragic and sad death.’","Stuart Mather died after he was hit by Kay Nolan's car in Higham, Lancs .

Confused passers by in the city have spotted the models placed in a giant dart board like human darts, left in a dumpster with only their legs showing and even playing tug of war on a rooftop as they appear to be breaking in.

The offbeat art installation was the brainchild of US street artist Mark Jenkins, 42 from Washington DC. Jenkins, who worked as a saxophonist and web designer before switching to street art, said his aim is to get people to look up from their mobile phones for a split second and engage with the world around them. He said: 'Most of the work focuses on hyper realistic situations that interact with the environment.' 'But there is usually a surrealistic aspect that sends my work into the land of the absurd.'

'And people so covered in litter that they are like bugs, which I call litterbugs.

'The reaction of passers-by is usually fear or confusion that turns to laughter.' Jenkins' first street project was a series of clear tape casts made from his body that he installed on the streets in Rio de Janeiro, in 2003. In 2005 he began working with Sandra Fernandez on the Storker Project, a series where tape 'babies' are 'dropped' in different cities . He told the Washington Post: 'People are generally curious. Kids, adults, and a police officer have approached with the question “What is that?” Then that’s usually followed by “How many rolls of tape did it take?” 'What I’m doing is similar to the way writers and filmmakers create a fictitious reality.

The first Boeing 787 Dreamliner to touch down in the UK has arrived at Heathrow Airport. Qatar Airways became the first airline to run a regular service in Britain using the planes which have been dubbed the worlds most advanced airliner. Carrying an official delegation from the capital of Qatar, the aircraft landed in London from Doha.

Scroll down for video . Touch down: Qatar Airways new Boeing 787 Dreamliner taxis along the runway at Heathrow Airport following its inaugural flight to London . Business class: Qatar Airways has become the first airline to operate regular scheduled flights with the 787 Dreamliner to and from the UK . UK airlines including Virgin, British Airways and Thomson have also ordered Dreamliners, which are designed to carry up to 290 passengers, for their fleets. The so-called 'green planes' boast LED . lighting rather than harsh fluorescent bulbs, as well as bigger windows, . wider aisles and higher ceilings than the average passenger plane. Boeing also claims the planes have cleaner cabin air, meaning those on board are less likely to become dehydrated. The Dreamliner is also equipped with 'Smoother Ride Technology' which senses turbulence and commands wing control surfaces to counter it - offering a more comfortable flight and reducing the risk of motion sickness. Doha-based carrier Qatar Airways expects to take . delivery of two further Dreamliners later this month. It expects to have 10 of . the lightweight jets in service by the end of 2013, a reduction from . the initial plan for 30.

London's iconic black cabs are set to be the next WiFi hotspots as a free internet service will be rolled out early next year. Similar to London Underground commuters who are able to access WiFi from some stations, cab passengers will have 15 minutes of free internet access after watching a 15 second advert. The CabWiFi network received approval by Transport for London last Thursday after start-up company Eyetease spent two years on their bid for the novel idea. Cab connection: There are plans for free WiFi to be rolled out in London's iconic black cabs early next year after Transports for London approved the idea last week . With free access to the internet and their own login, cab drivers will be able to offset the often high cost of data charges incurred using taxi apps, which some drivers claim have doubled their phone bills in recent months. Eyetease CEO Richard Corbett said: ‘With dwell times averaging 15 minutes in the back of a taxi, what better way to pass the time than to use your laptop, tablet, book reader or phone with guilt free internet access. ‘Tourists and business travellers can now access their emails, talk on Skype or surf the web without the fear of being hit with high data roaming charges when they return home.’ The system, manufactured in Latvia, works by turning 3G and 4G mobile connectivity into a WiFi hotspot for passengers and takes just two minutes to install. 'Ads for access': Cab passengers will have to watch a 15 second advert to get 15 minutes free WiFi access . To access the service, an ‘ads for access’ model has been used, similar to popular sites such as Spotify and Youtube. The company said they were in ‘progressed conversations with several major consumer brands’ including a global credit card company and a leading mobile phone manufacturer to sponsor the roll out of the network. There are some 22,000 black cabs in London and according to The Wall Street Journal Mr Corbett said: ‘We already have 500 cabs signed up with no marketing.’ On . the Underground, there are 92 tube stations so far that have WiFi after . the service was put in place in time for the Olympics this year. The . Virgin Media WiFi network is free until the end of January 2013 when . full internet access will only be available free to Virgin customers. Other commuters will have to purchase WiFi passes. Passengers are able to access emails and websites and stream videos while they are stand on platforms or escalators. They will lose the connection when the train goes through a tunnel, but will automatically reconnect at the next stop. Almost half of all internet users use a mobile phone to connect to the internet, according to National Statistics figures from August 2011.

Two underworld crime bosses were branded the 'merchants of death'  after being caught buying a military grade sub-machine gun for use in a vicious turf feud. 'Mr Bigs' Sohail Aurengzeb, 28, and Biny Amin, 45, were detained during a swoop by armed police after officers secretly trailed them as they completed an arms deal with another racketeering gang operating 100 miles away. The pair paid up to £15,000 in cash for a Skorpian sub-machine gun - which fires 1,000 rounds of ammunition per minute and is used by the Czechoslovakian army -  to be used in a deadly drugs war they were fighting with rival gangs in Greater Manchester. 'Mr Bigs' Biny Amin, 45, (left) and Sohail Aurengzeb, 28 (right) were caught buying a military grade sub-machine gun for use in a vicious turf feud . Weapon of war: The Skorpion is a military grade sub-machine gun designed for the Czech army . Police found the gun stuffed in a bag along with rounds of hollowpoint 'dum dum' bullets in the front passenger footwell of a VW Golf being used by one of their lackeys - or 'runners'. They also arrested five suspects in Birmingham over the sale and trafficking of the firearm and seized two other firearms. Aurengzeb was a convicted drug dealer who turned his terraced house in Oldham into a 'mini fortress' covering his windows with iron bars and installing CCTV cameras to check on unwelcome visitors. Convicted gunman Amin was known as a 'driver' who was once a member of a motoring crime gang which in the 1990s used a modified Casio watch to unlock cars with central locking systems and disable their car alarms. Today Aurengzeb was beginning a 15 year sentence after he admitted possession of a firearm and ammunition with intent to endanger life and drug offences. Amin, formerly of Longsight, Manchester was jailed for 14 years after being convicted by a jury of possession of a firearm and ammunition with intent to endanger life. After the case Det Insp Chris Mossop, from Greater Manchester Police, said he was sure the convictions had prevented someone 'being shot and probably killed'. He said: 'The Skorpion machine gun is not a weapon carried for 'protection' or to be regarded as a 'status symbol.' 'The reality is plain and simple - it is designed for and was bought with the intention of maiming and killing. 'This case is just one of a number of recent and ongoing investigations into the most dangerous and prolific offenders on our streets and once again proves we are the thorn in the side of organised crime gangs.' Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester was told both men struck a deal with gangsters operating in Birmingham to obtain the machine gun in August last year. In 2009 Oldham had been in the grip of a gang war between groups from the town plus Bolton and Manchester which left three men dead and three others wounded. Turf war: The Skorpion was found stuffed in a bag in the footwell of a car driven by an accomplice of the pair . Pictured are the dum dum bullets sold in the arms deal. Police say the men's convictions had prevented someone 'being shot and probably killed' A silencer and bullet recovered during the investigation. Police say the weapon was bought with the intention of maiming and killing . Just days before the arms deal, three men were cleared of shooting dead one of the victims - a 21-year old shop worker who was gunned down outside a doctor's surgery in Oldham during a dispute over a cannabis farm. On August 6 2011 Aurengzeb and Amin sent an accomplice ahead while they made their own way to a rendezvous with the Birmingham gang in a separate car. Fearing they were being followed, the men tried to shake off any tails by completing a lap of the M60 orbital motorway and also slowing down at green traffic lights before speeding up when the lights turned red. But officers kept track of the two cars and followed them to flats in Wednesbury in the West Midlands before allowing them to return to Manchester where they arrested occupants of both cars. Police later found a giant drugs press used to package heroin at a property linked to Aurangzeb. As a result of the double swoop, GMP shared intelligence on their investigation with West Midlands Police and five other suspects were held in Birmingham and a Russian made Baikal self loading pistol and Smith and Wesson revolver were seized.

A picture of the Skorpion machine gun was recovered from a mobile phone used by the Birmingham gangsters. Det Chief Supt Darren Shenton, head of GMP's Serious Crime Division, said: 'We have taken out a firearms supply chain and recovered a number of deadly weapons in the process. 'This case proves that we will work with other police forces and will not hesitate to go beyond our geographical boundaries in order to bring serious organised criminals to justice. 'The sentences handed down reflect the threat posed by the defendants and the deadly weapons they traded and communities are safer with them behind bars.' David Rouse from the West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service's Complex Casework Unit, said: 'These individuals were merchants of death and they had little disregard into the pain and suffering that these weapons and drugs can cause to people, families and to the local communities. 'This has been an important case for the criminal justice system as we want to demonstrate to the public that we will robustly prosecute those who seek to trade illegally in guns and drugs. 'It is vital in the light of the harm caused by illegal firearms, and to ensure that our communities feel safe, that such prosecutions are undertaken and dangerous weapons are taken off the streets. We have removed a significant threat to law and order.' Ajaz Nazir, 33, of Oldham was found guilty of possessing a firearm and ammunition and was jailed for seven years at an earlier hearing. Illyas Idrees, 27, of Wednesbury, West Midlands pleaded guilty to possessing a firearm and drugs supply and was jailed for five and a half years.

"By . Eifion Rees . PUBLISHED: . 17:00 EST, 8 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:59 EST, 10 December 2012 . Multi-generational households are becoming increasingly popular in Britain, with almost 36 million over-18s having lived in a house containing two or three generations of adults, according to a recent report by insurance company Aviva. But the Harland family has gone one step further. They are one of the few four-generational – or 4G – households in the country. Mike Harland and his wife Cathy live in The Malt House, a seven-bedroom property in Crookham, outside Newbury in Berkshire, with Cathy’s mother, Ann Hayman, Mike’s son Dominic and wife Marina, and her son Michael, 12, and Dominic’s two sons, Timothy, 14, and William, eight. Under one roof: Mike Harland, left, and wife Cathy, far right, lives with her mother Ann, Mike's son Dominic, and grandsons Timothy, 14, and eight-year-old William . The house is split down the middle, with Dominic’s family on one side and Mike and Cathy on the other, while Ann lives in a separate annexe. ‘You grow far more living together as one family,’ says Mike, 65, who co-owns the property with Dominic, 38. ‘You can do much more with the rest of the family than on your own.’ Ann, 77, says: ‘It works out very well for all of us. I look after the dogs during the day and keep things tidy and because I know when everyone’s coming home I can put something in the oven ready for when they get back.’ Sixteen years ago, Cathy, an admin manager, and Mike, a computer engineer, asked Ann to move in with them in a house in Diss, Norfolk. The set-up proved a success but the area was less than ideal for them and they decided to make a move to Berkshire to be closer to Mike’s children and grandchildren. 4G home: The family all live together in The Malthouse, a seven-bedroom property outside Newbury, Berkshire . Personal space: A bedroom in the west wing of the house, where Mike and Cathy lives . ‘Property prices were astronomical,’ recalls Mike. ‘So we suggested to Dominic that we consider pooling our finances and buying one big house, and he said yes.’ The hunt began for a property big enough to accommodate eight of them. The Malt House was the answer to their dreams – or at least had the potential to be. The red-brick property, built in 1850 and a former borstal, had lain derelict for years. But set in rolling countryside perfect for walking the family’s five border collies and with easy access to Aldermaston, where Dominic’s business is based, it seemed perfect. They bought the house for £550,000 and . spent £300,000 renovating it and adding an extension. The goal was to . create two separate homes under one roof. The more traditional ‘west wing’, . with its exposed beams, oak floors, rugs and large, cosy drawing room . with wood-burning stove, belongs to Mike and Cathy. Homely: A bathroom in The Malthouse which is on the market for £950,000 . The first floor, which in the borstal days was divided into tiny ‘cells’ for offenders, now has two guest bedrooms. The second floor – formerly empty roof space accessed via a trap door – contains a light-filled master suite, with bathroom and storage room that could be converted into a nursery. The ‘east wing’ – which has its own front door but can be accessed through a connecting door on the first floor – is occupied by Dominic, Marina and the children. It has a younger feel, with underfloor heating, modern colours and a new kitchen with central island. The Malt House offers slightly more than 4,000  sq ft of living space. ‘We can all disappear,’ says Ann. ‘There are enough bathrooms, so there’s no need to queue in the morning. It’s big enough not to step on one another’s toes. It’s been wonderful, as I would have been lonely living alone.’ James Dawson. of agents Jackson-Stops & Staff, says: ‘It is rare to find four generations living together – and unusual to find a property that lends itself to four generations so well.’ The Harlands’ arrangement is coming to an end because Dominic wants his own place, but Mike, Cathy and Ann hope to find somewhere to live in the same area. The house is on the market at £950,000. jackson-stops.co.uk; 01635 45501 .",Mike and Cathy Harland live with three generations of their family .

Recovering: Nelson Mandela is recovering from an operation to remove gallstones, carried out in a private clinic in Pretoria . Doctors are keeping Nelson Mandela in hospital but insisted today that there is 'no crisis'. The former South African President is recovering in hospital after having an operation to remove gallstones, and a presidential spokesman said he is 'looking much better'. The 94-year-old, who was South Africa's first black president, underwent the surgery at a private clinic in Pretoria. President Jacob Zuma said Mr Mandela needed 'extraordinary care' because of his age, and added: 'If he spends more days in hospital, it is because that necessary care is being provided.' He had previously been hospitalised on December 8, suffering from a lung infection. 'Doctors are satisfied that the progress he is making is consistent with his age. They say there is no crisis, but add that they are in no hurry to send him home just yet until they are satisfied that he has made sufficient progress,' presidential spokesman Mac Maharaj said. South Africans have been worried about . Mr Mandela's health since he was airlifted to the clinic from his home . in Qunu in the Eastern Cape. While in hospital, tests revealed the . presence of gallstones and it was decided the operation would be carried . out after he had recovered. Gallstones are an accumulation of . crystals in the gall bladder. The condition can become life-threatening . because of the risks of secondary infections such as pancreatitis. Mr Madela's wife previously caused concern when she said his trademark 'spirit and sparkle' was waning. Graca Machel told a South African television news channel that it was painful to see her 94-year-old husband 'fading.' Scroll down for video . Smiling: Mr Mandela made his last public appearance alongside his wife Graca Machel at Johannesburg's Soccer City stadium during the closing ceremony for the 2010 World Cup . 'I mean, this spirit and this sparkle, you see that somehow it's fading,' she told eNews Central Africa. Mr Mandela's grand-daughter Ndileka told the same news channel that the anti-apartheid icon has come to accept his condition. 'He . has come to accept that it's part of growing old, and it's part of . humanity as such', she said. 'At some point you will dependent on . someone else, he has come to embrace it'. The pair's comments were the first official remarks by his family since the former President was rushed to hospital. The anti-apartheid leader is particularly susceptible to illness because of his age and his 27 years in prison, though medics say he is responding well to treatment. He fought off a similar lung infection in 2011 and once contracted tuberculosis while imprisoned. Medical experts say respiratory . illnesses like pneumonia striking a man his age are a serious matter . that require care and monitoring. His ongoing hospitalisation . has caused growing concern in South Africa, a nation of 50 million . people that largely reveres him for being the nation's first . democratically elected president who sought to bring the country . together after centuries of racial division. Tests at 1 . Military Hospital near South Africa's capital, Pretoria, detected the . lung infection, presidential spokesman Mr Maharaj previously said in a statement. Public concern: Broadcast vans parked near the 1 Military Hospital where South Africa's former President Nelson Mandela is hospitalised . Security: South African military police officers check cars entering the 1 Military Hospital . 'Madiba is receiving appropriate . treatment and he is responding to the treatment,' Maharaj said, . referring to Mr Mandela by his clan name as many do in South Africa as a . sign of affection. In January 2011, Mr Mandela was . admitted to a Johannesburg hospital for what officials initially . described as tests but what turned out to be an acute respiratory . infection. The chaos that followed his stay at . that public hospital, with journalists and members of the public surrounding it . and entering wards, saw the South African military take charge of his . care and the government control the information about his health. In recent days many in the press and . public have complained about the lack of concrete details that the . government has released about the former president's condition. They had not divulged why he had been . flown over 500 miles from his rural home to undergo the urgent tests . prompting many to fear the worst. Over the weekend the South African . Sunday Times newspaper quoted a source as saying 'he has not been . talking. He is not looking good'. The country's defence . minister visited the Nobel Peace Prize winner at the Pretoria military . hospital in which he is being treated. Afterwards Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula . echoed the official, placatory message, telling reporters that Mr . Mandela was 'doing very, very well'. Rallying round: Worshippers pray at the Regina Mundi Church in Soweto. Calls for prayer have been made for former president Nelson Mandela . Bated breath: The nation has been eagerly awaiting news of his condition . She added: 'It is important to keep . him in our prayers and also to be as calm as possible and not cause a . state of panic because I think that is not what all of us need.' Mr Mandela has a history with lung . problems. He fell ill with tuberculosis in 1988 toward the tail-end of . his prison years, after he had been moved from the notorious Robben . Island and to another jail to ease the apartheid government's efforts to . negotiate with him about a possible release. After being taken to a Cape Town hospital, a doctor told him he had water in his lungs. Mr Mandela initially refused to believe the doctor, he wrote in his autobiography Long Walk to Freedom. ‘With a hint of annoyance, (the . doctor) said, “Mandela, take a look at your chest,”’ Mr Mandela . recounted. ‘He pointed out that one side of my chest was actually larger . than the other.’ Surgeons immediately cut into his . chest and removed two litres (half a gallon) of liquid from his lungs, . which tested positive for tuberculosis. Doctors at the time suggested Mr Mandela contracted the disease from his damp prison cell. About 1.4 million people worldwide . die each year from tuberculosis, a bacterial infection which can stay . dormant for years. It also can cause permanent lung damage, though in . his autobiography Mr Mandela says doctors caught it in time. Relations: Mr Mandela's last foreign visitor is believed to have been US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who had lunch with him and his wife, Graca Machel, at their Qunu home in August . However, tuberculosis can return to . trouble those previously infected, properly treated or not, and previous . damage could have been missed, Openshaw said. Openshaw, who has not seen Mr . Mandela's medical records and spoke generally about treating patients, . said pneumonia is the most likely respiratory illness to affect an . elderly person, though others can strike as well. Mr Mandela was a leader in the . struggle against racist white rule in South Africa and once he emerged . from 27 years in prison in 1990, he won worldwide acclaim for urging . reconciliation. He won South Africa's first truly . democratic elections in 1994, serving one five-year term. The Nobel . laureate later retired from public life to live in his remote village of . Qunu, in the Eastern Cape, and last made a public appearance when his . country hosted the 2010 World Cup soccer tournament. Mr Mandela disengaged himself from . the country's politics over the last decade but continued campaigning . against AIDS. He has grown increasing frail in recent years. He went seven weeks of radiation therapy for prostate cancer in 2001, ultimately beating the disease. In February he underwent minor surgery to determine the cause of abdominal pain. Mr Mandela's last foreign visitor is believed to have been US Secretary . of State Hillary Clinton, who had lunch with him and his wife, Graca . Machel, at their Qunu home in August. In 2011 Mr Mandela's close friend Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu described him as being 'frail'. The churchman said: 'We want him to remain forever, but you know... anything can happen.'","94-year-old had previously been admitted to hospital with lung infection .

An ice-cream man has been banned from driving down a street - after he swore at residents who complained about the volume of his van's chimes. One local in Ripley, Derbyshire, described the sound when David Wilson passed by as 'like having a police car in your living room'. But the 48-year-old reacted to their complaints by swearing at the neighbours and telling one couple: 'There's nothing you can do about it.' Certainly not vanilla! One local in Ripley, Derbyshire, described the sound when David Wilson passed by as 'like having a police car in your living room' (file picture) Wilson, of Derbs, stuck his fingers up at a mother and daughter and called another resident a 'gay boy'. He was convicted of using threatening words and behaviour after the incident in November last year. Derby Crown Court fined him £945 and banned him from driving down Bridge Yard Avenue for two years. The court heard that council staff had taken an 84-decibel reading - about the noise level of a freight train - from inside a house when Wilson drove down the road. Householder Paul Cooper, who challenged Wilson on the noise, told the court: 'It was like a police car in your living room, it was so loud. 'I asked him to turn the music down. He said there was nothing I could do about it, nothing the police could do about it and nothing the council could do about it.' Wilson denied swearing at Mr Cooper and his wife, Michelle, and yelling at another resident: 'You've got your gay boy to do your dirty work.' Robert Sutch, who came out of his home when he heard the shouting, told the court: 'Wilson gave a two-fingered salute to my mother and daughter.' 'Threatening behaviour': The van driver was fined £945 and banned from the street for two years at Derby Crown Court (pictured) after sticking his fingers up at a mother and daughter and calling another neighbour a 'gay boy' Wilson was at court to appeal against his conviction, which was imposed last year by magistrates. But Judge Andrew Hamilton, sitting with two magistrates, rejected the appeal. The court was shown a video of the van going down the street on a later occasion, when there was snow on the ground. Mr Sutch could be heard saying: 'If that's not a wind-up, I don't know what is. 'Who would want to buy an ice-cream on a cold winter's day? The temperature outside must be zero.' Wilson told the hearing: 'They are just trying to get me off the estate. 'I didn't swear at him. It's not the thing to do in an ice-cream van, is it?' He denied making rude signs but agreed Mr Cooper appeared annoyed by the van's music. 'I said ""there's not a lot you can do about it,"", added Wilson. 'He said ""yes, there is and I will get it sorted."" Then he said he was going to ring the police. 'I am driving off and you have got Mr Cooper, his neighbour and some children standing there just grinning.' But Judge Hamilton said he and the magistrates accepted the residents' view of the incident. He added: 'We appreciate that there may be some ulterior motive but we take the view that Mr and Mrs Cooper are honest people who would not stoop to fabricate evidence.'","David Wilson, 48, stuck two fingers up at a mother and daughter .

Hope the people . involved are OK.' Chaos: The HGV driver had apparently managed to pull over on to the hard shoulder but sparks started a fire, which ignited the hazardous chemicals on board. The blaze caused long tailbacks after the motorway was closed in both directions . Standstill: Terrified drivers abandoned their cars and ran for their lives when the tanker exploded into a 50ft fireball on the busy motorway . A spokesperson for West Midlands Ambulance Service said: 'We were called at around 9.40am to reports of a lorry on fire. 'We sent four ambulances, two officers and specialist hazardous area response team. 'The fire has closed both sides of . the motorway and in total we have treated nine patients at the scene - . four of which are firefighters and one is the driver of the HGV. 'The other casualties were drivers of other cars who had stopped as a result of the fire. 'All nine were complaining of breathing difficulties brought on by breathing in chemical fumes coming from the lorry. Due to the toxic nature of the fumes all patients were taken to hospital.' A statement from the Strategic Co-ordinating Group, released through Warwickshire County Council, said all those who were admitted to hospital have now been released with no lasting ill-effects and there was no danger to the public following the blaze. Police closed both lanes of the motorway between junction 3 and 4 while the Highways Agency set up an exclusion zone while drivers were evacuated from their cars . The Group said in the statement: 'The group is able to reiterate its assurances to the public that no risk is posed. 'Any smouldering from the scene is a result of the burning paper and is not connected to chemicals. 'Work is progressing to get the people displaced from their vehicles to Corley Services Station back on the road. Our priority will then be to get the M6 open again.' A spokeswoman for the Highways Agency said: 'Road users are advised that both carriageways of the M6 between junctions 2 and 4 near Coventry have re-opened to traffic. 'The M6 southbound fully re-opened between junctions 4 and 3 at around 7.45pm, with the M6 northbound between junctions 3 and 3a fully re-opening at 10pm. 'A small section (about 40 metres) of the hard shoulder on the M6 northbound, between junctions 3 and 3a, was damaged and will remain coned off until it can be resurfaced. 'This follows an incident at 9.45am, this morning (12 December) involving a HGV carrying chemicals along the northbound carriageway between junctions 3 and 3a that caught fire after a tyre blowout. 'Due to the severity of the incident, the M6 was closed in both directions and an exclusion zone was put in place for the safety of road users. 'Throughout the incident, the Highways Agency worked very closely with Warwickshire Police and Warwickshire Fire & Rescue Service. The incident was police-led until around 6.20pm.' Monday's crash caused chaos on the busy motorway when damaged vehicles were thrown across its carriageways. Alan Bullock, 54, from the Blackpool area, died at the scene from his injuries on a busy morning and two others were airlifted to hospital. One section of the motorway was closed for more than ten hours after two vans, two HGVs and five cars collided, causing huge delays for other motorists.","Motorists evacuated from their cars and warned to expect major delays .

A disgraced detective who slipped away from his police duties to meet his drug dealer and buy rocks of crack cocaine was behind bars today. Det Con John 'Sam' Griffiths, 31, should have been investigating Boxing Day burglaries for Cheshire Police but instead sneaked off during his shift to pay £50 to feed his secret addiction. He put off colleagues who asked him to go to a house where there had been a break-in, claiming he was a 'committed to an inquiry', before appearing at the crime scene 35 minutes later. Later, in the run up to another meeting, Griffiths texted the dealer saying: 'Mate it is my birthday and I want to meet you but last time it was rubbish. Is it rock this time? I will get a few if it is good', a jury heard. Late: Detective constable John 'Sam' Griffiths was supposed to be heading to the scene of a break-in when he slipped away to buy crack cocaine . Other texts read: 'Hi mate that stuff was okay on Friday but it was mixed. If you give me a pure bag I will give you £80.' Another said: 'I'm hearing good things my friend, save one for me and I'll be there later.' He also wrote: 'Ten minutes pal get me a good one ready'. The officer was arrested along with his Albanian dealer Bledi Malecaj, 32, after police kept surveillance on them and watched as they completed a transaction near a hotel in Manchester. Griffiths, who was based in Warrington, confessed he had been regularly using cocaine for 12 months. He had become hooked on the drug after snorting it with a colleague because he was experiencing 'difficulties' at home. He quit the force last April. Griffiths, from Chorlton, Manchester, was convicted of misconduct in a public office and possessing cocaine following a week-long trial at Manchester Crown Court, and was jailed for eight months. Disappointment: The judge at Manchester Crown Court said Griffiths had 'let down the public' by going to buy drugs while he was supposed to be working . Judge Michael Henshell told him: 'Your conduct has greatly eroded public confidence in the police. The serious aspect of this case was of course that you were a police officer charged with public duties which are sadly are now behind you. 'You were meeting on a regular basis with criminals that were supplying drugs. On December 26 you put your own addiction before your duty. 'It is undoubtedly the case that because of the amount of contact you had with the dealers you were very close to them indeed. This is the shortest possible sentence when the public has been let down as badly as they have here.' Earlier, the court heard how Griffiths joined the Cheshire Constabulary in 2003 and served in Ellesmere Port and Warrington. Addicted: Griffiths admitted he had been regularly using cocaine for 12 months - sometimes with a colleague . He met his downfall after sending texts to PC Mike Burton in July last year that made reference to buying drugs and adding: 'I'm psyching myself up'. The court heard that Mr Burton's brother knew a dealer and he and Griffiths would snort cocaine when out drinking after work. As his habit grew, Griffiths began calling and texting Malecaj directly. The dealer would use names like 'Terry' and 'Eddie' during communication. On Boxing Day last year, Griffiths had been working a 9am to 5pm shift investigating burglaries. Richard Vardon, prosecuting, said he began using a police radio belonging to another officer who was off duty and at 1.16pm told his control room he was attending a call in Partington, which is usually under the jurisdiction of Greater Manchester Police. Starting at 2.23pm, there was a series of calls between the officer and a drug dealer. Mr Vardon said: 'At 2.46pm he was asked to attend a burglary in Warrington. He stated he was committed to an inquiry but would attend within the hour. The prosecution say this is entirely bogus. The police radio used by him cell sites in the area of Blackfriars in Manchester.' At 2.48pm, Griffiths called the dealer, before leaving Manchester to travel back to Cheshire, where he arrived at the burglary at 3.21pm. It was claimed the second meeting between Griffiths and his dealer took place the following January while he was off duty. He was seen by officers in the Waterhouse pub in Manchester, where he bought a meal by card and got cashback to pay for his drugs. At 7.38pm, he texted the dealer in 'a pally way' and met him near a Travelodge. Police officers claim that they saw some sort of exchange between the two, at which point they arrested Griffiths and Malecaj. Griffiths was seen dropping a small, resealable plastic bag on to the pavement, which was found to contain cocaine. Malecaj was caught in possession of £50 and seven plastic baggies containing white powdered cocaine. He was later jailed for two years for possessing drugs with intent to supply. Burton was arrested but later released without charge. He has now quit the force. Griffiths said he has since given up drugs and found another job. Det Supt John Armstrong, of the Cheshire Constabulary's Professional Standards Department, said after the case: 'Sam Griffiths brought the Constabulary and its people into disrepute by engaging in blatant criminality and he will now face the consequences of his actions. 'Improper conduct and criminality committed by those who are appointed to protect the public and uphold the law, will not be tolerated and will be dealt with robustly. 'Any officer who misconducts themselves in this or any other manner, will be subject to a thorough investigation and will face significant likelihood of a criminal prosecution and swift removal from the Force. Random and intelligence-led drug testing are adopted by the Force and any officer may be subject to spontaneous testing.'","Sam Griffiths delayed going to a Boxing Day break-in while he went to buy crack cocaine .

Fortunately there are no unmade beds included, but with Hockney’s Beverly Hills Housewife selling at auction for more than £5.2 million three years ago, the present is likely to be worth a small fortune. Fortunately the monarch, who celebrated 60 years on the throne in June, has given the collection of Jubilee-inspired prints, drawings, photographs and works in oil, watercolour and mixed media, to the Royal Collection on behalf of the nation, who will display them at the Queen’s Gallery at Buckingham palace next autumn.

The Queen is Patron of the Royal Academy, which was founded by George III in 1768 as a professional body for artists and a venue for exhibitions that would be open to the public. Remarkably, Yorkshire-born Hockney chose to create his Jubilee-themed masterpiece on his iPad, while Emin chose to offer a surprisingly restrained monoprint portrait - a form of printmaking that has images or lines that can only be made once - of the Queen herself.

Police probing the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal have arrested a man in his 60s on suspicion of sexual offences. The man, from London, was arrested at 6.45am as part of Operation Yewtree, the investigation into allegations of sex abuse surrounding Savile and others. He has now been bailed until January, police said. He is the seventh man arrested as part of the investigation and is now being questioned at a south London police station, Scotland Yard said. The man was arrested as part of Operation Yewtree, the police investigation set up after Jimmy Savile was exposed as a serial abuser (file picture) They added: 'Officers working on Operation Yewtree have this morning, Monday 10 December, arrested a man in his 60s in connection with the investigation. 'The man from London was arrested at 06:45hrs on suspicion of sexual offences and has been taken into a south London police station. 'The individual falls under the strand of the investigation we have termed ""Others"". 'We are not prepared to discuss further.' The force is leading the national probe into claims made against the disgraced TV presenter and figures in the entertainment industry. It is understood that up to 25 celebrities have been named to police as abusers. A source with knowledge of the inquiry was yesterday quoted by the Sunday Times as saying: 'They all tend to be white men of the Savile generation'. In some cases victims will not be identified or press charges. But in at least a dozen cases, police are reported to believe there is enough evidence for the celebrities to be detained. The source added: 'We are halfway through'. The investigation has three strands, one dealing with allegations directly involving Jimmy Savile, the second involving allegations against associates of the disgraced DJ and the third involving 'others'. Operation Yewtree has already cost around £2million and involves a team of 30 officers. PR guru Max Clifford (left) leaves his Surrey home after being arrested by police last week.

Photographer and artist Jason Levesque was walking around an art show in Miami Beach when he found a series of paintings that looked more than a little bit familiar. Two of the paintings, on sale for around $4,000, had more than a passing resemblance to a pair of stills he had taken, while a third looked an awful lot like an image captured by his close friend Marie Killen. An outraged Levesque took to Facebook and exposed Josafat Miranda, the artist behind the three paintings on display. Uncanny: This painting of a woman with smeared lipstick and bunny ears is clearly inspired by Levesque's photo (below) Exposed: The online art world reacted angrily to Miranda copying the photographer's work and that of his friend . Mirror image: Levesque posted the original images alongside Miranda's on Facebook to expose the similarities . He posted his original pictures alongside Miranda's work, and wrote: 'What Josafat Miranda has done here reveals a total disrespect for photography as an art form. 'He’s quickly and with very little creative altercation, harvesting the yield of someone else’s hard work. 'What makes a painting strong, isn’t just the brush strokes and the rendering method, more, much more, than that is the composition, the subject matter and the hundreds of creative decisions that go into making an original piece of art.' Miranda’s Facebook page has since been taken offline and he told the Miami New Times the accusations have ruined his reputation and exposed him to a barrage of online threats and insults. Consequence: Miranda says he has been ruined financially and professionally by the whole incident . He said: 'I didn’t steal these images. My only mistake was not giving the original artists credit.I’ve now spoken to them and apologised to them. 'We came to the agreement that I have to take everything down and destroy it, which is exactly what I’m going to do. 'Now everything is all f****d up. I don’t have a gallery. I don’t have a job. I don’t have any way to make money.' A Wynwood-based gallery has since pulled all of his work, cancelled his pending sales, pulled his work from the gallery's website and apologised to Levesque. Victim: Jason Levesque (left) was angry about his work being used, but has still urged the painter to continue creating art. (Right) Fellow artist Marie Killen . Miranda's paintings were on sale for roughly $4,000 before they were pulled by a gallery concerned by their similarity to Levesque and Kellin's work . 'It's a crushing blow to an artist. I'm in no way mean or vindictive or wanting to see that happen,' he said. Levesque said Miranda did send him an apology and called his work a 'tribute' but Levesque says he should not have kept the source a secret. The one positive from the affair, Levesque said, is it shows how the art world has a way of policing itself. However, he does feel Miranda has talent and should keep painting. He urged him to pick up a camera and capture his own inspiration for his art. Marie Killen, who also appears in many of the images, also found one of her photos had been recreated . Miranda has now agreed to destroy any artwork he created using Levesque and Killen's work for inspiration .","Jason Levesque finds painted copies of his photographs at Miami gallery .

Wangchen Kyi, 16, self-immolated and died in western Qinghai province on Sunday evening. Campaign group Free Tibet reported that her final words were: 'Long live His Holiness the Dalai Lama, long live the Tibetan People'. The London-based organisation said the girl was 16 and and leaves behind her parents and two sisters. Plight: Wangchen Kyi, a 16-year-old girl, has self-immolated to protest the Chinese occupation of Tibet. She is the 95th person since February 2011 to do so, and the eighth child . The International Campaign for Tibet, another Tibet awareness organisation, said Wangchen set herself on fire on the nomadic grasslands of Zeku county, where she was later cremated. She was on holiday from Tsekog County Second National Middle School in eastern Tibet at the time of her protest. Authorities confirmed the self-immolation today. The local community claimed her body and an estimated three thousand local people attended her cremation service at around midnight. Last week 17-year-old nun Sangay Dolma burned herself alive in front of a Chinese government office. On her hand is written: 'Tibet is an independent nantion' Voice of America, a broadcasting service funded by the U.S. government, quoted sources who said two trucks of Chinese armed police arrived and forcibly dispersed the gathered crowd and asked them to return to their homes. The broadcaster also reported that she is survived by her father Sonam Tsering and mother Sermo, and two other siblings. Ninety-five Tibetans have now self-immolated since 2009, with 28 cases reported in November alone, to protest over what activists say are threats to their religion and culture under Chinese rule. This wave of self-immolations reveal the desperation among Tibet's youth after 60 years under Beijing's thumb and underlie a harsh crackdown in recent years by the Chinese government any who dare question its sovereignty over the mountain nation. Last week Sangay Dolma, a 17-year-old nun at the Gonshul Nunnery near the Sangag Mindrol Dhargeyling Monastery, set fire to herself using petrol outside a Chinese government office in eastern Tibet. She had earlier taken a picture of herself in which the message 'Tibet is an independent nation' can be seen written on her hand. The Chinese government has sought to crack down on Tibetan dissidents issuing a stern warning to the authorities of eastern Tibet to punish all self-immolators and their relatives - and even those who send condolences to bereaved families. Tibetan exile Jamphel Yeshi, 27, set himself on fire during a protest in New Delhi in March. He was protesting the Chinese president's upcoming visit to India . An exile Tibetan woman cries while holding a photograph of a Tibetan youth who on September 29 allegedly burned himself in protest against Chinese rule . It said all government aid would be removed from the families of self-immolators while development projects in communities that have been home to such protesters would be cancelled. Of the estimated 95 protesters who have set themselves on fire, the majority have died of their injuries. Those who survive, are arrested and taken away. They are rarely seen again, say campaign groups. Stephanie Bridger, director of Free Tibet, said: 'Tibetans from all walks of life, young and old, mothers, nomads, students, monks and nuns are rejecting China’s occupation of their homeland.' China is reported to be cracking down on those who support protestors who burn themselves .","The teenager's desperate act was a protest against Chinese rule .

He already has 1.2 billion 'followers' in the standard sense of the word but the Pope now has another type after entering what for any 85-year old is the brave new world of the social media site. It was today announced that Pope Benedict's official handle on Twitter will be @Pontifex and within hours of the account going live this morning, the feed had attracted more than 70,000 followers. Spiritual: Most of the tweets will be updates on his weekly general audience, Sunday blessings and homilies on major Church holidays . Pope Benedict XVI will begin tweeting from December 12, with regular tweets in eight languages from the account . Even though the Pope will not begin tweeting until December 12, the feast of the Madonna of Guadalupe, he is already trending. Greg Burke, senior media advisor to the Vatican said @Pontifex is appropriate for a number of reasons. 'The handle is a good one. It means ""pope"" and it also means ""bridge builder"",' he said. 'The Pope wants to reach out to everyone,' he told a news conference. The first papal tweets will be answers to questions sent to @askPontifex. The tweets will be going out in . Spanish, English, Italian, Portuguese, German, Polish, Arabic and . French. Other languages will be added in the future. Livery: The official account features Vatican livery and images of the city state, as well as the Pope's signature . 'We are going to get a spiritual message. The Pope is not going to be walking around with a Blackberry or an iPad and no one is going to be putting words into the Pope's mouth. He will tweet what he wants to tweet,' Burke said. Primarily the tweets will come from the contents of his weekly general audience, Sunday blessings and homilies on major Church holidays. They will also include reaction to major world events, such as natural disasters. Benedict will be sending his first tweet himself on December 12 but in the future most will be written by aides and he will sign off on them before they are sent in his name. But while the Pope will be one of the world's most high-profile tweeters and have many followers, he will not be following anyone himself. The Pope's Twitter page is designed in yellow and white - the colours of the Vatican, with a backdrop of the Vatican and his picture. It may change during different liturgical seasons of the year and when he is away from the Vatican on trips. The Vatican said precautions had been taken to make sure the Pope's certified account is not hacked. Only one computer in the Vatican's secretariat of state will be used for the tweets. Pope Benedict XVI blessed the possibilities of social media last year but warned it can lead to isolation . 'The Pope's presence on Twitter is a concrete expression of his conviction that the Church must be present in the digital arena,' the Vatican said. 'This initiative is best understood in the context of his reflections on the importance of the cultural space that has been brought into being by the new technologies ... the Pope's presence on Twitter can be seen as the 'tip of the iceberg' that is the Church's presence in the world of new media,' it said in a statement. A few internet wags wryly observed the announcement. Writer Caitlin Moran, who has more than 330,000 followers, tweeted: 'So pleased I have more followers than The Pope (@Pontifex). He did only join ten minutes ago, but, still! I'M BIGGER THAN THE POPE!' The Pope, who still writes his speeches and books by hand, has given a qualified blessing to social networking. In a document issued last year, he said the possibilities of new media and social networks offered 'a great opportunity', but warned of the risks of depersonalisation, alienation, self-indulgence, and the dangers of having more virtual friends than real ones. The Vatican decided against using a personal Facebook page for the pope because they thought it was too personal an interaction and would require more manpower to keep updated. In 2009, a new Vatican website, www.pope2you.net, went live, offering an application called 'The Pope meets you on Facebook"", and another allowing the faithful to see the pontiff's speeches and messages on their iPhones or iPods. The Vatican famously got egg on its face in 2009 when it was forced to admit that, if it had surfed the web more, it might have known that a traditionalist bishop whose excommunication was lifted had for years been a Holocaust denier.","The official account went live today and was deluged with followers .

"By . Daniel Martin . PUBLISHED: . 07:07 EST, 13 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:19 EST, 14 December 2012 . Culture Secretary Maria Miller is to have her expense claims investigated by the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner . Embattled Culture Secretary Maria Miller is to have her expenses investigated by the Commons watchdog. The office of John Lyon, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, said he was opening an inquiry following a complaint that Mrs Miller had claimed more than £90,000 in second home allowances towards the cost of a house where her parents lived. The complaint was lodged earlier this week by Labour MP John Mann, who claimed the arrangement was ‘identical’ to that of former Labour minister Tony McNulty, who in 2009 was required to repay more than £13,000 claimed on a second home occupied by his parents. In that case, the Commissioner said Mr McNulty, who lost his seat in the 2010 general election, had effectively ‘subsidised’ his parents from the public purse by allowing them to live rent-free. News of the investigation comes a day after Mrs Miller’s special adviser was accused of making veiled threats to a newspaper about tougher press regulation if they wrote about the expenses claims. Despite the probe, David Cameron yesterday declared his full backing for his Culture Secretary, saying: ‘Maria Miller does an absolutely excellent job as Culture Secretary and she has my full support. ‘A newspaper has asked her a number of questions. So far as I can see, she has got excellent answers to all those questions. 'I am sure she will answer them and then get on with her job, which is what she should do.’ Mrs Miller claimed £90,718 between 2005 and 2009 for the mortgage and other expenses of a property in Wimbledon, which she told parliamentary authorities was a second home, but is where her parents also lived. She declared a property in her Basingstoke constituency as her main home. The minister defended her expenses in an interview with the London Evening Standard, saying: ‘Those expenses have been audited twice independently so I think everything’s in order. 'I obviously spoke to the Fees Office about my claims and they were happy that everything was in order.’ However, she admitted one of the ‘independent’ audits was carried out by the Conservative Party. Asked why she suddenly stopped claiming on the Wimbledon home in 2009 as the wider expenses scandal erupted, she replied: ‘Because I think there was a lot of concern about the rules and, er, a lot of concern about, you know, the whole issue, and it’s something I felt that I didn’t want to be, sort of, mixed up in, the fact that I ... I just made that decision.’ No 10 refused to confirm whether the Prime Minister and Culture Secretary had met or talked by telephone about the claims. Mrs Miller’s special adviser Joanna Hindley is reported to have called the Daily Telegraph and, during discussions about Mrs Miller’s expenses, said she wanted to ‘flag up’ the Cabinet minister’s involvement with the Leveson report on Press regulation. Downing Street’s top spin doctor Craig Oliver was also accused of mentioning the Leveson reforms in a call to the newspaper’s editor. Shadow Commons leader Angela Eagle highlighted the ‘antics’ of Miss Hindley in the Commons, claiming the intervention was an attempt to put pressure on the Telegraph. The Government seems to want to threaten the Press with statutory underpinning to control the news agenda,’ she said. No 10 insisted yesterday that Mr Oliver was simply highlighting concerns about the way the Telegraph carried out its investigation into Mrs Miller’s expense claims. Mrs Miller said this rented barn near Basingstoke was her main home, while saying the Wimbledon house where her parents lived was her second home, on which she claimed expenses .","Cabinet minister claimed £90,718 for London home where parents also lived .

The mother of the teenage girl whose home was trashed after 800 people turned up to the birthday party she advertised on Facebook could be prosecuted, police said today. Essex Police said they were considering bringing charges against former councillor Esther Hine for breaching the peace and for allowing underage drinking in her home. Mrs Hine's semi-detached house was trashed after her daughter Sarah, 14, advertised her birthday party on Facebook and it was gatecrashed by hundreds of strangers who ripped doors off hinges, jumped through the loft floor, and scrawled on walls. Drunk teenagers smashed holes in the ceiling, drew on walls and ripped doors off their hinges as around 800 youngsters descended on the Essex home . An Essex Police spokeswoman said: . 'Police are working with the family and considering whether any offences . have been committed and whether it is in the public interest to . prosecute those responsible.' Local officers are also in contact with residents of the street to establish a full picture of the events which took place.' The trail of destruction began when what was supposed to be an early 15th birthday party for Sarah Hine's 30 closest friends turned into chaos as up to 800 people arrived with bottles of alcohol having seen the party advertised on social media sites. The party was thrown by Sarah Hine, 14, but got out of control despite her mother, Esther, 56, being there to try and keep order . Discord: A piano was smashed up in the front garden before police dispersed the rowdy youngsters . Horde: Crowds of people outside the home. They were made aware of the party through social media sites . Witnesses at the party claimed teenagers had broken into the loft and were bouncing on ceiling insulation before one fell through into the bedroom . The party had been dubbed the 'Project X of Essex' Strangers from as far away as Hackney and Colchester arrived at the family home in Billericay, Essex, and over the . next couple of hours – before police arrived and called time – the . youngsters left an extraordinary trail of destruction that will cost up . to £30,000 to put right. Offensive graffiti was scrawled on walls and shelves were pulled down with their contents scattered around. The ceiling was left with a gaping hole after a group of teenagers got into the loft and leapt around on the insulation before one fell through. Rumours on Twitter suggested a hedgehog was flushed down a toilet and someone defecated on a bed. Another report suggested a grand piano had been thrown into the garden from the £305,000 five-bedroom semi-detached home. Sarah’s family denied this yesterday, saying it was an upright piano that had been in the garden at the start of the party but was destroyed by revellers. But one uncontested fact is that the 14-year-old’s mother, Esther, 56, is now counting the cost following the sickening realisation their insurers will not pay for repairs as the revellers were invited into her home. ‘I am stunned. Why would they do this?’ said local church leader Mrs Hine, whose desperate pleas to party-goers were ignored as she tried to maintain control. ‘There must be £20,000 to £30,000 damage but insurance won’t pay out because we invited them in. ‘I told the parents I would be here to keep an eye out for trouble. There wasn’t supposed to be drink but the police told me they confiscated an unbelievable amount of alcohol from the groups.’ Aftermath: Discarded alcohol lies strewn around the room among smashed and upended furniture . Debris: Homeowner Esther Hine knew the party had been advertised on Facebook two weeks ago . Venue: The Billericay house where the party was held. The damage caused by the party is estimated to be up to £30,000 . Wrecked: These cupboards were smashed open and ripped apart as drunk teens stormed the house . Destruction: A teenager was reported to have fallen through the ceiling as the party raged . Mrs Hine has yet to decide whether to press charges in relation to the damage caused by her home. She admitted she had ignored warnings two weeks ago from her daughter’s school that trouble was expected. Staff at Anglo European School in Ingatestone – rated one of the best state schools in the country – warned against the open invitation that had been posted on Facebook. But the mother of two, who is married to computer consultancy owner Andrew, 60, and has a daughter, Rachel, 19, said: ‘I just didn’t think this would happen. I knew Sarah knew some people but did not expect that many to turn up.’ The party, ahead of Sarah’s 15th in February, began at 7pm on Friday and the chaos started within minutes, with people spilling out on to the road outside. One neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: ‘It was like Belfast in the 1970s out there. It was terrifying. There were hundreds of people out to cause trouble.’ Another said: ‘It was absolute carnage as there were children pouring out of the house. ‘I would have said there was about 800 of them when the police turned up at around 8.30pm. They were trying to escape up the road, not realising it was a cul-de-sac.’ Sarah Hine’s name was even ‘trending’ on Twitter at one stage due to the number of photographs being tweeted by revellers.  She wrote on Facebook 'YOLO' - You Only Live Once. Essex Police said no one was injured at the party – the party-goer who fell through the ceiling appears to have had a lucky escape as a  double bed was immediately below. A spokesman said: ‘Police were called after calls from residents regarding nuisance behaviour in the street. Officers found a large number of teenagers had visited the area to attend a party advertised openly on social media. ‘No arrests were made and no complaints were made regarding criminal damage.’ Invite: The party's host Sarah Hines posting about the party on Facebook .

Love the banter between fans but there is a point when it goes too far...calm it!' Ferdinand also refused to let the incident keep him away from last night's X Factor final, where he was interviewed from his seat in the audience by host Dermot O'Leary. Manchester City has apologised to the player and the Football Association has launched an investigation. Ferdinand's team-mate Ashley Young told MUTV: 'It could have taken Rio's eye out and you've seen the cut on his head. 'When 'Wazza' (Rooney) was taking a . corner there were so many objects being thrown on to the pitch as well . and, on another day, if the pitch had not been so wet, the fan who came . on to the pitch wouldn't have slipped over and could have attacked Rio.' In a statement, the club said any fans found responsible would be disciplined, adding: 'Manchester City FC security officials are co-operating fully with Greater Manchester Police in relation to events leading up to the throwing of missiles onto the field of play, and between the two sets of supporters, during today's game against Manchester United. 'Manchester City wishes to offer its sincere apologies to Rio Ferdinand. The club unreservedly condemns the actions which led to his being injured.' United manager .

'It is disappointing that after a great game and advert for the Premier League that we are discussing this issue. 'We will work with the clubs and authorities to identify those responsible and support the strongest sanctions available including life bans. 'We condemn any such acts and it is simply unacceptable that any player is exposed to injury in this way. To witness Rio Ferdinand leaving the field with a cut above his eye to receive treatment is appalling. 'Football in this country has made great progress over recent decades. However, we must maintain the safety and security inside of our stadia and to do this we need to isolate and identify any individuals guilty of offences with strong penalties to act as a deterrent to others.' Match-winner van Persie was unaware Ferdinand had been injured when he was questioned by Sky's Geoff Shreeves in his post-match interview. The Dutchman said: 'I missed the thing with Rio so I will have to look back at it but that should not really happen on a football pitch.' Rage: Fans shout and gesture as the game draws to a close after United won the Derby 3-2 . The violent scenes at the end of the Premier League fixture were in contrast to earlier in the match. According to Greater Manchester Police's (GMP) Twitter feed, there had only been one arrest by 2pm of a suspected ticket tout outside the stadium. During the game though GMP announced that another man was arrested inside the ground on suspicion of committing a racially aggravated public order offence after officers heard racist chanting. Earlier, the match commander Supt Craig Thompson said: 'I have every confidence this match will mirror the two derbies last season and the football will be the only talking point.' Wayne Rooney was also pelted with coins as he took a corner in front of City fans late in the game and, as tempers boiled over, former United player Carlos Tevez kicked out at Phil Jones right in front of United manager Sir Alex Ferguson. At the final whistle, stewards tries to prevent United's players celebrating in front of their supporters.

Fab Manchester derby for neutrals.' And football pundit Mark Lawrenson told BBC Radio Five Live: 'This is not the end we wanted to see - it was a nasty, nasty incident involving Rio Ferdinand and something thrown from the crowd.' Football fans were debating on Twitter after the final whistle whether Ferdinand had unreasonably provoked Manchester City fans in the crowd when he was hit by the coin. Arsenal supporter Sabah Chotu said: 'I know it's bad what happened to Ferdinand, but he always provokes the opposition's fans. It's in his nature. Poor attitude since he was a kid.'

United led 2-0 at the break thanks to two Wayne Rooney goals, but City drew level through Yaya Toure and Pablo Zabaleta. But Van Persie curled home a last-gasp winner.

Easing the burden: Business Minister Michael Fallon will set out measures aimed at preventing regulators from burdening small businesses . Council and quango jobsworths who regulate small businesses face a ‘bonfire of excessive red tape’ in a fresh crackdown on their box-ticking culture. Ministers want to prevent regulators from needlessly burdening businesses and stifling economic growth. They will tell the ‘men with clipboards’ to use common sense before intervening, and are planning a dramatic overhaul of their guidelines. In the future, regulators will be forced to consider whether their actions will impinge on a business’s ability to grow and be productive. The move, ordered by Business Minister Michael Fallon, may be viewed with some scepticism among business leaders, as it is the latest in a long line of desperate attempts to get heavy-handed overseers off the backs of small and medium-sized enterprises. But Mr Fallon is determined to  make a difference. He said: ‘We have started a  bonfire of excessive red tape, but I know that it is just as important that we look at the way that  regulations are enforced. ‘There is room for far more effective enforcement which reduces the burden on businesses which stick to the rules.’ Last week Chancellor George Osborne set out a ‘package of measures’ to tackle systemic problems in the way that regulations are enforced by over-zealous officials. These included forcing regulators to take into account the potential economic impact of their actions before intervening. In one example, the owner of a factory producing blue cheese was told by his council that he could not have mould on his produce. Yesterday the Government also promised to overhaul the appeals process. At the moment, if a decision is made against a business or company by its local authority, it has to appeal to the same body that made the judgment in the first place. On top of this, companies have to accept the initial judgment that they were in the wrong before they can appeal, meaning they are forced to appeal against a decision they have accepted. Businesses also say that they cannot complain openly about their local authority, for fear they will be targeted. Because they have the power to spring surprise inspections, businesses say, local regulators will ‘make their lives hell’ if they are publicly criticised. Ministers will spend a month reviewing the flaws in the system before proposing changes. Mr Fallon added that non-financial regulators, such as the Environment Agency and the Health and Safety Executive, will face a much tougher regime to cut out ‘crazy’ rulings. About 60 non-financial regulators, as well as local councils across England and Wales, will be hit by Mr Fallon’s changes. Systematic problems: George Osborne last week set out a 'package of measures' to deal with the way regulations are enforced by over-zealous officials . Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude has previously said that the Government’s ‘bonfire of the quangos’ – designed to cut down on state-backed organisations which sprung up during New Labour’s period in office – would save taxpayers £2.6billion by 2016. But the figures have been called into question by MPs on the Public Accounts Committee, who say shutting down government organisations incurs massive costs. Dr Adam Marshall, from the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ‘The Government does deserve some credit for slowing down the flow of new regulation.’ He added: ‘But only now are they starting to tackle the mountain of existing regulation that many businesses face.’","Small business regulators warned they face a 'bonfire of excessive red tape'

At first glance some of these extraordinary satellite images could be mistaken for bizarre works of modern art rather than towns and cities that are home to millions of people. From the elegant bird-shaped design of Brazil's capital Brasilia, to the circles and intricate diagonal grid pattern of downtown Washington DC - some of the greatest urban spaces on Earth look almost as distinctive from space as they do at ground level. And the ingenuity of the architects who planned and designed them through the ages, from the Renaissance to the 1960s, can still be seen today. Brasilia: The elegant bird-like design of the Brazilian capital, Brasilia has been recognised with World Heritage listed status. The city, which was built in the 1960s, is home to around four million people . With a shape that resembles a bird or even an aircraft - the Brazilian capital Brasilia is one of the most distinctive looking cities in the world. Opened in 1960 as a replacement to Brazil's former capital Rio de Janeiro, the city is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was planned and developed in 1956 with Lúcio Costa as the principal urban planner and Oscar Niemeyer the principal architect. It is one of the biggest cities in the world to be built since the beginning of the 20th Century. The impressive city is divided into numbered blocks as well as sectors for . specified activities. Canberra was chosen as a compromise . as the location for Australia's capital following a long dispute between . the country's two largest cities, Sydney and Melbourne, over which . should be given the title. Designed . by American architect Walter Burley Griffin in 1912 following a . competition - the Australian Parliament did not move in to the city . until 1927. Nicknamed the . 'Bush City,' Canberra's design was heavily influenced by the garden city . movement and features large open areas with lots of natural vegetation. Canberra: Australia's capital city has the nickname the 'Bush Capital' due to its preponderance of open spaces and natural vegetation . Palmanova: Built during the Renaissance, Palmanova in Italy is said to be the only town in the world designed to follow the ideals of a 'utopia.' Shaped like a star, it was created as a fortress to help defend the area against Ottoman attack . The ideal of the perfect city has consumed some of the world's greatest architects for generations - as shown by the intricate beauty of the town of Palmanova in Italy. Built during the Renaissance, Palmanova is said to be the only town in the world designed to follow the ideals of a 'utopia.' Designed in the shape of a star with three nine sided ring . roads, it was built . at the end of the 16th century by the once powerful Venetian Republic. It is located in the north east of Italy near the border with modern day Slovenia. It was created as a defensive settlement designed to help protect the area from the threat of Ottoman attack - which is reflected by its shape. It is now home to around 5,000 people. Built in the 1950s to house workers . at a huge copper ore factory, the tiny town of El Salvador in Chile is . one of the more unlikely examples of architectural genius on this list. At . an elevation of more than 2,400 meters in the foothills of the Andes . and in the middle of the Atacama Desert the town stands out vividly . against its remote surroundings.
