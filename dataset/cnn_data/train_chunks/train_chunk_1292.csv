"You'd be surprised if Jorge Mendes took a holiday this summer after the Portuguese super agent represented four of the biggest transfers across Europe. Forget Jose Mourinho, the Mendes XI would probably win the Premier League and Champions League in its first season, and he even represented his compatriot upon his move to Chelsea in 2004. Here's the best Jorge Mendes XI at this moment, and believe us, we could have made two world class teams, we just won't mention Bebe to Manchester United. VIDEO Scroll down for Ronaldo: Falcao and Di Maria excellent players for United . Super agent: Jorge Mendes boasts a super XI of representatives, with Jose Mourinho as manager . Manager: Jose Mourinho . Mourinho and Mendes negotiated a move to Chelsea from Porto in 2004 after the Special One had won the UEFA Cup and Champions League with the Portuguese giants. He spent three years at Chelsea, making plenty of friends and enemies before returning last summer. Path into England: Mendes helped Mourinho with his move to Chelsea from Porto in 2004 . David de Gea . After Edwin van der Sar's retirement in 2011, the Spaniard, just 20 at the time, became Manchester United's new No 1 and has remained there since. He's had his moments, but De Gea is gifted between the posts and is recognised as United's stopper for years to come. United's No 1: David de Gea moved from Atletico Madrid to Manchester United in 2011 . Pepe . The Real Madrid centre back moved from Porto to the Spanish capital in 2007 for around £24million, and has had 60 caps for Portugal since. Brazil-born, Pepe has two La Liga titles and a Champions League under his belt at the age of 31. At the back: Portugues centre back Real Madrid has had a successful career at Real Madrid . Ricardo Carvalho . With a fantastic career behind him, 36-year-old Carvalho was another of Porto's stars to move to Chelsea in 2004. He had six years at Stamford Bridge, before playing for Real Madrid and now Monaco. Leader: Ricardo Carvalho was brought to Chelsea in 2004 alongside Mourinho . Fabio Coentrao . Mendes pushed hard to get Coentrao to Manchester United on deadline day last year, but time ran out for the Portuguese duo. Coentrao is still at Real Madrid, and has 46 caps for his country. Stayed put: Real Madrid's Fabio Coentrao nearly moved to Manchester United last summer . Eliaquim Mangala . The big French centre back got his big move to Manchester City in the summer, and will learn plenty from partner Vincent Kompany at the Etihad. The 23-year-old is another from Porto, who have housed some of the world's best talents in the last decade. Force: Strong defender Eliaquim Mangala moved from Porto to the Etihad in the summer . William Carvalho . The man forever linked with a move to Manchester United, the holding midfielder is still at Sporting having spent his youth career around Portugal. Carvalho is still at the Portuguese club, but surely a move is on the cards in January. Big man: It is only a matter of time before William Carvalho appears in one of the top leagues . Joao Moutinho . Moutinho cost Monaco £20million last summer, and is one of few big-money players left at the French club after a summer cull. With 71 caps at the age of 27, the midfielder was another of Mendes' men from Porto. Slide: The Portuguese midfielder (left) is still at Monaco having moved alongside James Rodriguez last year . James Rodriguez . Moutinho moved to Monaco with Rodriguez last summer for a combined £56million, but even moneybags Mendes may not have predicted the Colombian would be the hottest property in the world after a superb World Cup. He moved to Real Madrid in July for £64million. Super signing: Rodriguez got his second big-money move in the summer, to Real Madrid from Monaco . Angel di Maria . Despite helping Real Madrid win the Champions League last season, the Argentine was soon on his way to the Premier League with Manchester United. A £60million move represented a British record fee, and Mendes' influence in the Premier League was about to get even bigger... Step down? Di Maria helped Real win the Champions League, but has ended up with United, out of Europe . Cristiano Ronaldo . Mendes supposedly spotted Ronaldo at a youth tournament, and the rest is history. The former Manchester United man won the Balon d'Or last season, and has been nothing but a joy to watch since bursting onto the scene over a decade ago. A superstar, and rightly considered the best player in the world at the moment. Superstar: Cristiano Ronaldo won the Balon d'Or ahead of Lionel Messi last year . Radamel Falcao . The Colombian wasn't able to impress at the World Cup through injury, but a big-money loan move to Manchester United means the former Porto and Atletico man can showcase his talent on a bigger stage than the French Ligue 1 with Monaco. Mendes has dealt with United plenty of times now, with Bebe, Nani, Carlos Quieroz and Anderson all represented by him.

"By her own admission Emma Watson has always been attracted to unassuming types. Hollywood stars who have asked her out have been dismissed in her withering estimation as ‘difficult and really superficial’. Much like her Harry Potter alter ego, the imperious Hermione Granger, she seems to have little time for conceit. So there may be some surprise at her current suitor — Matt Janney, a hunky 21-year-old star of Oxford University’s rugby team, who has a  reputation as something of a Lothario. Pictured in the Mail this week naked in a bath clutching a Varsity trophy, he seems an unlikely match for the elegant and refined Miss Watson, who has previously been open about her desire for a quiet life away from the hubbub of the red carpet. Emma Watson's current suitor Matt Janney, 21, has a reputation as something of a Lothario . The couple are holidaying at a five-star resort in the Caribbean, and have been very affectionate with each other as they relax on the beach. So how has Matt won Emma over? ‘Once you know his back story their relationship makes a lot more sense,’ a friend of Emma’s told me this week. ‘Matt’s not the least bit fazed by her celebrity because that world’s pretty normal for him. ‘The fact is he’s come through so much in his life already. His head won’t be turned by a famous face, whether it’s Emma’s or anyone else’s for that matter. ‘He’s seriously clever, extremely self-assured and has no desire to work in showbusiness himself. For the first time in her life, Emma’s found a guy who ticks all the boxes. He may be the one.’ In which case, he will be unlike all his predecessors. At 23, Emma has ended every relationship to date because of the demands of combining her studies with a highly successful acting career. She has studied  at both Oxford and Brown University in the U.S.. Her most recent boyfriend, an American student called William Adamowicz who she also met at Oxford, was discreetly dropped at the end of the summer. Like another old flame, financier Jay Barrymore, he failed to hold her attention. Her more exciting boyfriends, actors Johnny Simmons and Rafael Cebrian, and rock singer George Craig, were found lacking in intellectual rigour. Quite a quandary, yet one which Matt seems to have resolved. He and Emma got together last October after she watched him star for Oxford’s rugby team in a game against the Russian national side. The couple are holidaying at a five-star resort in the Caribbean, and have been very affectionate with each other as they relax on the beach . The pair were introduced at a function after the match and hit it off. Since then he has been spending much of his time at Emma’s house, just outside Oxford, and took her as his date to the party following his team’s victory in the Varsity match against Cambridge. As one fellow student puts it: ‘To take her as his date means he is  serious about her, as you wouldn’t normally take someone who is just a friend to such an event.’ Not only is Matt a dashing sportsman, he is widely admired as one of the best-looking men at Oxford. He is fluent in three languages (he is reading French and Russian at Oriel college). And he keeps famous company. The Mail has learned that Matt’s sister, Jemima, 23, is in a long-term relationship with Ben Lovett, one of the founders of rock band Mumford & Sons. The band’s lead singer,  Marcus Mumford, is married to actress Carey Mulligan. Jemima and Ben, who live together in New York, are close friends with both Carey and Keira Knightley. It is a group in which the gifted Emma would obviously move with ease. There is one obstacle: Matt’s reputation as a ladykiller. According to the Twitter musings of one of his Oxford rugby pals, an  Australian named Karl Outen, he has a reputation of ‘getting to know’ female students. Mr Outen tweeted Matt in April 2012, and said: ‘Rumours flying round the nest’ that you ‘got to know a fellow student’ last night. He then posted the rather ungentlemanly tagline ‘another notch on the bedpost’. Emma’s fans have rallied in response, deluging Matt with Twitter messages warning him not to break her heart. Yet, contrary to prurient locker- room gossip, friends maintain young Matthew is anything but a cad.They say, his ebullient demeanour belies what has been an incredibly challenging childhood. ‘Matt’s a remarkable guy all right, but I’d never describe him as a “notch on the bedpost” kind of person,’ says Mike Somerville, a friend from his teenage years living in Barnes, South-West London. ‘He was always more interested in his rugby than women. Not to say he wasn’t popular with the girls, it’s  just that he didn’t have that kind  of attitude. ‘He hasn’t been dealt the easiest hand in life, but you wouldn’t know it if you met him. He’s the kind of bloke who makes his success look more straightforward than it has been. But he’s definitely not the type to sleep around. I’ve never heard anyone talk about him that way. He’s been through so much, there’s no way he would be so superficial.’ To describe Matt’s life story as heartbreaking would not be an exaggeration. In fact, it is the stuff of tragic novels. Raised in the leafy London borough of Richmond with his sister, known to the family as Mima, two years his senior, his father David died at the age of 42 from leukaemia in 1995 when Matt was still a toddler. Their mother, Jill, a senior lawyer at City law firm Freshfields, raised them alone. Inspired by her experiences, she wrote a successful children’s book aimed at helping parents to explain bereavement to their children which is still in print today. Pictured naked in a bath clutching a trophy, he seems an unlikely match for elegant and refined Miss Watson . To describe Matt's life story as heartbreaking would not be an exaggeration - it is the stuff of tragic novels . Somehow she managed to combine a highly successful career (she became a lecturer at the College of Law in London) with motherhood. Lucy Ellis, a friend since they studied together at Cambridge in the early Eighties, describes her as having a ‘creative and analytical mind’ combined with a ‘natural glamour’. When the children were in their teens, however, she too was diagnosed with breast cancer. She died in early 2008 when Matt was 16 and before she had even turned 50, just weeks after taking her children for a last holiday in the Caribbean. Orphaned, Matt moved in with family friends to complete his sixth form at £18,900-a-year King’s College School, Wimbledon, where he excelled both in the classroom and the sport’s field. He was made the school’s  captain in his final year. On leaving school he moved in  with his sister to a Shepherd’s Bush  terrace house. Yet the siblings — who are extremely close — have since enjoyed lives which are anything  but ordinary. Matt made a seamless transition to Oxford, via internships with an investment bank and Freshfields,  following a stint coaching youth rugby in Argentina. He spent last year in Russia,  studying in the city of Yaroslavl, where he played fly half for the semi-professional rugby side. His sister, meanwhile, has had a meteoric rise as a fashion designer. She studied medicine, but dropped out to pursue her interest in design. A spokesman for Miss Watson said: 'We do not comment on speculation regarding our clients' private lives' She designed costumes for  Keira Knightley in the Kenneth  Branagh-directed thriller Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, due for release later this year. In the background, throughout, was Jemima’s relationship with Ben Lovett. A fellow King’s College  alumnus, Ben, 27, has been touring the globe for the past five years with Mumford & Sons. Through him, Jemima and Matt have got to know a wide circle of stars. Last year, Jemima set up home in Brooklyn with Ben, where she has launched her own fashion brand and Matt enjoys guest-list status at Mumford gigs. Having already endured such loss in his life, the rock ’n’ roll lifestyle has obviously failed to seduce him. His principal outlet is sport. At Oxford he enjoys a certain exclusive status which comes with being a rugby blue. ‘They are seen as elite sportsmen who attract good-looking girls,’ says a contemporary who knows the couple. ‘Emma and Matt move in the same circles, but they are a very private couple. They spend a lot of time after the rugby matches at the bar in the Pavilion.’ How different a scenario from last year, when rumours were rife that she would soon be engaged to American heir Will Adamowicz, also 23. But she quietly dumped him after he became embroiled in a drugs scandal. Pictures uploaded to a friend’s Facebook page show him at a New Year’s Eve party in front of six white scrunched-up paper packets on a table bearing the distinct traces of  white powder. He denied the packages contained drugs, saying it was scraps of paper and flour from a loaf at a dinner they had just finished. A spokesman for Miss Watson said: ‘We do not comment on speculation regarding our clients’ private lives.’ Now the girl for whom fame proved so trying seems content with her dashing rugby star whose challenges have been greater than her own. Perhaps in each other they have finally found the perfect match.

"Freak accident: Sara Bean, 34 (pictured), died Thursday after being hit in the head by falling debris from a 140-year-old church . A woman was walking to lunch with her fiancé on Thursday when she was fatally struck by a piece of falling debris from a historic south Chicago church. Sara Bean was waiting with her boyfriend at the corner of Michigan Ave and Cullerton Street when a stone piece fell off the Second Presbyterian Church's tower, clipping a gargoyle's head on the way down three stories. The 34-year-old mother was hit in the head with one of the falling objects, at the church just across the street from her house. Witness Broderick Adams told WLS that the stone split open Bean's head from front to back. He knew then that she couldn't be saved. 'The guy [her fiancé] was screaming hysterically, so I was basically trying to get to him and calm him down a little bit because I knew I couldn't do much for her,' Adams said. Bean was rushed to the hospital where she was later pronounced dead. She leaves behind two sons, ages 10 and 14, and her fiancé who she was set to marry later this year. Her brother Michael Willis has vowed to find how the freak accident happened. 'I'm trying to find answers why. Why did this happen?' Willis told DNAinfo. 'I know this could have been prevented...It could have happened to if not my sister, somebody else.' The Second Presbyterian Church is inspected every year, and has passed the inspections in recent years. However, in 2011, the 140-year-old building was cited for a violation that was later overturned. The church built in 1847 was made a landmark last year. Scroll down for video . Out of nowhere: Bean was walking with her fiancé to get lunch on Thursday when a part of the Second Presbyterian Church's tower broke off, clipped a Gargoyle's head, with both pieces of stone crashing three stories to the ground. It's unclear which fragment proved fatal for Bean . Chipped: Bean leaves behind two sons, 10 and 14, and her fiancé who she was set to wed later this year. Above, the gargoyle that was broken off in the incident . Rev Robert C Reynolds, executive Presbyter of the Presbytery of Chicago, issued a statement of apology today to Bean's family. 'We're devastated by the death of this woman and the fact that it is a function of some of the masonry at the Second Presbyterian Church,' he said. 'My prayers go out to that woman and her family.' According to Willis, his sister bean worked as a nurse's aid at Lurie Children's Hospital. She was scheduled to work Thursday night. She was one of five siblings, and has lived in the neighborhood for years, passing the corner 'millions of times'.

"Alexis Sanchez's confidence is suffering because he is not yet fully fit, according to Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger. The £30million summer signing, who arrived from Barcelona after the World Cup, started up-front for the Gunners against Everton but was withdrawn at half-time after a lacklustre display. Sanchez is likely to lead the line against Besiktas in next week's Champions League play-off second leg, but Wenger has admitted that he had no option but to substitute him at Goodison Park.

"The Department of . Justice is expected not to charge Darren Wilson, the officer whose killing of unarmed teenager Mike Brown led to protests in Ferguson and throughout the country, CNN reports. The outlet said Justice Department officials are, however, planning to sue the Ferguson Police Department for racially discriminatory practices unless the department agrees to make changes. The shooting of Brown became one of the focal points in the debate over unjust policing in the United States and led to a federal probe of both the incident and the Ferguson police department. Lawsuit: Eric Holder's Justice Department is expected not to charge Darren Wilson, the officer whose killing of unarmed teenager Mike Brown led to protests in Ferguson and throughout the country, CNN reports . After a St Louis County grand jury decided not to indict and Missouri authorities concluded an investigation without recommending charges, the federal probe is the only remaining investigation probing whether to charge Wilson. Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr did not provide a comment for the CNN report. Attorney General Eric Holder said earlier this week at a National Press Club event he is 'confident' there will be a decision before the nominee to be his replacement, Loretta Lynch, is confirmed by the Senate. The discriminatory tactics under review by the department include the department's alleged targeting and jailing of minorities for traffic violations. The St Louis Post-Dispatch reported that former St Louis County Police Chief Tim Fitch believes the Justice Department will make a civil rights lawsuit a 'consolation prize' when it clears Wilson of charges. The department insists that both investigations 'continue to be conducted separate of each other,' according to spokeswoman Dena Iverson. Outrage: The shooting of Brown occurred the same year that accusations of police brutality were brought against the officers who killed unarmed black men such as Eric Garner and Akai Gurley . Protests: The narrative around the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown became contested, with some witnesses saying he was kneeling and holding his hands up, others claiming he charged the officer . According to a civil suit already filed against both Ferguson and nearby Jennings, residents who had outstanding fines for traffic tickets and other minor offenses were thrown in 'debtors' prisons.' MSNBC reported that over the last several years, police stopped black motorists at twice the rate of white motorists in Ferguson, though whites were more likely to be in possession of contraband. 'Many towns in our region attempt to squeeze every dollar possible out of defendants and their families by jailing citizens who are not criminals,' said Thomas Harvey, executive director of ArchCity Defenders, who brought the suit on behalf of 15 plaintiffs. 'Although these practices are not new, many in the region just recently became aware of the ways in which municipal courts make people poor and keep them poor, especially in communities of color.' The report did not go into further details about the pattern of abuses alleged in the Department of Justice lawsuit. CNN did say that the agency would impose court supervision of the Ferguson Police Department in order to ensure changes were carried out.","CNN reports attorneys for the department are preparing a lawsuit against the Ferguson Police Department .

"The Collegiate Reformed Church, under the shadow of the Empire State building: Less than 50 per cent of Americans are Prostestant, according to Pew . For the first time in its history, the United States does not have a Protestant majority, according to a new study. The rising numbers of Americans with no religious affiliation is on the rise, which led to the percentage of Protestant adults in the U.S. reaching a new low of 48 per cent. This is the first time that Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life has reported with certainty that the number has fallen below 50 per cent. The drop has long been anticipated and comes at a time when there no Protestants are on the U.S. Supreme Court, and the Republicans have their first presidential ticket with no Protestant nominees. Among the reasons for the change are the growth in nondenominational Christians who can no longer be categorised as Protestant, and a spike in the number of American adults who say they have no religion. The Pew study, released Tuesday, found that about 20 per cent of Americans say they have no religious affiliation, an increase from 15 per cent in the last five years. Scholars have long debated whether people who say they no longer belong to a religious group should be considered secular. While the category as defined by Pew researchers includes atheists, it also encompasses majorities of people who say they believe in God, and a notable minority who pray daily or consider themselves 'spiritual' but not 'religious'. Still, Pew found overall that most of the unaffiliated aren't actively seeking another religious home, indicating that their ties with organised religion are permanently broken. Changing times: America's religious make-up has changed greatly in the 400 years since the Pilgrims first arrived on the Mayflower . From 1972 to 2010: The Pew Report shows how the Protestant faith has declined in the U.S. over 40 years . The research shows that religion is declining among the younger generation . Growth among those with no religion has been a major preoccupation of American faith leaders who worry that the United States, a highly religious country, would go the way of Western Europe, where church attendance has plummeted. Pope Benedict XVI has partly dedicated . his pontificate to combating secularism in the West. This week in Rome, . he is convening a three-week synod, or assembly, of bishops from around . the world aimed at bringing back Roman Catholics who have left the . church. The trend also has political implications. American voters who describe themselves as having no religion vote overwhelmingly for Democrats. Pew . found Americans with no religion support abortion rights and gay . marriage at a much higher-rate than the U.S. public at large. These . 'nones' are an increasing segment of voters who are registered as . Democrats or lean toward the party, growing from 17 per cent to 24 per . cent over the last five years. The . religiously unaffiliated are becoming as important a constituency to . Democrats as evangelicals are to Republicans, Pew said. Five years of changing beliefs: Atheism and agnosticism is growing at the expense of Christianity . Cathedral Bari in Puglia, Italy: Church buildings are a staple of European life, but attendances are plummeting . No Republican nominees are Protestant: Republican nominee Mitt Romney, for example, is Mormon . Neither agnostic or atheist: The rise of the 'nothing in particular' The Pew analysis, conducted with PBS' 'Religion & Ethics Newsweekly', is based on several surveys, including a poll of nearly 3,000 adults conducted June 28-July 9, 2012. The finding on the Protestant majority is based on responses from a larger group of more than 17,000 people and has a margin of error of plus or minus 0.9 percentage points, Pew researchers said. Pew said it had also previously calculated a drop slightly below 50 percent among U.S. Protestants, but those findings had fallen within the margin of error. The General Social Survey, which is conducted by the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center, reported for 2010 that the percentage of U.S. Protestants was around 46.7 percent. Researchers have been struggling for decades to find a definitive reason for the steady rise in those with no religion.' The spread of secularism in Western . Europe was often viewed as a byproduct of growing wealth in the region. Yet among industrialised nations, the United States stood out for its . deep religiosity in the face of increasing wealth. Mormons attend a service: America may see its first President hailing from this faith if Republican Mitt Romney wins the election . Now, . religion scholars say the decreased religiosity in the United States . could reflect a change in how Americans describe their religious lives. Arkansas, Oklahoma and Tennessee (in black) are the most Protestant states, according to the studies . In . 2007, 60 percent of people who said they seldom or never attend . religious services still identified themselves as part of a particular . religious tradition. In 2012, that statistic fell to 50 percent, . according to the Pew report. 'Part of what's going on here is that the stigma associated with not being part of any religious community has declined,' said John Green, a specialist in religion and politics at the University of Akron, who advised Pew on the survey. 'In some parts of the country, there is still a stigma. But overall, it's not the way it used to be.' The . Pew study has found the growth in unaffiliated Americans spans a broad . range of groups: men and women, college graduates and those without a . college degree, people earning less than $30,000 annually and those . earning $75,000 or more. However, . along ethnic lines, the largest jump in 'nones' has been among whites. One-fifth of whites describe themselves as having no religion. More . growth in 'nones' is expected. One-third of adults under age 30 have no . religious affiliation, compared to nine  per cent of people 65 and . older. Pew researchers wrote . that 'young adults today are much more likely to be unaffiliated than . previous generations were at a similar stage in their lives', and aren't . expected to become more religiously active as they age.","Protestants drop to 48% for the first time in American history .

"ISIS is planning to hack western TV channels and infiltrate the Russian version of Facebook to ensure its propaganda strategy is still spread online to would-be members. Several users peddling the Islamic State message had their social network accounts suspended this week, in the wake of the horrific video showing the murder of US journalist James Foley. YouTube and Twitter were among the social network sites which announced it would suspend any accounts of those who played a part in circulating the video. Scroll down for video . ISIS might have had several of its groups and accounts shut down on more mainstream social media sites - but it has now reverted to Vkontakte, the second largest social network site in Europe, in a bid to keep spreading its message . Since then, ISIS - which spreads its message through a heavy social media presence - has been forced to come up with a new strategy to counter the suspension of accounts. According to Vocativ.com, the organisation has published a five-point plan on one of its official forums, guiding users about how to continue sharing the ISIS message online. The first prong of their alternative plan is to redirect supports of the Islamic State to social networks other than Twitter. The members are also being encouraged to upload videos onto other sites other than YouTube. ISIS appears to have alreadu turned to VKontakte, the second . largest social network service in Europe, which is particularly popular . among Russian speakers. Twitter CEO Dick Costolo announced  that the site would suspend any accounts which shared the horrific video of the murder of James Foley . Al-Hayat, . the official media wing of ISIS, yesterday launched a page on the site, which has already more than 270 followers. The video of Foley’s murder, as well as several other gruesome photos, are published on the group. Other users have attempted to set up pages on the site under the ISIS banner, but several have been 'suspended due to calls to violent actions', according to the website. The five-stage plan also describes how users should hack into and disrupt Western television channels, as well as build an alternative server to support the publications of the Islamic State. The message also says that ISIS members should find an alternative site to JustPaste - a site which unwittingly became a crucial tool in ISIS's propoganda. The site allowed users to post material, without having to register online. But that site has also issued a recent crackdown on ISIS members. The group has also attempted to set-up on Diaspora, a 'community-run' network with no central server. Although the site’s founders said they were struggling to stop the growing number of ISIS supporters promoting activities on the site, all accounts promoted in the ISIS forums appear to have already been shut down. The plan has come since Wednesday's announcement from Twitter CEO Dick Costolo that any users who shared the graphic images of Mr . Foley's beheading would have their account suspended. Several ISIS accounts on Twitter and YouTube were suspended after the video of James Foley's murder was circulated. The group has now come up with a five-prong plan to get around the bans . YouTube . also announced it would shut down any account registered by a member of . a designated foreign terrorist organisation. It also said it would remove any . videos of the murder. The . Metropolitan Police also warned that ‘viewing, downloading or . disseminating extremist material within the UK may constitute an offence . under terrorism legislation’. A Twitter campaign urged the public to remember James Foley for how he lived, not how he was murdered. Mr . Foley’s friends and colleagues have posted pictures of him at work in . Syria, and also shared some of the photographs he has taken in warzones. MailOnline has contacted Twitter, YouTube and Vkontakte for comment.","ISIS accounts suspended after sharing video of James Foley's beheading .

"A woman who swallowed a $4,000 ring as police pulled her over on suspicion of stealing it has been arrested along with another male suspect. Bryan Ford, 30, and 25-year-old Christina Schlegel were pulled over half an hour after allegedly driving off with a ring worth $4,350 from a Zales store in Orem, Utah. Staff at the store reported the crime to the police, saying the pair got away in a car with its licence plate covered in pink sticky notes. Christina Sclegel, 25, and Bryan Ford, 30, were arrested  after police say they stole a ring worth $4,350 from a Zanes store before making a getaway in a car with its licence plate covered by sticky notes . But after officers stopped the duo, they had to X-ray Schlegel in order to get the ring back after she admitted swallowing it while being chased. Ford and Schlegel allegedly made off with the item of jewelry on Friday afternoon after going into the store on the pretense of buying it. According to police an attendant at the store chased Ford into the parking lot and saw him climb into a Pontiac G6 which had the licence plate covered in pink sticky notes before driving off. Officers then spotted a vehicle matching the description half an hour later and stopped the car. Police brought a Zales employee to the scene, and when she identified Ford the pair were arrested. After leading officers on several 'wild goose chases' in search of the ring, Schlegel admitted she had swallowed it, and an X-ray showed it was lodged in her stomach (pictured) However officers could find no trace of the ring, and said they were sent on 'several wild goose chases' before Schlegel eventually admitted swallowing it. She was taken to a hospital where an x-ray revealed the precious item lodged in her stomach. Doctors then checked her over before she was sent to jail. Both Ford and Schlegel were both booked into the Utah County Jail on suspicion of felony-level theft.","Christina Schlegel, 25, and Bryan Ford, 30, arrested for felony-theft .

"Google is working on a super-fast 'quantum' computer chip as part its vision to one day have machines think like humans. The California-based group has teamed up with leading physicist John Martinis to build processors based on quantum theories. The new hire is part of a 'hardware initiative' to design and build chips operating on sub-atomic levels in ways that makes them much faster than existing processors. Google said it is working on a super-fast 'quantum' computer chip as part a vision to one day have machines think like humans. Pictured is Google CEO Larry Page . Standard computers deal with binary data expressed in zeroes and ones. However, quantum computing uses the behaviour of sub-atomic particles to encode data. Experts believe that a quantum bit, which can have two states at the same time, may be able hugely improve the speed and power of computing. Professor Martinis currently works at University of California, Santa Barbara, and is one of the most prolific researchers in the area of artificial intelligence. His work with the company will be undertaken at the Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab, a collaboration between Google, Nasa and the Universities Space Research Association (USRA). 'With an integrated hardware group, the Quantum AI team will now be able to implement and test new designs for quantum optimisation and inference processors,' Google's director of engineering, Hartmut Neven, said on its research blog. Google, which is working on projects including self-driving cars and robots, has become increasingly focused on artificial intelligence in recent years. In January, the company acquired privately held artificial intelligence company DeepMind Technologies.

His company has yet to produce anything commercially but Google still paid £242 million ($399 million) for its expertise in the pioneering field of artificial intelligence. The website states DeepMind uses ‘the best techniques from machine learning and systems neuroscience to build powerful general-purpose learning algorithms.’ Another of its founders, Shane Leg, warned artificial intelligence is 'number one risk for this century,' and believes it could play a part in human extinction. 'Eventually, I think human extinction will probably occur, and technology will likely play a part in this,' DeepMind’s Shane Legg said in a recent interview. Google has now set up an ethics board to oversee its work in artificial intelligence. Elon Musk is one of the driving forces behind super-intelligent computers that could improve everything from space travel to electric cars. But the Tesla-founder claims the technology could someday be more harmful than nuclear weapons. Last month, the billionaire tweeted a recommendation for a book that looks at a robot uprising, claiming ‘We need to be super careful with AI. Potentially more dangerous than nukes.’ Musk referred to the book ‘Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies’, a work by Nick Bostrom that asks major questions about how humanity will cope with super-intelligent computers. Mr Bostrom has also argued that the world is fake and we are living in a computer simulation. In a later tweet, Musk wrote: ‘Hope we're not just the biological boot loader for digital superintelligence. Unfortunately, that is increasingly probable.’ Musk's tweets follows a similar comment in June in which the Tesla-founder said believes that a horrific ‘Terminator-like’ scenario could be created from research into artificial intelligence. The 42-year-old is so worried, he is investing in AI companies, not to make money, but to keep an eye on the technology in case it gets out of hand.

"Coffee and sleep are top of most people’s minds as they stumble through the Monday morning commute. But now tired workers up and down the country no longer have to choose between the two. In fact, drinking coffee 20 minutes or less before you wake could make you more alert after your nap. Dubbed the ‘coffee nap’, researchers claim that a cup of coffee before a quick power nap heightens the impact of caffeine on the brain. Dubbed the ‘coffee nap’, researchers claim that drinking coffee then having a quick power nap heightens the impact of caffeine on the brain . When someone drinks coffee, caffeine is absorbed through the small intestine and passes into the bloodstream, according to a report by Joseph Stromberg in Vox. Here, it crosses into the brain where it locks into receptors that are normally filled by a similarly-shaped molecule, called adenosine. Adenosine is what is responsible for natural tiredness. When it binds to receptors, it causes drowsiness by slowing down nerve cell activity.

A separate study found coffee naps can help people go for long periods without proper sleep. In one experiment, 24 young men went without proper sleep for a 24-hour period, taking only short naps. The half who had coffee naps performed better in tests that the other half who were given a placebo before their naps.","Studies in Japan and Loughborough say coffee naps improve memory .

"A boy of three went into toxic shock after a holiday henna tattoo left him struggling to breathe in a hospital burns unit. Ellis Burke's arm started reacting to the black henna Spiderman tattoo almost immediately after having it done while in Marbella, Spain. Days later back in Oldham, Greater Manchester, he began struggling to breathe, had a high temperature and started vomiting so his worried parents called an ambulance. Ellis Burke had a Spiderman black henna tattoo while on holiday in Marbella, Spain. His arm started reacting  almost immediately . He was taken to the Royal Oldham Hospital and later discharged. But the next day when he was no better his mum took him to the Oldham Integrated Care Centre where they diagnosed severe toxic shock and immediately sent him to the children's burns unit at Manchester Royal Infirmary. Ellis was forced to spend the night there while they stabilised his condition and cleaned up his wounds. His mother Shabana Murray says Ellis has had a terrible ordeal and she warned against anyone having the black henna tattoo which contains a chemical called para-phenylenediamine (PPD) and sometimes even kerosene or petrol. 'As soon as he had it done it started to react so we washed his arm in the sea but it made no difference,' said Shabana, from Middleton Road, Chadderton. 'The next day it started to blister so we went to the pharmacy and got some anti-allergy medication but it just got worse and worse. Ellis Murray, three, was scarred by a henna tattoo after an allergic reaction. He is pictured here with his mother Shabana Murray, from Oldham . 'As soon as we got home we went to A&E where they just prescribed antibiotics and more Piriton but they didn't clean it they just put the dressing back on. 'A few days later he just suddenly went down hill and woke up struggling to breathe and vomiting, his temperature was 39.4C when the ambulance arrived. 'But it was only at the walk-in centre they finally diagnosed toxic shock and sent him to Manchester Royal where they said they've never seen such a bad reaction. In fact they said they were going to use his case to inform other doctors of the effects of PPD.' Mrs Murray says she could never had imagined something so terrible and dangerous would have come from a temporary tattoo. 'We've been going to the same resort for the last four years and my eldest son has had it done several times at the same place by the same guy,' she said. 'In fact Ellis had one done the week before and was fine. 'People need to know about this and basically avoid having one because the consequences are serious and can be life-threatening. 'I knew nothing about this PPD until I came back and read about it online. As far as I know its use in henna tattoos is banned in this country. 'I now have to clean and dress his arm three times a day and it's likely there will be permanent scarring. 'He'll also be sensitive to anything with PPD in like hair dye so will have to be careful for the rest of his life.'","Ellis Burke's arm started reacting to the tattoo almost immediately .

"A security company selling Samsung Galaxy S3s with enhanced encryption says it has found 19 'phony cell towers' located throughout the United States. Customers using the Cryptophone 500, sold by ESD America, have detected signals from transmitters masquerading as cell towers that, if a cell phone connects to it, can track the phone's location or leave data on its operating system vulnerable to attacks. A map released by the company shows hits for these fake towers in New York City, Chicago, Dallas and Los Angeles. ESD America's CEO, Les Goldsmith, told Popular Science one tower in Nevada was found near a government facility out in the desert. Targeted: Though it is unclear who operates them, ESD America's customers found 19 'fake cell towers' throughout the US . Though it isn't clear who installed these 'towers,' devices with the ability to trick cellphones into connecting to their network have existed for decades. The Wall Street Journal reported in 2011 that the Federal Bureau of Investigations used a device known as a stingray to catch tax fraud Daniel David Rigmaiden. The Los Angeles Police Department purchased a stingray and used it to monitor 21 individuals, according to L.A. Weekly. Critics question the constitutionality of stingrays. The LAPD used the device to track burglary and murder suspects, in spite of stating the device would be used for 'regional terrorism investigations' in a grant application submitted to the Department of Homeland Security. Popular Science reports that the devices target a smartphone's 'baseband operating system,' which receives radio signals such as cellular, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. This functions together with a smartphone's more user-friendly operating system and personal data can be vulnerable on some phones where the two operating systems communicate. InfoWorld reports that developers of the Android-replacing operating system Replicant found such a vulnerability in some Samsung Galaxy phones. Detection: A screenshot from a Cryptophone 500 provided by ESD America shows the phone finding a possible dummy tower . Those worried about the false towers popping up across the map will have to ask themselves what it's worth to defend their data, as phones from Los Angeles-based ESD America - Samsung Galaxy S3s running an operating system licensed from a German technology company - cost $3,500 according to MIT Technology Review.","19 false cell towers were spotted in places like New York City, Chicago, Dallas and Los Angeles .

"A teacher has resigned after it was discovered she had rewritten her pupil's coursework to get them better grades. The unidentified woman was working at the Falconwood Academy in Bexley, south London, when she faked all of her 69 pupil's BTec science work. A whistleblower made the discovery last summer and raised the alarm with examining board Edexcel. Academy: A teacher at the Falconwood Academy in Bexley, south London, doctored her pupil's coursework . The school, part of the Harris Academy Federation, and Edexcel found the complaint was justified and the teacher was suspended, the Independent reports. She has now resigned. Carpetright mogul Lord Harris of Peckham set up the Harris Federation to take over some of the worst performing schools. Since 1990, it has taken over 27 schools in five London boroughs as well as most recently two schools in Thurrock, Essex. Multimillionaire businessman Lord Harris has donated money to the Conservative party after making his £200million fortune from his business. The Harris Federation employs around 2,000 staff and teaches 20,000 pupils at schools in Croydon, Southwark, Bexley, Merton and Bromley in London as well as in Essex. Daniel Moynihan, the federation's chief executive, said this case was down to a 'misguided' teacher. He said: 'This is the first time in all that stretch we've had anything like this. Multimillionaire: Carpetright mogul Lord Harris of Peckham set up the Harris Federation . 'We are determined that it won't happen again. The bottom line is that there was a single individual who was at best misguided in her desire to get students over the finishing line.' Sir Daniel, who is a former headteacher of the first school the federation established, added: 'The coursework submitted for a whole group of students wasn't their own. 'We're disappointed because this is a school we have taken from 17 per cent getting A* to C grades including maths and English to 61 per cent despite being surrounded by four selective grammar schools.' Harris Academy Falconwood was formerly the Westwood Secondary school and Westwood College. The federation took over the failing school in 2007 and also joined Harris Academy Greenwich to offer sixth form courses. The school is now writing to parents to explain what has happened and to offer pupils the chance to redo their coursework. All of the pupils that had their coursework rewritten by the teacher gained five A* to C passes in other subjects so the discovery has not affected the school's league table results. The Independent says it understands the fake coursework has not affected the students' plans to go on studying or start work. Harris Academy Beckenham was also under scrutiny earlier this summer after a whistleblower complained that its teachers had exaggerated coursework in the speaking and listening section of GCSE English. However in this case, exams regulator Ofqual cleared the academy of any wrongdoing. In a letter to the school, the AQA exam board said 'there was nothing heard that provided any evidence of malpractice'. Improved marks in the speaking and listening section were 'justified' the AQA said. In September, Harris Academy in Thurrock was ranked one of the best in the country.","Teacher worked at Falconwood Academy in Bexley, south London .

"A conservative Christian and mother of three from West Virginia has provoked vitriol from the left and support from the right after sharing her extreme beliefs about guns, abortion, health care and other political hot issues. Holly Fisher, who Tweets using the provocative handle Holly Hobby Lobby, has created uproar online in the wake of last week’s controversial birth control decision by the Supreme Court. To celebrate the court’s decision, Fisher posted a provocative photo online of her wearing a pro-life T-shirt, while posing in front of a Hobby Lobby store and holding a Chick-fil-A drinking cup. Look away liberals! To celebrate the Supreme Court's controversial birth control decision, Holly Fisher posted a photo of her wearing a pro-life T-shirt, while posing in front of a Hobby Lobby store and holding a Chick-fil-A drinking cup . ‘Attention Liberals: do not look at this picture. Your head will most likely explode,’ read the caption on the photo posted on July 1. The image went viral, prompting opponents of the Supreme Court’s decision in the Hobby Lobby case to post offensive responses and even make threats against Fisher. 'Isn't it funny that the people who call me fat, ugly, a whore, stupid ...  a bitch, etc. are the same ones whining about the #WarOnWomen?' she tweeted. Not content with the reaction she had generated, Fisher next posted a photo showing her standing in front of the American flag holding a gun and a copy of the Holy Bible on July 4. Not content with the reaction she had generated, Fisher  next posted a photo showing her standing in front of the American flag holding a gun and a copy of the Holy Bible on July 4 .

That means they think I'm pretty, right?' and, 'I'm not a terrorist, but my husband has killed a few. #ftw.' The wife of a military combat vet, Fisher had previously stirred up controversy on social media when she claimed that Obamacare had caused her family to lose access to her baby’s pediatric cardiologist. 'I have always been extremely conservative and passionate about my views. The last few years of the growing hate and intolerance among the ‘tolerant’ left has made me want to stand up and speak out. I saw this as a perfect opportunity to show where I stand,' she told Liberty News. I didn’t do it to try to change minds of those who disagree with me, but more so to show like-minded people that they’re not alone and it’s okay to stand up for what you believe in, even if it’s not popular right now.

"After nearly two years spent in captivity in Syria, American journalist Peter Theo Curtis finally touched down on U.S. soil Tuesday and was reunited with his family. The joyous homecoming came two days after Curtis was released by Syrian extremists who have been holding him hostage.

Tuesday two days after his release from Syria; Curtis later took a flight to Boston, where he was welcomed by his mother, Nancy (right) Curtis then took a connecting flight to Logan Airport in Boston, where he was welcomed by his mother, Nancy. ‘I have been so touched and moved, beyond all words, by the people who have come up to me today -- strangers on the airplane, the flight attendants, and most of all, my family to say welcome home,’ Peter Curtis was quoted as saying. Curtis expressed his gratitude to various U.S. officials, including Secretary of State John Kerry and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who helped secure his freedom, and to the government of Qatar for brokering a deal with his captors. ‘I'm overwhelmed with relief that this day has come and my son is standing beside me,’ Nancy Curtis said. ‘But this is a sober occasion because of the events of the past week. My heart goes out to the other families who are suffering.’ Unbreakable bond: Curtis finally got to hug his mother Nancy, Tuesday evening after arriving in Cambridge, Massachusetts, from Tel Aviv via New Jersey . So excited: Nancy Curtis, pictured Monday, said she spoke with her son Peter Theo Curtis on the phone and he was 'so excited' to be free . Mrs Curtis added to CNN outside her home that no one was in the mood to celebrate in the aftermath of the tragic death of kidnapped American journalist James Foley, who was beheaded by ISIS last week. A video of the gruesome execution was released online, sending shockwaves around the world. Speaking in an interview aired Monday morning on GMA, Nancy Curtis' face lit up as she described the first time she heard Peter's voice again. 'I spoke with him briefly yesterday, he was so excited,' she told reporter Amy Robach from her Cambridge, Massachusetts home. 'He said ""Mom, they're being so nice to me. They are putting me up in a 12 star hotel and I am drinking a beer and there are women,""' Nancy Curtis said. She also explained with a smile that there are a few things her son needs to catch up on, having been out of the loop for so long. She said he didn't even know that President Barack Obama had been reelected. He was kidnapped in October 2012. However, when the interview turned to James Foley, Mrs Curtis turned emotional. She said she sent an e-mail to Foley's mother, Diane Foley, upon learning that her own son was safe and on his way home. 'We've been through so much together,' Nancy Curtis said, tears glistening in her eyes. 'I didn't want her to hear it from the media first.' In this image made from undated video obtained by The Associated Press, which has been authenticated based on its contents and other AP reporting, Peter Theo Curtis delivers a statement at gunpoint . The U.S. citizen had been held hostage by an al-Qaida linked group in Syria since October 2012 . Mrs Curtis described in the interview how life was like while the 45-year-old was being held in Syria, and said she's still in that desperate mode despite his release. Curtis, a freelance journalist writing about the Middle East under the pen name Peter Padnos, was handed to UN representatives Sunday after being held by Jabhat al-Nusra, also known as the Nusra Front, near Aleppo for the past 22 months. 'When something like this happens you shut down you live in the present, you get through each day, each 15 minutes,' she said in snippet of the interview that aired earlier on ABC. 'I don't look back, I don't look forward. I deal with things as they come. And I'm still in that mode.' Tears: Mrs Curtis teared up when she spoke of James Foley and his parents, who have become her friends . But she had thought about the first thing she'll do when she sees him. 'I'll give him a big hug and I'll probably cry and he'll probably cry,' she said. Mrs Curtis' words come after the journalist's father, Michael Padnos, praised his son for his bravery. He said his son and others who venture into dangerous lands like Syria deserve respect for wanting to 'bear witness ... tell the truth about what's going on.' Padnos, who lives on a boat outside Paris, said in an interview with the Associated Press that the interminable search and wait for his son had been like 'hunting for bats in a dark, black cave.'","Curtis, 45, arrived in Cambridge, Massachusetts, late Tuesday after taking a flight from Tel Aviv via New Jersey .

"Olympic champion Ian Thorpe has bared his soul in an interview with British journalist Michael Parkinson. Thorpe, who will be part of Network Ten's Commonwealth Games commentary team this month, recently sat down with Parkinson to discuss his career, family and personal life. Australia's most decorated Olympian has just overcome a physical and mental battle following complications arising from shoulder surgery that almost cost him his arm. 'Are you gay?' No question was off-limits for British journalist Michael Parkinson when he sat down with former Olympic swimmer Ian Thorpe for an interview that went to air Sunday night. Superhuman! Known as the the Thorpedo during his stellar career, Thorpe smashed 22 world records and along the way won five gold, three silver and one bronze Olympic medals . Parkinson said Thorpe's decision that no question was off limits was brave and says he examines the good times and the bad of the Australian swimming legend. 'His fight against depression offers a unique insight into the darker side of celebrity and success,' Parkinson said in a statement released by Ten. 'What fascinates me most about Ian is that apart from the very beginning of his career, he never seemed to enjoy and celebrate his success. 'Ian Thorpe has always been near the top of my list to interview. 'Not many athletes can claim to be the best of all time. Ian can.' A good get! 'Ian has always been near the top of my list to interview,' Parkinson said . Parkinson is renowned for not being afraid to ask the tough and sometimes uncomfortable questions. Some of the British journalist's most memorable moments includes the time that boxer Muhammad Ali squared up to him for calling him Cassius Clay instead of by his Muslim name, and when former Spice Girl Victoria Beckham let slip her nickname for husband David was Golden Balls. Former British Primer Minister Tony Blair also spoke about the time that his father-in-law had asked permission to smoke cannabis in front of him, while his chat with Hollywood A-lister Meg Ryan made for uncomfortable viewing when she appeared moody and unresponsive and asked for the interview to be wrapped up. Straight talker: Parkinson, pictured with his wife Mary, is renowned for not being afraid to ask the tough and sometimes uncomfortable questions . Known as the the Thorpedo during his stellar career, Thorpe smashed 22 world records and along the way won five gold, three silver and one bronze Olympic medals. He has also won 11 World titles and 11 (10 gold, one silver) Commonwealth Games medals. Thorpe first retired in November, 2006, aged 24, and then made an ill-fated comeback in 2011 when he failed to make the Australian team for the 2012 London Games.

Defence said: 'We do not comment on an individual's deployment in Afghanistan.' Harry – who has been dubbed ‘the . party prince’ – was keen to return to Afghanistan after his first tour . of duty was cut short  in 2008. Scroll down for video . Back in action: Prince Harry is shown the Apache flight-line by a member of his squadron at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan, where he will be operating from during his tour of duty as a co-pilot gunner . The prince had been secretly deployed . with the Household Cavalry as a forward air controller directing . bombing strikes against insurgents for ten weeks. His time there was cut short when news of his presence was leaked on foreign websites and he was brought back to Britain. However, . Harry was so determined to do another tour of duty that he retrained as . an Apache pilot in the hope it would increase his chances of being . redeployed. Powerful: Harry wanders past the weapons that he will be using to fight the Taliban . The Queen and . Prince of Wales were fully briefed about his return to the war zone. Prince Charles was ‘immensely proud’ of his son, said St James’s Palace. The third in line has offered to take help out by carving a huge turkey to dish out to hundreds . of junior soldiers at Camp Bastion. It is a tradition for officers . to treat lower ranks to their meal on Christmas Day, but will be in . strict contrast to the lavish meal the Apache pilot has served up by . butlers every year at Sandringham with the royal family. Tough job: A serious looking Harry ducks near his Apache and then right he discusses what he will be doing with a colleague . Good to go: Harry said his goodbyes to his family this week and flew out earlier this week . After more than 18 months learning to fly one of the world's deadliest helicopters, Prince Harry will soon put his training into practice. The Apache is used in a number of roles in Afghanistan but all revolve around its devastating firepower. Harry will act as the aircraft's co-pilot gunner operating its arsenal of weapons from the front seat, while behind him will be the pilot. Missions will involve targeting the Taliban in support of ground troops who have come under attack from insurgents. With its payload of laser-guided Hellfire missiles, it can target buildings being used for cover by the Taliban, reducing them to rubble. And for enemy out in the open, the aircraft's 30mm chain gun can be controlled from the gunner's helmet-mounted display. Other missions include providing escort cover for aircraft, usually RAF Chinooks, that may be carrying troops or equipment around Afghanistan. Again its compliment of weapons, which include wing-mounted aerial rockets, will ward off Taliban attacks from the ground and if there are any salvos from enemy fighters, they will be returned with interest. The Apache can operate in most weather and at night, so can be used to gather intelligence in many conditions. A . spokesman added: ‘He [Harry] has approached the deployment with a range . of emotions like any other soldier and feels both pride and . anticipation as he deploys for a job he’s trained for, for so long. ‘Prince . Harry, like any soldier, considers it a great honour to represent his . country in Her Majesty’s Armed Forces wherever it chooses to deploy . him.’ The Prince will add some royal cheer to festive celebrations at Camp Bastion next week by serving up Christmas lunch. After his . hard work, Prince Harry will be able to sit down at the bright-decorated . trestle tables and eat with his comrades. And then after lunch he will spend Christmas Day with the Royle Family - even though he is 4,000 miles away in Afghanistan. The . BBC comedy will air in Camp Bastion via the British Forces Broadcasting . Service - and Harry is expected to watch it after his daily duties as . an Apache helicopter pilot. The 28-year-old will later have the opportunity to talk to his family on video-calling software Skype. Recently Prince Charles has admitted being wracked with worry while his . officer sons are serving on the frontline, telling families of the armed . forces 'I really do understand' during an emotional speech. The . Prince of Wales told families at a military awards evening how he had to . persuade his youngest son to write to him, but that fortunately 'he calls every now . and then.' Charles, 64, who was speaking at The Sun's Military . Awards event, held to honour the bravery of the armed forces, said: 'As . you can imagine being a parent of two boys in the armed forces, I do . share with you the worry and anxiety of not knowing the exact details of . our children's whereabouts.' Son Prince William also serves as an RAF search and rescue helicopter pilot. Walk by: The Prince will be in Afghanistan for four months and will even celebrate his birthday . Chat: The prince has been desperate to get back to Afghanistan because he wants to be treated like any other soldier . Dangerous: As another helicopter comes in to land Harry discusses what he'll be doing until the end of the year . In Prince Harry's words, the Apache attack helicopter is simply 'awesome'. Designed to hunt and destroy tanks, the fearsome Apache is capable of flying at 205mph and boasts a mix of weapons including a wing-mounted aerial rocket, Hellfire laser-guided missiles and a 30mm chain gun. Seen as the attack aircraft of choice in Afghanistan, it is heralded as one of the most important weapons systems to enter service with the Army since the tank in 1916, and is said to have significantly increased the force's operational capability. It can fly in all weathers from Arctic cold to desert heat, operate day or night, and detect, classify and prioritise up to 256 potential targets in seconds. Harry said he faced one of the biggest challenges of his life in 2010 as he prepared to embark on his training to fly the robust twin-engine, aerial weapons platform. 'It is a huge honour to have the chance to train on the Apache, which is an awesome helicopter,"" he revealed at the time. He added: 'To be honest, I think it will be one of the biggest challenges in my life so far.' The Prince completed his training in February, including a stint in the US where he learned to fire the aircraft's lethal missiles for the first time, facing dusty conditions similar to Afghanistan. This final stage of training was an eight-week intensive exercise at El Centro in the Californian desert, where much of the 1986 movie Top Gun was filmed. The aircraft is operated with two crew members - a pilot and co-pilot gunner who usually operates the weapon systems. Harry, known as Captain Wales in the Army, won a prize for being the best co-pilot gunner during his 18 months of rigorous training. The Apache is powered by two Rolls-Royce engines with built-in particle separators for desert operations. The first British Apaches, built by AgustaWestland based in Yeovil, Somerset, came into service with the Army Air Corps (AAC) in 2001 and went on to be widely used in Afghanistan. UK forces in Helmand Province have employed the aircraft to hunt and kill Taliban fighters, gather intelligence and provide cover for larger Chinook helicopters transporting troops and vital supplies. It uses night vision systems and CCD TV target trackers and is also fitted with high-tech radar and thermal imaging equipment that allows the crew of two to pinpoint targets with great accuracy even if they are hidden behind foliage. The Apache was also deployed in Libya in support of Nato operations. The helicopter was involved in a daring rescue mission in Afghanistan in January 2007, when four British servicemen strapped themselves to the outside of two Apaches to recover the body of a dead comrade in Helmand. The four marines went to the aid of Lance Corporal Mathew Ford hoping he was still alive after he went missing following an attack on a Taliban fort. They were hailed for their bravery.","Gunship co-pilot, 27, unleashed missile in October airstrike .

"Subway meals contain nearly as many calories and more salt than those from McDonald’s, according to new research. The chain may promote itself as the ‘healthy’ fast food restaurant but the new study suggests that it is not much healthier than McDonald’s, and in terms of salt it is worse. Researchers from the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) found that teenagers who bought Subway meals in America consumed nearly as many calories as those who bought a meal from McDonald’s. Subway is though to be at the healthier end of the fast food spectrum but in reality there is little difference between it an McDonalds . They believe that eating from both restaurants is likely to contribute towards overeating and obesity. ‘Every day, millions of people eat at McDonald's and Subway, the two largest fast food chains in the world,’ said Dr Lenard Lesser, who led the research. ‘With childhood obesity at record levels, we need to know the health impact of kids' choices at restaurants.’ The researchers asked 97 people aged between 12 and 21 to buy meals at McDonald's and Subway restaurants in a shopping centre in California. The participants went to each restaurant on different weekdays between 3p.m. and 5p.m., and paid for the meals with their own money. The researchers used the participants' receipts to record what each customer ate and estimated calorie counts from information on the chains' websites. The researchers found that the participants bought meals containing an average of 1,038 calories at McDonald's and an average of 955 calories at Subway. As part of Subway's 'Where Winners Eat' advertising campaign it worked with athletes including Olympic gymnast Louis Smith to promote its Eat Fresh range . ‘We found that there was no statistically significant difference between the two restaurants, and that participants ate too many calories at both,’ said Dr Lesser. The Institute of Medicine in the U.S. recommends that school lunches do not exceed 850 calories. The researchers also found that the sandwiches bought by the participants from Subway in America averaged 784 calories, compared to 572 calories at McDonald’s in the U.S. Sugary drinks from Subway contained an average of 61 calories while the McDonald’s alternatives contained an average of 151 calories. The participants consumed 102 grams of carbohydrates at Subway compared to 128 grams at McDonald's. The meals contained an average of 36 grams of sugar at Subway and 54 grams at McDonald's. Salt intake averaged 2,149 mg at Subway and 1,829 mg at McDonald's. ‘The nutrient profile at Subway was slightly healthier, but the food still contained three times the amount of salt that the Institute of Medicine recommends,’ Dr Lesser said. The authors suggested that the higher sodium content of the Subway meals likely came from the restaurant's processed meat. The researchers also accepted that there were some weaknesses in the study - they did not track the subjects' meals for the rest of the day, so it was unclear whether participants ate less at other times of the day to compensate for the excess calories. Dr Lesser recommends that McDonald's customers eliminate sugary drinks and French fries from their orders and suggests that at Subway people should opt for smaller subs and ask for less meat. As part of Subway's 'Where Winners Eat' advertising campaign it worked with athletes including Olympic gymnast Louis Smith to promote its Eat Fresh range. MailOnline has contacted Subway for a comment.","Subway meals contain 2,149mg of salt compared to 1,829mg at McDonald's .

"It may seem the natural way to soothe a tired, fractious baby. But mothers who rock their child to sleep are storing up trouble, a leading expert on infant development has warned. Lynne Murray, a professor of developmental psychology, said that babies take note of what is going on as they drop off – and come to want the same thing each time. So a baby that becomes used being held will need to be rocked in order to fall asleep in the future. Similarly, a mother who allows her baby to nod off while breastfeeding can expect to have sleepless nights ahead. Lynne Murray, a professor of developmental psychology, said that babies take note of what is going on as they drop off . The professor, who has spent more than 40 years researching child development, advises that parents study what their baby naturally does when drowsy – and make it easier for them to do it. So an infant that finds comfort in sucking its thumb could be wrapped in a sheet with its hands close to its mouth. Professor Murray, of Reading University, says that getting into such a routine early should prevent months and months of sleepless nights. She said: 'It is worth noting that when these principles are adopted before the onset of sleeping difficulties, the baby is unlikely to have more than brief periods of occasional distress. 'By contrast, if problems have already developed, and the baby then needs to give up an established habit of falling asleep, with their parent's active involvement, considerably more distress is likely to be involved. 'Once you've got a problem, it's a nightmare.  My approach has been you can avoid the problem if you understand the process right at the beginning. Professor Murray, of Reading University, says that getting into the right routine early should prevent months and months of sleepless nights (file picture) 'The basics are not rocket science.' Speaking at the launch of her book The Psychology of Babies, Professor Murray said that parents should wait until their babies are a few weeks' old and don't fall asleep instantly after feeding. They should then watch how what the child does when it becomes drowsy and capitalise on it. The professor said: 'If you notice in the very early weeks that your baby tends to get off to sleep by sucking on their fist then you can set a way to put them off to sleep when they get tired. 'Maybe wrap a thin sleep around them with their fists up to their chin so that when the baby surfaces from sleep and wants to go back they've got their fists available and they can do it for themselves without needing the parent to be there.' Other babies might become drowsy on looking at complex patterns – and so intricately detailed fabric could be put round the cot. Teddy bears and comfort blankets may also provide the necessary reassurance – with even every young infants likely to be aware of their smell or texture. The professor also advises getting babies into a routine, says that reading to a child is one of best ways of boosting its brainpower and that the first two years of life provide the foundations of everything from sociability to IQ.","Expert on infant development warns mothers are storing up trouble .

The sprawling pleasure palace which slain Libyan tyrant Muammar Gaddafi once called home is to be transformed into a family theme park, the country's tourism minister announced today. Colonel Gaddafi  lived a life of opulence and surreal fantasy within the walls of  Bab al-Aziziya while his subjects cowered under his bloodthirsty rule. But the vast site, in Tripoli, was overrun and plundered during the uprising that saw the dictator overthrown and later beaten to death by an angry mob. And soon an arena of family fun and frolics will rise from the ruins of this once lavish compound that for decades represented fear and oppression to millions of Libyans across the country. Astonishing: This teapot and teacups fairground ride was just one of sites that greeted insurgents inside Gaddafi's compound. They also found a zoo . Sofa so good: A rebel fighter poses for a photo as he sits on a two-seater couch . 'The work to clear away the rubble . from the ruins of Bab al-Aziziya, which was a black spot in Tripoli and a . source of concern for residents, has begun,' the minister told AFP. 'This space will be transformed into a . green area and an amusement park as a place of entertainment for Libyan . families,' she added. After the rebel fighters had overrun . the tyrant’s massive sprawling compound in 2011, it became the turn of . normally law-abiding Libyans to ransack and loot his properties. And . they could scarcely believe what they saw. One group of young men chose to tour . the Bab al-Aziziya compound in the dictator’s preferred mode of . transport  – the very same electric golf buggy he rode in to rest his . 72-year-old legs. Luxury: Rebel fighters and civilians stroll around the huge swimming pool . Trophy from his visit: This man carries a cup out of the Gaddafi compound while another man stands among a collection of decommissioned munitions inside the residence . Even as they made their way through the shattered buildings, they could see for themselves sufficient remnants of the bizarre Michael Jackson-style Neverland park, complete with fairground and zoo, that Gaddafi constructed in the heart of the capital city. First there were the creature comforts. In one of his palaces, expensive murals and art work hung from the walls and rooms were filled with replica 14th century furniture. Vast bathrooms with bidets and sunken baths adjoined most sleeping quarters. At the centre of the compound is the ‘House of Resistance’, Gaddafi’s former residence which was partially destroyed by a U.S. bombing raid in 1986. Now it is a mausoleum, its furniture preserved untouched for 25 years within glass casing as a reminder of the attack. If there was any morsel of sympathy to . be gleaned for Gaddafi, it was from the ghostly bedroom of his adopted . daughter Hana, who was only a few months old when she was killed in the . raid. Smashed: These glass cases protected the bed of Gaddafi's adopted daughter Hana, whose bedroom was a shrine following her death during a 1986 U.S. air strike . Trashed: Debris from reproduction furniture litters one of dictator's palaces within the compound . Ransacked: Despite rebels at the gate imploring them not to loot the palaces, many of them ignored their warnings . Debris: The looters at the compound took items including bedding, curtains and sheets, only leaving behind items they either did not want, or couldn't carry . There also appeared to . be a shrine in honour of the little girl – a set of missiles ‘hung’, . perhaps inappropriately, from the ceiling as though just fired from . American jets. The man with the golden gun: This man seized the prized weapon from Gaddafi's compound . Not far from a cluster of buildings used by Gaddafi’s family as sleeping quarters was a cinema where he would join his family to watch the latest western movies. The most outlandish sight in this whole bizarre fantasyland was the fairground in the gardens. It featured an old-fashioned carousel, with children’s seats on chains, and a roundabout decked out with a cartoon-style teapot and spinning cups for youngsters to play in. Some rebels could not resist posing for pictures in the giant teacup rides and laughing with incredulity that the dictator had taken flight from his own compound. But one could only stare in disbelief at this theme park within a warzone. He snorted: ‘Libyan children have no childhood, their lives are destroyed by Gaddafi. But his children, his family, have everything.’ As if all this wasn’t enough, Gaddafi had also used some of the estimated £300billion he has plundered from the country to build a zoo, stocked with animals supplied by fellow African dictators. Amid chaotic scenes, as snipers loyal to . Gaddafi took pot shots at the looters from high buildings around the . compound, people grabbed at anything they could get – sheets, bedding, . curtains and whatever else was once owned by Gaddafi. Vast: Almost every room in the palace had an adjoining bathroom with bidets and baths . Expensive: The walls of Gaddafi's palaces were covered in artwork and murals such as this . Rebels at the gate implored them not to pillage or destroy the palace, saying it should be kept for the Libyan people. But they could not resist stripping the compound of everything they could carry, including Gaddafi’s home cinema system, his table football games and a stereo. A boy of ten struggled under the weight of his raided booty – a replica gun, a satellite television receiver and other spoils he carried in a suitcase he had taken. A soldier yelled at him to stop, but others shouted him down, saying: ‘Let him take what he wants, it belongs to him.’ Others proudly held aloft the dictator’s ‘blingy’ artefacts, including jewellery and a gold-plated gun. They also tore down a massive Bedouin tent, where the tyrant liked to sleep during the hot summer months (and before Nato started raining bombs on his compound). It had been erected in world capitals during trade visits after supposedly renouncing violence in 2003.  While one tent was torn down, another – even bigger in scale – was set on fire and razed to the ground. Snap happy: Rebel fighters and civilians browse through Aisha Gaddafi's photo albums . Not alone: Rebels also went through the belongs of Gaddafi's daughter Aisha yesterday, as well as posing for photos inside her home . Looting: A pair of rebels go through the book cases of Aisha Gaddafi at her home in Tripoli . Say cheese! A rebel poses for a photo on an ornate chair inside Aisha Gaddafi's home . Relaxed: The rebel fighters have made themselves at home . Picture perfect: Rebel fighters take a closer look at Aisha Gaddafi's photographs . Some spat on the ground as they . entered the previously-forbidden zone, but others simply wanted to . rejoice at their symbolic victory over a man who had brutally controlled . their lives for so long. University student Nidal, 20, said: ‘I never thought I would see inside this place. I will tell my grandchildren of this day.’ Holding up one of Gaddafi’s personal photo albums, a group of women flicked through the pages of Gaddafi alongside world leaders. ‘I can’t believe we are here!’ cried Falima, 23, whose father disappeared almost a decade ago after being caught speaking out against the regime. ‘He had everything he needed – and you people, from the west, helped him stay in power until you saw sense.’ Taking a look round: This group of Tripoli residents could hardly believe their eyes when they entered Gaddafi's compound yesterday . Try these for size: These two rebels examine clothes they want which  belong to members of the dictator's family . The rebels look through photo albums belonging to family while they also took other items . But, even in defeat, Gaddafi is not finished killing. As liberated Libyans cavorted around the complex, loyalist gunmen opened fire and mortar shells rained down inside Gaddafi’s lair. Such is the vast scale of the compound . – 2.4 square miles in its entirety – that while looters were joyfully . running amok in some areas, in another part rebels were engaged all day . in a fierce gunfight with Gaddafi loyalists guarding the tunnels. As people ran for their lives, the barrage was a clear sign that the end of the war may be near, but the battles go on. Rebel fighters believe the attack was part of a deliberate strategy to prevent them from entering the 2,000-mile tunnel network Gaddafi constructed underneath his complex. Amid fears of booby traps, and with . loyal members of Gaddafi’s bodyguard unit firing from the entrances, the . rebels were last night still engaged in fierce gun battles as they . tried to follow the fleeing dictator. So where has he gone? Some . believe the tunnels lead all the way to Sirte, Gaddafi’s birthplace . stronghold 200 miles to the east, and the location of a stockpile of 200 . Scud missiles, many of them armed with chemical warheads. As . rebels fought to gain entrance to the tunnels, amid claims that . Gaddafi’s retreating forces were trying to destroy each section they . passed through to prevent any pursuit, their comrades were rushing in . armed vehicles to Sirte, hoping to catch the dictator should he come up . for air there.","Colonel Gaddafi  lived a life of opulence and surreal fantasy in the compound .

Carmitchel is to make an initial appearance at 3 p.m. Thursday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Peggy Leen. Detectives say Carmitchel robbed a casino cashier of $43,500 at gunpoint on Friday night and later paid prostitutes at another hotel with the money still bound in Bellagio wrappers. He was arrested on Saturday night. The robbery occurred at 8.30pm on Friday when a man walked up to a Bellagio cashier's cage, pulled a gun from a backpack and demanded money from a clerk, who later told police she feared she would die if she didn't co-operate. The arrest of Carmitchel came after investigators were tipped off by a tourist from Texas who said he became suspicious after a man paid him $300 to rent him a $405 room at the Hard Rock Hotel.

They . also said they found a shirt they believe was worn by the robber, a . $1,800 pair of black Louis Vuitton shoes, and an $800 Louis Vuitton . belt, along with recent shopping receipts. About half the money taken remained unaccounted for, the police report added. In his mug shot, police had to forcibly hold his head in position as he refused to co-operate in any way and was combative with officers throughout the booking process. Kansas Department of Corrections records show a Scott Alan Carmitchel served time for battery against a law officer and a robbery in 1998, and he was sent to prison most recently a year ago for making a criminal threat. He was paroled in December and the department listed him as 'absconded' with his whereabouts unknown as of May 29. Las Vegas police spelled his last name 'Carmitchell' on a booking photo released on late Tuesday.

"The devastated  wife of a former professional footballer who is battling Alzheimer’s believes he may have developed the disease after repeatedly heading a ball. Former Norwich City captain Duncan Forbes, 72, who was known for his tough tackling was diagnosed with the condition in 2007. His wife Janette, 68, was recently forced to put him into residential care because she was no longer able to look after him at their home in Thorpe St Andrew near Norwich, Norfolk. Duncan Forbes in his Norwich City heyday: His wife believes that repeatedly heading the ball has lead to his Alzheimer's disease diagnosis . She now believed that heading the ball during his 23-year playing career as a central defender contributed to his Alzheimer’s. Mrs Forbes said: 'I do not think heading footballs helped. He used to head medicine balls in training because if you could head one of those, you could head a football further - that is like being punched. Janette Forbes faced the devastating decision of moving her husband Duncan to a care home earlier this month . Heading the ball: Duncan Forbes has moved into a Norwich care home . 'Duncan had been playing since he was a kid and I don’t think he played with the really heavy leather balls with laces, but they were heavier than the ones they play with today. 'The authorities would never admit it because it would open the floodgates, but I think there are a lot of ex professional players with Alzheimer’s.'Forbes was born in Edinburgh, started his career at Colchester United and played for Norwich City for 13 years, making 295 appearances and scoring ten goals between 1968 and 1981. The father-of-two and grandfather of five was then a member of the club’s commercial staff for seven years and chief scout for another 13 years until he retired in 2001. Mrs Forbes said he started showing signs of the disease eight-years-ago when he became forgetful although his doctor said at first it simply down to him getting older. She realised something was seriously wrong when he could not remember who Norwich City had played two days earlier six-years-ago. Mrs Forbes said: 'It was a Monday morning and Norwich had played on the Saturday. I can’t remember if it was at home or away and Duncan did not know they had played. 'When he was young he would read the four divisions scores and he could tell anyone the scores after reading them once. This time he did not know that Norwich had played at all.' Mrs Forbes said she did not immediately tell friends about her husband’s condition because of the stigma surrounding dementia, and also told how she initially found it difficult to get the help and support she needed. She said: 'There was no back-up and I felt I had been cast adrift in a sea and I found that I had to find things out for myself. Norwich City and Scottish football legend Duncan Forbes . 'At first I struggled along and when we met people in the city, I prompted him about football, but eventually I had to tell people about the Alzheimer’s. Because of the stigma surrounding dementia, I did not tell people to start with, but it is not his fault. 'Duncan did not realise what Alzheimer’s was. Even if we saw a programme on television about it, he did not relate that it was the same thing he was going through. 'The last three years got really bad and we started doing less and less.' She added: 'Up until five years ago we went on holiday to see our son in Spain and we stopped going to Scotland 18 months ago because we had a problem on the plane and he wanted to get off before the plane stopped. 'I stopped taking him to the football about two years ago because it was difficult and at half time he thought it was finished. He sometimes watches the games and he can still kick a ball about, but cannot turn around when the ball goes behind him.' This week, in a bid to help others in her situation, Mrs Forbes opened a new Age UK shop and advice centre in Norwich. She hopes that it will encourage dementia sufferers and their carers to receive more support, but says that the decision to put her husband in a care home ten days ago was extremely difficult. She said: 'Some days he is better, but he has gone downhill since last Christmas. 'I think he knows who I am, but I do not know if he knows who his sons are.' She added: 'He cannot hold a conversation. In the care home he still goes up to people and shakes people’s hands and is still friendly and he was always a people person. There is still a little bit there. 'He was not a smoker and was not a big drinker and kept himself fit and healthy. If someone like him can get Alzheimer’s it could happen to anyone.' Over the past 30 years, research has . linked moderate and severe traumatic brain injury to a greater risk of . developing Alzheimer's disease or another type of dementia years after . the original head injury. Emerging evidence suggests that repeated . mild traumatic brain injuries, such as those that can occur in sports . like football and hockey, may be linked to a greater . risk of a type of dementia called chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Research has shown that boxers have an increased risk of chronic . traumatic. It is not known exactly what causes this process to begin, but people . with Alzheimer's disease have been found to have abnormal amounts of . protein and fibres in the brain. Known . risk factors in the development of the condition are old age, family . history, head injuries or whiplash and vascular disease. An inquest in 2002 heard how former West Brom and England striker Jeff . Astle (above) died aged 59 from dementia brought on by repeatedly heading the . ball. A coroner ruled that his death was industrial as the heavy . leather balls which he played with in the 1960s had caused him trauma . similar to that suffered by a boxer.

"Jamie Carragher could not contain his laughter during Sky Sports' Monday Night Football show when he was told Fabricio Coloccini was the favourite to replace Alan Pardew at Newcastle. Newcastle are on the lookout for a new boss following Pardew's move to Crystal Palace and captain Coloccini emerged as a surprise contender to take over the reins at St James' Park. The 32-year-old defender was, at the time, ahead of established managers Steve Bruce, Tony Pulis and Steve McClaren in the bookmakers' odds to replace Pardew.

Sky Sports presenter Ed Chamberlin announced: 'A bit of breaking news for you, it is Coloccini who is the favourite for the Newcastle job so far.' Carragher responded by laughing at the suggestion that Coloccini could take up such a role. The Independent suggests Newcastle owner Mike Ashley is 'ready to turn to the long-serving Argentinian club captain' after Pardew's sudden exit. However Coloccini, who has played 231 times for Newcastle since joining from Deportivo La Coruna for £10.3million in August 2008, has now drifted out. When asked who he thought Mike Ashley should appoint as manager, Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker was also dismissive of the contenders. 'Newcastle had a good manager who was under appreciated,' Lineker wrote on BreatheSport. 'This may become more apparent in time. Be careful what you wish for.' Newcastle captain Coloccini arrives at Newcastle's training ground on Tuesday morning . John Carver and Steve Stone will take caretaker charge of Newcastle's next two games following Pardew's departure to Selhurst Park.

Pardew is expected to sign a four-year deal at Crystal Palace after being given permission by Ashley, who is currently in Barbados, to begin negotiations with the south London outfit. The 53-year-old played for Palace from 1987 to 1991 during his playing days. Pardew has managed to seal a return to Palace as Eagles co-owner Steve Parish agreed to fork out £2m on securing his prime managerial target. His last game in charge of Newcastle saw the Magpies beat Everton 3-2 thanks to goals by Papiss Cisse, Ayoze Perez and Jack Colback. Newcastle United can confirm that Crystal Palace have made a formal approach requesting permission to speak to Alan Pardew in relation to their vacant managerial position. Crystal Palace have offered compensation at a level whereby Alan has now been permitted to speak to them. As a result of this development today (Monday), Alan will not be at training on Tuesday.

"The deadly Ebola virus is more likely to claim the lives of those aged 45 or older, scientists have claimed. A new study carried out in Sierra Leone - one of the West African nations worst hit during the outbreak - has produced the most complete picture to date of how the virus affects sufferers. From its discovery in the north eastern region of Zaire in 1976, the deadly virus has proved hard to track. Until the death of a two-year-old in Guinea in December last year sparked the largest outbreak in Ebola's history, there had been just 1,500 deaths during 25 outbreaks spanning 37 years. As a result, and in comparison to other deadly viruses, relatively little data on the virus existed. A new study carried out by health workers and scientists at Sierra Leone's Kenema Government Hospital, has found the fatality rate for those aged 45 or older is 94 per cent . Forty-seven doctors and nurses collated the information while caring for 106 patients at Kenema Government Hospital, pictured, in Sierra Leone - one of the nations hardest hit by the Ebola outbreak . Health workers working with the bodies of Ebola victims at Kenema Hospital in Sierra Leone . A volunteer medical team carry the body of a victim during the burial of seven people who died from Ebola in Kenema . The team's work found the younger a patient is the more likely they are to survive, fever is the most common symptom when victims first seek care, and early medical help is crucial. Pictured, health workers carry the body of a victim in Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown . The team  tasked with discovering Ebola in 1976, led by Professor Peter Piot, took detailed notes of their findings. But in the central African nations plagued by the virus there commonly lacked a standardised procedure for taking medical notes. What scientists know often came from informal doctors' notes, charting incomplete recollections of the virus' effect on patients. No medical records or charts were in place to note patients' symptoms, vital signs and treatment. The team's work found the younger a patient is the more likely they are to survive, fever is the most common symptom when victims first seek care, and early medical help is crucial. The fatality rate for patients under 21 was 57 per cent, while for those aged 45 and older, mortality soared to 94 per cent. One striking finding was how devastating the severe diarrhoea, a symptom of the disease, is for patients. The report, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, estimated the incubation period of the patients they examined was six to 12 days - similar to that seen during the outbreak. Fever was the most common symptom reported by patients with 80 per cent suffering a raised temperature, . The study found the higher the temperature recorded on admission to hospital, the more likely patients were to die from Ebola. Eighty per cent of patients suffered a headache, 66 per cent noted weakness, 60 per cent suffered dizziness, 51 per cent diarrhoea, 40 per cent abdominal pain and 34 per cent suffered vomiting. Only one patient was found to suffer internal bleeding - one of the most deadly symptoms. There was no way of recording accurate death rates. But at the Kenema Government Hospital in Sierra Leone for the last 10 years, a team of US scientists has been working with staff and the country's health department to establish a new medical records system. It was introduced to help patients suffering Lassa fever, Time reports. But when the Ebola outbreak reached Sierra Leone's third largest city in May this year, the system in place began to collate the most comprehensive set of data ever collected on the virus. The findings, published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine, have added to knowledge of the disease. According to the World Health Organisation, the virus has so far claimed almost 5,000 lives. In Sierra Leone there have been 5,235 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of the disease, of 13,703 across the world, while 1,500 people have died. Forty-seven doctors and nurses collated the information while caring for 106 patients at Kenema Government Hospital in Sierra Leone - one of the nations hardest hit by the Ebola outbreak. Seven of the health workers conducting the research died - six from Ebola, while one suffered a stroke. Among them was Dr Sheik Humarr Khan, the doctor hailed a hero by his government having led Sierra Leone's fight against the virus until his death in July.

The team's work found the younger a patient is the more likely they are to survive, fever is the most common symptom when victims first seek care, and early medical help is crucial. Dr John Schieffelin, an infectious diseases specialist at Tulane University in the US, said the findings highlight the advantage of youth. The fatality rate for patients under 21 was 57 per cent, while for those aged 45 and older, mortality soared to 94 per cent. Dr Schieffelin said: 'They're more resilient and younger and tougher. 'This is definitely the most detailed analysis of symptoms and factors related to survival,' he added. One striking finding was how devastating the severe diarrhoea, a symptom of the disease, is for patients. 'If you can keep up with simple hydration during that phase, you can prevent a lot of deaths,' Dr. Bruce Farber, chief of infectious diseases at North Shore University Hospital, New York, told CBS News. Basic supportive health care, providing intravenous fluids and nutrients, and maintaining a patient's blood pressure can be the difference between life and death.

"Up to 160 applicants are chasing each graduate vacancy at some of the country’s top companies, research published today shows. Britain’s leading graduate employers have received an average of 46 applications per post this year - up from 35 in 2008 amid ‘fierce’ competition. However, marketing and sales jobs at firms such as Unilever and Procter & Gamble have seen 160 applications per graduate job advertised. Tough job market: Marketing and sales jobs at firms such as Unilever and Procter & Gamble have seen 160 applications this year . The number of applicants per graduate post job in the media stands at 110; banking and finance, 84; oil and energy, 74; retailing, 64; public sector 49 and investment banking, 48. The new study comes as Higher Education Statistics Agency figures showed last week that more than 20,000 graduates - nine per cent - were unemployed six months after leaving university last year. There was also a doubling in the number of university-leavers taking menial jobs such as shelf stackers, garbage collectors and cleaners over the last six years, as thousands failed to land graduate jobs. Fierce competition: The new study found that more than 20,000 graduates were unemployed six months after leaving university last year . High Fliers Research surveyed 100 top graduate employers including Marks & Spencer, PwC, Rolls-Royce, Saatchi and Saatchi and Ernst & Young. Overall, vacancies for graduate jobs starting this September rose by 4.6 per cent from 16,452 in 2012 to 17,217, taking graduate recruitment to its highest level since 2008. However, a third of recruiters reduced their entry-level vacancies this year, with six cutting more than 50 graduate positions. And within nine out of 13 sectors including media and banking, graduate vacancies are lower than before the start of the recession. Low pay: The number of graduates resorting to manual work such as shelf-stacking has doubled in the last six years . This year, there were a third fewer entry-level positions at the City investment banks compared with 2007 and recruitment at the major oil and energy companies was 25 per cent lower. The worst-hit sector is the media where there are currently half the number of graduate jobs than before the economic downturn. The survey also found that three-quarters of graduate employers require applicants to have at least a 2.1 degree and a quarter specify that candidates should have a minimum Ucas tariff, based on their A-level results. More than four-fifths use some form of aptitude test such as verbal or abstract reasoning. Over a third conduct skills-based or strength-based assessments. Rude awakening: Many graduates went travelling at the start of the recession but have come back to find the job market even more competitive . The average graduate starting salary is £29,000 - the same rate paid over the last three years.Martin Birchall, managing director of High Fliers Research, said: ‘This cohort and last year are by far the most motivated graduate job hunters we’ve ever seen. ‘At the start of the recession, the reaction from many students was to avoid the job market so they went off travelling or signed up for more postgraduate studying. The realisation now is that there’s a good number of top graduate jobs available but you have to fight for them. ‘Students have been making more applications and they’ve started their job hunting earlier. On average, students apply for a minimum of seven companies and some are applying for between 20 and 50.’ HESA statistics published last week showed that 9,695 graduates - six per cent of those finding employment - took up ‘elementary occupations’ that did not require degrees after leaving university in 2011/12. This included working as bar staff, waiters and waitresses, hotel porters, couriers, mail sorters and window cleaners. This compared to the 5,460 or four cent of students who ended up in these menial jobs six months after graduating in 2006/7.","Firms such .

"Humiliated: Irum Abbassi was thrown off a Southwest Airlines flight after a flight attendant thought she heard her saying 'it's a go' A Muslim-American woman was removed from an aeroplane as it prepared for take off - after a flight attendant told security staff she heard her say 'It's a go' into her mobile phone. But U.S. citizen Irum Abbassi, who was travelling out of San Diego's International Airport, claims she actually said 'I've got to go'. The mother-of-three was quickly searched and then made her way back to the flight - but the aeroplane's crew refused to allow her back on board. She then took the next flight - and is now suing Southwest Airlines for the 'humiliating' incident. The psychology graduate student at San Jose State University filed the lawsuit in federal court in San Diego. Her lawyer James McElroy said: 'Suspicions were aroused because of her religion. She would not have been removed from the plane if she had been a blond-haired, blue-eyed woman."" Abbasi was taken off the San Jose-bound flight in March. The lawsuit said she felt 'horrified, embarrassed, humiliated and confused' by the incident. Abbasi claims she had said 'I have to go' to a Verizon representative because the aeroplane was about to depart. Abbasi was searched by Transportation Security Administration (TSA) staff and given clearance to reboard the flight within three minutes. But the pilot claimed the crew was uncomfortable flying with her and refused to allow her aboard. She was given an apology, a voucher and a boarding pass for the next San Jose flight. It meant she missed a critical research experiment that she needed to be able to complete for her graduate studies, the lawsuit added. Lawsuit: Irum Abbassi is now suing Southwest Airlines over the incident she said left her 'humiliated' Chris Mainz, spokesman for Dallas-based Southwest Airlines, said the company apologised to Abbasi for her inconvenience and her concerns were addressed 'in good faith'. He added: 'In this case, our employees raised a safety concern based on the customer's behaviour, and we had a duty to thoroughly address those concerns before clearing the customer to travel. 'We have a vast, diverse workforce, and we celebrate diversity among our employees and our customers. 'We do not discriminate against anyone for any reason, and we've been recognized as a leader for our diversity and care for all of our customers throughout our 40 years of service.' In the past Southwest has received widespread notoriety for removing passengers. In September the airline booted off a female couple who kissed during a flight. Earlier this year it also removed Green Day singer Billy Joe Armstrong and a University of New Mexico football player for wearing trousers that were too baggy. Stopped: Irum Abbassi was removed from the aeroplane at San Diego's International Airport . Abbassi is asking for punitive damages for discrimination based on race, religion, colour, ethnicity, alienage, ancestry, and/or national origin, breach of contract, negligence, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. University of Southern California counter-terrorism Professor Seth Stodder said discrimination laws for airline passengers are weighed against security concerns and sometimes just gut-level fear. He told KPBS: 'It's a hard balance to draw when you're dealing with a pilot who is making a decision based on his assessment of the safety of the passengers of the plane. 'There is no clear law. It's one of those issues that hasn't really been adequately litigated.' Edgar Hopida, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, agreed that a balance had to be struck. But he said it had to include an understanding that Muslims were also travellers who wanted to get to their destinations safely. He said: 'We're all about security because we're Americans too and we travel on the same aeroplanes as everyone else.' And he warned that, in the future, more people would be removed from airlines if flight attendants and other crew members were not reminded of that message.",U.S. citizen Irum Abbassi now suing Southwest Airlines over incident .
"A woman whose baby's foot was found stashed in the refrigerator of a 'House of Horrors' abortion clinic three years after the procedure has spoken out about her terrifying ordeal. Desiree Hawkins, who was just 16 at the time, is just one of the patients who has come forward to recount their horrifying experiences at the Women's Medical Society in Philadelphia. Women, including one who was left infertile by the treatment, have described blood-splattered floors and procedure . rooms, as well as aggressive staff who acted as if they just wanted their money. The accounts of what allegedly happened at the hands of the clinic's owner, Dr Kermit Gosnell, come as the prosecution rests in his murder trial after six weeks of testimony. Gosnell, 72, is charged with killing four infants during botched abortions as well as a 41-year-old woman who died of an overdose after a procedure. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Painful: Desiree Hawkins, a former patient of Dr Kermit Gosnell, recounts her ordeal at his abortion clinic. She said detectives called her three years later to reveal her baby's foot was found in a fridge . Now, through the 3801 Lancaster Film Project . - a collection of movies committed to exposing the horrors at the . clinic - some of the women who were treated by Gosnell have shared their . stories. Hawkins was a high school student when she learned she was pregnant and, after a clinic in Maryland found she was 19 weeks along, she was sent to Dr Gosnell for a late-term abortion. She underwent the procedure on December 4, 2009 - unaware that just 15 days before, Karnamaya Mongar had died following an abortion at the clinic. 'I remember coming to as I was laying on . the bed... having a young girl standing next to me and the only reason I . was waking up was because I kept vomiting all over myself,' Hawkins said. Last resort: When a Maryland clinic found she was 19 weeks pregnant, they gave her Gosnell's pamphlet . Disturbing: Detectives told her that her baby's foot is pictured right in this photo taken at the clinic . 'I remember him picking up something and walking out the room.' Hawkins said she struggled to come to terms with giving up her baby, but always knew she was too young to become a mother and her own mother would be unable to provide for them. No one apart from her mother knew of the abortion for three years - until she received a call from Philadelphia detectives, telling her that Dr Gosnell was being investigated for horrors at the clinic. It was then that she learned her baby's foot had been found in a fridge at the clinic. 'You don't even know how to respond when . you find a human has kept a foot of your baby,' she told the film project. 'You don't know how to . answer that. You just want to cry. You just don't want to believe it and . I still don't.' Another patient, Davida Clarke, said that she too is left with painful memories of her experience at the clinic - and claimed that, because of what happened there, she can no longer have children. Nowhere to turn: Davida Clarke said she went to the clinic after she was raped when she was younger . Alone: When Clarke, pictured, begged the staff to stop, she said Dr Gosnell shouted: 'Stop being a baby!' Clarke went to the clinic after she fell in with 'the wrong crowd' and was raped - but said she never received the caring, supportive environment she craved. 'You had a receptionist that just... all she wanted was your money immediately,' she told the film project. 'I came in... I remember walking through and looking and seeing some women who looked half dead in these bloody recliner chairs and there was blood all over the floor.' She explained that she first saw Dr Gosnell when she was attached to IVs and having doubts about the procedure. She said that she told the staff she couldn't go through with it. 'He's like, ""Oh stop being a little baby"" and he's pounding on my legs, ""Stop being a little baby! Stop being a little baby!""' she said.  'And I'm outnumbered because all these women came in and I'm tied to the bed and the next thing I knew, I was out of it.' When she came to, she began crying and begging for her baby, but was ignored, she said. Charged: Dr. Kermit Gosnell, a Philadelphia abortion doctor, is accused of killing 4 babies allegedly born alive . 'I can't have babies as a result,' she added. 'I'm married - I have a daughter that wants a brother or a sister and I can't give her that. I want a child. I can't have that.' And in yet more horrifying details, . another patient, who was only identified as Makeda, said staff at the . clinic led her to believe that abortions were a viable form of . contraception. One nurse even assured her that Brazilian women have at least 21 abortions each, she said. 'It was the norm for me after she had coached me,' she said. 'In the next 14 years I had eight abortions. I look back at it and I'm like, ""What was I thinking?""' Their stories come as prosecutors gave their closing arguments in Gosnell's trial on Monday. He is accused of cutting babies' necks with scissors to ensure their demise after botched procedures. In court, Assistant District Attorney . Ed Cameron turned to Gosnell and asked, 'Are you human?' - but the . doctor simply stared back and laughed. Tragic: He faces a murder charge in the overdose death of Karnamaya Mongar, left, who died in 2009 . 'My dog was treated better than those babies and women,' Cameron said. He added that Mongar's death was the result of Gosnell's 'assembly line' treatment of patients. The defense questioned testimony from staffers who said they had seen babies move, cry or breathe. Gosnell's defense lawyer, John McMahon, argued that each testified to seeing only a single movement or breath. 'These are not the movements of a live child,' McMahon said. 'There is not one piece - not one - of objective, scientific evidence that anyone was born alive.' But the prosecutor questioned why . else Gosnell and his staff would 'snip' babies if they were not born . alive. The brains were intact, so it was not done to make the delivery . easier, he said. Scene: A police car is seen outside the the Women's Medical Society in 2011 following Gosnell's arrest . Discarded: Bags stashed with body parts, pictured, were also found in the Philadelphia clinic . 'Why would you cut a baby in the back of the neck unless you were killing it?' Cameron argued. Former . staffers have testified that patients received heavy sedatives and . painkillers from untrained workers while Gosnell was offsite, and were . then left in waiting rooms for hours, often unattended. A . 2011 grand jury report alleges that dozens of women were injured at . Gosnell's clinic over the past 30 years, calling it a ‘house of . horrors.’ Some . left with torn wombs or bowels, some with venereal disease contracted . through the reuse of non-sterilized equipment, and some left with fetal . remains still inside them, the report alleged. Employees . at the clinic confirmed that babies were often expelled from their . mothers into the toilet. On at least one occasion the toilet had to be . removed from the floor to 'get the fetuses out of the pipes.' Operating table: Women were often given such high doses of drugs that they gave birth in the toilet . No escape: Mongar allegedly died after staff had been unable to open this side door for an hour . And . in a 300-page grand jury report, that initially laid out the charges . against Gosnell, details the appalling conditions of the West . Philadelphia clinic the doctor operated. It . was described as reeking of cat urine, with walls splattered with blood . and patient rooms filled with unsanitary instruments and broken- down . equipment. The . tiny fetuses and many of their bodyparts were piled high throughout . Gosnell’s clinic in cabinets and freezers, in plastic bags, bottles, . even cat-food containers. Jars with severed feet lined shelves, prosecutors said. 'It was a baby charnel house,' the grand jury report said. Gosnell . has been in jail since his January 2011 arrest. Eight other defendants . have pleaded guilty to a variety of charges and are awaiting sentencing.","Dr Kermit Gosnell on trial for deaths of four babies and one woman .

"Living a healthy lifestyle could delay dementia by up to 12 years, according to a landmark UK study. Heart disease could also be staved off by around six years compared with those who neglect their diet and exercise, said the health specialists. The project tracking the lives of 2,500 men for 35 years pinpointed five steps in leading a long and disease-free life which mirror growing evidence about the benefits of healthy living. They are: taking regular exercise, not smoking, having a healthy bodyweight, eating a good diet and having a low alcohol intake. The study in South Wales is the longest of its kind to examine the influence of environmental factors in chronic disease. From 1979 to the present day, researchers from Cardiff University followed the lifestyle habits of men aged 45-59 living in the Caerphilly area. A landmark study carried out in South Wales over 35 years found living a healthy lifestyle could delay dementia by up to 12 years, while heart disease could be staved off by six years. File picture . They found that those who followed four or five of the specified healthy steps were 60 per cent less likely to develop dementia. There was a similar reduction in the risk of heart attacks and strokes, along with 40 per cent fewer cancers. There was also a 70 per cent cut in the risk of diabetes, according to evidence presented yesterday at a Healthy Ageing summit run by the university. Professor Peter Elwood, who has led the School of Medicine study since its inception, said the findings were a ‘wake-up’ call. ‘Thirty years ago, only 30 men in our study followed all five of our recommended healthy steps,’ he said. ‘Although following these steps does not give them complete protection against disease, the men who, despite living healthily, developed a disease did so at a much older age than the men neglectful of their lifestyle. ‘Thus the development of heart disease was delayed by up to six years and it was up to around an additional 12 years before dementia took its grip. ‘On the less rosy end of the spectrum, 40 men in every 100 lived a life so neglectful that by any definition their lifestyle was unhealthy. They experienced none of the reductions in disease.’ He added: ‘The appalling fact is that recent surveys across the whole of Wales yield almost identical proportions of men and women following the healthy and unhealthy lifestyles found in Caerphilly 35 years ago. 'And the picture isn’t much better in England: 53 per cent of men drink more than the recommended amount and only half of men meet the government-recommended scores for well-being.’ Researchers examined a group of 2,500 men, starting in 1979. They encourage the participants to take regular exercise, maintain a healthy body weight and refrain from smoking. File picture . The men taking part were also asked to eat a healthy diet and keep their alcohol intake to a minimum . The advice given by the project has become familiar from other research showing that staying slim, eating lots of fruit and vegetables, exercising regularly, drinking in moderation and never smoking boosts longevity. The Caerphilly participants come from a community where consumption of fruit and vegetables was low, so three or more portions a day was accepted as ‘healthy’. Fat making up less than 30 per cent of calories was classed as a good diet. Those regarded as physically active were walking two or more miles or cycling ten or more to work each day, or taking ‘vigorous’ exercise regularly. Low alcohol consumption was defined as three or fewer units per day, with abstinence not treated as healthy behaviour. Clare Walton, of the Alzheimer’s Society which part-funded the project, said: ‘These studies are expensive and complicated but essential to understand how dementia can be prevented.’ The Caerphilly research was a pilot for the much larger UK BIOBANK study involving more than 500,000 Britons. This is led by Professor John Gallacher, who also works at Cardiff.","Landmark UK study tracked the lives of 2,500 men for 35 years .

"When Matthew Hawksley made it to the finish line of the triathlon at Mullaghmore, Co Sligo, Ireland, it was the the final victory in a a fight for life that began in that very town three years earlier. For in the same chilly North Atlantic waters that the 26-year-old raced rival athletes, he had in 2011 broken his neck after diving from a 15ft pier into water just 3 feet deep. But that was just the start of a journey that saw him cheat death eight times and fight his way back from what doctors told him would be a lifetime of paralysis. You saved my life: Matthew Hawksley meets Fiona Hillary for the first time since she resuscitated him eight times after he leapt from a 15ft pier into just three feet of water and broke his neck in Mullaghmore, Co Sligo . 'I am incredibly proud that I got back here': Mr Hawksley and Ms Hillary were introduced as they prepared for the swimming leg of a triathlon in the very same waters where he nearly lost his life three years ago . Mr Hawksley spent five weeks in a coma after the accident, only to contract MRSA in the hospital then develop pneumonia. Doctors told him he would never walk again. Then, after being sent home he was struck down by testicular cancer and only got the all clear after his right testicle was removed. Incredibly, not only did he fight his way back from paralysis, and overcome his cancer, he has regained a level of fitness that most people who have never felt the sharp end of a surgeon's scalpel would envy. Mr Hawksley participating in the 5K run at the Mullaghmore triathlon: Mr He completed his 350m swim and 5km run in one hour and 25 minutes but dropped out of the cycle leg after his bike didn't arrive in time . Lifesavers: Angela Dunne and her husband Finbar, who were just 10m away when Mr Hawksley had his accident. Their calls for help drew the attention of Ms Hillary who gave him CPR to keep his heart beating . The triumphant return to Mullaghmore brought Mr Hawksley face to face with the lifesavers who helped bring him back from the brink four times within 30 minutes when his heart failed and water filled his lungs. He met Angela Dunne and her husband Finbar, who were only 10 metres away when he took his life-changing dive. Their calls for help drew the attention of Fiona Hillary, 41, who gave Mr Hawksley CPR after rushing to the scene. Mr Hawksley and Ms Hillary had not met until they were introduced as they stood side-by-side on the beach preparing for the gruelling swim. Mr Hawksley in hospital after he broke his neck: He contracted MRSA, then pneumonia while being treated. After his discharge, he was then struck down by cancer and only got the all-clear after his testicle was removed . Mr Hawksley during his rehabilitation: Doctors said he might never walk again, let alone complete a triathlon . Invincible: Mr Hawksley, from Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire, during his recovery after he survived a broken neck, a heart attack, near drowning, paralysis, MRSA, pneumonia and testicular cancer . Ms Hillary, a nurse in Dublin's Beaumont Hospital who was visiting her boyfriend on the day of the accident, told Mr Hawksley: 'Your heart stopped down on the beach and we worked on you. 'We got you back to a faint heart rate, and it stopped again and we got you back again. We were determined we were going to hold on to you. I am delighted you don't remember any of it. 'You did cause a bit of trouble along the way. Your heart was very unstable. You were cold. Your blood-sugar was down. 'I am so glad you don't remember any of it. But you ruined a week of my life I was so upset with what happened to you.' Where it all began: Mr Hawksley stands at the spot where he broke his neck in June 2011 . Mr Hawksley completed his 350m swim and 5km run in one hour and 25 minutes. He was forced to drop out of the bike ride after his mountain bike did not arrive from his home in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, in time. After the event on Saturday, Mr Hawksley also walked down to the spot where he fell. The low tide revealed that instead of falling on rocks, as he originally thought, he had in fact smashed into sand. Mr Hawksley said: 'I feel quite emotional in a really good way. I have shed a tear or two. I am incredibly proud that I got back here to take part in the triathlon within three years. 'For Fiona, who was resuscitating me the last time she saw me, to see me doing as well as I am makes me intensely proud of what I have done.'","Matthew Hawksley did the race in the very town where he broke his neck .

"And so to Match 64, or the World Cup Final as you and I call it. And the two teams are rested, recuperated, and ready for ‘the big one’. No, not the superstars of Germany and Argentina, but the BBC and ITV World Cup line-ups chosen and charged up for the occasion. In times past, any tactic would be used to get an edge, but now there is a reality check. VIDEO Scroll down to see BBC presenter Lineker joke with Maradona about hand of god . High flyer: Gary Lineker made an airbourne entrance on the BBC's World Cup coverage . The BBC know they will win the ratings battle: tradition, personal choice, and avoiding the adverts sees to that, while ITV will pick up a tidy commercial sum. However a very keen professional rivalry still exists. This is TV Sport Business with a capital B. So here goes: . PRESENTERS: . BBC: Gary Lineker starred as an England player in the two tournaments that climaxed in the previous Germany v Argentina World Cup Finals, heavyweight credibility. The BBC host starts airborne with a filmed panoramic flight over Rio but when the programme ‘lands’ in the studio he is seriously suited and fluted. It’s a statement. Landing: Gary Lineker was seen over Rio in casual wear at the start but looked smart in a suit in the studio . Final countdown: Rio Ferdinand, Alan Shearer, Alan Hansen and Lineker in the studio . ITV: Adrian Chiles seems happy to work on a ‘brilliant’ World Cup in Brazil and has backed it up daily by wearing smiles and shorts. But not tonight. It’s still beachside but he opts for full length trousers. 'Copacabana Beach has been our home since day one and we are going to finish where we started,' he says. STUDIO/BEACHSIDE PUNDITS: . BBC: Alan Hansen, Alan Shearer, Rio Ferdinand, like Lineker, are sharp-suited. Ferdinand, an outstanding new addition to football punditry, underlines he has enjoyed being a member of the BBC team and seeing a World Cup from a different perspective. And with the BBC, he’ll realise, in due course, you always win the Final. Beach boys: Martin O'Neill, Ian Wright, Adrian Chiles, Lee Dixon and Glenn Hoddle . Interesting: Glenn Hoddle's hair was battered by the wind but his analysis was spot on for ITV . ITV: Lee Dixon, Ian Wright, Glenn Hoddle and Martin O’Neill, like Chiles, sport long trousers and spill out their theories. Hoddle and O’Neill have been ITV’s outstanding experts and that is still the case tonight. Hoddle is sharp on tactics, while O’Neill is entertainingly forthright including memorably getting Che Guevara into the big game's match analysis. STADIUM PRESENTERS/EXPERTS: . BBC: Clarence Seedorf, a Group stage star for the BBC is in the Maracana Stadium thinks Messi will play a big part in the Final and that while Germany face their toughest match they should win.

ITV: On the other side, Fabio Cannavaro has marveled at the magic of Mascherano, but as a World Cup-winning captain, he gets personal: ‘today brings back memories, very good memories’. THE MATCH: . It’s Guy Mowbray’s second World Cup Final for the BBC, Mark Lawrenson has fought off tough opposition to retain his place, probably on the basis he’ll concentrate more on the quality of the football than the quips. Both Mowbray and Clive Tyldesley, ITV’s man up front, deal with Germany’s late change, Sami Khedira out, Christoph Kramer in. Gonzalo Higuain scores for Argentina but it is offside. Both Mowbray and Tyldesley catch it quickly. ITV’s Glenn Hoddle says at half time that ‘Argentina need to get Leo Messi in the game more’. And it nearly happens two minutes after the break, Messi misses – unbelievably. ‘Of all the players’, . Lawrenson says what we are all thinking. EXTRA TIME: . The tired players reach a mid-extra time break and Hansen puts it straight on the line.

At the final whistle ITV’s Tyldesley sums up the achievement of the new world-beaters: ‘It’s Germany’s time again. The first European winners in South America. The reality is that Germany are champions of the football world.’ But let us leave the last word with the retiring Alan Hansen: . 'It’s a great way to go,’ he says.

"The debate was always going to catch up with Danny Welbeck eventually but his two goals in Switzerland have accelerated the process even before his Arsenal debut. Welbeck’s first appearance for Arsene Wenger’s side is likely to be against Manchester City at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday but his move to London has left a sore festering in the red half of the same northern city. One of their own has gone. Manchester born, Old Trafford bred in the United way, tipped for great things from an early age and sold even though he was not battering down the door to get out. Louis van Gaal and Ed Woodward have allowed him to join a direct top-four rival, without ever knowing how good he was or can be, and without ever giving him an extended run in the central position he prefers. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roy Hodgson say England's players stepped up on Monday . Gone: The debate was going to catch up with Danny Welbeck eventually but his two goals accelerated it . Strike: Welbeck’s first appearance for Arsene Wenger’s side is likely to be against Manchester City . Ready, Danny? Welbeck's move to London has left a sore festering in the red half of Manchester . The new Arsenal striker won the game for England on Monday but he has not always been so prolific in front of goal. COUNTRY VS CLUB RECORD . Welbeck's record with England is much better than his league record for former club Man United. He scores goals more regularly for his country and is far more clinical. Apps: 28 FOR COUNTRY / 92 FOR CLUB . Goals: 10 / 20 . Goals/game: 0.36 / 0.22 . Mins/goal: 171.40 / 253.20 . Shot conversion: 24.39 / 16.26 . The time to judge the winners and losers in this fascinating piece of deadline-day business will be at the end of the season but his England double in Basle, playing up front with Wayne Rooney, provided ammunition for those who suspect United have erred. ‘I would like to have still seen Danny as a United player,’ said former captain Bryan Robson, speaking at the Soccerex conference in Manchester on Tuesday. ‘That is one move I would not have done. He’ll give everything and it’s a great signing.’ It is as if Welbeck represented more than his qualities as a footballer. Mike Phelan, another former United player and Sir Alex Ferguson’s assistant for many years, claimed it was a sign the club was losing its identity; an identity built on the Busby Babes. ‘He can really play,’ said Michael Owen, who trained and played alongside Welbeck for three years. ‘But try getting in the team there. There are so many good players. A lot of the time when Danny did play, he played on the left or the right but, as his England record suggests, when he is played in the middle, he can score goals. It could be one of the signings of the summer.’ Club class: Striker Welbeck completed his move from United to Arsenal on transfer deadline day . Tip: Sportsmail's Jamie Redknapp hailed Arsenal’s new signing as the ‘bargain of the century’ at £16million . It took a big-money transfer at the age of 23 for Daniel Sturridge to trigger his stunning improvement. Similarly, Danny Welbeck is 23 and has just completed a £16million move from Manchester United to Arsenal. Sturridge, now 25, has 36 goals from 52 games since joining Liverpool. So is Welbeck ready for a goals glut of his own? His record would suggest not; with 37 goals in 178 club career games. Welbeck now has 10 England goals, though. At the same age, Gary Lineker had one cap and no goals. And now he will finally get his wish to play as a striker. BY SPORTSMAIL'S CRAIG HOPE . Statistics may drive Roy Hodgson into a four-letter fury, but Welbeck’s are fascinating. His international goal-per-minute ratio puts him up with England’s best and, at 23, he is the same age as Gary Lineker when the prolific striker was still searching for his first international goal. Welbeck is in double figures. Four came against San Marino and Moldova but he has important goals, too, as against Sweden in Euro 2012, and in Switzerland. Jamie Redknapp hailed Arsenal’s new signing as the ‘bargain of the century’ at £16million while former England captain Terry Butcher claimed: ‘Man United will regret selling Welbeck to Arsenal. Arsene Wenger must be purring.’ This suggestion was put to Rooney as he emerged relieved and triumphant from the dressing rooms in Basle’s St Jakob Park. ‘It was his decision,’ shrugged the England captain. ‘He’s at Arsenal now and so I wish him the best of luck. Danny is a fantastic footballer. He’ll score goals if he gets chances.’ You can like our Arsenal Facebook page here . Good news for everyone! Here's Sportsmail's stats! With goals comes confidence and with confidence come more goals. ‘The point is he was playing up front,’ said Hodgson. ‘Not having to think so hard about the things we want him to do when he plays wide. ‘When he plays wide we put a lot of emphasis on him reading the game, tucking in at the right moments, going forward at the right moment. Playing up front frees him to play in what he considers to be his best position.’ Coaches adore Welbeck because he can listen and carry out instructions and is a willing grafter in defensive areas. It was for this reason Ferguson chose him to stop Xabi Alonso when United played Real Madrid. Welbeck had been identified early. They knew something special was coming through the ranks. When Fraizer Campbell scored a glut of goals on loan at Hull City in 2008-09 he was not rushed back because the feeling was that Welbeck would be better. In his second autobiography, published last year, Ferguson put him on a par with anything coming out of Barcelona’s academy at the same time. Perhaps this is why Welbeck’s exit is like a bitter pill at Old Trafford. He was released too willingly, to make room for Radamel Falcao, a Colombian on loan with a spectacular goal record to match his spectacular wages and who is untried in English football. Falcao may sell more shirts and attract more sponsors. He may score more goals. But he also signifies a break from the past for a club which conquered the world by growing its own. The debate will continue to orbit Welbeck. The two teams meet at Arsenal in November. Just the beginning: Welbeck can use his move to Arsenal to kick on and flourish for club and country .

The Jeep can be seen veering on to the hard shoulder before hitting a trailer attached to a broken-down pickup truck at the side of the road . He captured the moment Harris ran off the carriageway, on to the shoulder, then launched off an empty trailer being towed by a 2006 Ford F350, flipping over the top of the vehicle. According to police, Harris was the only one hurt in the accident, and his injuries are not thought to be life threatening. Officers say the Ford had just been red-tagged, meaning it was broken down at the side of the road at the time of the smash. Mr Meyer said: 'Today I was the main witness to this wreck I recorded.

"Mohammad Nazri Abdul Aziz, Minister of Tourism and Culture, said the government will not put 'any more money' into the troubled airline . The Malaysian tourism minister has said the government will not inject any more money into the state-owned Malaysian Airlines after the MH370 disaster. The ailing national carrier has suffered a slump in bookings and £750 million losses following the disappearance of the flight two months ago and is undergoing 'restructuring'. Mohammad Nazri Abdul Aziz, Minister of Tourism and Culture, said the government will not put 'any more money' into the troubled airline. Malaysia Airlines - which is owned by the government through a holding company - had already suffered $1.3billion losses over the past three years as it faced stiff competition and unprofitable routes, Gulf News reports. Mr Aziz said that the government is now unsure what it can do - but he added: 'To inject new capital is certainly not an option.' It now looks unlikely that the government will sell the national carrier to private investor after the share price dropped both under the restructuring plans and the flight MH370 disaster. Aziz - speaking at the Arabian Travel Market to plug the tourism industry in Malaysia - also revealed that there has been a 30 per cent in drop off in tourism numbers from . China in the past two months. Most of those onboard the missing flight were from China. Experts . have narrowed the area where the plane is presumed to have crashed to a . large arc of the Indian Ocean about 1,600 km (1,000 miles) northwest of . the city of Perth in western Australia. The . aircraft could have flown for up to seven hours after it went missing, . meaning that even if the cockpit recorder is found, its standard . two-hour recording loop would not cover conversations during the crucial . early stages of the flight. It comes after an international panel of experts announced they are to re-examine all of the data gathered in the hunt for the missing flight to ensure search crews have been looking . in the right place. Government . officials from Australia, China and Malaysia yesterday pledged not to give . up searching for the aircraft that disappeared almost two months ago. They . met in the Australian capital to discuss the next step in the search . for the missing flight, which will centre around an expanded patch of . seafloor in a remote area of the Indian Ocean off Western Australia. A Malaysian Airlines aircraft takes off from Kuala Lumpur Airport: Questions have been raised after the airline refused to reveal details of 2.3 tonnes of cargo aboard missing jet MH370 that was not listed on its manifest . A map shows the possible path of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 as released by the Malaysian Transport Ministry last week . The area became the focus of the hunt . after a team of analysts calculated the plane's likeliest flight path . based on satellite and radar data. Starting . Wednesday, that data will be re-analyzed and combined with all . information gathered so far in the search, which has not turned up a . single piece of debris despite crews scouring more than 4.6 million . square kilometers (1.8 million square miles) of ocean. 'We've . got to this stage of the process where it's very sensible to go back . and have a look at all of the data that has been gathered, all of the . analysis that has been done and make sure there's no flaws in it, the . assumptions are right, the analysis is right and the deductions and . conclusions are right,' Angus Houston, head of the search operation, . told reporters in Canberra. Investigators . have been stymied by a lack of hard data since the plane vanished on . March 8 during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. A weeklong search . for surface debris was called off last week after officials determined . any wreckage that may have been floating has likely sunk. 'Unfortunately, . all of that effort has found nothing,' Australian Transport Minister . Warren Truss said. 'We've been confident on the basis of the information . provided that the search area was the right one, but in practice, that . confidence has not been converted into us discovering any trace of the . aircraft.' Houston has warned the underwater search is likely to continue for up to a year. European safety officials have today put forward tougher rules for 'black box' flight recorders in the . strongest regulatory reaction yet to the disappearance of Malaysia . Airlines flight MH370. The . European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said it would propose increasing . the recording time on cockpit voice recorders to 20 hours from two to . make it easier to understand plane accidents and prevent vital evidence . being overwritten. Newly . published proposals would also bring into force recommendations made by . French crash investigators after the loss of an Air France jet in the . Atlantic in 2009, but which remain bogged down in talks among . regulators. These include . the addition of a new pinger frequency making it easier to locate the . recording devices under water, where lower frequencies travel further. The proposals appeared in an opinion published by EASA on Tuesday. They have been submitted to the European Union's executive Commission which will use them as the basis for a change in law. 'The . proposed changes are expected to increase safety by facilitating the . recovery of information by safety investigation authorities,' EASA . Executive Director Patrick Ky said in a statement. EASA . also brought forward to 2018 a deadline for extending the battery life . on black box emergency locator beacons to 90 days from 30. All . passenger aircraft have two flight recorders - one for voice and one . for data. Each is equipped with a beacon designed to start emitting . signals as soon as it enters water. The . extended battery life is so far the only recommendation from the three . year-investigation into the Air France disaster to have won full support . at the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a U.N. agency . that coordinates safety standards. ICAO . agreed to back the battery life change from 2018 but EASA originally . gave European operators another year until 2019. (Editing by Laurence .

"Fernando Torres is digging his heels in at Chelsea and the Stamford Bridge club will have to pay £16million for him to leave. The £50m flop has attracted interest from the likes of Roma, but any buying club will struggle to pay Torres' £150,000-a-week wages. The Spanish striker therefore wants Chelsea to pay up the two years remaining on his deal - totalling around £16m - if he is to leave the club.

Atletico Madrid: Segunda Division . Chelsea: FA Cup, Champions League, Europa League . Spain: European Football Championship (2), World Cup . There is frustration from both parties around Torres' future - Chelsea at Torres' refusal to see any potential move through and the striker at his lack of first-team opportunities. The striker, who posted a video of himself undertaking the Ice Bucket Challenge in Ibiza to Instagram on Monday, didn't make the bench for Jose Mourinho's side's 2-0 win over Leicester on Saturday, with new signing Diego Costa and returning Blues icon Didier Drogba both preferred. Despite leaving Torres out of the win, Mourinho insisted he needs three strikers in his squad: ‘I want three strikers in the team. Sometimes I want to play with two and have one on the bench. At other times, someone will be suspended, another will be injured. 'Someone will be needed as a third striker. I can’t do a season without a third striker. Our squad was made carefully the top structure of my club to give me what I want. ‘I believe he will remain. I want him. He will play. He will score goals. He will be very useful for us. He is a fantastic guy, fantastic professional, so no problem. 'I told the players yesterday that at this moment we are playing one match a week and they feel: “Oh, I’m playing, I’m not playing. I’m first option, I’m second, I’m third.” 'But this is over next week. After that we have Capital One cup and Champions League and three matches a week. Everything is much easier for them then because all of them will be playing. ‘The reason he wasn’t on the bench today was that I decided to have a balanced bench with one defender, one full back, one defence midfielder, one attacking midfielder on winger and one striker.

"The way that we define a second could be about to change as scientists claim they have found a more accurate way to measure time. French researchers have demonstrated that a new type of atomic clock is so precise and stable that it could provide a new standard. Jérôme Lodewyck of the Paris Observatory . and his colleagues claim optical lattice clocks lost just one second . every 300 million years and are even more accurately than the current . atomic timepieces that we make do with. French researchers have demonstrated that a new type of atomic clock is so precise and stable that it could provide a new standard.  Under a blue laser light, a cloud of strontium atoms kept in a vacuum fluoresces at a characteristic wavelength (pictured) which could be used to redefine the second . The atomic clock has been used to define a second in the International System of Units since the 1960s. The new clocks remain as perfectly in time that experimental precision can measure, according to his research, which is published in Nature Communications. This test of stability is crucial if optical lattice clocks will be used to redefine the second, he said. According to Nature, Christopher Oates, another expert in atomic clock standards at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Colorado, described the research as: 'very beautiful and careful work, which . gives grounds for confidence in the optical lattice clock and in optical . clocks generally'. The second has been measured to last precisely 9,192,631,770 oscillations of the microwave radiation emitted or absorbed when a caesium atom journeys between two energy states. The atomic clock has been used to define a second in the International System of Units since the 1960s. A cesium frequency standard atomic clock (pictured) is accurate to approximately three parts in 10 quadrillion so it loses one second over 100 million years . An atomic fountain is currently the most accurate way to measure this frequency. A laser forces atoms in gasous caesium skywards and the emission from them probed as they travel through a microwave beam twice. This type of atomic clock is used to set the national time standards, to which we all set our watches uses caesium atomic fountain clocks. They are accurate to approximately three parts in 10 quadrillion so only lose one second over 100 million years. But the new optical lattice clock as well as a couple of other types can do even better. The optical lattice clock of interest to Dr Lodewyck were first demonstrated less than 20 years ago and some experts believe that they will become the most accurate clock ever. The researcher has demonstrated that he is able to get one optical lattice clock to tick at exactly the same time as another to demonstrate its accuracy. The team has also shown that its optical lattice clocks can keep pace with all three caseium fountain clocks housed at the Paris Observatory. While traditional watch mechanisms (pictured) are attractive, stock markets, telecommunications systems and satellite navigation use incredibly accurate atomic clocks . While some may question the use of such incredibly accurate time pieces, they could be used by physicists to explore if some of nature's most constant features change over time. An ion clock is also in development and is currently even more accurate than optical lattice clocks. It loses one second every few billion years but as it relies on a single ion, is not considered dependable enough for commercial use.","Researchers from the Paris Observatory  have demonstrated that a new type of atomic clock is so precise and stable that it could provide a new international standard of time .

"They are not just pretty faces. Cockatoos can learn how to make and use tools, a study found. The clever birds fashioned and used rakes made from pieces of wood to bring tasty morsel of foods within reach. What is more, they didn’t simply copy the technique. Instead, they adapted it, so that their version was better than the original. Scroll down for video . Two years ago, a cockatoo called Figaro (pictured) came up with the idea of biting a piece of wood of his aviary beam and using it to inch a piece of food within reach. This ingenuity made the bird at Oxford University the first known member of the parrot family to make tools, a feat once thought to be uniquely human . Oxford University researcher Alex Kacelnik said: 'The cockatoos seem to emulate and surpass their teacher, which is what all good professors hope for from their best students.' An experiment by the University of Cambridge has proved that members of the crow family, known as corvids, are smarter than most mammals and can perform tasks that three and four-year-old children have difficulty with. Scientists said that, while having very different brain structures, both crows and primates use a combination of mental tools, including imagination and the anticipation of possible future events, to solve similar problems. Other experiments involving the same family of birds found that Caledonian crows can use up to three tools in sequence to obtain food. A study also found that rooks can use stones to raise the level of water in a vessel in order to bring a floating worm into reach. Urban-living carrion crows have been witnessed learning to use road traffic for cracking nuts. Two years ago, Professor Kacelnik told of his amazement that a cockatoo called Figaro came up with the idea of biting a piece of wood of his aviary beam and using it to inch a piece of food within reach. This ingenuity made Figaro the first known member of the parrot family to make tools, a feat once thought to be uniquely human. Now, the professor has shown that other cockatoos can learn to make and use tools, by watching Figaro give ‘carpentry classes’. The three other males tested - Doolittle, Pipin and Kiwi - learnt to use wooden sticks – and had a technique that was superior to their teacher’s. Professor Kacelnik said: ‘There is a substantial difference between repeating a teacher’s behaviour and emulating his or hers achievements while creating one’s own methods. ‘The latter implies a creative process stimulated by a social interaction. While the former could, at least potentially, rely on simple imitation.’ Now, three male cockatoos have learnt to use wooden sticks at Oxford University by mimicking Figaro.  One of the three (Kiwi pictured) made his own stick without prompting, while a second fashioned a stick after watching Figaro perform the same task . One of the three made his own stick without prompting and a second fashioned one after watching Figaro. None of the females tested succeeded and they seemed less motivated than the males, the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B reports. Although many animals can use sticks and tools if they happen to come upon them, few physically fashion them. Other than the cockatoos studied here, examples include New Caledonian crows, which make hook-like sticks to spear insects, and chimps that use their teeth to fan out the ends of the sticks they use to catch termites. All of the birds tested were Goffin’s cockatoos. Native to Indonesia, they are friendly birds sometimes kept as pets.

"Tucked away at Manchester City's Carrington HQ is a little transfer gem. Well, maybe not little; 5ft 11ins and 13st of pure muscle, actually. It's Micah Richards - the man once heralded as the undisputed successor to Gary Neville's England right-back. Where did it all go wrong? Micah Richards (centre) appears to have no future at Manchester City . Next big thing: Micah Richards broke on to the scene with a last-minute equaliser for City at Aston Villa in 2006 . From being one of Europe's hottest teenage properties, Richards' chances of first-team football under Manuel Pellegrini are virtually non-existent. As if his chances of senior football were not remote enough thanks to outstanding form of Pablo Zabaleta, the summer arrival of Bacary Sagna has pushed Richards further down the pecking order. But with six days left to go of the transfer window, the versatile defender is still to escape his City hell. First and foremost, it's important to stress that Richards isn't happy simply taking his money and remaining in the Etihad Stadium shadows. He wants a move; a chance to kick-start his once burgeoning career. Likewise, City manager Manuel Pellegrini has publicly stated his decision to let the 26-year-old leave for pastures new. So where is the problem, you might ask? You might start dissecting the issue when considering Richards' asking price. Despite having less than 12 months on his contract, City value the defender at around £7million. Joy: Richards (centre) appeared to have the world at his feet and it seemed he would be in first team for years . Surplus: Richards does not look like he will get any game time at the Etihad Stadium this season . They have tried to extend his contract, twice, but Richards has turned down both offers - which would have secured him a pay rise - knowing he could fade further into the football wilderness remaining at City. There's not been a shortage of interest in the right-back, either. Arsenal, Liverpool, Everton, Tottenham and West Ham have all given serious consideration to signing Richards. But £7m for a player who will be available for nothing next summer makes little financial sense. Richards' camp hope that issue will be resolved this week. Sportsmail understands the player's representatives will meet with City officials in the next few days in a bid to resolve the issues that have prevented his exit this summer. As well as Premier League interest there is strong interest from Italy and Turkey, and Richards is open to a move abroad to kick-start his stalling career. The next six days will be crucial in determining how Richards stops the downward trend. A move this summer will help reinvigorate a career that once promised so much; another 12 months on the sidelines at City would merely add to his reputation as English football's forgotten man. Arrival: The signing of Bacary Sagna has made Richards third-choice right-back at the Etihad Stadium . Looking ahead: Richards (right) signed a long-term contract in 2008 and was expected to stay be City's future . But the transfer stand-off does little to explain why Richards has fallen off the radar so rapidly over the last two years. Richards played a key role in City's first ever Premier League title triumph in 2012 - making 37 appearances for the club. His performances that season saw him nominated for the club's player of the season award. Roy Hodgson was taking notice, too. Richards just missed out on England's Euro 2012 squad, but was offered a place in the stand-by group. His much-publicised decision to turn down the opportunity was met with huge criticism. Richards had his reasons, though. As he explained at the time: 'I have always said I wanted to play for England. 'Whether I get picked for the next game, it's not down to me. All I can do is keep knocking on the door. 'I will never turn my back on England. A lot of people asked me why I didn't go on standby. It was nothing to do with not wanting to play for England. 'I wanted to play (get on pitch, not just be on standby). Stuart (Pearce) has given me the chance to play (at London 2012).' International: Micah Richards played for England against Holland in 2012 and appeared to be back on track . Prospect: Richards burst on to the international scene and he was expected to turn into a world-class defender . In hindsight, the decision probably wasn't the smartest. Not necessarily because of the stigma that has followed his ever since, but because of the injuries that have followed. He picked up an ankle injury that ruled him out for 10 weeks playing for Team GB at the Olympics; subsequently he went on to make just seven Premier League appearances for City that season. A knee injury sustained against Swansea in October 2012 ruled Richards out for six months, allowing Zabaleta to establish himself as City's premier right-back. The Argentine's outstanding form has played a key role in Richards' lack of game time in recent seasons. But so too has his unwillingness to sign a new contract. Preferred: Dedryck Boyata has signed a new deal at the Etihad and will feature ahead of Micah Richards . Power: Richards was renowned for his strength and speed and looked set to dominate the Premier League . And there is a feeling within the Richards camp that the deal snub has played a key role in Manuel Pellegrini's decision to push the defender to the City peripheries. Zabaleta's performances are generally considered the main reasons for his lack of action, but while Pellegrini rotated in every position last season - the right-back slot remained consistent. Left-back Gael Clichy made 32 appearances for City last season, his rival in that position Aleksander Kolarov made 44. In contrast, Zabaleta made 48 appearances last season, Richards just 10. Pellegrini has pointed to Richards' injury problems last season, but those close to the versatile defender insist he was unavailable for just 10 games last season. The next few days is likely to shape whether Richards can re-affirm his position as one of England's premier defenders. What is for sure, though, is that his next club will be getting a player desperate to make up fir two years in the wilderness. London-bound?

Liverpool . Summer signings Lazar Markovic and Alberto Moreno are in contention to make debuts in Liverpool's Barclays Premier League clash with Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium on Monday. Fit-again winger Markovic and defender Moreno, recruited last week from Sevilla, are both set to be included in the squad for the match but fellow summer arrival Adam Lallana's wait to make his bow definitely goes on, with the midfielder not quite ready yet as his rehabilitation from a knee injury nears its conclusion. Stepping in: Lazar Markovic (left) could make his Liverpool debut on Monday . Jose Enrique's condition will be assessed, while Daniel Agger, Jon Flanagan and Oussama Assaidi remain sidelined. Provisional squad: Mignolet, Johnson, Lovren, Skrtel, Enrique, Gerrard, Henderson, Allen, Coutinho, Sterling, Sturridge, Jones, Manquillo, Toure, Sakho, Lucas, Can, Lambert, Markovic, Moreno. Key match stats (supplied by Opta) Manchester City have scored exactly two goals in each of their last four Premier League games against Liverpool. Liverpool have conceded as many goals in their last four league trips to the Etihad as they had in the previous 11 (10). Daniel Sturridge has scored 32 goals in 44 league games for Liverpool. Sturridge (136 mins) has the fifth best minutes-per-goal rate in Premier League history (minimum 50 goals), ahead of former team-mate Luis Suarez (139). Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero (115 mins) has the best mins-per-goal rate in Premier League history.

"Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of Premier League fixtures, as well as intriguing snippets from the Football League. 1. Brendan Rodgers tore up his belief in passing football to scrape the 1-0 over Stoke that earned Liverpool their first win in six matches. The Reds continually looked long to hit striker Rickie Lambert – they played just 433 passes in the 90 minutes which was 50 less than Mark Hughes side. Until Saturday Liverpool had averaged 545 passes per game in home Premier League games, and last season the Anfield average was 529. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers abandoned his approach to passing football to scrape a 1-0 over Stoke . 2. Frank Lampard’s cameo at Southampton showed why Manuel Pellegrini is so desperate to keep him beyond the end of his current loan from New York Red Bulls which is due to end in January. It wasn’t just the 36-year-old’s goal – his fifth in a total of just 417 minutes of playing time since moving to Manchester City. Lampard also hit perfection with his passing, not once giving the ball away during his 25 minutes on the pitch. Frank Lampard of Manchester City  scores their second goal during Sunday's win over Southampton . City are keen to keep hold of Lampard until the end of the season in their push for the title against Chelsea . 3. Former Arsenal defender Kyle Bartley is emerging as a footballing centre half of genuine promise after taking his time to earn a first team chance at Swansea. The 6ft 4ins ex England Youth international who started his career at Bolton hit 73 accurate passes as Garry Monk’s side built from the back against Crystal Palace – some 18 more than the entire opposition back four put together. Until November Bartley, 23, had started only one Premier League game in the two years since he moved to South Wales but could now make it hard for Argentina World Cup star Federico Fernandez to win his place back when he recovers from a calf injury. Kyle Bartley of Swansea City wins a header and has taken to his first-team chance at the Liberty Stadium . 4. It’s coming up to a year since Steve Clarke was sacked by West Brom because, according to the club’s official statement, he’d won only seven league games out of the previous 34. Albion’s home game with Arsenal was their 34th league match since that controversial decision – and the 1-0 defeat means they have still won only seven of them. Getting rid of the coach who’d landed the club’s highest ever Premier League finish a few months earlier has obviously made a big difference, then. Steve Clarke was sacked by West Brom almost a year ago because he'd won only seven league games in 34 . Albion’s game with Arsenal was their 34th since that - and the 1-0 defeat means they've still won only seven . 5. Tim Sherwood may be long gone from Tottenham Hotspur but his influence remains as Mauricio Pochettino tries to sort out a side to take the club forward. His youth team products Harry Kane and Ryan Mason set the tone for Spurs’ hard-working win over Everton with both covering more than eight miles of running during the 90 minutes. Another academy product Nabil Bentaleb was fourth in Tottenham’s running stats with 7.6 miles as the side collectively outworked Everton, running an aggregate of nearly six miles more (75.5 v 69.7). Mauricio Pochettino (right) saw Tottenham beat Everton courtesy of a Roberto Soldado goal in the 2-1 win . Pochettino's youth products Harry Kane (pictured) and Ryan Mason set the tone for Spurs’ win over Everton . 6. Midfielder Leroy Fer has added a competitive edge to QPR’s midfield and the former Norwich star is forming a combative midfield with Joey Barton and Karl Henry. Dutchman Fer contested 27 individual battles for the ball in the 90 minutes against Leicester and came out on top in 18 of them. That was more duels – and more successes – than any other Premier League midfielder this weekend. Leroy Fer of QPR battled for the ball 27 times against Leicester and came out on top in 18 of them . 7. Gus Poyet is encouraging Connor Wickham to develop his ability to run with the ball as the 21-year-old former England youth star enjoys his first season as a Premier League regular. Wickham attempted six dribbles against Chelsea – more than any other player from his team - from his position on the left of the attack, as well as contributing to the defensive shape of Sunderland’s battle to earn a draw against the leaders. Sunderland manager Gus Poyet is encouraging Connor Wickham to develop his ability to run with the ball . 8. Slavisa Jokanovic was a left-field choice as Watford’s new manager – and he must fear that the club’s erratic owners the Pozzo family are already scouring their Who’s Who of European Football to choose the next one. The former Yugoslavia midfielder has now supervised four defeats in a row following Cardiff’s 1-0 win at Vicarage Road. Before he was appointed as the club’s fourth boss of the season in early October the Hornets had never suffered two successive defeats. Watford manager Slavisa Jokanovic must fear the club's  owners are looking for who's next in the position . 9. Aston Villa have always considered their former youth team captain Daniel Johnson as a goal scoring midfielder and he’s finally living up to the tag after joining Oldham on loan. The Jamaica-born 22-year-old had never scored in senior football during loan spells at Yeovil and Chesterfield, but his two in the 3-0 win at Rochdale take him to three in as many games for Lee Johnson’s side. It could be worth Paul Lambert keeping an eye on him – Joe Cole’s effort at Burnley was the first scored by a midfielder since Ashley Westwood against Hull in early May. Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert will be glad to know Daniel Johnson is coming up good on loan at Oldham . Daniel Johnson had never scored in senior football during loan spells at Yeovil and Chesterfield (pictured) 10. Premier League rules forbid on-loan players from facing their parent club – but it isn’t like that in the Football League which was good news for Southend. Temporary signing John-Joe O’Toole was able to line up against Northampton just two days after leaving Sixfields and played a starring role in the Shrimpers' 2-0 win.

In December, it shall be like that. Former Manchester United fans’ favourite Steve Bruce has failed to beat his old club in 21 attempts as a manager. ‘We also have families. I also have a wife and kids and grandchildren and I cannot see them this Christmas. 'But I want to work in the Premier League, I have to adapt and I shall adapt. But I don’t think it is good for players, neither for the families.’ At least United go into their hectic period in a Champions League spot after a run of one defeat in eight games. Sportsmail's graphic of Robin van Persie's sensational goal against Hull on Saturday . Manchester United face a busy Christmas schedule which could well define their season . Their injury situation has been downgraded from chronic to poor even though Angel di Maria tweaked a hamstring and will have to sit out the Stoke game alongside Luke Shaw, Daley Blind, Rafael and Phil Jones, while Wayne Rooney, James Wilson and Jonny Evans have to be assessed. Rooney hobbled off at full-time after kicks to his calf and knee but has told his manager he is ready to play. On the plus side, Michael Carrick, Marcos Rojo and Falcao all returned from injuries with the return of the £265,000-a-week Colombian presenting Van Gaal with a major selection dilemma. Van Persie responded to recent criticism by setting up United’s second goal for Rooney and then scoring a fine third himself, though Van Gaal insisted the striker’s all-round performance could still improve. Van Gaal is anxious to see what Falcao can do with United as he has to decide by April whether to sign the Monaco loanee on a permanent basis. Radamel Falcao (left) must prove his worth to United before the club commit to a permanent transfer for him . ‘Because I played with two strikers on Saturday I needed Falcao on the bench,’ said Van Gaal. ‘But it was not normal because he was not fit to play 90 minutes but for 20 minutes. Now, I can use him because he has trained for a full week with the first team.’ Defender Chris Smalling, who scored United’s first goal, revealed that Van Gaal has made his intentions clear. ‘He asked for six points as a must from these two home games and we’re going to deliver that on Tuesday,’ said Smalling. ‘Confidence is good with our form at Old Trafford. We’ll be coming out firing again.’ Chris Smalling says confidence is sky high within the Manchester United squad at the moment . VIDEO We dominated, I'm happy - Van Gaal . Hull are on the slide. Manager Steve Bruce has seen his team lose their last four games to slip close to the relegation zone with a tough trip to Everton on Wednesday. Midfielder Tom Huddlestone, dropped for the visit to Old Trafford, remarked on Twitter that Hull had shown United too much respect. It will be interesting to see if he returns at Goodison. ‘I just thought he could sit out (United), freshen him up a bit. Let’s hope it works,’ said Bruce.‘He’s not hit the heights he hit last year but then he set an unbelievable standard. Tom Huddlestone will come again.’","Manchester United secured a third straight Premier League win over Hull .

"An Oklahoma mother was arrested on a charge of child abuse murder after police say her 3-year-old foster son died from a severe head injury. Mallory Krajian, 25, from Broken Arrow, was taken into custody Tuesday. Her husband, Peter Krajian, 44, was also arrested on a child abuse charge in a separate case. The couple's foster son Andrew Prior was rushed to a hospital August 27 suffering from blunt force trauma to the head. Despite the doctors' efforts, the toddler's condition gradually worsened and he passed away from his injures five days later. Scroll own for video . Bad parenting: Mallory Krajian, 5 (left), is facing a child abuse murder charge in the death of her foster son, while her 44-year-old, Peter (right), is accused of abusing their foster daughter . Too young: Andrew Prior, 3, was taken to a hospital last week suffering from head trauma. Five days later, he died from fractures and brain hemorrhage . According to court filings, Mrs Krajian told police the 3-year-old was jumping on the couch when he fell and hit his head on a table. However, investigators found that the foster mother’s account was not consistent with the severity of the boy's injuries. Andrew Prior is survived by a four-year-old sister and 6-year-old brother. The couple have been caring for siblings for more than a year, NewsOn6 reported. Barbara Friend, the children’s biological great aunt, told the station KJRH that the kids were removed from the home of their birth parents, Angela and Matthew Prior, due to neglect. Peter Krajian is facing charges for allegedly abusing his foster daughter. At the time of the incident involving Andrew, the 44-year-old father was allegedly sleeping.

'Tall tale': Andrew's foster mother claimed the child hit his head while jumping on the couch - but the story was inconsistent with the severity of his injuries . Cruelty: Doctors found bald spots on little Andrew's head from alleged hair-pulling and bruises on his body; the toddler's 4-year-old sister was also allegedly abused . When questioned by police, Mallory Krajian allegedly hinted that one of the older children might have been responsible for injuring the toddler. Court documents stated that the boy sustained a skull fracture, neck fracture and brain haemorrhage. Doctors also found bald spots on the toddler's head from suspected hair-pulling and bruises on his body. The Krajians were approached by the Department of Human Services last summer asking them to foster Andrew and his brother and sister after their biological parents were charged with child neglect. Police in Broken Arrow said they have no record of calls about domestic violence or disturbances from the Krajians’ home. Mallory Krajian is being held on $250,000 bail, while her husband is jailed on $25,000 bail. Andrew's surviving brother and sister have been released back into the custody of the DHS.

"Tired: Marc Dubois told his co-pilots he had only had one hour's sleep before their plane crashed . The captain of an Air France plane which crashed into the sea with the loss of all 228 people on board had just one hour’s sleep before setting off, it emerged today. In a damning report which will worry long-haul flyers, it appeared that his co-pilots were also dangerously tired. Five Britons and two Americans were among the dead when AF447 fell out of the sky as it travelled from Rio de Janiero in Brazil to Paris in June 2009. As the Airbus A330 rolled from side to side in a tropical thunderstorm, 32-year-old Pierre-Cedric Bonin and David Robert, 37, were unable to bring it under control. Even when Marc Dubois, the 58-year-old captain, returned from a rest break, his deputies were panicking too much to tell him what the problem was. A detailed analysis of two black box flight recorders has established that airspeed sensors had malfunctioned - probably because they had frozen up. But now a recording of Dubois has emerged in which he says: ‘I didn’t sleep enough last night. One hour – it’s not enough.’ Le Point, the French news magazine which has obtained a previously undisclosed judicial report into the tragedy, says that Dubois was already ‘grumbling’ less than an hour and a half into the flight. Wreckage: Brazilian sailors recover the remains of Air France flight 447 in the Atlantic Ocean in July 2009 . Tragedy: The plane plunged into the sea during a thunderstorm killing all 228 people on board . The pilots had spent the night before in Rio with their wives and girlfriends, but did not appear alert enough to deal with a high-altitude stall. They ignored normal procedures and raised, rather than lowered, the plane's nose when it lost lift - or 'stalled'. An aerodynamic stall is has nothing to do with the engines, which investigators said had operated and responded throughout. The result was a three-and-a-half minute plunge before hitting the ocean. All those on board - who came from 32 nations, including five from Britain, three from Ireland, and two from America - died after the plane hit the sea at a speed of 180ft a second. Recording: The black box from the plane, which has revealed some of the chilling details of the crash . The French aviation safety authority has already released a report which agrees with a 365-page judicial inquiry that the 'captain had failed in his duties' and 'prevented the co-pilot from reacting appropriately'. French judges have launched a criminal inquiry into Air France and Airbus for alleged manslaughter. Co-pilots Bonin and Robert had racked 2,900 and 6,500 flying hours respectively, compared to Dubois's 11,000. Despite this, Dubois took more than a minute to respond to calls for help. Those on board included Bonin's 38-year-old wife, Isabelle, who was travelling without their two boys, aged eight and four. A judge has already ordered Air France to pay around £120,000 in compensation to the families of each victim, but this provisional figure is likely to rise substantially. Air France has reviewed and improved its training procedures since the crash.","Marc Dubois recorded saying: 'I didn't sleep enough last night'

This shows a copy of the duck in Tianjin, China . As reported by International Business Times, 'Big yellow duck'  has also been censored as a search item. It comes after a user on Sina Weibo, a Chinese social network, posted a doctored version of the famous  Jeff Widener's  photograph of a protester confronting a line of tanks in the square. The doctored photograph instead features four ducks in row instead of the tanks. it was a reference to the 54-foot yellow duck created by Florentijn Hofman, . which floats in Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour.

Freedom: The commemorations have only been allowed to take place in Hong Kong amidst heightened security in mainland China . Vibrant: Protesters brought a series of eye-catching banners aimed at undermining the government's anti-democratic policies . The Chinese Government considers the peaceful protest . by students and workers to have been a 'counter-revolutionary' revolt, . and has previously defended the decision to send in tanks and troops. It has never provided an official death toll. The move by Beijing is . part of a major push to suppress discussion of the massacre across China and Hong Kong, particularly online and around . certain parts of the capital. Security personnel were patrolling . the narrow streets close to Beijing's Forbidden City and outside the former . house of Zhao Ziyang, the Communist party secretary who was purged and . held under house arrest following the protests.

"Vladimir Putin last night pointed to Russia’s nuclear arsenal and warned the West: ‘It’s best not to mess with us’ on Ukraine. In a menacing intervention, the Russian president denied Nato, British and American reports that Russian forces are operating in eastern Ukraine. And he warned the West against any attempt to support Ukraine in its efforts to defeat Russian separatists. Speaking at a pro-Kremlin youth camp near Moscow, he said: ‘Russia’s partners... should understand it’s best not to mess with us. Ukrainian servicemen use a brief lull in the conflict to make running repairs on their heavy armour . Mechanics have field-striped part of the engine and drive components to keep the vehicle running . Ukraine has appealed to the West for supplies of modern weaponry to help repel any Russian advance . ‘Thank God, I think no one is thinking of unleashing a large-scale conflict with Russia. I want to remind you that Russia is one of the leading nuclear powers.’ Mr Putin also launched an astonishing verbal assault on the Ukrainian government, comparing it to the Nazis and saying its actions in the east of the country ‘sadly reminds me of the events of the Second World War, when German fascist... occupiers surrounded our cities’. Russia is one of five countries which has nuclear weapons as a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Mr Putin has the second largest stockpile of warheads in the world – 4,300 according to the latest estimates from the Federation of American Scientists. Of those, approximately 1,600 are long-range land and sea-based ballistic missiles. Nato believes that there are at least 1,000 Russian troops now actively engaged in the conflict . Ukrainian army fires during fighting between militants and Ukrainian forces in Donetsk region. Nato  said that it believes that well more than 1,000 regular Russian troops are fighting in Ukraine . The US has an estimated 4,765, Britain has 225, France 300 and China 250. Of other counties thought to have nuclear weapons – India, Pakistan and Israel are thought to have fewer than 100 and North Korea fewer than ten. British intelligence believes Russia has made a significant incursion into Ukraine, involving at least 1,000 regular troops fighting alongside pro-Russian militias on the ground. British sources said Russia had supplied 100 battle tanks, 80 armoured personnel carriers, 500 anti-tank weapons and 100 artillery pieces to separatists.

German foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said: ‘All our hopes of de-escalation have been disappointed and the situation is showing signs that it is now out of control.’ Polish foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski said: ‘If it looks like a war, sounds like a war and kills like a war, it is a war.’ Sweden’s foreign minister Carl Bildt warned: ‘This is the second invasion of Ukraine in a year. We have to call a spade a spade and stop playing around.’ Meanwhile, heavily armed pro-Russia separatists held firm control of the strategic coastal town of Novoazovsk yesterday. At least half a dozen tanks were seen in the town of about 12,000 people, bearing the flags of Novorossiya, the ‘state’ proclaimed by rebels in two eastern Ukraine regions.

It is now a term used by Russia ultra-nationalists who want to re-conquer the area. The region was seized by imperial Russia at the end of the 18th century from the Ottoman Empire and remained under its control until the October Revolution and the collapse of the empire in November 1917. The term implies a giant semi-circle of Ukraine encompassing Kharkiv, Lugansk, Donetsk, Mykolaiv, Kherson, and Odessa.

"A paedophile shakes hands with Jimmy Savile as two young children look on from the sofa next to him. This image shows Keith Harding – a leading figure in the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) – appearing on Jim’ll Fix It in 1980. And it has emerged that the antiques expert’s appearance on the show was ‘set up’ by Savile’s aides. Revealed: Paedophile Information Exchange member Keith Harding, right, was invited onto this 1980 Christmas special of Jim'll Fix It in a 'set-up' by production staff . Shamed: Harding was unmasked as an active member of the Paedophile Information Exchange and believed to be membership secretary of the group who wanted the age of consent lowered to four . Producers arranged for a family to write a letter to Savile as a pretext for inviting Harding – who was membership secretary of the notorious paedophile campaign group – on to the BBC show. It is thought the appearance may have been part of a campaign by PIE, which campaigned for the age of consent to be reduced to four, to build links with influential public figures. And it was allowed to happen despite Harding, who restored items for royalty, being convicted of child sex offences in the 1950s. Savile has since been unmasked as one of Britain’s most prolific sex abusers and is thought to have assaulted hundreds of people between the ages of five and 75. Lawyers for Savile’s victims said the revelations were ‘extremely troubling’ and ‘suspicious’ and called for an investigation into Harding’s links to business and political figures. Revealed: Harding was allowed access to children via his Cotswolds museum despite social services knowing about his convictions . Harding was convicted of indecent assault against four children aged eight and nine in the late 1950s and was a ‘schedule 1’ offender – meaning his convictions remained on file for life. But he was later given the Freedom of the City of London. The former chairman of the British Horological Institute also ran a museum regularly visited by children, despite social services being aware 20 years ago of his convictions for child abuse. He died aged 82 in June this year. Confidential social services documents seen by the BBC described his convictions as a ‘real cause for concern’ and warned that children should not be left unsupervised with him. But in December 1980, Harding appeared on Jim’ll Fix it after repairing a music box belonging to a 13-year-old girl at his London workshop. She was then invited on to the show and filmed with her younger brother in the studio alongside Harding and Savile. The girl’s brother Dean, now in his 40s, told BBC News the feature was ‘set up’ by the production team. He said: ‘The way it came about was that my uncle was asked by his then girlfriend, who was a researcher at the BBC, if anybody in the family had a music box. 'Obviously the letter must have been done after the facts.’ Dean said that he and his sister were chaperoned throughout the programme and nothing inappropriate happened. Richard Scorer, from law firm Slater & Gordon, which is representing nearly 200 alleged victims of Savile, said: ‘We know PIE had a very deliberate strategy of trying to build links with influential people. 'The government inquiry needs to look into these links.’","Keith Harding convicted of abusing four children, aged 8 and 9, in 1950s .

"A terrorist recruitment picture posted on Twitter showing seven British jihadis posing with AK47s has been ridiculed by other social media users who have called the group cowards for hiding their faces. The men were captured in full combat gear, proudly clutching their rifles with balaclavas and rags covering their faces and hiding their identities. An eighth UK-born terrorist, calling himself Khattab A Mujaji, posted the photo, which he had extracted from a nine minute propaganda video, and told followers: 'A few of the British brothers.' Scroll down fro video . Mocked: The photo showing seven British jihadis clutching AK47s was ridiculed by Twitter users who suggested that the men were cowards for hiding their faces . He claims to be part of Rayat Al-Tawheed, a group of militants who have travelled from the UK to fight for ISIS. The picture was supposed to inspire more Brits to join ISIS but was instead targeted by other Twitter users, who dismissed the gun-wielding terrorists as cowards. One said: 'Such brave men and so proud that they dare not show their faces'. Another wrote: 'Pussies with masks'. Another Brit terrorist posted snaps of a sun-drenched lake captioned: 'Jihad is the tourism of the believers.' But his comment sparked outrage, with one tweeting: 'Oh yeah, raping women, beheading prisoners, mass murdering is a great way to travel for evil.' It has emerged that the British jihadis, responsible for holding prisoners including murdered US journalist James Foley and currently detained British journalist, John Cantlie, are known for their brutality. In a recent video posted online, John Cantlie, a photojournalist and war correspondent who has worked for several national newspapers, said that he had been 'abandoned' by Britain. Propaganda: The picture was posted by an ISIS militant from the UK who calls himself Khattab A Mujaji . Speaking to the Daily Mail following the video's release, a source spoke of how James Foley and John Cantlie were tortured by British jihadis. They said: 'The water-boarding was not every day – maybe two or three times. The British jihadis did the most appalling stuff in the world – they were psychopathic.’ British militants forced hostages to take part in boxing matches against each other and the losers of these bouts were tortured. Reaction: Tweets show such of the comments posted by people in response to the British jihadi photo . The fights, which the hostages dubbed the ‘Royal Rumble’, were held almost entirely for the entertainment of their British captors, one of whom once claimed to have been a boxer in the UK before leaving to join the Islamic jihad. During these forced gladiator-style bouts, the jihadis known as the ‘British Beatles’ watched from a skylight above in order to get a better view of the fighting below. Security experts say ISIS is coming under increased pressure from Muslims horrified by its ultra-violent regime. Many have begged them to free aid volunteer Alan Henning, 47, from Eccles, Gtr Manchester, after executioner Jihadi John threatened he would be the next hostage victim. One source told the Daily Star: 'The fact these people are now being openly mocked on social networking sites proves they are losing the battle.'","Men pictured in combat gear, clutching guns with faces completely hidden .

"A US professional mountaineer killed by an avalanche while  snowboarding described weather and snow conditions as 'absolutely unbelievable' hours before she died. Liz Daley, 29, from Tacoma, Washington took a photograph of the  7,000-foot Cerro Vaspignani peak in Patagonia, Argentina on Monday before posting it to her Instagram account. Around 2pm local time Daley was snowboarding on the steep mountain when thousands of tonnes of ice and snow slid away, carrying the professional extreme sports star to her death. Extreme sports professional Liz Daley, pictured died following the avalanche in southern Argentina . On the morning of her death, Daley took this photograph of the mountain that would eventually kill her . Daley, 29, recently joined the Eddie Bauer sports team to promote the company's clothing and equipment . The avalanche carried Daley over the edge of a large cliff and she was killed by the trauma. Help arrived at her within minutes, but her injuries were too severe to save her. In her last ever Instagram post Daley was pleased with the conditions: 'Whelp! That was sick. The weather and snow conditions are absolutely unbelievable here in Patagonia. AH! Somebody pinch me! S***, might need a roundhouse kick. #Alaskagonia #powdergonia.' According to one of her sponsors Eddie Bauer: 'Liz was an accomplished splitboarder, alpine climber and mountain guide who was born and raised in Washington. She was a beloved member of our snow sports team and will be sorely missed by all those who knew her.' It is understood the accident happened in Southern Argentinian Patagonia near the border with Chile. Her two-member film crew and three of her sports team escaped injury during Monday's accident. Daley's death is the third to have hit the extreme sports community in South America over the past week. Daley was killed on Monday in Patagonia near the Argentinian / Chilean border in the Monte Fitz Roy area . Daley, pictured, was the third professional winter sports professional killed in South America last month . The avalanche carried Daley over the side of a large cliff and she died as a result of the trauma . Chilean searchers on Tuesday found the bodies of professional skiers Carl Andreas Fransson of Sweden and Jean Phillipe Auclair of Canada. They had been missing since an avalanche swept them away while they were hiking in Chile's south. Daley worked as a professional mountaineer, guide and participated in a range of extreme sports. According to Snowbrains.com Daley was on the Cerro Vaspignani peak along with pro snowboarder Chris Coulter, pro skier Drew Tabke, guide Kent McBride, photographer Chris Figenshau and film maker Nick Kalisz. It is understood that the avalanche happened at 2pm local time on September 29. Her body was later recovered by the Argentine military. The American Alpine Institute paid tribute to Daley on its blog: 'Liz guided mountaineering, ice climbing, and backcountry splitboarding in the North Cascades of Washington; rock climbing in Red Rock, Nevada; and expeditions on Mt. McKinley, Alaska. She was a sponsored athlete for Patagonia, Jones Snowboards, and most recently for Eddie Bauer for whom she was on assignment in Patagonia. She pursued extreme splitboarding in the North Cascades, in Alaska, and in Chamonix, France, where she spend part of every winter. 'Liz was regarded as America’s top extreme splitboarder for her spectacular descents in the Cascades, Alaska, and the European Alps. She was highly skilled as a guide, and her background included Avalanche Training AIARE Level 1 & 2 and certification as an Emergency Medical Technician. 'Her death in an avalanche is felt as especially tragic because she was so willing to give up a potential “killer descent” when there were indicators of instability in the snowpack. She sought extreme challenges but she never sought risk.'","Liz Daley was exploring with colleagues in Patagonia when she died .

"One in four criminals went straight back to crime, according to new figures which the government admitted are ‘shameful’. And almost 1,000 offenders have been recalled to prison but are still on the loose. The figures are particularly embarrassing for ministers coming just days after David Cameron’s crime and justice speech in which he promised a ‘rehabilitation revolution’. Prime Minister David Cameron (right) was escorted around C wing by prison officer Margaret Vaughan, during a visit to Wormwood Scrubs Prison this wek . Almost 50,000 offences were committed by . offenders who had spent time in jail last year. Labour claimed the government’s justice policy is ‘in tatters’. In 2010, a total of 497,969 offences were committed by 173,274 offenders. More than half (55.3 per cent) of the offences were committed by 78,149 offenders with 11 or more previous offences. More than 50,123 of these involved 10,000 offenders who had previously been jailed more than 10 times. For criminals leaving jail, the reoffending rate was 47.5 per cent, up from 46.8 per cent in 2009. Among adults jailed for less than 12 months, 57.6% went on to commit another crime. Meanwhile, separate figures showed . more than 150 violent criminals and sex offenders are at large in the . community despite breaching the terms of their release or committing . another offence. A total of 988 criminals had been recalled to prison but not put back behind bars by the end of June. These include 17 killers - 16 of them murderers - 11 rapists and at least four paedophiles. Some 379 have been on the run for more than five years, the figures showed. Almost 1,000 criminals have been recalled to jail, but are still not behind bars . A MoJ spokesman said: ‘We are tackling . the shamefully high reoffending rates in this country by introducing a . rehabilitation revolution - offenders must be punished, but we must also . deal with the root causes of offenders' behaviour so they don't return . to crime.’ The Prime Minister used a major speech to declare he wanted to break the cycle of reoffending by the end of 2015. All but a small number of high-risk prisoners would receive help to turn their lives around. But Labour’s shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said: ‘This Government’s justice policy is in tatters. David Cameron's latest re-launch 29 months after first becoming Prime Minister won’t change these appalling figures. ‘He should be aggressively addressing the scandalous rates of reoffending rather than stunts. Cutting police and probation, reducing Judges’ powers and reducing help to victims shows how out of touch he is.’","Ministry of Justice says it is determined to tackle 'shamefully high reoffending rates'

"Twitter users write the N-word a staggering 500,000 times a day, it has been revealed. The slur - arguably the most racially charged word in US history - has been posted on the social networking site more than 13 million times in the past month, according to data on Topsy.com. In contrast, 'bro' and 'dude' - two terms with which n***a is synonymous to many people under the age of 35 - are used only 300,000 and 200,000 times, respectively, on a daily basis. Over the past 30 days, the former phrase has been posted on Twitter around eight million times, while the latter has been written by users just five-and-a-half million times. Shocking: Twitter users write the N-word - arguably the most racially charged word in U.S. history - 500,000 times a day, it has been revealed. Above, a graph showing the word's usage on Twitter over 30 days . High usage: The slur has been posted on the social networking site more than 13 million times in the past month, according to data on Topsy.com. Above, the latter half of the graph on the analytics website . The shocking figures reveal the ingrained and seemingly increasingly prevalent nature of the N-word in today's American youth culture, with many teenagers apparently using the phrase unthinkingly. Although the slur has long been used in America, it now regularly makes an appearance in college debates, video games, online forums, Christian rap and other elements of popular culture. 'It’s such a regular part of my vernacular. It’s a word I use every day,' actor Tehran Von Ghasri, a D.C. who is both African American and Iranian American, told The Washington Post. The 34-year-old added: 'I’m still uncomfortable with [a] white guy saying, ""You’re a cool n***a"". But in 25 years, I would hope that my kid’s not uncomfortable — because that white guy wouldn’t mean it in a demeaning, degrading way. He would mean it as a positive thing.' It comes as the National Football League is trying to implement a 'zero tolerance' policy toward players' use of the N-word on the field following a number of high-profile incidents. Under the regulations,  referees are allowed to issue a 15-yard penalty to players who use the racial slur for a first time and an ejection to those who employ it again. Racial epithets have become commonplace on Twitter - more common than many less offensive terms . Fewer uses: In contrast to n***a, 'bro' - a term with which n***a is synonymous to many people under the age of 35 - is used only 300,000 times on Twitter per day. Above, the first half of Topsy.com's 'bro' montly data . Figures: 'Dude' - also perceived by many to be a synonymous term for n***a - is tweeted 200,000 times a day . Despite officials' good intentions, not everyone has reacted positively to the policy - with many players and pundits deeming it too heavy-handed, unfair and out of touch. Others believe players - the majority of whom are black - will refuse to accept the language directives of predominantly white NFL executives. In July 2013, Philadelphia Eages wide receiver's Riley Cooper, who is white, was caught on video shouting the N-word word at a country music concert. Four months later, Miami Dolphins lineman Richie Incognito, who is also white, called his mixed-race teammate, Johnathan Martin, a 'half-n***er' via voicemail. He was later suspended for three months.

Four months later, Miami Dolphins lineman Richie Incognito (left) called his black teammate, Johnathan Martin, a 'half-n***er' via voicemail . And already this season, San Francisco 49ers’ Colin Kaepernick, a mixed-race quarterback - alongside several other players - has been penalized and fined by the NFL for using the slur. Originating from the Latin word for black, 'niger', the N-word infiltrated American popular culture in the 1980s and 90s, where it remains a controversial term. Many people, including ex-NFL player Donté Stallworth, claim that because today's generation was not directly involved in the civil rights struggle, they do not use the term in a racist manner. 'I’m empathetic to the older generation because they lived it, [but] why are we still attaching ourselves to that word?' said former wide receiver Stallworth. 'Let evolution happen. Let pop culture take that word away to the ocean, and let anyone use it... That word's not meant for us anymore. ""N***a"" is a part of pop culture. It’s just a word.' Others believe that the N-word in its '-a' capacity is endearing - as opposed to its alternative '-er' ending, which is supposedly linked to the term's historic, racist origins. But Dineytra Lee, a Los Angeles dancer of African American and Puerto Rican heritage, argued: 'You change a vowel or two. It doesn’t change the meaning.' Just days ago, the U.S. Army publicly apologized for saying  'Negro' was an acceptable term to use to describe black personnel. Apology: Just days ago, the U.S. Army publicly apologized for saying 'Negro' was an acceptable term to use to describe black personnel (file picture). They have limited acceptable terms to 'Black or African American' In October, section 6-2 of the Army's AR 600-20 regulations stated that the phrase could appropriately be used to refer to 'a person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa'. However, last Saturday, officials apologized for the policy, saying they had limited the acceptable terms to 'Black' or 'African American'. Reports said 'Haitian' had also been deemed okay.

"British jihadis fighting in Syria want to come home after becoming disillusioned with the conflict, it emerged today. In the last three years, more than 500 radicalised Britons are believed to have headed out to the war-torn country, where Islamist groups are fighting President Bashar Assad's forces. But some of those who signed up to fight have now contacted authorities in Britain saying they have had enough of the war-zone and want to return home, it was reported today. Scroll down for video . An armed ISIS member parades through the streets of Raqqa, Syria, waving a jihadist flag. It is said that some Britons fighting alongside Jihadis in the country now want to return home . A man representing a group of 30 militants reportedly contacted King's College London's International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence (ICSR), telling them his group want to come back. The men, who went to the region in the hope of toppling President Assad, are reportedly unhappy at having to fight against other rebel factions. According to The Times, the man told researchers: 'We came to fight the regime and instead we are involved in gang warfare. It's not what we came for but if we go back [to Britain] we will go to jail.' The ICSR's Professor Peter Neumann told newspaper: 'The people we have been talking to... want to quit but feel trapped because all the Government is talking about is locking them up for 30 years.' He believes as many as a fifth of British fighters in the country could be trying to find a way out of their current situation. He claimed less-hardened jihadists  could be used to show would-be recruits that the reality of battle may not match the image presented by ISIS propaganda. At least 40 of the estimated 250 Britons to have already returned from the region have been arrested and are now facing trial on terrorism charges. An ISIS militant in Syria prepares to set fire to what appears to be a British passport in a recent extremist video . Labour leader Ed Miliband has suggested a mandatory programme of de-radicalisation for people involved on the fringes of radical groups like ISIS. But the government has been reluctant to support any scheme which could allow wrongdoers to escape punishment for their crimes. News of waning morale among British jihadis came after terrorism experts said social media posts show many Westerners who took up arms are 'immature'. After studying what fighters had posted online, Professor Greg Barton, from the Global Terrorism Research Centre at Monash University, told Daily Mail Australia: 'We're dealing with young men doing foolish things, driven by peer pressure and a desire for affirmation. 'I think it's generally true from (their) social media posts that what we see reflects a fairly juvenile mentality.' Mohammed el-Araj (left) and Abu Hujama al-Britani (right), both from London, died fighting with extremists . Yesterday, a fighter who defected from ISIS said the British militant seen in recent execution videos - who is known as 'Jihadi John' - was chosen to carry out the task to make other Westerners feel 'part of cause'. The man told CNN: 'It is possible that the goal was to project the image that a European or a Western person executed an American so that they can showcase their Western members and appeal to others outside Syria.' Led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, ISIS - which comes from the Arabic word 'al-Sham', meaning Levant, Syria or Damascus - has overrun large areas of Syria and Iraq. In June, it seized control of Mosul, Fallujah and Tikrit in northern Iraq in a series of deadly military offensives. Although its exact size is unclear, the extremist group is believed to include thousands of fighters and is highly fanatical, often killing Shia Muslims and Christians. This week, the Islamic State released a video featuring British aid worker David Haines (right), who has been threatened with execution. David Cameron (left) is coming under rising pressure to unleash a military response . This week, the group released a video of U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff being beheaded, calling the execution retaliation for U.S. air strikes. The footage also featured British aid worker David Haines, 44, who was captured by militants near Atmeh refugee camp in Syria and has been threatened with beheading. David Cameron, who is coming under growing pressure to unleash a military response, said Britain would use 'everything we have in our armoury' to squeeze ISIS out of existence. But yesterday, he told fellow Nato leaders not to pay ransoms for hostages as it only increases kidnappings and funds further terrorism. The Prime Minister is now preparing to personally brief a member of the Haines family on the latest developments in the case.","More than 500 Britons have gone to Syria to fight alongside Islamists .

"A Brazilian man, his wife and his mistress have all been handed long sentences for killing two women and using their flesh to make meat pastries which they atea and sold.

The defendants' lawyers told reporters they would appeal the sentences. Scroll down for video . Monsters: Jorge Beltrao Negromonte da Silveira, his wife Isabel Cristina Pires lured women to their house by promising them a job as a nanny. Then they killed them and ate their flesh in meat-filled pastries . Guilty: Bruna Cristina Oliveira da Silva, who lived with the couple, was Silveira's mistress . An official at the court in the city of Olinda, on Brazil's northeastern Atlantic coast, said the seven-person jury handed down the sentences on Friday night. The three were arrested in the city of Garanhuns in April 2012, and police said they confessed to the crimes. At the time, they reportedly told police they belonged to a sect that preached 'the purification of the world and the reduction of its population'. They were convicted of murder, desecration and concealment of a body. Gruesome: Police found the remains of two women in the back yard of the suspects' house (pictured) Officers said the trio lured women to their house by promising them a job as a nanny. It was said they then used the victims' flesh to make thick empada pastries, which were eaten by them and a child who lived with them. The pastries were also sold to some neighbours, schools and hospitals who were told they contained tuna or chicken, authorities said. Remains of the two women were found in the home's backyard. Shortly after the three suspects' arrest, police found a 50-page book written by Silveira entitled Revelations of a schizophrenic, in which he said he heard voices and was obsessed with killing women. Chilling: In chilling echoes of the film Sweeney Todd, authorities said the trio made thick empada pastries (stock image) with the flesh of their victims, which the three and a young child who lived with them ate .

Shortly after their arrest, police found a 50-page book titled Revelations Of A Schizophrenic, written by Silveira. In it, he said he heard voices and was obsessed with killing women . The G1 news site quoted Silveira as saying during the trial's opening: 'I committed a horrible, monstrous mistake. It was a moment of extreme weakness and brutality that I regret.' Their victims, believed to have been killed between 2008 and 2012, include Alexandra Falcao, 20, police said. Silviera also described the death of Jessica Camila da Silva Pereira, a 17-year-old murdered in 2008. Police were alerted to the murders when the trio attempted to use a credit card belonging to one of their victims.","Jorge Beltrao Negromonte da Silveira, Isabel Cristina Pires and Bruna Cristina Oliveira da Silva are all jailed for murder and desecration .

"An investigative journalism site has ripped apart reports the Malaysian Boeing MH17 was shot down by a Ukranian war plane, claiming to have exposed the images as possibly photoshop fakes. A report by Russian state television claimed to have discovered a 'sensational' satellite photo of the last seconds of the doomed flight over Ukraine. The release of 'leaked' satellite images show a missile hurtling towards the passenger plane, while it was also claimed that the space pictures were from a British or US satellite. But following the release of these images, Bellingcat said suspicions were immediately raised by a number of online aviation experts, debating the inconsistencies, which lead to claims they were indeed 'fakes'. Scroll down for video . Russian Channel 1 has released satellite images which suggest Malaysian Boeing MH17 (top of picture) was shot down by a Ukrainian warplane (bottom left) Aviation experts claims the images are actually fakes pointing out there is several issues including the type of aircraft (pictured) which conclude it is not a Boeing 777 . Suspicions arose on Twitter that the images were not real including comparisons to the fighter jet (pictured) which was claimed to have shot down MH17 . Bellingcat says it is clear that the satellite map imagery was created from a composite of different satellite map imagery . The news couldn't come at a worse time for Russian President Vladimir Putin who has already faced a rather cold reception by other world leaders at the G20 summit in Brisbane after Western leaders piled pressure on Mr Putin for the crisis in Ukraine and threatened more sanctions. The flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was travelling over the conflict-hit region when it disappeared from radar. A total of 283 passengers, including 80 children, and 15 crew members were killed. Russian TV presenter Mikhail Leontiev claimed that the mysterious source who provided the images concluded they showed 'how a Mig-29 fighter plane destroys the Boeing passenger plane'. Suspicions arose immediately on Twitter, and inconsistencies were pointed out . This aviation expert pointed out the timeline of the images being posted online . Bellingcat said suspicions were immediately raised by a number of online aviation experts, debating the inconsistencies, which lead to claims the images, showing MH17 being shot down by a fighter jet, fake . But the citizen journalists site made claims that the images which were posted on a Russian message board on October 15th, claimed to originate from WikiLeaks, but that this contradicted their origin. Bellingcat said it was clear that the satellite map imagery was created from a composite of different satellite map imagery and that the fighter jet shown is reminiscent of an Su-27, not Su-25 as reported by Russian TV. There has also been questions over the plane's Malaysian airlines logo, with aviation experts concluding it's in the wrong place while the 'MH17' plane appears to be a Boeing 767 rather than a 777. The Bellingcat site said after all the evidence was presented, it was clear the images weren't credible, concluding Malaysian flight MH17 was not shot down by another aircraft. The West has repeatedly suggested the plane was shot down by pro-Moscow rebels using a Russian-made BUK missile system. Bellingcat says it is clear that the satellite map imagery is created from a composite of different satellite map imagery . The claims that the images were a fake obviously angered some who believed they were real . It was claimed that the mysterious source who provided the images concluded they showed 'how a Mig-29 fighter plane (pictured) destroys the Boeing passenger plane' A total of 283 passengers, including 80 children, and 15 crew members were killed after MH17 was shot down . Russia has argued an unidentified plane was in vicinity at the time of the crash, and that Ukraine and the West have hushed up this fact. The Kremlin-owned channel's presenter said: 'Today we have all grounds to suppose that a State crime was committed by those who deliberately destroyed the plane. And by those who are cynically hiding it, having the full information.' The extraordinary broadcast came ahead of Western leaders including David Cameron confronting Vladimir Putin over the crash at a summit in Australia. Channel One claimed: 'We have at our disposal a sensational shot, supposedly made by foreign satellite spy during the final seconds of MH17 above Ukraine.' Ivan Adrievskiy, vice president of Russian Engineers Union, suggested the image was taken by an American or British satellite . An 'expert' called George Bilt was cited as saying the Boeing was shot out of the sky in 'a classic fighter jet attack from the rear' The reported disputed a BUK missile as the cause of the tragedy. 'To cut it short, it looks like there was no BUK and no launch from the ground. There were dozens professional and thousands of amateur witnesses, and no-one registered it,' claimed Leontiev. Ivan Adrievskiy, vice president of Russian Engineers Union, said: 'We see a photograph taken from space from a low orbit. Usually such images are taken for the sake of general reconnaissance of the air and the ground. 'The coordinates of the photograph mean we can suppose that the image was taken by an American or British satellite. 'We have studied this picture in detail and did not find any sign proving it to be fake.'

"Russian spies 'tricked' US whistleblower Edward Snowden into asking Moscow for asylum by posing as diplomats after spending six years targeting him, a former major in the KGB has claimed. Boris Karpichkov, who fled Russia after 15 years serving with the KGB said Snowden had been identified as a potential defector as far back as 2007. Snowden, 30, arrived in Moscow after he was revealed as responsible for leaking more than 1.7 million highly classified US documents. Former KGB spy Boris Karpichkov, left, said Russian security services first identified Edward Snowden, right, as a possible defector back in 2007 while he working with the CIA in Geneva as a communications specialist . Karpichkov told the Sunday People that Russian security agents leaked information concerning Snowden's arrival in Moscow to provoke the US into action. The US cancelled Snowden's passport before he could get a connecting flight out of Moscow, forcing him to seek asylum. According to Karpichkov: 'It was a trick and he fell for it. Now the Russians are extracting all the intelligence he possesses.' Karpichkov said: 'He lives in a block of flats in Moscow’s ­suburbs controlled by the FSB. His flat is heavily alarmed to stop anything happening to him. He meets the FSB twice a week over plenty of food and drink.' Former CIA official Robert Baer has said the US has began investigating whether Snowden had been turned by the Russians in 2007. Bauer believes the Russians will want to know the extent of the West's electronic interception capability. Edward Snowden, right, told Brian Williams, left, that he had been trained as a spy by the CIA had had lived undercover using as assumed name and working in a cover job . Mr Baer said his former colleagues at the CIA were conducting a 'damage assessment' to determine what top secret information Snowden handed over to the Russians. According to Baer, the Russians first became aware of Snowden while he was working for the CIA in Geneva. He said: 'They are looking at the possibility that information was passed on. It’s a damage assessment – clearly what he saw in Geneva has to be looked at and it has to be assumed that he passed it on to Russia.’ He said: 'You’d be seeing the intelligence briefings that Geneva would get. You’d also be getting NSA reports. That’s the sort of regular stuff he’d be getting across his desk. 'He was a disaster there. As a communicator he will have seen everything.’ Snowden could also have seen information sent by British intelligence, Mr Baer said. ‘There’s a daily intelligence briefing which gives you a summary of chatter and intercepts and diplomatic communication. He could have easily given it to Russia. I think it is just horrendous.' Meanwhile, Snowden last week admitted that he was trained in espionage. He made the claim during an interview with Brian Williams on NBC. Snowden said: 'I was trained as a spy in sort of the traditional sense of the word, in that I lived and worked undercover overseas — pretending to work in a job that I’m not — and even being assigned a name that was not mine.' 'But I am a technical specialist. I am a technical expert. I don’t work with people. I don’t recruit agents. What I do is I put systems to work for the United States. And I’ve done that at all levels from — from the bottom on the ground all the way to the top.'","Moscow identified Edward Snowden as a possible defector in 2007 .

"The moment art changed forever and the Impressionist movement was born has been pinpointed thanks to science, a leading astrophysics expert has claimed. Professor Donald Olson believes his team of Texas State University researchers have calculated the exact point in time the sunrise in Claude Monet's Soleil Levant, or Impressions, Sunrise, appeared. That moment, he says, was 7.35am on 13 November, 1872. Monet's Impressions, Sunrise shows the port of Le Havre in the morning and gave rise to the name of the Impressionist movement. Researchers believe it was painted at 7.35am on 13 November, 1872 . Debate has raged for years over when the enormously-influential work was painted and whether the sun in the painting is rising or setting. The painting shows the port of Le Havre, in north-western France, in the morning. In the background, some of the ships anchor. Art historians say it gave rise to the name of the Impressionist movement which, in part, led to the creation of modern art. To find out when the sun was rising researchers used geographical analysis, astronomical calculations of the rising sun, tide levels and meteorological observations of the sea and the sky. The team also compiled the scant documentary evidence from the artist and visited the location, to more accurately pinpoint the potential date, The Independent reported. Professor Olson will present his findings in an essay published in the catalogue for an exhibition featuring the work at the Musée Marmottan Monet in Paris, which opens next month. French painter Claude Monet, who was born in 1840 and died in 1926, pictured in 1921 . Marianne Mathieu, deputy director and head of collections at the museum, said: 'We wanted to pay tribute to this very important painting. 'Much of the history and details about this iconic work were unknown. With these techniques we could uncover new information.' She added: 'I wanted to work with Don. He had done it before and on this did wonderful work.' The 19th century art movement originated in Paris during the 1870s and 1880s, in the face of opposition from the conventional art community who objected to the lack of sharp lines and contours, and artistic detail. Instead, Impressionist works focus on recording a moment and are characterised by thin, visible brush strokes. Among the most famous of the Impressionists are Edouard Manet, Pierre Auguste Renoir, Paul Cézanne, Alfred Sisley and Camille Pissarro. In October 1985, armed robbers made their way into the opened Musee Marmottan Monet and tore Impression, Sunrise as well as eight other paintings by Monet from the walls. They were recovered only five years later.","Monet's Impressions, Sunrise shows the port of Le Havre in the morning .

"Reverend Al Sharpton is leading a wave of outcry after a report suggested that investigators do not have enough evidence to charge a police officer over the shooting of Michael Brown. Details revealed by the New York Times included the first account of the shooting to come from Darren Wilson - who says he struggled with Brown in his squad car and shot the teen when he grabbed for his gun. Experts told the paper that they believe investigators do not have the evidence to prosecute Wilson on federal civil rights charges - meaning a grand jury could soon decide Wilson should not be tried over the killing. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Anger: Rev Al Sharpton launched an enraged attack on Darren Wilson for claiming he acted in self-defense . 'Same excuse': He likened the shooting to other slayings of black teenagers at the hands of white men . In his own version of events, the police officer told a grand jury he opened fire because the teenager was attacking him and he feared for his life. Wilson insists Brown viciously launched through the window of his police car, punching and scratching him repeatedly. Police officers are generally given more scope for lethal force if they reasonably believe that their life is in imminent danger. Eventually, Wilson said, he pulled his gun from the holster on his right hip, fired two shots, and one hit Brown's arm - leaving his blood smeared inside the car and on his uniform. The account stops there and fails to explain why Brown was shot a further four times outside the vehicle. Since no other witness had a clear vantage point from which to see the incident, legal experts warn Wilson's testimony will carry significant weight for the grand jury, a legal expert told MailOnline. Slamming the account as illogical, Sharpton today raged at his weekly National Action Network rally in Harlem that it is the 'same excuse' as all other shootings of black citizens by white men. 'It sounds like a Michael Dunn defense,' he said, referring to the Florida man who has been convicted of first-degree murder for shooting dead black teenager Jordan Davis. Dunn claimed he did it because Davis was playing music too loudly. 'It didn't work in Florida and it shouldn't work in Missouri,' Sharpton added. He spluttered: 'First of all, if you stopped him - Michael Brown and his friend - walking down the street, what led to the scuffle? Aftermath: This is the first picture of Darren Wilson standing over Michael Brown after shooting him dead . Claims: Wilson, pictured again surveying the body, insists he fired from inside the car during a tussle but his account did not explain why the unarmed teenager was then shot at least four times outside the vehicle . 'Secondly, how does he and you get in your car? You trying to do what by yourself?' Sharpton asked. 'Now, if I go with you with your story all the way to that - that Michael Brown was shot, gets up off you in the car - why are you trying to tell me that a man ran back at you when he knew you had the gun and you already shot him?' He added: 'We were involved in Trayvon Martin. We were supportive of Jordan Davis. 'The strange thing is that all of them used the same excuse...The only gun there was Darren Wilson's! Strange parallels with all of these cases.' His words were echoed by Mahatma Gandhi's grandson Dr Arun Gandhi who spoke today to condemn racism in St Louis as a source of the violence that has killed 110 people this year. He spoke to address hundreds of mothers gathered at a silent march outside St Louis County Justice Center today, where they held a four-minute silence for Michael Brown. 'We have looked at it only as racism, and racism is a byproduct of prejudice,' he said, St Louis Public Radio reported. 'Prejudice exists in every one of us, whether we are black, white, brown, yellow.' Nonetheless, a jury will now have the power to tell the state attorney that Wilson is innocent of civil rights abuses if they believe his claim that he was acting in self-defense. Peter Joy, a professor at the Washington University of Law in St Louis, told MailOnline the charge of civil rights abuse is a much higher standard than murder or manslaughter, as the 12 jury members will have to be certain Wilson intended to violate Brown's civil rights by shooting him dead. 'The civil rights abuses are even harder to prove than an underlying criminal conviction. The federal government does not step in to pursue a civil rights conviction unless they believe it was an intentional abuse. 'There are some criminal charges that don't involve that kind of mental state, like murder. 'For example anger. They can be guilty of acting knowingly and recklessly, but it is different to intentionally violating a civil right.' As a result, he said, they will need forensic evidence of damage to the car to disprove Wilson's account if they are to find him guilty. Duke University law professor James Coleman Jr told MailOnline an innocent verdict would 'totally undermine the St Louis criminal justice system'. 'If a grand jury accepts that every shot he fired at that kid was in self-defense that simply is not plausible,' he said. But he warned that prosecutor Robert McCulloch - who has been criticized for his strong ties with the police - will have a strong influence over their verdict. 'Pretty much every jury does what they are told. 'If the prosecutor is being wishy washy about this, it is very possible a grand jury won't indict him.' Determined to level charges against Wilson regardless of the jury's verdict, Benjamin L Crump, the Brown family's lawyer, rebuffed the leaked account. 'What the police say is not to be taken as gospel,' Mr. Crump told the New York Times. 'He can say what he wants to say in front of a jury. They can listen to all the evidence and the people can have it transparent so they know that the system works for everybody. 'The officer's going to say whatever he's going to say to justify killing an unarmed kid. 'Right now, they have this secret proceeding where nobody knows what's happening and nobody knows what's going on. 'No matter what happened in the car, Michael Brown ran away from him.' A number of witnesses agree that Brown and Wilson were embroiled in a physical fight through the car window, but few had an accurate vantage point to see what was happening. 'Self defense': Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson says he feared for his life as he shot Michael Brown . They insist, however, the teenager was trying to flee and holding up his hands. One passer-by, Tiffany Mitchell, is certain Brown was leaning away but Wilson kept pulling him closer. Another, Dorian Johnson, said Wilson grasped Brown's throat and then pulled out his gun threatening to shoot. They then heard shots fired from inside the SUV. There remains no account from witnesses or police of the final four shots fired. Next week, Al Sharpton will hold a four-day Michael Brown tribute in Ferguson October 31 to November 4 in reference to the four hours that the teenager's body was left lying on the street. According to Wilson's description of the August 9 shooting - revealed for the first time today - Brown made him fear for his life. Investigators are now examining the officer's claim that the teenager physically assaulted him as a grand jury considers whether he is guilty of a number of crimes including: first-degree murder, second-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter or involuntary manslaughter. City officials claim there is still not enough evidence to charge Wilson with violating civil rights. In September, Officer Wilson appeared  before a St Louis County grand jury, which was convened to determine whether there is probable cause that he committed a crime. His willingness to testify surprised many. However, his account of feeling vulnerable will be a significant boost in his favor as the grand jury considers its verdict before the deadline of January 7. Nine of the 12 jury members will have to vote against Wilson in order for charges to be leveled. They are expected to vote by mid-November. St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert P. McCulloch could have bypassed the grand jury stage and simply taken the case to trial by filing a charge against Wilson. He could also have filed a complaint to a judge who decides if there should be a trial. However, McCulloch chose to take the full investigation of Wilson's use of deadly force to the grand jury, leaving the 12 members to decide. According to the New York Times, the leaked account of his version of events did not come from the Ferguson Police Department or from officials whose activities are being investigated as part of the civil rights inquiry. People claiming to have witnessed the shooting have given wildly different accounts of what happened. Some have said that some the young man had his arms raised over his head while others claim that Wilson shot him while his back was turned and he was running. The police have maintained that the unarmed teen physically assaulted the officer and tried to get his gun. One witness, whose name has been withheld, from St. Louis, Missouri, told the grand jury that the teenager did not have his hands above his head when Wilson shot at him, but rather 'out to his sides.' He also said Brown 'staggered toward Wilson despite commands to stop' and that 'the two were about 20 to 25 feet apart when the last shots were fired.' Protests in Missouri have continued ever since the shooting amid claims it was unjustified - and an extreme example of police brutality in the town. Civil rights groups say Brown's death is part of a national epidemic in which a disproportionately high number of unarmed black men are fatally shot by white police officers, an allegation police deny. Officials said that the evidence given so far did not support civil rights charges against Officer Wilson. To press charges, the Justice Department would have to prove that he wilfully violated Brown's rights when he shot him.","Rev Al Sharpton slammed account claiming it doesn't make sense .

"Sir Alex Ferguson will resist the temptation to hit back at Roy Keane in print over the infamous bust-up that led to the Irishman leaving Manchester United under a cloud in November 2005. Keane has re-opened their war of words in his explosive new autobiography The Second Half in which he refers to Ferguson as ‘f****** p****’ over the incident. Coincidentally, the second instalment of the former United manager's autobiography, which was published last year, is being updated and released in paperback on October 23. Republic of Ireland assistant manager Roy Keane during squad training ahead of their Euro 2016 qualifier . Keane during training in the same week his autobiography stirred stories from his Manchester United career . Keane reopened his war of words with Sir Alex Ferguson in his new autobiography The Second Half . Keane referred to Ferguson as a 'f******* p****' in his autobiography but his former manager won't retaliate . However, sources at publishers Hodder & Stoughton say Ferguson will not be adding to his existing account of the rift with Keane. The additional chapter will focus on the year that followed his retirement as United manager and David Moyes’s ill-fated spell as his successor. Ferguson and Keane both describe how their relationship began to turn sour during a pre-season trip to Portugal, organised by Carlos Queiroz in the summer of 2005. Keane became embroiled in a row with United's Portuguese former No 2 and recalls: ‘Ferguson tried to intervene. '“That’s enough. I’ve had enough of all this”,’ he said. Keane retorted: “You as well gaffer. We need f*****g more from you. We need a bit more, gaffer. We’re slipping behind other teams”.’ The updated version of Sir Alex Ferguson's autobiography is out on October 23, but he will resist a backlash . The Irishman says he regrets ever apologising to the management for the way he left the club in 2005 . It came to a head when Keane criticised his team-mates in an interview for MUTV, which never aired. He was swiftly shown the door after being summoned to a meeting with Ferguson and then chief executive David Gill. ‘I said to Ferguson, “Can I play for somebody else?”,’ Keane writes. ‘And he said, “Yeah you can, cos we’re tearing up your contract”. So I thought, all right – I'll get fixed up. ‘I knew there’d be clubs in for me when the news got out. I said, “Yeah, I think we have come to the end”. I just thought, “F*****g p***k” – and I stood up and went, “Yeah. I’m off”.’ Keane returned to United some time later and said sorry to Ferguson but now wishes he hadn’t. ‘Afterwards, I was thinking, “I’m not sure why I f*****g apologised.” I just wanted to do the right thing.’ Keane (left) and Ferguson (right) met in the OId Trafford dugout as managers in September 2007 . Keane is now assistant manager at Aston Villa, working under former Scotland midfielder Paul Lambert . He also portrays Ferguson as a cold-hearted character and rates Brian Clough as a better manager for his career. ‘I worked under two great managers and I put Brian Clough ahead of Alex Ferguson for a simple reason. What was the most important thing in my football career? Brian Clough signing me. That kick started everything. ‘Different managers, both brilliant. I think Clough’s warmth was genuine, but with Ferguson it was pure business – everything is business. ‘If he was being nice I would think, “This is business, this.” He was driven and ruthless. That lack of warmth was his strength. United was a much bigger club than [Nottingham] Forest, but his coldness made him successful.’ Keane writes about the incident with Ferguson in his new autobiography The Second Half .

"ISIS positions in and around Kobane felt the full force of American airpower last night, as sustained bombing raids resulted in a series of spectacular explosions in the besieged Syrian town. The radical Islamic group has been dramatically pushed back from the town, having as recently as last week looked like it was about to drive out the last of the brave Kurdish fighters defending it. As a fresh round of airstrikes rained down, the US also ran a series of airdrops for the Kurdish resistance, dispatching weapons and medical supplies. Pyrotechnic tracer ammunition could be seen marking out ISIS targets in the town as the U.S. bombers flew overhead. Scroll down for video . In their sights: Pyrotechnic tracer rounds light up the night sky in Kobane as U.S. warplanes fly overhead . Direct hit: Moments later a ferocious explosion lit up the sky in the exact spot where the lines met . Destruction: Explosions ripped through the neighbourhood in a continued round of assaults . Fighting: A U.S. bombing raid sends flames and smoke into the air in the besieged Syrian border town of Kobane tonight. The renewed airstrikes came as Turkey opened its borders to let more Kurds join the fight . Blast: Smoke rises from the same area after the blast, one of hundreds of U.S. airstrikes in the conflict . Hit: A densely-packed area of Kobane is hit by a huge explosion as the battle for the frontier continued . Under attack: U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said today Kobane was at a 'crisis moment' as ISIS floods in . Surveying the destruction: Kurds watch the smoke rising over Kobane at sunset tonight from Turkish territory . The move came as Turkey announced that it will finally open its border to allow hundreds of Kurdish fighters into Kobane to join the fight against ISIS. Officials in the area hope that a final push will finally rid Kobane of ISIS, who were reported to have been reduced to just two strongholds at the weekend after being driven back by resurgent Kurdish fighters backed by US airpower. US Secretary of State John Kerry declared the besieged Syrian settlement was at a 'crisis moment', with huge numbers of ISIS militants flooding into the line of Western fire. During the evening of sustained airstrikes on ISIS targets, C-130 cargo planes made multiple drops of arms and medical equipment. Mr Kerry said the decision to carry out the airdrops was made because it would be 'irresponsible' and 'morally very difficult' not to support the Kurdish fighters. The move, on the same day as Turkey's opening of its borders, raised the question of whether the weapon drops were strategically timed to arm the new influx of soldiers. In a statement released last night, US Central Command said C-130 cargo planes made drops of arms and medical supplies which had been provided by Kurdish authorities in neighbouring Iraq. More than 200,000 people have fled Kobane (pictured today) into Turkey; now some will be allowed back . Huge numbers of ISIS militants are believed to be sweeping into the city in a bid to seize control from the Kurds . As the explosions (pictured) rippled through Kobane, the Kurdish fighters were armed with new U.S. drops . Mr Kerry said: 'ISIL is presenting itself in major numbers in this place called Kobane' The airdrops were intended to support continued resistance to ISIS as the Islamist extremist group attempts to gain control of Kobane. Speaking in Indonesia today, Mr Kerry told reporters that the administration understood ally Turkey's concerns about supplying the Kurds, who are linked to a Kurdish group that Ankara fiercely opposes. But he said the situation is such in the besieged town of Kobane that the resupplies were deemed absolutely necessary in a 'crisis moment'. 'Let me say very respectfully to our allies the Turks that we understand fully the fundamentals of their opposition and ours to any kind of terrorist group and particularly obviously the challenges they face with respect to the PKK,' Mr Kerry said. 'But we have undertaken a coalition effort to degrade and destroy ISIL and ISIL is presenting itself in major numbers in this place called Kobane,' he added using an alternative acronym for the terrorists. Besieged: A huge cloud of smoke is seen rising from a building in Kobane, which is currently being defended by Kurdish forces against the incursion of ISIS fighters . Fighting: Black smoke is seen rising from an ISIS-held building inside Kobane this afternoon . Conflict: The airdrops were intended to support continued resistance to ISIS as the Islamist extremist group attempts to gain control of Kobane .

A Turkish forces soldier rides on top of an armored vehicle as he patrols the Turkish-Syrian border today . Turkish military vehicles patrol the Turkish-Syrian border this afternoon as fighting continues to rage in Kobane . Turkey's foreign minister said his country is now helping Iraqi Kurdish forces cross into the Syrian border town of Kobane 'to give support' to fellow Kurdish fighters there. But Mevlüt Cavusoglu did not elaborate, and it was not immediately clear whether Turkey was actually allowing Kurdish fighters across the border into Syria yet after blocking them for so long. 'Iraq's Kurdish Regional Government announced that they are in cooperation with Turkey and the U.S.,' Mr Cavusoglu said. 'Actually, we are helping peshmerga forces to enter into Kobane to give support. Turkey has no wish see Kobane fall.' Hit: In a written statement, U.S. Central Command said its forces have conducted more than 135 airstrikes against ISIS in Kobane . Calm: Syrian Kurdish fighters are seen walking in northern Kobane this afternoon. The photograph was taken from across the border in Turkey . Hostile: One of the administration officials said the airdrops should be seen as a humanitarian move, saying US officials believe that if Kobane were to fall, ISIS militants would massacre Kurds in the town .

Loaded: The US military successfully completed its first series of airdrops to Kurdish military forces in Syria . Flight: An American warplane flies over Kobane just an hour after C-130 cargo aircraft dropped weapons . The unexpected development suggests Turkey may be softening its stance on the issue of helping the Syrian Kurds. It also raises the question of whether the American airdrops were coordinated to help arm what may turn out to be hundreds of additional Kurdish fighters flocking to help defeat ISIS in Kobane. Barack Obama called Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Saturday to discuss the situation in Syria and notify him of the plan to make airdrops, one U.S. administration official told reporters. He would not describe Erdogan's reaction but said U.S. officials are clear about Turkey's opposition to any moves that help Kurdish forces, whom Turkey views as an enemy.

According to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the 'large amount of weapons and ammunition' airdropped by U.S. planes has reached the main Kurdish militia in Kobane. The Kurdish fighters in Kobane have been picking up and moving the weapons since they were airdropped around dawn, said the Observatory, which has a network of activists on the ground. In recent days, much of the coalition strikes have focused around Kobane, which Islamic State group militants have been trying to seize since mid-September. Turkey has so far provided sanctuary to an estimated 200,000 Syrians fleeing from Kobane and dozens of nearby villages that were captured by the IS group.

Serena Shim, who worked for Iran's state-owned Press TV as Turkey correspondent, died in the city of Suruc after the car in which she was travelling reportedly collided with a 'heavy vehicle'. Shim's death came just days after she spoke on camera of her fears of being arrested, claiming Turkish intelligence agents had accused her of spying after one of her reports suggested ISIS militants were being smuggled back and forth over the Syrian border in the back of aid vehicles. Tragic: Serena Shim, who worked for Iran's state-owned Press TV as Turkey correspondent, died in the city of Suruc after the car in which she was travelling reportedly collided with a 'heavy vehicle' Shim, an American citizen of Lebanese origin, had been working in Turkey for Press TV - the Iranian state-owned television network. In a report published on the company's website, it is claimed she had been in a rental car on the way back to her hotel in the town of Suruc in Urfa Province when the 'suspicious' accident took place. Neither the 'heavy vehicle' nor the driver involved in the crash have been located after the incident, Press TV claimed, adding that her parents 'refused to believe' the crash had been an accident and are planning to pursue the matter legally. Press TV's account of the crash has been somewhat disputed by Turkish newspaper Hurriyet Daily News, however, who said the vehicle involved was a cement mixer and that the as-yet-unidentified driver had been arrested at the scene. Death: Serena Shim's death came just days after she spoke on camera of her fears of being arrested, claiming Turkish intelligence agents had accused her of spying . Only last Friday Shim was interviewed on camera by Press TV about her fears of being arrested by Turkish intelligence agencies. In the short interview she alleged that she had been approached and accused of spying after a report in which he said she claimed to have received images of Islamic State terrorists being smuggled over the Turkey-Syria in vehicles belonging to the World Food Organization and other aid groups. Shim described herself as 'surprised' at the accusation, 'because I have nothing to hide and I have never done anything aside my job.'","US intensified airstrikes on besieged town with overnight bombardment .

"A video shows the incredible moment a female Good Samaritan bravely defends a Papa John's store from looters during riots that turned parts of Ferguson, Missouri, into an urban warzone. The unarmed woman is seen using her hands to guide a masked man away from the storefront, after he starts punching the windows in an attempt to smash the glass. She places her body between the store and the man and appears to be trying to reason with the looter, who squares up to her and jabs his finger aggressively in her face. Scroll down for video . The masked man pushes the woman aggressively, before raising his fists at her, as she defends the store . The looter continues raining blows on the storefront, kicking the glass furiously. He is joined by a second man who shouts in her face, but she refuses to back down. Both looters seem to get angrier, and the masked man pushes the woman aggressively, before raising his fists at her. But he then backs off and is led away by the other man. In the background, a female voice can be heard shouting at the woman to 'move!' and telling her that 'this ain't your business.' Many at first thought the woman was an employee at Papa John's but that is not in fact the case. 'A lost of people thought it was the General Manager because we have a female GM,' store employee Jon Smith told MailOnline. He then added, 'We sent everyone home between 7:00 and 8:00 to be safe Monday night, and this happened after that.' He then said how much he admired the woman for protecting the store. 'For someone who has no vested interest to protect the store like that is amazing.' The woman's identity is still unknown, even to employees at Papa John's .

This as demonstrators in Ferguson broke windows at City Hall Tuesday night and set a squad car on fire, thought the protests were far less destructive than the previous night.. By the end of the night 45 people had been arrested in Ferguson, most for failure to disperse, though at least one person was taken in after being part of a group that was throwing smoke bombs, flares and frozen water bottles at a line of officers. Some protesters also threw rocks, tent poles, and bottles - some containing urine - at officers. It also came as tens of thousands of people in more than 170 cities across America - including Atlanta, Boston, Philadelphia, New York and Los Angeles, among others - were demonstrating against the long-awaited verdict for a second night. Wreckage: The Title Max across the street from Papa John's goes up in flames . Enraged protesters set fire to buildings, and looted businesses in an orgy of violence and destruction . Within 30 minutes of the news that a grand jury had decided a white police officer Darren Wilson would not face criminal charges for shooting dead 18-year-old Michael Brown, the suburb and surrounding areas of the city of St Louis erupted on Monday evening. At least one man died in a night of arson, looting, random gunfire and pitched battles, with heavily armed riot police unable to cope with the scale of the mayhem. Enraged protesters set fire to buildings and cars, and looted businesses in an orgy of violence and destruction. Protected by armored personnel carriers, police replied with tear gas and pepper spray, which made eyes and lungs burn.

This week, despite being bolstered by National Guard soldiers who had largely been deployed away from the trouble, overstretched police were unable to control the disorder, leaving streets lawless for long periods. During the violence a black 20-year-old shop assistant, DeAndre Joshua, was shot dead in his car in an apparent robbery. Fourteen other people were injured. In many cases, it was too dangerous for overstretched fire crews to reach the buildings and they were left to burn. Protesters take to the streets in Ferguson Tuesday night . Rows of parked vehicles were also set on fire with lighter fluid, including two police patrol cars. Rioters hurled bricks and rocks at officers. Sporadic gunfire - police counted 150 rounds - could be heard throughout the night. Some sounded like it came from automatic weapons, though the police insisted they had not used their own firearms. In the mayhem, looters moved in unmolested, robbing everything from an off licence to a branch of Toys R Us. A shop where Michael Brown had allegedly stolen some small cigars shortly before he was shot dead was also targeted by a crowd of looters. Others protested peacefully, chanting: ‘Hands up, don’t shoot. No justice, no peace.’ Some rioters paused to explain that, since they hadn’t got justice over Michael Brown, there would be no peace in this town.","Protesters in Ferguson, Missouri attempted to damage and potentially loot a Papa John's on Monday night .

"A wealthy and very brave Kurdish businessman is building his own to-scale replica of the White House just 62 miles from ISIS controlled territory. Worth upwards of $17 million, the approximation of 1600 Pennyslvania Avenue is the dream of Shihab N. Shihab, 58, who calls his would-be home, a bastion of 'beauty and simplicity' - although ISIS might call it 'target number one'. Currently taking shape in Erbil, the capital of the autonomous Iraqi region of Kurdistan, Shihab's White House is decked with 21-carat gold leaf on the banisters and Greek marble columns at the entrance. Good enough for Obama: The Kurdish businessman building his own version of the White House is spending upwards of $17 million on it . 'I get to keep my bedroom for the rest of my life while Obama has to vacate it when his term ends,' said Shihab, 58, to Bloomberg News last week. The home will be completed in four months and is taking shape in a part of Erbil that has been likened to Dubai for its booming real estate presence. A buyer offered to purchase the replica for $17 million, but Shihab refused. Undeterred by the barbaric fighting raging just one half hours drive away in ISIS controlled terriroty. 'It's not finished yet completely, there's no furniture and the interior construction still needs to be done,' said Tony Hozeph, a local property developer to ABC News.

So close: Erbil or Irbil is just one hour from ISIS controlled territory and has been saved from the barbaric Islamic State by US airstrikes . While security concerns remain, the intervention of the US Air Force seems to have deterred ISIS from be able to attack Kurdistan. Shihab meanwhile is confident his 3,000-square-meter, three story White House will be the toast of Erbil once it is finished. It has a 140-square-meter bedroom, five bathrooms and like the real White House its own private movie theater. However, there is one thing that the Kurdish White House will have that Obama does not.

"Former coach turned broadcaster Alan Jones defends controversial rugby player Kurtley Beale as 'one of the nicest people you'd ever meet' and says his latest controversies occurred because 'there's only so much you can cop.' The grand slam winning coach blasted the Australian Rugby Union, claiming controversial star Kurtley Beale is a 'symptom', not the 'disease' for the troubled Wallabies. The divisive radio personality says Australian Rugby Union is in a state of crisis and in 'absolute disarray'. Speaking at a Weary Dunlop rugby luncheon in Melbourne, Jones said the late war hero and former Wallaby would be 'disturbed' by the Wallabies' current state. Coach Ewen McKenzie is under pressure to keep his position while Beale must face a misconduct hearing after offensive text messages were inadvertently sent to the team's business manager Di Patston, who has since resigned. Scroll down for video . Alan Jones(left) has slammed Australian Rugby, saying the management is appalling and the staff (coach Ewen McKenzie, pictured right) are to blame for latest scandals - not controversial player Kurtley Beale . Beale also had a verbal argument with Patston en route to their recent Test in Argentina. Jones said he'd known Beale since his schoolboy days. 'He's one of the nicest people you'd ever meet and he's at all times unfailingly courteous but there comes a limit to what you can cop,' Jones said. 'And when you've had instructions barked at you by a business manager whose role has never been defined and you don't know how that person got the job... 'There's been too much of this and now as a result you want to make Beale the problem; Beale is the symptom he ain't the disease.' Alan Jones says Kurtley Beale is 'the nicest person' you could meet and his altercations with Di Patston occurred because 'there's a limit to how much you can cop... when you've had instructions barked at you by a business manager whose role has never been defined and you don't know how that person got the job' Jones said that players were confused and frustrated because of the large number of staff that were involved with the team. 'This is why they get into trouble because there are mixed messages,' Jones said. Due to celebrate next month the 30-year anniversary of his team's Bledisloe Cup series win over the All Blacks in Auckland, Jones said there needed to be changes. He said that man for man Australia were as good as New Zealand and capable of being world No.1. 'A fish stinks from the top and there's a smell out there about this wonderful product. 'Unless the board of the ARU and the CEO understand that, we're headed for even worse times. 'No one is going to want to contribute to a game which seems to be so appallingly managed.' Di Patson, left,resigned last week due to stress after two separate incidents with Kurtley Beale, right, which have led to Beale's suspension. He faces two separate misconduct hearings to decide his fate in rugby . At a press conference on Tuesday, Wallabies coach Ewen McKenzie revealed Ms Patston is currently on 'heavy medication' as she struggles to deal with the fallout after her altercations with Kurtley Beale . This week, Wallabies coach Ewen McKenzie spoke out in support of Di Patston, explaining how distressing the ordeal has been for the former business manager. 'I've got a former staff member out there who is heavily medicated, without a job and without job prospects,' he said. 'She did an outstanding job for me for a long period of time and made a massive contribution,' said McKenzie. 'But now (Di's) suddenly out there on the outer and under massive pressure.' Wallabies inside centre Christian Leali'ifano has also come out in support of Ms Patston, explaining that her resignation feels like 'losing a mother'. 'I sort of treated her as a mother and she was the same to me and she was like my sounding board if I had any troubles,' Leali'ifano said, according to SMH. Wallabies player Christian Leali'ifano has spoken out in support of Patston, explaining that her resignation 'feels like losing a mother' 'I can't fault anything she has done for the team. 'She worked countless hours and I was always going over to her and telling her to take a break but she always had things on to make this team better.' Ms Patston was reportedly recruited to her position with the Wallabies by McKenzie, after working as McKenzie's personal assistant whilst he was the coach of Queensland Reds. During the press conference, McKenzie explained he had a responsibility to ensure Ms Patston's wellbeing whilst working with the Wallabies, after bringing her. 'When you employ someone you bring them into that environment. But then when that environment then cast them out…' he said. 'I do feel responsible for her welfare so I can't then not take that responsibility.' 'She's out there on her own and it's a difficult place to be.' Kurtley Beale (left) allegedly sent the offensive text messages  in June. A susbsequent row between Beale and Ms Patston led to McKenzie (right) driving the then team business manager to the airport so she could leave the tour early . McKenzie also indicated that he is currently more concerned about Ms Patston's future than he is about his own, as he faces speculation that he will be outsted as Wallabies' coach. 'If you google (Di's) name it'll be difficult for her to get a job so I think it's been a really difficult time. 'The speculation about my job probably isn't front of mind for me. 'There's a lot of other issues going on at the moment and I like to make sure that I'm attending to things that are important. 'I monitor her welfare.' Wallabies captain Michael Hooper came out in Beale's defence on Sunday, saying the 25-year-old does not deserve to be sacked. 'I hope KB stays in rugby union and Australian Rugby Union,' said Hooper. 'We are backing Kurtley.I enjoy having him around the team and he is quality on the field.' The scandal has completely overshadowed the Wallabies' preparations for their third and final Bledisloe Cup test against world champions New Zealand in Brisbane on Saturday. Beale, 25, was also reportedly involved in a verbal altercation with Ms Patston while travelling with the team before the side's loss to Argentina .","Former coach Alan Jones defends controversial rugby player Kurtley Beale .

"A Missouri state senator has been arrested outside the police department in the embroiled city of Ferguson following another night of protests over the fatal police shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown in August. State Senator Jamilah Nasheed was taken into custody by Ferguson police officers late on Monday night, said St. Louis County Police spokesman Brian Schellman. TV footage showed the politician shouting ‘no justice,’ with replies of ‘no peace,’ from several protesters, as she was handcuffed along with another man. Senator Jamilah Nasheed shouted 'no justice' as she was handcuffed and arrested by Ferguson police on Monday night following another night of protests . Residents light candles at a memorial for 18-year-old Michael Brown on Canfield Street in Ferguson, Missouri, on Monday night . ‘They were told multiple times to leave the street, and they were arrested,’ Schellman said. St. Louis Alderman Antonio French tweeted not long after her arrest at around 8.30 p.m. that Nasheed was refusing bond and would be spending the night in jail. The senator is facing two charges and is being held in lieu of $600 bail at the St. Ann jail, said Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson. Eric Vickers, Nasheed’s chief of staff, said her arrest and subsequent jail stay are acts of civil disobedience. 'She wants to present this as an alternative to any sort of violent action,' he told St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Demonstrations have gripped the St. Louis area almost daily since the August 9 killing of unarmed black teenager, 18-year-old Michael Brown, by white police officer Darren Wilson. St. Louis Alderman Antonio French tweeted that Senator Nasheed was refusing bond and would be spending the night in jail . Fervent: A woman holds up a sign protesting the treatment of black people by law enforcement during Monday evening's protests . A grand jury is considering charges against Wilson, who has not spoken publicly about the matter. Protesters want Wilson arrested immediately and have called for the appointment of a special prosecutor. Brown's family have told MailOnline that Wilson will 'feel the wrath of God's vengeance' after the officer claimed he was acting in self defense. Sheryl Davis, Brown's aunt, said she believes the cop committed murder and will suffer retribution in a 'mighty way'. She described Wilson's actions as 'evil' and said will be punished by a higher power for what he did - even if he is cleared. Her comments are the most outspoken yet from Brown's family since Wilson's account of what happened was published in the New York Times at the weekend. The testimony - and alleged forensic evidence - has been described by experts as helpful to his defense and has provoked fresh outrage from the teenager's family and supporters. 'Self defense': Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson says he feared for his life as he shot Michael Brown . Anger: Sheryl Davis, left, with husband Eric, told MailOnline that Wilson will suffer retribution in a 'mighty way' Struggle: According to FBI analysis Brown's blood was found inside Officer Wilson's patrol car. the cop claims he wrestled with Brown in the car and was in fear of his life. But the account is disputed . Wilson shot dead Brown, 18, on August 9, in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis in Missouri, sparking nearly two weeks of violent protests and rioting. Unrest has continued since then as a grand jury decides whether it will indict Wilson. A decision is expected next month. Speaking to MailOnline Davis said: 'It's murder and they will feel and see the wrath of God's vengeance come upon them in a mighty way, just as he promised all who do evil in his sight.' Wilson's account gave the first insight into what he told the grand jury during his four-hour testimony in September, a process which is held in secret. He supposedly said that Brown pushed him back into his police SUV as he was trying to get out and pinned him down. At that point Wilson reached for his gun and fired two shots, one of which hit Brown - his blood was found inside the car. The account did not explain why Wilson then shot Brown five more times in the front as, according to some witnesses, he put his hands in the air to surrender. Jamilah Nasheed, center, pictured  protesting Michael Brown's shooting at a rally outside the White House, in Washington DC, on 28 August . Solidarity: Protesters are pictured here in Ferguson Monday night continuing a vigil for Michael Brown . Tensions: Police officers watch over the residents who have taken to the streets again, more than two months after the shooting . Brown's supporters are worried that Wilson is trying to exploit the law in Missouri which allows a police officer more leeway if they feel they are under threat. Wilson's account also flatly contradicts that of a number of witnesses including Brown's friend Dorian Johnson, who was standing next to him at the time. Johnson has said that Wilson was the aggressor and grabbed Brown's throat before pulling out his gun and threatening to shoot. But another witness, whose name has been withheld, has also reportedly told the grand jury that Brown did not have his hands above his head when Wilson shot him but instead they were 'out to his sides.' He also said Brown 'staggered toward Wilson despite commands to stop' and that 'the two were about 20 to 25 feet apart when the last shots were fired.' Among those who have already spoken out to attack Wilson's statement is Benjamin Crump, the attorney for Brown's family. Memorial: Neighbors wait by a memorial set up on Canfield Street, Ferugson - the spot where Brown was killed . He has said that Wilson's account should 'not be taken as gospel'. He said: 'He can say what he wants to say in front of a jury. They can listen to all the evidence and the people can have it transparent so they know that the system works for everybody. 'The officer's going to say whatever he's going to say to justify killing an unarmed kid.' The Rev Al Sharpton also called it a ‘Michael Dunn defense,' referring the Florida man who was convicted of shooting dead a black teenager because he was playing music too loudly. Sharpton has said: 'It didn't work in Florida and it shouldn't work in Missouri’. Residents of Ferguson fear that violence could return to their streets if Wilson is not indicted - which is a very real possibility. The New York Times reported that, according to officials with knowledge of the grand jury hearing, the forensic evidence does appear to support Wilson's account. Another issue is the potential civil rights prosecution brought by the federal government after Attorney General Eric Holder began an FBI investigation. Condemnation: Al Sharpton on Sunday hit out at Wilson's version of events. And the Brown family lawyer, Benjamin Crump, said: 'The officer's going to say whatever he's going to say to justify killing an unarmed kid' Peter Joy, a professor at the Washington University of Law in St Louis, has told MailOnline that a charge of civil rights abuse would be a much higher standard than murder or manslaughter. He said that this is because the jury would have to be certain Wilson intended to violate Brown's civil rights by shooting him dead. He said: 'The federal government does not step in to pursue a civil rights conviction unless they believe it was an intentional abuse. 'There are some criminal charges that don't involve that kind of mental state, like murder. 'For example anger. They can be guilty of acting knowingly and recklessly, but it is different to intentionally violating a civil right.'","State Senator Jamilah Nasheed was taken into custody on Monday night after being arrested during the latest night of protests .

"Bendigo councillor Mark Weragoda, who voted in favour of a controversial Mosque application, woke up on Thursday to find black balloons tied to the front of his business . For the past few weeks, residents of Bendigo, Victoria have been noticing black balloons appearing around the town tied to trees, houses and office fronts. The balloons are being left by a vocal group of anti-Islam protesters furious about plans to build a mosque in the regional city, after a controversial development proposal was debated and approved at a council meeting on Wednesday night. Councillors voted 6-2 to approve the $3 million development which will serve the 200 Muslim residents of East Bendigo and will include a mosque, sports hall, education facilities and retail premises. At the meeting protesters made a lot of noise, yelling that mosque would bring terrorists and Sharia Law to the town. On Thursday morning local councillor Mark Weragoda, who voted in favour of the application, woke up to find black balloons tied to the front of his business, where he also lives. 'I was a bit appalled really given the antics the anti-Muslim group made at the council chamber while we were debating,' Cr Weragoda, who is of Sri Lankan origin, told MailOnline. 'I thought ""This is obviously targeting me personally."" 'I've had a few phone calls and a few slanderous remarks at the chamber but anyway that's democracy I guess.' Cr Weragoda said the group protesting were a minority group trying to make 'as much noise as possible'. Scroll down for video . An artist's impression of the $3 million complex which will serve the 200 Muslim residents of East Bendigo and will include a mosque, sports hall, education facilities and retail premises . The development application received 254 objections, compared to Bendigo's total population of 110,000 . 'For instance they were so woeful, they wouldn't actually let any of the supportive councillors speak without yelling out every second,' he said. 'When I spoke they actually played some Muslim music.' Cr Weragoda added that the development application received 254 objections, compared to Bendigo's total population of 110,000. Cr Weragoda, who is originally from Sri Lanka, said he felt personally targeted by abuse from anti-mosque protesters . Of the 254 objections to the mosque, 40 came from East Bendigo residents, 163 came from Greater Bendigo and the rest came from elsewhere in Victoria or interstate. Two councillors, Elisa Chapman and Helen Leach, voted against the mosque. Cr Chapman told MailOnline: 'I'm not interested in speaking to media because they twist everything I say.' Cr Leach said she voted against the mosque and two other proposals 'purely on planning grounds'. 'I wasn't satisfied I could make a decision on that and two others, given the information in the report,' she told MailOnline. Cr Leach wanted to see more information on the neighbourhood impact, car parking and traffic issues. She added that she didn't think there was proper consultation with the community about the mosque. 'I don't know what all of the fuss is about really, I think it's just democratic process,' she said. Objectors to the mosque are likely to apply for a review of the mosque's planning application with the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal, which could stall the development for months . Two councillors, Elisa Chapman (left) and Helen Leach (right), voted against the mosque . 'I suppose people are concerned they haven't been heard and they think they should have been heard, and perhaps if they had they wouldn't have been so angry.' A spokesperson for community group Stop The Mosque In Bendigo, whose Facebook page has attracted more than 7700 likes, said it was opposed to the development because it is concerned the Muslim Brotherhood is trying to take over Australia for Islam. 'In my opinion a mosque preaching jihad and sedition decreases the security of any town,' they told MailOnline. At a council meeting on Wednesday night protesters made a lot of noise, yelling that mosque would bring terrorists and Sharia Law to the town . 'No mosque should be allowed to preach sedition of submission of unbelievers - but this is a core belief of Islam and why we at Stop the Mosque are so against it and spend energy educating others.' They added that the mosque's planning application had a 'litany of irregularities' and there was no community consultation. Bendigo resident Damian Wells, 35, said he was embarrassed that his town was being portrayed as racist and intolerant, so he started a Change.org petition to support multiculturalism and diversity in the regional city. An objection letter complied by community group Stop The Mosque In Bendigo . 'It's just totally unrepresentative of Bendigo and what Bendigo's about,' Mr Wells said. 'It really makes me get wound up to think about the possibly that we're seen as not a welcoming community.' '[The petition] is really about the silent majority standing up to this loud minority, which is just full of hatred and which is not representative of the Bendigo I love.' Consulting firm Tomkinson Group made the application to council on behalf of the Bendigo Islamic Association and the Australian Islamic Mission, which will fund the mosque. Tomkinson Group's Munshi Nawaz said objectors to the mosque were likely to apply for a review of the mosque's planning application with the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal, which could stall the development for months. 'It is very likely given that there are some major concerns among the community,' Mr Nawaz told MailOnline. 'In relation to this specific mosque application it's normal that people may have different views and they have the right to express them, it's all good.' Mr Nawaz said the Muslim population of Bendigo was growing quickly and the Bendigo Islamic Association anticipated this would continue. 'Roughly I can remember say five or six years ago there were approximately five to 10 Muslim families here, whereas now there are currently 50 who are permanently living in Bendigo,' he said.","Anti-Muslim protesters furious about plans to build a mosque in Bendigo .

Despite winning United we booed by their own supporters as the Old Trafford fans appear increasingly frustrated by the football lacking ambition, invention and dominance under van Gaal. Sportsmail's Mike Keegan gives you the lowdown on how the players performed at Old Trafford. MANCHESTER UNITED (4-1-2-1-2) David de Gea - 6.5 . Powerless to prevent Ings header. Reaction save to keep United ahead at 2-1. Remains in top form. Manchester United defender Phil Jones had to leave the field and be replaced early on with injury . Phil Jones - 5 . Outmuscled by Keane early on in what could have been a costly error and came off injured before five minutes had elapsed. Marcos Rojo - 6 . Defensively United’s best player on a night the bar was set about half an inch off the floor. An island of calm in a red sea of madness. Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo puts in a robust tackle on Burnley's Danny Ings . Jonny Evans - 5 . An uncomfortable night for the Northern Irishman. All over the shop and misguided header to give away a corner under no pressure summed it up. Paddy McNair - 6 . Full of energy going forward and stung Heaton's gloves from distance to win the corner that led to the opener. Struggled to deal with Kightly at times. Daley Blind - 6 . Like the kid in the playground who stays back while all his mates try and grab the glory before retiring with a nasty-looking cut. Argentine Angel di Maria holds off a challenge from George Boyd at Old Trafford on Wednesday evening . Angel di Maria - 6.5 . Guilty of giving possession away but laid Smalling’s second on a plate with an accurate cross and a menace with his pace on the break. Trickery too much for Arfield to win penalty. Wayne Rooney - 6 . United fans had called for him to be moved forwards from his role on the right of the diamond but when Blind came off he went backwards to holding midfielder. Rightly carded for foul on the excellent Ings. Wayne Rooney, deployed again in midfield, challenges for the ball with Burnley's David Jones at Old Trafford . Adnan Januzaj - 6 . Anonymous for long periods and seemed to try and take on one man too many. Neat shot easily held by Heaton but little joy for the tricky Belgian. Robin van Persie - 6 . Could not combine effectively with Falcao in a one-paced top two before smashing home his penalty. The 90 minutes will be welcome but can do much better than this. Radamel Falcao - 5.5 . Did well to nod back for Smalling to score but otherwise poor. Ball bounced off him more than once and left home support frustrated. Booked for what appeared to be a nasty elbow and hooked shortly after. Colombian striker Radamel Falcao (centre) was once again ineffective for Louis van Gaal's side . Subs . Chris Smalling (Jones 5) - 6 . Headed United in front 22 seconds after replacing Jones and repeated the trick to save Van Gaal’s side from a half-time booing. Nowhere near Ings and defensively poor. Only a six because of the goals. Ander Herrera (Blind 39) - 5.5 . Involved in a terrible mx-up with Smalling and failed to offer the muscle United desperately needed in the middle of the park. Will be grateful to be noticed, regardless. James Wilson (Falcao 74) - 6 . On long enough to pick up a yellow. A coincidence United improved after his arrival? Hit side-netting late on. United defender Chris Smalling scored a brace on Wednesday but didn't defend too confidently . BURNLEY (4-4-2) Tom Heaton - 6 . Perhaps could have caught McNair’s shot which led to the corner from which malling scored his first but could do little about the second. Kieran Trippier - 6.5 . Ex-City man surged down the right before teeing up Ings to equalise with a pinpoint cross and was a threat coming forward with superb delivery. Burnley defender Kieran Trippier battles for possession with Manchester United centre back Marcos Rojo . Jason Shackell - 6 . Coped well with the threat of Van Persie and Falcao and will wonder how he ended up on the losing side. Ben Mee - 6 . The ex-City man, born down the road in Sale, did well alongside Shackell but failed to get the result he would have craved. Michael Kightly - 6.5 . Wasted a chance to level when he dallied too long on a one-on-one with De Gea. Booked for a trip on a breaking Di Maria but had little option and blasted a great chance to level wide late on before being subbed. David Jones - 6.5 . Strong presence in the heart of midfield and was everything United lacked as Burnley bossed the first half for long periods. Clarets forward George Boyd was a constant menace for Manchester United to deal with at Old Trafford . George Boyd - 6 . Another Clarets nuisance, his cross had Smalling and Herrera at sixes and sevens as Burnley pressed for an equaliser at the start of the second half. Michael Keane - 6 . Almost a dream return when he outmuscled Jones earlier on but nodded a corner wide in front of the Stretford End.Outjumped by Smalling for the first. Scott Arfield - 6 . Booked for a needless challenge on Herrera but a strong physical presence in a midfield battle the visitors often dominated. Outwitted by Di Maria for penalty. Ashley Barnes - 6 . Sidefooted Kightly’s looping pass wide at the end of a sweeping move. Combined well with Ings but tired in the second half before being replaced by Jutkiewicz. English striker Danny Ings scored for Burnley and caused a host of problems for Manchester United . Danny Ings - 7.5 . Ghosted in to head Burnley level. Caused plenty of problems early on and set Barnes only for his strike partner to blaze over. Looks the real deal, really does. Subs . Sam Vokes (Kightly 86) - 5 . The game was gone by the time he entered the fray. Lukas Jutkiewicz (Barnes 90 +1) - 5 . Three-minute cameo not long enough to make an impact.","Louis van Gaal's side prevailed 3-1 at Old Trafford against Burnley .

"A woman found murdered at the Hong Kong apartment of British 'psycho banker' Rurik Jutting sent a message  saying she wanted to 'get out of here' just minutes before her death at the luxury complex. Seneng Mujiasih, who was also known as Jesse Lorena, is understood to have sent a text to a friend complaining of a 'really bad' smell inside the flat at 3.25am on Saturday November 1. At 3.45am police found Ms Mujiasih dying in the apartment with her throat slashed and knife wounds to her buttocks. They later discovered the mutilated corpse of another Indonesian sex worker, 25-year-old Sumatra Ningsih on Jutting's balcony, having been stuffed into a suitcase five days earlier. Yesterday Jutting, 29 - who  reportedly earned £350,00 a year as a banker - was pictured chuckling to himself in the back of a prison van after being sent for psychiatric tests to determine whether he is fit to stand trial, having appeared at a hearing earlier in the day charged with double murder. Tragic: Seneng Mujiasih (pictured) was found dying with her throat slashed on the sitting room floor of Rurik Jutting's apartment at 3.45am on Saturday November 1. 25 minutes earlier she sent a message to a friend raising concerns about being in the property and complaining of a 'really bad' smell . Butchered: At 3.45am police found Ms Mujiasih (right) dying in the apartment with her throat slashed and knife wounds to her buttocks. They later discovered the mutilated corpse of another Indonesian sex worker, 25-year-old Sumatra Ningsih (left) on Jutting's balcony, having been stuffed into a suitcase five days earlier . Luxury: Rurik Jutting's J Residence apartment building, where the bodies of the two women were found . Desperate: Seneng Mujiasih, who was also known as Jesse Lorena, is understood to have sent a text to a friend complaining of a 'really bad' smell inside the flat at 3.25am on Saturday November 1 . Ms Mujiasih was found dying with her throat slashed on the sitting room floor of Jutting's apartment at 3.45am,  Hong Kong police have revealed. Just 20 minutes earlier she had texted a friend to raise concerns over her visit, saying: 'Something smells really bad – I want to get out of here,' according to The Telegraph, who quoted a source close to the victim who asked not to be named. According to witnesses, Ms Mujiasih met Jutting at the nearby New Makati Pub & Disco sometime after 1.35am. Security footage shows the pair walking in the direction of his apartment shortly after 2.15am but what happened between their arrival and Ms Mujiasih's death remains a mystery. Although it remains unclear exactly why Ms Mujiasih wanted to leave the flat and what the 'really bad' smell was, other residents in the building are said to have complained of a 'dead animal' stench in the building's corridors. They were later told the smell was from the first victim's decomposing body. Yesterday, Jutting was today sent for psychiatric tests to determine if he is fit to stand trial for the murders of the two Indonesian prostitutes. The judge adjourned proceedings for two weeks while the psychiatric assessments are carried out and the banker was remanded in custody. According to witnesses, Seneng Mujiasih met Jutting at the nearby New Makati Pub & Disco sometime after 1.35am on Saturday morning. At 3.45am, she was found dying on the floor of his apartment building . Seeing the funny side: Yesterday Jutting, 29, was pictured chuckling to himself in the back of a prison van after being sent for psychiatric tests to determine whether he is fit to stand trial . Relaxed: The judge adjourned proceedings for two weeks while the psychiatric assessments are carried out . As he left court yesterday, Jutting was pictured chuckling in the back of a prison van surrounded by security guards wearing face masks. His lawyer, who did not speak during the hearing, said he had not yet agreed to take part in a police reconstruction at the crime scene, but did not rule out giving consent in future. Jutting, bearded and wearing black-rimmed glasses, remained impassive during the brief hearing at the Eastern Magistrate's court - his second appearance after being charged with the murders a week ago. He spoke only once to say 'I do' when the magistrate asked him whether he understood the arrangements. The case was 'adjourned... for two psychiatric reports on the defendant's fitness to plead', said principal magistrate Bina Chainrai. Remanded: A lawyer for Jutting, who did not speak during the hearing, said he had not yet agreed to take part in a police reconstruction at the crime scene, but did not rule out giving consent in future . Reports by two different doctors are required under Hong Kong law, said prosecutor Louise Wong who confirmed Jutting is being held at the maximum-security Siu Lam psychiatric centre. He will next appear in court on November 24. Following the hearing, Hong Kong solicitor Michael Vidler, who is also acting in Jutting's defence, said it could be months before a plea is entered. Sumarti Ningsih, 23, was found dead in a suitcase at Cambridge-educated Jutting's apartment in the former British colony's Wan Chai district earlier this month. Police had been called to the property on Halloween night and first found 29-year-old Seneng Mujiasih with wounds to her throat and buttocks. She died a short time later. Jutting moved to Hong Kong from London in July last year and is understood to have quit his highly-paid job at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in the days before the incident. Before leaving, he appeared to have set a sinister out of office automatic response for his email account at the bank. 'I am out of the office. Indefinitely. For urgent enquiries, or indeed any enquiries, please contact someone who is not an insane psychopath. For escalation please contact God, though suspect the devil will have custody (Last line only really worked if I had followed through),' the email read. Victim: Officers arrived at Jutting's blood-spattered 31st-floor apartment to find Jesse Lorena Ruri still alive despite gaping knife wounds to her throat and buttocks, but she died soon after . Sumarti Ningshi, a mother-of-one from Indonesia, was killed and stuffed into a suitcase at Jutting's flat . Grief: Jumiati, a cousin of Sumarti Ningsih, breaks down in tears as she holds her relative's photograph during a vigil to demand justice for the two murdered sex workers . More than 100 people attended a vigil for the two victims today, where many called for 'justice' for the women . His appearance in court yesterday came after an Indonesian nanny claimed she was allegedly invited back to his flat prior to the killings, but turned down his offer because she thought he was 'acting strangely'. The former public schoolboy was arrested after calling police to his £2,000-a-month high-rise flat following a night out at the Makati Pub & Disco. It was at the nightclub prior to his arrest that he reportedly began chatting to the mother-of-three, who has lived in the former British colony for four years and works as a nanny for a Hong Kong Chinese family. She claimed he approached her and a friend at the bar and said: 'Hi, girls. Where are you from? How old are you?' before buying them a round of drinks. After just minutes of chatting, he allegedly asked the nanny to return to his apartment with him but she said she denied his request because of his 'strange' behaviour. The woman, who is believed to be in her 30s, said she had witnessed Jutting pacing the club, occasionally grabbing women, before he approached her. From angelic schoolboy to bloated 'zombie' banker: Rurik Jutting pictured aged six at Wallop Preparatory School in Weybridge, Surrey in 1990 (left) and (right) while working as an investment trader in Hong Kong . Prior to his arrest, Jutting, who studied at Cambridge University, sent a message to his former girlfriend of six months, Ariane Guarin (pictured together above), asking her to fly over to Hong Kong to visit him for a week . Yesterday Ms Ningsih's cousin, Jumiati, said at the vigil that she had last seen her relative in August in their home village in Indonesia. Jumiati, who goes by only one name, said she called police about a week ago to report that her cousin was missing and was later asked to identify her body. 'I hope the killer will be punished and will feel the same as what has been done to my cousin,' she said at the vigil. Susiati, a friend of the victim, broke down in tears as she remembered Ms Ningsih, who had a five-year-old son back home. 'I have lost my best friend, and I am devastated,' she said. Several in the crowd held signs demanding reforms to Hong Kong and Indonesian laws governing how domestic workers can find work and how long they can stay in the city.","Seneng Mujiasih sent desperate message to friend minutes before murder .

"Still wish you were here? These are the holiday snaps that might fail to make anyone jealous as two fearless sightseers chase the perfect picture dangling off Europe's most famous buildings. Daredevils Vitaliy Raskalov, 20, and Vadim Makhorov, 24, have scaled some of the most recognisable tourist attractions on the planet and captured every moment. Fed up with queues and typical tours, the thrill-seeking duo have taken to the rooftops of Barcelona's Sagrada Familia, Cologne's Cathedral, and the Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame in Paris.Scroll down for video . Sky high: Travellers Vadim Makhorov (pictured dangling from the cathedral in Cologne) and Vitaliy Raskalov have scaled some of the world's most recognisable tourist attractions . Also taking on Giza's pyramids and Dubai's latest skyscrapers, the Russian travellers have been labelled 'The Skywalkers'. In just one month the pair, from Novosibirsk and Moscow, conquered 12 cities in seven countries including Stockholm, Warsaw, Prague, Frankfurt, Cologne, Amsterdam, Paris, Barcelona, Benidorm, Lisbon, Porto and Madrid and have seen the world like no one else. Mr Raskalov said: ‘We are just chasing the dream and always looking to go to the next highest point to see the things no one else gets to see. Oh la la! Mr Raskalov gets a view of the Eiffel Tower that few tourists in Paris get from a nearby rooftop. The pair capture every thrill-seeking moment on camera . Don't look down: The daredevils have gained the name 'Skywalkers' for photographs such as this, legs dangling from the Eiffel Tower at a dizzy height . From where you'll never be: The pair often stake out locations for hours, trying to find the best way to scale the structures and get past security, who have been known to have beaten the Russian travellers when they've caught them . ‘We don't mean to trespass or harm anyone one so we do often have to wait until the coast is clear. ‘But when you get there the views are spectacular and we want to keep going until we have mastered every city.’ The pair regularly stake out locations in the early hours of the morning, waiting for guards and security staff to turn their back. Mr Raskalov said: ‘Sometimes you can wait around all evening for the perfect chance, but you get there and then you are seen. Say cheese!

Trespass trapeze: Mr Makhorov holds his balance on a structure in Benidorm, one of many off-limits buildings in which the pair sneak past security guards to access . ‘When that happens and you are caught guards can beat you up quite a bit - but it's never too bad. ‘The views are worth it overall as you're taken to the top of the world with some of the most beautiful surroundings. ‘It's usually quite straightforward to scale roofs but in Russia it's a little bit more tricky - that's the main place where it can be dangerous.’ The death-defying ‘skywalkers’ have garnered a huge following online and insist they don't do it for the attention. Mr Makhorov said: ‘A lot of people really like what we do and say 'well done' but we're just focused on enjoying what we do and seeing the most spectacular cities from above. ‘You can get better than that - but we certainly wouldn't recommend everybody having a go because of course it is dangerous.’ Greetings from Benidorm: People and beach umbrellas look like ants from the skywalkers' view from the top, who now have a huge following online but insist they don't do it for the attention .

West Ham have yet to triumph in England's top division, but speaking in a Q&A with the Evening Standard, Sullivan cites Atletico Madrid's achievements in recent years as a reason for fans to be optimistic. Asked about how he saw the next five years for West Ham, Sullivan replied:  'I’d like to see us win the Premier League and then the Champions League. Yes, I know it’s unlikely but again, not impossible — look at Atletico Madrid. We can all dream. 'We are West Ham United, we’re a big club, one of four big clubs in London. We have some catching-up to do but we’ve closed the gap.' And Gold added: 'I would be disappointed if we don’t join the so-called top six within the next five years. We know the fanbase is there and it will grow when we move [to the Olympic Stadium]. 'This isn’t blind optimism.

"A U.S. judge sentenced a reputed lieutenant of captured Mexican drug lord Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman to 22 years in prison on Monday for his role in a $1 billion trafficking conspiracy, saying the stiff sentence should send a message to traffickers everywhere. Alfredo Vasquez-Hernandez, 59, stood unmoving in a Chicago courtroom, listening through a Spanish-speaking interpreter as Chief U.S. District Judge Ruben Castillo's tone became more stern. 'I tell you on behalf of all citizens of Chicago... we are tired of this drug trafficking,' he said. Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, the head of Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel, remains jailed in Mexico and Mexican authorities haven't said if they might extradite him to Chicago . The case is regarded as one of the U.S. government's most important against Mexican cartels. Guzman remains jailed in Mexico and Mexican authorities haven't said if they might extradite him to Chicago. Minutes before the sentence was imposed, a deferential Hernandez said he wanted to apologize. 'I ask you for forgiveness and for you to have pity on me,' he told the judge. Defense attorney Paul Brayman had asked that Castillo impose no more than the mandatory minimum 10-year sentence, saying 'anything more... is a death sentence' for his client. Hernandez pleaded guilty this year to possessing heroin and cocaine with intent to distribute. After the hearing, Hernandez's 43-year-old son, Gabriel Vasquez, told reporters the punishment was too harsh. Brothers: Margarito (left) and Pedro Flores (right) coordinated the distribution of cocaine out of Chicago, aided by a top lieutenant in the Sinaloa cartel . 'He's not the monster that everyone says he is,' an emotional Vasquez said. 'He's a family man.' Early at Monday's hearing, Castillo repeatedly asked the question: 'Who is this defendant?' Prosecutors relied on two Sinaloa cartel associates-turned-government witnesses, Pedro and Margarito Flores, to paint Hernandez as a close friend of Guzman who used his logistical skills to ship tons of drugs by train from Mexico to Chicago concealed amid furniture cargo. But the defense described him as an auto repairman who got caught up in a one-off drug deal. They also attacked the credibility of the Flores twins, saying they exaggerated Hernandez's role in the cartel to curry favor with prosecutors. After the hearing, Hernandez's 43-year-old son, Gabriel Vasquez, told reporters the punishment was too harsh . In the end, Castillo said there were legitimate questions about the believability of the twins. And he said he would not factor in whether Hernandez was or wasn't a ranking cartel figure, saying it would be unfair 'to let the entire specter of 'El Chapo' Guzman' influence the sentence. But Castillo also said he didn't accept the portrayal of Hernandez as someone who stumbled into the one deal for which he was extradited in 2012 from Mexico to Chicago. 'I'm not going to sit here... and think for one second this was the first time you happened to do this,' he said. Secret recordings and other evidence provided by the twin brothers in 2008 led to the Chicago indictments of Hernandez and 10 others, including Guzman and the Flores twins themselves. Hernandez was the first up for sentencing.

"Protesters have clashed with cops for a second night in St Louis, Missouri following the fatal shooting of black 18-year-old Vonderrit Myers Jr., who was gunned down by an off-duty police officer on Wednesday. Demonstrators burned American flags, blacked intersections, banged drums and taunted police as they gathered in Shaw to protest the teenager's death at the hands of the unidentified cop - just moments after they had met for a quiet candle-lit vigil for Myers. Police in riot gear lined up on a high street as protesters yelled abuse and profanities at the officers, who silently stood their ground - although some used pepper spray to force the crowd back. Police helicopters buzzed above the neighborhood. Some protesters burned the American flag, while others banged on drums and shouted: 'This is what democracy looks like!' Others slammed the sides of police vans. Shop windows were shattered and broken glass littered the street. Scroll down for videos . Anger: Protesters cheer after blocking an intersection following a vigil for 18-year-old Vonderrit Myers, who was gunned down on Wednesday night, in St. Louis, Missouri. Protesters clashed with police officers in the area for the second night on Thursday . Speaking out: A car blocks an intersection as protesters brandish an upside down American flag and film the police response . Standing up: Protesters block  the intersection with a car paying respects to Michael Brown, who was killed by an officer on August 9 . At the ready: Police wearing riot gear form a line to contain protesters on Thursday in response to the protesters lining the streets . Eventually the protesters backed off, moving a couple of blocks away, but riot police remained in the area. The protests came as accusations of racial profiling prompted calls for a federal investigation ahead of a weekend of planned rallies and civil disobedience. State and city leaders have urged the Justice Department to investigate Myers' death in the Shaw neighborhood Wednesday night, fearing he was targeted because he was black. Police say the white officer, who was patrolling the area for a private security firm, had approached the teen and his friends because they looked suspicious, then chased him because it appeared he had a gun. He says Myers shot first  - but the teen's parents say he was unarmed. 'This here was racial profiling turned deadly,' state Senator Jamilah Nasheed, a St. Louis Democrat, said at a news conference Thursday. Myers' death comes two months after the August 9 fatal shooting of Michael Brown, a black unarmed 18-year-old, by a white police officer in nearby Ferguson. Brown's killing sparked dozens of often violent protests in the St. Louis suburb. A state grand jury is deciding whether Officer Darren Wilson will face charges in his death. Killed: Teenager Vonderrit Myers, left, was shot by an off-duty officer just miles from where Michael Brown, right, was killed . Outrage: Protesters lock arms as they block a street on Thursday in the second night of protests following Myers' death on Wednesday . Clash: Police officers in riot gear stand at the ready as they face protesters in south St Louis following the death of the teen . Fighting back: A woman who declined to give her name has water and milk poured over her face while laying on a sidewalk after she said she was pepper sprayed by St. Louis riot police. Police used pepper spray to keep the lines of protesters back . Protests: Police have not named the 32-year-old police officer who shot Myers but insisted the teenager opened fire on him first . Making noise: Demonstrators march through the streets protesting the killing as the area struggles to heal after the death of Brown . Protest organizers say thousands of activists from around the country are expected to come to the St. Louis area for four days of rallies, marches and civil disobedience to protest the Ferguson shooting, racial profiling and police violence. The events, which start Friday and include a march Saturday in downtown St. Louis, have taken on added urgency in the wake of Myers' death. 'This is a racial powder keg,' said Jerryl Christmas, a St. Louis attorney who was among more than 20 black leaders who joined Nasheed at a news conference Thursday outside police headquarters. 'All this is going to do is escalate the situation.' Police say Myers was both armed and aggressive, using a stolen gun to shoot at the officer. Syreeta Myers said her son was holding a sandwich, not a gun. 'Police lie. They lied about Michael Brown, too,' she told The Associated Press by phone Thursday. St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson said the officer spotted Myers and two other males at around 7:30 p.m. on Wednesday while working a security job and patrolling near the Missouri Botanical Gardens. Shattered relations: Demonstrators occupy streets in defense of the recent killings of black teenagers carried out by cops . On guard: The 32-year-old police officer, who is white, has been placed on administrative leave for shooting the teenager . Violence: A police officer stands guard in front of a damaged storefront during the protest, which followed a vigil for Myers . Demonstrators: Protesters hold up their hands in an exclamation of 'don't shoot!' to show they are unarmed like Michael Brown . Dotson said the officer, who was off-duty but wearing his uniform, became suspicious when one of them started to run. He chased them, first in his car and then on foot, Dotson said. During the chase, he got into a physical altercation with Myers, who ran up a hill, turned and fired at the officer, the chief said. The officer, who wasn't hurt, shot back. Ballistic evidence shows Myers fired three shots before his gun jammed, Dotson said, adding that where they found the rounds indicate that he had been shooting in the direction of the officer. Police said they recovered the 9 mm gun, which was reported stolen on September 26. The officer fired off 17 rounds. Preliminary autopsy results show a shot to the head killed Myers, according to medical examiner Dr. Michael Graham. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that Graham said Myers was shot six or seven times in the lower extremities and the fatal shot entered his right cheek. Authorities have not released the name of the 32-year-old officer, who has been with the police department for six years. He is on paid administrative leave, pending the outcome of an investigation. All quiet: Earlier on Thursday, the community paid tribute to Vonderrit Myers at a candle-lit vigil at the Shaw Market . Missed: Jackie Williams, Myers' uncle, joins hands in a prayer before the vigil at the Shaw Market, where Myers went before his death . Pain: Family members attend a vigil on Thursday evening before another night of violence erupted in the south of the city . Heartbroken: The grandmother of 18-year-old Vonderrit Myers Jr. is comforted during the candlelight vigil for her grandson . Remembered: Mourners light candles and place gifts and balloons at a vigil for the slain 18-year-old on Thursday night . An attorney for the officer told the newspaper that his client served with the U.S. Marines in Iraq and was 'shaken up' by the incident. He called claims that Myers was carrying a sandwich, not a gun, 'ridiculous'. Surveillance footage released on Thursday night showed the teenager - who was wearing a monitoring ankle bracelet as part of his bail conditions - buying a sandwich with his two friends at Shaw Market in Shaw. The footage does not show any sign of a gun. Online court documents show that Myers was free on bond when he was killed. He had been charged with the unlawful use of a weapon, a felony, and misdemeanor resisting arrest in June. Myers' was the third fatal shooting of a black male by St. Louis-area police since Brown's death. 'It's imperative that we began to heal this community,' Nasheed said. 'This community has been broken down. We have too many deaths at the hands of police officers.'","Hundreds of protesters blocked intersections, burned American flags, banged drums and taunted police as they demonstrated in the streets of south St Louis, Missouri on Thursday night .

"Nearly 100,000 people have signed a petition calling for the Spanish health minister to resign over her order to put down the beloved pet dog of the nurse who beat Ebola. Teresa Romero Ramos survived the deadly virus after she became the first person to contract it outside Africa while treating two infected missionaries. However, while she and her husband were in quarantine, Spanish authorities put down the family dog Excalibur on October 8 - claiming it could have spread the disease. Anger: Nearly 100,000 people have signed a petition calling for the Spanish health minister to resign over her order to put down Exclaibur,  the beloved pet dog of nurse Teresa Romero Ramos who survived Ebola . Excalibur's death provoked widespread protest among animal rights groups, with angry demonstrators taking to the streets of Madrid, calling for the resignation of the country's health minister Ana Mato. Now campaign group Partido Animalista, or PACMA, have presented a petition signed by nearly 100,000 people to the Spanish parliament urging her to quit, along with Madrid health officials Javier Rodriguez and Julio Zarco. However, the Spanish government have rejected the petition and she will remain in office. Health Minister: Campaign group Partido Animalista have presented  the petition  to the Spanish parliament urging Ana Mato (pictured) to quit . Mrs Romero Ramos, 44, who was placed in quarantine on October 6 after her Ebola diagnosis, has described learning of the death of her pet as the worst part of her ordeal. The animal was put to sleep inside Mrs Romero Ramos’s home, which was disinfected before the animal’s body was taken away in a white van to a nearby incinerator. The decision to put down Excalibur, without testing the animal to see whether it was infected, caused widespread protests. Demonstrators who mounted a vigil outside to try to stop the move shouted ‘murderers’ and several threw themselves on the ground as the vehicle left. Some 300,000 people had already signed a petition urging authorities to spare Excalibur. Twitter was awash with photographs of dogs, cats and birds which were posted alongside the hashtag 'SalvemosAExcalibur' – Spanish for 'Let's save Excalibur'. 'Teresa's dog Excalibur was sacrificed despite the opposition of her owners, thousands of citizens and experts, without evening knowing if it has been infected (with Ebola) and knowing that there are no studies which show that Ebola can be transmitted from dogs to humans,' Pacma said in a statement, according to news website The Local. Many people in Spain felt that the dog's demise was a reflection of how the country's authorities handled Mrs Romero Ramos's disease, with a string of mistakes by health co-ordinators. Mrs Romero Ramos caught Ebola after treating Spanish missionary Manuel Garcia Viejo, 69, who died on September 25 after being infected with the disease while he treated patients in Sierra Leone. She has admitted touching her face with her gloves as she took off a protective suit after leaving the room of one of the priests. Demonstration: The decision to put down Excalibur, without testing the animal to see whether it was infected, caused widespread protests . Protest: Jose Ramon (centre, in black), Mrs Romero Ramos's brother holds a banner along with other protesters that reads 'We demand authorities to respect profesionals. All with Teresa' in Madrid . Ms Mato initially faced calls for her resignation after it emerged that Mrs Romero Ramos had complained of feeling unwell six days before she was eventually admitted to hospital. She was rushed to hospital by unprotected paramedics in a normal ambulance only taken out of service 12 hours later and found out she had Ebola by reading a Spanish newspaper website as she waited to be quarantined. Her home in Alcorcon, near Madrid, that she shares with husband Javier Limon Romero who was also quarantined, was not disinfected until October 8, two days after her diagnosis. Another 13 people who had come into contact with her for 21 days - the incubation period for the disease - though all have now been cleared. Recovery: Mrs Romero Ramos was treated with a drip of human serum containing antibodies from Ebola sufferers who had survived the disease . Query: At a news conference last week, her husband Javier Limon Romero questioned why the decision had been taken, saying the animal had not been to blame 'for anything' Mrs Romero Ramos was treated with a drip of human serum containing antibodies from Ebola sufferers who had survived the disease, and other drugs which a government spokesman declined to name. Mrs Romero Ramis said: 'The worst part was in regard to my dog. Now I'm going to get a puppy. A little Excalibur.' Mrs Romero has tested negative for the infection twice in the last week, with 48 hours between each test, but will remain in hospital in Madrid as a precaution until she is fully recovered. Speaking about her recovery, she added: 'I feel newborn, that is how I feel. I have had a very hard time. I told [my family] I was feeling very bad. 'I told them that I was sick, that I was feeling awful. But I also told them to stay calm. 'What they do is to cheer me up. They tell me they are longing to take off their protective suits to hug and kiss me. 'They cheer me up constantly and ask my what I need all the time. I am thankful to death for them.' At a news conference last week, her husband questioned why the decision had been taken, saying the animal had not been to blame 'for anything'. Earlier this week he described the animal as 'the son we never had', and adding that authorities had given him no chance to argue against the decision. In the U.S. a dog belonging to a nurse infected with Ebola was quarantined and tested negative, before being released.","Teresa Romero Ramos contracted virus while treating  infected missionaries .

"Pope Francis warned during a visit to Albania today that religion can never be used to justify violence, making apparent reference to the bloodshed wreaked by the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. 'Let no one consider themselves to be the armour of God while planning and carrying out acts of violence and oppression,' the pontiff said in speech at the presidential palace in Tirana in front of Albania's leaders. 'May no one use religion as a pretext for actions against human dignity and against fundamental rights,' he said. 'To kill in the name of God is a grave sacrilege. To discriminate in the name of God is inhuman.' Scroll down for video . Pope Francis arrives at Tirana's Mother Teresa international airport this morning to begin his day-long visit . The Pope touched down in Albania this morning for a 11-hour visit with security tight amid threats from Islamic State militants. While the Vatican insisted no special measures were being taken, Albania's Interior Ministry promised 'maximum' protection from 2,500 police and beefed-up patrols at border crossings. Francis' interactions with the crowds were also much reduced compared to his previous foreign trips. His open-topped vehicle sped down Tirana's main boulevard, not stopping once for him to greet the faithful, as is his norm. He said: 'All believers must be particularly vigilant so that, in living out with conviction our religious and ethical code, we may always express the mystery we intend to honor. 'This means that all those forms which present a distorted use of religion must be firmly refuted as false since they are unworthy of God or humanity.' Francis has said it was legitimate to use force to stop the Islamic extremists, but that the international community should be consulted on how to do so. Pope Francis has used the visit as an opportunity to denounce how religion has been 'perverted' to justify violence. Francis told Prime Minister Edi Rama at the start of his 11-hour visit Sunday that Albania's inter-religious harmony was an 'inspiring example' for the world, showing that Christian-Muslim coexistence was not only possible but beneficial for a country's development. He said: 'This is especially the case in these times in which authentic religious spirit is being perverted by extremist groups, and where religious differences are being distorted and instrumentalized.' Snipers watch on from a building roof as crowds gather below for the Holy Mass which will take place today . Pope Francis greets the media during an airborne press conference on his flight to Albania this morning . It was reported Albanian law enforcement had flagged to Interpol concerns that Muslim militants who trained in Iraq and Syria had returned and might pose a threat to Pope Francis. The Vatican has downplayed the reports, and Pope Francis has used the same open-topped vehicle he uses in St. Peter's Square. That said, even at the Vatican security has been beefed-up in recent days: More barricades and police were out in force during Francis' weekly general audience this past week and Italian media reported security had been doubled. Albanian police said they had the situation under control, though security was tight Sunday: People attending the pope's Mass were told to avoid wearing heavy clothing since they would be checked by police and not to bring bags, suitcases or glass bottles. 'There is no threat to the pope's security. We have undertaken all the measures and everything will go well,' police chief Artan Didi told reporters after a meeting with Interior Minister Saimir Tahiri on final security arrangements. The Pope bends down to kiss a baby as he makes his way through the crowds upon his arrival in Albania . Thousands turned out to the streets this morning for Mass with Pope Francis . Left, a police sniffer dog inspects the podium where Pope Francis will be seated for the Holy Mass, while right, the greets the crowds who have gathered to see him . It is Francis' first visit to a majority Muslim nation since the Islamic State crackdown on Christians in Iraq. During his visit, he will address Albanian authorities and an inter-religious gathering, celebrate Mass in a square named for Albania's most famous Catholic - Mother Teresa - and greet children cared for by charitable groups. The capital's main Boulevard Martyrs of the Nation was decorated with Albanian and Vatican flags, as well as pictures of 40 Catholic priests who were persecuted or executed under Stalinist dictator Enver Hoxha, who declared Albania the world's first atheist state in 1967. During this time, hundreds of priests and imams were jailed, scores executed. Francis paid tribute to these martyrs and those from other faiths, saying they showed witness to their faith even under persecution. 'Recalling the decades of atrocious suffering and harsh persecutions against Catholics, Orthodox and Muslims, we can say that Albania was a land of martyrs,' he said in his homily. Deviating from his text, Francis thanked Albanians for their ancestors' sacrifice, recalling the national symbol of the eagle. 'Do not forget your wounds, but don't avenge them,' he said. 'Go forward, flying on the hopes of a great future.' Muslims make up about 59 percent of the population, with Catholics amounting to 10 percent and Orthodox Christians just under that.

Crowds awaiting the Pope's appearance this morning where he will address an interreligious gathering . Pope Francis and Albanian President Bujar Nishani pictured side by side just after he first arrived in the country . The Pope's decision to visit tiny Albania before any major European capital is in keeping with his desire for the Catholic Church to go to the 'periphery'. Albania is seeking European Union membership and his visit comes just a few weeks before he delivers a major speech to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. The visit also affords him a chance to visit a majority Muslim nation at a time when Christians are being persecuted, killed and forced from their homes by the Islamic State group in northern Iraq. The Vatican has voiced mounting concern about the exodus of Christians from lands where Christian communities have existed for 2,000 years. Last month the Pope, who has often condemned the concept of war in God's name, said it would be legitimate for the international community to use force to stop 'unjust aggression' by Islamic State militants who have killed or displaced thousands of people in Iraq and Syria, many of them Christians. Despite some concerns over his safety, Pope Francis eagerly engaged with the Albanian crowds . Here he is carried through the crowd on his specially designed car known as the Popemobile .

"The Premier League is in full swing and fans across the country will have firm opinions on the best and worst performers so far this season. Courtesy of the EA Sports Player Performance Index, Sportsmail can reveal exactly which players have performed the best during the first two months of the current campaign. As expected, it is Chelsea - currently top of the Premier League with six wins from their opening seven fixtures - who hold the top three positions in the Player Performance Index rankings. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Two of the top ten players starring for their clubs in training . Chelsea's Diego Costa has settled into the Premier League very quickly and been on fire this season . Top goalscorer Diego Costa, who has netted nine times already since his summer arrival from Atletico Madrid, tops the charts followed by team-mates Eden Hazard and Cesc Fabregas who has assisted his Spain colleague four times. Raheem Sterling, who came off the bench in England's win over Estonia on Sunday, is fourth in the rankings with a PPI score of 172 followed by Swansea midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson on 168 and Manchester City frontman Sergio Aguero on 166. Southampton's Graziano Pelle, who arrived at St Mary's in the summer at a time when Morgan Schneiderlin wanted to leave the South Coast, sits seventh whilst his new French team-mate, who ended up staying with Ronald Koeman's side, is ninth. Young West Brom striker Saido Berahino, currently the highest English goalscorer, is eighth on the list following an impressive start. Leicester attacker Leonardo Ulloa, who has scored against Man United, Arsenal and Everton already this season, completes the top 10. Away from the highest ranking players, Mesut Ozil may have been criticised for some of his performances so far this season but the German international has actually been Arsenal's second best player behind fellow midfielder Aaron Ramsey. Alexis Sanchez, the Gunners' £30million summer signing from Barcelona, has been their third-best player with the Chilean's stand-out moment being a stunning volley in September's 2-2 draw against Manchester City. Wayne Rooney is ranked as Manchester United's second best player, but does not make the top 10 . Yaya Toure is yet to hit top form for Manchester City this season but is still their third best player . Another player to arrive in England from La Liga, Angel di Maria, tops the Manchester United charts with a score of 132. The Argentina midfielder became English football's most expensive player following his £60m switch to Old Trafford from Real Madrid and has scored three goals in five appearances for the Red Devils. Wayne Rooney, named captain at the start of the season by new United boss Louis van Gaal, is second among United's 'Gaalacticos' with Robin van Persie third. Jordan Henderson has been one of Liverpool's best players this season and scored against West Brom . Alexis Sanchez has been Arsenal's third best player so far this season according to the stats . Looking at the other half of Manchester, Yaya Toure, who is yet to hit top form this season, is Manchester City's third best player behind Spaniard David Silva who lies 13th overall in the Premier League standings. Jordan Henderson and Steven Gerrard make up Liverpool's top three along with Sterling while Tottenham's best performers include Emmanuel Adebayor and Nacer Chadli - two players who struggled for spells last term. Christian Eriksen has been Spurs' standout man. Everton frontman Steven Naismith, signed on a free transfer from Rangers in 2012, has outperformed the Toffees' £28million summer signing Romelu Lukaku. The Scotland forward scored in every one of Everton's opening three games while Lukaku has struggled for form since arriving permanently at Goodison Park.

"Click here for what Sir Alex Ferguson had to say in his update book in defence of Hammers boss Sam Allardyce's style and how he asked for an explanation of what exactly is the West Ham way. Sir Alex Ferguson comments on the 'West Ham way' in his updated autobiography  and calls the notion held dear by fans a myth. He writes: 'I hope that before I die someone can explain the 'West Ham way'. 'What is it? They last won a trophy in 1980, the FA Cup.' Sportsmail asked Sean Whetstone of West Ham fan website West Ham Till I Die for his reaction to Ferguson's comments and to meet the former Manchester United manager's request. Sir Alex Ferguson's mocking of the 'West Ham way' is more about selling his book than it is supporting his old mate Sam Allardyce. He is being controversial for the sake of it to gain free publicity and to support his habit of buying expensive wine for his luxury cellar collection. Fergie has a very short memory; the West Ham way was beating Manchester United 4-0 on a snowy December night in 2010 when Jonathan Spector and Carlton Cole were the unlikely heroes, scoring two goals apiece. Sir Alex Ferguson (right) defends Sam Allardyce (left) and says the 'West Ham way' is a myth in his book . For me, the 'West Ham way' is about attacking football; going out to attack the opposition at all times, trying to score at every opportunity, never sitting back in an attempt to frustrate, but instead going for the jugular  regardless of whether you're home or away. A fundamental part of the 'West Ham way' is central defenders bringing the ball out from the back. That started with Hammers and England legend Bobby Moore, and continued through Alvin Martin, Tony Gale, Slaven Bilic and Rio Ferdinand. We also had attacking full backs who would overlap and get forward, best exemplified by John Bond, Noel Cantwell, Billy Bonds, Frank Lampard Senior, Julian Dicks and Ray Stewart. West Ham's Jonathan Spector celebrates his first of two goals in their 2010 win over Manchester United . Carlton Cole was the other hero that night with a double in their 4-0 League Cup demolition of United . The cavalier style of the 'West Ham way' made us vulnerable and is one of the reasons we used to concede so many goals - even with Bobby Moore in the centre of defence. This season many West Ham fans will say the 'West Ham way' has returned. New signings Aaron Cresswell, Carl Jenkinson, Diafra Sakho, Enner Valencia, Alex Song, Morgan Amalfitano and Cheikhou Kouyate have added a dimension we have lacked in recent seasons under  Allardyce. This new injection of pace, skill and quality, together with excellent form of Stewart Downing and Mark Noble, has made West Ham a joy to watch again and is a major reason why we are fourth in the Premier League. In form Stewart Downing (left) and new sensation Enner Valencia (right) are showing the way for Hammers . Enner Valencia cracks an audacious shot to equalise against Hull in a hard-fought 2-2 draw . But the West Ham way is not all about results. As Hammers we enjoyed the hard-fought 2-2 draw at Hull City and the narrow 2-1 defeat at Old Trafford. In both those matches we gave it a go and tried our best. No false nines or 11 men behind the ball - we went for it - and that is what we will expect on Saturday lunchtime as we face second-placed Manchester City at home. The West Ham way is fundamental to the club's identity. Former West Ham and England manager Ron Greenwood eloquently explained the West Ham way in 1977 when he said: 'The crowds at West Ham haven't been rewarded by results but keep turning up because of the good football they see. Ferguson pointed out that West Ham's last major trophy came in 1980, when they won the FA Cup . 'Other clubs will suffer from the old bugbear that results count more than anything. This has been the ruination of English football.' I am happy to give Fergie an explanation of the West Ham way! Maybe now he will concentrate more on the mess he left behind at Manchester United when he retired and leave the comments about West Ham and their style of play out of further updates of his book.

Residents in locations including Buffalo, Cheektowaga, Clarence and as far north as Niagara Falls  took to social media to report the unusual noise at around 4:45 p.m. EST. People described it as loud enough to shake their homes and rattle windows. Scroll down for audio of the boom . As the same time as a loud boom was reported by a number of people in upstate New York on Saturday afternoon as a similar noise was heard more than 3,000 miles away by people throughout the UK . One resident in Alden, New York, took the noise as clearly a sign of extra terrestrial life . 'Just heard an explosion in Clarence that shook our house. Anyone else feel it? Our neighbors all felt it too,' wrote Lydia Von on the WGRZ Facebook page. For one resident in Alden, the noise was clearly a sign of extra terrestrial life. 'I was at home when a LARGE BOOM sound accrued. My house shook. Everyone in town heard and felt it. Some surroundings towns felt it too. There is no explanation,' the unnamed person wrote on UFO Stalker. State police received numerous calls about the loud boom, but have no idea what caused it. Meteorologists at the National Weather Service office on the grounds of the Buffalo International Airport did not report hearing or feeling anything at their office and do not believe that there could be a weather-related explanation. FAA personnel at the control tower did not report seeing or hearing anything either. One possible explanation is that the loud noise and ground shaking could have been a meteorite breaking up in the atmosphere, which would result in a sonic boom . Residents in upstate New York described the noise as loud enough to shake their homes and rattle windows. One possible explanation is that the loud noise and ground shaking could have been a meteorite breaking up in the atmosphere, which would result in a sonic boom. The U.S. Geological Survey did not report any seismic activity or earthquakes in the area at the time of the shaking, although a small earthquake did take place just two hours later. The magnitude 1.5 quake was centered about four miles west of Lockport and happened at 6:27 p.m. local time. But Jana Pursley, a geophysicist with the USGS in Colorado, told WGRZ that it would be impossible to attribute the reported noises to the Lockport earthquake hours later. Any earthquake that registers 2.0 or less on the Richter scale is a microearthquake and no damaged was reported as a result of the quake, according to law enforcement agencies. A loud boom was reported by a number of residents in upstate New York on Saturday afternoon in locations including Buffalo (pictured), Cheektowaga, Clarence and as far north as Niagara Falls . At the same time as residents in New York State reported hearing noises, hundreds of Twitter users in the UK reported hearing similar sounds - that also shook their windows. An audio recording of the 'loud bangs', taken by a woman as she sat at home in Croydon, south London, might shed light on what is really behind the unexplained noise. Some people in Great Britain have suggested that unusual weather conditions might be the source, but the Met Office today dismissed the claims. Others on Twitter suggested that it could be traced back to controlled explosions or military exercises. Meanwhile, conspiracy theorists took to social media to claim that aliens were to blame. Claudia Angiletta said that she was watching TV at home when the unexplained sounds started. She told MailOnline: 'I was just at home watching TV when I couldn't hear the program due to the loud noises. It was very distracting as it went on for ages. People throughout the UK, including Edinburgh, reported hearing 'rumbling' sounds around 9pm and 10pm last night . 'I went out to look for fireworks but I couldn't see anything in the sky. That's when I recorded the clip to send to my family to see if they could hear the same thing.' The 27-year-old said that her family, who live roughly seven miles away in Norbury, south London, could also hear the sounds, which lasted for about 30 minutes. She then turned to Twitter to see if anyone could explain what they were. Many suspected sonic booms similar to ones which shook Kent last month when two RAF jets intercepted a Latvian cargo plane in British airspace. But a Ministry of Defence spokesman told MailOnline she had no records of any jets being scrambled last night. The denial only served to fuel an outpouring of Saturday night speculation on social media. Within minutes Twitter users had started spreading hashtags from the straightforward (#loudbangs) to the slightly melodramatic (#omgwereallgoingtodie). Many of the reports were picked up by Twitter user Virtual Astronomer, who said space debris re-entering the earth's atmosphere could have been responsible. 'Space debris such as old satellites and things can cause sonic booms heard over very large areas,' he told MailOnline. 'It's the same for big meteors or rocks that come in. 'There are also some rare meteorologic phenomena that can cause rumbling or bangs apart from thunder. 'The only other explanation could be supersonic aircraft. There was very little wind last night so conditions were perfect for sound to travel very long distances.' In response, science writer David Dickinson, said on Twitter that debris from Russian satellite Kosmos 2251 could be to blame, but admitted that the timings 'weren't a good fit'. Reaction: There was an explosion of activity on Twitter, where some users came up with their own theories . Others thought that the loud noises might be due to unusual weather events, such as space weather, electrical storms or ferocious thunder storms. But the Met Office said today that there had been no reports of such weather last night. A spokesman told MailOnline: 'It definitely wasn't meteorological'. Dozens of the reports focused around Croydon, south London, where baffled Twitter users were asking each other what had happened. #Spooked: Was it an alien invasion, a meteor, the Third World War - or simply a few stray fireworks? The Metropolitan Police said that a fireworks display in Croydon could have been the source. But that does not explain why other noises were heard in Bedfordshire, Glasgow, North Devon, Leicestershire and West Sussex. Dave Reed, who lives in Fareham, Hampshire, said his dogs 'went crazy for a couple of minutes' after hearing what he had assumed were fireworks. The noises prompted conspiracy theories and immediate claims of a 'media blackout'. Twitter user Carrie Proctor wrote: 'This is how we'll find our that WW3 has begun. It'll be a Twitter hashtag long before any official announcement!'","On Saturday afternoon residents in upstate New York reported hearing a loud boom that shook their homes and rattled windows .
State police received numerous calls about the loud boom, but have no idea what caused it .
More than 3,000 miles away in the UK people took to social media to also report hearing unusual noises around the same time .
One possible explanation is that the it could have been a meteorite breaking up in the atmosphere - which would result in a sonic boom .

"Theo Walcott has suffered another injury setback, ruling him out of Saturday's Premier League showdown against Manchester United. The Arsenal forward has only just come back from fitness following a nine month lay-off with a serious knee injury. But Walcott has now returned from England duty with a groin problem. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Theo Walcott, pictured ahead of England's game against Scotland,  has returned to Arsenal with a groin injury . Walcott, in training for England last week, has only just returned from a nine-month injury lay-off . Danny Welbeck, pictured celebrating Wayne Rooney's second goal against Scotland, is an injury doubt . 'Theo is not available for tomorrow's clash, he has a tight groin,' said Wenger. Walcott's team-mate Danny Welbeck is also a doubt for the game after picking up a hamstring injury whilst on international duty. Wenger added: 'We will decide of Welbeck is fit after checking on him today.' Fit-again striker Olivier Giroud can, however, help offer Arsenal 'different options', according to Wenger. The France international has recovered quicker than expected from a fractured leg suffered when challenging for the ball in the closing stages of the 2-2 draw against Everton on August 23. Olivier Giroud has returned to training for Arsenal and could feature against Manchester United . The Frenchman has been sidelined after he suffered a fractured leg in the draw at Everton back in August . Football analysts Bloomberg Sports believe an Arsenal win is the most likely outcome against Man Utd . Wenger revealed Giroud could even be involved in the game against United at the Emirates Stadium, although the trip to West Brom on November 29 looks a more realistic target. The Gunners boss is confident when he and Walcott are fully match fit, the Arsenal squad will have even more firepower at their disposal to add to the impressive form of summer signing Alexis Sanchez and former United frontman Welbeck. 'Giroud and Mikel Arteta are both available. It is just a question of how ready they are, but they are available,' said Wenger to the club's website. 'He (Giroud) is three or four weeks ahead of schedule. Originally we planned to have him back for competition at the beginning of next year, so he is one month ahead.' Wenger added: 'Yes (we relied on Welbeck), and on Sanchez as well, but we have Giroud back, we have Walcott back. Slowly they will integrate into the team again and give us different options.'","Walcott has returned to Arsenal from England duty with a groin problem .

"Among the many lines of FIFA-approved script piled upon Ballon d’Or jurors during the months leading up to voting, one simple sentence cuts to the heart of the decision-making process. Like a First Commandment for those blessed with the responsibility of putting three unbelievably talented footballers in the ‘right’ order, it describes the judging criteria as ‘performances for club and/or national team (particularly in important matches), fair play and general level of performance since November 30, 2013.’ No mention is made of trophies won, goals scored, assists provided, buy-out clauses activated or social medial followers acquired during the 12-month qualification period. Manuel Neuer came third but the German redefined goalkeeping during an extraordinary 2014 . Ronaldo was a deserving winner as he beat Lionel Messi and Neuer to the award in Zurich . FIFA President Sepp Blatter (right) congratulates Ronaldo on winning the award . John Greechan - Chief sports writer of the Scottish Daily Mail and Ballon d’Or jury member, representing the Scottish media, for the past ten years. Here's how his votes were cast: . 1) Cristiano Ronaldo . 2) Manuel Neuer . 3) Lionel Messi . If there has occasionally been something distasteful about the posturing and politicking since FIFA merged its annual awards with the traditional France Football honour back in 2010, it essentially remains an invitation to make a judgement call. With that in mind, Cristiano Ronaldo made the best case to be considered first among equals. Unlike last year, when many of us still felt that goals alone weren’t quite enough to edge out certain stellar rivals, his efforts in 2014 have been all about achieving excellence for himself and his team-mates. When Real Madrid have needed him in the biggest games and sternest tests, especially en route to La Decima, he has delivered. The 29-year-old played an integral role as Real Madrid won the Champions League last season . Ronaldo scored a staggering 56 goals in 51 appearances for Real as they won four trophies in 2014 . Ballon d'Or: Cristiano Ronaldo . Women's world player of the year: Nadine Kessler . Puskas award: James Rodriguez . World coach of the year for men's football: Joachim Low . World coach of the year for women's football: Ralf Kellermann . World XI: Neuer; Lahm, Ramos, David Luiz, Thiago Silva; Di Maria, Iniesta, Kroos; Messi, Ronaldo, Robben . FIFA presidential award: Hiroshi Kagawa . FIFA fair play award: FIFA volunteers . Not just through those trademark moments of individual brilliance, but by getting the best out of those around him; he is a mature talent at the peak of his powers. There are times when Ronaldo looks more than unstoppable. Moments when he looks as if he’s playing a different sport from the rest. That’s why he’s No 1. That doesn’t mean there wasn’t a case to be made against the Portuguese superstar - and for the German goalkeeper who got my second vote. If the Ballon d’Or was purely about being the best player at the World Cup, CR7 wouldn’t have been in the top three. Yes, he was playing for a makeweight nation. So, it could be argued, was James Rodriguez. As were all of the USA ‘stars’ who impressed in Brazil. While Neuer excelled for a Germany team who surpassed all expectations, though, one month of summer football - however brilliant - doesn’t a season make. Third-placed Manuel Neuer (left) signs autographs on the red carpet ahead of the Ballon d'Or Gala on Monday . Neuer (left) was a mainstay in the Bayern team that won the Bundesliga and DFB Pokal Cup last season . It was an agonisingly tight decision, though, with the Bayern Munich goalkeeper deserving universal recognition for redefining his position, helping to inject mobility and adventure into his club and national teams. Along with the small matter of winning the World Cup, he remains a huge part of the Bayern team who, despite last season’s scarring Champions League semi-final destruction by Ronaldo’s Real, remain untouchable domestically and hugely impressive on the European stage. As for the third pick? Well, Lionel Messi apparently endured a nightmare in 2014, ending the year without a trophy to his name. He still inspired Argentina to a World Cup final and stood out in a struggling Barca time. Not bad for a quiet year. But not enough to seriously contend with his great rival. The 28-year-old's brilliant year was completed by helping Germany to win the World Cup last summer . The trio were all included in the FIFPro World Team of the Year which is selected by their peers .

"In the second of a new weekly column, Chief Sports Writer Martin Samuel gives his verdict on the footballing issues of the week, saying what made him feel warm inside and what made him shiver... WHAT'S HOT . Black boots . Puma killed it. On May 14, 2014, the sportswear manufacturer unveiled their ‘Tricks’ boots. 'The right boot is pink, the left boot is blue,' they announced, breathlessly, confirming that Cesc Fabregas, Radamel Falcao, Mario Balotelli and Yaya Toure would be among those wearing them at the World Cup. So that went well. Actually, that’s not fair. They did have one of the leading members of the German squad signed up, too. Marco Reus. So that went really well. Mario Balotelli wears his colourful Puma boots during Liverpool's defeat by Real Madrid last week . On that day, coloured boots jumped the shark. The greatest footballers in the world are meant to look like athletes, not one candelabra short of Liberace. At which point, no doubt, the greatest of them all knew exactly how to be special again. 'Black,' said Cristiano Ronaldo. 'Next season, it’s back to black.' And so, at last weekend’s Clasico, he revealed his new look. Being Cristiano, there were of course, individual touches – a large CR7 embossed in white on the side – but Ronaldo has reverted to old school black footwear and so far it has been a winner. Ronaldo’s Real Madrid outplayed Barcelona and the next day Robin van Persie scored an injury time equaliser for Manchester United against Chelsea – also in retro black. Cristiano Ronaldo - wearing black boots - celebrates after scoring in last weekend's Clasico . Indeed, considering how intimidating Mike Tyson used to look in black boots and plain black shorts – what the hell was the rest of football thinking prancing around in pink? These lads liked a bit of black, too. Marouane Fellaini . Poor old David Moyes. Even his guy, the first major signing of his brief Manchester United reign, is now playing better under the new guy. In the last two matches, Louis van Gaal has brought more out of United’s £27million midfielder than Moyes did at any stage last year. Man of the match against Chelsea, Fellaini is shaping up as a dominant force in the heart of the play, just in time for the derby meeting with Manchester City on Sunday. Fellaini looked short of confidence under Moyes, shrinking in his red shirt when he should have been an imposing presence. Van Gaal is believed to have told Ed Woodward, the chief executive, that he did not see Fellaini as a United player and was ready to let him go to Napoli on loan. Then circumstances intervened. Injury thwarted Fellaini’s departure – and now he has taken his chance. A late equaliser against West Bromwich Albion restored his self-belief. Charged with keeping Chelsea’s Cesc Fabregas quiet last week he did just that, and then won the header to set up United’s equalising goal. His figures were superb: he ran 12.17km, one kilometre farther than any other player on the pitch, including 70 sprints – more than either of United’s overlapping full-backs. Nine games in, Van Gaal he is convinced that English football requires greater physical qualities – and Fellaini fits that bill. After Fabregas, he will be picking on someone his own size this weekend in Yaya Toure. Marouane Fellaini was outstanding for Manchester United against Chelsea last weekend . Madison Bumgarner . Crazy name, crazy guy. Well, not really. The crazy guys in Major League Baseball are the ones who can hit the ball out of the park. Bumgarner isn’t like that. He’s the one who stops the fun, a pitcher who ties the hitters in knots. And he’s the main reason the San Francisco Giants are World Series champions again. 'The difference,' said Sports Illustrated. Simple as that. Bumgarner was named Most Valuable Player after the Giants beat the Kansas City Royals 4-3 in a best of seven series. He came out of the bullpen to close out the last five innings for no score as the Giants won the deciding game 3-2. So why didn’t he start? Two days earlier, Bumgarner had thrown a 117-pitch shut out. No runs, and only four hits. He was being rested. That’s the difference between baseball and cricket. One guy can pitch every ball. And Bumgarner threw in 21 of San Francisco’s 61 innings. In the days when pitchers’ arms are protected like Qing dynasty porcelain, that is a stunning record. Of his 291 pitches, 205 were strikes. Baseball had become an increasingly discredited sport dominated by steroid-packed big hitters. Bumgarner has restored it to the old days: the pitcher as king. 'He’s a stud,' said Tim Hudson, without a trace of envy. Who’s Hudson? The pitcher he replaced. Madison Bumgarner throws a pitch during the World Series this week . Bumgarner celebrates with team-mate Buster Posey as the San Francisco Giant clinch the World Series . WHAT’S NOT . Lee Clark's agent . Good God, who is advising this guy? Has he got a death wish? Actually, I take that back. Maybe Clark is the headstrong type. Maybe he won’t listen to reason. Either way, he can certainly pick them. Clark would appear to have talent. He took Huddersfield Town on a record-breaking 43-game unbeaten run, only to be sacked three months after it ended having lost two games. He then spent two fulfilling years at potless Birmingham City, where he prevented them losing 8-0 at home to Bournemouth, which they promptly did the moment they sacked him. Now Clark has returned – at Blackpool. No, seriously he has. He’s jumped from the second worst team in the Championship, to the absolute worst. That’s right. Worse than the team that lost 8-0 at home to Bournemouth. Worse by five whole points. Blackpool are the team with the poorest point aggregate – six from 14 matches – in the top seven divisions of English football. At least there was an excuse for the mess at Birmingham: their owner went to prison. Blackpool’s Karl Oyston is very much at large. It comes to something when your football club might be better run from Parkhurst. It is only a pity that George Reynolds of Darlington is no longer around. Convictions for smuggling, safe-cracking, handling explosives, burglary, theft and tax evasion, and a club that ended up reforming as Darlington 1883 in Division One of the Northern League, after he had left them ruined. No doubt Clark would love to work with an owner like George. Lee Clark - sacked by Birmingham earlier this month - is Blackpool's new manager . The London Olympics . Very hot, the London Olympics. Very hot in 2012. In 2014, not so much. Nevertheless, the usual moans have accompanied news that builders Balfour Beatty will need an additional figure of around £50m from the public purse to convert the roof of the Olympic Stadium to the satisfaction of West Ham United. There is annoyance that, under the terms of the deal, the club does not bear the cost. The critics are outraged, insisting West Ham have the deal of the century, a brand new home given to them by the people of Britain. So let’s walk it through one more time. To begin with, this could all have been avoided if the gang of three overseeing the project – Lord Coe, Tessa Jowell and Ken Livingstone – had accepted a football tenant was the only profitable legacy, and had insisted on a design that could be seamlessly converted. They didn’t. So this is the story. There was an Olympics. We had to build a stadium. The Olympics are now over. There will not be another here any time soon. Nor will there be sufficient athletics events or pop concerts to support the venue. So either the Olympic Stadium finds a regular tenant, or it sits empty, running up enormous maintenance costs, like the Millennium Dome, until it crumbles into the Thames. Your call. This way, we pick up one last tab and then it starts working for us. The other way, you pay. For ever. Thank the gang of three for this Hobson’s choice. London's Olympic Stadium is being converted to host West Ham United football matches . Manchester City . We all know what constitutes a crisis for an elite club these days: three games without winning. What was a drama after the surrender of a 2-0 lead against CSKA Moscow, became a blip with the loss to West Ham and a full-blown crisis after defeat at home to Newcastle United. Lose to Manchester United and it is possible City will reach headline stage four: meltdown. That first result saw them staring at an early European exit, the second left them trailing Chelsea by four points – and it could have been worse – then Newcastle’s reserves dumped them from the Capital One Cup. The pressure is on Manuel Pellegrini, with speculation already surrounding his future if City fail to win a trophy of significance. Meanwhile, in retirement, Sir Alex Ferguson looks like a genius. He regularly kept his serial winners at United hungry with nothing more than a reign of terror. Pellegrini appears lumbered with dilettantes. They thought they had the Moscow game won, only woke up to West Ham’s threat when the second went in, and took Newcastle for mugs. There is only one set of mugs after that sequence of results. They need to win the next one, and not just to keep Jose’s big, front-running horses in sight.","Cristiano Ronaldo wore black boots in last weekend's Clasico .

"The parents of Michael Brown are set to speak at a United Nations human rights conference in Switzerland next week - three months after their son was shot dead by a police officer. Michael Brown Senior and Lesley McSpadden are scheduled to address the 53rd Session of the United Nations Committee Against Torture in Geneva on November 12 and 13. With the help of a Saint Louis University law professor, they have set up an online page, dubbed 'Ferguson To Geneva', on which they are collecting donations for their travel expenses. It comes nearly 14 weeks after the pair's 18-year-old unarmed son, who is black, was gunned down by white officer, Darren Wilson, in the St Louis suburb of Ferguson. Scroll down for video . Parents: Michael Brown Senior (left) and Lesley McSpadden (right) are scheduled to address the United Nations Committee Against Torture in Geneva next week regarding the death of their son, Michael Brown . The shooting on August 9 triggered a national debate on race relations and months of violent demonstrations, with many protesters claiming the teenager was shot because he was black. Police have said Brown, who was 6ft 4ins and 300lbs, was killed in a scuffle after Wilson told the teenager and his friend to move out of the street and onto a sidewalk. They claim the victim was trying to go for Wilson's gun; however, witnesses, including the friend, told the press that Brown had his hands up and was surrendering when he was gunned down. Brown Sr and McSpadden, who have campaigned since their son's Missouri death, will leave for Geneva on November 10, the family's attorney, Anthony Gray, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. High-profile shooting: It comes three months after 18-year-old Brown (pictured) was gunned down by white officer, Darren Wilson, in the St Louis suburb of Ferguson.

Fundraising: With the help of a Saint Louis University law professor, Brown's parents have set up an online page, 'Ferguson To Geneva' (pictured), on which they are collecting donations for their travel expenses . On the 'Ferguson To Geneva' page, a family spokesman wrote that Brown's relatives were prepared to take their case before a 'global community'. They said: 'In the absence of justice from the local, state, and federal government, the family of Michael Brown and Ferguson protesters are ready to take our case before the global community. 'We have submitted a brief to the United Nations (UN), and we will formally present it on November 12th and 13th in Geneva, Switzerland.

"Manchester United 3-0 Cambridge United - read Ian Ladyman's match report . Marouane Fellaini impresses - player ratings . Van Gaal: Winning FA Cup is the priority . Sometimes it isn’t easy to understand Louis van Gaal, and we’re not just talking about those occasions when he compares FA Cup ties to ‘death or the gladiolus’ or complains about back-fours ‘twitching my ass’. The temptation has been to not question a man with his wealth of football experience who has coached some of the best teams and best players in the world. After all, Louis knows best. But there have been times in his first seven months at Old Trafford when Van Gaal has left us scratching our heads; times when it all seems to be coming together, when formations are starting to make sense and players are building momentum, when he will appear to rip it up and start again. Louis van Gaal mixed up his tactics again as Manchester United hosted Cambridge United on Tuesday night . James Wilson netted the final goal of the evening as United advanced to the FA Cup fifth round with a 3-0 win . Adnan Januzaj was perhaps unlucky not to be selected on Tuesday after starting to show his promise . So it was that we arrived at Old Trafford on Tuesday night to find that United had made five changes for the FA Cup fourth round replay against Cambridge United that brought a predictable home win. Nothing strange in that, you might say. Van Gaal is desperate to win this competition and it probably made sense to freshen things up after Saturday’s win over Leicester City here, although it was surprising to see Adnan Januzaj left out altogether after the teenager had begun to show some of his old promise. One look at Van Gaal’s teamsheet immediately raised questions about how United would line up, however. With the exception of Juan Mata, it was as if the manager had picked all his tallest players to counter the aerial threat from their League Two opponents. No pun intended, but surely Manchester United should be bigger than that? While fine in theory, the 4-1-4-1 formation had Wayne Rooney operating on the right and Marouane Fellaini on the left. Then the big Belgian began to drift forward as the first half wore and ended up almost as a target man, knocking the ball down for Mata’s opening goal. It was as if United were trying to beat Cambridge at their own game. Marouane Fellaini played in a forward role and knocked the ball down for Juan Mata to finish . Wayne Rooney was unusually played out on the right and was tasked with crossing for Fellaini and co . It worked, and Van Gaal would be justified in saying that he picked a team to do a job. But BBC pundit Steve Claridge was not the only one to be a little perplexed. ‘What an odd, odd system from Van Gaal,’ he said. ‘What an odd way to put out a team with the players you’ve got. Fellaini on the left wing and Rooney on the right? Really? Does that fit? ‘Why is he even out there, Rooney? Sir Alex used to play him there, but only when they were up against the likes of Bayern Munich and Real Madrid. If I was a player playing for United I would be absolutely deflated. If I was Rooney playing out wide against Cambridge, I would wonder what on earth the manager was doing with me. What am I doing out here? It’s just crazy.’ Jamie Carragher saw it a little differently. ‘The positions of Fellaini and Rooney are interesting tonight, not the usual positions you'd expect to see them in,’ said the Sportsmail expert. ‘Rooney wide right in possession but then tucking in when defending, and Fellaini playing up front to the left of Van Persie where he played at times under David Moyes at Everton. ‘Moyes never did that at United with Fellaini as he maybe felt he’d be criticised even though at times I think he should of but, LVG doesn’t seem to worry about other opinions and does what he thinks is right – so he should considering his cv!’ David Moyes may have been tempted to use Fellaini from the left, but he might have felt he'd be criticised . Van Gaal won't care what pundits like Jamie Carragher and Steve Claridge think . Too true. Van Gaal won’t give a fig what the likes of Claridge and Carragher think. From the moment he walked into Old Trafford, the Dutchman has been determined to do things his way. Sometimes it makes sense, sometimes not. His devotion to a three-man defence, for instance, has been puzzling. The players are clearly uncomfortable with it and that invites pressure from opponents. Van Gaal has spoken about ‘coaching the players minds’ so they can adapt to different situations, but the English aren’t Dutch and Total Football is not something that can be learned overnight. The fans have voiced their opposition to a system that is so foreign to United’s 4-4-2 ethos, and Gary Neville is not alone in pointing out that it curbs the team’s attacking verve. Ander Herrera has been on the bench since netting a stunning goal for United against Yeovil Town . Then there is Van Gaal’s treatment of certain players. He is not one to care for reputations but the way he has handled Radamel Falcao has brought public criticism from the striker’s agent Jorge Mendes, long considered to be a friend of the club. Ander Herrera’s reward for breaking the deadlock at Yeovil in the third round with a cracking goal was to be left out of the starting line-up for the last five games. Januzaj is the latest to find out that a good performance is no guarantee of a place in the team. Ultimately, Van Gaal is experienced enough to know that he will be judged on results. If he delivers a Champions League place and, who knows, the FA Cup this season then no-one is going to quibble about how he did it. United beat Cambridge comfortably and will fancy their chances of doing the same to Preston North End in the fifth round. For now, it’s the gladiolus not death. Whatever that means. As Van Gaal's (pictured with Richard Money) side keeps winning, for now, it's the gladiolus not death .","Manchester United beat Cambridge United 3-0 at Old Trafford on Tuesday .

'I do support British military air strikes but limited to distinctive targets. No changes in such societies can be enforced, they have to come from within.' Her support for air strikes comes after Mr Haines’ daughter Bethany called for IS to be 'eradicated.' David Haines, 44, from Perth in Scotland, had been in Syria working for French aid agency ACTED when he was kidnapped. His daughter Bethany, 17, has backed the use of military force against the terror group that used her 'truly amazing' father's life to send a grisly warning to its enemies. She said: 'IS need to be eradicated. They can't continue this way. They can't be doing this to people and get away with it. 'No matter what nationality, if they are Western or not. Hundreds of Syrians have been killed by them. They need to be stopped. If airstrikes and ground force is what it takes, that's what it takes.' Her comments come as David Cameron held a War Cabinet yesterday on the Government's plan to target Islamist fighters in northern Iraq and received its backing. MPs will vote around 5pm this evening on a Commons motion authorising British involvement in US-led bombing raids. It means RAF fighter jets could be over Iraq within hours of the vote. In her exclusive interview with ITV News, Miss Haines also paid tribute to the selflessness of her father, and spoke of her desire to follow him into aid work. 'He wanted to help everyone,' she said. 'It didn't matter what race or religion. Anyone who needed help he was there. Tragically he's lost his life doing what he loved but he wouldn't have stopped. 'Even if he'd come back after this he would've gone out again and again and again. He loved helping people. He was such a bright character. Always making people laugh, telling jokes.

She described him as a 'brilliant man' 'He was a brilliant man. And he will remembered like that by everyone who knew him and probably by people who didn't know him. 'He will be remembered and not for the way he was shown in that video, but for the truly amazing work he did and the bright character he was.' The teenager says her father's fate hasn't put her off helping others. She said: 'I'm hoping to do some aid work after next year and do a bit of work with a charity. Hopefully it will spark a career doing that. He'd tell me of all the people he'd helped and I want to do that too.' Haines is pictured on his wedding day with his four-year-old daughter from his second marriage . David Haines speaking in Croatia in 2003. His body has not been returned to his family . Miss Haines confirms that her father's body has not been returned to them, saying: 'No, we've not had a body. I don't know if they are trying to prolong the pain or they don't feel they need to, but as a daughter of someone who has been killed, you want closure. 'As a family you want closure. They have tried to hurt us by taking away someone we loved but they have failed. Because everyone who knows David will have a part of him with us forever.

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon has warned that the air campaign against ISIS in Iraq was for a 'long haul' of 'two of three years' at least. Mr Cameron's official spokesman later admitted the action could take a 'very considerable time'. It came after the Iraqi government revealed that it had received 'credible' intelligence that ISIS militants are planning to launch attacks on subway systems in Paris and New York. The video of his death provoked outrage, with Prime Minister David Cameron calling Mr Haines a 'British hero', dedicating his life to promoting peace in places of violent conflict and oversaw projects to save civilians from land mines.

"I wouldn't have missed a drug test like Rio . How I headbutted Schmeichel and gave him a black eye . I don't regret the tackle on Haaland . He didn't even own the bloody thing - Keane on the Rock of Gibraltar dispute . I knew Ronaldo would rule the world . Roy Keane has revealed he launched an expletive-laden rant at Sir Alex Ferguson which ultimately led to his departure from Old Trafford. Keane spectacularly fell out with Fergie following the then captain's harsh words during an interview with MUTV - which earned the Irishman a £5,000 fine from the club. But worse was to come after a training-ground bust-up involving Keane, assistant boss Carlos Queiroz, goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar and Ferguson. Roy Keane had an explosive bust-up with Sir Alex Ferguson in the aftermath of an interview with MUTV . Keane reveals in his book, The Second Half, extracts of which have been published in the Express, that Queiroz accused him of showing a lack of loyalty to his team-mates after his MUTV interview in which he tore into a number of the then United stars. Ferguson stepped in to quell the row, saying: 'That’s enough. I’ve had enough of all this stuff.' Keane responded by saying: 'You as well gaffer. We need f****** more from you. We need a bit more, gaffer. We're slipping behind other teams.' When Van der Sar chipped in and suggested Keane could have used a 'different tone' the reply was robust. 'Edwin, why don’t you shut the f*** up? You’ve been at this club for two minutes and you’ve done more interviews than I’ve done in my 12 years. It was MUTV – I had to do it.' 'Once we were at Juventus – they were playing Chelsea. We were standing at the corner flag and Adrian (Chiles) was next to me. He goes: ""This is great isn’t it?"". I went: ""I used to play in these games Adrian"". I wasn’t being cocky. 'It’s about justification, what you stand for. When I was at United I was getting paid good money but I could go: ""Yeah, but I'm giving it back to you"". I didn’t feel that way with this TV work. It’s an easy gig. I don’t like easy gigs. When I heard: ""I liked your commentary last night"". I knew I was only talking bulls*** like the rest of them. Hopefully my bulls*** was a bit better. I wanted to do something that excited me. TV work didn’t excite me. 'I liked Adrian and Lee Dixon, though. What I really enjoyed was the company. I liked meeting people, old players like Liverpool’s Jan Molby. Some United fans saw us together and one of them said: “Why the f*** are you talking to him?”. I felt like saying: “I will speak to who I f***ing want to!""' Fergie spoke about the MUTV interview in his book - released last year - and Keane has answered back . Ferguson and Keane's row eventually led to the end of the Irishman's Manchester United career . Keane was United manager Ferguson's leader on the pitch during his glory-filled years at Old Trafford . Keane later met Ferguson to discuss why he had been left out of a reserves match, which had been pencilled in to help his recovery from a broken foot, but was shocked at how the meeting unfolded. Fergie said: 'Roy, I think we’ve come to the end,' and Keane agreed, then chief executive David Gill presented a written statement on the Irishman's departure. Keane said: 'They had it all ready. It was another little hand grenade they threw at me. Not an hour later, or two hours, or after the severance negotiations – it was already written. ‘I said to Ferguson, “Can I play for somebody else?” And he said, “Yeah you can, cos we’re tearing up your contract“. 'So I thought, “All right – I’ll get fixed up”. I knew there’d be clubs in for me when the news got out. 'I said, “Yeah- I think we have come to the end”. ‘I just thought, “F******’ p****” – and I stood up and went “Yeah. I’m off”. 'I wonder about the current United dressing room. When a manager like Sir Alex Ferguson is replaced the new man needs a helping hand. Does that mean every player should like him? No. 'But I look at the current players and they should be doing a lot better. Not liking a manager can never be an excuse for not going out and doing your best. 'Looking at what happened to David Moyes, I can only conclude that he didn’t have a strong dressing room. He had a weak dressing room.' Keeper Van der Sar and Keane had words when the Dutchman chipped in during the row with Ferguson . Sir Alex could only look on as his Manchester United side were ripped apart by Middlesbrough . Keane is now assistant manager at Aston Villa, working under former Scotland midfielder Paul Lambert . Carlos Queiroz, Fergie's assistant at the time, was involved in the row with Keane . Keane also revealed his exit cost him £1million – a bonus written into his contract if he played in 50 per cent of United’s matches that season. But he does regret apologising to Fergie and Queiroz after the bust-up. ‘Now I kind of wish I hadn’t. Afterwards I was thinking, “I’m not sure why I f****** apologised”. 'I just wanted to do the right thing. I was apologising for what had happened – that it had happened. ‘But I wasn’t apologising for my behaviour or stance. There is a difference – I had nothing to apologise for.’ In his own book, released last year, Ferguson said his former captain had 'overstepped the mark' and when questioned at the time, Keane said he would deal with the 'lies' on another occasion. I worked under two great managers and I put Brian Clough ahead of Alex Ferguson for a simple reason. What was the most important thing in my football career? Brian Clough signing me. That kick started everything. Different managers, both brilliant. I think Clough’s warmth was genuine. I think with Sir Alex Ferguson it was pure business – everything is business. If he was being nice I would think: ‘This is business, this’. Brian Clough (left), pictured at the 1992 League Cup final, is the boss Keane rates his No 1 . He was driven and ruthless. That lack of warmth was his strength. United was a much bigger club than Forest but his coldness made him successful. His message was the same. I was never once confused by one of his team talks or his tactics or his training. The message was always fresh. I must have heard him talk 500 times and I always thought: ‘Yeah, that was good’. I think that’s amazing. As a manager I would take Clough’s warmth and Ferguson’s ruthlessness and put them in the mix – but also add my own traits.

"John Coleman, who co-founded the Weather Channel, claims that the belief humans are causing climate change is not backed up by science . Climate change has been proven to be a lie, according to a leading meteorologist. John Coleman, who co-founded the Weather Channel, claims that the belief humans are causing climate change is not backed up by science. In an open letter attacking the UN, the 80-year-old from San Diego, said that what 'little evidence' there is for global warming points to  natural cycles in temperature. 'There is no climate crisis,' he wrote. 'The ocean is not rising significantly. The polar ice is increasing, not melting away. Polar bears are increasing in number. 'Heat waves have actually diminished, not increased. There is not an uptick in the number or strength of storms. 'I have studied this topic seriously for years. It has become a political and environment agenda item, but the science is not valid.' According to The Express, Mr Coleman based his research on the findings of the NIPCC, a non-governmental international body of scientists. Their role is to offer an second opinion of the evidence reviewed by the UN's International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). 'There is no significant man-made global warming at this time, there has been none in the past and there is no reason to fear any in the future,' added Mr Coleman. 'Efforts to prove the theory that carbon dioxide is a significant greenhouse gas and pollutant causing significant warming or weather effects have failed. 'There has been no warming over 18 years.' Scroll down for video . In a letter attacking the UN, the 80-year-old from San Diego, said that what 'little evidence' there is for global warming points to natural cycles in temperature. Pictured is John Coleman, Weather Channel founder . Dr Jason Box tweeted this provocative statement after a Swedish study found methane leaking beneath the Arctic . The planet is 'f**cked' after scientists found huge plumes of deadly methane escaping from the seafloor. This is according to Dr Jason Box who claims that methane will be the main driver of climate change if it escapes into the atmosphere. He said: 'If even a small fraction of Arctic sea floor carbon is released to the atmosphere, we're f'd' The scientist, based at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, tweeted the provocative statement after a Swedish study found methane leaking beneath the Arctic. Some of this methane – which is over 20 times more potent than CO2 at trapping heat - is now making it to the ocean's surface. The leaking gas from the seafloor may have its origins in collapsing clusters of methane trapped in frozen water due to high pressure and low temperature. Scientists at Stockholm University called the discovery 'somewhat of a surprise,' which, according to Dr Box, is an understatement. 'We're on a trajectory to an unmanageable heating scenario, and we need to get off it,' Dr Box told Brian Merchant at Motherboard . 'We're f**ked at a certain point, right? It just becomes unmanageable. The climate dragon is being poked, and eventually the dragon becomes pissed off enough to trash the place.' The IPCC has warned that no one will be untouched by climate change with storm surges, flooding and heatwaves among the key risks. The report said that violent conflicts, food shortages and serious infrastructure damage were also predicted to become more widespread over the coming years. It also claimed that the world is in 'an era of man-made climate change' and has already seen impacts of global warming on every continent and across the oceans. It highlighted that in recent decades, Earth has seen changes in water resources as a result of melting glaciers and differences in rainfall, and reductions in wheat and maize yields. In the wake of the report's publication there were renewed calls from scientists and campaigners for action to cut greenhouse gases and to help vulnerable people adapt to already-unavoidable impacts of climate change.

'We live in an era of man-made climate change,' said Vicente Barros, co-chair of the IPCC study on climate change impacts, vulnerabilities and adaptation, from the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina. At the time of the report, one of its contributors has accused the IPCC of being too 'alarmist' – and demanded his name be withdrawn. Professor Richard Tol, an economist at the University of Sussex, said the drafts had been changed to make the findings more 'apocalyptic'. He said colleagues 'drifted too far to the alarmist side' and were likening climate change to the 'Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse'. Projected temperature change from 2081-2100. For the first time, the report connects hotter global temperatures to hotter global tempers.

"Creed frontman Scott Stapp was placed on psych hold for 72 hours after he told cops he hears voices that say his son will be killed be ISIS, a police report states. The 41-year-old was allegedly drugged on the roadside in Florida when he imparted his fears to patrolling officers and said someone was trying to poison him. According to the document read by TMZ, he was then placed in a psychiatric facility for three days. The revelation comes a day after it emerged his wife of eight years, former Miss New York Jaclyn Nesheiwat, filed for divorce last month, claiming the former millionaire threatened to kill her and their two children - and that he has guns to do so. In fresh legal documents she also alleges that Stapp called their child's school warning of an ISIS attack on November 10. Scroll down for video . Dispute: Jaclyn Stapp claims her estranged husband, Creed frontman Scott Stapp, threatened to kill her and their children in a drug-fueled text rant. The With Arms Wide Open singer claims he is 'as sober as can be' 'I went two days without eating and I ended up in an emergency room': Creed frontman Scott Stapp revealed he was broke and homeless in a desperate, 16-minute Facebook video posted Wednesday . She said he was driven to believe biological weapons and Satan were coming to Florida. Stapp, who was once worth $10 million, recorded a desperate, 16-minute Facebook video last Friday insisting he is 'as sober as can be'. In the recording he revealed he is now broke, homeless, and living in a Holiday Inn. According to Mrs Stapp, the father-of-three sent a text message that read: 'Florida is not safe. Biological weapons on the way. U have to leave with kids and meet me in Atlanta.' Another said: 'I'm coming to get you Satan and children. No mercy. You know how this ends. God created you and now God is ending you.' Stapp denies allegations of drug abuse, insisting he's as 'sober as can be'. On Wednesday he took to Facebook lambasting the claims, revealed in the Miami Herald. He said 'all hell broke loose' after an audit of his record company and personal accounts found 'people have stolen money from me'. Admitted to followers that he is now homeless, he explained: 'Right now I'm living in a Holiday Inn by the grace of God, because there's been a couple weeks where I had to sleep in my truck. 'I had no money not even for gas or food. I went two days without eating because I had no money and I ended up in an emergency room.'

'During the course of that audit a lot of things were uncovered. A lot of money was stolen from me or royalties not paid,' he said. 'There's people who have taken advantage and stolen money from me, and they're trying to discredit me, slander me, and I've even been threatened that if I went public like I'm doing right now, that any impropriety I've done in the past, that these individuals can get their hands to humiliate and embarrass me and try to ruin my credibility.' He added: 'The IRS has frozen my bank accounts two or three times to leave me completely penniless. 'I don't even understand that, why all this is happening at the same time. When I called to find out why, they said, ""Oh we had an address mix-up, it was a clerical error, so we'll return your funds in nine to 10 months."" I don't understand how that's fair America.' The comment was an apparent response to his estranged wife Jaclyn Nesheiwat, who claimed he was using amphetamines, crystal meth, and steroids in her divorce paperwork.

"Wounded? Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader the so-called Islamic State, is said to be among those targeted . American war planes have reportedly launched a strike on a gathering of ISIS leaders, critically wounding their leader. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was hurt in the strikes today, according to local witnesses and government sources. Two witnesses confirmed that bombs had fallen on the town of al-Qaim, next to the Syrian border. Local government sources described how an aircraft had swooped over a meeting of senior ISIS figures and dropped its payload, killing more than a dozen people. Another witness said that eight people had died when a bomb struck a market. A local hospital was said to be overwhelmed with the volume of patients from the raid - including al-Baghdadi. Local ISIS officials were reportedly roaming the streets with loudspeakers ordering residents to donate blood to help the wounded. Striking Baghdadi would be the most significant blow yet in the campaign against ISIS, who have been defiant in the face of sustained air attacks from the U.S. Air Force and allies. A provincial leader from Anbar in western Iraq, as well as his deputy, are said to be among those killed instantly by the bombs. Al-Qaim and the neighbouring Syrian town of Albukamal are on a strategic supply route linking territory held by Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. The so-called Caliph, who declared himself leader of all the world's Muslims in a televised speech, was formerly a prisoner of the U.S. during their occupation of Iraq. The shady figure was eventually released, and rose through the ranks of the jihadist groups which eventually united to form ISIS, or the Islamic State. Iraqi security officials could not immediately comment on the reported raid. The U.S. military did not confirm or deny the strike. Scroll down for video . Attacks: Two strikes were reported, one at al-Qaim, near the Syria-Iraq border, and a second in the ISIS stronghold of Mosul . Separately, the coalition of air forces, which includes Great Britain's RAF and Canadian fighter planes, struck a convoy just outside Mosul, ISIS's stronghold city in northern Iraq. U.S. officials would not confirm or deny whether Baghdadi, . the group's overall leader, had been targeted, though one said that the coalition's airstrikes had not been targeting any particular meeting. IS-affiliated Twitter accounts rushed to deny the reports, with one tweeting: 'I can report to the Muslims that Amir Al-Momineen Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi Hafid hu'allah is alive and well.' Prisoner: al-Baghdadi, shown before his rise to power, was held as a prisoner by the U.S. during the occupation of Iraq . The hardline Sunni Islamic State's drive to form a caliphate . in the two countries has helped return sectarian violence in . Iraq to the dark days of 2006-2007, the peak of its civil war. It has also created a cross-border sanctuary for Arab . militants, as well as foreign fighters whose passports could . allow them to evade detection in Western airports. The U.S. strikes coincide with violence elsewhere in Iraq, after jihadist-style attacks hit the Iraqi capital of Baghdad. On Saturday night a car bomb killed eight people in . Baghdad's mostly Shi'ite Sadr City, police and hospital sources . said. The blasts bring to 28 the day's toll from bombs in the Iraqi . capital and the western city of Ramadi. Two bombs exploded in separate attacks in Baghdad's mainly . Shi'ite Amil district, said a police source. 'A driver parked . his car and went to a cigarette stall, then he disappeared. Then . his car blew up, killing passers-by,' the source said, . describing one of the two attacks in Amil. In the mostly Shi'ite al-Amin area of Baghdad, another car . bomb killed eight people, medical sources said. The attack by a suicide bomber on a checkpoint in Ramadi in . Anbar killed five soldiers. 'Before the explosion, the . checkpoint was targeted with several mortar rounds. Then the . suicide humvee bomber attacked it,' said a police official. There was no claim of responsibility for the bombings, but . they resembled operations carried out by Islamic militants. In the town of Baquba, 40 miles northeast of . Baghdad, a gunman killed a Shi'ite militiaman, and a car bomb . targeting a police officer killed his 10-year-old son, security . sources said. Air strikes: The reports say that U.S. warplanes dropped bombs on the town of al-Qaim in Iraq. Pictured is an earlier strike against ISIS in Kobani, on the Turkey-Syria border . Western and Iraqi officials say U.S.-led air strikes are not . enough to defeat the al Qaeda offshoot and Iraq must improve the . performance of its security forces to eliminate the threat from . the group, which wants to redraw the map of the Middle East. President Barack Obama has approved sending up to 1,500 more . troops to Iraq, roughly doubling the number of U.S. forces on . the ground, to advise and retrain Iraqis in their battle against . Islamic State. The Iraqi prime minister's media office said the additional . U.S. trainers were welcome but the move, five months after . Islamic State seized much of northern Iraq, was belated, state . television reported. Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi is the relatively discreet leader of the Islamic State extremist group. He used to play for his mosque's soccer team and has a PhD in Islamic history. But after spending four years in a US camp during the Iraq occupation, he emerged as one of the most brutal terrorists in the world. The government placed a $10 million bounty on his head in 2011 when intelligence identified his movements as critically dangerous. This warrant was publicized once more following the beheadings of US nationals James Foley and Steven Sotloff as well as Britons David Haines and Alan Henning. He maintained a low profile for months as ISIS, the group's original name, rose to global infamy and Al Qaeda denounced them as 'too extreme'. But he finally revealed himself to the public with a speech, filmed and posted on YouTube, in the first week of July this year. Born Awwad Ibrahim al-Badri al-Samarri in 1971 near Samarra, Iraq, he came from a Sufi family - a tolerant form of Islam. In the 1990s, he completed a PhD in Baghdad and played soccer with friends. But he fell out with mosque leaders and fled to Anbar province where he joined Sunni groups protesting the US occupation. American forces detained Baghdadi at Camp Bucca in 2005 shortly after the Iraq invasion. He was released when the camp closed in 2009. He was thought to be 'bad but not the worst' sources told The Daily Beast. But he then joined the Islamic States of Iraq and Syria, and rose up the ranks rapidly. After allegedly killing the leader, Abu Omar Baghdadi, he took hold of the terror group. The United States spent $25billion on the Iraqi military . during the U.S. occupation that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003 . and triggered an insurgency that included al Qaeda.

"Cristiano Ronaldo has stated his intent to be remembered as one of football's greatest-ever players in history after he was crowned with the 2014 Ballon d'Or award. The 29-year-old beat Manuel Neuer and perennial rival Lionel Messi to the gong after a stellar 12 months which saw him win the coveted prize for a second successive year. Ronaldo has now been voted world footballer of the year three times, one short of four-time winner Messi, and the Real Madrid star stressed his determination to win more awards in the years to come.

'I can see my mother, my family. I would like to thank all those who voted for me. My coach, my fellow player, the President of my club. 'I want to get better as the days go by.

'Of course it is something that is always with me, I want to become one of the greatest players of all time, and this requires a lot effort so I would like to thank you for all this evening. BOOM!'

"There is a narrative arc in every RomCom that sees the two protagonists enjoy an initial spark, fall-out over some unforeseen development, then get back together with a bang. It’s a little like that with Aston Villa and form right now. Their season showed blossoming signs with 10 points from four games, capped by Gabriel Agbonlahor’s winner at Anfield. But since then it has been the cold shoulder treatment; four successive defeats and no goals. Monday night’s match against Queens Park Rangers presents the opportunity for their relationship with points to be rekindled. And in front of the cameras, for added cinematic effect. Gabriel Agbonlahor celebrates after scoring against Liverpool in the final match of their impressive start . Agbonlahor netted a late winner to ensure Aston Villa gained 10 points from their first four matches . The coming encounter marks the end of a horrific run of fixtures that saw Villa play each of last season’s top five teams. Victory at Liverpool in the first of those, following wins over Stoke and Hull and a draw with Newcastle, added gloss to a solid campaign start. Successive defeats to Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City and Everton have though brought dawning realisation that this may yet turn into another difficult season. Villa were second favourites in each of those encounters so it is no surprise they failed to emerge with anything. Rather it is the manner of some performances which heightens the importance of the match at Loftus Road. Since their impressive start, Villa have struggled with four defeats in a row . In their four successive defeats, Villa have not scored a goal... Sergio Aguero is pictured netting against them . Diego Costa scored the second Chelsea goal in a 3-0 defeat over Aston Villa in September . It is 441 minutes since Agbonlahor poked in from close range to defeat Liverpool. Burnley territory. Never before have Villa gone five consecutive Premier League matches without scoring. Even during the good times this lack of creativity was a concern. Villa amassed their ten points through just four goals and six shots on target. Since then they have worked the opposition goalkeeper with shots another six occasions in total. It is a paucity that needs addressing. As we saw against Liverpool, QPR are a team who can do your work for you. Aiming for the feet of Richard Dunne and Steven Caulker with crosses is one tactic, sure. But Paul Lambert cannot rely on such generosity. Roy Keane (left) and Paul Lambert (right) now have the job of getting Villa's season back on track . Villa's form has been like a film script - they enjoyed the initial period, but have hit a snag in recent weeks . Villa must now reignite their season, beginning with their trip to QPR on Monday night . Christian Benteke started at Goodison Park but is clearly a way off reaching his physical peak. Villa badly missed the energy and forward momentum Fabian Delph provides from midfield. It may be a tactical tweak is required to generate greater attacking thrust. The diamond might do it, positioning both Benteke and Agbonlahor as strikers, twinning strength with pace, and having Tom Cleverley in behind. The midfielder was at his best for Manchester United operating in and around the box, playing one-twos to unlock defences, before recent seasons saw him further withdrawn. It would mean Ashley Westwood sitting, supported by wingers Kieran Richardson, adept at defending, and either Charles N’Zogbia or Jack Grealish, inclined to attack. Given N’Zogbia’s performances of late it may be time to hand the 19-year-old his first start. It would be a departure from Lambert’s trusted 4-3-3 formation and a defensive risk given the groin injury to Philippe Senderos – he provided excellent organisaion alongside Ron Vlaar for the first three games – but it might be equally dangerous to continue as it is. QPR, for all the subsequent flabgate fallout, showed enough against Liverpool to suggest Loftus Road under the floodlights can be the setting for a twist in the script.","Aston Villa started the season with 10 points from their first four matches .

"Jorge Mendes, as agents do, backs his client. Forget Manchester United, he tells us, Radamel Falcao can walk into any team. Not on recent evidence he can't. Both Radamel Falcao and Robin van Persie failed to impress in Manchester United's clash with Burnley . The Colombian forward (left) was eventually substituted for James Wilson, who was more effective . Against 19th-placed Burnley the Colombian combined with Robin van Persie in the most one-paced attack since the England cricket team last toured Down Under. For weeks United fans had bemoaned Louis van Gaal's decision to play untested youngster James Wilson ahead of the man they paid £6million for just to get on loan. Now we know that there was method in the apparent madness. Burnley's centre-half partnership of Jason Shackell and Michael Keane are not among the Premier League's finest or fastest. For long periods, however, they were untroubled by a strikeforce worth a reported £70m. Their team appeared to be wearing kits made of Bacofoil and throughout the first half Falcao did his best Tin Man impression with the ball cannoning off him on more than one occasion. Falcao has only scored four goals in 18 appearances for United since joining on loan . United captain Wayne Rooney offers a word of advice to Falcao during the Burnley match . It was ugly to see. Yes, his flick back set up Chris Smalling to save United from half-time pelters from their own fans. But the man is here to score goals and he is not doing that. The record says it all: 13 starts, five substitute appearances and four goals. Perhaps it is still too early to judge. This is, remember, a man who has come back from serious injury before. But it would appear that the anterior cruciate ligament damage he sustained in January last year may have done more than keep him out of the World Cup. When Falcao was mercy substituted on 74 minutes against Burnley he received applause you would describe as polite rather than rapturous from the home support. Wilson impressed against an, admittedly tired, Burnley defence when he came on as a substitute . Falcao has been preferred up front to Rooney, who spent parts of the game playing as a holding midfielder . The contingent of travelling Lancastrians were not so kind, gleefully belting out 'What a waste of money'. On came Wilson who, along with Di Maria, immediately had an admittedly tiring defence back-pedalling. The youngster may not have Falcao's pedigree but as Van Gaal has already said, whether a player costs £95m or £5,000 it makes no difference to him. Mendes now appears to have gone nuclear, stating that Falcao would not be struggling if Sir Alex Ferguson had been in charge. That sounds very much like a comment from a man who has just asked United about the chances of them taking up that £43.5m option to make his deal a permanent one.","Radamel Falcao has scored four goals in 18 appearances this season .

"Donors who gave political parties £14million were later appointed to the House of Lords, a report revealed last night. That was the total sum handed over from 2001 to when the Peers were ennobled by the parties to whom they donated the money, anti-corruption campaigners found. In total, members of the upper house gave £39million over 13 years to the major political parties, Transparency International said. Peers gave £39million over 13 years to the major political parties, Transparency International has found . The group warmed that the new figures would reinforce the suspicion that peerages could be bought. Transparency International's executive director Robert Barrington warned that the system was 'highly vulnerable to corruption'. Former sleaze watchdog Sir Alistair Graham, who was chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life said the research showed House of Lords reform was a ‘top priority’ if we ‘want to safeguard the integrity of our democratic system’. The figures were reported by The Sunday Times, who said all the individuals and parties involved deny any link between donations and a seat in the Lords. The research, in the Sunday Times, showed that 11 Lords appointed in the last four years donated more than £100,000 each to either a political party or an individual MP between 2001 and receiving their peerage. Labour's Lord Haughey had given the party £1.3million by the time he was elevated to the Lords in September last year. He has since donated another £166,400. Lord Haughey told The Sunday Times he had donated over more than 10 years and ‘if there was any hint that my peerage was connected to my financial support, I would have point-blank refused to accept it’. Other donors named in the paper are Conservative peer Lord Fink, the hedge fund manager and former Tory Party treasurer, gave the party a total of £2.4 million between 2001 and 2011 when he was appointed to the Lords. He has since handed over a further £728,941. All three parties at the last election pledged to end the ‘big donor culture’ in politics. Lord Bew, who chairs the committee on standards in public life said: ‘Suspicion about the motives of political donors and recipients comes as no surprise when all three main political parties rely on a small number of big donors for the funds they need.’ Earlier this month, a former Liberal Democrat treasurer, Lord Razzall, said he was repeatedly offered cash for seats in the Lords – prompting a report to the Metropolitan Police and demands for a formal inquiry. Critcs demanded the Peer name those involved to the police. Sir Alistair Graham, the former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said the research showed  Lords reform was a ‘top priority’ if we ‘want to safeguard the integrity of our democratic system’ He admitted he received approaches from business people 'several times a year' but instead of reporting them he just told them to 'keep quiet'. The research showed that Labour peers collectively gave the party just under £21.6m since 2001, compared with the Conservatives' £15.6m and the £1.2m given to the Lib Dems. All lords who responded to requests for comments denied any link between donations and their peerages. Mr Barrington said: ‘We are not accusing any of these individuals of being corrupt. In many cases individuals have made substantial contributions to public life. 'But they are operating within a system that is highly vulnerable to corruption. 'These statistics will inevitably reinforce the perception that a peerage can be bought.'","In total, peers gave £39million over 13 years to the major political parties .

"The alleged Aussie mastermind of the Syrian jihadist network lives peacefully on welfare payments in suburbia with one of reportedly two wives in a quiet cul de sac in south-western Sydney. Hamdi Alqudsi, the 39-year-old who has been charged with recruiting seven Australians as terrorist fighters to Syria, is free on bail and living in a four bedroom brick home on a large suburban block at St Helens Park as he awaits a committal hearing. Three young Australians connected with Mr Alqudsi, a disability pensioner, have been sent to their death in Syria, including former Gold Coast private schoolgirl, Amira Karroum. Scroll down for video . Alleged Syrian recruiter: Hamdi Alqudsi (pictured on Tuesday outside a court in central Sydney) is charged with seven counts of recruiting the men to enter 'into a foreign state, namely Syria, with intent to engage in hostile activity in Syria, in particular, engaging in armed hostilities in Syria' Line up and shot: Beautiful Gold Coast private schoolgirl, Amira Karroum (pictured) secretly flew to Syria last December after her husband, Tyler Casey, was allegedly recruited by Hamdi Alqudsi. Ms Karroum and Casey were shot dead in mid-January in the northern Syrian town of Aleppo . Alleged mastermind: Hamdi Alqudsi (pictured on Tuesday after appearing briefly in the Downing Centre Local Court in central Sydney) is, police claim, the chief recruiter in Australia of young men who want to go and fight in Syria against government forces with groups such as the extremists in ISIS . Mr Alqudsi, who lives in his rented home on a large suburban block with his Australian Muslim convert wife Carnita Matthews, is briefly appeared at the Downing Centre Court on Tuesday and is due before a magistrate again this month. He is the first Australian to be charged under the foreign incursion laws since the establishment of the extemist ISIS group in Syria. He is charged with seven counts of recruiting the men to enter 'into a foreign state, namely Syria, with intent to engage in hostile activity in Syria, in particular, engaging in armed hostilities in Syria'. Another terror accused: Fatima Elomar (pictured on Tuesday outside a central Sydney court) has also been accused on planning hostile foreign incursions after she was arrested boarding an international flgiht, allegedly to go to Syria to join her husband. Ms Elomar's lawyer, Zali Burrows, plans to appeal to the High Court on her behalf . Death in Syria: Hamdi Alqudsi is accused of recruiting Tyler Casey (above, left), originally from Redcliffe, Queensland and former Australian infantry soldier, 22-year-old Caner Temel (right) to Syria where they were both killed in January, Temel shot in the head by a sniper, and Casey and his wife, Amira Karroum were reportedly lined up, shot, and their bodies dismembered . Soccer nut: Mehmet Biber, a 21-year-old Turkish-Australian from Merrylands, Sydney, who loved poetry and soccer, became radicalised and was then recruited allegedly by Hamdi Alqudsi and crossed the Turkish border into Syria, from where he has posted photographs of bloodied aid workers injured in fighting . But Mr Alqudsi, whose bail money was raised by Sydney Muslim groups, is preparing to apply to have the charges quashed by the High Court of Australia on the grounds they are unconstitutional. He is also suing Federal police for allegedly roughing him up during the recent Sydney terror raids, according to an ABC-TV report. As another Australian man charged under Australia's terrorism laws, Omarjan Azari, remains in maximum security on remand, Mr Alqudsi's alleged middleman in the Australian recruitment network, Mohamed Ali Baryalei is believed to have been killed in Syria. Police believe Baryalei left Australia to work in Turkey in conjunction with Alqudsi, the alleged main go-between for the Aussie recruits and the extremist group, Jabhat Al Nusra, which is linked to Al-Qaeda. Arrested boarding a plane: New Zealand-born Amin Mohamed (above), 23, from Lidcombe in Sydney's inner west, allegedly bought a mobile phone in a false name and made plans to travel to Syria via Turkey with Alqudsi's help. He was arrested while trying to board a plane in Brisbane last December and charged with preparing to engage in foreign hostile activities . Dawn raid: Hamdi Alqudsi was arrested last December at this four bedroom house (pictured) at St Helens Park in far south-western Sydney where he had been living quietly with his family. Police allege he was helping young Australians to go and fight in Syria . Thwarted attempt: Brisbane mother of four, Fatima Elomar (pictured outside the Downing Centre court in Sydney in July after facing charges of preparing to support a terrorist act in a Sydney court) was arrested trying to board an international flight . Police allege she intended to join her husband, Mohamed Elomar, who is fighting in Syria and would be arrested if he returned to Australia . Packed and ready: Lawyer Zali Burrows (pictured, centre) with accused terror client, Fatima Elomar, and her children covered in blankets leaving a Sydney court in July, says Hamdi Alqudsi is innocent and will apply to have his charges under the foreign incursion act thrown out as 'unconstitutional'. Ms Burrows is make a similar application to the High Court of Australia on behalf of Ms Elomar . In Syria: The husband of Fatima Elomar, Mohamed, has become one of the faces of Australians fighting in Syria since he left Australia for the war torn country and posted photographs of himself online holding up (right) the severed heads of tow men, purportedly Syrian government soldiers . Police will allege Alqudsi accessed funds for fares and expenses for the recruits, all of whom were in their 20s or early 30s. Allegedly, Mr Alqudsi would instruct the men to fly to Turkey and cross the border into Syria, where they would meet up with pre-arranged contacts. Police allege Tyler Casey was recruited between June and August last year. Casey is believed to have flown with his beautiful 22-year-old graphic arts graduate wife, Amira Karroum, to Syria before Christmas. Dangerous company: Renamed Yusf Ali and preaching (above) on Sydney streets, Tyler Casey was recruited, police allege, by Sydney suburban father and disability pensioner, Hamdi Alqudsi, and sent to Syria where he was shot and killed in the northern city of Aleppo within weeks of arriving . Road to death: Tyler Casey, who took the Jihadi name Yusuf Ali, joined the Street Dawah project where he met recruitment middleman Mohamed Ali Baryalei and took Islam to Sydney streets (pictured, left) before flying to Syria with his wife, Amira Karroum, and dying in a rebel incursion. Casey is pictured (right) with his mother, Kristine Hunt . The pair was killed in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo in mid-January, Reports say Ms Karroum was lined up against a wall and shot, and her body dismembered. Police claim Mr Alqusdi recruited former Australian infantry soldier Canal Temel in the same period. Mr Temel, 22, from the Sydney suburb of Auburn, was shot in the head during a siege in January. Mr Alqusdi's next alleged recruit was Turkish-Australian Mehmet Biber - jihadi name is Abu Malik - of the western Sydney suburb of Merrylands. Dead or alive? Mohamed Baryalei, a former Sydney bouncer and actor now believed to have died in Syria, is pictured (above) in Sydney in 2012, when he was a street preacher for his brand of Islam . The 21-year-old onetime poet and soccer nut is believed to still be fighting in Syria and has posted on Facebook graphic photographs of aid workers injured in rebel battles. Another would-be soldier for the ISIS forces in Syria, Amin Mohamed, 23, from Lidcombe in Sydney's inner west, allegedly bought a mobile phone in a false name and made plans to travel to Syria via Turkey. He was arrested while trying to board a plane in Brisbane last December and charged with preparing to engage in foreign hostile activities. Authorities believe three other alleged recruits - Mahmoud Aboshi, aka Abu Alem, of Melbourne, Muhammed Abdul-Karim Musleh, aka Abu Hassa, and Nassim Elbahsa - are fighting in Syria. Mr Alqudsi was arrested at his St Helens Park home last December. Alqudsi was remanded in custody and his passport confiscated. After he claimed he only had $500 and would struggle to make the $10,000 surety imposed by a magistrate, Sydney groups Hizb ut-Tahrir and Al Risalah held an emergency protest meeting. Supporters, including those from Sydney's Muslim community, raised the funds for his bail, and he was released a day later, on strict conditions. Mr Alqudsi has claimed to live a quiet, 'modest' life with his family. Neverthless, three years ago he was part of a noisy protest outside a Sydney court where his wife was appearing. Carnita Matthews was initially found guilty of falsely accusing a traffic policemen with trying to rip off her burqa when she was pulled over for a random breath test and declined to remove her facial covering for identification. She successfully appealed the conviction, which was overturned. Mr Alqudsi, who is also known as Ibrahim Gabriel and was named in 2011 as a devotee of controversial cleric Sheik Feiz Mohammed, chanted with other men outside the Sydney District Court, calling themselves part of the ‘Islamic Brotherhood Worldwide’. The following year, Mr Alqudsi, who called himself ‘Hamdi, Father of Ibrahim’, was reportedly among participants at Sydney's 2012 Muslim protest which led to riots in Hyde Park. Court outrage: Hamdi Alqudsi (pictured, centre) among other Muslim men protesting in 2011outside the court hearing after his wife, Carnita Matthews, was accused of falsely claiming a traffic policeman ripped off her burqa during a breath test. Ms Matthews successfully appealed the charge, which was overturned . Mr Alqudsi's lawyer, Sydney solicitor Zali Burrows told Daily Mail Australia she was preparing to mount a High Court challenge on his behalf against the foreign incursion laws. Ms Burrows is also challenging the laws for her another client, the wife of Syrian-based Australian ISIS fighter, Mohamed Elomar. Elomar posted photos of himself from Syria early this year holding the severed heads of Syrian soldiers. Fatima Elomar, is facing foreign incursion charges under the Crimes Act, which deems it illegal to travel to a foreign state, or help someone to travel, with the intention of engaging in hostile activity. The offence carries a maximum ten years imprisonment. Ms Burrows said Ms Elomar and Mr Alqudsi would both strenuously defend their innocence.

"Roger Federer has admitted that he would have found it difficult to continue playing tennis if he had been relegated from the show courts at major events. A very difficult 2013 had seen the 33-year-old written off by many, but a resurgence last season saw him end the year as world No 2, and he is now heading into 2015 as a real threat to add to his haul of 17 Grand Slam titles.

"Shackled: Performer in the show recreating a human zoo . Black actors starring in a live art show featuring slaves in chains and cages hit back last night at protesters who have forced the production to be cancelled. Exhibit B, which aims to recreate human zoos in which slaves were once displayed as museum objects, had been due to open on Wednesday night, but around 200 people blocked the entrances to the exhibition and disrupted traffic. Artist Brett Bailey had recruited a number of people of African and Afro-Caribbean origin and arranged them as living sculptures to offer a painful reminder of the appalling history of 19th century colonialism and racial hatred. A spokesman for the Barbican in London said it became impossible to continue the exhibit because of the ‘extreme nature of the protest and the serious threat to the safety of performers, audiences and staff’. But the black performers have defended the exhibition and rejected accusations of ‘complicit racism’. Actress Elexi Walker, who appears wearing a shackle around her neck, said: ‘It’s ridiculous to think I am being racist because I am involved in a piece that highlights the history of black people. The people who say that clearly have not had an informed opinion. ‘If the show had been allowed to happen people would have come into a space that was really reverent, a place where it was almost like a church in how quiet and careful it made you feel. The protesters have denied that to people of London.’ Priscilla Adade-Helledy has been called an ‘ignorant black woman’ for taking part. She said: ‘I feel abused as a person and I feel insecure. I was part of a project that is absolutely stunning... and now I’m scared for my own safety. I don’t know how it can be seen as racist. If they had seen the exhibition they would understand it.’ Reverent: Elexi Walker (left) and Priscilla Adade-Helledy, actresses who participated in the show . Police were called to attend the demonstration on Wednesday night. The Barbican spokesman added: ‘Given that protests are scheduled for future performances of Exhibit B we have had no choice but to cancel all performances of the piece. ‘We find it profoundly troubling that such methods have been used to silence artists and performers and that audiences have been denied the opportunity to see this important work. Exhibit B raises, in a serious and responsible manner, issues about racism. ‘It has previously been shown in 12 cities, involved 150 performers and been seen by around 25,000 people with the responses from participants, audiences and critics alike being overwhelmingly positive.’ Exhibit B was staged at the Edinburgh Festival over the summer. A petition, initiated by Sara Myers from Birmingham, opposing the exhibition had reached nearly 23,000 signatures yesterday. Mr Bailey said: ‘Do any of us really want to live in a society in which expression is suppressed, banned, silenced? My work has been shut down today, whose will be closed down tomorrow?’","Exhibit B, was to recreate human zoos in which slaves were once displayed .

"One Saturday evening a few years ago, a football manager confided his thoughts on Roy Keane to a small group of journalists. He deplored his behaviour, his disciplinary record and his general air of brooding malevolence. Somebody made the tentative suggestion that Keane might have one or two good points. The manager thought for a moment. ‘Maybe,’ he said. ‘But he keeps them bloody well hidden.’ At the time, it was an image which Keane did little to dispel. For him, it appeared, football was a violent game in a violent world. You played, you fought, you prevailed. And if you could inflict a little damage along the way, then so much the better.

It was a joyless philosophy, but Keane seemed a joyless individual; truculent, combative, a man who could pick a fight in an empty room. The fact that he was a wonderful player, one of the finest of his generation, only enhanced his aura. Some suspected the aggressive persona was something of an artifice; the cropped head, the jutting jaw, the intimidating stare. There was more than a whiff of calculation about the way he carried himself, but so daunting was the effect that few were prepared to question his credentials. If it really was an act, then Roy Keane was a hell of an actor. In truth, the question has not been settled by his latest autobiography, The Second Half. Keane is at pains to reassure us that he really was the monster of myth and legend. His violent clashes are regurgitated in lingering detail. The notorious assault on Alf-Inge Haaland is not only exhumed but opens the book: ‘I wanted to hurt him and stand over him and go, “Take that, you c***”. I don’t regret that.’ He describes a fight with Peter Schmeichel in a Hong Kong hotel: ‘Peter had grabbed me, I’d head-butted him.’ He relates in detail an altercation with Manchester United’s assistant manager Carlos Queiroz: ‘I’m surprised I didn’t knock him out.’ Keane's notorious assault on Alf-Inge Haaland (ground) in 2001 opens the book. ‘I wanted to hurt him,' he says . Keane, through writer Roddy Doyle, recalls a fight in which he heatbutted team-mate Peter Schmeichel (left) For those who subscribe to the popular perception of Roy Keane, the first half of this book will reinforce every prejudice. But then he becomes a manager. Everything changes, and his book captures those changes quite brilliantly. We become aware that Keane possesses a rare capacity for self-analysis. On the face of it, he is the epitome of gruff indifference: ‘This is me. If you don’t like me, tough!’ In fact, he worries about his tendency to self-destruct, he articulates the difference between anger and rage, and he reveals an insecurity we scarcely expected in so assertive a character. And he gathers together all the strands of this infinitely complex personality, and goes off to manage Sunderland. His confidences are occasionally beguiling: ‘I’d never had an office before. Now I had a secretary. I had a phone; a phone with buttons and different lines. I had a leather chair that swung around, a swivel chair. For the first few days I used to swing around on it. If any of the players or staff had peeped through the office window they would have seen me going, “Wheeeh!”’ He didn’t put up pictures of his family, since he didn’t want to make the place too comfortable: ‘I thought: “If things go badly, I want to be able to clear it out pretty quickly.” One box.’ Keane holds a copy of The Second Half in which he reveals another side to his personality . In passing, he supplies a delightful deflation of the risible Robbie Savage. Keane has the vague thought that Savage might give Sunderland a lift. ‘So I got Robbie’s number and rang him up. It went to his voicemail: “Hi, it’s Robbie — whazzup!” — like the Budweiser ad. I never called him back. I thought: “I can’t be f****** signing that”.’ He picks up on the small things, like the pre-match choice of music. ‘The last song that was played before the players went out on to the pitch was Dancing Queen by Abba. What really worried me was that none of the players, nobody, said: “Get that s*** off”… We lost 3-1. I don’t think it was down to Dancing Queen, but after the match I criticised the players… They were going out to play a match, men versus men; testosterone levels were high. You’ve got to hit people at pace. F****** Dancing Queen. I wouldn’t have minded if it had been one of Abba’s faster ones.’ Slowly, certainly, he grows to love the club. He becomes utterly engaged in the complexities of the job; not merely the tactics and performances, but the human relationships, the anticipation of crises, the way the staff would come to him with marital difficulties or problems with their children. Keane applauds on the bench in Dublin in his capacity as Republic of Ireland assistant manager . Keane (centre) gives a wry smile ahead Ireland's 7-0 defeat of Gibraltar in Euro 2016 qualifying . ‘I think that was one of my strengths,’ he says. ‘I think I had a kindness to me. But there was never a day when I’d go into work and come out in the same mood; there’d always be something going on.’ He starts to enjoy it, the setbacks and the successes. He takes Sunderland from the foot of the Championship to the title in his first season. He preserves their Premier League place in his second. He revels in the victories and tells a harrowing tale of his reaction to a 7-1 beating at Everton: ‘I hardly left the bed for 48 hours. I don’t think I even showered for two or three days. I was punishing myself.’ In the third year of a three-year contract, after some hard words with the new owner, he takes his leave. Just like that. Some six months later, he joined Ipswich. It was the wrong club at the wrong time. Again, he is fiercely honest: ‘I don’t think I’m a bad manager, but at Ipswich I managed badly.’ Keane enjoys his step into management at Sunderland, the setbacks and the successes . Even as a boss though his fiery, passionate side came out - here he argues with referee Rob Styles after his player Paul McShane is sent off in 2007 . After success at Sunderland, Keane gives an honest appraisal of his next job at Ipswich: 'I managed badly' We sense that he almost welcomed the parting. But it was to Sunderland that he gave the best of himself, where he discovered what the job entails, and he tells his story with startling clarity and almost painful candour. It is light years beyond the usual pap of managerial memoirs: ‘Toe-to-toe with Jose… Wild nights with Fergie… My Dream Team to play Mars.’ Keane’s book, ghost-written by Roddy Doyle, is an endlessly absorbing piece of work. It may well be the finest, most incisive deconstruction of football management that the game has ever produced. In short, it is something of a masterpiece. Roy Keane’s good points are hidden no longer. PS . The people who conduct post-match interviews for Sky Sports are rarely mistaken for Jeremy Paxman. But last weekend’s cross-examination of Alex Song and Stewart Downing, following West Ham’s victory over QPR, touched brave new levels of obsequiousness. ‘Guys,’ began the interrogator, ‘after that brilliant win against Liverpool, was that a decent way to back it up?’ As the great Eric Morecambe used to say: ‘There’s no answer to that.’","Roy Keane did little to dispel his perceived malevolent persona .
In the first half of his book, The Second Half, he reinforces every prejudice .
But then the former Manchester United hard man becomes a manager at Sunderland ... and everything changes .

"The Rev. Al Sharpton is expected to hold a four-day tribute for the death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson at the end of this month. Sharpton will be in the Missouri town from October 31 to November 4 in reference to the four hours that the teenager's body was left lying on the street. Sharpton is leading a wave of outcry after a Friday report suggested that investigators do not have enough evidence to charge a police officer over the shooting of Michael Brown. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Anger: Rev Al Sharpton launched an enraged attack on Darren Wilson for claiming he acted in self-defense . Campaign: Sharpton will be in the Missouri town from October 31 to November 4 in reference to the four hours that Michael Brown's body was left lying on the street . Details revealed by the New York Times included the first account of the shooting to come from Darren Wilson - who says he struggled with Brown in his squad car and shot the teen when he grabbed for his gun. Experts told the paper that they believe investigators do not have the evidence to prosecute Wilson on federal civil rights charges - meaning a grand jury could soon decide Wilson should not be tried over the killing. In his own version of events, the police officer told a grand jury he opened fire because the teenager was attacking him and he feared for his life. Wilson insists Brown viciously launched through the window of his police car, punching and scratching him repeatedly. Police officers are generally given more scope for lethal force if they reasonably believe that their life is in imminent danger. Eventually, Wilson said, he pulled his gun from the holster on his right hip, fired two shots, and one hit Brown's arm - leaving his blood smeared inside the car and on his uniform. The account stops there and fails to explain why Brown was shot a further four times outside the vehicle. Since no other witness had a clear vantage point from which to see the incident, legal experts warn Wilson's testimony will carry significant weight for the grand jury, a legal expert told MailOnline. Slamming the account as illogical, Sharpton said at his National Action Network rally in Harlem that it is the 'same excuse' as all other shootings of black citizens by white men. 'It sounds like a Michael Dunn defense,' he said, referring to the Florida man who has been convicted of first-degree murder for shooting dead black teenager Jordan Davis. Dunn claimed he did it because Davis was playing music too loudly. 'It didn't work in Florida and it shouldn't work in Missouri,' Sharpton added. He spluttered: 'First of all, if you stopped him - Michael Brown and his friend - walking down the street, what led to the scuffle? Sharpton is leading a wave of outcry after a Friday report suggested that investigators do not have enough evidence to charge a the shooting of Michael Brown . Aftermath: This is the first picture of Darren Wilson standing over Michael Brown after shooting him dead . Claims: Wilson, pictured again surveying the body, insists he fired from inside the car during a tussle but his account did not explain why the unarmed teenager was then shot at least four times outside the vehicle . 'Secondly, how does he and you get in your car? You trying to do what by yourself?' Sharpton asked. 'Now, if I go with you with your story all the way to that - that Michael Brown was shot, gets up off you in the car - why are you trying to tell me that a man ran back at you when he knew you had the gun and you already shot him?' He added: 'We were involved in Trayvon Martin. We were supportive of Jordan Davis. 'The strange thing is that all of them used the same excuse...The only gun there was Darren Wilson's! Strange parallels with all of these cases.' His words were echoed by Mahatma Gandhi's grandson Dr Arun Gandhi who said Wednesday 'We have looked at it only as racism, and racism is a byproduct of prejudice,' St Louis Public Radio reported. 'Prejudice exists in every one of us, whether we are black, white, brown, yellow.' Nonetheless, a jury will now have the power to tell the state attorney that Wilson is innocent of civil rights abuses if they believe his claim that he was acting in self-defense. Peter Joy, a professor at the Washington University of Law in St Louis, told MailOnline the charge of civil rights abuse is a much higher standard than murder or manslaughter, as the 12 jury members will have to be certain Wilson intended to violate Brown's civil rights by shooting him dead. 'The civil rights abuses are even harder to prove than an underlying criminal conviction. The federal government does not step in to pursue a civil rights conviction unless they believe it was an intentional abuse. 'There are some criminal charges that don't involve that kind of mental state, like murder. 'For example anger. They can be guilty of acting knowingly and recklessly, but it is different to intentionally violating a civil right.' As a result, he said, they will need forensic evidence of damage to the car to disprove Wilson's account if they are to find him guilty. Duke University law professor James Coleman Jr told MailOnline an innocent verdict would 'totally undermine the St Louis criminal justice system'. 'If a grand jury accepts that every shot he fired at that kid was in self-defense that simply is not plausible,' he said. But he warned that prosecutor Robert McCulloch - who has been criticized for his strong ties with the police - will have a strong influence over their verdict. 'Pretty much every jury does what they are told. 'If the prosecutor is being wishy washy about this, it is very possible a grand jury won't indict him.' Determined to level charges against Wilson regardless of the jury's verdict, Benjamin L Crump, the Brown family's lawyer, rebuffed the leaked account. 'What the police say is not to be taken as gospel,' Mr. Crump told the New York Times. 'He can say what he wants to say in front of a jury. They can listen to all the evidence and the people can have it transparent so they know that the system works for everybody. 'The officer's going to say whatever he's going to say to justify killing an unarmed kid. 'Right now, they have this secret proceeding where nobody knows what's happening and nobody knows what's going on. 'No matter what happened in the car, Michael Brown ran away from him.' A number of witnesses agree that Brown and Wilson were embroiled in a physical fight through the car window, but few had an accurate vantage point to see what was happening. 'Self defense': Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson says he feared for his life as he shot Michael Brown . They insist, however, the teenager was trying to flee and holding up his hands. One passer-by, Tiffany Mitchell, is certain Brown was leaning away but Wilson kept pulling him closer. Another, Dorian Johnson, said Wilson grasped Brown's throat and then pulled out his gun threatening to shoot. They then heard shots fired from inside the SUV. There remains no account from witnesses or police of the final four shots fired. According to Wilson's description of the August 9 shooting - revealed for the first time today - Brown made him fear for his life. Investigators are now examining the officer's claim that the teenager physically assaulted him as a grand jury considers whether he is guilty of a number of crimes including: first-degree murder, second-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter or involuntary manslaughter. City officials claim there is still not enough evidence to charge Wilson with violating civil rights. In September, Officer Wilson appeared  before a St Louis County grand jury, which was convened to determine whether there is probable cause that he committed a crime. His willingness to testify surprised many. However, his account of feeling vulnerable will be a significant boost in his favor as the grand jury considers its verdict before the deadline of January 7. Nine of the 12 jury members will have to vote against Wilson in order for charges to be leveled. They are expected to vote by mid-November. St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert P. McCulloch could have bypassed the grand jury stage and simply taken the case to trial by filing a charge against Wilson. He could also have filed a complaint to a judge who decides if there should be a trial. However, McCulloch chose to take the full investigation of Wilson's use of deadly force to the grand jury, leaving the 12 members to decide. According to the New York Times, the leaked account of his version of events did not come from the Ferguson Police Department or from officials whose activities are being investigated as part of the civil rights inquiry. People claiming to have witnessed the shooting have given wildly different accounts of what happened. Some have said that some the young man had his arms raised over his head while others claim that Wilson shot him while his back was turned and he was running. The police have maintained that the unarmed teen physically assaulted the officer and tried to get his gun. One witness, whose name has been withheld, from St. Louis, Missouri, told the grand jury that the teenager did not have his hands above his head when Wilson shot at him, but rather 'out to his sides.' He also said Brown 'staggered toward Wilson despite commands to stop' and that 'the two were about 20 to 25 feet apart when the last shots were fired.' Protests in Missouri have continued ever since the shooting amid claims it was unjustified - and an extreme example of police brutality in the town. Civil rights groups say Brown's death is part of a national epidemic in which a disproportionately high number of unarmed black men are fatally shot by white police officers, an allegation police deny. Officials said that the evidence given so far did not support civil rights charges against Officer Wilson. To press charges, the Justice Department would have to prove that he wilfully violated Brown's rights when he shot him.","The Rev.

"Hundreds of people lined the entrance to a Washington state high school as it reopened on Monday, more than a week after a student fatally shot three of his classmates, wounded two others and then killed himself. Waving well-wishers, many holding candles, greeted students returning to Marysville-Pilchuck High School following the October 24 shooting. People cheered as buses and cars entered the school campus. A 10.30am assembly started the school day, and lunch was in the gym because the cafeteria where the shooting took place remains closed. The normal class schedule, with its earlier start, resumes on Tuesday. People dressed in the school colors of red and white cheer and wave as one of the first school buses carrying students on their return to Marysville-Pilchuck High School drives past on Monday . Connie Dewdney, left, Raquel Dufour and Cherlyn Ferguson hold their hands in the shape of hearts as a school bus to Marysville-Pilchuck High School drives past  in Marysville, Washington . Washington Governor Jay Inslee asked residents to wear red and white — the school colors. The colors stand out vividly in a memorial with flowers, balloons and messages of love that covers the fence around the school. The shooter, Jaylen Fryberg, 15, a popular freshman who had recently been named a homecoming prince, died of a self-inflicted wound after opening fire. Zoe Galasso, 14, was killed during the shooting; Gia Soriano, 14, died on October 26; and Shaylee Chuckulnaskit, 14, died on Friday. Two other students remain hospitalized at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. Andrew Fryberg, 15, was in critical condition and Nate Hatch, 14, was in satisfactory condition. Both are Jaylen Fryberg's cousins. The teenage gunman opened fire on a group of his best friends and family members involved in a tragic love triangle. Jaylen Fryberg, 15, opened fire on the group in the canteen at Marysville-Pilchuck High School during a lunch break on October 24. Shaylee Chuckulnaski passed away on Friday at the Providence Medical Center as a result of 'severe injuries'. Her friend Gia Soriano, 14, and the girl the schoolboy gunman had a crush on, Zoe Galasso, 14, were also killed in the tragic shooting.

Shaylee's family said in a statement: 'Our hearts are broken at the passing of our beautiful daughter. Shay means everything to us.' It has been claimed Jaylen had a crush on Zoe Galasso and became heartbroken when she dated his cousin, Andrew. Ms Galasso was sitting around a table with her friends at Marysville-Pilchuck High School on Friday when Jaylen Fryberg opened fire. She was pictured attending the homecoming dance at the Washington school with Andrew Fryberg after she and Jaylen Fryberg fell out, just days before the deadly attack. Jaylen had previously treated Andrew like a brother, and was devastated to learn the girl who rejected him and chosen his cousin instead. In an ominous indication of the anger that spurred his deadly tirade, Jaylen tweeted last month: 'Dude. She tells me everything. And now I f***ing HATE you! Your no longer my 'Brother'!' The teenage girls are believed to be friends of Jaylen Fryberg, with witnesses suggesting he targeted them in a room full of hundreds of students.

"Police on Tuesday brought in an armored siege vehicle as the hunt for alleged cop killer Eric Frein moved into its 11th day. 'The Rook,' described by its manufacturers as 'six tons of pure responsive force' will allow officers to shield themselves as they hunt for Frein in dense woodland in northeast Pennsylvania. The tracked vehicle was brought to a police staging post just south of the village of Canadensis where police are focusing their search. Scroll down for video . Awesome: The Rook, above, was seen being delivered today to authorities on the 11th day of the hunt for Frein . Shield: This promotional image shows how men can be deployed at height using the extendable armored arm . Lethal: Frein, 31, has been described as a survivalist with an intense hatred of law enforcement . Weight: 13,000 lb. Cost: From $245,000 to $445,000 depending on extras . Engine: 84 Horsepower . Selling Point: Armored Deployment Platform can lift police to second floor window . Standard Package: Armor plated cab with hydraulic breaching ram and grapple claw . Extras: Night vision, thermal imaging 'IED mitigation package' Logo: 'The Real Tactical Advantage' The Rook is the latest piece of equipment to be brought in to try to find the missing man. Made by Ring Power, a company based in St. Augustine, Florida, the 13,000-pound tracked vehicle can punch holes in walls, remove cars and shield cops, and costs $245,000 and $445,000, depending on extras. On its website Ring Power describes the Rook as equipment for when law enforcement is facing 'the worst-case scenario,' such as a hostage rescue, barricaded suspects, riot scene or natural disaster. The machine's main feature is its 'Armored Deployment Platform' made from metal with 'bat wing doors', bullet-proof glass sight ports and sliding gun ports. It can be raised 11-feet to deploy snipers on roofs. It also can be fitted with a 'hydraulic breaching ram' that can punch through walls from 10 feet away and a grapple claw bulldozer-type bucket to tear into fortified structures. Cops are saying little about their latest tactics to find Frein, who has evaded capture since Trooper Bryon Dickson, 38, was shot dead on September 12. Another state trooper, Alex Douglass, 31, was shot and seriously injured. Tense: Police keep watch at the edge of a perimeter set up in a residential neighborhood in Canadensis . 'We continue to move assets around during this search as new information becomes available,' police spokeswoman, Connie Devens told MailOnline. She said some roadblocks in the area have now been lifted. Frein, described as a survivalist with an intense hatred of law enforcement, is the only suspect in the case. Dickson, an ex-Marine with two young children, was killed as troopers changed shift at the Blooming Grove barracks, 25 miles north of Canadensis. Douglass was able to crawl inside the barracks after being hit. He has undergone several surgeries and is expected to survive. A green Jeep, registered to Frein's father Michael, a retired US Army major, was found half-submerged in a pond. Inside were shell casings matching the bullets that killed Dickson, Eric Frein's social security card, camouflage face paint, a black hooded sweatshirt and information about foreign embassies. Police believe Frein failed to negotiate a junction and plowed into the pond. They say he then made his way on foot to Canadensis, a picturesque village nestled in the Poconos. The search is now concentrated on an area near where he lived with his parents. Michael Frein, 64, told police his son is an expert sharpshooter who 'doesn't miss.' At least four helicopters with thermal imaging gear have been spotted flying above the heavily wooded area where Frein, 31, is believed to be hiding out. However the heavy canopy of leaves is said to be hampering their ability to find the fugitive. On Monday police brass issued authorization over police radios to officers permitting them to shoot to kill Frein if he was spotted and refused to surrender. Protection: An armored truck at the perimeter of the search area. Much of the area has been on lockdown with some residents being unable to return to their homes during the manhunt . Hunt: Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett said during a visit to the area Monday that authorities were close to capturing Frein, but by Tuesday the search appeared no closer to finding him . Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett said during a visit to the area Monday that authorities were close to capturing Frein, but by Tuesday the search appeared no closer to finding him. Police have said they are closing in on Frein. On Monday they shared pictures of what is believed to be his AK-47, one of two weapons his father reported missing from his house, stuck barrel-down in the woods. For years Frein has taken part in MilSim – military simulation – activities, realistically re-enacting battles with using real weapons. He has a special interest in eastern Europe – particularly Serbia - and the Cold War. On his MySpace page, a photo appears to show him standing in front of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Belgrade. Frein played the part of a Serbian soldier in his re-enactments and the FBI said he had claimed to have studied Russian and Serbian and to have 'fought with Serbians in Africa.' In recent years his views are said to have become more entrenched against the federal government and particularly law enforcement. 'Based on our investigation, we know Frein has prepared and planned extensively for months or maybe years,' Pennsylvania State police Lt Col George Bivens said on Sunday. 'He planned his attack and his retreat - however, we believe we are closing in on him.' A copy of the book, 'Sniper Training and Employment,' was found in his bedroom, during a search. Following the shootings, the FBI placed him on its 10 Most Wanted List. Its wanted poster describes him as 6'1"", 165lb. State police said he changed his look, cutting his hair into a wide Mohawk as he prepared for his attack. He was also described as a heavy smoker. Gov. Corbett said police do not believe that Frein will target civilians as he had one opportunity to kill a woman and did not take it. But he said they think Frein wants to kill more police. Cold War: Frein with AK47, left, dressed as a Serbian soldier and right, the AK47 found by police in the woods . Order lifted: A Shelter In Place order for residents has been lifted but police warn residents to avoid the woods . Victims: Cpl. Bryon Dickson, left, was killed last week and Trooper Alex Douglass, right, was wounded . Locals in the area have become accustomed to convoys of 20 or even 30 police vehicles travelling along their narrow roads, and roadblocks being set up at a moment's notice as the hunt continues. The FBI, state police, officers from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and local cops have been joined by officers from neighboring New York and New Jersey. Police dogs have been sent into the woods but have not tracked Frein down. Tempers are wearing thin in the tiny village of Canadensis (pop. 2,164). Mom Melissa DePauli, 37, was forced to miss her son Harrison's third birthday last week. 'The babysitter couldn't get him back to me,' she told MailOnline. 'It was heartbreaking. I was at his birth, I should have been at his birthday,' she said. Others are finding their incomes hard hit. Plumber John Gartner, 39, who lives off Snow Hill Road, where the search has been concentrated, said he had been told that if he left the house he shares with his wife and four sons he wouldn't be allowed back. 'It's become normal to see helicopters and light planes flying overhead,' he added. 'But it's not been easy. We are getting low on food. We keep thinking it will end any day now, but it keeps going.' Residents have been urged to avoid the woods in the area until Frein is captured. Gaile Horowitz, who runs the Brookview Manor Inn in Canadensis with her husband Marty, said she has had guests come to dinner only to find they can't get home, so have had to spend the night. Other booked guests have been unable to reach the inn, she added. One man found himself trapped when he police prevented him from going home, only to turn around to find the road behind him had been closed too. Pretender: New footage emerged today of Frein in a documentary about Vietnam War re-enactment . Police spokeswoman Devens said roadblocks are moved as new information becomes available. 'If there are no roadblocks, the areas are open to all traffic,' she said. The Red Cross opened an emergency shelter in nearby East Stroudsburg on Monday night. However no-one showed up, the Poconos Record reported.  Many who have not been able to go home have slept in their cars or at local fire stations. Few locals believe that Frein is still in the area. 'I think he's either dead or in South America,' said Horowitz, a view shared by many others.

"A business was saved after a pedestrian passing the building rang the boss to say: 'Hello, it is raining – in your office.' The kind Samaritan stopped and stared in horror through the window of design firm Taylor James as torrents of water gushed from the ceiling, soaking the ground floor. The drama was captured on CCTV footage on cameras both inside and outside the premises in Shoreditch, east London. Scroll down to watch the video .

He said: 'It was a young woman who just kept saying, it’s raining, it’s raining. I looked out the window and it wasn’t so it was all very confusing. 'Finally she blurted out that it was raining inside. I thought it was some mad prank so I sent a colleague to investigate.'

"Tony Abbott has promised to 'shirtfront' Vladimir Putin over what he knows about the MH17 tragedy when the two lock horns at the G20 conference in Brisbane. But the Russian President certainly didn't look too nervous about a curtain raiser confrontation with the Australian PM in Beijing, where both leaders will briefly cross paths at the APEC summit. As Mr Abbott touched down in the Chinese capital, Mr Putin was spotted looking typically calm as met with world leaders - shaking hands, smiling for photos and even comparing phones. Mr Putin held bilateral talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, met with China's president Xi Jinping and shook hands with Chilean President Veronica Michelle Bachelet Jeria.

Cool as a cucumber: Putin rubs shoulders with Chile president Veronica Michelle Bachelet Jeria (left) and Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe (right) Prime Minister Tony Abbott  is escorted by Australian Ambassador to China Frances Adamson upon his arrival at Beijing's airport on Sunday night . Mr Putin looked relaxed as he compared smartphones with Mr Xi and an aide, and was calm as he posed for pictures before the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. Mr Abbott last night touched down in China's capital and promise 'very robust' talks with Mr Putin . 'The conversation will be, as I have said, about our absolute expectation that Russia will be as good as its word, that it will fully cooperate with the investigations that are under way and that it will do what it can to ensure that justice is done,' Mr Abbott said on Saturday. 'This is not an issue which Russia now expects to be forgotten, that this is not an atrocity which Russia thinks can be swept under the carpet'. Abbott is in China to attend the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 2014 Summit being held in Beijing from 5 to 11 November . Vladimir Putin is also expected to arrive at Beijing on Tuesday to discuss the MH17 disaster and fallout with Mr Abbott . Russian President Vladimir Putin (left) and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping (right) shake hands during a signing ceremony in Beijing on November 9 after promising ever closer cooperation . The Prime Minister grabbed global headlines after threatening to 'shirtfront' the Russian president but has since toned down his language. Instead, he insisted he would hold robust talks with the Russian president over the country's actions. Russian backed separatists shot down the plane over east Ukraine on July 17, killing all 298 people aboard including 38 Australians. 'Australians turned (to us) with an official request for a meeting during an APEC summit and we are agreeing to such a meeting in China,' Putin's top foreign policy adviser Yury Ushakov said. 'It will be short,' he added. The Russian leader is also in the Chinese capital to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit leaders' meeting . Mr Abbott waves as he boards the plane to Beijing to attend APEC from Canberra on Sunday . After consulting with other G20 members, Mr Abbott confirmed Mr Putin would not be banned from the economic leaders' summit next week. Mr Abbott said as the G20 is an international organisation which works on consensus, Australia does not have the right to bar any member from attending. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said the shirtfront comment went too far. Arriving in Beijing on Friday, Mr Abbot is expected to discuss and sign a free-trade agreement with other APEC leaders during the summit . Tough questions need to be asked during Tony Abbott's showdown with Russian President Vladimir Putin . 'In some ways that weakened our legitimate outrage,' he told ABC TV on Sunday. He hopes Mr Abbott uses the meeting as an opportunity to get to the bottom of what happened. 'Putin's not going to tell us the truth,' he said. 'But Tony Abbott has to at least ask.' Mr Abbott grabbed global headlines after pledging to 'shirtfront' Mr Putin during the G20 leader meeting . Mr Abbott has flagged a 'robust conversation' and wants Mr Putin to guarantee he's doing everything possible to help investigations . Australia should be lobbying for peace in Ukraine, as a silver lining to the 'senseless barbarity', Mr Shorten said. Recovery and investigative work at the crash site has been halted because of fighting between the government and pro-Russian separatists, despite a September ceasefire. The APEC summit, which begins on Monday and will focus on economic cooperation, marks the beginning of a whirlwind week of diplomacy for Mr Abbott, who will also visit Myanmar for Asian security talks before returning to Australia to host the G20 in Brisbane.","Vladimir Putin touches down in Beijing for APEC Summit .

"Where are they now, it is asked, those West Ham United fans who wanted Sam Allardyce out last season? Well, they are still there — and they weren’t wrong. A year ago, West Ham played lousy football, lost a lot of games and were threatened by relegation. The supporters were understandably unhappy, so much so that they actually voiced displeasure after a rare victory, at home to Hull City. The win did not compensate for the drabness of the performance, they felt. Many criticised the fans who booed, but tickets are not cheap and the purchasers were entitled to a hearing. West Ham fans are finally being entertained at Upton Park after asking for an improvement last season . Sam Allardyce is on the up at West Ham, with the Hammers sitting fourth with five wins in nine . At Upton Park, they don’t expect to win every week; but they do have a reasonable desire to be entertained. The board listened to this request. Having not located an adequate replacement for Allardyce, they asked for a more exciting style of play. To his credit, Allardyce listened — and acted. Click here to read more from Sports Writer of the Year Martin Samuel . And what do you know? With better football came an improved league position and home victories over last season’s top two, Liverpool and Manchester City. West Ham are now fourth. It will be a shock if they stay there, but shows the fans had every right to expect more. Last season, West Ham played Manchester City four times and lost every game, 14-1 on aggregate. This season, their first meeting produced a 2-1 West Ham victory and a very decent performance. So the response to Allardyce is performance-related. Not so incomprehensible, when you think about it.

"The next phase in the hunt for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 is under way after a ship with specialised sonar equipment began searching in the area where the plane is thought to have crashed. The Boeing 777 disappeared with 239 people on March 8 after veering dramatically off course between Kuala Lumpur and Beijing. The plane is thought to have been flying on autopilot at the time. Experts believe the plane crashed about 1,100 miles off the Western Australia coast, which is where the Malaysia-contracted GO Phoenix vessel began hunting for traces of wreckage or jet fuel today. The GO Phoenix will be joined later this month by two ships sent by Dutch contractor Fugro as part of an operation that could last more than a year. Scroll down for video . Search: The GO Phoenix will be joined later this month by two ships sent by Dutch contractor Fugro as part of an operation that could last more than a year . Fugro Discovery (pictured), which along with the Malaysian-contracted GO Phoenix, will soon start a new  high-resolution search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 . A three-dimensional model of the sea floor terrain, derived from satellite gravity measurements and some from ocean passage soundings. A bathymetric survey currently underway is focussed on gathering more detailed and higher resolution data in preparation for the underwater search phase . Australia's Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre said GO Phoenix will conduct operations in the area for about 12 days before sailing to Fremantle Port to be resupplied. Fugro Equator, which is currently using sonar techology to search the sea floor, is likely to be used as a general search vessel when it finishes carrying out bathymetric tests later this month. More than 68,000 square miles of the search area has been analysed and mapped so far and a massive land and sea search has failed to find any trace of the plane. GO Phoenix, the first of the vessels contracted to conduct the underwater search, departed Jakarta in Indonesia more than a week ago, after work was done to prepare the ship for the sea and weather conditions it would encounter. It began its search today, deploying underwater sonar on the end of five mile long cable that will enable it to scan the area from within 100 metres of the ocean floor. The signals the ship receives back can then give a detailed reading of the sea floor mile by mile. The new stage of the search comes after months of detailed analysis and sea bed surveys, which has indicated the aircraft should be found along a defined arc in the southern Indian Ocean, where it's believed to have run out of fuel. The primary search zone - dubbed the 'priority area' - is an arc 23,000 square miles in size - the size of Croatia - 1,120 miles off Australia's coast. One of the key issues the search team is likely to come up against over the next few months is unpredictable weather. Although the area is currently calm, huge storms and swells can emerge seemingly out of nowhere. Such conditions can badly disrupt the location of the underwater sonar cables. Images from the bathymetric survey being conducted in the latest MH370 search area: They provide information  including the contours, depths and hardness of the ocean floor to ensure the safe and effective operation of equipment in the search . These images show remnants of volcanoes, towering ridges and deep trenches that have been discovered on the seabed of the search area named Broken Ridge, an extensive linear, mountainous sea floor structure . This bathymetric survey image shows that the depth of the sea floor in one area of the search site is -5300 metres below sea level (purple) and then rises steeply to -2500 metres below sea level (red) Vessels will also be joining GO Phoenix including Furgo Discovery which has completed fit out works in Durban, South Africa and is en-route to Australia where it is expected to arrive in Fremantle on Sunday. Furgo Equator, the vessel currently being used to survey the search area, is expected to be mobilised as a search vessel when its bathymetric work is complete around the end of October. 'It's not clear how long that search will take,' Australia's Transport Minister Warren Truss told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. `We would hope, obviously, to find the aircraft on the first day, but it could in fact take a year to search the entire area and weather conditions will have an impact,' he added. Very few marine surveys have taken place in the MH370 search area. Previous mapping did not show the shape of the sea floor and only indicated ocean depth . The area being searched for MH370 has been narrowed down to a 60,000 square kilometre arc (grey) in the southern Indian Ocean, 1800km off the Australian coast . The yellow markings represent the area surveyed via bathymetric surveys . The search operation is a joint effort by Australia and Malaysia costing £31million. There has been many theories as to what happened to the Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 but there's been increased interest on the pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah who reportedly used a flight simulator at his home to plot a path to a remote island. All 12 members of staff on board the flight - including both pilots - were Malaysian nationals. Of the 227 passengers, 152 were Chinese citizens, including a group of 19 artists with six family members and four staff returning from a calligraphy exhibition of their work in Kuala Lumpur. 38 passengers were Malaysian, while the remaining 37 passengers were made up of individuals from the U.S., France, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Russia, the Netherlands, India, Ukraine, Russia, Taiwan and Indonesia.","Malaysia-contracted GO Phoenix search vessel began new hunt today .

"Mahatma Gandhi's grandson has blasted the shooting of Michael Brown and 109 other people in St Louis this year. Addressing hundreds of mothers gathered at a silent march today, Dr Arun Gandhi condemned prejudice in the city as a source of the violence, which has seen a 30 per cent leap in the number of annual homicides this year. His words came amid fresh outcry over Michael Brown's shooting as it emerged the police officer who killed him has presented a favorable account of his actions - in a move that could see him escape charges. March: Protesters assembled in St Louis,  Missouri, where the names of 110 slain citizens were read out . 'We have looked at it only as racism, and racism is a byproduct of prejudice,' he said, St Louis Public Radio reported. 'Prejudice exists in every one of us, whether we are black, white, brown, yellow. 'Whatever our color, wherever we come from, we have prejudice. It is those prejudices that spawn these kinds of byproducts like racism and gender disparities and homophobia.' Rev Traci Blackmon addressed the crowds to list all 110 slain citizens since January this year before releasing balloons into the sky. Standing outside the St Louis County Justice Center at midday today, the group held a four-minute silence for Michael Brown to recognize the four hours his body was left lying in the street after he was shot dead by police officer Darren Wilson. Emotional: Dr Arun Gandhi blamed prejudice in St Louis for the shootings of 110 people in the city this year . The protest urged mothers to make an emotional plea to police in a desperate bid to end violence in the city. Their words followed Rev Al Sharpton's fierce speech this morning condemning police officer Darren Wilson, who claims he shot Michael Brown in self-defense. Listing other black teenagers shot by white men, he also branded the shooting racist, and said: 'We were involved in Trayvon Martin. We were supportive of Jordan Davis. 'The strange thing is that all of them used the same excuse...The only gun there was Darren Wilson's! Strange parallels with all of these cases.' In his own version of events, revealed by the New York Times, the police officer told a grand jury he opened fire because the teenager was attacking him and he feared for his life. Wilson insists Brown viciously launched through the window of his police car, punching and scratching him repeatedly. Police officers are generally given more scope for lethal force if they reasonably believe that their life is in imminent danger. Anger: Hundreds of mothers gathered outside St Louis County Justice Center today in an emotional plea to police to desist from violence. Here crowds are seen holding their hands up in tribute to Michael Brown . Eventually, Wilson said, he pulled his gun from the holster on his right hip, fired two shots, and one hit Brown's arm - leaving his blood smeared inside the car and on his uniform. The account stops there and fails to explain why Brown was shot a further four times outside the vehicle. Since no other witness had a clear vantage point from which to see the incident, legal experts warn Wilson's testimony will carry significant weight for the grand jury, a legal expert told MailOnline. Slamming the account as illogical, Sharpton today raged at his weekly National Action Network rally in Harlem that it is the 'same excuse' as all other shootings of black citizens by white men. 'It sounds like a Michael Dunn defense,' he said, referring to the Florida man who has been convicted of first-degree murder for shooting dead black teenager Jordan Davis. Dunn claimed he did it because Davis was playing music too loudly. 'It didn't work in Florida and it shouldn't work in Missouri,' Sharpton added. He spluttered: 'First of all, if you stopped him - Michael Brown and his friend - walking down the street, what led to the scuffle? 'Secondly, how does he and you get in your car? You trying to do what by yourself?' Sharpton asked. 'Now, if I go with you with your story all the way to that - that Michael Brown was shot, gets up off you in the car - why are you trying to tell me that a man ran back at you when he knew you had the gun and you already shot him?'","Dr Arun Gandhi blamed prejudice in St Louis for violence and homicides .

"Thousands of North Korean labourers are working 18 hours a day to build Qatar's football world cup infrastructure while their wages are directly siphoned off to fund Kim Jong-Un's regime. The men, who are told they've been awarded the privilege of serving the dictator abroad, must meet strict criteria in order to be eligible to work overseas. This includes showing loyalty to the dictator's political party, having money to bribe migrant officials, and having a wife and children in order to dissuade defection. Scroll down for video . North Korean labourers are working from 6am to midnight in Qatar (pictured) as they build infrastructure for the country's hosting of the 2022 Football World Cup . The conditions the men work under has been described as a modern form of slavery - they start work at 6am and do not finish until midnight - working under the illusion their pay will be available to collect when they return home,The Guardian reported. The Qatar government said there were 2,800 North Koreans registered to work on Qatar's Lusail City. To be finished in time for the 2022 Football World Cup, it will be home to more than a quarter of a million residents and be capable of hosting tens of thousands more at its array of luxury hotels. It is formed by four islands and includes two luxury marinas - they will include a giraffe zoo, a snow park and a Six Flags amusement park, light rail network, two golf courses and a 86,000 seat stadium with a solar powered cooling system. However, the manner by which this stunning architectural design is achieved remains dogged by accusations the nation is using an army of modern day slaves. The Guardian reported one worker said he was paid nothing - with all earnings going back to North Korea where he believed he would be reimbursed upon his return. A more senior worker said he was paid the equivalent of £250 a month and the rest would be available for him to collect when he returned home. Choi Yunchul, a North Korean defector, told the paper: 'In the early 90s, workers did receive their salary but it has been stopped since the mid-90s. The construction company that employed workers sent all the money directly to the North Korean government's bank account.' Accusations that labourers are being poorly paid and badly treated have plagued the country's world cup preparations. Pictured is the country's capital, Doha . The Al-Khor stadium is one of many that Qatar plans to build for the 2022 Football World Cup . Aidan McQuade, Anti-Slavery International director, said the conditions under which the labourers were working constituted slave labour. He said: 'It is simply a further dreadful indictment of the dictatorship in Pyongyang, which exploits the vulnerability of its citizens to enrich itself in collusion with the Qatari autocracy.' Qatar's drive to construct stadiums and infrastructure capable of hosting a massive international event such as the world cup has been dogged by scandals. Only late last month was it was forced to refute claims that money for British firms working on the World Cup venues was being siphoned off to ISIS extremists. The Commons was told British firms awarded contracts for the project in Qatar were being short-changed while some of the unpaid cash had ended up in the hands of the Islamic extremists in Syria. But Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa Al Thani told MailOnline it was a ’serious allegation’ which the government ’refutes completely’. He said: ’Let me be clear, for the avoidance of doubt, we will stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies in the Middle East and around the world to face down the terrorist threat.’","North Korean labourers' conditions described as akin to modern day slavery .

"Cristiano Ronaldo has leapt to the defence of Real Madrid team-mate Gareth Bale, after the Wales star was criticised by their supporters at the weekend. Real fans slated Bale for failing to play in Ronaldo for an open goal in their 3-0 win at home to Espanyol on Saturday night. However, speaking at the FIFA Ballon d'Or Gala on Monday Ronaldo, who was crowned as the world's best player for a second successive year; stressed that the Bernabeu faithful know that the marauding winger is a key component in their formidable side.

Ronaldo reportedly shouted 'puta' when Bale chose to take a shot rather than pass to him in the second half . ‘Madrid fans are always the same. They are very intense, they show what they feel, they’re not liars,'  said Ronaldo. 'But I think things with Gaz will be normal because they know that Gaz is a very important player for us, a key player. The incident came in the second half of the La Liga clash at the Santiago Bernabeu when the 24-year-old raced down the right flank and failed to play in Ronaldo - who was charging through the centre. The Portuguese star reacted furiously shouting 'puta' (f***) and some supporters inside the stadium jeered Bale for having shot wide and ignoring Ronaldo. Earlier in the match Bale got himself on the scoresheet with a superbly taken free-kick . Bale leaps with joy after netting his seventh goal in La Liga this season to give Real a 2-0 lead . Having had time to reflect on that moment of the match, Ronaldo added that it should be left in the past and forgotten about. ‘What’s happened on Saturday is in the past. Sometimes I commit some mistakes too, so it’s part of the business, it is part of football so I think fans will be nice to him and they should be nice to him. ‘He’s a key player, very important for Real Madrid and we’re going to need him this year again.’ Ronaldo played an integral role for Real Madrid as they won four trophies during the previous calendar year, scoring a stunning 56 goals in 51 appearances as the Spanish giants collected the Copa del Rey, Champions League, UEFA Super Cup and the Club World Cup.

"A woman dubbed 'Jihottie' after she was cleared of smuggling money to an extremist fighter in Syria has insisted she did not get off because of her looks - on the day her friend was jailed. Nawal Msaad, 27, was found not guilty of making money available for terrorism after she was caught with £15,830 (20,000 euros) in her underwear at Heathrow Airport. A trial heard her school friend, Amal El-Wahabi, had hoodwinked her into taking the money to her husband Aine Davis, a drug dealer who went to Syria to fight in July last year. A jury found mother-of-two El-Wahabi guilty but cleared Msaad of making money available with 'reasonable cause to suspect that it would or may be used for the purposes of terrorism'. As El-Wahabi was jailed today, Ms Msaad spoke out against claims she 'got away with it', insisting both she and El-Wahabi were 'duped'. Scroll down for video . Nawal Msaad (pictured, right) - who was cleared at trial - said she had been 'stitched up'  and she never intended to fund jihad in Syria. She hit out at claims she was 'cleared because of her looks' today as her friend Amal El-Wahabi (left) was jailed . She told Channel 4 News: 'A lot of people think that I'm the smuggler who got away with it. That the jury only let me off because of my looks.' Ms Msaad said she had received abuse from Muslims after she was labelled 'Jihottie' for appearing at court in short skirts and low-cut tops. She added: 'I was supposed to be a jihadi, but there I was dressed in skirts and matching blazers. Many people couldn't handle this, . 'We live in a free country, I should be able to wear what I want. This is how I dress normally, why should I change? I am a Muslim and I am proud.' She said she and her friend knew little about the conflict in Syria before the trial, and were unaware Turkey shared a border with the war-torn country. Her comments came as El-Wahabi - the first Briton to be convicted of funding jihadists in Syria - was jailed for 28 months and seven days. Jailing the 27-year-old, Judge Nicholas Hilliard QC told her that from the evidence it was clear that Davis had gone to Syria to fight under the black flag of Isis and also that he had 'no true regard' for her. He said: 'I am also satisfied that you knew he was engaged in violence with guns for extremist religious and ideological reasons and knew the money you were sending was destined for that purpose.' Ms Msaad insisted she did not court publicity with her court outfits, saying: 'This is how I dress normally' The judge said Davis's WhatsApp profile picture showing him brandishing an automatic weapon was a 'particularly shocking image', making it clear what he was doing in Syria, along with other images he sent her posing with guns. During the trial, jurors were told how Davis, 30, who was born in London with roots in Gambia, met El-Wahabi at a London mosque and become increasingly interested in Islam six or seven years ago. He left the UK to pursue a jihadist cause in July last year, leaving El-Wahabi and her two young children to live off benefits in London. The couple stayed in touch through Skype messages and by December last year El-Wahabi had resolved to join him. Amal El-Wahabi was jailed for 28 months and seven days for sending £15,830 to her extremist boyfriend in Syria . In January, she made the arrangements for Msaad to take the cash to Istanbul in a series of phone calls and messages. Msaad, who had been studying human resources at London Metropolitan University, agreed to take the cash on the promise of 1,000 euros in expenses, jurors heard. When she was stopped at the departure gate on January 16 she said the three-day trip to Istanbul was a 'short break' to buy gold for her mother. She was taken into a private room where she produced thirty-eight 500 euro notes, four 200 euro notes and two 100 euro notes from her underwear. In her defence, Msaad said she had been 'stitched up' by her friend and she had not intended to fund jihad in Syria. El-Wahabi denied that her partner, known as Hamza, was in Syria and claimed he was in various countries abroad looking for work. But the prosecution produced a 'selfie' Davis had sent her while he was away, as well as videos containing jihadist propaganda found on computers seized from her home. Sentencing El-Wahabi today, the judge told her: 'I am satisfied that the initiative for this offence must have come from Aine Davis and you committed it because you were infatuated with him and thought he might provide for you and your two children.' The judge added: 'You even contemplated taking your children to Turkey to be nearer their father, when it should have been obvious to you it was in their interests they should be as far away from him as possible. 'He had no true regard for you. Any interest he had in you was only engaged when there was some advantage to him.' He added: 'You have two children aged five and 17 months or so, to whom you are devoted. Your children are the innocent victims of the offence you have committed and indirectly victims of what Aine Davis was engaged in. They are entirely blameless.' Aine Davis sent a photo of himself and another man brandishing a machine gun to El-Wahabi after he left . Earlier in mitigation, defence lawyer Mark Summers QC had asked the judge for a suspended sentence because of the effect on the defendant's two children and the absence of any terrorist ambition on her part. He said Davis put her under pressure and had kept up the 'constant threat' that he would end their marriage and take a second wife in Syria. The lawyer also argued that Isis in January 2014 was only engaged in a struggle in Syria and had not attempted to establish an Islamic state worldwide. But prosecutor Kate Wilkinson said that El-Wahabi's support for Davis had not just been to try to send him money. Her encouragement for his terrorist activities was illustrated by a message she sent him about going on convoy, saying: 'When does your next adventure start? I'm sure you will enjoy it. It will be good for your body and soul.' The lawyer added: 'The crown should not ignore the fact Isis' aim had always been to establish an Islamic state. Isis has grown into the power and strength it is now because of the efforts made to support it.' The judge told El-Wahabi (pictured, left) he was satisfied she knew her boyfriend was engaged in extremist violence and 'knew the money you were sending was destined for that purpose'. Nawal Msaad (right) was cleared by a jury of funding terror . Judge Hilliard had previously warned El-Wahabi, who is London-born of Moroccan descent, that an immediate custodial sentence was inevitable, although he said she was in a 'completely different category' to her husband. He told her: 'This was a substantial amount of money destined on the evidence straight to the hands of a dangerous extremist who was engaged in violent jihad with all the terror and misery that causes.' Speaking after the case, Terri Nicholson, of the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism squad, said: 'A necessary component of terrorism is finance. Whether the funding of terrorism takes place in the UK or overseas, the offences are serious and will be subject to thorough investigation. 'In this case, a large quantity of cash was seized which would otherwise have supported terrorist activity in the Syrian conflict. 'This conviction should be viewed as a very clear message not to support those engaged in terrorism. 'There are well established charities through which people can donate for humanitarian purposes in Syria. These charities have experience in providing such assistance in high risk, insecure and dangerous environments. Donations must be made via these routes.' Research by a British University found that good looks can help defendants convince jurors of their innocence. In an experiment for the academic study, a jury was found to be more likely to convict suspects deemed unattractive than those seen as good-looking. Researchers at Bath Spa University came to their conclusions after asking 96 volunteers to read a transcript of a fictitious mugging case. Half of the participants were given a picture of a suspect deemed 'attractive', the other half was presented with someone classed as 'unattractive'. Analysis of the results revealed that the supposedly attractive suspects were more likely to be acquitted, despite there being no extra evidence in their favour. Sandie Taylor, the psychologist who conducted the 2007 study, said: 'Our findings confirm previous research on the effects of defendant characteristics - such as physical attractiveness - on the deliberations of jurors. 'People who are physically attractive are assumed to be clever, successful and have more friends - it is tragic in a way.'","Amal El-Wahabi tricked friend into taking £15,830 to her jihadi boyfriend .

"The female Kurdish  fighter who became a poster girl for the Kobane resistance before allegedly being beheaded by Islamic State militants is actually alive and well, it was claimed today. The woman, known by the pseudonym Rehana, was celebrated as a symbol of hope for the besieged Syrian border city after an image of her making a peace sign was retweeted over 5,000 times. That picture was followed days later by a gruesome photograph of an ISIS terrorist holding the severed head of a young woman, sparking rumours that Rehana had been savagely murdered. But now friends of Rehana have told MailOnline that the dead woman in the photograph is in fact a different Kurdish resistance fighter, adding that Rehana managed to escape Kobane during intense fighting there last week and is now believed to be living in southern Turkey. Scroll down for video . Safe: The Kurdish fighter Rehana - who became a poster girl for the Kobane resistance before allegedly being beheaded by Islamic State militants - is actually alive and well, her friends claimed today . A huge cloud of smoke is seen following an American airstrike  in the Syrian town of Kobane this morning . Speaking of ISIS' sickening propaganda photograph, a journalist who was based in Kobane as recently as last week said the dead woman  is not Rehana but another Kurdish resistance fighter. 'She is my friend and I confirm that she is alive. And the picture of beheaded female fighter is not Rehana's picture,' he told MailOnline, speaking on condition of anonymity. He went on to say that he saw Rehana leave Kobane during intense fighting there last week, shortly before he was forced to do the same thing. Although he lost temporarily lost contact with Rehana as they made their separate journeys over the nearby Turkish border, the journalist said he has been informed by friends that she is living as a refugee in Turkey, most likely in the southern Şanliurfa Province. 'She is in Turkey. I will try to gain her number because I lost the connection with her. She evacuated Kobane and I stayed in Kobane. At the beginning of the last clashes Rehana left Kobane,' he said. Brave: Thousands of Syrian Kurdish women are battling the Islamic State in Syria, many of them in Kobane . MailOnline also spoke to another friend of Rehana's who confirmed the dead woman in the sickening ISIS photograph was not Rehana, who she described as 'the daughter of a martyr'. 'The facial features [of the head in the ISIS photo] are not hers,' she said, refusing to give her name. However the friend claimed she was not with Rehana, had not seen her since the time the photograph emerged, and no longer had any way of contacting her. 'I can give news on her, but I don't want to talk until I get someone's advice... A person in Kobane has refuted this news [that she is dead], and I'm going to speak to him again tomorrow,' the friend said. 'Everyone's asking about her, using her. And I don't want to talk about her,' she went on to say. The friends' claims that Rehana is still alive was reinforced by others who says they know Rehana and have spoken to her in recent days. Among those claiming to have communicated with Rehana is the Syrian/Kurdish journalist Rashad Abdel Qader. Qader said rumours that she had singlehandedly killed 100 ISIS fighters inside Kobane were untrue, but claimed she was still 'fighting fiercely'. A female Kurdish fighter takes up a position during combat skills training before being deployed to fight ISIS . The suggestion Rehana may still be alive was first raised by the Swedish freelance journalist Carl Drott, who said he had met her during a ceremony in which the Kurdish YPJ, or Women's Defense Unit, was first set up in Kobane. He said the dead woman in the ISIS photograph may initially look like Rehana, but on closer inspection her facial features and hair style and colour betrayed subtle differences. He also said that as Rehana had left a law degree in Aleppo to fight join the fight in her hometown Kobane, she hadn't received the level of training required to become a full member of the YPJ and so worked as a reservist, providing support to those on the frontline. Such claims might it highly unlikely she would have been able to singlehandedly kill 100 ISIS fighters, as per the rumours that spread when the photograph of her making the peace sign first emerged. Syrian Kurds gather in the Turkish town of Suruc for the funeral of Kurdish fighters killed by ISIS in Kobane . The news that Rehana is almost certainly still alive came as Kurdish resistance fighters continue to push the Islamic State back in Kobane. Among those fighters are thousands of women, an unusual phenomenon in the Muslim world in which warfare is often associated with manhood. In April, Kurdish fighters created all-female combat units that have grown to include more than 10,000 women. These female fighters have played a major role in battles against IS, said Nasser Haj Mansour, a defense official in Syria's Kurdish region. The Kurdish women now find themselves battling militants preaching an extreme form of Islam dictating that women only leave the house if absolutely necessary. One Kurdish female fighter, who uses the nom de guerre of Afshin Kobani, used to be a teacher. Now, the Kurdish Syrian woman has traded the classroom for the front lines in the battle for the town. The 28-year-old Kurdish fighter said she decided to join the fight in her hometown when she saw Isis advances in Syria. 'I lost many friends to this, and I decided there was a need to join up,' said Kobani, who declined to reveal her birth name. 'This is our land - our own - and if we don't do it, who else will?' The funeral for three Kurdish  fighters who died fighting ISIS in Kobane was held in Suruc, Turkey last week . Young Kurdish in Suruc, Turkey men paint the tombstone of a YPG fighter killed over the border in Kobane . After more than a year of fighting, Kobani has risen through the ranks to become a commander of a mixed-gender unit. 'We are just the same as men; there's no difference,' she said. 'We can do any type of job, including armed mobilization.' There is nothing new about Kurdish women fighters. They have fought alongside men for years in a guerrilla war against Turkey, seeking an independent Kurdistan which would encompass parts of Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran. The campaign for Kurdish independence has been pursued mainly by leftist militant groups that championed gender equality, such as the Kurdistan Workers Party in Turkey. Suicide bombings have long been part of the Kurdish women fighters' battleground repertory. Early this month, Deilar Kanj Khamis, better known by her military name Arin Mirkan, blew herself up outside Kobani, killing 10 IS fighters, according to Kurdish forces. Haj Mansour, the Kurdish defense official, recounted that Kurdish fighters were forced to withdraw from a strategic hill south of the besieged town. Khamis stayed behind, attacking IS fighters with gunfire and grenades as they moved in. Earlier this month the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors events in Syria, reported ISIS militants beheaded nine Kurdish fighters, including three women . Surrounded, she detonated explosives strapped to her body. The Kurds then recaptured the position - but lost it again on Wednesday. Earlier this month the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors events in Syria, reported Isis militants beheaded nine Kurdish fighters, including three women, captured in clashes near Turkish border. The news that Rehana is almost certainly still alive comes as militants from the Al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front attacked the government-held Syrian city of Idlib, killing dozens of soldiers loyal to the regime and temporarily taking control of a number of buildings. The militants were later pushed back into the outskirts of the city, which has been held by the government after being briefly seized by rebel forces in 2012. Do you know Rehana?

"As beautiful as it is here in San Sebastian, the startling contrast between Manchester United and Real Sociedad would not have been lost on David Moyes. The Volkswagen that collected him from the airport and delivered him to the club’s picturesque Zubieta training ground might not have been much of a culture shock. But the training ground car park was populated predominantly by Volkswagens, too, suggesting the wage bill is inferior to the average Premier League club, never mind United. VIDEO Scroll down for David Moyes arrives in Spain ahead of signing with Real Sociedad . David Moyes was appointed as Real Sociedad's new manager on Monday night . Moyes (right) was given a tour around the Spanish club's training facilities on Wednesday . Moyes (back centre) watched on as his newly-inherited squad trained in front of their new manager . This, however, is not something that will trouble Moyes. Indeed he appears so keen to embrace what this modest football club represents he has decided to select his coaching assistants from staff already at the club after the invitation he extended to Phil Neville to join him was declined. It says something for the confidence Moyes has in his own ability that he arrived here alone on Wednesday and will remain that way until he builds up more of a rapport with Imanol Alguacil and Erik Bretos. Alguacil has been promoted from Sociedad’s B team to become Moyes’ deputy; a move that will be popular among players and supporters given that the 43-year-old is a Basque who spent seven years as a player at the club. Bretos will be his Jose Mourinho to Bobby Robson; a young coach from the club’s successful academy who has a good command of English. That is something Moyes will need until he learns Spanish. The Scot was all smiles as he strode round the training ground in San Sebastian . Moyes was soon pictured on the phone as he started his new adventure in Spain . The former Manchester United boss arrives at the Zubieta training ground (left) and looks at one of his players . Moyes did say hello in Basque - ‘Kaixo’ - to the assembled media before meeting his new employers and watching Alguacil put his new players through their paces on the training pitch. His choice of deputies would suggest Moyes is taking a slightly different approach from the one he employed at Old Trafford, even if it was unfair to suggest he dispensed with all of Sir Alex Ferguson’s staff there. He did, after all, ask Rene Meulensteen to become assistant manager. Here in San Sebastian they are far more interested in what Moyes achieved at Everton than the difficult 10 months he endured at United. Real Sociedad captain Xabi Prieto (left) hopes Moyes can recreate his success with Everton at the club . They see themselves as the Everton of La Liga; a club with aspirations to compete regularly in Europe without breaking the bank. Xabi Prieto, the Sociedad captain and a one-club man, is thrilled that Moyes has taken the job. ‘He has a very big reputation in the game and all the players want him to do the same for us here as he did with Everton,’ he said. ‘I am excited about what he can bring to the team. He is a big name and I think it is a big thing for the players here to have him.’ Real Sociedad were looking for a new manager after Jagoba Arrasate was relieved of his duties . Imanol Lizasoain, the Real Sociedad correspondent for the city newspaper Diario Vasco, was similarly enthusiastic. ‘People expect him to give character to the team,’ he said. ‘The last coach was shy, a former teacher who wasn’t really known. He didn’t express himself so much to the players. He was quiet. ‘The fans worried that there was not so much aggression in the team. That is what they expect from Moyes, coming from England and the Premier League. They want him to give the team some fight because there are good players, capable of finishing in the top six.’ On Monday that same local newspaper claimed former West Bromwich Albion manager Pepe Mel was offered the job only hours before Moyes, then contacted the club president - after eight days of considering the offer - to say he would come. Moyes will stand in the dugout at the impressive Anoeta Stadium in San Sebastian where Sociedad play . Mel might have been used to apply some pressure when club president Jokin Aperribay always wanted Moyes. But it is also interesting to read claims here that Moyes agreed to an 18-month contract after initially being offered four years. Aperribay is just happy to have his man. ‘In David Moyes we have a manager with a big name in football with a great reputation,’ he said. ‘It brings a real international coach to Real Sociedad. It is great news for the players and I believe he is someone who can have us back in European football.’ An international name Moyes might be, but on this occasion he has chosen to call more on local expertise. Former West Brom manager Pepe Mel was also in the running for Soceidad position before Moyes took it .

"Gary Neville has urged Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal to stick with playing four at the back for the rest of the season. The Red Devils started with three central defenders for Saturday's Barclays Premier League win at QPR, but it was only once they switch to a flat back-four that Marouane Fellaini and James Wilson struck to seal the points. Fans are desperate for the Dutchman to ditch his more favoured 3-5-2 formation, and former United full-back agrees with the Old Trafford faithful. Gary Neville has urged Manchester United to stick with playing four at the back for the rest of the season . The Reds switched to a back-four before Marouane Fellaini and James Wilson struck to seal the points . United supporters are desperate for their manager to ditch his more favoured 3-5-2 formation . Louis van Gaal switched to a 4-4-2 formation during Saturday's 2-0 win at QPR . He told Monday Night Football: 'Louis van Gaal wants them to recycle the ball and switch the play. I'm not a fan of 3-5-2 because the centre-backs are the free men and they become the safe option. 'They play out from the back but the tempo is too slow. Far too often they are keeping possession and passing it backwards. 'They've become quite predictable in the past few weeks. Manchester United looked far more dangerous on Saturday when they changed the system. 'Fans want them to go 2-0 up and then keep possession rather than fight for goals near the end.' Van Gaal has been keen to strengthen his options at back by looking at Borussia Dortmund's Mats Hummels during the January transfer window. Frustrated fans, pictured celebrating, were screaming ‘4-4-2’ during their side's initial struggles at Loftus Road . Gary Neville has called for Van Gaal to ditch his favoured 3-5-2 formation . Yet the 26-year-old German international could be prepared to stay in the Bundesliga, even if Dortmund fail to qualify for the Champions League. Qualification to be among Europe's elite looks extremely unlikely given they are 12 points behind fourth place, but Hummels appears prepared to wait it out. Speaking to Die Welt, Hummels said: 'We have worked to the maximum in every game but a few times but opponents were better than us. We have to get up and move up the ranks as soon as possible.

"The Department of Justice's top communications official plotted to squash a reporter who aggressively covered the agency's ill-fated Operation Fast and Furious gun scandal in 2011, previously secret emails show. The emails, between the DOJ's then-communications chief Tracy Schmaler and White House press flack Eric Schultz, are a rare look inside the Obama administration's press control machine. They were released Thursday while the nation was preoccupied with President Barack Obama's immigration policy announcement, as the result of a long-languishing Freedom Of Information Act lawsuit filed by the center-right watchdog group Judicial Watch. In one message, Schmaler told Schultz that CBS journalist Sharyl Attkisson needed to be reined in, writing that she was 'calling Sharryl's [sic] editor and reaching out to Scheiffer. She's out of control.' TARGETED: The Justice Department tried to rein in award-winning television journalist Sharyl Attkisson after she reported critically on the Fast and Furious gun scandal . Attorney General Eric Holder told Congress in 2011 that he had only learned of the deadly gun 'walking' program 'for the first time over the last few weeks,' but Attkisson published documents that proved otherwise . Schieffer refers to CBS news anchor Bob Schieffer, a journalist who has enjoyed a chummy relationship with the Obama White House. He interviewed the president two weeks ago in a rare on-camera appearance. Schmaler hatched her plan a day after Attkisson reported on documents showing Attorney General Eric Holder was sent briefings on the Fast and Furious operation beginning in 2010. That directly contradicted his sworn statements to Congress. In May 2011 Holder told a House Judiciary Committee panel that 'I'm not sure of the exact date, but I probably heard about Fast and Furious for the first time over the last few weeks.' The House of Representatives later held Holder in criminal Contempt of Congress for failing to turn over subpoenaed documents related to the scandal. In her emails, Schmaler told Schultz that she had 'I spent much of last night explaining to everyone it's a bulls**t accusation.' Attkisson, who left CBS a year ago over concerns that the network was reflexively killing stories that were critical of the administration, told MailOnline that the federal government's backroom plotting was in line with what she experienced previously. 'This is just the tip of the iceberg. ... Now people have a black and white email from the perpetrators to see for themselves what I've long known,' she said. Operation Fast and Furious was a program that the involved Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives – a subagency of the DOJ – encouraging gun dealers to knowingly sell weapons to 'straw buyers' who intended to traffick them across the Mexican border. FIGHTING BACK: Attkisson spills the beans in a new book about how the government impedes the work of reporters . The administration intended to track the guns, hopefully to Mexican drug cartels, but lost control of two-thirds of the 2,000 firearms involved. One was the weapon that killed a U.S. Border Patrol agent, and others were tied to hundreds of deaths of Mexican nationals. 'Think about the outrage,' Attkisson said Friday. 'They are angry not that Dept. of Justice employees embarked upon an ill-advised cross-border operation to arm Mexican drug cartels, or that the Attorney General provided conflicting testimony before Congress: They're mad that I did my job and reported on it.' The Justice Department was at one point forced to retract testimony that denied the government was knowingly 'walking' guns into Mexico. 'Also, it appears to be wholly inappropriate use of presidential executive privilege,' she said, referring to the White House's years-long delay in releasing the trove of emails. 'There is nothing in this email that legally justifies why the president would have invoked executive privilege to keep it secret from the public and Congress all this time until forced by a lawsuit to turn it over.' Schultz did not respond to a request for comment. Schmaler could not be reached Friday. The emails also include an indication that the Justice Department provided leaked documents to a National Journal reporter in order to counter Attkisson's reporting. 'I sent NJ's Susan Davis your way,' Schmaler told Schultz. 'She's writing on [Rep. Darrell] Issa/FandF and I said you could load her up on the leaks, etc.' Issa, the hard-charging House Oversight Committee chairman from Califonia, was the most aggressive pit bull chasing the scandal in Congress at the time. Schultz seemed disappointed that Davis was the only high-profile journalist to write a follow-up story that took the administration's side. 'Why do you think nobody else wrote?' he asked. 'Were they not fed the docs?' CONSPIRATORS? Tracy Schmaler (left) and Eric Schultz (right) discussed frankly how to supply some reporters with documents while they tried to restrain others . Schultz was later promoted within the administration and now holds the position of principal deputy press secretary, briefing reporters at the White House and aboard Air Force One when Press Secretary Josh Earnest is unavailable. Attkisson's book, 'Stonewalled,' chronicles her experiences. Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton said in a statement that the tranche of emails released Thursday 'are a road map to the Obama administration’s Fast and Furious cover-up and deadly lies.' He told MailOnline on Friday that 'it is disturbing to see top officials at the Obama White House and Justice Department targeting a journalist for destruction because she dared published the truth.' 'I wonder: Just how big is Obama enemies list?' 'President Obama’s dishonest assertion of executive privilege over this material would have embarrassed Richard Nixon,' he said.

"Villagers have branded two council Christmas trees the worst in Britain - 'and possibly the world'. The threadbare living firs prompted derision when they were planted in patches of grass in the Greater Manchester villages of Mottram and Micklehurst. Locals in Mottram even set up a Facebook campaign called 'Embarrassment of Mottram Christmas Tree!' and adorned it with tinsel and baubles themselves. Scroll down for video . Humbug! The council Christmas tree in Micklehurst, Greater Manchester, has just a solitary string of fairy lights (left) - while in Mottram, locals have bought their own baubles and tinsel to make it less dismal (right) Resident Ian Gauld said of the tree in Micklehurst (above): 'It's got to be the worst anywhere in the UK. It's absolutely rubbish. It's just a waste of time. Unless someone points it out you don't even notice it' One poster on the group suggested Mottram had the 'Worst Xmas tree in the UK / possibly the world'. Five miles away in Micklehurst, that village's tree still has the only decoration sanctioned by cash-strapped officials - a solitary string of fairy lights. Tameside Council, which has had to cut £142million from its budgets over five years, insisted the trees were a low-cost way of celebrating the festive season. The firs will not be ripped from the ground in January and will instead be left to grow, providing the villages with a larger tree each year. But that excuse did not prevent a backlash. Mottram hairdresser Louise Downing said: 'I thought the tree was a quite appalling. It's normally about 7ft - this one just looks like the top of last year's tree. Tinsel town: At one point, the fairy lights on the tree in Micklehurst (pictured) did not even work . Holly insufficient: Hairdresser Louise Downing (right) is one of those who has decorated the tree in Mottram, pictured left at night before it received a makeover by community-minded residents of the village . 'We normally have a lot of flowers in the summer but there hasn't been this year. I do think it's nice that people have tried to sort it out a little bit, it's gone some way making up for the state the tree was in.' Cleaner Jessie Rebbitt, 33, added: 'We have a lot of pride in the area so to get something like this is appalling. How's that for a merry Christmas? 'The way things are at the moment people need something to look forward to and that's nothing to smile about. That's not going to bring people closer together in a good way. It's just going to bring people closer to complain.' In Micklehurst locals are hoping for some homespun decorations in their village, too. Ian Gauld, 57, said: 'At the moment the tree's pathetic and got to be the worst anywhere in the UK. 'It's absolutely rubbish. It's just a waste of time. Unless someone points it out you don't even notice it. It's hiding behind the lamp post.' Student Alex Bradley, 19, added: 'It's that small I thought somebody would nick it, but it's not even worth nicking. It's like a twig.' Not everyone was a fan of the community spirit in Mottram, however. Linda DeCarle, 68, said: 'They should have left it alone. They have made it worse. If you can't do it properly don't do it.' A spokesman for Labour-run Tameside Council said the trees were 'sustainable' and 'designed to provide a tree for many years to come'. Parish council minutes suggested the living trees cost around £1,600 each - compared to £2,000 each for temporary trees, a sum which would have to be paid again in full the next year. 'As is widely accepted local authorities up and down the country are facing huge cuts to their budgets so are continually under pressure to find more innovative ways of working,' the spokesman added. 'By providing living trees as a one-off cost the trees can be re-used year-on-year without the additional costs attached to erecting and taking down a new tree every Christmas.

"A British Marine has been questioned by police on suspicion he was travelling to fight with Kurdish militias in Syria and Iraq during time off work. The 22-year-old is in the Royal Marine Commandos and was quizzed as he prepared to fly from California on a one-way ticket to Turkey. He is suspected of planning to join Kurdish forces fighting Islamic State militants. The Marine is understood to have been due to go on leave, but it is unclear whether he was planning to return to his regiment after fighting for the Kurds. US officials said he was believed to have been in online contact with a Kurdish group that has links in Turkey and the Kurdish frontline city of Irbil – the headquarters of Peshmerga units leading the fight against IS. A British Marine has been quizzed by police on the suspicion he was travelling to fight with Kurdish militia. File picture used . The Marine, who is understood not to be a Muslim, is serving with 45 Commando. The unit is based at Condor barracks in Arbroath, Scotland, but has recently been training with US marines in the Californian desert. He was stopped two weeks ago while trying to board a flight from Los Angeles to Istanbul. His one-way ticket rang ‘alarm bells’, officials said. His luggage, phone and laptop are all said to have been examined. He was returned to 45 Commando before being questioned by Scottish police on arrival in the UK. Both Britain and the US have security operations to track down those contacting jihadi and Kurdish groups online. But the suggestion a serving British soldier was considering joining the fight against IS will be a cause of grave concern for military chiefs. Sources last night confirmed that a Marine had been questioned and released without charge by civilian police in Scotland. A Navy spokesman said: ‘We are aware of an incident involving a Royal Marine who has recently been interviewed by Police Scotland.’ He did not comment on the suggestion that the man was going to fight for Kurdish forces against IS, adding: ‘The matter is being investigated by the Royal Marines. It would be inappropriate to comment further.’ Sources stressed that ‘no criminal offence’ had been committed. Thick smoke rises from an airstrike by the U.S.-led coalition in the heavily-contested Kurdish city of Kobane. It's suspected the Marine was trying to make his way to Syria via Turkey . In this photo, the flags of Turkey (bottom right) and the Islamic State (top left) can been seen at opposite sides of the city of Kobane. But security officials pointed out the propaganda value to IS of a serving UK serviceman being captured then paraded – prior to what they believe would be ‘certain beheading’. They highlighted how IS used the fact that aid worker David Haines had served in the RAF for propaganda before he was murdered on video by the Briton known as Jihadi John. More than 500 Britons are fighting for jihadists in Syria and Iraq – many of them for IS – with five or six recruits travelling from the UK to join up each week. A small number of British passport holders are known to be fighting for Kurdish Peshmerga forces in Iraq, but it is unclear how many are in Syria. While those fighting for jihadi groups have been the focus of a security and intelligence operation to identify and stop them on return, it is not known what will happen to those fighting for Kurdish groups. Britain is training and supplying arms to Kurdish fighters battling IS. With all UK flights to Turkey being monitored, many of those planning to join fighters are known to be using different modes of transport to other European countries before continuing to the Syrian border.","A British Marine is suspected of trying to take up arms with Kurdish militia .

"Rayan Wilson (right) has been told he can carry on claiming benefits despite being filmed playing football for a pub team in a Sunday league . A man who was filmed playing football despite claiming he could often barely walk has been found not guilty of a £50,000 benefit fraud. Rayan Wilson, 29, has the rare genetic blood condition sickle-cell anaemia. He was granted the top rate of disability living allowance in 2003 after telling Department for Work and Pensions officials he often had to crawl rather than walk. However, assessors became suspicious in 2011 when he told them he was working  in injury rehabilitation at Bristol Rovers  Football Club for three to seven hours a week. Investigators then filmed him making slide-tackles as star midfielder for a pub team in a Sunday football league. Mr Wilson told Bristol Crown Court that his condition fluctuates and on many days he can only walk six to eight yards. Prosecuting, Francisca Da Costa said: ‘He was observed playing football, running, jumping, making sliding tackles.’ But Tom Wainwright, defending, gave  evidence from sickle-cell doctors that Mr Wilson’s condition – in which the blood cannot carry enough oxygen – is variable. His clinical coordinator, Dr Mark Critchley, said Mr Wilson was admitted to hospital 19 times between 2003 and 2013.

"New video from a Salt Lake City police officer's body camera shows the moment he opened fire and shot dead an unarmed man in August. Prosecutors released the footage on Tuesday as they announced that they had ruled the shooting of 20-year-old Dillon Taylor was justified. The video shows Officer Bron Cruz arrive at a 7-11 on August 11 after police were called on a report that 'gangbangers' had 'flashed a gun' in the area. As two other men raised their hands and surrender, Taylor can be seen walking away from the officer. Cruz draws his pistol as he screams 'Get your hands out now! Get 'em out!' Taylor can be heard saying: 'Nah, fool.' Scroll down for video (WARNING: Graphic content) Deadly encounter: Officer Bron Cruz's body camera and microphone captured his shooting of Dillon Taylor on August 11 in Salt Lake City. Taylor can be seen here walking away from the officer . The final moment: Taylor turned around with his hands in his pants (left) then lifted his shirt with one hand still concealed (right). It was at this moment that Cruz pointed his pistol and fire twice - fatally wounding Taylor . When Taylor turns around to face Cruz, both of his hands are in his sweatpants. He then lifts up his shirt with one hand as while his other remains in his pants. Cruz fires two shots in quick succession, striking Taylor in the chest and the abdomen. The shooting came just two days after unarmed teen Michael Brown was gunned down by an officer in Ferguson, Missouri. Taylor's death sparked outrage from much of the public in Salt Lake City and fury from his family. Marchers protested the killing as unlawful and unjustified. However, on Tuesday, Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill said that Cruz had every reason to believe that Taylor was armed and dangerous. 'By the time Dillon drew his hands from his waistband, Officer Cruz’s belief that Dillon was presenting a weapon was reasonable,' he said, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. The shooting death of Taylor, which came two days after the slaying of an unarmed teen in Ferguson, Missouri, sparked protests in the streets of Salt Lake City . Taylor crumpled to the ground after being shot in the chest and the abdomen. He was not armed - nor were the friends he was with when the police arrived . Cleared: Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill announced Tuesday that he had cleared Cruz of wrongdoing and said he acted within his training - even though police . Gill also suggested that Taylor may have been committing 'suicide by cop.' The 20-year-old had a felony warrant out for his arrest at the time and had posted on Facebook days earlier: 'I feel my time is coming soon, my nightmears are telling me. im gonna have warrants out for my arrest soon ... ill die before I go do a lot of time in a cell.' Taylor's family say he could not hear the officer's instructions to show his hands because he had earphones in and was blasting music. A toxicology report found his blood alcohol level was 0.18percent at the time . They also faulted officers for making assumptions about the danger Taylor posed based only on the word of a 911 caller who had claimed: 'They’re obviously looking for trouble, just the way they look.' The shooting is still under review by Salt Lake police and Cruz could still potentially face disciplinary action from the department. The prosecutor's ruling means he will not face criminal charges. Cruz told investigators after the shooting: 'I was scared to death. The last thought I had go through my mind when I pulled the trigger ... was that ‘I was too late. I was too late.’ And because of that I was gonna get killed.'","Officer Bron Cruz shot Dillon Taylor twice after responding to a call about armed men in Salt Lake City, Utah .

"British 'psycho' banker Rurik Jutting was today sent for psychiatric tests to determine if he is fit to stand trial for the murders of two Indonesian prostitutes. Jutting, 29, originally from Cobham, Surrey, appeared in a short court hearing in Hong Kong this morning charged with the double murder. The judge adjourned proceedings for two weeks while the psychiatric assessments are carried out and the banker was remanded in custody. As he left court, Jutting was pictured chuckling in the back of a prison van surrounded by security guards wearing face masks. His lawyer, who did not speak during the hearing, said he had not yet agreed to take part in a police reconstruction at the crime scene, but did not rule out giving consent in future. Scroll down for video . Seeing the funny side: British banker Rurik Jutting laughs as he sits in a prison van leaving the eastern court   in Hong Kong after his case was adjourned for two weeks of psychiatric reports ahead of his murder trial . Relaxed: The judge adjourned proceedings for two weeks while the psychiatric assessments are carried out . Jutting, bearded and wearing black-rimmed glasses, remained impassive during the brief hearing at the Eastern Magistrate's court - his second appearance after being charged with the murders a week ago. He spoke only once to say 'I do' when the magistrate asked him whether he understood the arrangements. The case was 'adjourned... for two psychiatric reports on the defendant's fitness to plead', said principal magistrate Bina Chainrai. Reports by two different doctors are required under Hong Kong law, said prosecutor Louise Wong who confirmed Jutting is being held at the maximum-security Siu Lam psychiatric centre. He will next appear in court on November 24. Following the hearing, Hong Kong solicitor Michael Vidler, who is also acting in Jutting's defence, said it could be months before a plea is entered. Sumarti Ningsih, 23, was found dead in a suitcase at Cambridge-educated Jutting's apartment in the former British colony's Wan Chai district earlier this month. Police had been called to the property on Halloween night and first found 29-year-old Seneng Mujiasih with wounds to her throat and buttocks. She died a short time later. Jutting moved to Hong Kong from London in July last year and is understood to have quit his highly-paid job at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in the days before the incident. Remanded: A lawyer for Jutting, who did not speak during the hearing, said he had not yet agreed to take part in a police reconstruction at the crime scene, but did not rule out giving consent in future . Accused: Jutting, 29, appeared in a short court hearing in Hong Kong today charged with the double murder . Tight security: Two Indonesian women were found dead at Cambridge-educated Jutting's apartment in the former British colony's Wan Chai district earlier this month . Before leaving, he appeared to have set a sinister automatic response for his email account at the bank. The email response read: 'I am out of the office. Indefinitely. For urgent enquiries, or indeed any enquiries, please contact someone who is not an insane psychopath. 'For escalation please contact God, though suspect the devil will have custody (Last line only really worked if I had followed through).' His appearance in court came after an Indonesian nanny claimed she was allegedly invited back to his flat prior to the killings, but turned down his offer because she thought he was 'acting strangely'. The former public schoolboy was arrested after calling police to his £2,000-a-month high-rise flat following a night out at the Makati Pub & Disco. It was at the nightclub prior to his arrest that he reportedly began chatting to the mother-of-three, who has lived in the former British colony for four years and works as a nanny for a Hong Kong Chinese family. She claimed he approached her and a friend at the bar and said: 'Hi, girls. Where are you from? How old are you?' before buying them a round of drinks. After just minutes of chatting, he allegedly asked the nanny to return to his apartment with him but she said she denied his request because of his 'strange' behaviour. Sumarti Ningshi, a mother-of-one from Indonesia, was killed and stuffed into a suitcase at Jutting's flat . Tragic: Seneng Mujiasih, who used the pseudonym Jesse Lorena Ruri, moved from her village in Indonesia to start a new life in Hong Kong after telling her parents that she was going to work in a restaurant . More than 100 people attended a vigil for the two victims today, where many called for 'justice' for the women . She told The Telegraph's Tom Phillips: 'I said: ""No, I'm with my friends. He was just walking around and around and around. 'He looked happy but I didn't understand why he was moving around all the time.' The woman, who is believed to be in her 30s, said she had witnessed Jutting pacing the club, occasionally grabbing women, before he approached her. Her comments come after it was revealed Jutting contacted his ex-girlfriend Ariane Guarin last month asking if she would fly out to visit him in Hong Kong. The message sent to the 22-year-old nightclub hostess from the Philippines was abrupt and to the point. It simply said: ‘Did you get your passport? If so, do you want to come to Hong Kong this weekend? And stay the week?' Prior to his arrest, Jutting, who studied at Cambridge University, sent a message to his former girlfriend of six months, Ariane Guarin (pictured together above), asking her to fly over to Hong Kong to visit him for a week . Miss Guarin, who had a six-month relationship with Jutting, said she felt 'lucky' not to have flown out to stay with him. She said: ‘I had a problem applying for my passport because I don’t have a valid identity card. 'He wanted me to stay for a week with him but I couldn’t go without a passport. 'I feel lucky. I am really thankful that it wasn’t me.’ Earlier today, more than 100 people attended a vigil for the two victims, who were both sex workers in Hong Kong's red light district. Jutting allegedly invited a nanny back to his apartment prior to the two killings after buying her a round of drinks at Makati nightclub (above), but she turned him down because she thought he was . Rurik Jutting's J Residence apartment building, where the bodies of the two women were found . Ms Ningsih's cousin, Jumiati, said at the vigil that she had last seen her relative in August in their home village in Indonesia. Jumiati, who goes by only one name, said she called police about a week ago to report that her cousin was missing and was later asked to identify her body. 'I hope the killer will be punished and will feel the same as what has been done to my cousin,' she said at the vigil. Susiati, a friend of the victim, broke down in tears as she remembered Ms Ningsih, who had a five-year-old son back home. 'I have lost my best friend, and I am devastated,' she said. Several in the crowd held signs demanding reforms to Hong Kong and Indonesian laws governing how domestic workers can find work and how long they can stay in the city.","Cambridge graduate is sent for tests to determine if he is fit to stand trial .

"Modern scouts learn to ‘be prepared’ for adult life and it seems that little has changed in almost 2,000 years. Ancient papyri show that wealthy Roman children were enrolled in a youth organisation in order to learn to be good citizens too. The documents, which originate from Oxyrhynchos in Egypt, also reveal that poorer children and even slaves became apprentices, while girls remained at home. Ancient papyri show that wealthy Roman children (illustrated in this Mosaic from late antiquity rising on a camel) were enrolled in a youth organisation called a gymnasium in order to learn to be good citizens. It was the Roman equivalent of The Scouts . Historians Ville Vuolanto of the University of Oslo and April Pudsey of the University of Newcastle, are working through 7,500 ancient documents discarded in 500AD in Oxyrhynchos, which had 25,000 inhabitants. The documents are thought to be around 2,000 years old. The town was home to Egypt's most important weaving industry and the Roman administrative centre for the area. From 1890 onwards, archaeologists have discovered a great deal of papyri after stumbling across an ancient rubbish heap. The documents, which originate from Oxyrhynchos in Egypt, (marked on this map) also reveal that poorer children and even slaves became apprentices, while girls remained at home . The Oxyrhynchos papyri are a group of manuscripts discovered in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by archaeologists including Bernard Pyne Grenfell and Arthur Surridge Hunt at an ancient rubbish dump near Oxyrhynchos in Egypt. They date from the first to sixth centuries AD. The collection includes thousands of Greek and Latin documents, letters and literary works. Among the text found at the site are fragments of plays and early non-canonical gospels as well as early Christian hymns, prayers and letters. Discarded receipts and administrative documents are giving experts a glimpse of the social, economic and political life of the ancient world. Their ordinariness makes such documents a treasure trove for social historians. The historians are combing through the texts, which include personal letters and administrative documents, to study what childhood was like for people at the time. They have discovered that boys born to wealthy Egyptian, Greek and Roman families joined the Roman equivalent of The Scouts – a youth organisation called the gymnasium. The boys would have belonged to the '12 drachma tax class' and Dr Vuolanto thinks that between 10 and 25 per cent of the town’s population would have belonged to this class. However, girls were not allowed to join. The boys would have learned skills to make them model citizens at the gymnasium. He told MailOnline that the gymnasium was a place that was originally used as a sports centre for wrestling and running, as well as weapons training. But evidence of this was not found in Roman Egypt. 'It seems  that it was maybe more a place for socialising and learning in general  than a sports facility as such - and even less a place to practice for war. In the gymnasium the boys ideally developed ""a sound mind in a sound body,"" by the help of their teachers and coaches of sports. 'Simultaneously they learned a lifestyle proper to their privileged class, with ""classical"" Greco-Roman learning - called paideia - learning skills and proper ways to serve their city. And what was important they made connections among themselves for their future life. Dr Pudsey added: 'Children of the urban elite would attend the gymnasium and learn how to be good citizens, in part through sports and athletic games in a very classical tradition - one document tells us about match-fixing in a boys' wrestling match! 'It was different from schools because the focus was less on reading and writing, and more on growing up to conserve the values of a particular social group with a very distinct heritage in the city. 'Even when children did learn reading and writing, they would be reading the great classical Greek poets like Homer and Callimachus.' Historians are combing through papyri (pictured), which include personal letters  and administrative documents, to study what childhood was like for people at the time . This papyrus sheds light on living conditions for children living with grandparents in Oxyrhynchos . Less wealthy children typically started working before their teens and may have served an apprenticeship for between two and four years – likely in the weaving industry. The historians know this because they found 20 apprenticeship contracts in Oxyrhynchos. Males were not considered to be adults until they married in their early 20s, while girls stayed at home to learn the skills needed to become a good wife. Dr Vuolanto said: ‘We have found only one contract where the apprentice was a girl but her situation was a little unusual - she was not only an orphan but also had her deceased father's debts to pay.’ Interestingly, slave children could also become apprentices and they were given the same type of contracts as free-born citizens. While apprentices may have given slave children prospects, life was hard for slave children in Roman Egypt. Documents reveal that they tended to live with their masters and could be sold and separated from their parents when they were just two years old. In one letter, a man encourages his brother to sell the youngest slave children and some wine, while promising to spoil his nephews. It reads: ‘…I am sending you some melon seeds and two bundles of old clothes, which you can share with your children.’ Few records document the lives of very young children, but it seems that they began doing light work between the ages of seven and nine when they may have looked after goats and collected wood or animal dung for fuel. There were probably a good number of children who did not live with their biological parents, because the mortality rate was high. Dr Vuolanto said: ‘It's like putting together a jigsaw puzzle. By examining papyri, pottery fragments with writing on toys and other objects, we are trying to form a picture of how children lived in Roman Egypt.’ The researchers have created a blog detailing translations and findings of the papyri as they are studied. One particular papyri - pictured above, right - sheds light on living conditions and housing in Oxyrhynchos. In the document, Aurelius is writing to petition the local police magistrate complaining that he has been treated with insolence and assaulted by a woman named Didyme, the wife of Agathos Daimon the cook, when staying in his home. It seems from this petition that Didyme came in, insulted and physically struck him, and then shouted at his daughter’s sons. In a blog post, the researchers say that the document raises lots of questions, such as how common it was for grandparents to raise children and where the parents were. The translation is as follows: . ‘To Aurelius Alexander, of the police magistrates, from Aurelius A[---] alias Aphynchis, former exhibitor of games in the city of the Oxyrhynchites. 'Yesterday evening a certain Didyme, the wife of Agathos Daimon, the cook, passing my house and finding me standing there with our family, treated us with insolence, using speakable and unspeakable expressions - a woman abundantly furnished with the utmost shamelessness and effrontery. 'Thereupon, when I stopped her, advising her to keep off from us, she leapt upon me, and, being distracted in her senses, even stretched out her hands and smote me, and railed furiously at some of my daughter's sons, whom I called to witness, and not only at them, but even at one of the officials of our city who was present. 'Having suffered so much, I, the victim of the assault, deliver to you this petition, asking you to give orders that she shall be brought before you, so that I may experience your beneficence toward all men. Farewell.'","Experts from the University of Oslo and the University of Newcastle are studying papyri to learn more about childhood in Roman times .

"A private plane which crashed nose-first into the ground at a London airport was at the centre of an investigation by air accident officials today. Emergency services were called to Biggin Hill Airport last night after the twin-engined jet carrying two crew members and four passengers left the runway while preparing for departure, causing its nose gear to collapse in the soft ground. Photographs taken at the scene showed the plane's nose had come off in the incident, and the aircraft was wedged into the muddy grass at the edge of the runway. Dramatic: This jet crashed nose-first next to the runway at London's Biggin Hill airport last night . Witnesses described seeing emergency vehicles surrounding the Gulfstream G1159-A on the runway while smoke poured out of it at around 8.30pm. The London Ambulance Service said eight people had been assessed by medics and a woman in her 30s was taken to hospital with minor injuries. It is believed she had hurt her ankle and she was taken to the Princess Royal Hospital in Farnborough for further treatment. However, a spokesman for the airport said the two crew members and four passengers were unhurt but were treated for shock at the scene. They were escorted from the aircraft by the airport's fire service. Airport Managing Director Will Curtis said: 'The incident was attended immediately by our airfield fire service and also by units from London Fire Brigade in accordance with our emergency incident planning procedures, but these were quickly stood down. 'We are very grateful to all emergency services for their ongoing cooperation and support.' Small scale: The accident happened at Biggin Hill airport (above) which is near Bromley, south east London . London Fire Brigade sent six fire engines to the airport in Bromley, south east London, with around 30 fire officers from Biggin Hill, Orpington, Addington and Bromley attending. The incident caused around five gallons of fuel to be spilled, and the firefighters were tasked with cleaning up the liquid. The Air Accident Investigation Branch confirmed today it has sent officers to examine the cause of the incident at the airport, which specialises in private aviation and flight instruction. A spokesman told MailOnline: 'The AAIB is investigating.' The jet was built in 1984 and is registered to the aviation firm World Heir Inc in Atlanta, Georgia, according to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. The firm declined to comment or say whether the plane was being leased. A representative said: 'I have no comment at this time. The investigation's ongoing. 'It was a situation where the plane departed the runway while taxiing for takeoff and no one was seriously injured.' LAS officer Chris Hawswell tweeted: 'We have attended a private passenger jet that was involved in an accident on takeoff. 'In total we have assessed 8 persons that were on board and are taking a woman to hospital with minor injuries. 'We activated a number of resources as a pre-determined attendance, most were cancelled before arriving.'","Woman in her 30s had to be taken to hospital after incident at Biggin Hill .

"Apple was mocked following the launch of its large-screen iPhone 6 and 6 Plus phones, with some critics accusing the firm of playing catch-up with the likes of Samsung and HTC. And now the firm’s own co-founder Steve Wozniak appears to have sided with these critics, saying Apple should have released a larger, phablet-style much sooner. If it had, continued Mr Wozniak in an interview with CNNMoney, the tech giant would have been able to steal a larger portion of the smartphone market from its rivals over the past three years. Scroll down for video . Apple’s 64-year-old co-founder Steve Wozniak (pictured) told CNNMoney the tech giant may have lost market share by not releasing a larger phone three years ago, to 'compete with Samsung better' The 64-year-old said: ‘Tech is like a song. You can get all the details from someone else, but you're not sure you like it until you hear it for yourself.’ Mr Wozniak co-founded Apple with Steve Jobs during the 1970s, and was responsible for designing the Apple I computer. He left the company in 1987. Apple’s 4.7-inch iPhone 6 and the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus were the first devices to break away from the firm's typical 4-inch displays on previous handsets. They were unveiled at the Flint Center for the Performing Arts at De Anza College in Cupertino in September.

"David Cameron today faced calls to use a meeting with the Emir of Qatar to call for an end to funding being handed to terrorists including ISIS. The Prime Minister is expected to meet with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani this week, for talks on economic investment in Britain. But critics want pressure to be put on Qatar to stop the flow of money between rich donors and extremists threatening countries around the world. Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, the Emir of Qatar, is expected to visit London this week to promote economic investment in Britain . It is thought the talks will be held in Downing Street on Wednesday or Thursday. In August Qatar denied supporting ISIS militants, insisting that 'determined, collective action' was needed to end sectarian violence in Iraq and Syria. And today officials including Qatar's director of intelligence told the BBC that the country only supported moderate rebel groups in Syria and 'had nothing to hide'. But this week a US government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Washington believes Turkey is partnering with Qatar in providing support to Islamist factions and militias in Libya. Tory MP Stephen Barclay told the Sunday Telegraph: 'It remains unclear whether money is still flowing from Qatari nationals. 'There is clear evidence that Qatari nationals have been instrumental in the financing of Sunni terror groups and the Prime Minister should not avoid tackling this issue head on with the Emir.' Former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said the meeting was a 'perfect opportunity' to tell the Qataris they could no longer 'run with the hare and hunt with the hounds'. Prime Minister David Cameron is facing calls to challenge the Emir over the flow of funding to ISIS from wealthy Qataris . Foreign Office minister Baroness Jay said this week that ISIS's main sources of revenue come from oil sales and extortion. But other sources have included foreign donors, kidnap ransom payments, and money stolen during its advances in recent months. She added: 'We are working with countries in the Middle East to counter the threat from terrorists and extremists across the region. Combating ISIL and degrading its financial support is a priority and we continue to discuss these issues with our partners, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar. 'We are working closely with all our international partners to intensify efforts to stem ISIL's funding flows.'","Prime Minister due to meet Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani this week .

"A Pakistani teenager awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts to promote girls' education brought her passion for learning to Philadelphia, where she received the Liberty Medal on Tuesday. In accepting the honor, Malala Yousafzai implored world leaders to spend money on supporting learning, not wars, and to solve their differences with words. 'Education is the best weapon against poverty, ignorance and terrorism,' she said. Scroll down for video . Malala Yousafzai holds up her Liberty Medal during a ceremony at the National Constitution Center, Tuesday,  in Philadelphia . Many honors: Yousafzai, 17, recently became the world's youngest Nobel laureate. Organizers of the Liberty Medal ceremony didn't know that would be the case when they decided months ago to honor her . Yousafzai, 17, recently became the world's youngest Nobel laureate. Organizers of the Liberty Medal ceremony didn't know that would be the case when they decided months ago to honor her. But the coincidence might have been expected: She has become the seventh medal recipient to subsequently receive the Nobel Peace Prize. The medal is given annually at the National Constitution Center to someone who strives to secure freedom for people around the world. Tuesday's ceremony included speeches from women with powerful stories about education, including Minnijean Brown Trickey, who helped integrate an Arkansas high school in 1957, and University of Pennsylvania president Amy Gutmann, a first-generation college student who rose to lead an Ivy League school. Gutmann, also a board member of the Constitution Center, praised Yousafzai for her 'compelling vision and immense courage.' 'An educated mind is the most powerful force for good on our planet,' Gutmann said. Huge honor: Malala Yousafzai puts on her Liberty Medal. She is the seventh winner who's also been named the year's Nobel laureate .

The medal is given annually at the National Constitution Center to someone who strives to secure freedom for people around the world. Yousafzai began her activism six years ago by using an alias to write for the BBC about living under Taliban rule. In 2012, a Taliban gunman shot her in the head while she was returning from school because of her vocal support for gender equality and education for girls. She ended up being treated for her injury in Britain, where she recovered and now lives with her family. She attends a high school for girls but continues activism on those issues through speaking engagements, a best-selling book and a nonprofit organization called the Malala Fund. Yousafzai said Tuesday that when the Taliban went to Pakistan's Swat Valley, where she lived with her family, she had two options: not speak and wait to be killed or speak and then be killed. 'Why should I not speak?' she said. 'It is our duty.' Modest: Malala Yousafzai waves as she arrives on stage before receiving the Liberty Medal . Among giants: Little Rock Nine member Minnijean Brown Trickey speaks during the Liberty Medal ceremony . She said the Taliban 'made a big mistake' trying to silence her. The day she was shot, she said, 'Weakness, fear and hopelessness died, and strength, power and courage were born.' Her appearance in Philadelphia came less than two weeks after she became the youngest Nobel laureate, sharing the prize with Kailash Satyarthi, a children's rights activist from India. The Liberty Medal comes with a $100,000 award, which Yousafzai said she'll spend in Pakistan on children who need education and other support. Previous recipients of the Liberty Medal who went on to win the Peace Prize include former South African President Nelson Mandela, former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and former President Jimmy Carter. The National Constitution Center is dedicated to increasing public understanding of the Constitution and the ideas and values it represents.","The medal is given annually at the National Constitution Center to someone who strives to secure freedom for people around the world .

"Far right nationalist supporters of the Ukrainian Freedom Party held violent protests outside the nation's parliament building in Kiev to force legislators to recognise a World War II paramilitary force who fought both the Nazis and Soviet Union. Protesters threw stones and bottles at police guarding the nation's parliament building from attack. Young men armed with batons and metal chains gathered outside the building from early morning, breaking dozens of windows. Proceedings in the parliament building concluded early as a result of the disorder, although deputies managed some anti-corruption legislation in advance of parliamentary elections on October 26. Scroll down for video . Massed ranks of riot police tried to protect the parliament building as delegates voted on a range of anti-corruption legislation . One masked protester angrily swung a large length of heavy chain, hitting riot police with the medieval-style weapon . Members of the Ukrainian Freedom Party gathered in Kiev to celebrate the Day of Ukrainian Cossacks on Independence Square . However, some of the protesters covered their faces with balaclavas during the march which soon turned violent . Zoryan Shkiryak, aid to the Ukrainian interior minster said: 'This is a provocative action directed on destabilisation of the situation in Ukraine.' Members of the nationalist Svoboda party held a rally near the parliament building asking for special status to be granted to the World War II nationalist force called the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA). The Svoboda party denied its people were responsible for the violence. Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko managed to pass laws creating an anti-corruption bureau to fight graft as well as new restrictions to counter money laundering. Parliament also approved a new defense minister — former National Guard head Stepan Poltorak — a pressing priority as Ukraine still faces daily clashes with pro-Russian separatists in its industrial eastern regions. A cease-fire has been in place since early September but violations are reported daily. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said Tuesday their positions had come under rocket fire more than 30 times in the last 24 hours. Security spokesman Col. Andrei Lysenko said seven servicemen in the east had been killed over the same time period, six of them by mines. Much of the fighting in the east has focused on the government-held airport in the main rebel-held city of Donetsk. A rebel commander leading that assault, who identifies himself only by the nom de guerre Givi, said 27 of his fighters have been killed in the last three weeks while fighting for the airport.

"A German jihadist who was caught with watches from Aldi, chocolate and novels for ISIS extremists will face trial next week. Former KFC worker Ismail Issa, 24, was arrested by authorities in Stuttgart, Germany, when he was found running errands to buy supplies for comrades in Syria. This included watches from the budget supermarket chain, medicine and night-vision gear. Ismail Issa was arrested in Germany after he was caught running errands for his ISIS comrades in Syria . Issa, born in Lebanon, was radicalised in Stuttgart and initially went to Syria to fight for the overthrow of the Assad regime. He later joined the ranks of ISIS who gave him a wish-list of items to buy for them during a return to the city. They wanted four sports watches from Aldi costing €28 each, 10 pairs of combat trousers from an online US Army shop at €189.90 each and night-vision gear from a Stuttgart hunting shop costing more than 4,000 euros. Chocolate, medicine and novels were also on the wish-list. Officers from the German intelligence service, the BND, monitored him upon his return to Germany following an anonymous tip-off. He was travelling in a car through Europe back to Syria in November last year when police pulled him over at an autobahn service station and found his shopping. He still had his ISIS shopping list with the names of ten comrades and their waist and leg measurements. The items on the extremists' wish-list for Issa included four sports watches from Aldi supermarket . Mohammed Sobhan, a 28-year-old Afghani was arrested with him, who police say was recruited by Issa. Both men and Issa's brother Ezzedine, 33, go on trial on November 5 charged with supporting terrorism. The indictment against all three is 81 pages long and has many details about Issa's radicalisation as well as the structures and organisation of ISIS. It says how he was raised with five siblings by his mother and had a chaotic upbringing. He left school at 17, held temporary jobs and married his girlfriend who was pregnant and moved to Sweden. The couple split when the pregnancy failed and by 2010, Issa returned to his mother in Stuttgart and began working at a KFC. He tried to return to school, but instead turned to drugs and soon became radicalised in Stuttgart. In late 2012, he flew to Syria and ended up joining the ranks of ISIS but after he was wounded in battle and deemed a 'little bit useless', he returned to Germany to pick up the supplies. In Germany, more than 450 people have left the country for Syria since the fighting began and about 130 have returned, security officials said. About 25 are believed to have battlefield experience. Prosecutors said they had begun more than 140 investigations related to Islamic extremism, often involving more than one suspect. Under German law, no pleas are entered until trial. Issa has been held in a state prison since his arrest. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison, the maximum under German law.","Ismail Issa, 24, was arrested by authorities in Stuttgart, Germany .

"Activists have asked authorities to let them know early if a white police officer will face charges for shooting dead black teenager Michael Brown, so they can try to stop violence when the news breaks. Protests have rolled through the streets in the Missouri town of Ferguson since Brown was shot on August 9, as the killing became a flashpoint for race relations in the United States. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, rioting and looting have broken out occasionally. The Don't Shoot Coalition on Wednesday asked for 48 hours' advance notice of a pending grand jury decision on whether Officer Darren Wilson will face charges for shooting Brown, saying it would help prevent widespread violence. A makeshift shrine made of stuffed animal toys has emerged on the site where 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot dead by a Missouri police officer on August 9 in Ferguson, Missouri. Members of the coalition said at a news conference they want to 'de-escalate violence without de-escalating action' once a grand jury decides whether to indict Officer Darren Wilson, who is white, for shooting Brown. The coalition represents more than 50 organizations including union workers, clergy, anti-war activists and black empowerment groups. Its members are leaders of the protests that erupted across the region after Brown's death and have continued in the three months since. 'Everyone around the United States and much of the world is looking at St. Louis,' said Michael McPhearson, executive director of Veterans for Peace. 'There's much anticipation as to what happens next.' Demonstrators on Wednesday criticized the use of tear gas, riot equipment and armored vehicles by county and local police in the early days of the protests. The heavy initial response led Gov. Jay Nixon to summon the National Guard and temporarily put the Missouri Highway Patrol in charge of Ferguson crowd control. Anger at Brown's shooting erupted into violence protests in Ferguson in August, where marked demonstrators clashed with police firing tear gas and using armored vehicles . At one point, the violence prompted Missouri Governor Jay Nixon to call out the National Guard and put the state highway patrol in charge of crowd control . Authorities were criticised for being heavy-handed in their initial response to the protests. The case has become a flashpoint for race relations in the United States . Ed Magee, a spokesman for St. Louis County Attorney Bob McCulloch, who is overseeing the grand jury investigation, met with McPhearson and attorney Denise Lieberman earlier Wednesday and said the coalition's request for 48 hours' notice of a grand jury decision is 'being considered.' The grand jury was expected to hear evidence in Brown's case until mid-November, but McCulloch has said its work could continue for several more weeks. Brown was unarmed when Officer Wilson encountered him walking in the street with a friend. A scuffle ensued and Brown was shot multiple times. Witness accounts of what happened varied. Police have said Brown, who was 6ft 4ins and 300lbs, was killed after Wilson told the teenager and his friend to move out of the street and onto a sidewalk. They claim the victim was trying to go for Wilson's gun. But witnesses, including the friend, told the press Brown had his hands up and was surrendering when he was gunned down. 'After the verdict, no matter what it is, people are going to pour into the street — either in celebration or in rage,' said Montague Simmons, chairman of the Organization for Black Struggle. 'It's in the best interest of the public, the police and elected officials who control the actions of the police to work together to protect the rights of people to engage in civil disobedience and expression of their First Amendment rights of free speech and assembly.' Organizers have created 19 'rules of engagement' they want police to follow, including calls to treat protesters as 'citizens and not enemy combatants.' County police Chief Jon Belmar said earlier this week police do not intend to impede peaceful dissent but said he wouldn't take anything off the table when asked about the use of tear gas and other tactics. 'I have a responsibility...to make sure that everybody walks out of this on the other end,' he said. Brown's parents, Michael Brown Sr and Lesley McSpadden, have launched a campaign for justice and to improve race relations in the United States and elsewhere. They are due to speak at a United Nations human rights conference in Switzerland next week. Brown (left) was gunned down by white officer Darren Wilson (right) in the St Louis suburb of Ferguson.

"The World Cup, and Michael Schumacher's battle to recover from a brain injury following a skiing accident in 2013 have been the most searched for topics of the year. These terms beat searches for the launch of the new iPhone, and the trial of Oscar Pistorius, according to search engine Yahoo. The internet company analysed billions of searches made using Yahoo during 2014 to produce a report on the issues that most captured the British public's imagination. Scroll down for video . Germany's high scoring performances on the national side's march to victory at the World Cup in Brazil helped to make the competition the most searched term in 2014 by users of Yahoo . In its annual Year in Review, Yahoo said the World Cup - with its record goals and the now notorious biting incident involving Luis Suarez - was the most searched for topic. The World Cup gained a fifth more searches than those looking for updates throughout the year on Michael Schumacher's medical struggle. The retired F1 driver suffered horrific brain injuries in a skiing accident at the end of 2013. Surprisingly, given the hype that surrounds Apple's devices and the clamour to get hold of one, the launch of the new iPhone 6 was in third place, with the fortunes of Manchester United in fourth. Apple's iPhone 6 was the most searched technology term but failed to capture the public's imagination in the same way as other major news stories . Major news stories such as the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, the trial of Oscar Pistorius and the spread of Ebola in Africa also made the top 20 list. Peaches Geldof, Madeleine McCann, Robin Williams, the Scottish Referendum, Rolf Harris, Ebola and Rik Mayall also featured. However, perhaps the most surprising trend was in celebrity searches, where Good Morning Britain presenter Susanna Reid, 44, beat the likes of Kim Kardashian, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and Miley Cyrus to top the list of celebrity searches. Despite tumbling ratings on the ITV show, the former BBC Breakfast presenter did not even feature in the top 20 searches last year, but has grown in fame after reaching the 2013 final of Strictly Come Dancing. Jennifer Lawrence, who was among dozens of celebrities to fall victim to hackers that managed gain access to intimate pictures stored on Apple's iCloud, was the second most searched celebrity while One Direction, Beyonce and Jay-Z and Holly Willoughby also made the top 10. Yahoo is Britain's third most popular search engine, accounting for around three per cent of the market behind Google and Microsoft's Bing. Yahoo also compiled a list of 'obsessions', which was again topped by the World Cup, just ahead of Apple's iPhone 6 and Disney's film Frozen. Loom Bands and the Ice Bucket Challenge also obsessed the British public. Yet, many people were also perplexed by the ALS and the challenge, making the question 'What is the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge?' among the most asked questions on Yahoo. The most commonly asked question was how to make Loom Bands, followed by those who couldn't work out when Easter and Mother's Day was. In eighth place curious Eastender's fans hoping that Yahoo might know something about the plot that they did not, asked: 'Who killed Lucy Beale?' Her killer is expected to be unmasked in a special episode in February 2015. Seven-time Forumla One champion Michael Schumacher's battle for life has transfixed fans around the world after his skiing accident in 2013. Searches for updates about his condition made him the second most searched topic on Yahoo as the public tried to get news about his health and the care he has been receiving . Disney's heartwarming story Frozen earned itself two Oscars for best animated feature, and song with Let It Go earlier this year, helping to win it a place in the most searched topics on the internet . Luis Suarez was the most searched for sporting star, ahead of Cristiano Ronaldo, Andy Murray and Rory McIlroy, mainly due to his ban for biting in the World Cup and his transfer to Barcelona. The political agenda was dominated by the Scottish referendum on independence and the rise of Ukip, which occupy first and second respectively on the politics search list. Ukip leader Nigel Farage was the fourth most searched for political figure, with former Scotland first minister Alex Salmond third. Mr Salmond's successor Nicola Sturgeon, and Russian president Vladimir Putin were also among the top 10. However, perhaps the most surprising trend was in celebrity searches, where Good Morning Britain presenter Susanna Reid, 44, (pictured) beat the likes of Kim Kardashian, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and Miley Cyrus to top the list of celebrity searches . Luis Suarez (right) found himself on the receiving end of football fan's disgust and ridicule after he was accused of biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini during a World Cup match between Italy and Uruguay . Apple dominated the technology searches, making up half of the top 10 with the iPhone 6 at the top of the list, but the firm's new Apple Watch and iPad Air also making an appearance. Sony's Playstation 4 games console was second on the list, with the Samsung Galaxy S5 in third.

"A pregnant journalist was recovering in hospital last night after a pro-Kremlin political leader in Russia told two male aides to ‘violently rape’ her. Nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky launched his extraordinary tirade after reporter Stella Dubovitskaya asked him an innocuous question about sanctions against Ukraine. The 67-year-old MP’s outburst came before a deadly gunfight at a Ukraine checkpoint controlled by pro-Russian separatists tore apart an Easter truce. Scroll down for video . Vladimir Zhironovsky launched an extraordinary rant at journalist Stella Dubovitskaya (pictured right in a light-coloured shirt) at a press conference today - telling two male aides to 'violently' rape her . Zhirinovsky turns to shout at the journalist, who is six months pregnant, after she asks him about sanctions against Ukraine . The attack raised tensions and led separatists to call for Russian military intervention to protect civilians . Moscow . and local militia claimed five people were killed in the firefight at . around 1am yesterday near Slavyansk, blaming a far-right group for the . attack. ‘The Easter truce has been violated,’ the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement. ‘This provocation…testifies to the lack of will on the part of the Kiev authorities to rein in and disarm extremists.’ The politician approaches the female reporter - gesticulating at her wildly. He then told her: 'This is no place for you if you're pregnant' But Ukraine has accused Moscow of a ‘cynical provocation’ staged by outside forces. Yesterday . Pope Francis prayed in his Easter message that God would ‘enlighten and . inspire the initiatives that promote peace in Ukraine, so that all . those involved…will make every effort to prevent violence’. The . fatal assault was the first serious violence since last week’s signing . of a proposed peace plan between Russia, Ukraine, the US and the . European Union. The deal requires illegal military groups to disband and for gangs to leave seized buildings. Two of Zhirinovsky's aides then approach the woman, following his commands. One grabs the pregnant reporter while others jump to her defence . It . was rejected by separatist leaders, who still occupy police stations . and government offices in at least ten cities. Ukraine’s interim prime . minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk has accused Russian president Vladimir Putin . of trying to ‘restore the Soviet Union.’ He said that if Putin succeeded . it would be ‘the biggest disaster of this century’. In . Moscow, Zhirinovsky’s conduct towards the pregnant reporter has been . referred to the Russian parliament’s ethics commission and he faces . legal action from Miss Dubovitskaya’s employer, news agency Russia . Today. One of the man's aides turns to look at Zhirinovsky - who then calls one of the reporter's defenders an 'interfering lesbian.' Stella Dubovitskaya is now in hospital following her ordeal . ‘Due to the . disgusting incident in the state duma, after which our correspondent was . hospitalised because of Vladimir Zhirinovsky’s discourtesy, we have . decided to use all legal options to punish Mr Zhirinovsky as severely as . possible under the law, including by suing him,’ said general director . Margareta Simonyan. After . Miss Dubovitskaya’s question, the founder of the far right Liberal . Democratic Party began shouting before manhandling two young male aides . towards the pregnant mother-of-one. He then shouted to them: ‘When I say, you run to her and violently rape her.’ Zhirinovsky apologised for his actions during a live interview on Russian television this evening . The man said: 'When talking to the press in the Duma on Friday, answering questions at the end, I spoke a bit rudely when I replied to a young woman. I offer my apologies to her and to everyone, if I happened to offend someone' A . male journalist told Zhirinovsky: ‘She is pregnant, why are you . attacking her?’ Zhirinovsky then pushed two aides towards the . journalist, who is six months pregnant, shouting: ‘Go and kiss her. Grab . her.’ One physically touched Miss Dubovitskaya, to the shock of the watching press, with several female reporters recoiling. The gun battle was evidence that Ukraine is not reining in gun-wielding far right extremists, Russia claimed . The attack shows that the Ukrainian authorities are failing to rein in armed extremists, Russia's foreign ministry said today . At . this point, another female reporter,  Yulia Chuchalova from news agency . Interfax, told Zhirinovsky: ‘This is derogatory, humiliating – what are . you doing here?’ Zhirinovsky hit back: ‘What are you doing intervening . here, you lesbian? Get out of here.’ He . shouted: ‘This is no place for you if you’re pregnant. We need healthy . people. Pregnant women should not show up at work. Sit at home and look . after your child, got that?’ He then shouted ‘get out of here, you damned lesbians’.

"A mum who ballooned to a size 26 with a steady diet of fast food and crisps is launching her modelling career after shedding six stone in just five months. Mallorie Goodwin, from Wetherby, West Yorkshire, topped out at 15st as she struggled to control her weight and poor eating habits for much of her life, but has shifted the bulge after committing to a rigid diet. Now a healthy 9st 5lb, the 39-year-old 'yummy mummy' has the size eight body she has always dreamed of and has even been contacted by a modelling agency. Scroll down for video . Mallorie Goodwin dropped from 15st (left) to 9st 5lb (right) in just five months . The svelte mum-of-two said: 'It's a dream come true. I have now got the figure I always wanted and I feel so much more confident in myself - to have a modelling agency want me is just the cherry on top. 'Now when I go out with my husband Anthony people think I'm his daughter. I'm so happy to have a figure I always wanted - I'm just getting used to it. 'I have a wardrobe bursting with clothes and I can't wait to show my outfits off. Before I hated my picture taken but now I love it.' Her weight problems began as a child when she was served huge portions of hearty meals such as cottage pie. Before: The mum-of-two lived on a steady diet of fast food and crisps as she gained more weight . At the age of six, her parents would exclude her from fish and chips dinners because she was overweight. Mallorie said: 'I was always conscious that my weight was a problem from a very young age. 'We would eat very large portions at home and I grew up in the era when you would finish everything on your plate. 'My mother was told by my primary school teacher that I was always asking for seconds.' She shed the puppy fat in secondary school but with access to junk food like pizza and crisps as she grew older, the weight soon came back. 'I knew I was getting bigger and I had a double chin which I hated. I would very rarely have my picture taken.' She was able to munch through 15 bags of crisps in an evening and kept piling on the weight – and losing confidence – as she grew older. Fat fighter: Mallorie says she was able to munch through 15 bags of crisps in an evening . Things took a turn for the worse when, in her 20s, she was a size 14 and her boyfriend at the time told her he always dated slimmer girls who were a size eight. Mallorie said: 'My confidence was non-existent. I knew I should have been a size ten but I was living a party lifestyle, going out drinking and having curries at 1am. 'I would then wake up and have a full fry up and pick on junk food throughout the day.' Later, after Mallorie had her two children, Dylan, 9, and Pippa, 7, she struggled with health issues, including fatigue and back pain. After going back and forth to doctors' appointments for five years, she was diagnosed with an underactive thyroid. It was at the doctors that she finally weighed herself and realised the scales were reading 15st. It served as a wake-up call and she prepared herself for the fight of life. Mallorie said: 'I was gobsmacked. I had accepted that I was about 13 stone but to see 15 was a complete shock. Breakfast: Fry up . Lunch: Two Big Mac meals from McDonald's . Snacks: Crisps . Dinner: Pizza, Chinese, curry, roast dinners or cottage pie . Breakfast: CWP shake, poached eggs, or porridge with skimmed milk . Lunch: CWP soup . Dinner: Chicken and veg, fish and veg . Snacks: CWP, lemon bar, nuts, fruit, yoghurt . 'I had a battle with my health and not feeling well since I had my children and to finally find out what was wrong gave me the confidence to lose the weight. 'Once I started my medication and my health improved I realised I was left with this fat body which I didn't want. 'The doctor told me that if I didn't lose weight I was at risk of developing diabetes - it was a real wake-up call.' Mallorie started the Cambridge Weight Plan in November of last year and lost a staggering five stone 10lb in just five months. She said: 'I cut out the junk and lost seven pounds on my own but it wasn't enough. Cambridge Weight Plan was perfect for me - after two weeks on the soups and shakes I didn't feel hungry at all and the support I received was amazing.' After: Mallorie with husband Anthony and their two children - Dylan, 9, and Pippa, 7 . Mallorie even sent in her picture to a modelling agency after being encouraged by a stylist on a Cambridge Weight Plan shoot. She was stunned when the agency said they wanted to represent her. She said: 'I'm so excited about the thought of modelling. When I was a size 26 I never dreamed I would be happy having my photo taken - now I can't wait to get in front of the camera and try my hand at modelling. 'I have been on photo shoots for Cambridge Weight Plan and on one the stylist said to me that as I should look into doing modelling because she thought I would be really good. 'Never in a million years did I dream I would be starting a modelling career at 39. 'I'm so excited, my husband was a bit worried but I've told him I'm not going to go off with anyone else.' Mallorie has become a Cambridge Weight Plan consultant, using her experience of being overweight to help others. 'I've been there so I know how hard it is and how lonely it can feel. 'I get a lot of compliments from other mums or women asking to help them, which I can't wait to do. 'My life has changed for the better and my husband and children are so proud of me and love how happy and content I am and now I just want to give something back.'","Mallorie Goodwin decided to make a significant change after weighing 15st .

"Paul Scholes fears Danny Welbeck could come back to haunt Manchester United  on Saturday. The Arsenal and England star was deemed surplus to requirements by Louis van Gaal in the summer and sold to their Premier League rivals. United could leapfrog the Gunners in the table with victory at Old Trafford, but former Red Devil Scholes fears the worst. Danny Welbeck has enjoyed a storming start to the season for his new club and country . Welbeck has scored 10 goals in 21 games so far this campaign for Arsenal and England . 'In terms of United, they miss the energy that Danny once gave them in attack,' Scholes said in the Evening Standard. 'My view has not changed: he should not have been sold and recently I have felt that United have looked a bit pedestrian going forward. As a United fan I am a little concerned for them going into Saturday’s game. 'Aside from Michael Carrick at his very best, United lack a central midfielder capable of linking play and getting the best out of their forwards. Welbeck will come up against former Old Trafford team-mate Wayne Rooney at the weekend . 'They need that individual who can pass the ball forward, play one-twos and bring the strikers into the game. That kind of playmaker – a Cesc Fabregas, Luka Modric or Toni Kroos – is vital to any side. They are the brains of the team and without them the forwards can struggle. 'Much will be made of Danny Welbeck’s first game against the club at which he grew up. The immediate assumption will be that Danny is nurturing some grievance against United at being sold and will want to prove a point. 'I don’t see it that way. Danny will want to play well because he would want to anyway, regardless of the opposition, and from what I see and hear he is very happy at Arsenal and with his move to London.'

"In the wake of the Westminster child abuse scandal and allegations of establishment cover-ups, hackers Anonymous have decided to expose international paedophile networks. The hacking group says it is is planning on collecting evidence against international paedophile rings and their abuse of children to find the links between different operations and ultimately bring the perpetrators to justice. Named 'Operation Death Eaters' after Voldemort's band of evil followers in the Harry Potter series, the group is calling for a global effort in exposing the paedophile rings through the power of social media. Scroll down for video . A still from the Operation Death Eaters video by  Anonymous - the hacking group says it is is planning on collecting evidence against international paedophile rings to ultimately bring the perpetrators to justice . This newest Anonymous campaign comes just weeks after the group declared war on jihadists in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris. Now, they are building a grassroots database of paedophile cases from across the world in order to ultimately expose an 'international cult' of child sex abuse. A Tumblr set up to promote the campaign states: 'The objective of opdeatheaters is an independent, international, victim-led tribunal/ inquiry into trafficking and paedosadist industry. 'What is our first step? We need meticulously researched and clearly documented examples of high level complicity in the industry, obstruction of justice and coverups to show the need for independent inquiries.' The UK version of the site states: 'The CSA inquiry in the UK is an attempt to depict a powerful cult as a string of isolated incidents of ""sex abuse"". 'The complicit UK media is running a huge propaganda campaign to conflate torture and murder with ""paedophilia"" and call for understanding of ""paedophilia"". 'This is not a group of sad paedophiles who need help and understanding. This is a torture and death cult with a powerful global human trafficking network. Named 'Operation Death Eaters' after Voldemort's band of evil followers in the Harry Potter series, the group is calling for a global effort in exposing the paedophile rings through the power of social media . 'We demand that torture and murder be called torture and murder, not sex. This is an international cult and needs to be investigated as one, not simply as an endless series of isolated incidents confined to the UK. 'We call upon our comrades globally to help us investigate and demand an end to to the trafficking networks with arrests at the top not just the bottom. 'We demand an end to human trafficking and abuse complicity worldwide.' The Independent refers to an Anonymous statement which claims: 'The Westminster paedophile ring is one of many cases where Operation DeathEaters has actively pursued and sought truth, in order to end the hideous crimes concealed behind the British elite. 'In fear of these investigations being bungled over time, the operation’s objectives are clear and simple: source public information before it disappears, push for independent enquiry, and offer support to witnesses and the victims where needed.' Anonymous also cites a number of high profile cases and investigations in the UK including Jimmy Savile, MP Cyril Smith,the claims regarding Elm Guest House and the now-defunct Paedophile International Exchange . Tens of millions of images of child abuse are believed to be circulating online on the 'dark web', many showing such graphic abuse  that the media is turning a blind eye to the problem, experts warned this week. Figures from the European Commission's Global Alliance against Child Sexual Abuse Online suggest 50,000 new child abuse images are uploaded each year - of which more than 70 per cent are images of children under the age of 10. Heather Marsh, author of Binding Chaos and who works with Anonymous, said: 'Our central objective is to establish independent, internationally linked, victim-led inquiries into high level complicity, obstruction of justice and cover-ups in the paedosadism and child trafficking industries. 'The premise behind OpDeathEaters is to expose high level complicity, obstruction of justice and cover up in the paedosadist industry in order to show the need for independent inquiries.' On January 10 Anonymous activists released a video condemning the gun attack at French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo which left 12 people dead. The hacking group says it wants to collect evidence against international paedophile rings and look into their abuse of children to find the links between different operations and bring the perpetrators to justice . In the clip, which was uploaded to the group's Belgian YouTube account, a figure wearing the group's Guy Fawkes mask and a hood says in French in an electronically-distorted voice: 'We are declaring war against you, the terrorists.' Sitting at a desk and reading from a piece of paper, the figure says the group will track down and close all accounts on social networks related to terrorists to avenge those killed. Anonymous has previously carried out cyber attacks on websites belonging to the Government, as well as those of corporate and religious organisations. In 2012 Anonymous crippled the Home Office's website by flooding it with huge amounts of internet traffic. Hacker group Anonymous has been linked to online attacks around the world aimed at punishing governments for policies of which the hackers disapprove. Members are known as 'Anons' and are distinguished by their Guy Fawkes masks. The group are seen as anything from digital Robin Hoods to cyber terrorists for their hacking campaigns against government agencies, child pornography sites and the Klu Klux Klan. In 2008 the online community staged a series of protests, pranks, and hacks Church of Scientology as part if its 'Project Chanology.' Later targets of Anonymous 'hacktivism' included government agencies of the US, Israel, Tunisia, Uganda, and others, copyright protection agencies; the Westboro Baptist Church; and corporations such as PayPal, MasterCard, Visa, and Sony. In 2013 they declared war on secretive 'chat sites' used by paedophiles to trade images. Last November they hacked into the Twitter account of the Ku Klux Klan after the white supremacist group distributed flyers threatening 'lethal force' protesters in Ferguson. Dozens of people have been arrested for involvement in Anonymous cyberattacks, in countries including the US, UK, Australia, the Netherlands, Spain, and Turkey.","Hacking group Anonymous are targeting international paedophile rings .

"The reporter who helped Edward Snowdon expose the National Security Agency’s top-secret surveillance programs has had secrets from his own checkered past uncovered. Glenn Greenwald, who now works for The Guardian newspaper, was previously a lawyer with connections to the porn industry. Greenwald has been thrust into the spotlight in the past month due to his role in breaking the story about the Obama administration’s widespread phone surveillance program. Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald has said the U.S. government should be careful in its pursuit of Snowden . Greenwald, 46, is a native of Queens, New York who graduated from NYU in 1995 as a lawyer. In 2002 he started his own practice Master Notions Inc, which according to records had a client known as HJ - short for ‘Hairy Jocks’ - that was involved in the porn industry. The New York Daily News reports that Greenwald and his business partner Jason Buchtel agreed to help HJ owner Peter Haas in exchange for 50 percent of the company’s profits. That relationship soured quickly and after only two months of working together, Haas refused to pay Greenwald and Buchtel their share of the profits. Checkered past: 'I'm 46 years old and, like most people, have lived a complicated and varied adult life,' wrote Greenwald . A nasty legal battle ensued in which Haas also accused Greenwald and Master Notions of taking his client list to market their own videos via 'hairystuds.com.' The case was settled in 2004 after Greenwald was able to contend that Haas didn’t have a real client list to steal, and that Master Notions had assembled its own by 'reviewing clubs, groups and chat rooms on the Internet and on America Online, which are geared toward those with an interest in adult videos.' Writing about the incident on the Guardian’s website on Wednesday, Greenwald wrote: 'The producer quickly settled the case by . paying some substantial portion of what was owed, and granting the LLC . the rights to use whatever it had obtained when consulting with him to . start its own competing business.' He also writes that he was bought out of the company by my partners not long after. Tense: NBC host David Gregory and journalist Glenn Greenwald had a tense moment when Gregory suggested Greenwald should be charged with a crime for 'aiding' NSA whistle-blower Edward Snowden . 'I’m 46 years old and, like most people, have lived a complicated and varied adult life,' Greenwald also wrote about his checkered past. 'I didn’t manage my life from the age of 18 onward with the intention of being a family values U.S. senator. My personal life, like pretty much everyone’s, is complex and sometimes messy.' NBC 'Meet the Press' host David Gregory got a rise out of Glenn Greenwald on Sunday by asking . the Guardian reporter why he shouldn't be charged with a crime for . having 'aided and abetted' Snowden. Greenwald replied that it was 'pretty extraordinary that anybody who would call . themselves a journalist would publicly muse about whether or not other . journalists should be charged with felonies.' Last Sunday Ecuador's foreign minister and the anti-secrecy . group WikiLeaks said Snowden was headed to Ecuador to seek asylum. He had fled . to Hong Kong last month ahead of leaking details about an NSA . surveillance program. He is now in the transit area of Sheremetyevo . Airport in Moscow. On the run: Edward Snowden is currently believed to be in the transit area of Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow . During . his interview with NBC's Gregory, Greenwald declined to discuss where . Snowden was headed. That refusal seemed to prompt Gregory to ask: 'To . the extent that you have aided and abetted Snowden, even in his current . movements, why shouldn't you, Mr. Greenwald, be charged with a crime?' Greenwald . said Gregory was embracing the Obama administration's attempt to 'criminalize investigative journalism,' citing an FBI agent's . characterization of Fox News journalist James Rosen as a probable . co-conspirator of a State Department contractor who was suspected of . leaking classified information to Rosen. Rosen was not charged. 'If . you want to embrace that theory, it means that every investigative . journalist in the United States who works with their sources, who . receives classified information is a criminal, and it's precisely those . theories and precisely that climate that has become so menacing in the . United States,' said Greenwald. Greenwald claims that 'distractions about my past and personal life' will not stop him from continuing to report on the NSA scandal . Gregory . responded that 'the question of who is a journalist may be up to a . debate with regard to what you are doing.' Gregory also said he was . merely asking a question. 'That question has . been raised by lawmakers as well,' Gregory said. 'I'm not embracing . anything, but, obviously, I take your point.' Later, . Greenwald tweeted, 'Who needs the government to try to criminalize . journalism when you have David Gregory to do it?'  and, 'Has David . Gregory ever publicly wondered if powerful DC officials should be . prosecuted for things like illegal spying & lying to Congress?' In his column on Wednesday, Greenwald . also write that 'distractions about my past and personal life' would not . stop him from pursuing his reporting on the NSA scandal. 'None of . that – or anything else – will detain me even for an instant in . continuing to report on what the NSA is doing in the dark,' he wrote.","Guardian reporter Glenn Greenwald's prior involvement in the porn industry has been uncovered .

"These days he prefers not to discuss his love of deerstalking. But David Cameron still treats pigeons as fair game – and has taken a 12-bore shotgun out to hunt them near his home, it has been claimed. The Prime Minister even asked Scotland Yard protection officers to seal off woodland in Oxfordshire while he took aim, according to a startling disclosure. Scroll down for video . David Cameron - pictured at the Heythrop Hunt in Chipping Norton in 2002 - has vowed to give MPs a free vote to scrap the hunting ban . The PM (left) is known to be a keen shooter but has become frustrated at not being able to go deer stalking . Mr Cameron was unable to go deer stalking when he went to the Scottish island of Jura last year . The Tory leader is said to have targeted pigeons because he ‘missed’ the days when he could shoot deer in Scotland. Last night animal rights groups reacted furiously to the claims, accusing the PM of killing animals for ‘sheer pleasure’. Mr Cameron is said to be an expert deerstalker and has spoken openly in the past about his fondness for country pursuits including foxhunting and shooting. But since becoming Prime Minister, he has been less keen to talk about his love of field sports. Yet when he was missing the days when he could go deerstalking at his father-in-law’s Scottish estate, he went out to shoot pigeons in the woods, according to the newly published diaries of The Telegraph’s Scottish Editor Alan Cochrane. Mr Cochrane, who met the Prime Minister for dinner in Fife in February 2012 during the long run-up to the independence referendum, wrote in his diary: ‘As we ate venison, DC moaned about the fact that he couldn’t go deerstalking any more. ‘I suppose he doesn’t want to hark back to the grouse moor-image days of Harold Macmillan, or to be seen out with a rifle. ‘DC says that recently he fancied a bit of shooting, so took his 12-bore out into a wood near his home and bagged a couple of pigeons. It must have been quite a sight – the wood had to be surrounded by coppers with guns. Whether that was to protect the ramblers from the PM or the PM from the ramblers wasn’t clear. ‘Anyway, he misses shooting/killing things.’ Prime Minister Harold MacMillan - the Earl of Stockton - was a famous Conservative hunter . The then Prime Minister was often pictured taking part in field sports - including  grouse shooting at Bolton Abbey . Asked if the Prime Minister owned a 12-bore shotgun, both Downing Street and Scotland Yard declined to comment. Andrew Tyler, of campaign group Animal Aid, said: ‘This is killing animals for the sheer pleasure of exterminating their lives. Normally these activities are wrapped up in justifications to do with conserving species, or boosting the rural economy, or species management. Head stalker Peter Fraser, prepares to load a freshly shot stag onto a pony at Milstone Cairn in Glen Callater on the Invercauld Estate . ‘What makes it all the more nauseating is that he hasn’t got the guts to do it openly, because he knows what the political fall-out would be. He is trying to distance himself from the “posh boy” image.’ Yesterday Mr Cameron’s neighbours in Oxfordshire said they had not seen the PM carrying a shotgun in woodland near his home. One woman, who asked not to be named, said: ‘I have never seen him with a gun under his arm. You do hear shots going off from time to time but I think that is mainly the organised shoots.’ Another neighbour added: ‘So what if he does?’ Political commentator Bruce Anderson has described Mr Cameron as an ‘excellent shot’. He said: ‘Shooting is a form of complete relaxation, and if you are Prime Minister, and want to switch off, it is perfect.’ The PM was a regular deerstalker – where stags are tracked and then shot – and is reputedly one of the few marksmen skilled enough to shoot two beasts in one go using the so-called ‘right left’ technique. He used to hunt at the 20,000-acre Tarbert estate on the Scottish island of Jura owned by his wife Samantha’s stepfather Viscount Astor. He insisted he had not given up the sport because of objections from animal rights campaigners, saying it was the most ‘defensible’ field sport because it kept the deer numbers under control. In a BBC radio interview before becoming PM, Mr Cameron revealed he was taught to shoot rabbits by his father and said he had ‘always been a country boy’. Last year, he dodged a question about hunting by saying he would now ‘rather go for a walk’. The Tories pledged to give the Commons a free vote on repealing Labour’s ban on foxhunting – which Mr Cameron also used to enjoy – but it was unofficially shelved in 2011.","Prime Minister went shooting in a wood near his Oxfordshire home .

"Brazilian midfielder Anderson was always first to show off his dancing skills whenever Manchester United won a trophy. Unfortunately, his football was less memorable and he is destined to leave Old Trafford in January as one of the most expensive follies in Premier League history, alongside the likes of Fernando Torres and Andriy Shevchenko. United are prepared to let the 26-year-old move back to his homeland in the new year with Gremio and Flamengo leading the chase. And the Old Trafford club don't even want a transfer fee, so desperate are they to say 'Tchau' to one of Sir Alex Ferguson's worst-ever signings. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Anderson's Porto goals and skills that convinced Ferguson . Anderson's fall has been spectacular, with the Brazilian midfielder making just one start this season . Anderson's only full outing came in the shock 4-0 Capital One Cup defeat by League One side MK Dons . Anderson replaces Angel di Maria at Burnley - it is almost certainly his last appearance in a United shirt . The Brazilian has spent rather more time off the pitch than on it this season, as he looks to leave United . Sportsmail looks at the biggest transfer losses in Premier League history: . Dimitar Berbatov (Man United) Bought: £31m from Spurs, 2008 Sold: £5m to Fulham, 2012 Loss: £26m . Never fulfilled Sir Alex Ferguson's expectation that he would have the same influence at Old Trafford as Eric Cantona. United's pace was simply too quick for him and the smoking didn't help. Robinho (Man City) Bought: £32.5m from Real Madrid, 2008 Sold: £15m to AC Milan, 2010 Loss: £17.5m . Skipped a League Cup tie at Brighton in his first month at the club to go back to Brazil. Taken to task by Craig Bellamy for his attitude in training . Andy Carroll (LIverpool) Bought: £35m from Newcastle 2011 Sold: £15m to West Ham 2013 Loss: £20m . Liverpool were panicked into buying Carroll when Fernando Torres told them at the 11th hour he wanted to join Chelsea. But Brendan Rodgers didn't fancy the big No9 and the club cut their losses . Andriy Shevchenko (Chelsea) Bought: £31m from AC Milan, 2006 Sold: Free to Dynamo Kyiv, 2009 Loss: £31m . Cost Jose Mourinho his job. The Special One had won two titles when Roman Abramovich gave him Shevhenko. The striker was badly past it and Mourinho was unable to handle the delicate situation . The cost of bringing Anderson to these shores for what he achieved is mind-boggling. The transfer fee from Porto in 2007 was an estimated £26million and he has earned the same again in wages since then. For the full £50m outlay, he has started 126 games in seven years, with another 53 appearances as substitute, and scored nine goals – around £5.5m a goal. His last, and almost certainly final, appearance in a United shirt came as a late substitute in a goalless draw against Burnley in August. You have to go back to December 2012 for his last goal in a United shirt, against Reaing. He spent last season on loan to Serie A club Fiorentina but they didn't want him on a permanent basis either. It had all started so well for Anderson. On arrival, he was hailed as United's next midfield general, ready to carry the mantle when Paul Scholes' called it a day. The early signs were promising. He played 38 times as United won the Premier League and Champions League in his debut season. He danced for the fans when they clinched the title in Wigan and he danced next to Wayne Rooney on a famous night in Moscow when United became champions of Europe for the third time. He was in the Brazil team, too. But something happened – and cynics would say the all-you-can-eat buffet. Anderson's first season, when he scored in the penalty shootout in the Champions League final, turned out to be his best. Every succeeding year, he appeared that little bit heavier, that little bit more sluggish and less trusted by his manager. Anderson was hailed as a prodigy when United agreed to buy him from Porto in 2007 for £26million . The midfielder enjoyed some good times in his early years at United, playing alongside Cristiano Ronaldo . Nani and Anderson were signed at the same time in the summer of 2007, but neither reached their potential . In February 2010, he ruptured a cruciate ligament against West Ham and insisted the operation was done by a specialist he knew in Portugal. While still in rehab later that year, he was involved in a horrific car accident after leaving a nightclub at 6am, being pulled from a burning £125,000 Audi after it had crashed into a wall. By this time, Anderson – once described as potentially 'better than Rooney' by Sir Alex's brother Martin – was turning into a figure of fun to United team-mates rather than a serious player. Anderson was never afraid of confrontation, as he showed by squaring up to Steven Gerrard in 2007 . It has been a difficult seven years in Manchester for the midfielder, who was once heralded as a future star . Injuries have not helped the Brazilian's cause, and he has struggled for fitness in the past few seasons . Anderson has won eight caps for Brazil but his career has never hit the heights . Despite his troubles, Anderson picked up plenty of silverware at Old Trafford, including the 2009 league title . When David Moyes succeeded Ferguson, he took Anderson on the team's pre-season tour to hot and humid Asia, where Patrice Evra quipped in a video diary his job was to deliver Anderson's burger at one o'clock in the morning. You didn't have to go far within Old Trafford for Anderson to be singled out as the individual who didn't buy into the club philosophy of displaying energy and hard work on the pitch. Although he always possessed attacking flair, Anderson picked up a reputation as a tough tackler . The midfielder clashes with Manchester City assistant David Platt after an FA Cup semi-final in 2011 . Anderson's first season, when he scored a penalty in the Champions League final shoot-out, was his best . Now, with his contract due to run out in the summer without any hope of an extension, it looks as though Gremio will take him back. Gremio was where it all started for Anderson when he was a teenager with the world at his feet, and he got his dream move to Europe with Porto. Ferguson's report on Anderson shortly before he retired was: 'Hasn't lived up to his potential'. Sadly, it looks unlikely he ever will now. Like our Manchester United Facebook page. From battling Lionel Messi on international duty, Anderson is set to go back to his first club Gremio . Anderson celebrates scoring twice against Schalke to book United's place in the Champions League final . At his best Anderson could be a goal-scoring midfielder, who created chances and made tackles .","Anderson joined Manchester United for around £26million in 2007 .

"A woman was bombarded with violent threats from animal lovers on Facebook after allegedly locking her cat in a travel basket and placing it in a half-full bath because it ate her pizza. The woman from Swansea, south Wales, was subject to a torrent of online abuse after telling friends on the social media site she had put the cat 'knee deep' in water for eating her food. Animal lovers from around the world bombarded the 22-year-old with abuse before engaging the RSPCA and local police force. A Facebook user was bombarded with violent threats after posting a photograph online claiming to show her cat locked in a travel basket in half-a-bath of water . Officials later visited the woman's home, but did not bring any charges against her. Within hours of uploading the photograph hundreds of people had shared her post with disgust. More than 3,000 people signed an online petition started in America to have the cat's owner investigated by animal rights authorities, while others subjected her to violent threats and even shared her home address online. 'If you carefully look at the photo, you can’t actually see the cat taking a bath, which technically means there is no actual evidence,' the petition said. 'In a Facebook post published yesterday, she claims she did not put down her cat and criticized animal lovers for attacking her. 'I am personally not making any accusations - it might all prove to be one big fat joke. When questioned by friends, the cat-owner said she put the animal 'knee deep' in water for an hour . 'But if this is true, this incident is unacceptable. At this point, details are rather scarce, so by this petition I am urging the RSPCA to intervene and launch an investigation into this matter as soon as possible. 'We want answers and we want to find out if the cat is okay!' Other animal lovers threatened the cat-owner with violence and even shared her home address on social media sites. '£15 to spend on a pizza ???? Try buying your cat some food instead. No animal would eat a pizza unless they were starving,' one user said. Today the RSPCA confirmed they responded to reports of animal cruelty at the woman's house, but left satisfied there was no further danger to the animal. Facebook users bombarded the woman with online abuse and death threats after noticing the post . 'We can confirm that we were alerted to a photograph on Facebook which appears to show a cat being placed in to a travel basket and put in to a bath of water as a form of punishment,' a spokesman said. 'Our inspectors have investigated the matter and checked the cat's welfare. They have also spoken to the person involved in the incident and given them advice.' 'We are grateful to the members of the public who brought this matter to our attention and we would like to reassure people that the cat involved in the incident was, thankfully, unharmed. 'We would strongly advise against reprimanding any animal and the RSPCA believes the best form of training is through positive reinforcement.'","Woman shared photograph showing cat 'knee-deep in water' in box .

"Not happy: BlackBerry CEO John Chen struggled to convince his own wife to give up her Samsung phone . The CEO of BlackBerry had to tell his wife to stop parading her Samsung Galaxy at parties because it was 'embarrassing' him. John Chen, the businessman trying to save the beleaguered smartphone company, said that he has struggled even to convince his own family that his devices are better than the competition. The unfortunate revelation comes as Chen, 59, tries to convince shareholders that once-dominant BlackBerry, which now has just a 1 per cent share of the smartphone market, can keep making money. In an interview with the Financial Times, Chen revealed that he eventually enforced the use of a BlackBerry device - but that she may well still be carrying on with Samsung on the sly. He said: 'There were a couple of parties we went to and, when my wife brought out the Samsung, everyone kind of looked at me funny. 'So eventually I said she needed to use a BlackBerry. ""No, I like my Samsung"", she said, and I told her she was embarrassing me.' When asked whether she still uses her Galaxy 'in secret', he replied: 'That, I wouldn’t know. There might be a lot of secrets I don’t know.' One piece of information of which Chen will be acutely aware is that investor and consumers are still unsure whether his company has the . Chen was tempted out of retirement to ride to BlackBerry's rescue after it's market share collapsed from 20 per cent to around 1 per cent after Android devices and iPhones lured customers away. At one point, old-style BlackBerry Bold handsets with keypads were beloved of businessmen, politicians and avid texters, including Kim Kardashian, who still hoards old models. The company laid off thousands of workers, while Chen led a turnaround plan which saved BlackBerry from extinction. Tough sell: Chen struggled to tempt his wife with one of BlackBerry's new devices, such as the Passport, left, but struggled to win out against the dominant Samsung Galaxy, right . In a recent interview, he said: 'Once we turn this company to profitability again, I will do everything I can to never lose money ever again.' 'We will survive as a company and now I am rather confident. We're managing the supply chain, we are managing inventories, we are managing cash, and we have expenses now at a number that is very manageable. BlackBerry has survived; now we have to start looking at growth.' A year ago, the smartphone industry pioneer was in the midst of a painful restructuring, scrambling to find a suitor and trying to play down media reports of its 'death spiral.' A year after Chen stepped in as CEO, BlackBerry has begun to act more confidently. The company is hiring again and, though it has yet to turn steady profits, Chen is acquiring small companies and investing in growth. 'He stepped in to catch a falling knife, which is what BlackBerry was at the time losing $1 billion plus,' said Prem Watsa, whose Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd is a major shareholder and which helped bankroll a debt recapitalization that led to Chen's arrival. Heydey: BlackBerry used to command a fifth of the smartphone market thanks to big hitters like its Bold smartphone (photo posed by model) 'He came in and very quickly stabilized it and very quickly laid out a roadmap to breakeven.' But despite the progress, many analysts are yet to be convinced. Thomson Reuters data shows that 25 of 37 analysts covering BlackBerry have a 'hold' rating on the stock. Only one has a 'buy' rating and 11 rate the stock a 'sell.' And although its shares have strengthened since Chen's arrival, its Toronto-listed stock has been bound in the C$6 to C$12.50 range in the last 12 months. In December, the company will launch BlackBerry Classic, a device similar to its once popular Bold smartphone.","John Chen, 59, said his wife wouldn't stop parading her Galaxy while out .

"These photographs capture the views from the top of one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. A group of Russian tourists waited until official visiting hours were over at Egypt's famous Giza Necropolis, before scaling the enormous Great Pyramid as the sun began to set. The Russians managed to escape the attention of security guards at the ancient site, allowing photographer Vitaliy Raskalov to snap pictures of the surrounding desert and the majestic Sphinx from the top of the 455ft structure. Vista: The Russians claim to have arrived early at the famous site on the outskirts of Cairo, where they waited in the shadows until official visitor opening hours were over to make their climb . Officials in Egypt put a stop to people attempting to climb the pyramids in the 1980s, but it thought some guides will still take tourists part of the way up the structures in exchange for bribes. The group of Russians claim to have arrived at the complex early and waited in the shadows before starting their climb as night began to fall, according to a report on the English Russian. The Great Pyramid of Giza is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World and the only one to remain largely intact. It is thought to have been built as a tomb for an ancient Egyptian pharaoh over a period of around 20 years up to 2560BCE. The pyramid was originally covered by highly polished white casing stones that formed a smooth outer surface, but centuries of erosion mean the structure's stepped underlying core is visible today. It is thought to be made up of around 2.3million limestone blocks believed to have been transported from nearby quarries. Originally towering at 481ft, the Great Pyramid was the world's tallest man-made structure for over 3,800 years. Today it stands at 455ft tall, and is dwarfed by the 2,717ft Burj Khalifa in Dubai, which currently holds the title of world's tallest building. Feat: Originally the Great Pyramid, which is thought to have been constructed over a 20 year period, was covered by casing stones that formed an outer surface - what is visible today is the underlying core structure . Sphinx: The group captured the majestic Sphinx monument from their perch atop Giza's Great Pyramid - the oldest and largest of the three pyramids in the Giza Necropolis .

"ISIS is once again urging Muslims to 'kill disbelievers' and attacking Secretary of State John Kerry and President Barack Obama for recent statements they have made about the terrorist group in a new audio recording. Islamic State spokesman Abu Mohammad al-Adnani refers to Sec. of State Kerry as 'the old uncircumcised geezer' and calls Pres. Obama 'the mule of the Jews' on the recording, which is roughly 42-minutes long. He then asks Muslims to do whatever they can to kill those who do not share their faith. Scroll down for video . Spokesman: Abu Mohammad al-Adnani (above) attacked Pres. Barack Obama and Sec. of State John Kerry in a new audio recording released yesterday by ISIS . 'If you can kill a disbelieving American or European - especially the spiteful and filthy French - or an Australian, or a Canadian, or any other disbeliever from the disbelievers waging war, including the citizens of the countries that entered into a coalition against the Islamic State … kill him in any manner or way however it may be,' says al-Adnani. France angered the group when four of their airstrikes killed dozens of the group's fighters  after they targeted a logistics depot in northern Iraq this week. The group then takes aim at Pres. Obama just days after his announcement that 40 countries would aid the U.S. in the fight against ISIS. 'Obama, the mule of the Jews, suddenly became a sheikh, mufti, and an Islamic preacher, warning the people and preaching in defense of Islam, claiming that the Islamic State has nothing to do with Islam,' says al-Adnani. Attacking ISIS: Pres. Obama was called a 'mule of the Jews' just days after he announced that 40 other countries would join the U.S. in the fight against the terrorist group (pictured above) Low blow: The group also called Sec. of State Kerry an 'uncircumcised old geezer' after his comments that the terrorist organization 'did not represent Islam' in front of the House Foreign Affairs Committee . 'This occurred during six different addresses he made in the span of a single month, all of them about the threat of the Islamic State.' The group is also directing their anger at Sec. of State Kerry, who said ISIS was 'not a state' and 'did not represent Islam' in testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee earlier this week. 'The uncircumcised old geezer, suddenly became an Islamic jurist, issuing a verdict to the people that the Islamic State was distorting Islam, that what it was doing was against Islamic teachings, and that the Islamic State was an enemy of Islam,' al-Adani says in his speech, which was translated and released over social media. More airstrikes are expected this week against the group, and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power said on Face The Nation Sunday morning that other countries were willing to join the U.S. in these strikes, though she would not say what countries. These strikes have already begun in Iraq, and been authorized to begin in Syria by Pres. Obama. In addition, the Senate approved a bill to train and arm moderate Syrian rebels to battle Islamic State militants.","ISIS has released a new audio recording that attacks Pres.

"Michael Owen has slammed Manchester United's Premier League showing this season - insisting that his former club should be challenging for the title due to the amount of money they spent in the summer. United outlaid over £150m on the combined talents of new recruits such as Angel Di Maria, Luke Shaw and Daley Blind in the previous transfer window as the Old Trafford sought to rebuild on a disastrous campaign where they finished seventh. However, despite the vast figures spent under new boss Louis van Gaal, the Red Devils' fundamental problems of last term still exist as they trail 12 points behind table-toppers Chelsea in fourth place. Michael Owen has branded Manchester United's season as 'bad' with the club currently fourth in the league . United spent over £150million on players this summer but Louis van Gaal's side are 12 points from the title . Angel Di Maria (right) was signed for a British club-record fee of £60m from Real Madrid in August . And Owen is adamant that securing just a top four spot should be deemed as a bad season for United due to the vast investment in the squad. ‘People keep saying they are going to get (a) top four (finish) and that was the aim, that is (the) absolute bare minimum. Top four for Manchester United?,' he told BT Sport's Football Tonight Show. 'After spending £150 million and having the players they have and the stadium – they should be first, second, third. Third should be a bad season. 'How they are accepting that they are not challenging for the title having spent that money on those calibre of players. It’s not a good season.’ United's 2-0 win at QPR on Saturday moved them on to 40 points after 22 games this season. With the scoreline goalless at half-time the Red Devils' travelling supporters deplored for a change of Van Gaal's preferred 3-5-2 formation to a more conventional 4-4-2 style, which the Dutchman eventually heeded. Van Gaal's choice of formation and tactics have been accused of hindering United's hitherto, swashbuckling traditional brand of football and Owen concurs that the club aren't creating the amount of chances that they use to in the past. United fans, pictured celebrating, were screaming ‘four-four-two’ during the side's initial struggles at QPR . ‘I don’t think any of the strikers are performing. Robin van Persie has gone quiet, he’s scored the odd goal but he’s not the player he was over the past few years,' he added. 'I don’t necessarily blame the strikers as Manchester United aren’t creating loads and loads of chances. 'They are not functioning as a team and if you don’t function as a team, and your strikers and midfielders aren’t working hard then you’ll concede goals – it’s not just about the defence. If you’re not playing well throughout the team you won’t score enough goals as the strikers aren’t getting enough chances.’ ‘The likes of Juan Mata and Van Persie need to start doing more. Mata’s had a half decent season but I wouldn’t say I’m his biggest fan. Ashley Young has been really good and done well when he’s played wing back, he’s unlucky not to get in the team but it’s not very balanced at the moment.’ Van Gaal's men travel to Cambridge United in the FA Cup fourth round on Friday night, before hosting Leicester at home in the Premier League on January 31. Owen also believes United striker Robin van Persie (front) isn't the player he once was a few years ago . Michael Owen was speaking on Football Tonight, BT Sport’s football debate and news round-up show.","Manchester United won 2-0 at QPR in the Premier League on Saturday .

True measure of a top coach like Jose Mourinho or Louis van Gaal is to find a lower-league gem and make him into a world beater like Ian Rush or Stuart Pearce . Wayne Rooney and Jack Wilshere have a telepathic understanding that gives England a fighting chance at Euro 2016 . I'm surprised how much Roy Keane’s second autobiography made me laugh. And who knew he would let his daily horoscope decide his career path? More importantly the book told me that Keane should be the next Manchester United manager. The more I read what he had to say, and his reflections on his two jobs as a boss, the more I realised how perfect he would be at Old Trafford. Ryan Giggs may be a legend at United, but learning how to manage on the job is not what you should be doing at a club like that. If Giggs takes over it means United are giving that massive job to a rookie. Any appointment is a gamble, but that’s one they don’t need to risk. Keane has the United history. He understands the club. He understands how top players work. He can deal with the expectations. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roy Keane on managing and his influences . Roy Keane has learnt his managerial trade at Sunderland and Ipswich and now works with Ireland and Villa . Keane, giving instructions for Ireland, has a history with Manchester United and knows how top players work . Keane speaks to Ireland's record goalscorer and captain Robbie Keane ahead of the game in Germany . Crucially, Keane has learned his trade elsewhere and I don’t think he gets enough credit for the brilliant job he did at Sunderland. He took over a club that was in turmoil, losing games and potentially dropping into the third tier of English football. He turned them into a winning machine in a short space of time and took them up as champions. The next season he kept them in the Premier League. Then after a ridiculous disagreement with the owner Ellis Short, Keane and Sunderland parted company. It was a bizarre end to his successful time there. Keane's new autobiography The Second Half has grabbed a lot of headlines over the past week . Ryan Giggs (left) has been learning his managerial trade under Louis van Gaal at Manchester United . Keane walked into a club with huge expectations, at a very low ebb and turned them around. He admits his mistakes, and even better he learned from them. His time at Ipswich wasn’t good at all – but then not many managers in the last 10 years have done anything at that club. The massive lesson he learned there was communication, with the owner and others running the club. Because that communication failed, Ipswich ended up paying massively over the top transfer fees for players. They really did pay £1.7million for Tamas Priskin. Incredible. Keane and Sir Alex Ferguson fell out towards the end of his time at Old Trafford . Keane, pictured with Niall Quinn, led Sunderland to promotion in his first managerial job . Keane's next job at Ipswich was tougher - but no manager has had success there in the last decade . That’s a lesson learned that he can take into his next job – managing upwards at a club, dealing with the board, the chairman and the chief executive. I like how he accepts criticism for some of his decisions – like selling goalscorer Jordan Rhodes when he was at Portman Road. A man who takes the blame is a man who’s on top of his ego. He’s now getting experience as an assistant at Premier League and international level. Is he on top of his anger? Probably not totally, but he might need a bit of that to deal with issues at a big club like United. He had a player turning up late regularly at Sunderland, and when Keane dropped him as punishment, the player’s agent phoned to make the excuse that the player lived on a busy junction. Keane was always a fierce leader on the pitch during his years as Manchester United captain . Keane won seven Premier League titles and four FA Cups in his time at Old Trafford . If you were Keane, you’d be angry. Is he in control of his inner chimp? Well Keane says in his autobiography he tried to read the book The Chimp Paradox by the sports psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters. But he admitted he couldn’t get through it – his inner chimp wouldn’t let him. Keane is made to be manager of Manchester United. When Louis van Gaal’s work is done, the time will be right for the Irishman to be welcomed back to Old Trafford. VIDEO Forgive Fergie?

"Art work produced by Nelson Mandela showing the views he spent 27 years looking at from his prison cell window have emerged for sale.

That's what I saw: He returned to the cell many times after his release, including in 1999 when this picture was taken .

"A photographer has captured the moment a man diced with death after he climbed onto a rocky outpost cut off by huge waves. The man scaled the 50ft ancient rock stack on the Isle of Portland near Weymouth in Dorset and stood at the top for 10 minutes as huge storms battered the coastline yesterday. He has been branded ‘a lunatic’ for the daredevil stunt on Pulpit Rock, which has prompted coastguards to issue a warning. Scroll down for video . The man was pictured standing on top of 50ft Pulpit Rock on the Isle of Portland for 10 minutes during severe storms yesterday . Photographer Sean Hepburn, 50, was documenting yesterday’s storms, which saw gale-force winds of more than 60mph, when he spotted the man. Mr Hepburn said: ‘I live on Portland and spend a lot of time on the headland taking photos of the weather. ‘I went up there yesterday and set up at a safe place I use a lot to get some pictures of the huge waves that were crashing over the rocks. ‘It was a lot rougher than I had expected it to be. ‘Then, along came a lunatic and his girlfriend who tried to climb to the top of Pulpit Rock, an exposed rock stack right on the tip of the headland. ‘It's a real scramble to get up onto it at the best of times let alone when there are monster waves crashing all around it.’ He added that the woman that was with the man was ‘obviously disgusted’ with his behaviour and left. ‘He stayed on top of the rock for 10 minutes then got back down. ‘He was incredibly lucky a big wave didn't break over the rock during that time. He is seen attempting to scramble back down the rock as waves crash violently against it. Coastguards have since issued a warning . ‘The ones that were breaking onto the shore were just colossal. ‘If he had ended up in the sea he would without a doubt have been a goner. It’s just ridiculous – it’s not worth the risk.’ He added: ‘Freak waves do break over Pulpit Rock in big seas and it would only take one to come in and it would be game over for anyone on top of the rock.’ Coastguards said apart from risking their own lives, these stunts also endangered teams going to their rescue as it draws away resources which could be needed to help people in ‘genuine distress’. Mike Douglas, from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, said: ‘Our advice is to stay away from cliff edges or rocks as they can be crumbly or slippery when wet, which is certainly the case with the recent bad weather. Photographer Sean Hepburn was documenting the severe weather conditions when he spotted the man he dubbed a 'lunatic' Pulpit Rock at Portland Bill in Dorset during calmer conditions. The artificial stack of rock was left in the 1870s after a natural arch was cut away by quarrymen at the Bill Quarry on the famous headland and is a popular tourist attraction . ‘Do not attempt to climb up or down rocks or cliffs unless you are trained and equipped to do so. If you get into difficulty, or spot someone else in trouble, call 999 and ask for the coastguard.’ Flood alerts were again issued for the Dorset coast from Lyme Regis to Portland this morning with residents urged to be aware of the risk at high tide. Householders are still mopping up after Commercial Road next to Weymouth’s inner harbour was flooded on Wednesday night. Condor Ferries cancelled sailings between Weymouth and the Channel Islands and the storms also left some communities, including Osmington, without power. And the Met Office is predicting more storms for today with the possibility of hail overnight. Dorset weatherman Bob Poots said Weymouth has already had a third of the rain that is expected to fall over the month of October.","The man scaled the 50ft ancient rock stack - Pulpit Rock - on the Isle of Portland in Weymouth, Dorset, yesterday .

"An aid worker who has seen the deadly effects of the fast-spreading Ebola virus in West Africa says there is 'no reason' why Australian military troops cannot join the fight to stop the outbreak. Australian Ali Readhead's comments comes after Labor deputy leader Tanya Plibersek said the government was not doing enough to assist the growing health threat. So far Australia's efforts to tackle Ebola is focussed on hospitals and airports as a deal is sought to ensure health workers sent to Africa can be quickly evacuated and treated. Scroll down for video . Perth woman Ali Readhead has been working in Sierra Leone for two years, and more recently has seen the devastating effect the Ebola outbreak is having on the region . Ms Readhead penned a opinion-editorial saying to government had no excuse for not sending military experts to West Africa to help fight the outbreak, urging to follow their northern hemisphere counterparts. 'First, Australia doesn't need to commit large numbers of military doctors and nurses in order to make a difference.' she wrote. 'The U.K. is sending 460 medics to Sierra Leone in five-week rotations - meaning that over a period of six months there will be no more than 92 medics in country at any one time. 'These medics are being deployed specifically to train national health workers to run the five new treatment facilities being built. 'U.K. medics will not be treating Ebola patients and will return to the U.K .after the training. This approach works because Ebola is a straightforward virus to treat, requiring basic level health workers who are readily available in Sierra Leone. 'There is no reason why the Australian Government can't take the same approach to the provision of medical care.' The disease is spreading fast without the appropriate resources to contain those infected . Ali (centre) seen here at the christening of her god-daughter, said it is impossible to contain Ebola without expert military medical teams from Australia, the UK and the US . Ms Readhead also criticised Kennedy MP Bob Katter's reaction to the Ebola scare in Cairns involving Red Cross Australia volunteer nurse Sue Ellen Kovack last week. 'How did Australia respond? Federal MP Bob Katter has accused Ms Kovack of putting Australia at risk because of her ""humanitarian ambitions"",' Ms Readhead wrote. The federal opposition says the $18 million provided by the coalition government to tackle the virus, which is killing thousands of people in west Africa, is not enough. Labor deputy leader Tanya Plibersek believes Australia should be sending in health workers and other experts to help fight Ebola, which presents a threat to health and international security. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the aid spending, which came on top of $40 million for the World Health Organisation, was a creditable effort so far. Mr Abbott thinks it is irresponsible to send in Australian personnel without an agreement to fly them out immediately and get them quickly to a high-quality hospital if they contracted the virus. In Sierra Leone there are only 30 beds available for Ebola patients, so hundreds more are forced to stay at home until people die and free up space in the hospitals . Ms Readhead (centre) celebrated Australia day with fellow countrymen in Freetown this year . Ms Readhead's op-ed comes after the aid worker said the area was completely unprepared to deal with the crisis. Originally from Perth in Western Australia, Ms Readhead has been living in Sierra Leone for the past two years and has seen first hand the devastation the disease is causing. 'It's chaos. They're totally under-resourced,' she told Daily Mail Australia last month. 'Patients are getting left in their houses because we just don't have any room.' In the capital city, Freetown, there are only 30 beds available to those with Ebola, despite there being thousands of people infected or suspected to have contracted the potentially fatal virus. 'They're just waiting for people to die to free up the beds,' Ms Readhead said. Ms Readhead originally moved to Freetown to work on the women and children's health policy, but when Ebola began to spread received a direct request from the Minister of Health in Sierra Leone to help fight the disease. But she believed the only real way to contain the virus was if Australia and other nations sent expert military medical teams to set up field hospitals and isolation centres, two things which Freetown need so desperately. 'The only way we have a chance of containing this outbreak is if we deploy military', Ms Readhead said before adding that they would be able to accommodate a level of risk humanitarian aid can't. The aid worker has started a petition which has already garnered over 33,000 signatures, urging Foreign Minister Julie Bishop to do more than financially support the situation. 'I've never been more devastated in my life. Last week I returned to Perth after working with the health ministry in Sierra Leone – witnessing first hand how the deadly Ebola virus is spiralling out of control and killing hundreds.' 'It's terrifying, and to be honest I'm not sure anyone knows when or how it'll end. What I saw will stay with me forever – in some places there aren't enough ambulances to pick up those infected or bury the dead,' Ms Readhead wrote on Change.org. The country's government burial team is seen here carrying the coffin of Dr Modupeh Cole, Sierra Leone's second senior physician to die of Ebola . Fellow Australian Jo Dunlop (left) and British doctor Oliver Johnson have been fighting alongside Ms Readhead (centre) to keep Freetown's main isolation centre open . Ms Readhead said she believed there was hesitation in sending personnel overseas as there was a risk of infection. The reality is less than ten aid workers have contracted Ebola, and if isolation facilities were set up alongside US and the UK in West Africa treatment would be incredibly easy. Ms Readhead also revealed the wider devastation the spread of Ebola was having on the community, economy, and already struggling healthcare system. People are terrified to visit hospitals, which is having devastating effects on the number of people accessing the health facilites, a problem the region has already been battling with for years. 'Pregnant ladies are giving birth at home, if your baby has malaria you don't take them to the hospital', Ms Readhead revealed. 'The hospitals are empty beside Ebola patients.' She also told of how tough the struggle was to break down the stigma around accessing healthcare services, and how the disease is quickly unravelling all the hard work. One in eight women died during childbirth before the government introduced free healthcare for pregnant women. This is worst outbreak of Ebola the region has ever seen, and the first time it has appeared in such an urban and highly populated area. If it is not contained soon, the projection is grim. Authorities believe it could spread to more than 1.4 million people across the region if urgent and desperately needed help is not received. The reason the virus is spreading so quickly is the close communities without standalone houses and the close proximity of marketplaces with many people packed into them allow it to spread with much greater ease. 'We don't have that level of contact in Australia... (and) we've got the medical expertise to be able to put in place the correct procedures', Ms Readhead said when asked if Ebola could post a threat to her home country. Despite the devastating health implications, the aid worker insisted there is much more at stake than the terrible loss of life. Ms Readhead ran the Sierra Leone marathon last year with her mum there to show her support . Already unstable economies in the region are likely to crumble under the pressure, and this process has already begun . Already unstable economies in the region are likely to crumble under the pressure, and this process has already begun. Mining companies completing projects in West Africa have pulled workers out of the area in fear of Ebola, and others with 'investments in the pipelines are being disbanded.' The disease has already claimed hundreds of lives in countries in the area, and could claim many more if urgent action is not taken, Ms Readhead warned. 'It can definitely be contained... if we have beds for suspected or confirmed patients, healthworkers who are able to treat them. 'Unless we have those two things on the ground we don't stand a chance.' More than 700 people have arrived at Australian airports from west African countries since the outbreak. The 11 arrivals suspected of Ebola have all tested negative. Most of the estimated 4,500 Ebola cases worldwide have been in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, but Nigeria, Senegal, Spain and US have also recorded cases.","Australia woman Ali Readhead has been in Sierra Leone for two years .

"West Ham manager Sam Allardyce has vowed to go all out for the FA Cup this season, rather than rest players in pursuit of European qualification from the Barclays Premier League. A 3-0 victory over Hull on Sunday means West Ham are seventh in the table and have twice as many points as they did this time last year. Allardyce prioritised survival 12 months ago and was widely criticised when a second-string line-up was dumped out of the FA Cup third round after a 5-0 humiliation at the hands of Nottingham Forest. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce is aiming to win the FA Cup this season . Andy Carroll celebrates with team-mates after scoring the opening goal in The Hammers' 3-0 win over Hull . West Ham visit League One high-fliers Bristol City in the fourth round on Sunday and Allardyce insists he will be fielding his strongest team available. 'The FA Cup is very important to us and given our position in the league is very secure, we don't have to consider resting players for Premier League results,' Allardyce said. 'We hadn't had a win in four in the Premier League before Hull and now we've won the game it gives us a great opportunity to focus on Bristol City and make sure we get through to the fifth round. 'We've come through the hardest period of all which is Christmas and new year and we're also steering clear of injuries so we have an opportunity to go forward in both the Premier League and the FA Cup this season.' Hull City's Harry Maguire slides in to challenge West Ham right-back Carl Jenkinson . West Ham's excellent campaign so far owes much to their summer signings, with the likes of Diafra Sakho, Enner Valencia and Morgan Amalfitano all contributing to the team's push for the European spots. Amalfitano came off the bench to score the third goal against Hull and Allardyce admits the summer transfer window was the best he has overseen in his managerial career. 'There's one thing you realise as a manager - recruitment is everything,' Allardyce said. 'It's everything in the world for a football manager. 'If you recruit well you get better players, those players take things on board quicker, you get better results and you become a better manager. 'Our recruitment has been fantastic. 'To have so many players make such a difference, it's the best I've ever had in my entire career.' Alex Song signed on loan from Spanish giants Barcelona last summer and has made a huge impact . Enner Valencia signed from Mexican side Pachuca in the summer for a reported £12 million . West Ham's co-owners David Sullivan and David Gold issued a 10-point plan for the next five years on Monday, including a promise to bring 'more world-class players' to the club. 'Our aim is to bring in more world-class players that can play in the 'West Ham Way',' read a statement on the official club website. 'We have broken the club's transfer record twice in the last three years and we will continue to make significant funds available to strengthen the playing squad this summer as we build a team that will befit our new home. 'We will also endeavour to hang onto our best players as, too often in the past, previous boards have sold our most promising players.' Jenkinson runs over to Stewart Downing, who scored West Ham's third goal on Sunday . One player who does, however, look set to leave is defender Winston Reid, whose contract expires at the end of the season and is yet to sign a new deal. Reid was left out of the starting line-up against the Tigers on Sunday but Allardyce insisted the 26-year-old's omission had nothing to do with his future. Allardyce said: 'He's just recovered from injury and James Collins and James Tomkins were magnificent against Everton on Tuesday.' New Zealand defender Winston Reid looks set to leave West Ham .","The 60-year-old wants to win the FA Cup this season .

"The former St. Louis County Police Chief has said he believes federal authorities are purposely leaking details of the Michael Brown case because they already know that no charges are going to be brought against Officer Darren Wilson. Tim Fitch has claimed the controversial New York Times article published last week which details a frantic struggle between 18-year-old Brown and Wilson over his weapon inside a squad car is all part of a strategy to 'let people down slowly'. The retired police chief says he believes federal authorities accept it is 'probably very unlikely' that the grand jury will recommend no charges be brought against 28-year-old Wilson and he expects to see more leaks like this in the next few weeks. Scroll down for video . St. Louis County police chief Tim Fitch is now retired but he has claimed the federal authorities are trying to prepare the public for no charges being brought against Officer Darren Wilson for the shooting of unarmed Ferguson teenager, Michael Brown . 'There was a struggle over the weapon. Law enforcement, we know that about half the officers killed every year with firearms are killed with their own,' said Fitch to CBS St. Louis. 'So the fact that he didn't have his own doesn't mean there wasn't a weapon there available that could be used in deadly force use.' Addressing the New York Times article published last Friday, which included leaks from the grand jury which is taking place in secret, Fitch said he would call the sensational information phase two of the feds strategy. In other words, 'to coordinate leaks to the media, and to start getting some of the facts out there to kind of let people down gently,' said Fitch to CBS St. Louis. 'When I say this is phase two – phase one was really Eric Holder's announcement how they were going to basically do a complete review and take over the Ferguson Police Department.' 'Self defense': Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson says he feared for his life as he shot Michael Brown . Fitch said in his own opinion, physical evidence is preferable to eye-witness evidence. 'Physical evidence has no reason to lie. It doesn't see things differently,' he said to CBS St. Louis. 'If there was a struggle inside that car over a firearm, it sounds to me like Officer Wilson would have been justified in taking the action he did if he pulled the trigger and actually shot Michael Brown in the vehicle area.' Taking the logic of a police officer to what he feels is the necessary conclusion, Fitch explained how he thinks the grand jury will see the most controversial part of the death of Michael Brown - his fatal shooting while holding his hands aloft in surrender outside of the car. However, Fitch claims that if the grand jury leans towards what Wilson claims - that Brown was charging him when he opened fire - they will have no chance but to leave him uncharged. 'If Michael Brown was truly turned around and basically charging the officer, he already went for round one fighting over his handgun. Are you going to go for round two and take the chance of losing it this time?' Fitch said to CBS St. Louis. Struggle: According to FBI analysis Brown's blood was found inside Officer Wilson's patrol car. the cop claims he wrestled with Brown in the car and was in fear of his life. But the account is disputed . 'I think that would be a more logical explanation as to why Officer Wilson would have discharged his firearm at Michael Brown.' Fitch then said that police officers have a lawful authority to apply force and they are under no obligation to retreat. Indeed, Fitch said he fully expects to see more leaks ove the coming weeks. According to those in Ferguson who have been in Ferguson during the protests and racial unrests following the shooting, they are concerned about the grand jury result now. 'If there is not an indictment, excuse my French, all hell is going to break loose,' one protester told CNN. Benjamin Crump, the attorney for Brown's parents, told The Associated Press on Saturday that the officer's account of what happened was 'self-serving.' 'The officer is going to say whatever he has to say to try to justify killing an unarmed teenager,' Crump said. 'And certainly, his statement should not be taken above independent eye witnesses who are completely unbiased when he has every reason to be biased.' Crump also said that because there were reports that Michael Brown was shot while he ran away, it 'doesn't matter' what happened in the car beforehand. 'He was definitely not in fear of threat when Michael Brown was running away from him,' Crump said. Solidarity: Protesters are pictured here in Ferguson Monday night continuing a vigil for Michael Brown . Tensions: Police officers watch over the residents who have taken to the streets again, more than two months after the shooting . Memorial: Neighbors wait by a memorial set up on Canfield Street, Ferugson - the spot where Brown was killed . The Times reported that Wilson has told investigators that he was trying to leave his SUV when Brown pushed him back in and that once inside the vehicle the two began to fight. Wilson told authorities that Brown punched and scratched him repeatedly, leaving swelling on his face and cuts on his neck, the Times reported. Wilson, who had been patrolling Ferguson for nearly three years, was placed on leave after the shooting. A state grand jury is considering charges against him. Wilson is being represented by James P. Towey, general counsel for the Missouri Fraternal Order of Police and a former general counsel for the St. Louis Police Officers Association. Towey didn't immediately respond to an email Saturday seeking comment, and his work phone system wasn't accepting voicemail. The Justice Department is investigating the Ferguson Police Department for possible civil rights violations, including whether officers there use excessive force and engage in discriminatory practices. Two-thirds of Ferguson's 21,000 residents are black but only three of its more than 50 police officers are black. Brian Schellman, a spokesman for St. Louis County Police, which has taken control of Ferguson security, said in an email that the department doesn't comment on active investigations.","Retired St. Louis Police Chief Tim Fitch made controversial claims .

"Sir Alex Ferguson has compared the beginning of Louis van Gaal's Old Trafford reign to his own troubled start at Manchester United and backed the Dutchman to turn the club around.

The Scot took three-and-a-half years to win his first trophy at United after the board refused to bow to pressure to sack him, and he is in no doubt that Van Gaal will receive the same support now even though his predecessor David Moyes was axed after just 10 months in charge.

'What we needed then was Sir Bobby Charlton, Martin Edwards and the board to stick by me and we had a great spell after that. 'Once I got settled into the club, everything was fine. Louis is going through that same process and there's no doubt in my mind that he will sort it out.' Ferguson (right) watches his United side lose their first game against Oxford United back in 1986 .

Ferguson says Van Gaal (left, at a press conference in 2009) has not sough him out for advice . Ferguson revealed that Van Gaal has not sought him out for advice since taking over in the summer, adding: 'There's no ongoing dialogue. He comes into my office sometimes after the game, into the lounge, and we have a chat. 'But it's not a matter of picking up a phone or anything like that. He's a very capable person with a strong mentality. He's a strong leader. He knows where I am if he ever did need me but there has not been any need for him to phone me.' The 72-year-old played a prominent role in appointing Moyes and was then criticised for being too high profile at United games, casting a shadow over his successor as he struggled to get to grips with the magnitude of the job.

The 72-year-old gives a speech at the Nordic Business Forum in Helsinki, Finland, last week . Asked if he is annoyed at how that has been portrayed, he said: 'There's a bit of that. I haven't been to every game, obviously. I've missed a couple this season already but I've been to a few of them and I continue to do that. 'The way I've always been and I did it as a manager, I'm actually quite stone-faced watching a game. I don't try to show any emotions unless we score. I always celebrate a goal, even now as a director I still celebrate a goal. You're always conscious maybe the cameras are on you and this is happening quite a lot. 'I got annoyed when we lost to Liverpool last year. I didn't enjoy that. I don't like losing to Liverpool and Manchester City last year, because they are your biggest rivals and the ones you always strive to defeat and are always in our way. Particularly Liverpool of course.' Ferguson, watching United take on Stoke last season, says he is 'stone-faced' when in the stands . Steven Gerrard celebrates in Liverpool's 3-0 win at Old Trafford last season, a result which annoyed Ferguson . The breakup of Ferguson's squad, in particular the £16m sale of Danny Welbeck to Arsenal, and spending on headline signings like Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao has raised concerns that United have betrayed their roots of bringing young players through their academy. Ferguson's old No 2 Mike Phelan even suggested that Welbeck's departure was a sign that the club's 'identity has been broken'. But Ferguson backed Van Gaal's restructuring and praised the new manager for giving the likes of Tyler Blackett, Paddy McNair, Jesse Lingard and James Wilson an opportunity in the Premier League. 'What has pleased me about Louis is he's given seven young kids their debuts this year which falls into line with the history of our club, there's no question about that,' he added. 'I think that's exactly what Louis van Gaal believes in too. I think the greatest example is how he produced at Ajax to win the European Cup with all players created by Ajax themselves. Edwin van der Sar was in goal, Edgar Davids, Patrick Kluivert. Some fantastic players - all produced by the club. Van Gaal has given youngster Tyler Blackett (left) opportunities to play first-team football this season . Academy product Paddy McNair (right, in action against Everton) has also featured in the first team today . 'Obviously Louis has made a lot of changes and I was thinking about that actually. Maybe he's doing the right and correct thing, to clear the decks and build his own team, because he's got the experience and the coaching ability to do that. And he's got the reputation to do that. I think the way he's approached is, I think, brilliant. 'It's the rebuilding of the team and they brought in some good quality. It was really important because you need quality at Manchester United, you need the best players. 'I think when you can identify ability like that needed by Manchester United, they have the resources to do that. They are fees I never quite equalled but nonetheless they were needing quite a big injection this year. '(Ander) Herrera played against us three years ago for Bilbao in the Europa League. He's a talented young player and we scouted him quite a lot at that time. Obviously I think they tried to get him last year but it fell through for some reason or another. He's athletic, quite aggressive actually for a lad who has not got a great frame and he's quite slim but he's quite aggressive and he gets around the pitch. Van Gaal allowed Danny Welbeck to leave Old Trafford for Arsenal in a £16m deadline day deal . Ferguson admits United attempted to sign Luke Shaw (right) when he was just 16 before landing him for £30m . 'The signing of (Luke) Shaw was the one we tried to get when he was 16 years of age. They wouldn't sell him to us but they always said we'd be first to know if they ever did. Of course, Ed Woodward has carried that through and we got him for, I think it was £30m. He's a talented boy, a good footballer who likes to get forward all the time. '(Marcos) Rojo, the Argentinian boy, I watched him at the World Cup, I thought he did really well for them and I think he's capable of playing either left side as a wing-back if you like or as a centre-back. 'Daley Blind is one of those common-sense footballers that make up a team. He's probably a version of Darren Fletcher of a few years ago, that type of player. He's a good professional with common sense to his game. He keeps it simple and protects the defenders and the attacking midfield players in his role. 'The big one is Falcao who we're all waiting to see. Obviously, he has fantastic goalscoring ability. He had his injury so getting him on loan is the right thing to do.'","Sir Alex Ferguson has backed Louis van Gaal to get Manchester United back on track after a difficult start to the season .

"The UK government is bidding for a £6million contract to help run prisons in Saudi Arabia. Human rights groups have raised concerns about the deal, at a time of worldwide outrage at the country's justice system. David Cameron has faced criticism for fawning tributes to the King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia – despite his country's shameful record on human rights. A criminal gets a public flogging by two officials in Saudi Arabia in rare public footage of Saudi Arabia's brutal criminal justice system . Flags were ordered to fly at half-mast across Westminster while the Prime Minister joined Prince Charles to fly to Jeddah to pay his respects. The reaction was condemned by critics who said King Abdullah's rule saw regular public beheadings and floggings – and homosexuality punished by death. Now it has emerged that an arm of the UK's Ministry of Justice has submitted a £5.9million bid to 'to conduct a training needs analysis across all the learning and development programmes within the Saudi Arabian Prison Service'. It raises the prospect of the UK government profiting from the Saudi regime through Just Solutions international (JSi), the commercial brand for the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) which is 'promoting products and services to international justice markets'. JSi has also submitted a 'large scale bid' to the Royal Oman Police to help with the design of a new prison and last year won a £848,000 contract to support the development of a Probation Service in Macedonia. David Cameron faced criticism for flying to Riyadh to pay tribute to King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia . However, the prospect of a deal with Saudi Arabia comes at a hugely sensitive time. Saudi Arabia, which last year is reported to have carried out 87 beheadings, has attracted further outrage after the first public flogging of blogger Raif Badawi, 31, who was sentenced to 1,000 lashes and ten years in jail for highlighting the kingdom's harsh laws on dissent. A video taken by a policeman last week of four colleagues dragging a woman down the street of Mecca and taking three attempts to behead her with a sword highlighted the crude brutality of the ruling regime's justice system. In one of the most horrific cases during King Abdullah's reign, 15 schoolgirls died after religious police stopped them leaving a burning building because they were not in Islamic dress. Allan Hogarth, Amnesty's UK head of policy and government affairs, told The Guardian: 'Amnesty has serious concerns about Saudi Arabia's justice system, given its use of the death penalty, the prevalence of torture in detention, and its use of cruel and degrading punishment. 'So we need to know – how is the MoJ's scheme going to help improve the situation?' Mr Cameron was joined by Prince Charles to offer condolences following the death of Saudi King Abdullah in Riyadh who died early on Friday and his brother Salman became king of the world's top oil exporter . Adam Coogle, Middle East researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: 'Quiet training programmes are not a substitute for active British engagement with the Saudi authorities on human rights abuses in the justice system. 'We find that pressure works better when Saudi abuses are in the international spotlight. They don't usually tend to back down because someone has a private conversation. Public advocacy is necessary.' If the deal goes ahead it would have to be signed off by the Foreign Office after an evaluation that covered human rights. Full details of the contract, including human rights safeguards, will be made public if JSi is successful. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'Just Solutions international provides knowledge and expertise of prison and offender management services to international organisations and governments who work with offenders. 'It has been government policy for many years to work with overseas governments and help them develop their criminal justice systems, utilising that knowledge to bring funds to the public purse. 'JSi does not work with countries unless it is completely safe to do so and details of any contracts will be made public when agreed.'","Commercial arm of Ministry of Justice bids for work from Saudi Arabia .

"When their five-year-old pestered them to let him play on their iPad, Greg and Sharon Kitchen’s first instinct was to say No. But faced with the distraction of a house full of visitors, along with their son’s insistence that the game he wanted to play was free, and you might understand why they eventually said Yes. That decision was a costly one. The next day they found out their son Danny’s little game-playing session had cost them £1,700. Scroll down for video . Common: The kitchen family was shocked when son Danny, center, racked up £1,700 pounds ($2,600) for add-ons in a free-to-download game . Oops! Five-year-old Danny Kitchen was left in tears after his parents told him how much money he had spent . Yesterday the Kitchens warned other . parents of the danger of allowing children to play ‘free’ games which . come with hidden costs. Although Apple has since refunded the full . amount, the family said it has been a tough lesson to learn. Danny had asked his father for a . passcode to download a game called Zombies v Ninja, which involves . touching the iPad screen to aim ninja-style weapons at cartoon zombies. His parents then left him occupied while they entertained friends at . their home. But by pressing a shopping trolley icon on the screen, Danny was offered the chance to buy extra animated ‘ammunition’. His mother knew nothing about his . subsequent spending spree until she saw emails from iTunes the following . day listing what he had bought. ‘Danny was pestering us to let him have a go on the iPad,’ she said from the family home in Warmley, near Bristol. ‘He kept saying it was a free game so my husband put in the passcode and handed it to him. The app involves throwing darts and bombs at zombies and users can get extras... but at a cost . The game is free but the creators get their money from extra weapons . ‘It worried me when he asked  for the . password but I had a look  at the game, it said it was free  so I . didn’t think there would be a problem. 'We had lots of visitors in the house . and were both a little preoccupied. I woke up Monday morning and looked . at my emails and had loads from iTunes. 'I thought it must be a mistake, so I . checked my bank balance online and nothing had been taken out. I thought . nothing of it until my credit card adviser phoned and told me they had . authorise  the transaction.’ Danny had bought dozens of in-game ‘weapons’ and ‘keys’ which cost up to £69.99 a time. ‘I can’t believe he was able to spend . so much,’ said Mrs Kitchen, a mother of five who runs a children’s . entertainment business with her husband. ‘It was far too easy a thing for  him to do and more should be done to limit stuff like this from happening. ‘I told Danny he’d better get ready for bed and run and hide before Daddy got home. ‘Through his tears he turned  back and . said “But where can I hide?” Bless him – that stopped me being angry . but of course, it’s a lot  of money.’ Danny said: ‘I said to Dad can you put . the passcode for the game, he said no and then I said it was free so he . said yes. The next day it cost lots of money. I was worried and I felt . sad. I was crying. I’m not sure how I did it, I thought it was free. ‘I’m banned from the iPad now.’ Mr Kitchen, 44, said: ‘I was livid. Not amused at all. But Danny was very sorry so I couldn’t stay mad at . him for long. I’m relieved that they have said they are going to give us . back our money.’ An Apple spokesman said it was vital that parents kept . their passcodes safe and  said software was available to  prevent . children from using the iTunes store. In an email to Mr Kitchen the company . said iPads, iPhones and iPod touches have built-in parental controls to . restrict access to content. They also have the option to turn off . ‘in-app purchases’. The Restrictions menu in Apple's iOS software lets you control in-app purchases, and can even be used to stop children downloading apps entirely. Parents can set a password for in-app purchases or turn them off altogether. It's also possible to prevent apps being deleted or installed and control access to age-restricted content. To prevent in-app purchases in iOS, open 'Settings' then choose 'General' and 'Restrictions'. Then tap 'Enable Restrictions', choose a PIN and enter it a second time to confirm. Now you can set restrictions from the menu below. In the 'Allowed Content' menu, slide 'In app purchases' to 'Off' to stop children's ability to run up bills. Angry Birds, pictured, was one of the games featured in a lawsuit in America over children running up huge bills on 'free' games . Apple is to pay £66million in compensation to parents in the U.S. whose children ran up massive bills using its free apps. Youngsters who made purchases playing the online games generated hefty charges on their parents' credit cards. Now as many as 23million people are eligible for a refund. However, the decision is unlikely to affect British families. A number of software companies have developed games that are popular with children. These 'bait apps' let you buy credit in order to progress through the game. When children purchase 'currency', their parent's iTunes account gets automatically charged. Apple started requiring users to input a password to authorise transactions in March 2011. But many parents around the world had already been hit by large and unexpected bills. A US legal case was triggered by a nine-year-old girl from Pennsylvania who bought $200 (£132) of 'virtual money' from three free Apple games. In a lawsuit brought by her father, the games were described as 'highly addictive' and designed to 'compel' children to buy game currency. Under the terms of the case settlement, Apple has now agreed to offer refunds worth a total of $100million (£66million). The company has not announced plans to compensate any parents in the UK. Those claiming $30 or more from Apple may choose to receive a cash refund instead of an iTunes store credit, according to the filing. The case involves games such as Angry Birds, Zombie Takeover, Playmobil Pirates, and Racing Penguin, some of which are offered as free downloads on tablets such as Apple's iPad.","Danny Kitchen downloaded £69.99 add-on 19 times in just 10 minutes .

"Hard work is a sacred truth in the Ruhr Valley. This sweep of Germany was famous for its coalmines, and it provided the fuel for two world wars, a cold war and eventually one of the most powerful economies in the world. But as Germany transformed, tough, physical labour remained the central tenet of life in cities like Gelsenkirchen. Between the end of the 19th century and the 1980s, the region produced €120 billion worth of coal, and since then it has been in decline. The evidence is easily seen in a city like Gelsenkirchen, but there remains an abiding respect for backbreaking labour – and an empathy for honest triers who toil in more sophisticated times. John O'Shea (second from right) scores a late equaliser for the Republic of Ireland against Germany . O'Shea celebrates his dramatic strike with team-mates Stephen Ward (second from right) and Jon Walters . Men like Stephen Quinn, Glenn Whelan and Jon Walters did not need lamps and soot-streaked faces to sync in with the culture of backbreaking labour that survives in cities like this one. Stadion Gelsenkirchen, the home of Schalke, is modern and appointed in the way one expects of a superior Bundesliga ground, but around it the city shrivels at the edges. Mining made this entire region live, and with the steady closure of pit after pit the tradition of honest, brutal labour survived only in folk memory – until Tuesday night. There must have been tough old men who watched on during this match and recognised more in the valiant attempts of the visitors than in the complex, rapid movements of their own world champions. There have been a number of attempts to try and connect the cities and clubs of this part of Germany with its past. During the summer, for instance, Schalke transformed the players' tunnel at their stadium. They changed the area that used to be decorated in the club colours of blue and white and instead turned it into a replica mineshaft. Walters (centre) attempts to hold off Erik Durm (left) and Matthias Ginter (right) in Gelsenkirchen . Germany's Julian Draxler (right) has an effort at goal under pressure from David Meyler (left) Colourful Germany fans pose for the cameras ahead of kick-off at the Veltins-Arena . Robbie Keane and Manuel Neuer led their teams through grey plastic modelled on the cold, dark tunnels which swallowed generations of German workers. It looked tacky but well meaning, and there is a virtue in reminding millionaire World Cup winners of the plain and sturdy lives many have lived. Toni Kroos, Mario Gotze and perpetual cry-baby Thomas Muller are more used to being confronted by uncomplicated hard work when facing opponents, but few rivals can have toiled against them the way Quinn, Whelan and Walters did. If the Germans are working through some wrinkles in getting used to life as champions of the world, they remain studies in close control and offensive movement. The Irish defenders – and 11 players were defenders here on Tuesday night – had to constantly reckon with an opponent darting into space, or a German moving the ball to a team-mate with an instant flick of his boot. They worked tight, intricate patterns and while David Forde was not having to fling himself the length of his goal time after time, from early on it was clear the home team needed to get lucky just once; eventually, a teasing Kroos pass or a bullet run from Gotze would get free. Germany midfielder Toni Kroos (No 18) score his side's goal with a fierce long-range drive . The World Cup holders celebrate Kroos' strike after 71 minutes in Germany . Ireland players (from left to right) Darron Gibson, Jeff Hendrick and Stephen Quinn appear dejected . VIDEO Loew frustrated by Ireland draw . That it took 70 minutes for this to happen must be down to the efforts of Ireland as much as the constant prompting of the German midfield. Quinn was the pick of the Irish triers in the first half, doing his best to unsettle the regal-looking Kroos. Whelan played deeper again, trying to fill as much space as possible in front of his central defenders as Germans swarmed around in buzzing arcs. Walters was the closest thing to an Irish avenue of escape from their half. He started the game on the right side of five midfielders, and was targeted regularly by Forde from kick-outs. German left-back Erik Durm is said to be clumsy and is regularly criticised, but he is a big man and happily signed up for an evening of flinging himself against the Stoke forward. He was shellacked with criticism for his non-role in defending the second Polish goal on Saturday, but even aristocrats need labourers and it was he who blocked the late shot of Wes Hoolahan. Three minutes before half time, Walters ran over to the sideline for a drink of water during an interruption to play. Roy Keane jumped up off his seat in the dugout and beckoned Walters over for some advice. After quick words Walters turned and trudged back for more labour. He had got his brief glimpse of daylight and it was back down to the coalface then. Midfielder Stephen Quinn (bottom) slides in on Germany's Karim Bellarabi with a strong tackle . For a small period in the second half, maybe just five minutes, Germany looked frustrated and rushed and perhaps a little lost. The ball ricocheted between home and away midfielders and they looked no more in control of the match than the men of Martin O'Neill did. However, Ireland appeared to be emptying themselves just to survive. Turning the game into a mess was absorbing a tremendous amount of energy, evidenced by the substation of Quinn and the injury to Whelan that saw him taken off as well. Jeff Hendrick and Darron Gibson took their places, with O'Neill recognising the need for a cuter side to Ireland's game after going 1-0 down when introducing Hoolahan. He made the stadium shake with fright when reaching McClean's shot before Durm slid in and intercepted, but Ireland's effort was a limited one, as necessitated by resources. The old ways are honourable but people here would have told you before 10pm on a Tuesday evening in October that they are helpless against the smartest ideas of the modern world. There are a score of background reasons why Germany should always be better than Ireland, like tradition and population and finance. These disparities should emerge on the field, when 11 take on 11 but one team is sourced in the slickest practices money can buy and the other must rely on more basic principles. There is a nobility to honest effort – and sometimes it can withstand the creep of the new. Old men who can just about remember when this part of Germany was rich and powerful know that now, thanks to John O'Shea.","John O'Shea scored in added time to secure a 1-1 draw against Germany .

"A woman who cheated death in the Brazilian nightclub fire after making a last-minute decision to stay at home was killed a week later in a freak road accident, it was reported today. Jessica de Lima Rohl, 21, helped organise the party for university students at the Kiss nightclub in Santa Maria, south Brazil, and sold tickets for the event. But as she was getting ready to leave her home on the night of the doomed freshers' ball which left 238 dead, her boyfriend called asking for her not to go. Tragic: Jessica de Lima Rohl, 21, helped organise the party for university students at the Kiss nightclub in Santa Maria, south Brazil, and died a week later in a car crash . Miss de Lima Rohl travelled to the town of Toledo, where her boyfriend Mr Stefanel had been working, and both were killed in a crash. This is the remains of the VW Golf they were travelling . Despite most of her friends being at the event, agribusiness student Miss de Lima Rohl listened to the pleas of 20-year-old Adriano Stefanel - who was living in another town - and stayed at home. Hours later flames would rip through the packed club after a band member lit a firework on stage which ignited the club's foam roof. Many died after inhaling toxic fumes while others were crushed in a battle to escape the blaze in the early hours of January 27 -  the worst nightclub fire in more than a decade. Mr Stefanel's father Nilton, 48, who lives in the town of Silveira Martins, near Santa Maria, told Brazil's Terra website: 'He probably had a feeling about something and he asked for her not to go, and she ended up not going. 'In the early morning of Sunday morning he called home in desperation, crying, having heard about the tragedy, asking if his 16-year-old sister had gone to the club, but she also had decided to stay at home. 'Jessica was so happy and thankful for having listened to his advice. From that moment she regarded him as her guardian angel, and he felt like a hero for having saved somebody.' The moment the band Gurizada Fandangueria, famed for their use of on . stage pyrotechnics, let off a flare which is believed to . have started the fire at Kiss Club in Santa Maria . Horrific: A crowd stands outside the Kiss nightclub as the nightmare unfolded . Aftermath: A view from inside the Kiss nightclub in Santa Maria after the blaze . Firefighters battled to put out the fire which tore through the Kiss Club in Santa Maria, southern Brazil . 30,000 people from Brazil's Santa Maria . held a commemorative march through the city and back to Kiss . nightclub where the disaster happened . A day later Mr Stefanel posted a message to those who had lost loved ones in the tragedy in the town. It read: 'After what happened in Santa Maria, so many people I knew lost their lives. To those who are still here, thank God and pray for those people who have gone, and for their families that they will have the strength to get over such a great loss.' On Thursday, Miss de Lima Rohl travelled to the town of Toledo, where Mr Stefanel had been working, and the two planned to return together to Santa Maria by car on Saturday night - a distance of 82 miles. But according to police the couple had driven just a few metres when their Volkswagon Golf collided head-on with a truck. Miss de Lima Rohl died instantly, and Mr Stefanel - who would have turned 21 the next day - died later in hospital. His devastated father Nilton said: 'He would always be calling us saying he felt alone and that he wanted to come back home as soon as he found a job here. Now he has come back, but in a different way. 'When a person's mission here on earth comes to an end, whether in a nightclub, or on the road, or where ever, when their destiny doesn't give them another way out, there's nothing left for us to do but accept the will of God.' He added that the bodies of both Miss de Lima Rohl and Mr Stefanel are to be buried together in Mr Stefanel's hometown of Silveira Martins. 'It was Jessica's own family who requested it,' he said.","Jessica de Lima Rohl helped organise party at nightclub in Santa Maria .

"Labour MP John Mann said he handed evidence of 'abuse parties' over in 1998 but claims the case was closed within three months by Scotland Yard . Police were told a Cabinet minister and prominent MPs were abusing children 26 years ago at a block of luxury flats used by politicians but nothing was done, a senior MP revealed yesterday. Fears of a cover-up of an Establishment paedophile ring deepened last night as an MP said he handed over evidence in 1988 of ‘abuse parties’ at Dolphin Square and other London locations, but an investigation was shelved by Scotland Yard. Labour’s John Mann said the case was closed within three months on the orders of ‘those at the top’. His revelation came as it emerged that police are probing disturbing reports of three murders linked to the alleged VIP paedophile ring in the 1970s and 1980s. A victim has claimed he saw a Conservative MP strangle a 12-year-old boy to death at an ‘abuse party’ in a Central London townhouse around 1980. The witness, known only as Nick, says a Tory Cabinet minister watched two men kill a second boy in a depraved sexual assault a year later. He has also told police he saw a boy of ten or 11 being run over in broad daylight. The extraordinary allegations come just days after Scotland Yard announced it was setting up a new inquiry, Operation Midland, to investigate ‘possible homicides’ more than 30 years ago linked to a child abuse network said to involve senior politicians, spy chiefs, prominent military and legal figures. But yesterday Mr Mann claimed the Metropolitan Police knew back in 1988 that these sex parties were happening and did nothing to stop them. As a young councillor investigating corruption in his local borough of Lambeth, Mr Mann uncovered evidence that a Tory Cabinet minister and other serving politicians were sexually abusing children taken from care homes to Dolphin Square, a luxury riverside estate in Pimlico which has been home to dozens of MPs. He reported his concerns to Lambeth police, but told the Mail: ‘I was told in 1989 by local police that they were very unhappy but they had been instructed to stop the investigation by someone at the top of the police.’ Scotland Yard has announced it is setting up a new inquiry, Operation Midland, to investigate ‘possible homicides’ more than 30 years ago linked to an abuse network said to involve politicians and leading figures . In July this year, it emerged that a 40-page dossier on suspected Establishment paedophiles compiled by the late Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens and sent to then Home Secretary Leon Brittan in 1983 had vanished. A recent Home Office inquiry into its whereabouts failed to uncover the files and Home Secretary Theresa May said she could not rule out a possible cover-up. Tom Watson, the Labour MP who first raised the alarm in 2012 at Prime Minister’s Questions when he said a paedophile ring was linked to ‘Parliament and No 10’, called for a national police inquiry. ‘The allegations of cruelty, torture and murder are truly shocking, and go far beyond the case that I raised with the Prime Minister two years ago,’ he said. ‘The public will be deeply concerned, which is why it is vital the police quickly establish the facts. ‘They are such disturbing allegations that I have no doubt that the resources will be found to conduct a thorough investigation.’ 'Abuse parties': Dolphin Square in London . The man whose allegations of VIP sex parties are at the centre of a police inquiry last night claimed to have witnessed a boy being murdered by a Tory MP. Known only as ‘Nick’, the witness said the horrifying experience of being assaulted by an alleged VIP paedophile ring of MPs, spy chiefs, military and legal officials had haunted his life. Around 1980, he recalls being driven by a chauffeur to a luxury London townhouse with a terrified 12-year-old boy who he claims was then strangled to death by a Tory MP. The man told the Sunday People: ‘I knew we were being taken somewhere to be sexually abused by powerful men. But I had no idea of the true horror of what was about to happen.’ He also claims a Tory Cabinet minister and another Tory MP raped him and other boys aged between ten and 14, who were chauffeur-driven to parties across London in luxury cars. One of the addresses where the alleged parties took place was in Dolphin Square, a prestigious Pimlico complex popular with MPs. Nick believes he was taken there at least ten times for ‘abuse parties’ between 1975 and 1984. In 1979, he says he saw an unknown member of the paedophile gang run over a boy of ten or 11 in south-west London as a ‘warning’ to other victims not to speak out. Then, in 1981, he alleges a third child was murdered in front of a Tory Cabinet minister. After received counselling for the abuse he suffered, Nick contacted the Exaro investigative website in May before deciding to go to police. His claims are being investigated by Scotland Yard.","MP John Mann said he handed evidence of 'abuse parties' to police in 1998 .

"Crammed into wire mesh boxes the size of coffins, these are the penniless people forced to live like animals in one of the world's richest cities. Hong Kong's forgotten 'caged dogs' pay about HK$1,500 a year (£117) to live in a city whose small size and high population pushes the rent on even a tiny flat far out of the reach of its poorest residents. The poverty-stricken people keep their clothes and photos of loved ones next to filthy blankets in their cages, which measure 6ft long and between 2 1/2 ft and 3ft wide and are stacked on top of each other. Some of them cannot stretch their legs out straight and are forced to sleep curled up in a ball. Life in a cage: Yan Chi Keung, 57, reads the newspaper in his cage home in Hong Kong. The wire mesh boxes are 6ft long and up to 3ft wide and cost £117 a year, compared to £1,240 a month for a small, privately-rented one-bedroom apartment. More than 220,000 people are on the housing waiting list . Caged dogs: Retired Kong Sui Kao, 64, lives in this cage in a cramped room alongside seventeen other people on the roof of a 12-storey block. His underwear hangs on a coat hanger, his shirts are inside the cage and his meagre possessions are stored on a makeshift shelf above his feet . Retired manual labourer, 79-year-old Tai Lun Po, has lived in his cage home for 30 years. The inhabitants are stacked on top of each other in damp, dark conditions .

He found one of the illegal iron and timber shanties perched on the rooftop . of a 12-storey apartment block in the downtown district of Kowloon, on . the peninsula opposite the main city centre on Hong Kong Island. 'The atmosphere inside is hot, dark, intense and unfriendly', he said. 'As . I first arrived in the corridor outside, I could hear the landlord . inside yelling at the residents; I beat a retreat and returned later.' With . a population of more than 7 million, about the same as London, the . wealthy former British colony has an area of just 426 square miles which puts prices at a premium. A small one-bedroom apartment costs about HK$16,000 (£1,240) a month. The . caged homes began in the 1950s and 1960s when a baby boom and an influx . of Chinese migrants saw Hong Kong's population soar by more than a . million. But there were just a few thousand cages until the 1990s, when the estimated number soared to a peak of 100,000 in 1997.

"An 18-year-old man has died after an off-duty police officer shot at him 17 times - just miles from where unarmed teen Michael Brown was gunned down by a cop in August. Police said that Vonderrit Myers Jr. first opened fire on the unidentified 32-year-old officer in Shaw, Missouri, which is less than 10 miles from Ferguson, where Brown was shot dead on August 9. The officer, who is a six-year veteran of the force, was in a car working a secondary job for a private security company and paroling the area when he saw three males in the street and thought they were acting suspiciously, St Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson said in a press conference. Scroll down for videos . Killed: Vonderrit Myers Jr., pictured left with his mother and right, was shot dead by an off-duty police officer on Wednesday night. Police said he fled when approached by the officer and a fight ensued . Crime scene: A crowd gathers near the scene at Shaw Boulevard where the teen was fatally shot on Wednesday - just miles from where unarmed teenager Michael Brown was shot by a cop in August . Anger: Crowds confront police near the scene in south St. Louis after the 32-year-old officer killed the teen . As he approached them, one of them started to run away, so the officer did a U-turn and then all three ran, Dotson said, the St Louis Post-Dispatch reported. 'One of them ran in a way that the officer believed that he was armed with a gun – holding his waist band, not running at full stride,' Dotson said, referring to Myers. The officer, who was wearing a Metropolitan Police Department uniform, jumped out of his car and chased them on foot before getting into a scuffle with Myers, who reached for his gun, Dotson said. Myers shot at least three times at the officer, who then returned fire - and when the teenager tried to fire again, his gun jammed, Dotson said. Dispute: Myers, pictured, was just buying a sandwich before he was chased and shot dead, his family said . Authorities said Myers, in white, was known to them and was wearing a monitoring device on his ankle as part of the bail conditions for a previous arrest for gun charges. He was due to go on trial in November . Street fight: Cops say that the teen shot at the off-duty office first and then he shot back, killing him . The officer, a white male, then fired 17 times at the teenager - but it is not yet known how many times he was struck and Dotson said he doesn't know why he fired so many times. He died from his injuries. Police recovered a 9mm Ruger at the scene, he said. The officer was working for Hi-Tech Security, which employs several St. Louis police officers in secondary jobs. He was patrolling the neighborhood on behalf of the company rather than the Metropolitan Police Department but was wearing his police officer's uniform. He has been placed on administrative leave and an investigation is underway. He was not hurt. Dotson said that the 18-year-old was 'no stranger to law enforcement', the St Louis Post-Dispatch reported. He was wearing an ankle bracelet at the time as a condition of bail in a gun case, according to his lawyer and police, the Post-Dispatch reported. The newspaper reported that Myers was due in court in November for unlawful use of a weapon and resisting arrest after he allegedly ditched a gun after jumping from a car that had been involved in a high-speed chase. Backup: The 32-year-old officer, who has not been identified, was not on duty when he shot the boy . Protest: People at the scene put up their hands, like the protesters who showed they were not armed in the aftermath of the killing of Michael Brown. Protests still continue in the area following that death in August . Police caught him nearby and recovered the loaded .380-caliber pistol he had allegedly dropped. He was jailed for a few days before being released on $1,000 cash bond and fitted with an electronic monitoring device. He was allowed to leave his home for work, school, court appearances, meetings with attorneys and meetings with the private monitoring firm, the Post-Dispatch reported. His family said he was still in high school and disputed police claims that he was armed. 'He was unarmed,' said his cousin, Teyonna Myers, to the Post-Dispatch. 'He had a sandwich in his hand, and they thought it was a gun. It’s like Michael Brown all over again.' The boy's uncle, Jackie Williams, also says he is not buying the story being told by police. 'My nephew was coming out of a store from purchasing a sandwich. Security was supposedly searching for someone else. They Tased him,' Williams said. 'I don’t know how this happened, but they went off and shot him 16 times. That’s outright murder.' Nearby: The incident unfolded less than 10 miles from where Michael brown (above) was killed in Ferguson . Officers are claiming they recovered a gun at the scene and that the officer did not have a Taser. Another man, Lavell Boyd, who lives in the neighborhood, claimed to hear as many as 15 shots fired. 'When I pulled up I saw the cop standing over him [Myers] then he pointed the gun at everyone else telling everyone to get back while he was searching for another clip,' Boyd said. News of the death quickly spread across social media and sparked more protests in the street - just the latest outcry after the death of Michael Brown. David Carson, a photographer for the Post-Dispatch, reports that protesters filled the streets near where the shooting happened and have been chanting 'Black lives matter.' Some also vandalized a police SUV as they chanted 'F*** the police.' It comes just days after St. Louis Cardinals fans were seen screaming racial insults at protesters in the city.","An off-duty police officer, who has not been identified, shot and killed high school student Vonderrit Myers Jr. last night in Shaw, Missouri .

"You may think hair extensions were created for the feisty, fake-tan bearing women of today – but they were in fact being flaunted by Egyptian women more than 3,000 years ago. The pieces were elaborate creations, with one recently uncovered in an Egyptian coffin made up of 70 elaborate extensions fastened together. The owner of the hair piece had her body wrapped in a mat, but her name, age and occupation remain a mystery to archaeologists. Scrll down for video . The owner of the hair piece had her body wrapped in a mat, but her name, age and occupation remain a mystery to archaeologists . The skull was one of hundreds found in the ancient city of Amarna, many of which had their final hairstyles incredibly well-preserved using fat. One skull had extensions made of grey and dark black hair suggesting a number of different people donated their hair to create the piece. However, the latest intricate design of hair extension has left researchers on the Amarna Project baffled. 'Whether or not the woman had her hair styled like this for her burial only is one of our main research questions,' Jolanda Bos, an archaeologist working on the Amarna Project, told Owen Jarus at Live Science . 'Whether or not the woman had her hair styled like this for her burial only is one of our main research questions,' Jolanda Bos (pictured), an archaeologist working on the Amarna Project, told Live Science . This skull was one of hundreds found in the ancient city of Amarna, many of which had their final hairstyles incredibly well-preserved using fat . Ancient Egyptians used hair gel to style their locks in everyday life, researchers have found. A study several years ago of male and female mummies has found fashion-conscious Egyptians made use of a fat-based product to keep their hair in place. They used the styling gel on both long and short hair, tried to curl their hair with tongs and even plaited it in hair extensions to lengthen their tresses. It is thought they used these methods in both life and death, with corpses being styled to make sure they looked good in the afterlife. The incredible discovery was made by archaeological scientists who studied hair samples of 18 male and female mummies, aged from four to 58 years old. Using light and electron microscopes, they found that nine of the mummies had coated their hair in the fatty substance, which is thought to be a beauty product. Bizarrely, even in the artificially-preserved bodies the hair did not contain resins or embalming materials, suggesting the hair was styled separately to the mummification process. 'The hair was most likely styled after death, before a person was buried. 'It is also likely, however, that these hairstyles were used in everyday life as well and that the people in Amarna used hair extensions in their daily life.' Out of 100 skulls analysed, 28 still had hair. The type of hair ranged from curly black to light brown and curly, suggesting some ethnic diversity in the region. Skulls with in tact hair often had curls around their ears, and many also had braids. One skull had extensions made of grey and dark black hair suggesting a number of different people donated their hair to create the piece . 'All braids found in the coiffures were simple and of three strands, mostly 0.4 inches wide, with strands of approximately 0.2 inches (5mm) when tightly braided,' Ms Bos writes in the journal article. People at Amarna also liked to keep their hair short. 'Braids were often not more than 7.9 inches (20cm) long, leaving the hair at shoulder length approximately,' Ms Bos added. And it appears ancient Egyptian women used a similar technique to hide their greys. Some of the skulls shows evidence of a dye, possibly henna, used on hair. Out of 100 skulls analysed, 28 still had hair. The type of hair ranged from curly black to light brown and curly, suggesting some ethnic diversity in the region.

"An enraged mob of anti-American protesters shouting 'Yankee, go home!' and 'Damn America' were caught on video roughing up three unarmed US Navy sailors Wednesday in Istanbul. The tense confrontation took place near where the sailors' warship, the USS Ross, was docked on an inlet of the Bosphorus Strait in the Black Sea. A dozen or more members of the nationalist group Youth Association of Turkey (TGB) hurled insults at the American servicemen, calling them killers and saying they should get out of Turkey. Scroll down for video . Under attack: Three unarmed US Navy sailors were attacked by a group of anti-American protesters in Istanbul Wednesday . Violent protest: Youth Association of Turkey (TGB) members shouted at the American servicemen, calling them killers and said they should get out of Turkey. At one point, the verbal abuse turned physical . Rage: One of the activists hurled a rock at a bespectacled sailor carrying a backpack . The protesters, who at one point unfurled a TGB banner emblazoned with Turkish founding father Mustafa Kemal Ataturk's image, threw red paint at the sailors, pelted them with rocks, shoved them around and briefly succeeded in putting white sacks over their heads. AFP reported that the use of white bags was a reference to an incident from 2003 when US forces in northern Iraq arrested a group of Turkish soldiers, placed hoods over their heads and detained them for three days. The incident stirred strong nationalist sentiment in Turkey and was dramatized in the 2006 Turkish blockbuster Valley of the Wolves: Iraq. 'Soldiers from the occupying country think they can walk around freely in Eminonu,' association spokesman Melik Dibek said, referring to the neighborhood where the incident occurred. 'It's obvious why they've anchored here —because of their ambitions in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. American imperialism is the reason why the Middle East has turned into a chamber of fire.' Capt. Greg Hicks, a spokesman for the US European Command, said the Navy men, who were in plainclothes, were not hurt and were safely back aboard the guide-missile destroyer docked nearby, but that shore leave for its sailors was canceled for the remainder of the day. The US Embassy in Ankara condemned the attack on Twitter and said it had no doubt that most Turks would reject such an action. 'The video showing an assault on three visiting American sailors is appalling,' the multi-part statement read.  'While we respect the right to peaceful protest and freedom of expression, we condemn today’s attack in Istanbul, and have no doubt the vast majority of Turks would join us in rejecting an action that so disrespects Turkey’s reputation for hospitality.' TGB members accused the sailors of being agents of American imperialism and meddling in regional affairs . A video of the tense confrontation was recorded by the protesters and shared online . Hooded: The nationalists briefly succeeded in putting white sacks over their heads . Payback: The use of white bags was a reference to an incident from 2003 when US forces in northern Iraq arrested a group of Turkish soldiers and placed hoods over their heads . Dogan news agency said Turkish police have detained 12 people, including one woman, in connection with the incident . The US Navy also addressed the incident in a statement posted online Wednesday saying that US Embassy staff are investigating the attack on the sailors. 'We have enjoyed a strong relationship with Turkey for many years,' read the statement from US 6th Fleet. 'As NATO allies, we share common interests, and this incident will not diminish that strong relationship. 'Turkish ports have long been very popular destinations for U.S. Navy ships, and our Sailors have enjoyed the warm hospitality that has traditionally been extended.' Anti-American sentiment in Turkey is not widespread, but some Turks accuse the United States of meddling in regional affairs. Escaped unharmed: US Navy officials said the three sailors were not hurt in the scuffle . US Navy and US Embassy staff in Turkey have condemned the violent attack on American sailors . In hot pursuit: The angry mob chased the outnumbered sailors down the street, shouting 'Yankee, go home!' In Washington, Col. Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, called the attack 'ugly and disturbing.' He said the attackers, whom he called street thugs, 'bring great discredit upon the Turks and the Turkish reputation for hospitality.' He said the assault 'appears to be a one-off incident' and that he doesn't believe it will disrupt US-Turkish relations. The Navy said it would continue to coordinate with Turkish authorities to review security procedures for future ship visits. Shore leave: The sailors were from the USS Ross, which was docked on an inlet of the Bosphorus Strait in the Black Sea . Dogan news agency said Turkish police have detained 12 people, including one woman, in connection with the incident. One sailor, a bespectacled young man in a brown jacket,tried to ignore the protesters to no avail. Another worked unsuccessfully to push off the protesters. When the sailors couldn't get away, they began to walk and then run away down a sidewalk. A video of the incident shot by the association and posted online showed the protesters chasing them down the street, shouting 'Yankee, go home!'

Calum Wilson, a British expat born and raised in Hong Kong who attended the protests in London, told MailOnline: 'We are here to show support to the protesters in Hong Kong. 'I think the main conversation on this issue is taking place in Hong Kong, but I'm here because I think it's important to show the international community care about this issue and are watching how Hong Kong government and china deal with the situation. 'It's really just to bring attention to the important issue of democracy.' The protests in London and Manchester were among more than 25 demonstrations around the world yesterday arranged in support of ongoing pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. In Manchester (left) demonstrators addressed the crowd using loudhailers and volunteers showed videos of the protests from Hong Kong on their laptop screens (right) Anger: Hundreds of people also gathered in Piccadilly Gardens in central Manchester in a show of support for those on the streets of the former British colony . Mirroring the actions of those in Hong Kong, the protesters in Manchester sat on the ground peacefully and held aloft placards and lights on their mobile phones . The organisation United for Democracy: Global Solidarity with Hong Kong said protests were planned yesterday for Auckland, Edinburgh, Houston, Christchurch, Hamburg, Melbourne, Seattle, Taipei, Oslo, Montreal, Seoul, Paris, Toronto, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Washington and Boston. Thousands of people have taken to the streets in the Asian financial hub in the last week after China said it would vet candidates for a leadership election in 2017. In China, an editorial in People’s Daily warned of ‘unimaginable consequences’ if the protests continued, while state TV said Hong Kong’s police should be supported in their attempts to ‘restore the social order as soon as possible’. Former governor Chris Patten yesterday accused China of breaking the promises it made before the handover of Hong Kong, as protests in the former British colony reached a peak. He said dialogue ‘must replace tear gas and pepper spray’ and that the current situation represented ‘a breach of what the Chinese government have promised Hong Kong’. Shared anger: Protesters gathered in New York's Times Square held aloft yellow umbrellas, the symbol of the movement for democracy in the former colony . The rally in Times Square (pictured) was among others organised yesterday in Auckland, Edinburgh, Houston, Christchurch, Hamburg, Melbourne, Seattle, Taipei, Oslo, Montreal, Seoul, Paris, Toronto, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Washington and Boston according to the group United for Democracy: Global Solidarity with Hong Kong . Warning: Protesters in New York gave a taste of what they feared the future could hold in placards comparing the island territory to Tibet . Chants: Protesters in New York. Others around the world have taken to chanting Do You Hear the People Sing, the revolutionary theme from the musical Les Miserables . Protests: In Times Square, the umbrella-holding demonstrators were illuminated in the night by the area's famous digital billboards advertising Western goods . New York Support: Hundreds gathered in Times Square on Wednesday  to rally in support of Hong Kong's Umbrella Revolution and are demanding an end to violent police repression of Hong Kong democracy activists occupying central areas of the city . Umbrella revolution: People hold up customized umbrellas during a rally in New York's Times Square on Wednesday and students bearing umbrellas as a sign of solidarity gathered at rallies in several U.S. cities to show support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong . Umbrella for peace: Protesters gathered in New York on Wednesday to share their anger with Hong Kong's violent police repression . The demonstrators have been thronging the streets of Hong Kong for the last six days to protest against China’s demands to vet the candidates for a 2017 leadership election. The protests are the worst in Hong Kong since China resumed its rule and pose one of the biggest political challenges for Beijing since it violently crushed pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989. Lord Patten said the protesters were merely standing up for what they were promised in the territory’s Basic Law, which was drafted in accordance with an agreement on Hong Kong between Britain and China in 1984, ahead of the 1997 handover. ‘They said these matters were within the autonomy of the Hong Kong government and they are now reneging on that,’ he told the BBC. ‘In the Basic Law and in the promises that people were given, it’s absolutely clear that the pace of democratisation is a matter for the Hong Kong government. ‘It is described as being within Hong Kong’s “high degree of autonomy”. It is absolutely absurd to say that this is all decided by the authorities in Beijing.’ Lord Patten said he believed earlier Hong Kong leaders had probably failed to make Beijing aware of the strength of pro-democracy feeling. Symbolic: Hundreds of people gathered in front of Liberty Square in Taipei, Taiwan, to show their support for the pro-democracy rallies taking place in Hong Kong . The protests around the world have been largely peaceful, and organisers said they were intended to make a powerful statement to the Chinese government . Messages: Student Harmony So, originally from Hong Kong, uses tape to secure colourful post-it notes to Hong Kong House yesterday in Sydney, Australia . Stark: The messages left in Sydney referenced the harsh treatment of protesters by the Chinese government with the slogan: 'They can't kill us all' Massacre: Protesters in Manchester. The former colony's last governor Lord Patten said the protesters were merely standing up for what they were promised in the territory’s Basic Law, which was drafted in accordance with an agreement on Hong Kong between Britain and China in 1984, ahead of the 1997 handover . Dedication: The protesters in Manchester remained in the square as dusk fell, wearing yellow ribbons and carrying yellow umbrellas, symbols of the movement . But he dismissed fears of direct Chinese intervention and the possibility of another Tiananmen Square massacre. ‘I cannot believe that the Chinese leadership would be so crazy,’ he said. ‘I can’t believe that they would act in such a brutal and immoral way. ‘I cannot believe it would be so stupid as to do anything like send in the army.’ He added: ‘I think in order to save face for Beijing and for the Hong Kong government, the right thing to do is to embark on a new period of consultation, make it genuine consultation, because there are a lot of very moderate people on the pro-democracy side.’ Riot police had used tear gas, pepper spray and baton charges at the weekend to try to quell the unrest, but tensions have eased since. Many had feared police would use force to move crowds before yesterday’s celebrations marking the anniversary of the foundation of the People’s Republic of China in 1949. Epicentre: Protesters in Hong Kong. Many warned they would escalate the demonstrations later today by occupying government buildings if demands were not met . Flood: Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Hong Kong once again last night, holding smartphone lights aloft against the skyline of the business hub . No room to move: The demonstrators have occupied every square inch of pavement and road in the city of 7million people and warned the protests could escalate . Building bridges: The people have called on the Chinese government to allow a more accountable, democratic system and elect leaders by way of universal suffrage . Injustice: Hong Kong residents have long felt their island stood apart from mainland China thanks to enhanced civil liberties and separate legal and financial systems . Dawn breaks: Some student protesters stayed on the streets of Hong Kong through to this morning, taking shelter from the elements in tents on the pavement . Security officials in Beijing have also been accused accused of using sophisticated malware technology to glean information from protesters communicating with iPhones and iPads. When China took control of Hong Kong in 1997, it agreed to a policy of 'one country, two systems' which allowed it a high degree of control over its own affairs and kept in place liberties unseen on the mainland. It also promised that the city's leader would eventually be chosen through universal suffrage, and Hong Kong residents have long felt their island stood apart from mainland China thanks to those civil liberties and separate legal and financial systems.","Organisers said 3,000 people gathered outside the Chinese embassy in central London with more in Manchester .

"Fears are growing that the deadly Ebola virus has hit a new continent as a missionary in Brazil undergoes tests for the infection. If the Brazilian case is confirmed, it would mean the disease has spread to South America for the first time. The suspected patient is a 47-year-old man from Guinea, one of the African countries that has been ravaged by the disease. Scroll down for video . An ambulance moves the first suspected Ebola patient in Brazil to an airport so he can travel to Rio de Janeiro for further treatment . He has been described in local media as a missionary and he was taken in an airforce plane from the southern state of Parana to the National Infectious Disease Institute in Rio de Janeiro on Friday morning. It came after he arrived at a health centre in the town of Cascavel with a fever the previous afternoon. The health ministry said today that the patient was 'in good shape' and his slight fever had now subsided. Minister Arthur Chioro noted that the patient had been in Brazil for the maximum incubation period for the Ebola virus of 21 days. The result of a test for the virus should be available by early Saturday, he said. The 47-year-old man, originally from Guinea will be taken to the Brazilian National Infectious Diseases Institute in Rio, pictured . 'We could not rule out (Ebola), even though it had been 20 days, given the fever and the patient's origin,' Mr Chioro told journalists in Brasilia. The man, who has not been named, is thought to have arrived in Brazil from Africa on September 19 from the Guinean capital Conakry after flying to Argentina, with a layover in Morocco, then travelled overland to Brazil, seeking refugee status. The patients who were in the clinic with have also been isolated and the site disinfected, said radio network CBN. It is thought he is suffering from symptoms similar to those of Ebola and is being moved to Rio de Janeiro for treatment. It is not yet confirmed if he has Ebola. Meanwhile French medics have established that an unnamed woman in Paris has tested negative for Ebola. The Bichat Hospital in Paris where an unnamed woman has been placed in sterilised isolation after fears she may have Ebola. She eventually tested negative for Ebola . It comes as the British government ordered airports and Eurostar terminals to quiz passengers arriving from West Africa in an attempt to prevent Ebola entering the UK. But experts have told MailOnline 'shutting borders will not stop Ebola', as leading experts say the key to tackling the vicious virus is 'rooting it out' at the source, in West Africa. The woman had been undergoing tests at the Bichat Hospital and had been placed in a sterilised isolation room. Passengers arrive at Heathrow Airport with one wearing a face mask as increased screening for Ebola begins. The checks will be carried out at Heathrow, Gatwick and Eurostar terminals . But France’s health minister Marisol Touraine today said that tests on a suspected Ebola sufferer had proved negative. The unnamed female American patient had been travelling in Africa, said Ms Touraine, but she was not suffering from the fatal disease. 'There have been no cases of Ebola in France, and this remains the case,' added Ms Touraine. The new suspected cases come after authorities in Taiwan also tested a Nigerian woman for Ebola after she was showing symptoms of the fatal virus after arriving at an airport in the country. However, it was revealed earlier today that she tested negative Ebola and reportedly had a history of malaria. The condition of Spanish nurse, Teresa Romero, the first to have contracted Ebola outside Africa has remained stable . Meanwhile, the condition of a Spanish nurse with Ebola today remained stable as she lay gravely ill in a Madrid hospital. Teresa Romero, 44, is the first person to have contracted Ebola outside of Africa, after becoming infected by a Spanish priest repatriated from Africa with the disease as she treated him at the Carlos III Hospital. Yesterday seven people turned themselves in to an Ebola isolation unit in Madrid, where Mrs Romero is being cared for. The seven new admissions included two hairdressers who had given her a beauty treatment before she was diagnosed with Ebola, and hospital staff who had treated the 44-year-old nurse . Doctors wearing protective suits can be seen inside the Carlos III hospital in Madrid, where Mrs Romero is being treated . A sanitation worker wearing protective clothing begins to disinfect the apartment building where the Spanish nurse was staying before she tested positive for the virus . A hospital spokeswoman said there were now 14 people in the isolation unit on its sealed-off sixth floor, including Romero, her husband, and health workers who had cared for Romero since she was admitted on Monday. Spanish labour unions accused the government of seeking to deflect the blame onto Mrs Romero for the failings of its health system, after the European Union asked Spain to explain how the virus could have been spread on a high-security ward. The top regional health official in Madrid, Javier Rodriguez, has said Mrs Romero took too long to admit she had made a mistake by touching her face with the glove of her protective suit while taking it off. In a radio interview he said: 'She has taken days to recognise that she may have made a mistake when taking off the suit. If she had said it earlier, it would have saved a lot of work. But the nurse's brother Jose Ramon told the newspaper El Pais: 'They will find any way to blame her. Basically, my sister did her job ... and she has become infected with Ebola.' The British government have ordered airports to quiz passengers arriving from West Africa in an attempt to prevent Ebola entering the UK. Pictured, a health agent checks the temperature of a passenger leaving Liberia at the Roberts International Airport near Monrovia . The Ebola virus causes fever, vomiting and diarrhoea and sometimes internal bleeding, and is spread through direct contact with body fluids. About half of those infected in West Africa have died. The World Health Organisation say around 3,600 people have died from the infection during the current outbreak. But experts have warned that shutting borders will not stop Ebola from spreading. Dr Ben Neuman, a virologist at the University of Reading, told MailOnline: 'Shutting borders will not stop Ebola, you have to root it out.' He added: 'The longer this goes on the more likely it is we may see a case in the UK. 'But the UK deals with things like this  effectively, they (the authorities) handle it. 'They are ready enough and have the capacity. There are a lot of doctors and nurses here who have been out there (to West Africa) with Doctors Without Borders, and so who have Ebola experience, which is invaluable.' It comes just hours after Michael Fallon  appealed for calm over threat of virus reaching the UK. Pictured are Liberian Red Cross burial volunteers praying before collecting the body of an Ebola victim . Meanwhile Professor Robert Dingwall, a specialist in health policy responses to infectious diseases at Nottingham Trent University accused the US of 'gesture politics', by introducing temperature screening at five airports. He told MailOnline: 'Controls are costly to enforce, inconvenience people and disrupt economic activity while having little or no impact on the spread of infections.' Experts say the most effective method of tackling the outbreak is to direct resources and funds to fighting the disease in West Africa, welcoming news the UK has vowed to deploy 750 soldiers and a medical warship to Sierra Leone. With Ebola cases already seen in Spain and the US, ministers have admitted it is 'entirely possible' the deadly virus will enter the UK 'by one route or another'. Airport screening of people leaving airports in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea has been in place for several weeks. Up to 750 British troops are being sent to Sierra Leone, where volunteers have been pictured picking up the bodes of Ebola victims . Health experts have pleaded that anyone with symptoms do not visit their GP or A&E for fear of spreading the disease . Official figures from the US Centre for Disease Control found in the last two months since exit screening began in three countries, 77 people from 36,000 screened were denied boarding a flight over health concerns. None of the 77 passengers were diagnosed with Ebola, though many were diagnosed as having malaria. Professor Dingwall said screening is ineffective because 'many diseases have a fairly lengthy incubation period and the infection cannot be passed on until the symptoms appear'. He told MailOnline: 'In this case, Ebola has an incubation period of up to 21 days. Health workers collect samples from the body of a person suspected to have died from Ebola on the street in Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone . Volunteers spray themselves with disinfectant after coming into contact with victims in Sierra Leone .","47-year-old man who travelled to Brazil is undergoing tests for Ebola .

"A ferry with nearly 700 people aboard has sunk near the central Philippine port of Cebu after colliding with a cargo vessel, killing at least 17 people. Hundreds of others were rescued. The captain of the ferry MV Thomas Aquinas ordered the ship to be abandoned after it began listing and then sank after hitting the cargo vessel, coastguard officer Joy Villegas said. The coastguard said 17 people were confirmed dead, including children, and 525 had been rescued several hours after the collision. Authorities were still checking the number of others who had been taken to hospitals. Scroll down for video . Urgent care: A medic carries rescued three-month old Trisia Mae Kumaro along with her mother (back) after they were rescued from a sea collision in Cebu, central Philippines . Panic: Survivors lying on a truck are assisted by a medical team to a hospital after they were rescued from a passenger vessel MV St Thomas Aquinas before it sank . Two coastguard vessels and other nearby ships were involved in the rescue operation not far from the port of Cebu, Mr Villegas said. Hundreds of passengers jumped into the ocean as the ship started to sink, according to survivors. Many of the passengers were asleep and others struggled to find their way in the dark. Jerwin Agudong said he and other passengers jumped overboard in front of the cargo vessel after the ferry began taking on water and the crew distributed life jackets. He told radio station DZBB that some people were trapped and he saw bodies in the water. ""It seems some were not able to get out. I pity the children. We saw dead bodies on the side, and some being rescued,"" he said. MV Saint Thomas of Aquinas: The death toll from a collision between a cargo ship and a passenger ferry off the waters of the central Philippines rose to 17 . Tragedy: A cargo vessel docked at a sea has collided with a passenger ferry in Talisay, Cebu, central Philippines killing at least 17 people . Tears: Rescued Filipino survivors arrive at a port in Cebu city, central Philippines . He said the ferry was entering the pier when the cargo vessel, which was on the way out, suddenly collided with it. ""One of the persons who jumped with us hit his head on metal. He is shaking and he is bloodied,"" Mr Agudong said. The 455ft -long ferry sank in about 30 minutes, he said. The youngest among those rescued was an 11-month baby, news reports said. The ferry came from Nasipit in Agusan del Sur province in the southern Philippines on a day-long journey, Mr Agudong said. Accidents at sea are common in the Philippine archipelago because of frequent storms, badly maintained boats and weak enforcement of safety regulations. In 1987, the ferry Dona Paz sank after colliding with a fuel tanker in the Philippines, killing more than 4,341 people in the world's worst peacetime maritime disaster. In 2008, the ferry MV Princess of the Stars capsized during a typhoon in the central Philippines, killing nearly 800 people. The ferry came from the Agusan del Sur province in the southern Philippines on a daylong journey and was travelling towards Manila in the North.

"Manchester United's Daley Blind put on a brave face to thank supporters for their well wishes after he suffered a knee injury while on international duty. The Dutchman, who has featured eight times in the Premier League for United since his move from Ajax in the summer, was taken off in the first half of Holland's 6-0 win over Latvia. He took to Twitter on Thursday to thank fans for their messages of support as he works his way back to full fitness.

Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal played down fears that Blind could be out for up to six months. 'It's not as bad as the doctors thought after the match,' the United boss said.

"Glen Johnson looks destined to leave Anfield next summer after he revealed there is no prospect of his future being resolved. Johnson, like Steven Gerrard, can start talking to foreign clubs in 31 days about joining them on a Bosman at the end of the season. But whereas Liverpool are in talks with their captain about a new deal, Johnson’s situation is drifting. The full back is clearly still committed to the cause — ending up with stitches in his head after diving in to score the winning goal — but has accepted that the end may be near. Liverpool's Glen Johnson strikes late with a header to give his side a vital 1-0 victory over Stoke City at Anfield . Liverpool have not made any contact with him about extending his terms and Johnson, who has attracted interest from Roma, insists that he will not be pleading for a new deal. ‘I want to play for a club that wants me,’ said Johnson, who moved to Merseyside from Portsmouth for £17.5million in 2009. ‘I’ve seen some stuff that I have been offered half the money I am on. That’s not true. I haven’t been offered anything. ‘Time goes very quick. I’ve enjoyed my time here, the majority of the six years. There have been some good times, some bad times. But if I haven’t got a contract, I can’t stay. It does play on your mind but you have to be professional and do your best. I respect my team-mates more than anyone. Johnson celebrates scoring the vitally important winner with a thumbs up to the Anfield crowd late on . ‘I’m not going to go crawling to anybody. They know where I am and they know the situation. There were minor talks at the end of last season but nothing that I could accept or reject. ‘I don’t worry about things that I can’t control. All I can keep doing is my job. Whatever will unfold will unfold. It’s not my business to talk to other clubs. I’m concentrating on winning for Liverpool. I want to respect my contract and that’s what I will do.’ This has not been an easy season for Johnson. With Brendan Rodgers constantly chopping and changing his defence, his form has dipped and he has lost his place in the England squad. Johnson is congratulated by his Liverpool team-mates but needed treatment after taking a hit while scoring . That has led to him becoming a target for supporters’ frustrations. There were a number of growls on Saturday when he made a mistake in the third minute. Aside from that Johnson did little wrong and followed up bravely after Rickie Lambert’s effort struck the woodwork. ‘It hurts a lot less when the ball hits the net,’ said Johnson. ‘When Rickie headed it, I thought it was going to hit the bar, so I just kept going. We fought hard and I would have been very upset if we’d only drawn. We deserved to win.’ Rodgers sprinted down the touchline and celebrated the goal with supporters. Behind him, his assistants and Liverpool’s substitutes vaulted from their seats. Rodgers reflected: ‘There was a feeling of elation, probably a mixture of relief.

The scrutiny was on us in a big game against a tough side but we came through it very well.’ Stoke will consider themselves unlucky. On another day Bojan Krkic would have scored rather than hitting the post. ‘There wasn’t any real momentum behind Liverpool’s play and we dealt with that quite easily,’ said Stoke manager Mark Hughes. ‘We let ourselves down. We had three or four defenders and (Johnson) reacted quicker than we did when it bounced off the bar.’ Liverpool manager Rodgers looks cheerful after his side secured a late win at Anfield against Stoke .","Full back scored late winner as Liverpool beat Stoke 1-0 on Saturday .

"Asia Bibi in an undated family handout photo: The Pakistani Christian has filed her last possible appeal against the death sentence for insulting Mohammed . A Christian woman on death row in Pakistan for blasphemy has filed a last-ditch legal challenge to her conviction for insulting the Prophet Mohammed four years ago. A high court in the eastern city of Lahore confirmed the death sentence of Asia Bibi last month, dashing hopes the conviction might be overturned or commuted to a jail term. It comes after she made an impassioned plea to supporters in an open letter. 'You are my only hope of staying alive in this dungeon, so please don’t abandon me,' she said. 'I did not commit blasphemy.' Bibi, a 50-year-old mother-of-five, has been on death row since November 2010 after she was convicted of insulting Mohammed during a row with Muslim co-workers over a bowl of water. Blasphemy is a hugely sensitive issue in majority Muslim Pakistan country, with even unproven allegations often prompting mob violence. Bibi's defence attorney Saiful Malook told AFP yesterday he had filed an appeal on her behalf to the Supreme Court. He said that in the petition his client has asked the court to reconsider deficiencies in the case including allegedly manipulated evidence and a delay between the time of the incident and its investigation by police. Mr Malook added that the blasphemy allegation was concocted by Bibi's enemies to target her and had no basis in fact. 'We expect an early hearing of the appeal and hope that the proceedings will be over in one year,' he added. The legal challenge is in addition to a personal plea from Bibi's husband Ashiq Masih to Pakistan's President Mamnoon Hussain asking for her to be pardoned and allowed to move to France. 'We are convinced that Asia will only be saved from being hanged if the venerable President (Mamnoon) Hussain grants her a pardon. No one should be killed for drinking a glass of water,' he wrote in the New York Times. Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo has said the couple are welcomed in the city, and Masih quoted his wife as saying she sent her 'deepest thanks to you Madame Mayor, and to all the kind people of Paris and across the world'. Bibi's message from jail read: 'My prison cell has no windows and day and night are the same to me, but if I am still holding on today it is thanks to everyone who is trying to help me. When my husbnd showed me the photographs of people I have never met drinking a glass of water for me, my heart overflowed. 'Ashiq told me that the city of Paris is offering to welcome our family. I send my deepest thanks to you Madam Mayor, and to all the kind people of Paris and across the world. 'You are my only hope of staying alive in this dungeon, so please don’t abandon me. I did not commit blasphemy.' Ashiq Masih, Bibi's husband: The legal challenge is in addition to a personal plea from Mr Masih to Pakistan's President Mamnoon Hussain asking for his wife to be pardoned and allowed to move to France . Bibi's daughters pictured in a 2010 file photo: The allegations against Bibi date back to June 2009, when she was labouring in a field and a row broke out with some Muslim women she was working with . Mr Masih, 50, lives in hiding with two of his five children and has to keep his identity secret as he scrapes together a living as a daily labourer. He visits his wife once a month, making a five and a half hour journey to her jail in Multan in southern Punjab. The allegations against Bibi date back to June 2009, when she was labouring in a field and a row broke out with some Muslim women she was working with. She was asked to fetch water, but the Muslim women objected, saying that as a non-Muslim she was unfit to touch the water bowl. A few days later the women went to a local cleric and put forward the blasphemy allegations. Amnesty International has raised 'serious concerns' about the fairness of her trial and has called for her release. Pakistan has never executed anyone for blasphemy and has had a de-facto moratorium on civilian executions since 2008. But anyone convicted, or even just accused, of insulting Islam, risks a violent and bloody death at the hands of vigilantes.","Asia Bibi has spent four years on death row for insulting Mohammed .

"Tom Elliott is not a name many of us have heard before. He played for England Under 18s and is the youngest player ever to represent Leeds. That apart, the 24-year-old centre forward has lived his professional life pretty much in the shadows. Shortly after five past eight, however, the Cambridge United forward found himself thrust centre stage in this replay rather sooner than he would have aniticipated. It is a moment that will stay with him for a rather long time. Manchester United breezed past Cambridge United in their FA Cup fourth round replay at Old Trafford on Tuesday night . Juan Mata and Marcos Rojo both scored in the first half as Manchester United sealed their place in the fifth round of the FA Cup .

Elliott and his Cambridge United team-mates react in despair after seeing his shot flick the outside of the post and go wide . Man Utd: De Gea 6, McNair 7, Smalling 6, Evans 6, Rojo 6.5 (Young 81), Blind 6, Rooney 7, Di Maria 7 (Herrera 71, 6.5), Mata 7, Van Persie 6.5 (Wilson 66, 7), Fellaini 7.5.

Subs Not Used: Norris, Ball, Gaffney, Bobby Joe Taylor. Ref: Jonathan Moss (W Yorkshire). Ratings by LUKE AUGUSTUS . Less than a minute had gone — kick off having been delayed by traffic issues — when Manchester United’s Daley Blind rather inexplicably played a pass directly into Elliott’s path to set him clean through on goal. The pass could not have been more perfect for a centre forward had Blind played it there on purpose. It sent Elliott clear with time to spare. It gave him time to think and perhaps this was the problem. Had the Cambridge player needed to rely on instinct, maybe he would now be telling his friends about the night he stunned Old Trafford with a goal in front of the Stretford End. Instead, Elliott eased forward rather unconvincingly towards United goalkeeper David de Gea and could only place his shot against the left upright. It was a decent effort, certainly nothing to be ashamed of. But in that moment a career defining opportunity had come and gone. Such are the margins between notoriety and humdrum anonymity in the FA Cup. ‘He did everything right,’ said Elliott’s manager Richard Money afterwards. Clearly that was incorrect. Had he done so, he would have scored. Even if that had happened, Cambridge would not have won this game. Money candidly acknowledged as much in his post-match interviews. United were too strong, too organised and purposeful. The team from League Two would have led at the most famous football stadium in Britain, though, and that would have been a story all on its own. Kick-off in the FA Cup fourth round replay at Old Trafford was delayed by 20 minutes due to traffic problems .

Click here for more stats, facts, heat maps and formations from Old Trafford. As it was, that fleeting passage of play transpired to be Cambridge’s best of the night. They spent the majority of the next 89 minutes in their own half and although United were not always fluent, the home team were efficient enough. They were two-nil up and seemingly already in the next round by half time. As is often the case this season, United’s early football was not that exciting. Set up this time by a coach still searching for the right system in some kind of 4-1-4-1 formation, United were rather dysfunctional for 20 minutes or so. Not until Wayne Rooney — playing deeper than Marouane Fellaini — drove a shot at goalkeeper Chris Dunn in the 18th minute did they have an effort on target. Argentine defender Rojo doubled Manchester United's lead over Cambridge United in the 32nd minute at Old Trafford . Rojo headed in a cross beyond the reach of Cambridge defender Chris Dunn on the line to put Manchester United 2-0 ahead . Rojo looks to the heavens as he celebrates scoring Manchester United's second goal against Cambridge United . After opening the scoring, Juan Mata has now been involved in 15 goals in his last 15 FA Cup matches - scoring six and assisting nine. Indeed, a minute or so before they took the lead, United’s body language began to look a little suspect. When Juan Mata did eventually nudge them ahead in the 24th minute, it was a goal that had arrived at just the right time. A nice pass infield from the impressive Patrick McNair — playing at right back — began the move and eventually Angel di Maria was provided with possession in space down the left. The Argentinean had endured a patchy evening but the cross he lofted to the far post was perfect for Fellaini. When the big midfielder nodded the ball down, Mata was alert enough to poke it high in to the net from about four yards. After almost 115 minutes of play against a team from the bottom rung, a goal was greeted with some relief by United. Within ten minutes they had another. Wilson came off the bench to score Manchester United's third goal in the 73rd minute to finish off Cambridge United . Wilson fired home from the edge of the area as his low shot found the bottom corner with 17 minutes to play in the replay . Wilson jumps in the air to celebrate after scoring the third goal for Manchester United in their fourth round replay . This time Fellaini peeled away to collect an overhit corner and when his shot was blocked Robin van Persie chipped the ball towards Marcos Rojo. He headed home to give United breathing space. Cambridge by now looked beaten but by no means bowed. As was perhaps to be expected, though, United’s football became more expansive as the game wore on. Rooney brought a save from Dunn with a crashing volley in the second half while Van Persie was denied by the goalkeeper at the foot of the post. For Cambridge it was beginning to shape up into a long night. Manchester United striker Robin van Persie unleashes a header at goal during the first half of the FA Cup fourth round replay . Cambridge United's Luke Chadwick, who used to play for Manchester United, beats Chris Smalling in the air . Cambridge United's Elliott goes to the ground to tackle Manchester United's Belgian midfielder Fellaini . Cambridge United midfielder Ryan Donaldson tries to skip away from Manchester United's Argentine defender Rojo . Manchester United's Argentine winger Angel di Maria tries to break down the Cambridge United defence . Sir Alex Ferguson used to claim he instructed his United teams not to ‘humiliate’ lower-league opposition at home but there was not much chance of Louis van Gaal delivering similar instructions. It has, after all, been a while since this United team took anybody apart. Other chances came and went as the game meandered on and Dunn saved spectacularly from Di Maria. With 17 minutes left, however, he could do nothing as United substitute James Wilson fired an accurate, low shot from 20 yards. Elliott did eventually manage an effort on target for his team — De Gea fielding a header as the game approached its conclusion. The Cambridge striker’s night, though, ended with a neat pass through to McGeehan in injury time, his team-mate shooting wide. Elliott’s best contribution of the whole match was rather more accurate than his first.","Manchester United move into the fifth round of the FA Cup with win over Cambridge United .

"As one of the most expensive properties in Scotland, this sprawling 112-room castle might not look like a typical bargain buy. But this 300-estate is set to go for a knock-down price after its owner put it on the market for £5million - £1.5million less than it cost to buy and renovate. Kate Armstrong, the founder of price comparison website Confused.com, bought Cassillis House near Maybole, Ayrshire, in 2009 for £3million, before spending millions of pounds - and the next four years - on giving the neglected property a 21st-century makeover. Bargain: The sprawling Cassillis House, pictured, is set on a 300-acre estate near Maybole in Ayrshire. The new buyer will own four other properties on the land . Carefully restored: The kitchen features wood cabinets which are complimented by modern lighting fixtures. Mrs Armstrong spent four years renovating the property . Authentic: An intricate doorway hints at the castle's history, left, while a carefully restored spiral staircase adds a touch of medieval grandeur to the property, right . Spacious: The castle boasts 13 bedrooms, seven of which are luxurious en-suites. This bathroom features a free-standing roll-top bath and elegant shower . The mammoth four-year project was last year featured in the BBC2 programme Restoration Home, which is presented by Caroline Quentin. But the Australian tycoon and her family have not been able to spend as much time at the medieval castle as they had hoped. They have now put the historic property up for sale for a knock-down five million pounds. Mrs Armstrong has previously stated that the project had been a labour of love and the sale price is designed to attract a quick buyer who will take care of the building in the future. Cassillis House boasts 13 bedrooms, seven of which have luxurious en-suites, a ballroom, library, wine cellar, cinema room, and space for a gym. And for the £5million asking price, the buyer will also own four other properties on the estate including a five-bed coach house. The castle, which was built between 1404 and 1454, had been neglected for many years before Mrs Armstrong bought it, and had problems including rot to the roofs and damage to ornate design work. Bright and airy: Mrs Armstrong was careful to make sure the castle retained its traditional feel by choosing subdued colours for the walls and restoring original features . Grand: Vast windows flood the rooms with natural light, while imposing doorways add character to the 122-room home . Exquisite: The sprawling gardens can be seen stretching out into the distance from the windows of this room, where a fireplace is the centrepiece . The restoration project saw many historical features retained including a . 15th century staircase and a two-storey front dating between 1830 and . 1832. Mrs Armstrong worked with Historic Scotland on it and had the castle painted yellow, which would have been the original colour. Cassilis is being sold by estate agents Savills. Evelyn Channing, of . Savills, said: 'Someone has gone through the pain of a complete . restoration and it’s now ready for 21st century living. 'Normally there is some sort of project but this is ready to go, and it has such amazing history. Regal: Rich red curtains and carpets add warmth to this grand room, which features painted exposed beams on the ceiling . Calming: Soft blues and greens on wall panels compliment a sea scene painted above the doorway in this room that is flooded with natural light . Country retreat: History appears to come alive in this room, where an unusual stone and wood ceiling and deep red walls dominate the space . 'That . building has been standing there since the 13th century and you can . just imagine everything it has witnessed over the generations. 'Many . ancient interesting features have been retained such as the tower and a . bedroom that was discovered when they pulled away some of the plaster. 'Although it’s on the market for five million pounds this is still one of the most expensive properties in Scotland. If it went up for an unrealistic level it would get no interest. 'It . is on the market for less than what [Mrs Armstrong] has spent on it. She is not asking for all her money back. She is more concerned . about making sure the castle is being looked after.' Bathing in blue: Mrs Armstrong made the most of the space in this room by building in a window seat. She said she wanted to make sure the property was going to a good owner . Modern comforts: The 13-bedroom castle boasts a cinema room, complete with a tartan carpet, a ballroom, wine cellar - and has space for a gym . Bonus: In addition to the main house, the new buyer will own the four other properties on the estate, including a five-bedroom coach house and a stables cottage . Cassillis was built between 1404 and 1454 and was owned by the Kennedy family from the 15th century until 2009, after the last descendent, Mary, Marchioness of Ailsa, died. And the estate comes with its own colourful - and slightly morbid - history. David Kennedy, the 1st Earl of Cassillis, was killed at the Battle of Flodden, while the second Earl was murdered following an unsuccessful attempt to rescue James V. The third Earl was poisoned in France while attending the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots.","Kate Armstrong, founder of price comparison website Confused.com, bought Cassillis House in Ayrshire in 2009 .

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (left) and New York Police Department Commissioner Bill Bratton arrive at the press conference after taking the subway. New York Police Commissioner Bratton said the NYPD has put increased resources toward protecting subways and rail stations and there will be more police patrols . They were responding to claims by the Iraqi Prime Minister this morning that ISIS militants are planning to carry out terror attacks on the New York and Paris subways. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi today claimed to have received 'credible' information from intelligence officials in Baghdad that foreign fighters belonging to ISIS were plotting attacks. National Security Council spokesman Caitlin Hayden said:  'We have not confirmed such a plot, and would have to review any information from our Iraqi partners before making further determinations We take any threat seriously and always work to corroborate information we receive from our partners.' Mr Abadi made his remarks at a meeting with journalists on the sidelines of a gathering of world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly in New York today. He said that the suspects included Islamic extremists originally from the United States and France who have been fighting alongside ISIS terrorists in Iraq. Threat: Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said he was told of the plot by intelligence officials in Baghdad, and that it was the work of extremists originally from the U.S. and France who have been fighting for ISIS . Radicals: ISIS supporters slogans as they carry the group's flags in front of the provincial government headquarters in Mosul, Iraq. Militants in the country are suspected of plotting the New York and Paris attacks . 'Today, while I am here, I am receiving accurate reports . from Baghdad where there was [the] arrest of [a] few elements . and there are networks planning from inside Iraq to have . attacks,' he said. 'They plan to have attacks in the metros of Paris and the . U.S.,' he added, speaking in English. 'From the details I have received, yes it looks . credible.' 'They are not Iraqis. Some of them are French, some of them are Americans. But they are in Iraq,' Mr Abadi went on to say. His claims were quickly slapped down by U.S. officials, however. 'We've seen the reports of Prime Minister Abadi's comments. We have not confirmed such a plot, and would have to review any information from our Iraqi partners before making further determinations,' said Caitlin Hayden, spokesperson for the U.S. National Security Council. 'We take any threat seriously and always work to corroborate information we receive from our partners. We're obviously very focused on the issue of foreign fighters, as you saw evidenced yesterday at the Security Council session the President chaired, she added. Force: A handout picture made available by the US Department of Defense today shows a formation of US Navy F-18E Super Hornets refueling having carried out airstrikes on targets linked to ISIS . Allies: Last Friday French President Francois Hollande (left) ordered his country's air force to carry out attacks on ISIS targets in Iraq. In doing so, France joined a 'broad coalition' of nations agreeing to support plans by U.S. president Barack Obama (right) to 'degrade and eventually destroy' the terrorist group . Strikes: A U.S.-led coalition opened airstrikes inside Syria on Monday, expanding weeks of attacks by the United States on Islamic State targets in Iraq . The Iraqi Prime Minister said that he received the information from intelligence officials based in Baghdad earlier this morning. In addition to the brutality Islamic State has visited on the people of Iraq and Syria, western leaders have voiced concern that the group would turn its terror operations outside the region. A U.S.-led coalition opened airstrikes inside Syria on Monday, expanding weeks of attacks by the United States on Islamic State targets in Iraq. A fresh wave of airstrikes from the United States and its Arab allies hit ISIS oil refineries overnight, killing at least 14 militants and striking at the heart of the terror group's funding. ISIS generates up to $2million a day from the sale of oil, employing highly trained engineers to extract thousands of barrels a day from the vast swaths of Syria and Iraq under the terror group's control. Thousands of Algerian soldiers supported by helicopters are hunting for the ISIS-linked Islamist terrorists who beheaded a French mountaineer in a sickening video released yesterday. Herve Gourdel, 55, was captured by the Islamist group Jund al-Khilifa while hiking in the Djurdjura National Park on Sunday - just one day after he arrived in Algeria for a 10-day walking holiday. Mr Gourdel was brutally murdered yesterday, less than 24 hours after militants uploaded a video to YouTube warning that the married father-of-two would be killed unless France pulled out of a coalition of nations bombing targets connected to the ISIS in Iraq. Murdered: Herve Gourdel, 55, (pictured right, holding a water bottle) was captured by the Islamist group Jund al-Khilifa while hiking in the Djurdjura National Park on Sunday - just one day after arriving for a walking holiday . Execution: ISIS-linked militants in Algeria beheaded  Herve Gourdel yesterday after he was captured at the weekend. The group earlier made threats to kill Mr Gourdel if France did not stop bombing targets in Iraq . By early this morning some 2000 soldiers were involved in the search in the Tizi Ouzou region, along with 500 marines supported by sniffers dogs. 'Everything will be done to bring the killers to justice,' said a spokesman for Algeria's Defence Ministry. The news came as France's defense minister Jean-Yves Le Drian revealed his country is considering whether to expand airstrikes into Syria to assist a U.S. and Arab coalition in thwarting ISIS' advances. There are 30,000 French citizens living in Algeria, where Mr Gourdel was brutally murdered yesterday by militants loyal to ISIS - the terror group led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi which controls a swath of territory larger than Britain and a population of four million brutally oppressed citizens. Asked about the  French citizens living in Algeria, Mr Le Drian told RTL radio that the goal of the extremist groups is to 'spread terror. Experienced: Mr Gourdel was a professional mountaineering guide and amateur photographer. Although he enjoyed spending time in remote locations around the world, he was always extremely careful, friends said . Grieving: This morning tributes were paid to murdered professional mountaineering guide Herve Gourdel by locals in his home city of Nice, where a book of condolence was opened in his memory . The Algerian government last night reiterated its commitment to protecting foreign residents living inside the country. There are fears that other radical Islamist groups may carry out copycat attacks on Westerners following calls to do so by ISIS on Sunday. The kidnapping and murder of Gourdel, however, is believed to be a crime of opportunity, since Algeria's extremist have been confined to remote mountainous regions and the French mountaineer was one of only a very few foreigners to venture into this area. This morning tributes were paid to the professional mountaineering guide, both from politicians and from locals in his home city of Nice, where a book of condolence was opened in his memory. Mr Gourdel - a passionate amateur photographer - was a married father of two adult children.","Mayor de Blasio: 'I have a simple message: There is no threat to our subway'

"Billionaire investor George Soros has warned the global economic system could collapse and riots on the streets of America are on the way. The 81-year-old said he’d rather survive than stay rich as the world faces an ‘evil’ period and Europe fights a ‘descent into chaos and conflict’. He has backed the euro, bought $2billion in European bonds and insisted the economic climate is similar to the 1930s Great Depression. Warnings: George Soros said he'd rather survive than stay rich as the world faces an 'evil' period and Europe fights a 'descent into chaos and conflict' ‘The euro must survive because the alternative - a breakup - would cause a meltdown that Europe, the world, can’t afford,’ he told Newsweek. ‘The situation is about as serious and difficult as I’ve experienced in my career. We are facing now a general retrenchment in the developed world.’ His warnings came as U.S. stocks dipped on Tuesday, with talks to resolve Greece's debt crisis faltering and threatening a five-day winning streak. Greece moved closer to the possibility of a chaotic default after euro zone officials rejected a final offer from the country's private bondholders. Mr Soros, known as the ‘the man who broke the Bank of England’ after he made $1billion when Britain's pound crashed in 1992, had more warnings. ‘The best-case scenario is a deflationary environment,’ he told Newsweek. ‘The worst-case scenario is a collapse of the financial system.’ Support: Mr Soros has backed the Euro, bought $2billion in European bonds and insisted the economic climate is similar to the 1930s Great Depression . The veteran financer added that ‘it’s very hard to know how you can be right’ after all the problems associated with the ‘boom years’ before now. 'The euro must survive because the alternative - a breakup - would cause a meltdown' George Soros . Mr Soros compared the economic crisis to the collapse of the Soviet Union and said people do not fully understand what is happening. He told Newsweek a euro collapse could ‘revive the political conflicts that have torn Europe apart over the centuries’ and increase racism. The European bonds he bought were mostly Italian and from ex-Goldman Sachs chief Jon Corzine’s now-collapsed securities firm MF Global. Investments: Mr Soros bought European bonds from the now-collapsed securities firm MF Global, run by ex-Goldman Sachs chief Jon Corzine (pictured) Meanwhile on Tuesday, U.S. central bank . the Federal Reserve opened a two-day meeting that is expected to end . with a signal that interest rates will be held near zero into 2014. 'The situation is about as serious and difficult as I’ve experienced in my career' George Soros . Mr Soros, based in Manhattan, New York, . is known to make his money on long-term solid share choices and avoids . investing in gold. He supports the Occupy Wall Street movement and claims the response to potential unrest could be worse than the riots. ‘It will be an excuse for cracking down and using strong-arm tactics to maintain law and order,’ Mr Soros told Newsweek. He is also a Democratic supporter and believes President Barack Obama will ‘surprise’ the country by winning the 2012 general election. Backing: Mr Soros is a Democratic supporter and believes President Barack Obama (pictured) will 'surprise' the country by winning the 2012 general election . But he survived a ‘personally much more threatening situation’ than the current crisis when he escaped the Holocaust in Hungary in the 1940s. 'The worst-case scenario is a collapse of the financial system' George Soros . His personal life was also challenged last year when his long-time girlfriend Adriana Ferreyr sued him for allegedly causing her distress and assaulting her. However he slammed her lawsuit as ‘riddled with false charges and obviously an attempt to extract money’, reported Newsweek. Mr Soros added that the European Union could still ‘regain its lustre’ and the U.S. may go some way to ‘actually strengthening the institution’. Forecast: The International Monetary Fund - headed by Christine Lagarde, pictured, predicts global growth of 3.25 per cent in 2012 . In a separate report, world leaders were today urged to focus on growth more than budget cuts this year as fears deepened that recession in Europe will slow the global economy. Global-lending organisation the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts global growth of 3.25 per cent in 2012, slower than the 4 per cent it projected in September. In turn, the 17 nations that share the euro will shrink 0.5 per cent this year, compared to its forecast for 1.1 per cent growth four months ago. Europe's recession should only have a modest impact on the U.S., which the IMF believes will grow by 1.8 per cent growth over the same period, unchanged from its September estimate. But it warned against steep budget cuts, which it says will slow growth further and undermine market confidence, running against the push for budget cuts backed by Germany’s Angela Merkel. It comes as the single currency fell back from three-week highs and world stocks stumbled as the latest setback in efforts to restructure Greek debt triggered more fears about the region’s outlook.

"A British law student accused of targeting former prime minister Tony Blair is facing a retrial after the jury was discharged in the UK's first secret terror trial. Erol Incedal, 26, was charged with preparing an act of terrorism with others abroad, either against individuals or a 'Mumbai-style' attack, as well as possessing a bomb-making document on a memory card. He denied the offences. After three-and-a-half weeks of evidence and five days' deliberations, the seven women and five men of the Old Bailey jury were discharged this morning by Mr Justice Nicol. Erol Incedal was charged with preparing a terrorist act. He denied the charges. He now faces a  retrial . The judge ordered a retrial, for which a date has not been set. It is believed it will take place in the New Year. The jury, which retired at 11.13am last Wednesday, had been deliberating for 23 hours and 35 minutes. During the trial, the court heard that Incedal was stopped and arrested by police on September 30 last year for driving his black Mercedes car at 60mph in a 40mph zone with no licence and insurance. Officers discovered a slip of paper with the address of former prime minister Mr Blair and his wife Cherie on it in the car and planted a bug which picked up Incedal's conversations in the following days. The Turkish-born defendant was heard on tape to complain about 'pigs' to his wife and talking about going to a 'Plan B'. He said: 'I made a big mistake. Some very important stuff was in the car. If they find it, I would be f*****.' On October 13 last year, armed police stopped Incedal's car again near London Bridge and arrested him on suspicion of being a terrorist. They searched the Turkish-born father-of-two's home address in  south London, where they found notes on a 'Plan A'. It detailed a checklist of 'three to four workers, two tennis racquets, one month's surveillance, rent nearby flat, transport, assess security, assess risk, legitimacy, action etc', the court heard. And at a second shared flat near Paddington, officers uncovered a laptop computer containing coded messages about a Mumbai-style attack and a Kalashnikov rifle, the court has heard. A judge, sitting at the Old Bailey (pictured), ordered a retrial, which it is believed will take place in the New Year . They also discovered a photograph of an East End synagogue on his iPhone as well as an internet search history including YouTube pages on Isis. In his defence, Incedal denied that he had been planning a terrorist attack. He accepted that he possessed the memory card but said he had a reasonable excuse for it. The majority of the Old Bailey trial has been heard behind closed doors, at times with accredited journalists present but unable to report on proceedings, but mainly completely in secret. In all, 40 hours of evidence was heard behind closed doors, eight hours with accredited reporters present and 12 hours in open court. Incedal was formerly known in the court case as AB and his co-defendant Mounir Rarmoul-Bouhadjar, 26, who has admitted possessing an identical bomb-making document, as CD. The exceptional and controversial arrangements for the secret trial were made after a media challenge at the High Court against the entire case being heard in secret on grounds of national security. As well as opening up the case to partial reporting, it led to the defendants being named in public for the first time.

"Wayne Rooney’s one concession to the celebration of his 100th cap will be to lead out the England team with his sons Kai and Klay. All being well, it will happen at Wembley next month against Slovenia. He will be the ninth English footballer to reach his century and, at 29, the youngest by nearly three years. There will still be time to train his sights on Peter Shilton’s record of 125, though Roy Hodgson plans to set more immediate targets for his captain. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Wayne Rooney practicing free-kicks during England training . England captain Wayne Rooney wants to lead out the team for his 100th cap with his sons Kai and Klay . Rooney is set to become the youngest England player to hit the 100-cap mark by nearly three years . This graphic from Tuesday's Daily Mail shows how Rooney will be the youngest to become a centurion . ‘His goal should be quite a simple one,’ said Hodgson. ‘He should concentrate on France 2016 — a) make sure we get there, b) make certain if we are making any improvements that they continue, and c) take that responsibility. ‘Hopefully, if it all works out and we do qualify and are playing a bit better when we get there, I think it will be quite easy for him to take the next step. I wouldn’t worry too much about the next 25 caps. Get the next 10 in.’ The England manager speaks with genuine affection for Rooney, the man he chose to succeed Steven Gerrard, and staunchly backed him when he came under fire for his performances. Rooney can polarise opinion. In Estonia, his free-kick won the game. He was always the player most likely to score and yet he was criticised for missing chances, just as he had done against San Marino last Thursday. Rooney looked the player most likely to score and was England's saviour against Estonia with a free kick . England manager Roy Hodgson says he would prefer Rooney concentrates on Euro 2016 rather than records . It is hard to argue with the facts. He has 43 goals in 99 games for his country. Sir Bobby Charlton’s 49-goal record is also in view. ‘As I’m edging closer, I think about it,’ said Rooney. ‘But I’m a strong believer that if it’s going to happen, it will. When that time comes I’ll be delighted. At the minute it’s a matter of wanting to score for the three points.’ Rooney has watched David Beckham, Gerrard, Ashley Cole and Frank Lampard reach 100 caps during his England career, which started in a friendly against Australia in 2003. ‘It is a great honour,’ he said ‘I’ll be looking forward to it and excited about the next game. There’s no special plans but my two boys will walk on to the pitch with me. That’ll be it. ‘It is a fantastic achievement to play for your country for so long. I remember David Beckham, Steven Gerrard, Frank and Ashley getting their hundred caps and how much it meant to them. Rooney could close in on Peter Shilton's record of 125 (left) and David Beckham's 115 (right) Sir Bobby Charlton's (standing in front of Rooney and wife Coleen at Old Trafford) 49-goal record is also in view . Born: Liverpool, October 24 1985 (28) Playing position: Forward . 2002-2004: Everton (67 lg apps, 15 gls) 2004-NOW: Manchester United (313, 161) 2003-NOW: England (99, 43) ‘You don’t think you’ll achieve this when you first get into the team, but over the last two or three years, when I got into the 70s, 80s and 90s, then you know it is going to happen. I’ll be the youngest but I started younger than most.’ Rooney made his Everton debut at 16, against Tottenham in August 2002. Twelve years and more than 600 senior games later, he is warming to his leadership roles as captain of Manchester United and England. For his country, he has inherited the penalty-taking responsibilities as well as the armband from Gerrard and produced a free-kick in Tallinn to rekindle memories of the days when Captain Becks stepped up to rescue the team with his dead-ball excellence. Hodgson said: ‘When I came into the job two years ago, I didn’t quite know what to expect from him. My knowledge of him was shaped by TV, radio and newspapers. I was surprised. He is a very different person than I thought he would be; very driven and professional. Rooney made his debut at Everton at the age of 16 but is to be 29 and knocking on the door of English records . England captain and forward Rooney celebrates his goal against Estonia during the Euro 2016 qualifying win . ‘Since he has had the captaincy, he has taken on even more responsibility and to get 100 caps for your country is some achievement because of the competition you face for your shirt. ‘He has taken a bashing over the years and that has toughened him up. Some players get to 34-35 and don’t play anywhere near as much football as he has played.’ The England boss also praised him for taking over smoothly from Gerrard. ‘Both engage very well in particular with the younger players and give them the benefit of their knowledge and experience,’ said Hodgson. ‘Both are unbelievably passionate about England. You knew every time they went out on the field they would sweat everything for England. That doesn’t always mean they had great games but you don’t have to look at them and say, “He’s not at it today” or, “He’s not taking it seriously”.

"He survived the Blitz, five monarchs and both World Wars. But Thomas, who was Britain's oldest resident, has died aged 130 - after being bitten by a rat. He was born in 1882 and was pulled out of the rubble of a bomb-hit house in Essex in 1945. The reptile had to be put down by owner June Le Gallez after being attacked by a rat in the back garden of her home in Guernsey. Thomas, who survived the Blitz, has died aged 130 after being bitten by a rat . Tearful June said: 'We are all very upset as you can imagine, Thomas was like a member of the family. 'He was put down after he was bitten on the leg by a rogue rat in the garden and the wound become so inflamed that it started pushing into his shell. 'Thomas was given antibiotics by vets after flies laid eggs in his wound and it appeared to be infected. 'But he wasn't eating or appearing to get any better, despite my attempts to feed him through a tube and bath him two times a day, so a week later as a family we made the decision to put him to sleep.' Owner June Le Gallez, 54, from Guernsey, tried to do everything to keep Thomas alive . Thomas, pictured with James Le Gallez about 20 years ago, survived five monarch - but was defeated by a rat . Natural shell-ection: Thomas was born in 1882, the year scientist Charles Darwin died . Thomas was kept company by fellow tortoises Gorky and Carstaias, who are both 50-years old. June said: 'Gorky got bitten on the nose too but Thomas suffered the brunt of the attack. 'For over 30 years the tortoises have roamed free in the garden and nothing has happened. 'It's such a shame for him to go this way. Thomas has been through so much.' June inherited Thomas, born when William Gladstone was Prime Minister, in 1978 from her cousin Grace Hilditch. Grace had been given Thomas in 1922 as a present from her father Harry, who was friends with a reptile keeper at London Zoo. Thomas . was born in the same year as author Virginia Woolf and the year that . Charles Darwin died. He survived both World Wars and the Falkland War. He survived five monarchs; Queen Victoria, King Edward VII, King George V, King Edward VIII and George VI. Thomas was also alive during some the 20th century's most iconic moments, such as the sinking of the Titanic in 1912, the First and Second World Wars, England's World Cup win in 1966, the Apollo moon landing in 1969 and the London 2012 Olympics. He may have remembered this: Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee photographic portrait taken in 1897 . 'It was s-hell': Thomas on the Titanic disaster.

"Rurik Jutting was regarded as a ‘Santa Claus’ figure by a former girlfriend and her family in the Philippines, they revealed yesterday. The banker ‘had a hearty laugh’ and showered 22-year-old Ariane Guarin and her relatives with generosity during his visits. He and Miss Guarin had an intense six-month relationship which ended in acrimonious circumstances about a month before he is said to have murdered two call girls in Hong Kong. Generous: Banker Rurik Jutting with former girlfriend Ariane Guarin and members of her family in the Philippines . But before they split, the clearly overweight Cambridge graduate posed for pictures with her and her family in the Philippines. The pair met while he was visiting Angeles City, a notorious sex tourist destination just north of Manila, and there are claims that Miss Guarin was a ‘working girl’ both in the Philippines and in Hong Kong. Yesterday Miss Guarin’s family spoke of his kindness and their shock at Jutting, 29, being charged with murder in Hong Kong. Her brother Erwin said: ‘He liked to drink and he loved to swim. He had a hearty laugh, he reminded me of Santa Claus.’ Her sister Ellen added: ‘We don’t think he is the type who could do these crimes. He was very kind.’ She said the highly-paid investment banker would fly over just for a weekend and take them all with him if he wanted to eat out or go somewhere – even joining them on a beach holiday. She added: ‘He liked hanging out here. We would go to a nearby resort and go swimming. He would invite everyone, not just our family but our friends as well.’ Rurik Jutting and Miss Guarin (pictured together) had an intense six-month relationship which ended in acrimonious circumstances about a month before he is said to have murdered two call girls in Hong Kong . Miss Guarin’s mother Nimfa said: ‘He actually wanted her to go to Hong Kong but she had yet to apply for a passport. It was a good thing she didn’t go. If Rurik was capable of those crimes, he might have hurt my daughter. But he was kind and nice to us. It’s really confusing.’ The family said the couple split up after ‘things got complicated’ over the summer. Many of the pictures Jutting posted on his Facebook page featured Miss Guarin – known to friends as Yanie and who Jutting called his ‘beautiful honey’. Friends described her as a ‘lovely girl’. Such was their lavish lifestyle together, the couple were known as ‘Ruyanie’ – in the same way that Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are known by the combined name ‘Brangelina’. Yesterday it was revealed that police in the Philippines are investigating the disappearance of another young woman in Angeles City – the ‘sin city’ where Jutting was a frequent visitor. The woman, in her mid-20s, vanished in the red-light district last year and her mother reported her missing. Miss Guarin’s family spoke of his kindness and their shock at Jutting, 29, being charged with murder in Hong Kong . Jutting is understood to have visited the area several times over the last 18 months. Earlier this week, a friend of one Jutting’s alleged victims, Robert van den Bosch, said ‘well informed sources’ had told him that the murder suspect had regularly been to Angeles City. In one picture posted online, Jutting is seen with women in a strip bar called Rio Club – where tourists are known to pick up call girls. Police are expected to look at the travel movements of Jutting throughout his 18 months working in the Far East. Manila, Bangkok and the former Portuguese colony of Macau are other popular vice destinations. Jutting, a high-paid investment banker with Merrill Lynch, left London for Hong Kong last year. He is accused of killing Seneng Mujiasih, 32, and 25-year-old Sumarti Ningsih, who was found ‘nearly beheaded’ in a suitcase on the balcony of his flat. Merrill Lynch has declined to say if Jutting – whose out-of-office email referred to himself as ‘an insane psychopath’ – quit or was sacked. Yesterday it emerged he had enlisted a UK-based headhunting firm to find him a new banking job in Hong Kong. Jutting is due back in court on Monday.","Rurik Jutting regarded as 'Santa Claus' figure by former girlfriend and her family in Philippines .

"Sir Alex Ferguson has sympathised with West Ham manager Sam Allardyce, and says he 'never played against any West Ham team that played football I was afraid of.' The legendary United manager, writing in updated chapters of his autobiography, said he didn't understand Hammers supporters' insistence on the 'West Ham way'. The 72-year-old claims the 'way' is a myth that he never saw in his 26 years as Manchester United manager, and backed Allardyce's style as good management. Sir Alex Ferguson says West Ham fans expect too much of Sam Allardyce, who did well to keep them up .

And Ferguson also insisted that all the West Ham sides he'd faced as United boss had been either negative in their approach or lucky. 'I hope that before I die someone can explain the ""West Ham way"", writes Ferguson in his updated book. 'What is it? They last won a trophy in 1980, the FA Cup. 'I never played against any West Ham team that played football I was afraid of. They were always surviving, or lucky as hell against us.' Ferguson also labelled last season's West Ham squad as 'a team of very average players' who were helped by Allardyce. The Hammers, who currently sit fourth in the Premier League table after an excellent start to the season, finished with 40 points last year, seven clear of the relegation zone. And fans were extremely critical of Allardyce's style of football throughout last season, something which Ferguson thinks was uncalled for. 'There is this preconception with West Ham fans that Big Sam is a survivalist who tells teams to boot the ball up the pitch. 'The truth is that he stayed up with a team of very average players. That’s management. He drew the best from them.' Ferguson played against West Ham regularly over his 26 years at United, but said they were always negative .

"A three-day-old girl has become the latest victim of Typhoon Haiyan because the hospital she was in had no electricity. The parents of baby Althea Mustacia were forced to keep up a day and night routine of pumping air into her lungs by hand when she was born with newborn asphyxia. Despite their round-the-clock efforts, the little girl died three days later on the first floor of the Talcoban hospital chapel, which now serves as the neonatal unit. Scroll down for video . Latest victim: The mother of Althea Mustacisa is pictured pumping oxygen into the three-day-old's lungs in an attempt to keep her alive . Tragedy: Despite their efforts, three-day-old Althea died on the floor of a Catholic chapel inside the Eastern Visayas Regional Medical Center in Tacloban . Power cut: Althea, pictured with her parents standing over her, was born five days after the typhoon. She had asphyxia - where a baby doesn't breathe in the first minute following birth. Doctors believe she could have been saved if their incubators had been working . Newborn asphyxia is a condition where a baby does not start breathing in the minute following birth, and is the most common cause of infant mortality in the Philippines. The Tacloban medical centre has been badly damaged by the storm. It is partly flooded, walls have collapsed, part of the roof has fallen in, and there is no power. The little girl was born five days after the strongest storm ever to make landfall ripped through the city. Althea Mustacia has died after just three days of life after she stopped breathing and there was no electricity to power incubators in order to keep her alive (file picture) The neonatal unit in Tacloban hospital (pictured) has had to be moved into the chapel after the storm flooded parts of the centre, knocking down walls and causing part of the roof to cave in . Althea's parents spent three days pumping air into her lungs by hand, but their efforts were not enough to save her. Doctors have said that if the incubators were working she could have lived (file picture) Her 18-year-old mother shared shifts working a hand air pump with the girl's father in an effort to keep her alive. However she eventually died and doctors have said that if the hospital's incubators were working, she could have been saved. Althea was one of the 24 babies in the hospital’s neonatal ward, which had to be moved from the flooded ground floor to a chapel one floor above. The chapel’s 28 pews have been turned into makeshift beds for mothers, some of whom are so weak themselves that they lie with IV drips in their arms. While the city of Tacloban is the hardest hit, other towns, such as Palo, on Leyte island province, have also been badly affected and left without aid as roads have been left strewn with debris . According to the national disaster relief agency, nearly 4 million people have been displaced by the storm . Japanese medical teams have been treating wounded and vulnerable people as they wait for mercy flights to take them away from Tacloban's ruined airport . Today the British destroyer HMS Daring arrived in Cebu, a port near to Tacloban, to start providing emergency aid. The ship is carrying 500 shelter kits, 10 tonnes of high energy biscuits and will use its water filers to fill 1,900 tankers with clean drinking water. It joins a team of 12 British doctors already helping the survivors, as donations to the UK's crisis appeal have topped £33million, with another £30million being pledged by the government. Some victims have had to wait for days to be rescued by aircraft, such as this US C-130 military cargo plane, before being taken to Manila, capital of the Philippines . Any building still standing is being used to treat survivors like Edgardo Palma, who is seen here inside a school in Palo, Leyte island province .","Althea Mustacia born five days after Typhoon Haiyan hit Philippines .

"Rudy Giuliani is doubling down on his controversial comments about 'black-on-black crime,' saying he saved thousands of African American lives by cutting the murder rate during his tenure at New York's mayor. 'The danger to a black child in america is not a white police officer. That's going to happen less than 1percent of the time,' he told Fox and Friends this morning. 'The danger to a black child, if it was my child, is another black - 93percent of the time it's going to be another black.' Giuliani is under fire for comments he made on 'Meet the Press' on Sunday during a heated argument about race and crime in America. During a discussion about the protests over a white police officer shooting dead an unarmed black teen in Ferguson, Missouri, he told Georgetown professor Michael Eric Dyson: 'White police officers wouldn’t be there if you weren’t killing each other.' Scroll down for video . Not backing down: Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said he saved the lives of more African Americans than any mayor in city history by dramatically reducing the murder rate . Dr Dyson, a frequent MSNBC contributor, called Giuliani a 'white supremacist.' Others quickly chimed in online to say that the 70-year-old's comments were racist. Giuliani is refusing to soften his stance. In an interview today on Fox News he said that by reducing the violent crime rate - and the number of African Americans being murdered in New York City - he did far more for the black community than black pundits and activists. He further implied that Dr Dyson was a racist for focusing on the shooting in Ferguson and not 'black-on-black crime.' 'It's a matter of whether you want to be some kind of racial demagogue, who I consider a racist, which many of these people are ... or whether you want to be fair and decent and really save people's lives,' he said. He unabashedly defended his record as New York City mayor. Crime plummeted dramatically during his tenure from 1994 to 2001. 'I probably saved more black lives in this city than any mayor in the history of New York City, with the possible exception of Mike Bloomberg, who was there for 12 years,' he said. Sound off: Rudy Giuliani appeared on Meet the Press and turned a segment about racially proportionate police forces in the wake of Ferguson to say white cops wouldn't be needed 'if you weren't killing each other' 'We've tried to make the police force of New York City as proportionate as we possibly can. We go out of our way to do that. I think we do a pretty good job, not a perfect job.' He quickly diverted from that subject, arguing with MSNBC contributor and Georgetown professor Michael Eric Dyson about black crime. 'I find it very disappointing that you're not discussing the fact that 93 percent of blacks in America are killed by other blacks,' said Giuliani. Giuliani did not mention the source used, though a study from the Bureau of Justice Statistics found in reported crimes from 2005, 93 percent of black murder victims were killed by someone black. The study also found in the same year that 85 percent of white murder victims died at the hands of a white person. Dyson pushed back against Giuliani, calling the link made by the mayor a 'false equivalency.' 'First of all, most black people who commit crimes against other black people go to jail,' Dyson said. Back and forth: On a segment about racially proportionate police, Giuliani first stated he worked to keep a balanced force, then later argued in favor of more white cops in black neighborhoods . 'Number two, they are not sworn by the police department as agents of the state to uphold the law,' he added. Giuliani took off his glasses and cut in to argue  for more police in black neighborhoods as Dyson questioned officers' ability to effectively police those communities. 'The police presence cannot make a distinction between those who are criminals and those who call the police to stop the criminals,' he stated. The segment eventually turned into both talking over each other while Anthony Gray, attorney for Michael Brown's family, sat silent, before Giuliani capped his rant. 'Why don’t you cut it down so so many white police officers don’t have to be in black areas?' Giuliani shouted. 'The white police officers wouldn’t be there if you weren’t killing each other.'","The former New York mayor was on Meet the Press to talk about racially proportionate police forces .

"A police investigation is underway in Auckland after a New Zealand newsroom was sent a vial claiming to contain Ebola in a suspected hoax. A New Zealand Police spokeswoman said the liquid in a small plastic bottle was sent to the New Zealand Herald mailroom in a suspicious package on Tuesday morning. It was secured by Auckland City Police and will be sent to Melbourne for testing, she said. Emergency services were called to the New Zealand Herald newsroom in Auckland, New Zealand after it was sent a suspicious package labelled Ebola . A police investigation is underway in Auckland after a 'jihadist group' sent the package in a suspected hoax . The vial is being forwarded to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, after it was sent to the office by a 'jihadist group', Sky News reported. The NZ Police spokeswoman said: 'The package contained some documents and the small plastic bottle. 'One of the documents made mention of Ebola. As a precaution, the bottle and its contents were secured by police and transferred to [the Institute of Environmental Science and Research] where it will be swabbed for DNA and checked for fingerprints before being sent to Melbourne for testing.' Results are expected within days, but police believe there is little threat to the staff who handled the package. New Zealand Herald group marketing director Liza McNally confirmed that an unaddressed package was sent to their Auckland office (pictured) on Tuesday . 'Police are often called to deal with and investigate the origins and contents of suspicious packages,' Detective Inspector Scott Beard said. 'The vast majority of them turn out to be benign but we don’t take any chances. This is no exception.'

"As an avid rugby fan, Prince William is well acquainted with the sport’s often bawdy humour. And when he was presented yesterday with a charity calendar, featuring women players in a variety of nude poses, he declared enthusiastically: ‘Very good shots… I can recommend this!’ So perhaps it was lucky for him that the Duchess of Cambridge was out of earshot at the time. Scroll down for video . Fran Bateman (left) shows an impressed Prince William the charity calendar featuring women rugby players . After flicking through the calendar  - which features women rugby players in a variety of nude poses - William declared enthusiastically: ‘Very good shots… I can recommend this!’ The couple had just finished watching the Wales versus Australia rugby union game at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. Kate, who is 16 weeks pregnant with their second child, had left the stadium, leaving William to attend a tea with former players, organised by the Welsh Rugby Charitable Trust, of which he is Patron. The calendar, featuring the ladies of Gwernyfed RFC, was presented to him by former ladies player Fran Bateman. William studied the front cover with a dutifully pensive expression. In the calendar, featuring the ladies of Gwernyfed RFC, two lady players mark the month of June with strategically placed boots . In August, the girls have a kit check. When William delved inside the front cover he roared with laughter – and held up one image to show another guest at his table . Fortunately, Kate (pictured) was elsewhere during the episdoe . But when he delved inside he roared with laughter – and held up one image to show another guest at his table. ‘He thought it was outrageously funny. He was having a really good laugh,’ Fran said later. It was William and Kate’s first visit to Wales since the announcement that they are expecting their second child. The Duchess accompanied her husband on two official engagements but took a turn for the worse after watching the game. The couple travelled to Wales, where they lived for three years, by car and helicopter and had had an early start. The Duchess was not travelling with a Royal doctor, and was accompanied and looked after by her private secretary. Earlier the Duchess, dressed in a pale blue Matthew Williamson coat, showed off a very compact baby bump when she and William toured the Pembroke Refinery in Angle. Hundreds of well-wishers braved the rain and waved Welsh flags at the couple as they arrived. Although the couple left 16-month old Prince George at home they were given a plastic model of a fuel tanker, complete with the number plate ‘4 GEORGE’ by workers. Will Prince pay penalty for revelling in rugby strip-tease? Let's hope she forgives him in time for Manhattan tour . Three years after their first transatlantic visit, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are returning to the US. The Mail on Sunday can reveal that William and Kate – who visited Los Angeles shortly after their wedding in 2011 – will embark on a three-day trip to New York next month to unveil their new charity, United For Wildlife. And it seems likely they will take 16-month-old Prince George with them. Pregnant Kate, who was forced to withdraw from a visit to Malta in September because she was suffering from acute morning sickness, has now been cleared to travel. William and Kate – who visited Wales yesterday – will embark on a three-day trip to New York next month to unveil their new charity, United For Wildlife . She is said to be ‘very excited’ about the forthcoming trip – her first visit to the city – having been desperate to see New York since she was a young girl. The Duke and Duchess will meet conservationists to discuss illegal poaching and will also sit down with officials from international charities, including the World Wildlife Fund. A spokesman for the charity said: ‘We will be in New York to talk about our Wildlife Crime Project, which is why the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are involved.’ The couple’s representatives from United For Wildlife have just returned from a reconnaissance trip and an announcement about the visit will be made imminently. ‘Kate has never been to New York and she is really looking forward to it now that she is over her illness,’ a source tells me. Another source adds: ‘Kate was upset she had to cancel her tour of Malta, but now she is over her morning sickness and really excited about America.’ Kate visited an oil refinery in Wales yesterday, her modest baby bump just visible beneath her elegant double-breasted sky-blue wool coat. She was at the Valero facility in Pembrokeshire with Prince William to mark the 50th anniversary of its opening. She is due to make two public appearances this week – the Royal Variety Performance at the London Palladium on Thursday, and a reception for her charity Place2Be. A Palace spokesman said: ‘Any overseas visit will be announced in the usual manner in due course.’","Prince William and Duchess of Cambridge watched the rugby in Cardiff .

"U.S. police are under pressure not only . for the killing of an unarmed teenager in Ferguson, Missouri - for which a grand jury decided yesterday not to indict the officer - but also for the military-style response to the . sometimes violent protests that followed. The sight in August of police in camouflage gear, backed up . by armoured vehicles and brandishing assault rifles, was a . reminder that some American police departments have recently . acquired U.S. military-surplus hardware from wars abroad.

Smart: London police constables Ben Sinclair and Karen Spencer pose for a photograph wearing their Metropolitan Police beat uniforms . Venezuela's Interior Ministry decrees that, when peaceful . methods of resolution have failed, police must warn violent . demonstrators that there will be a 'progressive, differentiated . use of force'. While no firearms must be carried for peaceful . demonstrations, when things turn violent, the emphasis is on . avoiding harm to children, pregnant women and the elderly. Afghanistan's police, often themselves the target of armed . attacks, are officially authorised to respond with weapons 'and . explosives', albeit only after other methods have failed, and no . fewer than six warnings have been issued. But for every regulation that gives police wide scope to use . firearms, there is another code that sharply limits their use. Mexican and Indian riot police follow defined escalation . protocols that go from verbal warnings to physical constraint, . tear gas, water cannon or pepper spray, rubber bullets or baton . rounds, and then use of firearms.

Rank and file: Austrian police officers pose in various uniforms in front of a water cannon at their headquarters in Vienna . Yet while Mexican police commanders can decide when to . escalate, India's Rapid Action Force requires approval from an . on-the-spot magistrate for each new step. Many countries spell out that any use of firearms is a last . resort, though this can be defined many ways. Britain, Serbia, Bosnia and the Philippines allow guns to be . fired only if a life is at risk. Britain stands out for its . insistence that 'individual officers are accountable and . responsible for any use of force and must be able to justify . their actions in law'. Other Western European countries, meanwhile, allow firearms to . be used 'where necessary' to detain suspects or to prevent a . serious crime.

Geneva are not subject to Swiss law but still conform to local . police rules. These rules, like those governing police in Italy, . Austria, Belgium and Bosnia, specify that the use of force must . be 'proportionate'. In Belgium, human rights monitors say, this means firearms . can never be used for crowd control.

The demand for yet another book from the former Manchester United manager is not surprising when sports psychologist Damian Hughes can trade on his name so blatantly with his publication How to Think Like Sir Alex Ferguson. Hughes, whose Ferguson study was the subject of an interview on Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday, has certainly stretched any tenuous association with either Sir Alex or Manchester United to the limit. Sir Alex Ferguson is being approached to write a management book based on his Harvard University lectures . The promotional literature originally claimed that the author had worked closely with Ferguson when it transpires that Hughes had never talked to him about the book and now ‘can’t remember’ the dates of any of the many conversations he says he’s had with Fergie. Hughes, a visiting Professor of Organisational Psychology at Manchester Metropolitan University, blames publishers Aurum for publicising his supposed working relationship with Ferguson and said he had that line withdrawn as soon as possible. However, Hughes has also claimed in newspaper interviews to have been employed as a junior coach at Old Trafford working with academy players alongside Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and ‘totally immersed in a winning environment’. But United have no record of Damian Hughes whatsoever on their academy files. Hughes later confirmed his role was with Man Utd Soccer Schools. The Fortress GB ticket scanner system installed at Twickenham is going to be a significant help with England Rugby 2015’s battle with the World Cup ticket black market — provided it works properly as it does at Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City. Glitches in the system led to huge queues to get into the stadium before Saturday’s England-All Blacks game. However, reading ticket barcodes will allow ER2015 to identify those supplied from unofficial sources and stop the holder from entering the ground. Campbell Ogilvie poses with the William Hill Scottish Cup . Scottish FA president Campbell Ogilvie  might still mount a home nations challenge for the British vice-president’s seat on the FIFA executive committee which is destined to be won by England candidate David Gill in the UEFA election next March. But even in almost certain defeat, Ogilvie is sure to be a lot more media friendly than Gill, who frequently treats the press with disdain. Meanwhile, it has emerged that Manchester United’s Gill was the main supporter of FA chairman Greg Dyke’s desire not to use headhunters to find the successor to general secretary Alex Horne until persuaded otherwise. The ultra-commercialisation of England rugby internationals at Twickenham included former England captain Roger Uttley being photographed with fans next to the Rugby World Cup to help promote packages being sold for the tournament by the RFU-owned England Rugby Travel Club. Dowd is alleged to have had favourable treatment . Dowd in the spotlight . Top referee Phil Dowd  is the latest official to face allegations from within the referees’ fraternity that he has received favourable treatment from the beleaguered Professional Game Match Officials Ltd. This follows calls for PGMO boss Mike Riley to be replaced in the continued fall-out from the Mark Clattenburg affair. Clattenburg was suspended for a game after leaving a match in his own car rather than the official vehicle and taking a call from Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock, but others have allegedly escaped punishment for similar breaches of regulations. It has been claimed that Dowd, who failed a fitness test at the end of the 2011-12 season before losing a noticeable amount of weight, didn’t pass a test at the start of this season. But he was allowed to carry on officiating after passing another test, which was quickly arranged with PGMO sports scientist Simon Brevik away from the usual venues. The PGMO insist Dowd did not fail a ‘test’, but they would not comment about him starting the test exercise but not being able to complete it because of injury. The PGMO added there is no designated location for fitness tests.","Sir Alex Ferguson has two best-selling autobiographies .
