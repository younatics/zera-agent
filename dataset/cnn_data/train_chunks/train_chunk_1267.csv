"Barack Obama has failed black Americans as unemployment soars to depression-era levels, a Republican presidential hopeful has claimed. Michele Bachmann said that unemployment among the black community has rocketed to 16 per cent during Obama's term. Shockingly, the African-American unemployment levels are the same as the depression era in 129 and up from 12.7 per cent when Obama was inaugurated in January 2009. Figures: Republic presidential hopeful Michele Bachmann said Barack Obama had failed blacks after African-American unemployment reached 16 per cent . Ms Bachmann singled out the figures during a scathing attack on the first black U.S. president at a talk in New Orleans over the weekend. 'Mr. President, the status quo is not working for Americans,' she said at the Republican Leadership Conference. 'This president has failed the Hispanic community. He has failed the African-American community. He has failed us all when it comes to jobs.' Ms Bachmann, who hopes to be the Republican presidential candidate, spoke at the event alongside the other current contenders Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum, Ron Paul and Herman Cain. Her figures were backed up by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Recent figures show that overall African American joblessness stands at 16.2 percent. For black males, unemployment is 17.5 per cent while black teenagers have a  41 per cent unemployment rate - up from 36.3 percent when Obama was elected. Overall unemployment in the Hispanic community was 9.9 per cent when Obama was inaugurated but by May 2011 it had risen to 11.9 percent. Among Hispanic 16 to 19-year-olds the unemployment rate was 24.3 percent in January 2009 and had risen to 26.1 percent by May 2011. Ms Bachmann targeted the area which is considered by many to be Obama's weakest area. Poor: Recent figures show that overall African American joblessness stands at 16.2 percent - up from 12.7 per cent in January 2009. Commentators suggest that his hopes of winning the 2012 election rest on how he can perform on key financial issues and reassure struggling Americans. 'The status quo certainly isn't working for the African-American community, with 16 percent unemployment, or the Hispanic community, with nearly 12 percent unemployment,' Ms Bachmann added, according to CNS. 'It's even worse for the youth: For Hispanic youth right now, 26 percent unemployment; for African-American youth, 40 percent unemployment. 'This president has failed the Hispanic community. He has failed the African-American community. He has failed us all when it comes to jobs.' The worrying figures emerged as leaders of a national Hispanic organization slammed  Obama for skipping their annual conference for the third consecutive year. He had previously promised in 2008 when he was running for election that he would return as president to speak. But the no-show has angered the group. Members of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials have also criticised Obama's earlier pledges on immigration reform after deportations actually increased during his term. The president is attempting to woo many Hispanic voters. The community has traditionally had low turn outs at elections but their influence could swing the final vote, commentators suggest. 'It is getting harder and harder for the president to go into a venue where he is confronted by Latinos because he is in a jam,' NALEO member Luis Gutierrez told Politico. 'In front of a group like NALEO, blaming Republicans for their intransigence on immigration reform and not addressing what the president’s own administration is doing to immigrants would not wash. So it isn’t surprising to me that the president is not showing up.'","Jobless rate same as depression-era in 1929 .

"For any homegrown tennis fan, watching Andy Murray battle his way through Wimbledon is a test of nerves - and the Duchess of Cambridge is no exception. The 30-year-old yesterday struggled to maintain her royal composure as she cheered on Murray during his quarter-final clash with Spain's David Ferrer. Sitting alongside her husband Prince William in the Royal Box on Centre Court amid a galaxy of tennis heavyweights, Kate looked to be thoroughly enjoying herself.

William will tomorrow be installed as Knight of the Thistle - the . highest honour in Scotland - at a special service in Edinburgh with the . Queen, Duke of Edinburgh, Princess Royal and his wife. Kate . recycled an outfit she wore on the couple's tour of Canada exactly a . year ago, donning a knitted sailor dress by Alexander . McQueen, teaming it with navy blue heels and a Jaeger clutch bag. The couple sat on the front row of the Royal Box with All England club chairman Philip Brook and his wife Gill. Their . visit completes a family set - on Tuesday Kate's parents, Carole and .

Judy Murray. He roared to victory over Ferrer and booked himself a place in the semi-finals after a nail-biting tie-break. He will now take on Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in tomorrow's semi-final. The . British number one was given a reprieve from the rain, playing in dry . weather apart from one brief delay, clinching victory with an ace. He did his now-trademark 'fingers to the sky' gesture as fans celebrated the win.

"Half of 26 to 35-year-olds were unable to correctly identify a vagina on a medical diagram of the female reproductive system, a new survey has found. In contrast, the majority of older women aged 66 to 75 were much better educated about their body parts. The study, by women’s cancer charity The Eve Appeal, found that less than a quarter of 16 to 25-year-olds said they felt confident  they were well informed about gynaecological health issues, compared to more than 42 per cent of women aged 66 to 75. Half of 26 to 35-year-olds were unable to identify a vagina on a medical diagram of the female reproductive system, as part of a survey carried out by women's charity The Eve Appeal. As Gynaecological Cancer Awareness Cancer month launches, The Eve Appeal are campaigning for young women to face up to embarrassment about gynaecological health, in order to prevent cancers. Currently 55 women are diagnosed with a gynaecological cancer every day in the UK. Shockingly, the charity found one in five women aged 16 to 25 surveyed couldn't name one  correct symptom of any of the five gynaecological cancers, which affect the womb, cervix, ovaries, vagina and vulva. Consult your GP if you suffer any of the following symptoms: . Young women found it difficult to talk about their body parts. Nearly 40 per cent of 16-25 year olds resort to using names such as ‘lady parts’ or ‘women’s bits’ to discuss gynaecological health and 65 per cent said they have a problem using the words ‘vagina’ or ‘vulva’. Worryingly, more than one in 10 of 16 to 35-year-olds said they found it very hard to take to their GP about gynaecological health, and nearly a third admitted they had avoided going to the doctors altogether about gynaecological issues due to embarrassment. These figures dramatically decrease amongst women in older age groups, debunking the popular conception that because society is more open these days young women can talk more freely about gynaecological health issues. Helena Morrissey, chairman of The Eve Appeal said she wanted women to talk openly about gynaecological cancers. She said: ‘At the Eve Appeal we know how important it is to promote straight talking about the signs and symptoms of gynaecological cancers to women of all ages, and this survey has highlighted just how far we still have to go to make this happen. ‘These cancers have some of the worst outcomes for women, with a 40 per cent mortality rate. 'Understanding the symptoms will save lives, which is why we are urging women this Gynaecological Cancer Awareness Month to talk more openly about these life-saving issues.’ Every day in the UK 55 women are diagnosed with gynaecological cancer.

"British interests: David Cameron has threatened to use veto . Prime Minister David Cameron today vowed to stick to his guns in demanding a European budget freeze, declaring: 'We've not put in place tough settlements . in Britain in order to go to Brussels and sign up to big increases in . European spending.' He made his position clear in the House of Commons hours after Germany denied seeking to cancel . next month's European Council summit if the UK threatened to . veto any rise in the EU budget. But speaking to MPs today, Mr Cameron insisted he had 'put down a marker' that he wanted to see a 'rigorous' settlement. And he insisted neither Britain or Germany was prepared to back further big rises in spending. 'I don't believe that German voters want that any more than British voters, and that's why our governments have led the argument in Europe for fiscal restraint,' he said. Mr Cameron said on Friday that he would not sign up to an agreement on the long-term EU budget for 2014/20 if it amounted to a 'bad deal' for Britain, sparking speculation that the negotiations may run into the sand. The Financial Times said German chancellor Angela Merkel was planning to warn Downing Street that she will have the November summit called off unless he is ready to show flexibility. But Mrs Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert today told a news conference: 'It is not true. I categorically deny this report. 'The German government has an interest in the success of this special summit in November and supports European Council president Herman van Rompuy in the goal to get an agreement on the long-term 2014-2020 budget.' Mrs Merkel is trying to persuade Mr Cameron to accept a German compromise which would cap EU spending at 1 per cent of European GDP, rather than the 1.1 per cent proposed by the European Commission. But the Prime Minister has made clear he does not see any case for a rise above inflation. It was reported that the German chancellor would use a visit to Downing Street early next month to tell Mr Cameron that there was no point in holding a summit if he insists on a veto. Clash: German Chancellor Angela Merkel . Mr Cameron's official spokesman said that the Government had received no communication from Berlin over any proposal to cancel the November 22 summit at which it is hoped to reach agreement on the budget. The PM's spokesman told reporters at a . regular Westminster media briefing: 'The Prime Minister has made it . clear that he is willing to do a deal on the budget in November, so long . as that is the right deal for British taxpayers. 'We have said that we don't see a case for increases in spending above the rate of inflation. 'Countries . around the EU are having to take some very tough decisions on spending. The level of public debt across the EU in 2012 is 50 per cent more than . it was in 2007. 'On average, countries are expecting spending as a percentage of GDP to fall by 8 per cent between 2010 and 2014. 'This . is a time when many countries are having to take some very difficult . decisions and that should be reflected in the discussions we are having . in the EU on the budget.' Wrangling . over the EU budget is likely to dominate talks which Mr Cameron will . have with Mr van Rompuy at 10 Downing Street on Thursday. Mr . Cameron set out his position at a Brussels press conference last . Friday. 'It just would not be acceptable to see a huge increase in EU . spending at a time when other budgets are being cut,' he said. 'If there isn't a deal that is good for Britain, if there isn't a deal available then there won't be a deal. 'We . cannot have European spending going up and up and up when we are having . to make difficult decisions in so many different areas.' The euro zone's fiscal deficit fell sharply last year as governments slashed expenses and raised taxes, but public debt still climbed, the European Union's statistics office revealed today. Fiscal or budget deficit is the amount governments must borrow to make up any shortfall in their budgets. Public debt is recorded as a percentage of its Gross Domestic Product - the value of all the goods and services produced by a country. Eurostat said the budget deficit in the 17 countries using the euro fell to 4.1 per cent of gross domestic product in 2011 from 6.2 per cent in 2010 - the first year of the debt crisis. Euro zone public debt, however, rose to 87.3 per cent of GDP in 2011 from 85.4 per cent, Eurostat said. The euro zone's biggest economy, Germany, slashed its budget deficit to 0.8 per cent in 2011 from 4.1 per cent in 2010 and its debt fell to 80.5 per cent of GDP from 82.5 per cent. Ireland reported a spectacular drop in the deficit to 13.4 per cent from 30.9 per cent as the one-off expense of shoring up its banking sector disappeared from its books. But its debt jumped to 106.4 per cent from 92.2 per cent. Greece, where the crisis started, had the highest debt in Europe last year, reaching 170.6 per cent of GDP even though it reduced its deficit to 9.4 per cent from 10.7 per cent in 2010 and 15.6 per cent in 2009. Spain reduced its budget deficit only marginally to 9.4 per cent in 2011 from 9.7 per cent in 2010. The 2011 figure is 0.9 percentage points higher than previously reported. But Spain's debt was still relatively low, at 69.3 per cent of GDP against 61.5 per cent in 2010. Italy, also under market scrutiny cut its budget shortfall to 3.9 per cent from 4.5 per cent in 2010. Its debt inched higher to 120.7 per cent from 119.2 per cent. Portugal, already on a euro zone financial lifeline after being cut off from market borrowing, more than halved its budget deficit last year to 4.4 per cent of GDP from 9.8 per cent as a result of reforms, but its debt jumped to 108.1 per cent from 93.5 per cent.","Came hours after Germany denied threatening to cancel European Council summit in response to UK demands for EU spending freeze .

"Mark Zuckerberg defiantly pushed forward with the overhaul of Facebook this afternoon as he announced more radical changes to the site with completely new profile pages covering years before the site even existed. The site founder unveiled some of the biggest changes in the site's history with the introduction of the new 'timeline' profile pages at the company's f8 conference in San Francisco. The announcement came as Zuckerberg continues to face wide scale anger from users at the way that the news feed was changed at the start of the week. Scroll down for video . Unveil: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg introduces Timeline during his keynote address at the Facebook f8 Developers Conference in San Francisc . New profile: The redesigned page looks more like an online scrapbook and users can add photos to their 'timeline' from before Facebook existed, such as photos of their birth . The new timeline feature is reminiscent of an . online scrapbook, with the most important photos and text that users . have shared on Facebook over the years. The timeline can go back to include years before Facebook even existed, so users can add photos and events from, say 1995 when they got married or 1970 when they were born. Zuckerberg said the new profile page had been designed so that, 'you can tell the whole story of your life on a single page'. The redesigned pages have a more magazine-like photo-heavy feel, with a large 'cover photo' at the top of the page . On the right of the page there will be a . timeline that breaks down all posts from a person's time on Facebook . and allows viewers to jump back to people's earliest posts with a break down month-by-month. Features: The profile page has closer integration with apps such as Netflix and Spotify, allowing users to watch films and listen to music on Facebook . For the first time, the site will allow you to add photos and content from before Facebook existed in a new 'Way Back' section. In his presentation, Zuckerberg showed how to add a baby photo at the beginning of your timeline. 'It's fun and easy to fill out your timeline,' said Zuckerberg. In other changes to the profile page, . users will be able to choose what is featured on their timelines, with . the ability to star favourites to double their size or hide things . altogether. Zuckerberg took the stage after a humorous skit, in which Saturday Night Live actor Andy Samberg impersonated him. Changes: The new 'timeline' profiles will look more like an online scrapbook with a much larger space at the top of the page for a profile picture . The real Mark Zuckerberg looked . considerably more playful and at ease than he has in past events, . suggesting he is growing into his role as the public face of Facebook. But . he quickly got down to business as he introduced the timeline as 'the . story of your life - all your stories, all your apps and a new way to . express who you are.' Expanding on its ubiquitous 'like' buttons, Zuckerberg said Facebook will now let users connect to things . even if they don't want to 'like' them. 'We . are making it so you can connect to anything you want. Now you don't . have to like a book, you can just read a book,' he said. 'You don't have to like a movie; you can just watch a movie.' Timeline: The right hand side of the site has been changed to show a chart of posts from the past . The . latest changes come days after Facebook overhauled the news feed . feature, which largely succeeded in goading its 750 million users into a . fury. Users . have been infuriated by the overhaul of the site with dozens of . Facebook groups set up to protest the changes - some with thousands of . members. On . Facebook's official blog more than 7,000 users have offered comments on . the new 'update' to the news service - many of them furious rants in . capitals - and a mere 1,800 users have 'Liked' the service. Tech . sites are offering 'workarounds' to disable the new features - and many . users have said on Twitter and Facebook that they are switching to . using Facebook on smartphones such as iPhone, where the the new News . Feed and News Ticker have not yet been added to the apps. The . focus of most people's anger seems to be the arbitrary way in which the . site 'chooses' which stories might be 'important' to you - general . opinion is that the site seems to invariably choose wrongly. All change: Zuckerberg has made several announcements this week as the site has faced competition from the likes of Google+ . The new update to the site 'splits' news into 'top stories' - the company declined to explain how these are . chosen for each individual - and a 'news ticker' that crawls up the . right side of the screen, adding updates as they come in. 'I want to choose my own news and my own friends. I do not need Facebook to choose these items for me,' said one commenter. 'News Feed is awful.  It's . taking me much longer now to find the news I really want, now that . Facebook has decided incorrectly that some algorithm knows better than I . do,' said another. Although Facebook is still the . world’s largest social networking site with 750million users, it has . been under pressure from Google and other media sites for a number of . months, especially since the launch of Google+. Watch the video . Spoof: SNL's Andy Sandberg introduces the new fake features while pretending to be Mark Zuckerberg . Before Mark Zuckerberg launched the latest changes to the site, 'Saturday Night Live' cast member Andy Samberg took to the stage to introduce two new fake features. Wearing Zuckerberg's usual attire of a hoodie and sandals, Samberg did his impersonation of the Facebook founder, which has become a regular feature on the show. 'Let's get to the part where I brag about user growth,' Samberg said. 'We continue to expand to the point where we've stop counting you guys. 'It's more than the population of Europe, the cast of 'Glee' and the . amount of people claiming they came up with Facebook. Burn!' Samberg then introduced the 'I'm not really friends with these people' section of the site. The fake Zuckerberg said the new feature would be a place on your friends list to put people that you feel obligated to be friends with, but that you do not really like. 'It's the perfect place to put awkward friends from middle school, older drunk women you meet at charity events, racist neighbours, and aunts,' he said. Then he revealed the 'slow poke', which is a poke that moves so slowly that you can take it back if for example you gave the poke while drunk. 'The Slow Poke' gives users 24 hours to 'realise you're an idiot' before it is sent to the friend. The real Zuckerberg then took to the stage interrupting the monologue saying, 'drop the act now, man'. 'The slow poke isn't even a real feature,' Zuckerberg said while chuckling. 'The deal . was I was supposed to feed you real information through the earpiece.' &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;br/&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; .","Networking site pushes forward with major overhaul despite protests .

"An actor who appeared in classic gangster films such as 'The Godfather Part II' and 'Goodfellas' sued a local deli in El Cajon, California, accusing them of stealing his name and likeness to promote an Italian-style sandwich. Frank Sivero, 62, who played the characters of Genco Abbandando in 'The Godfather Part II' and Frankie Carbone in 'Goodfellas', sued the deli and its owners in Los Angeles Superior Court last week. The dispute centers on the deli's use of his likeness in promotional materials, as well as the 'Frankie Carbone' sandwich the deli sold. Frank Sivero (pictured left) is suing a California deli that allegedly used his name and likeness to promote a sandwich named after Frankie Carbone (pictured right), a character in the 1990 classic 'Goodfellas' A picture of the Frankie Carbone sandwich, posted by user 'Amanda H' on Yelp while enjoying the Italian treat with a pickle . According to Sivero, he visited the deli in early March of last year, and agreed to take pictures with patrons after his meal. A few months later, Sivero claimed that he was tipped off that the deli posted his pic on their website, as well as their Facebook and Yelp pages.  This in addition to naming a sandwich after him. In the complaint, Sivero sued Deli Belly, as well as the owners Robert E. Bahri and Vinson N. Gaggo. Sivero alleged that he never gave the partners permission to use his likeness in their ads, and that he was never paid for it. According to the complaint, 'Plaintiff has developed and cultivated [his] rights to create . universal recognition and value. Defendants have, without any right, . title, or authorization, misappropriated and infringed on plaintiff's . rights for the aforementioned commercial purposes.' Sivero is seeking an injunction on the deli using his name and likeness, in addition to compensatory and punitive damages. The owners of Deli Belly did not immediately respond to MailOnline's request for comment. The exterior (pictured left) and interior (pictured right) of Deli Belly, located in El Cajon, California .

No pictures with Sivero could be spotted on any of their websites as of Sunday morning. The deli is highly rated on Yelp, sporting 4.5 stars out of five with 48 reviews. One review, dated October 1, 2013, called the Frankie Carbone 'by far one of the top 3 Italian subs I've ever had!' In the movie 'Goodfellas', Sivero's character was involved with a large robbery of the JFK Airport in New York. He is killed off by Robert De Niro's character James Conway, and they find his body inside of a meat locker, where he is so frozen it takes him 'three days to thaw out for the autopsy.'","Sandwich named after Frankie Carbone, played by Frank Sivero, in the 1990 gangster movie 'Goodfellas'

"Using in-built 'factory reset' and 'delete-all' services on phones with Google's Android operating system is not enough to cleanse them of personal data, new research has revealed. Experts found they were able to pull tens of thousands of photos, emails, text messages and more from used phones being on eBay that previous owners had thought they had 'wiped' clean. The findings suggest that mobile owners should be much more thorough if they are planning to sell their phone to prevent their data being accessed. Scroll down for video and tutorial on how to erase data from your phone . Prague-based internet security firm Avast has discovered a huge flaw in Android phones. They found they were able to recover large amounts of personal data (image supplied) with publicly available programmes from used phones they bought on eBay that had seemingly been 'wiped' by the previous owners . • More than 40,000 stored photos . • More than 1,500 family photos of children . • More than 750 photos of women in various stages of undress . • More than 250 selfies of what appear to be the previous owner's manhood . • More than 1,000 Google searches . • More than 750 emails and text messages . • More than 250 contact names and email addresses . • Four previous owners’ identities . • One completed loan application . The study by Avast Software, a Prague-based internet security firm, found they could easily retrieve personal data from smartphones sold online, despite consumers deleting their data. Aside from 40,000 photos and 250 ‘compromising’ selfies of men, the company was even able to discover the identity of several sellers, and one person’s completed loan application. The huge multitude of data was recovered from just 20 used smartphones, highlighting just how much data can be retrieved from a small number of used phones. These were phones where the previous owners had performed a factory reset or a ‘delete all’ operation on their devices with in-built software. Despite doing this, however, Avast was able to gather vast amounts of data. Only one phone had third-party security software installed, and it actually gave up the most personal information of all. In . response to the findings, Google said: 'This research looks to be based . on old devices and versions (pre-Android 3.0) and does not reflect the . security protections in Android versions that are used by the vast . majority of users. 'If . you sell or dispose of your device, we recommend you enable encryption . on your device and apply a factory reset beforehand; this has been . available on Android for over three years.' The huge multitude of data was recovered from just 20 used smartphones. Aside from 40,000 photos and 250 'compromising' selfies of men, the company was even able to discover the identity of several sellers, and one person's completed loan application . The phones were all bought from eBay (image shown). These were phones where the previous owners had performed a factory reset or a 'delete all' operation on their devices with in-built software, apparently to no avail. More than 80,000 used smartphones are for sale daily on eBay in the U.S., according to Avast . To recover the data Avast used programs called FTK Imager, a disk imaging programme, and SuperSU, an app management programme. In one example, Avast explains how they recoevered ‘deleted’ messages from a Facebook chat from an HTC Sensation smartphone. ‘The amount of personal data we retrieved from the phones was astounding,’ said Jude McColgan, President of Mobile at Avast. ‘We found everything from a filled-out loan form to more than 250 selfies of what appear to be the previous owner's manhood. ‘We purchased a variety of Android devices from sellers across the U.S. and used readily available recovery software to dig up personal information that was previously on the phones. ‘The take-away is that even deleted data on your used phone can be recovered unless you completely overwrite it.’ 1. CNet recommends that you encrypt your device before wiping it, which can be done in the ‘Security’ section of the ‘Settings’ menu. 2. Next you’ll want to perform a factory reset, which is done in the ‘Backup & reset’ section of the Settings menu. 3. For added protection you then need to load your phone with ‘dummy’ data, such as stock photos and video, so people can’t steal your identity. 4. Now perform another factory reset, erasing the dummy data. Repeat this three times or more to be as secure as possible. 5. Your data is not only now buried beneath dummy content, but if someone does get that far into your phone they’ll find it is encrypted as well. One solution to this problem is to repeatedly perform factory resets on the phone. This should be done after encrypting it, which can be done from the settings menu. The phone should also be loaded with dummy data, so if someone does gain access they have to get through multiple levels before finding personal data . More than 80,000 used smartphones are for sale daily on eBay in the U.S., according to Avast. ‘Along with their phones, consumers may not realise they are selling their memories and their identities,’ McColgan adds. ‘Images, emails, and other documents deleted from phones can be exploited for identity theft, blackmail, or for even stalking purposes. ‘Selling your used phone is a good way to make a little extra money, but it’s potentially a bad way to protect your privacy.’","Prague-based firm Avast has revealed a huge flaw in Android devices .

"Big spender: Philip Blond withdrew £40,000 from his think tank's coffers to fund a jet-set lifestyle . David Cameron’s former Big Society mentor was facing embarrassment yesterday over claims he ‘raided’ the coffers of his own think tank to pursue a jet-set lifestyle. Phillip Blond, stepbrother of James Bond actor Daniel Craig, was revealed to have withdrawn £40,000 to cover personal ‘expenses’. These included exotic trips abroad to meet women and £165 on a garish Regency-style chair decorated with pictures of women in bikinis and high heels sitting astride motorbikes. The payments came at a time when his fledgling think tank ResPublica was struggling to pay its rent and staff wages. It also that emerged Mr Blond once ‘treated’ Cabinet Office minister Oliver Letwin and his wife to tickets for a performance of The Magic Flute without mentioning they had been paid for by the company which owns the Canary Wharf complex. A friend of Mr Blond last night acknowledged that the 45-year-old academic theologian, who is not married, ‘enjoys the good life’ but insisted he had ‘done nothing wrong’. ResPublica insisted all the money had been properly accounted for. Styles himself as the ‘Red Tory’, and is credited with inspiring the Prime Minister’s vision of a Big Society . Mr Blond, who styles himself as the ‘Red Tory’, is credited with inspiring the Prime Minister’s vision of a Big Society. He has carved out a reputation as a moralist, blaming Thatcherism for creating a damaging ‘Loadsamoney’ culture, and accusing New Labour of promoting values ‘essentially of personal pleasure and the pursuit of self-interest’. Earlier this year he was awarded the Family Values Award by the Mormon church for his work in promoting marriage. But leaked details from ResPublica suggest Mr Blond has not always practised what he preaches. He asked a fellow academic to give a Ukrainian woman he was pursuing £300 in cash. The . academic responded: ‘What I could do is buy her a nice scarf or . something and put the cash in there so it’s not too obvious.’ Policy: David Cameron has pushed his 'Big Society' scheme but it has so far failed to capture the public's imagination . Friends said the money was to help the woman, who is now Mr Blond’s girlfriend, get over a burglary. Mr Blond also spent £1,690 to fly out for a rendezvous with the woman at the Swiss Inn Resort in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. In March last year he flew to Brazil to meet another woman at the luxurious Porto Galinas resort, sending pictures of her in a bikini to his academic friend. He also compared notes with his friend on a ‘hot Spanish journalist’ from a Catholic newspaper. The details are believed to have been leaked by a disgruntled former member of staff. Mr Blond, who rents a £4,100-a-month flat in the King’s Cross district of London, is paid a salary of £60,000. But as ResPublica’s sole director and shareholder he is legally entitled to pay himself a hefty dividend from the profits. The organisation’s accountants are said to have advised him to convert his £40,000 of personal spending into a dividend payment. ResPublica said Mr Blond paid himself a ‘low base salary’, choosing to take the rest of his remuneration in dividends. It apologised for an ‘oversight’ in not informing Mr Letwin who had paid for his hospitality at the opera.","Flew to Brazil to meet woman at luxurious resort, sending pictures of her in a bikini .

"Strewn with algae, dirt and graffiti, they are a sad echo of a very British golden age. Some of the country's grandest swimming baths lie abandoned and derelict, as documented in stunning new photographs by Italian-born photographer Gigi Cifali. The 37-year-old was captivated by the urban decay of Britain's pools, which took off during a boom for public swimming in the late Victorian era. Many stayed open for more than 70 years, but have been forced to shut by dwindling numbers, council cuts or high-spec gyms. Scroll down for video . Nature has begun to take over at Manchester's Harpbury Baths, which opened in 1910 and closed in 2001. These incredible images by Gigi Cifali, 37, show the decline of Britain's swimming baths  and lidos, which once numbered into the hundreds. Public baths saw a surge in popularity from the Victorian era but many have since closed . Hornsey Road Baths in Holloway, London, which opened in 1932 and closed in 1988. The pool is pictured in a dire state, with filthy water in the deep end. The photographer said: 'I fell in love with these decaying, dry buildings. I thought I could stand with my camera inside the pools and tell the story from the swimmers' point of view' At a monstrous 73 yards long, Uxbridge Lido, London, opened in 1935 and included a unique 12-sided star shape in its centre. The pool shut in 1998, and for years was left strewn with dead leaves and graffiti. It has since reopened with many of the Grade II listed features restored and was used as a training pool for the 2012 Olympics . Mr Cifali stood in the shallow end of former pools and lidos in London, Solihull, Manchester and Birmingham for a series called Absence of Water. Some had been closed only a few years before he began his project. The Tudor Grange Pool in Solihull was drained and demolished in 2007 to make way for a new leisure centre. Others had been closed for more than 20 years when Mr Cifali launched his project, including Hornsey Baths in London, which shut its doors in 1988. He said: 'I fell in love with these decaying, dry buildings. I found some great examples of forgotten baths and pools. 'I thought I could stand with my camera inside the pools and tell the story from the swimmers’ point of view. 'Standing inside the pools, I realized how these places represent an authentic testimonial to bygone times. 'They were in vogue places, and fundamental to life years ago.' Lidos - which draw their name from the Italian word for beach - exploded in popularity in Britain from the end of the 1800s. The craze reached its peak in the 1930s, when councils across the country built more than 150 of the outdoor pools. On summer days, revellers in traditional full-body bathing suits and caps would jostle for space on stone and concrete promenades. There was a surge too in indoor pools, which gave more serious-minded swimmers space to practice. With high arched ceilings and hundreds of seats for spectators, they continued to be built beyond the Second World War. The spectacular marble-lined Soho Marshall Pool in London opened in 1931, in a congested area of the capital not accustomed to wide open space. It shut in 1997 for redevelopment and has since reopened as the centrepiece of the Marshall Street Leisure Centre, with many Grade II listed original features retained . It is more than 20 years since the closure of Eltham Park Lido in south east London, and it is showing its age. Opened in 1924, it was once a haven for outdoor swimmers. The decline of public swimming means 10 pools in London have closed since 2010, though another 24 have re-opened, according to figures from Sport England . Birmingham's Mosley Road Baths opened in 1907 and closed almost a century later, in 2004. Since then the ornate Edwardian building has been at the centre of a fierce battle between history-lovers and Birmingham City Council, which initially said it could not afford the repairs. Earlier this year former Liberal Democrat councillor Martin Mullaney vowed to chain himself to the building in protest. It now appears the pool may have won a reprieve, with locals still bidding for Lottery funding . Oldham's Chadderton Baths, which opened in 1937 and closed in 2006, are popular with historians and local photographers if not swimmers. The once gleaming white pool and arched ceiling now show signs of age, though the striking black-and-white image of a diver on the rear tiles still looks as clear as the day it was made . As Britain advanced through the 1970s, 80s and 90s, the pools' popularity waned. Ten swimming pools have closed down in London since 2010 alone, while 24 have opened, according to figures from Sport England. Mr Cifali, who moved to London from Italy in 2002, said: 'Gradually, living conditions and tastes changed, resulting in a drop in attendance, leaving the public pools uneconomical to run. 'Many fell into decay and many were demolished. They were symbols of civic and architectural pride in Victorian times. Today only a handful of them remain. 'The series allows us to reflect on water and its importance it has for the development of human society.' Forest Hill Baths in London were open for almost a century since 1907. The Edwardian pool closed for health and safety reasons in 2006 when problems with the roof were identified, and has since been demolished. Like many old pools, it has been replaced with a state-of-the-art new leisure centre, which opened last year . Solihull's Tudor Grange Pool opened in 1965 and closed in 2008. Though newer than some pools, it too was demolished and replaced with a new sports centre . Bathers at the Egerton Lido in Bexhill, East Sussex, pictured left in June 1939; right, bathers shiver before jumping into the Serpentine in London's Hyde Park . Outdoor swimming was not confined to the big cities. Here hundreds of swimmers jostle for space at the bathing beach lido in Plymouth, Devon, in 1935 .

"David Cameron dropped plans to put a cap on the number of EU immigrants allowed into Britain after being ‘sat on’ by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, a former minister said today. The Prime Minister announced last week that he would ban migrants from claiming benefits for four years after moving to Britain. But he failed to include a controversial ‘emergency break’ on migration if the benefit cuts did not lead to a fall in the number of EU workers moving to the UK. Former Environment Secretary Owen Paterson today said he did not think Mr Cameron could ‘deliver’ even his watered-down pledge. He said: ‘It looks as if we’ve already been sat on by the Germans.’ Scroll down for video . David Cameron pledged to cut the level of EU migration to Britain in a speech  at JCB World Headquarters last week . In a further blow to Mr Cameron – just days after his set-piece immigration speech – leading Eurosceptic Tories will now table a bill on Wednesday to override the EU’s principle of free movement of workers. It comes amid claims 200 Tory MPs want to leave the European Union. Tory veteran Sir Bill Cash has warned that at least two thirds of the 303 Conservatives in the Commons now want to leave. Mr Paterson – a leading Tory favouring Britain’s exit from the EU – told the Prime Minister he had to ‘deliver’ on his promise to cut benefits for migrants. He added: ‘It’s quite clearly impossible for a country like ours to absorb 260,000 new immigrants net every year, it’s putting a terrible strain on public services and causing real social problems.’ ‘This is a real pressing problem. We cannot go into long, rambling negotiations with the European Union, particularly if they’re not going to play ball.’ He described the current situation as a ‘fork in the road’. It comes amid claims that Britain could be forced to pay benefits to even more migrants despite Mr Cameron’s speech. Officials in Brussels last night confirmed that the European Commission is taking legal action to make Britain lift existing restrictions that prevent some migrants claiming child benefit and child tax credit in the UK. The news comes just days after David Cameron pledged to cut handouts in a bid to reduce soaring immigration. The case at Europe’s highest court will further anger the public and politicians who have called on the Government to tighten up Britain’s generous welfare system and make the country a less attractive destination for would-be immigrants. German chancellor Angela Merkel allegedly vetoed plans by David Cameron to impose a cap on the number of EU migrants allowed in to Britain each year . If Britain loses, it will either have to change the law to allow jobless migrant families to claim child benefit, or face paying millions in fines. Latest figures show 24,000 families are currently claiming child benefit of at least £89 a month for 38,500 children living abroad, at an estimated cost of £30 million a year, while 4,000 claim child tax credit. On Friday, the Prime Minister pledged to end the ‘exporting’ of child benefit, as well as to ban migrant workers from claiming tax credits until they have worked in the UK for four years. Last night Nigel Mills, one of the Conservative backbenchers demanding a tough limit on EU migrants, said: ‘Free movement is about the right to work, not the right to claim benefits. The EU should accept our rules are the will of the British people and Parliament.","PM announced  he would ban migrants from claiming benefits for four years .

"Thousands of mobile phone users were left unable to use their phones following a blunder by the BBC's consumer advice programme Watchdog.

"The global chief executive of McDonald’s has claimed he lost 20lbs in weight – despite eating from the chain’s menu every day. Don Thompson said he regularly worked out at a gym to lose the pounds but did not stop wolfing down the fast food meals  whenever he could. But his claims were met with scepticism on Twitter with some branding it the ‘McDiet’ and  asking him to ‘prove it’. Weight loss: The boss of McDonald's, Don Thompson, pictured, has claimed he's shed 20 pounds in the past year wile eating at his fast food restaurant 'every, single day' Last week McDonald’s unveiled its . most unhealthy item ever, the Mega Potato, which is a double size . portion of fries. At 1,142  calories it is more than half the . recommended daily calorie intake for a woman. Mr Thompson said he shed the weight over the course of a year by getting up early in the mornings and going to the gym. The fast food boss insisted he still . ate at McDonald’s ‘every single day’, although he did not specify what . he chose from the menu. He admitted that despite McDonald’s . trying to rebrand itself as healthier, its salads make up only two to . three per cent of sales. But he claimed the company was making efforts to include more vegetables in its meals. Thompson, who has been on the job for less than a year, was responding to a question about how the company is adapting amid growing concerns about obesity when he pointed out his slimmer frame. He said that he lost the weight by getting active again and noted that it's rare to see Europeans that are 'very, very heavy' because they walk a lot. 'And so I think that balance is really important to people,' he said. 'I don't see salads as being a major . growth driver in the near future,' Thompson told investors in New York . on Wednesday, according to Bloomberg News. It's no wonder the salads have failed to lure health conscious diners when they are often as . fat-laden as a Big Mac and boast names such as Bacon Ranch and . Southwest Crispy Chicken. Salad: McDonald's has already dropped two salads from its menu and will likely drop more after the dismal sales performance . New focus: The chain's CEO said it will likely refocus advertising on burgers and chicken sandwiches which sell better than salads . In comparison to poor salad sales, the restaurant's Dollar Menu generates 13 to 14 per cent of U.S. business, he said. But . he claims the company isn't giving up on selling fruit and vegetables. For instance, some of McDonald's new McWraps have tomato, cucumber . slices and shredded lettuce inside, he said. McDonald's first added tossed salads to its U.S. menu in 1987. Bloomberg News reported earlier this month that it is considered ditching Caesar salads after it already got rid of Fruit & Walnut salads from its menu this year. McDonald's shares fell more than 2.2 per cent to close at $98.28 on Wednesday, after the announcement. At one point they declined as much as 2.9 per cent for the biggest intraday drop since October 19 and they continued to fall on Thursday.

The world's biggest hamburger chain announced it was axing its Fruit & Walnut salad in March after competitors Burger King Worldwide Inc and Wendy's Co began closing the gap with McDonald's.

"After Tiger Woods' former caddie made a racist remark at a awards dinner, he was condemned by the Professional Golfers Association and Tiger Woods' management team, but it's Adam Scott's lack of criticism that has people talking now. Williams was given an award for the . year’s best celebration - a reference to his tongue-in-cheek claim that . his current employer Adam Scott’s victory at the Bridgestone . Invitational in August was ‘the best win of my career’ - despite being on the bag with Woods for 13 majors. Asked . what the celebration was all about, Williams said: . ‘It was my aim to shove it right up that black a**hole.’ New boss: Williams with Adam Scott  on the 16th hole during the first round of the WGC-HSBC Champions at Sheshan International Golf Club this week . Though Williams issued an apology, people are now criticizing Williams' new boss Adam Scott's lack of criticism. Scott, who now retains the 47-year-old New Zealeander caddie, said that he disapproves of Williams' remark, but is trying to put the whole incident in the past. 'I don't think anyone condones racism in sport or anything,' Scott said. 'I don't see it being an issue moving forward,' Scott said. 'I think from my side of things and my teams, the matter has been put to bed. I've got nothing more to talk about it with anyone. So I'm moving on.' 'I had Steve issue an apology. What more should I do?' Scott continued. 'Look, anything with Tiger involved is a story,' Scott said. 'I value Steve's contribution to my game and to have him on the bag.' Mark Steinberg, Woods' agent at Excel Sports Management, was with the golfer when he heard the news. He said: 'It's a regrettable comment, and there's really nothing that Tiger can do or say. He's just going to move on.' The comment was met with a mixture of laughter and shock at the ceremony, with some players turning to each other with eyes widened and jaws agape. One caddie said: ‘Never have you been in . a room and seen so many jaws drop at the same time. We knew he was an . idiot but we didn’t know he was a racist idiot. I was standing next to a . European Tour official who said, “Thank God he is not on our tour”.’ Blast: Williams and Tiger Woods worked together for more than 10 years . Approached early the next morning at breakfast, Williams was stunned to learn that British tabloids had gone with the story. 'Why would they do that?' he said. 'The whole thing was meant to be fun.' He then posted a statement on his website saying: 'I apologise for the comments I made . last night at the annual Caddie Awards dinner in Shanghai. 'Players and caddies look forward to . this evening all year and the spirit is always joking and fun. I now . realise how my comments could be construed as racist. 'However I assure you that was not my intent. I sincerely apologise to Tiger and anyone else I have offended.' The 100 caddies, players and guests in attendance had accepted their invitations on the condition they did not disclose what happened at the ceremony, held after the second round of the WGC-HSBC Champions tournament. Williams, who could now face a ban or even the sack, had been a regular caddie . for Woods since 1999 and helped the American to 13 majors before being . fired in July. He hit out at the . manner of the split and a month later was in the news again after his . new employer, Scott, won the WGC Bridgestone Invitational at Akron, . Ohio. Centre of storm: Steve Williams stunned guests at a gala dinner with a racial slur when accepting a prize for 'best celebration' Williams had told reporters: 'It's . the most satisfying win I've ever had, there's no two ways about it. It's the greatest week of my life caddying and I sincerely mean that.' He later apologised for those comments, saying his emotions got the better of him.

"The Government is planning to  mitigate the damage caused by adding VAT to pasties by introducing a new ‘green’ tax on chilled champagne. A Green Paper leaked today proposes a ‘Thermal Reduction Initiative (Champagne)’ that would add a nine per cent duty to all chilled champagne sold in public places. If implemented, the average price of a bottle sold in a restaurant  would rise from £37.50 to £40.86. Topped up: An unidentified delivery man waits to deliver boxes of champagne to 11 Downing Street . Chancellor George Osborne  plans to present this as an environmental measure. Experts agree that champagne is best served at about 43 to 48F (6 to 7C). This can be achieved by placing a room-temperature bottle in a fridge on a medium setting for three to four hours. However, this increases the carbon footprint of the typical wine bar by 0.05 per cent. Multiplied many times over the course of a typical evening, the Green Paper argues, this is  a significant amount. Chancellor George Osborne plans to present the move as an environmental measure . According to the Government, some establishments in the City of London, and in Alderley Edge, the Cheshire village infamous as a playground for footballers’ wives, use as much energy chilling champagne in a single evening as  a medium-size hospital expends on light and heating. Serving warm champagne, says No 10, is good for the environment. The TRIC attack on champagne drinkers could be seen as a political manoeuvre to counter angry concerns that the ‘pasty tax’ was  an upper-class assault on a working-class snack. But the sight of ten crates of champagne being delivered to No 11 Downing Street ahead of the ‘bubbly tax’ is unlikely to convince voters that ‘we’re all in this together’. Meanwhile, wine merchants are demanding to know why champagne is targeted but not prosecco and cava, as bar owners and restaurateurs protest over what they see as an attack on their livelihoods. And the Liberal Democrats say that they have always been against the levy – but claim they successfully lobbied their Coalition partners to exempt Pomagne and Babycham. A host of Facebook pages have been set up to oppose the measure. ‘Tax Chavs, Not Champagne’, purporting to have been created by the Bullyboy Club, the notorious Oxford drinking society for aristocrats, has attracted more than 800 ‘likes’. Another, called ‘Chill, Dave!’, claiming to represent staff at the investment bank Credit Reckitt, has 500 supporters. A group of backbench Labour MPs hurriedly formed their own protest group which they gleefully named ‘The Champagne Socialists’, all  memories of Alistair Darling’s politically damaging cider tax of 2010 conveniently forgotten. Pastygate: David Cameron became embroiled in a pasty tax fiasco when he was apparently caught telling fibs about his love of the hot snacks . The Champagne Socialists’ chosen spokesman was, perhaps inevitably, Frank Beers, MP for Theakston South. He said in a statement: ‘Champagne is what toffs quaff. If the Tories want to punish the people who vote for them with this brut-al tax, that’s their look-out. On the other hand, why shouldn’t the working man have a glass of bubbly? After all, he’s earned it. Cheers.’ And the newly elected MP for Bradford Park, George Gallowgate, of the Respeck party, and a teetotaller, declared: ‘This Government  has popped its cork, lost its fizz and gone flat. It is a government of champagne Charlies in a parliament of pusillanimous poltroons. It is a tyranny of tipsy tycoons.’ But the Government has already started to backtrack. A Cabinet source said: ‘Look, this was something dreamed up by the PM and George over a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon ’66 to try to show that they’re just regular guys. ‘We never said it was going to  be policy. Nobody takes Green Papers seriously. They’re just for larks, really. ‘There’s no doubt that March has been a very bad month for us but we’re going to draw a line under it and move on. ‘We won’t be April fools.’","'Thermal Reduction Initiative (Champagne) would add 9% duty to all chilled champagne sold in public places .

"An Indian woman accused of strangling an 11-month-old British baby in Dubai has denied murder. The 30-year-old nanny is accused of strangling the baby girl with a scarf as an act of revenge on her employer when she was not allowed holiday. After previously confessing the crime to prosecutors, the nanny is now pleading not guilty to premeditated murder saying she loved the girl ‘like her own children’. Trial: The 30-year-old Indian nanny is accused of strangling the 11-month-old baby girl with a scarf in their Dubai home as an act of revenge on her British employer when she was not allowed holiday (stock image) ‘Sir, I did not kill that baby,’ the woman told presiding judge Ezzat Abdul Lat at Dubai Court of First Instance, according to Gulf News. ‘I loved her like my own children. I am a mother of two kids and there is not way on earth I would or could have done such a thing. ‘I was tortured while I was in detention. I have suffered a lot because of this case. I swear I did not commit anything wrong.’ The 36-year-old mother of the baby is originally from India but who holds a British passport. Speaking at a previous hearing, the mother said: 'We treated her so well, she was like a sister to me, we ate on the same table.' Pleading: The babysitter told presiding judge Ezzat Abdul Lat at Dubai Court of First Instance that she had loved the 11-month-old 'like her own' Her husband, who has demanded death penalty added: 'We celebrated her birthday and took her out for an ice-cream treat after we bought her some gifts. 'I often told her that I would pay for whatever her children need back in India and I was even looking for a job for her husband to bring him here so they can be together.' The babysitter previously confessed to the crime, saying she strangled the baby girl with a scarf because she had been refused days off. However, appearing at Dubai Criminal Court earlier this year, she denied premeditated murder. The maid's mother had died a month before the murder, which took place on January 18, and she wanted to travel back to India for the funeral. Her employers, who were unable to get time off work, told her to delay her trip until her residency documents for staying the the UAE were completed. The prosecution alleges that after being refused time off, the maid killed the baby to ensure she would not be needed for childcare duties and would therefore be allowed to travel.","Babysitter accused of strangling 11-month-old girl with a scarf in Dubai .

"Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone was at his most hyperactive as last season's Champions League finalists were given a major shock in Leverkusen. Hakan Calhanoglus's 57th minute strike was the least the Germans deserved in a fiery encounter that saw arm-waving Simeone argue with the fourth official, former Chelsea man Tiago sent off and 10 yellow cards. Atletico sub Fernando Torres was also booked late on after becoming involved in a scuffle in which he shoved Son Heung-Min. Hakan Calhanoglu's sensational strike earned Bayer Leverkusen a 1-0 win in the first leg of the last-16 clash against Atletico Madrid .

Bayer Leverkusen: Leno, Hilbert, Spahic, Papadopoulos, Wendell, Bender (Rolfes 68), Castro, Calhanoglu (Brandt 87), Son, Bellarabi, Drmic (Kießling 80). Subs not used: Reinartz, Boenisch,  Kresic, Donati. Goals: Calhanoglu 57 . Bookings:  Papadopoulos, Borges, Castro, Bender, Kießling . Atletico Madrid: Moya, Juanfran, Miranda, Godin, Siqueira (Gamez 38), Tiago, Gabi, Turan (Torres 64), Saul (Raul Garcia 42), Griezmann, Mandzukic. Subs not used: Suarez,  Oblak,   Gracia Calmache, Gimenez de Vargas. Bookings: Godin, Gamez, Torres, Tiago. Red Card: Tiago 75 . Referee: Pavel Kralovec . It wasn't a good night overall for the Spaniards. Emir Spahic hit the Atletico crossbar and Madrid striker Mario Mandzukick forced to clear off the line as the Liga champions looked a pale shadow of the side who came within seconds of European glory last season before losing in extra-time to neighbours Real. With Arsenal target Lars Bender pulling the strings for Leverkusen, the home side dominated in their all-red strip roared on by a vociferous capacity crowd of 30,000. The arm-waving Simeone bellowed at his defenders when Spahic hit the woodwork from 25 yards and then complained to delegates when his skipper Gabi was taken out by two German defenders. Tempers were frayed on both sides with Leverkusen defender Kyriakos Papadopoulos booked for jostling referee Pavel Kralovec after being penalised for a foul. Leverkusen were rewarded when a clever back-heel by Karim Bellarabi set up Calhanoglu who lashed his finish into the roof of the net from 10 yards. Simeone responded by sending on Atletico's prodigal son Torres for his first Champions League action for 10 months. Torres had a 75th minute header ruled out because Madrid's corner had gone out of play and then Tiago picked up a second yellow for a crude lunge at Bellarabi. Atletico, third in La Liga, turned up at the Bayer Arena as favourites but were immediately pinned back by a red tide. They knew Leverkusen were up for it when holding midfielder Bender made a rare venture forward and though he sent his shot wide, an excitable Simeone came to the edge of his technical area to wave his arms furiously at his defenders.

In Leverkusen's next attack after 12 minutes, Wendell's strike was goalbound until centre-forward Mandzukic produced a timely hoof off the line. Atletico were seconds away from completing a La Liga-Champions League double last May, conceding a late equaliser in the European final to Realwho went on to win 4-1 in extra-time. Top scorer Diego Costa has since departed even though Torres is back and was among the subs last night, their usual intensity was more than matched by their German opponents. Leverkusen are sixth in the Bundesliga and with skipper Bender marshalling the side in front of the back-four, they were the better side. After 25 minutes, the Atletico crossbar was left shaking by Spahic's piledriver that had goalkeeper Miguel Angel Moya beaten. As the Spaniards grew increasingly rattled, Tiago – a former Chelsea man - was booked for a cynical trip in midfield which did nothing to restrain Simeone's routine on the touchline complete with oustretched arm gestures and exasperated shouts. It wasn't just him though – Leverkusen were so frustrated at not making their supremacy count, five of them angrily surrounded Mr Kravolec for awarding a foul against Papadopoulos.

Leverkusen boss Schmidt (left) hugs match-winner Calhanoglu after the game as the hosts secured a shock win over Atletico . The Greek defender was so incensed he appeared ready to push the official over until a yellow card waved in his face forced him to back off. Atletico's first proper chance arrived after 39 minutes when keeper Bernd Leno had to claw the ball away as French international Antoine Griezmann was set to head in Arda Turan's cross. And just before half-time, he made an even better save from Tiago with his left hand that had Atletico's Portuguese international still holding his head as he walked off for half-time. They were rare forays though. The irony is that Leverkusen were less dominant in the second half but that is when they scored with Turk Calhanoglu almost breaking the back of the net with his finish. Josip Drmic almost added a second and the bad blood lasted until the final whistle when Torres was chopped by Spahic and sought retribution by shoving Son Heung-Min when he got up. It looked like Torres had got the wrong man but was booked for his trouble.","Bayer Leverkusen will take a lead into the second leg of their last-16 Champions League tie against Atletico Madrid .

"Police have let another home intruder walk free on the grounds he was drunk and high on drugs when he broke in to a disabled man's house at 3.30am. John Pearson was woken by his dog barking and was horrified when he realised a stranger had forced his way into his conservatory. The 59-year-old, who suffers from degenerative disc disease in his spine, chased the younger man out of his semi-detached house and called the police. Anger: Homeowner John Pearson, who is registered disabled, chased the intruder from his home at 3.30am . Alarmingly, the intruder returned minutes later and tried to get back in but was caught by the police who escorted him off the property in Sturminster Newton, Dorset. Mr Pearson said when he called the police . the next day he was shocked to learn they were taking no further action . against the man because he was drunk and was on drugs at the time. It is the second similar case involving . an intruder escaping prosecution on the basis that they were intoxicated at . the time they entered a stranger's house. Mr Pearson, a computer programme engineer, claims he was told by officers the man had mistaken the house for his own. Earlier this week we told how police released another drunk  intruder who had broken into the home of  Tim Ferris, 53 . But it is thought the suspect lives in a village nine miles away, although he is believed to have family living about a mile from Mr Pearson's home in Sturminster Newton. Earlier this week, estate agent Tim Ferris, 53, told of his fury after he trapped a suspected burglar inside his home near Maidstone, Kent, only for the police to later let the man go because he was drunk. On that occasion, Kent police had seemingly accepted the man's explanation that he had drunkenly mistaken Mr Ferris' house for his own. Mr Pearson, who was offered £10 compensation following the break in, said he fears there is a worrying trend of people getting away with minor offences on the basis they are drunk. He said: 'I think people are getting away with things just because they are have been drinking and taking drugs. This is a pattern we are seeing more of. 'If someone was to swear at a police officer they would be arrested but it now seems to me that if you enter someone's property, you get a lift home so long as you have been drinking.' Mr Pearson lives with his wife Lindsey, their 14-month old son and a 15-year-old foster child. He said his intruder, who was aged in his 20s, had damaged a wooden fence to climb into his back garden before using a dog flap to enter the property. Mr Pearson said: 'I came downstairs at about 3.30am when my dog started growling. I was about to go into the kitchen when I saw the man in my conservatory. 'I went out there and started shouting at him and he ran off, so I chased him but couldn't get very far as I'm registered disabled and can't run well. 'I phoned the police and woke up my wife and as I was talking on the phone he reappeared at the back door and tried to get in again, my wife was terrified. Mr Pearson, 59, who was offered £10 compensation, said he was shocked to learn . police were taking no further action against the man because he was . drunk and was on drugs at the time . 'I flew outside and he ran off again and straight into the police. 'But when I spoke to them the next day I was appalled to find out he wasn't going to be charged. 'They said he was on ketamine and alcohol and that he thought my house was his own and didn't know what he was doing. They said it wasn't worth charging him.' Since the incident in February, Mr Pearson has been offered £10 in compensation . from the intruder via the police as part of a 'community resolution' scheme. Mr Pearson refused the gesture. A spokeswoman for Dorset police said: 'We dealt with this incident as criminal damage as the level of crime met the criteria for community resolution. 'The level of crime was not of that to be dealt with through the court. 'Mr Pearson was offered £10 in compensation from the man through the police, and the compensation amount is determined on each individual case. 'An inspector who has dealt with this matter spoke to Mr Pearson very recently and at length. 'He explained to him why the decision was made for a community resolution to the crime and why it was not appropriate to charge the offender. 'Mr Pearson was satisfied with the explanation and did not want to pursue any further complaint.'","The intruder was reportedly drunk and high on horse tranquiliser ketamine .

Skills: Experts say there is a lack of well-trained sheepdogs, which is why Midge was so expensive to buy . Midge . is so valuable because she comes from a family of outstanding . sheepdogs, has been trained by a former world champion breeder and has . become well known for her speed and agility as well as her ice-cool . temperament. Also, a large . drop in trainers means that getting a top class sheepdog is getting more . and more difficult - and increasingly expensive. Her price, reached at Skipton Auction, . North Yorkshire, smashed the previous record of 6,000 guineas - £6,300 - . also achieved at Skipton last year for 13-month-old Dewi Fan.

"The president of a Florida university won the ire of much his student body on Sunday with an email that suggested sexual assaults can be blamed on booze and promiscuity. Eckerd College president Dr. Donald Eastman, 69, told the St. Petersburg college's 1,800 students to avoid rape by abstaining from casual sex and avoiding alcohol. Outrage: President of St. Petersburgh's Eckerd College, Dr. Donald Eastman, has infuriated students with an 'open letter' that blames booze and casual sex on rape . 'Virtue in the area of sexuality is its own reward, and has been held in high esteem in Western Culture for millennia because those who are virtuous are happier as well as healthier,' Eastman wrote. The email appeared to be in response to a growing national conversation about rape--and more specifically, the sexual assault problems on many college campuses--but not everyone found the president's words helpful. Some think just the opposite. 'I'm pretty p***** off,' sophomore Marlene Heyning, 19, told the Tampa Bay Times. 'That's a pretty insensitive thing to say.' Most of the ire Eastman has generated comes from what appears to be his blaming student culture for sexual violence. 'You know that these incidents are almost always preceded by consumption, often heavy consumption, of alcohol, often by everyone involved in them,' he wrote. Not everyone knows, however. 'I don't think casual sex is in any way related to sexual assault; the problem is people breaking boundaries and not learning respect from a young age,' said 18-year-old Katie Wheeler. Alumnus Joshua K. Wheeler, who started a Change.org petition urging President Eastman to address the controversy, agreed. 'I believe that laying the blame solely at the feet of the two issues you mentioned is an injustice to those affected by sexual assault, and will not solve the problem,' wrote Keeler, whose petition had over 70 signers by Thursday morning. Few, if any, students, have come out to support the president's letter. However, some appear to believe he meant well, at least. Eastman told the Gulf Coast school's 1,800 undergrads that 'virtue in the area of sexuality is its own reward, and has been held in high esteem in Western Culture for millennia' 'I don't think he meant any harm, but he didn't put it very well,' student Erica Worth told WTSP. 'He used the words ""casual sex"" but that doesn't necessarily have anything to do with sexual assault. He just used the wrong words.' Specific to casual sex, the president wrote: . 'No one's culture or character or understanding is improved by casual sex, and the physical and psychological risks to both genders are profound.' In an interview with the Tampa Bay Times, Eastman largely just restated what he'd already said in the letter. In response to the backlash, he only challenged his critics: if its not booze and floosiness, what does cause rape? 'But so far,' Eastman said, 'they haven't told me what you really ought to blame it on.' Dear Eckerd College students, . As you know, the College has launched an educational and awareness campaign to attempt to . minimize sexual harassment and assault in our community. The goal is to raise the awareness of . all community members with respect to sexual harassment and assault and to help prevent those . incidents by that increased awareness. You also know that our College is not alone in its concern about such behavior, principally . among its students. And you know that these incidents are almost always preceded by . consumption, often heavy consumption, of alcohol, often by everyone involved in them. You can do your part in helping this College and this culture address this nexus of problems by . doing two relatively simple things: . 1. By limiting your own consumption of alcohol, and encouraging your friends to do the same. Socrates included wine at his Symposium, but he did not get drunk. 2. You can be thoughtful about the dramatic and often negative psychological effects that sexual . activity without commitment can have. Virtue in the area of sexuality is its own reward, and has . been held in high esteem in Western Culture for millennia because those who are virtuous are . happier as well as healthier. No one’s culture or character or understanding is improved by . casual sex, and the physical and psychological risks to both genders are profound. Every year at the end of the Eckerd College Commencement ceremony, I say to the graduating . class, “I hope you feel not only well taught, but well loved. We will miss you.” I mean every . word of that. This open letter is written in that spirit – not as preachment, but with great affection . and true, deep and lasting concern. As always, I am available for your responses or a visit to my office. I wish each of you good luck . in your final weeks of the semester, and a happy, healthy, virtuous 2015. Sincerely, . Donald R. Eastman III . President . Source: Tampa Bay Times .","Eckerd College President Dr. Donald Eastman caused a stir on the St. Petersburg campus with an open letter he sent Sunday .

Paige Jackson (right), 22, who was 28 weeks pregnant, was killed instantly and an emergency caesarean section failed to save her baby, Reuben . But they later said the punishment would never make up for the ‘life sentence of grief’ they had been left with. Leicester Crown Court heard Miss Jackson had already named her son, Rueben, who died despite doctors carrying out an emergency Caesarean. The 22-year-old, who had danced professionally and aspired to be a model, was killed shortly after setting off from home to walk to McDonald’s, where she was working extra shifts to earn cash in preparation for the birth. Care worker Mangove, 22, who had climbed behind the wheel that February morning after a ‘rough night’, failed to negotiate a gentle right-hand bend before ploughing into the road sign.Martin Hurst, prosecuting, said: ‘His wheels locked and he mounted the pavement, demolishing a road sign with two upright posts which acted as a ramp, causing the car to take off and rotate 360 degrees, landing on its wheels. Miss Jackson was 28 weeks pregnant with her son, who died despite an emergency caesarean section . ‘In the course of the flight he struck Paige from behind, causing massive injuries to her head, abdomen and leg.’ He said the baby, who would otherwise have been born normally, died despite doctors’ best efforts. Mangove was arrested at the scene and found to have 142 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The legal limit is 80 micrograms. He had been smoking cannabis. CCTV showed Mangove, from Leicester, was driving at between 71mph and 88mph in the build-up to the crash in the suburb of Aylestone. Miss Jackson, pictured with her fiance Kane Johnson, who said she was 'the most beautiful and kind woman' He admitted causing death by dangerous driving. Sentencing him on Friday, Judge Nicholas Dean QC said: ‘You were responsible for those deaths by the way you drove your car.’ Mangove would have faced a sentence of around 12 years had he been convicted after a trial. But he received a discount because he did not flee the scene and had pleaded guilty. After the hearing, the victim’s fiancé Kane Johnson, 23, said: ‘What he has done has devastated so many lives, not just the two that were lost. Paige was the most beautiful and kind woman – she was loved by everyone.’ Her mother Vanessa Freeman, 43, said in a victim impact statement read in court: ‘My grandson never even had a chance of life. The baby would have been loved so dearly by all the family.’ Miss Jackson was walking to a bus stop on her way to work at McDonald's in Wigston, Leicestershire, when Mangove's airborne car struck her from behind, killing her instantly .","Paige Jackson, 22, was 28 weeks pregnant when she was hit by the car .

"Labour MP Maria Eagle was 'ballistic' over motion Scotland should be allowed to vary 24-week upper limit as part of devolving powers to Edinburgh . Ed Miliband has been caught up in a furious Labour row over plans to let Scotland decide its own abortion laws. The proposal is outlined in the cross-party Smith Commission report on devolving powers to Edinburgh drawn up in the wake of the ‘No’ vote in September’s referendum on Scottish independence. But the suggestion that Scotland should be allowed to vary the current 24-week ‘upper limit’ for terminating pregnancies sparked a blazing row at last week’s Shadow Cabinet meeting. Senior frontbencher Maria Eagle, who has opposed a reduction in the abortion time limit, led calls for the proposals to be thrown out. Witnesses said the Shadow Environment Secretary banged the table and hit out at the male-dominated Commission who were drawing up the plans. She said: ‘This is outrageous. What we’ve got is a bunch of men deciding on women’s rights to abortion.’ Pro-abortion activists fear that Scotland, with its strong Roman Catholic tradition, could insist on its abortion regime being tightened if given the chance. They fear this in turn could lead to Scottish women travelling to England for terminations. A Labour source said there was ‘panic’ at the behind-closed-doors Shadow Cabinet meeting when they were told the Smith Commission was poised to recommend handing over the abortion powers. One said: ‘Several people went ballistic – it wasn’t just Maria.’ The source said that Ms Eagle, MP for Garston and Halewood in Merseyside, was only placated when she was promised that the final Commission report would be ‘watered down’. The report – agreed after the meeting – still called for ‘serious consideration’ of the plan. But a Labour insider said: ‘This has effectively been kicked into the long grass.’ Last week’s row came against the backdrop of Ed Miliband’s party finding itself under huge pressure from a rampant SNP and amid dire predictions that Labour could to lose as many as 37 of its 41 Scottish seats at Westminster in next May’s Election.","Motion part of report on devolving powers to Edinburgh after referendum .

"Oguchi Onyewu is ‘gutted’ to have been left out of Jurgen Klinsmann’s provisional World Cup squad but hopes to resume his club career in England. The burly central-defender has been capped 69 times by the United States and played in the 2006 and 2010 World Cups but has rarely featured during Klinsmann’s reign after injuries hampered his progress. The much-travelled 32-year-old will be a free agent after playing on a short-term deal for Sheffield Wednesday. Experienced: Oguchi Onyewu has made 69 appearances for the U.S. and played in two World Cups . ‘I was gutted not to be selected for the World Cup. I thought this past season I’d done everything I could to get in the 30-man roster,’ Onyewu said. ‘I played 18 games with Sheffield Wednesday and played 90 minutes each time so I felt I’d washed away those injury concerns but life goes on.’ Onyewu’s World Cup hopes had been raised by a call-up for last year’s Gold Cup and then again for March’s friendly against Ukraine. ‘Coaches make their decisions, end of story. I’m not thrilled with the coach’s decision but you have to accept it,’ he said. Onyewu, who turned 32 on Tuesday, has played in France, Belgium, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Holland and had spells with Newcastle United and Queens Park Rangers. Onyewu says he wants to continue in England and even holds out hopes of a return to one of his former clubs. Omitted: After failing to make the 2014 World Cup squad Onyewu is considering his club future . ‘Right now no decisions have been made but I’m aiming to stay in the UK,’ he said. ‘It’s always a possibility that I will stay at Wednesday, but I want to weigh my options before I make a final decision. Who knows, maybe I’ll have the opportunity to play for Newcastle again, you never know.’ Onyewu moved straight from college to Metz in France in 2002 and has never played in Major League Soccer but he indicated that might be a destination before the end of his career. ‘If I had to play for an MLS team then first choice would be to come back home and play for DC United and after that one of the two New York teams or the Miami team.

"A seaside town which was one of many to suffer in the 1914 German bombardment will unite once again on the 100th anniversary of the attack to commemorate those who were killed. Following the bombardment 100 years ago, Britain was urged to 'Remember Scarborough!' in a number of campaigns following the loss of 18 people. Now, as the 100th anniversary approaches, the town is planning a number of special events to commemorate the centenary of the shelling. Scarborough is set to commemorate the 1914 German bombardment which killed 18 people and injured 200. Pictured: The Grand Hotel in 1914 . The 5th Battalion Green Howards pictured on duty at Scarborough Castle, where a maroon will be fired next month to commemorate the attack . The Leeds Rifles, a unit of the 19th century British Volunteer Force, march down Victoria Road in Scarborough after the 1914 German attack . On December 16, a maroon will be fired from Scarborough Castle after the name of each of the victims is read out at a special dawn ceremony in the town. The castle will be lit up during the ceremony and a flotilla of boats will be stationed outside the harbour. At another service, which will be held at Manor Road Cemetery, wreaths will be laid on a new cairn bearing the names of all those who died. Michael Knaggs, a volunteer at the Scarborough Maritime Heritage Centre, said the event will see Scarborough 'have another 15 minutes of fame'. The bombardment of Scarborough began just after 8am on the cold December morning almost 100 years ago, and two schools in the town were hit in the attack. However, due to the early hour and the winter weather, the number of casualties were fewer than they potentially could have been. Mr Knaggs said: 'If they had been hit a little later, a lot of schoolchildren would have died. 'At one of them, 200 children would have been killed easily. So in that sense, it was quite lucky that it was early in the morning.' However, 18 people were killed as a result of the raid, including 14-month-old John Shields Ryalls, which led Winston Churchill to call the Germans 'baby killers'. 100 years on: Homes destroyed by the bombardment on Scarborough's Lonsdale Road (left) have been transformed since the attack (right) The town will commemorate the 100th anniversary of the attack on December 16.

The outrage caused by the killing of innocent civilians led to the Government using the Scarborough bombardment in its recruitment drive. Mr Knaggs said: 'Its most important thing was the fact they used it publicity-wise to stir up bad feeling against the Germans after what had happened in Belgium earlier in the war. 'So, for propaganda reasons, it was very important.' One propaganda poster simply stated: 'Remember Scarborough! Enlist now.' Another, issued within weeks of the shelling, bore the headline: 'Avenge Scarborough - up and at 'em now.' The text added: 'The wholesale murder of innocent women and children demands vengeance. Men of England, the innocent victims of German brutality call upon you to avenge them. 'Show German barbarians that Britain's shores cannot be bombarded with impunity. Duty calls you now. Go today to the nearest recruiting depot and offer your services for King and home and country.'

Shop fronts were damaged and windows smashed, including those on Scarborough's South Street (above) during the attack in December 1914 . Scarborough's Wykeham Street (pictured) was targeted in the 1914 bombardment on the seaside town and nearby Whitby and Hartlepool . Posters were published in 1914 encouraging men to enlist after the  bombardment of northern towns Scarborough, Whitby and Hartlepool . Mr Knaggs said: 'At the time, Scarborough was a very famous holiday resort, lords and ladies and the royal family had been here. 'It was quite wealthy and so it was quite famous and everybody in Great Britain knew about Scarborough, so that's why the Government used Scarborough in all its 'Remember Scarborough', even though four times as many people died in Hartlepool and there was five times as much damage.' Four of the fatalities that day came from the same family and the Government used photographs of their house on its posters. Mr Knaggs said: 'Out of the 18 deaths, the four, the Bennett family in Wykeham Street, that was the most tragic. Four people out of seven in the one household.' Another victim was 15-year-old George Harland Taylor - the only Boy Scout to die in Great Britain during the First World War. In total, 18 people died in Scarborough and about 200 were injured. 'Over 200 buildings were hit, Mr Knaggs added. 'There were 776 medium format shells fired in 29 minutes, which is quite something.'

Sandbags block the road across Eastborough in Scarborough after the attack . Proposals to bomb England during the First World War were first made by Paul Behncke, deputy chief of the German Naval Staff, in August 1914. Many of the German bombardments focused on the east coast of Britain, with places such as Whitby, Hartlepool, Scarborough, Yarmouth, Lowestoft and Folkestone targeted. London was also besieged. The raids on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby, which took place on December 16, 1914, were attacks by the Imperial German Navy. In total, they resulted in 137 deaths and left 592 injured. The first successful raid of 1915 took place overnight between January 19 and 20 when two Zeppelins dropped bombs on Great Yarmouth, Sheringham, King's Lynn in Norfolk and the surrounding villages, killing four and injuring 16. Just over a year later came  the bombardment of Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft, also known as the Lowestoft Raid, which saw German and British troops battle in the North Sea. During the attack in April 1916, four battlecruisers opened fire on Lowestoft, destroying 200 houses which injured 12 people and killed three. The ships then moved towards Great Yarmouth where they fired more shells. In total, 21 British servicemen were killed at sea, while three civilians were killed and 19 were wounded at Lowestoft. Dozens of other raids on coastal towns and also on London were carried out during 1915 and 1916. The first daylight raid on London, on June 13, killed a total of 162 people, including 18 children, and injured 432 people.","Seaside town Scarborough set to commemorate those who were killed in German bombardment in December 1914 .

"A drag racer is lucky to be alive after her car burst into flames, in a spectacular explosion down the quarter mile, while doing almost 400 kilometres an hour, but incredibly she still won. Queensland drag racer Christine Steffens was up against Mark Sheehan in the three race Nitro thunder match race series at the Perth Motorplex on Saturday night. Steffens, an accountant who is based at Gatton, south east of the state, started off in the lead down the quarter mile in her green 'croc' Nitro funny car but soon got into trouble. Scroll down to video . The drag car burst into flames down the quarter mile at Perth Motorplex, it's believed the engine exploded . At top speed, ABC News said the vehicle suffered an engine explosion before it was engulfed by a fireball of flames. Luckily enough Steffens was able to escape via a roof hatch before the vehicle came to rest beside the safety barrier where smoke billowed out and flames continued to spread. Fire and rescue crews were shortly on the scene to extinguish the flames. It's believed after a quick pedal, the supercharger backfired, resulting in the fireball, which then sent a piece of shrapnel into a front tyre, which caused the car to swerve to the safety barrier.

"An Indian man who was caught trying to rape a teenage girl is in a critical condition in hospital after locals chopped off his genitals with a meat cleaver. Suresh Kumar was set upon in Ganganagar, in India's northwestern Rajasthan state, after locals heard the girl's screams for help. After finding the 40-year-old pinning the girl against a wall, a lynch mob dragged him to a butchers shop where they beat him with sticks for an hour before castrating him.

They then dumped the severed remains in the middle of a road and lefta bloodied Kumar nearby. Aamir Dhawan, 30, said no one 'went to help' Kumar because they knew he had been punished for a 'sex crime'. Mr Dhawan said: 'We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and it's time it stopped. 'This sends out a very strong message to anyone like that - if you do it you will be punished.' But the police have called for those responsible to come forward, saying people can't take the law into their 'own hands'. Kumar, middle, is stripped naked and awaits his fate, as locals record the punishment he is about to face . The spokesman said: 'As deplorable as these crimes are, law and order has to be maintained, and not lynch justice. 'We ask those men who carried out this attack to hand themselves in before we find them.' Kumar was eventually taken to hospital where doctors described his condition as critical. The girl involved was treated for shock, and given counselling. The castration follows a string of violent sex crimes in India that have prompted vigilante justice. In July, one man was killed and two others were badly hurt after being accused of raping and hanging a seven-year-old girl. The girl was discovered hanging from a tree near the village of Kaliabazar, West Bengal, and angry villagers quickly rounded up a local 'Tantrik' holy man and his two friends. The trio were mercilessly beaten. One later died in hospital and the two others required extensive treatment. That incident was a grim reminder of an incident in Badaun, Uttar Pradesh, some weeks before where two sisters were raped and then hanged from a tree outside their village.","Suresh Kumar was caught pinning a teenage girl against a wall .

"They say records are made to be broken, and unsurprisingly, attempts to surf the world's biggest waves are no exception. A group of daredevils have faced off with the giant waves at the Praia do Norte beach in Nazare, Portugal, where Garrett McNamara set a world record in 2011 for the largest wave ever surfed. Photos of yesterday's remarkable attempts to surf the site show riders being dwarfed by the waves as walls of water crash down behind them. Scroll down for video . The surf is best in the winter when Atlantic winds pick up, creating giant waves along the Portugal coast north of Lisbon. Pictured yesterday is a surfer dropping straight down the face of a wave . A surfer is pictured yesterday riding the base of the wave only metres away from the destructive and potentially deadly white water . The break has become a shrine for big wave surfers ever since McNamara set a world record three years ago by surfing a 78ft wave from trough to crest. The waves are formed when a 125-mile long underwater canyon up to three miles deep combines with strong Atlantic currents. In the peak summer months, the beaches of Nazare attract thousands of sun-seekers, but the scene transforms in the autumn and winter, as the Atlantic winds pick up, causing the waves to grow in size and power. The wild seas can prove dangerous though - local emergency services have had to rescue surfers knocked unconscious by the crashing waves in the past. The area attracts surfers from all around the world at this time of year, with some travelling from as far away as Australia and Hawaii to enjoy the giant waves. Two months ago a big swell brought another set of huge waves to the area. Pictured is a surfer coasting down the face of a wave on September 14 .

"Up to one million more Poles are considering moving to the UK to look for work during the next 12 months. The vast majority are young men aged under 35 who are dissatisfied with wage rates in their homeland, according to a new survey. There are thought to be at least 500,000 Polish-born people already living in the UK, and the survey suggests that number will continue to rise since relatively few of them are returning home. Nearly a quarter of those questioned named Britain as the country where they would most like to settle – up from 13 per cent at the beginning of the year. Germany is favourite, with 26 per cent naming it, and the Netherlands is in third place on 23 per cent. Countries with tougher border controls and work restrictions, such as the US, France and Australia, scored much lower, with only around two per cent choosing them. The survey, carried out by international market research company Millward Brown, indicates that one in every five Poles of working age is considering emigrating by the end of 2015 to improve their standard of living.

"More than half of babies are now born to mothers aged over 30, a report revealed yesterday. And one in five had mothers over 35, according to a breakdown of official data from the Office for National Statistics. The increasing age of motherhood means that the number of women having families in their late 30s or older could soon overtake those under 25. Scroll down for video . Overall 20 per cent of births were to mothers aged 35 or over, the new study from the Office for National Statistics said . It follows decades in which women have increasingly chosen to follow career and education opportunities and put personal ambition ahead of marriage and children. As a result, most babies born last year will have a mother in her 40s by the time they go to secondary school. At the same time a sharp drop in young mothers will mean fewer than one secondary school child in 20 will have a mother still in her late 20s in a decade’s time. The ONS report also showed a growing divide between the lifestyles of the new majority group of older mothers and those who still opt to have children before 25. The average age of mothers has risen across the board, notably for the first child reaching 28.1 years . More than two-thirds of older mothers have married and their babies are born into traditional families, the breakdown showed. But among the diminishing number of mothers in their early 20s, only one in five are married – and the figure was even higher for those under 20. The report said: ‘Almost all women – 96 per cent – aged under 20 who gave birth in 2013 were not married. ‘In contrast, at ages 30 to 39 the majority of women giving birth were married, with only 32 per cent of births outside marriage.’ Yesterday’s figures showed that 51 per cent of all newborns in England and Wales last year had mothers over the age of 30 – up from an average age of 29.8 in 2012. The figure has been rising since the mid-1970s, when a woman typically gave birth at an average age of 26.4. A first-time mother is now typically 28.3 years old. At the same time, the number of births to women under 25 is falling fast. Just over one in five babies – 148,855 in total – were born to younger women last year – half the number of 40 years ago. However, the number of births to women over 35 climbed to 140,658 – a level last seen during and following the Second World War at a time of enormous disruption to family lives. The great majority of babies, more than 400,000, were born to women aged between 25 and 39. The ONS report said the ages of mothers has been rising since 1973, reflecting the increasing number of women who have been delaying childbearing to later ages. Among the factors said to have influenced decisions over childbirth were ‘the instability of partnerships’. Births to unmarried women in their 30s have risen slower over the past 20 years than those in their 20s or their 40s. Overall just under half – 47 per cent – of babies were born outside marriage, compared to more than nine in ten in the early 1960s.","In 2013, 51% of all live births were to mothers aged 30 and over .

"A few months after Randy Lerner bought Aston Villa from Doug Ellis for £62.5million in 2006 the American passed on a message to Graham Taylor requesting a meeting. With more than 1,000 games under his belt as a manager, including two separate spells at Aston Villa, Taylor appeared to be the ideal sounding board for the club’s new benefactor. Nearly nine years on, after being left hanging about in a corridor following Villa’s 1-1 draw with Everton on April 2 2007, Taylor is still waiting to make his acquaintance. Graham Taylor on his first day as Aston Villa manager back in the summer of 1987 . Chairman at the time, Doug Ellis, welcomed Taylor back to Villa for a second spell in charge in 2002 . Randy Lerner, pictured with Ellis in 2006, did not keep his appointment with former Villa boss Taylor . ‘He sent Paul Faulkner (former chief executive) down to tell me he was busy,’ remembers Taylor of that bizarre incident at the beginning of the American’s tenure. Taylor is one of the lost generation, the 24 managers who have been on the touchline for more than 1,000 matches. Those cut adrift include some wise old heads, such as Dave Bassett, Steve Coppell, Graham Turner, Lawrie McMenemy, Neil Warnock, Denis Smith, Jim Smith and Taylor. They are not young and trendy or fashionable, and they do not talk about the ‘the group’, ‘the philosophy’ or ‘false nines’. But they do tell it how it is. Neil Warnock (right) always told it like it his during his time as manager at various clubs . Jim Smith (left) managed Portsmouth and later was Harry Redknapp's No 2 when they won promotion in 2003 . Those who have managed 1,000 or more domestic league and cup matches in first-team competition. Len Ashurst, Ron Atkinson, Dave Bassett, Alan Buckley, Sir Matt Busby, Brian Clough, Steve Coppell, Sir Alex Ferguson, Dario Gradi, Roy Hodgson, Brian Horton, Lennie Lawrence, Lawrie McMenemy, Harry Redknapp, Sir Bobby Robson, Joe Royle, Denis Smith, Jim Smith, Alex Stock, Graham Taylor, Graham Turner, Neil Warnock, Arsene Wenger, Danny Wilson . It seems such a waste, particularly when men of this experience will have dealt with, or confronted virtually every issue within the game during their managerial careers. The only two men alive with 1,000 games to their names and still in the technical area as managers are Arsene Wenger and Roy Hodgson. Sir Alex Ferguson, another member of that elite list of managers, was 71 when he won his last Barclays Premier League title with Manchester United. Sensibly, he has been made a director. The rest are the forgotten men of English football. Bassett won seven promotions during his career, but he has not worked in the game in a full-time capacity since he was assistant manager to Dennis Wise at Leeds in 2008. Coppell, one of the game’s great minds, has been out of work since leaving his position as director of football at League Two strugglers Portsmouth. At Reading, when he was named League Manager of the Year for the second successive year in 2007, he was tipped to become the England boss. Steve Coppell, the former Reading and Crystal Palace boss, is part of the 1,000 club . No doubt Jim Smith would have wished he was on hand to advise former Portsmouth owner Alexandre Gaydamak when he gave a toe-curling interview after swotting up on the history of the city when he bought the club in July 2006. Even Warnock, with six promotions in the Football League and recently sacked by Crystal Palace, should have something to give back to the game after a 34-year managerial career. These guys should act as mentors, leaned on in a professional capacity by young managers making their way in the game, or by some of the cavalier owners who buy English football clubs. True, it doesn’t help when knuckleheads like Joe Kinnear make a pig’s ear of things when they are given an unexpected opportunity, as he was when Mike Ashley named him director of football at Newcastle. Kinnear gives the others a bad name. Generally it is a young man’s game, but it does seem odd that 13 of the men on that 23-strong list (Sir Matt Busby, Sir Bobby Robson, Alex Stock and Brian Clough OBE are sadly no longer with us) are out of gainful employment. Sir Alex Ferguson, another 1,000 club member, was 71 when he won his 13th and final Premier League crown . There are others short of 1,000 matches - such as David Pleat or Graeme Souness - who have played in or managed dressing rooms at the highest level. Both articulate their views brilliantly. The sport is a booming business: Manchester United have 837 full-time employees according to their investor relations literature; Arsenal 548 (according to their 2014 annual report); Tottenham 368 (2013 annual report). Joe Royle (Everton’s professional development co-ordinator), Lennie Lawrence (assistant manager at Nottingham Forest) and Dario Gradi (Crewe academy) are still in the game. Royle, 65, puts in the motorway miles monitoring the young players out on loan from Everton’s academy. Arsene Wenger is one of two managers still working with 1,000 games under his belt . England manager Roy Hodgson is the other still plying his trade in the technical area . Joe Royle, pictured with Everton boss Roberto Martinez, remains a key part of the set-up at Goodison Park . He loves the role, but does not interfere in the work of head coach Roberto Martinez or chairman Bill Kenwright, and will only offer his opinion if it is sought. As a former Everton player and manager, a blue through and through, he is a valuable member of the team at Goodison Park. Last weekend Royle was up at Victoria Park to watch young Conor Grant (nephew of former Everton midfielder Tony) score on his debut for Motherwell during their 3-2 defeat by Ross County. At 65, Royle knows that his days as a manager are probably over, but he has a grounding in the sport that few can match after a lifetime in the game. Lerner, who is thought to be worth around £1.5bn after a life working with investment banks, knew nothing about football when he bought Villa from Deadly Doug. Tim Sherwood talks the talk at Aston Villa training... can the new man walk the walk and keep them up? Sherwood has a huge task on his hands after being given the reins at Aston Villa . The American has struggled to get to grips with the English game ever since. He could still learn a thing or two, despite employing a manager who is supremely confident of his own ability. ‘There are a lot of poor, experienced managers,’ reflected Tim Sherwood, who has become the fifth coach of Lerner’s ownership. ‘There are a lot of good ones too. I think it’s over-rated.’ What cannot be in doubt is the value of someone who has vast experience of handling difficult situations at a football club. Without them, it will be the same old story.","There are 24 managers who have taken charge of 1,000 games or more .

"On the day that would have been Phillip Hughes' 26th birthday, Australian cricket captain Michael Clarke has penned a touching letter to Sean Abbott, the man who was bowling when Hughes sustained his head injury. Hughes passed away on Thursday afternoon after being struck by a bouncer at the SCG on Tuesday, and since then tributes have flooded in from not just around Australia but from cricket fans and mourners worldwide. In a tribute reported by The Sunday Telegraph, Clarke has urged Abbott that the support of the nation is behind him during such a trying time, calling the tragedy a 'freak accident.'

But in perhaps the most moving aspect of the piece, the cricket captain offered bowler Abbott his personal support when the time comes for him to 'get back on the horse'. 'Sean, when you feel like getting back on the horse mate, I promise you that I will be the first to strap on the pads and go stand up the end of the net to hit them back at you. It’s exactly what Hugh Dog would want us both to do,' Clarke wrote. Aside from this touching show of solidarity, the Australian cricket captain also used the letter to express his gratitude for the wider Australian community, thanking them for the 'wonderful words of support for Phillip’s family and team mates'.

Hughes died on Thursday from the injures, and since then social media has been flooded with messages of support from around the world . He added that despite the fact that the Hughes family are currently facing unimaginable pain over the loss of the cricketer, they have taken comfort in the outpouring of grief from all corners of the world. Clarke paid tribute to Hughes' hometown of Macskville on the NSW north coast, acknowledging all those who nurtured his passion for cricket from a young age. 'From his junior team mates, to the coaches up on the north coast who noticed and nurtured his prodigious talent, to the umpires who would have tired of signalling his endless 4’s through point,' Clarke wrote in The Daily Telegraph. Clarke also paid tribute to those in Hughes' hometown of Macksville who nurtured his passion for cricket . Australia's upcoming test against India has been postponed so his teammates can properly grieve . He sent thoughts and prayers to all those grieving the tragic loss of such a young man doing what he loved, and said he had been moved by the 'best qualities' of Australians that had been on show this week. On Saturday Clarke delivered an incredibly emotional address which captured the grief so much of the nation is currently experiencing. Speaking on behalf of Cricket Australia the captain broke down in tears as he spoke about his 'little brother'. On the same day it was revealed that Australia's first test against India would be pushed back in order to allow the players to grieve. 'These are extraordinary circumstances and we simply couldn’t or wouldn’t expect our players to be emotionally ready to start a Test match the day after farewelling one of their teammates,' Cricket Australia CEO James Sutherland said.'","Michael Clarke has penned a touching letter to bowler Sean Abbott .

"Behind bars: Taylor Kelly, 18, has been charged with involuntary manslaughter after police say she fired a shot at a friend in a bulletproof vest - but missed . A South Carolina teenager was charged with involuntary manslaughter after police say she fired a shot at a friend in a bulletproof vest, but missed the Kevlar and struck him in the heart. Anderson County Sheriff's Lt. Shelia Cole said Blake Wardell, 26, found an old flak jacket early Wednesday morning in Greenville, put it on and asked 18-year-old Taylor Kelly to shoot him.

"Nestled quietly to the side of the M25, it appears to be like any other commuter village. But among the cluster of well-kept houses and  community centres lies a group of residents living life a little differently. For the people of Spielplatz in Bricket Wood, Hertfordshire, form one of the country's few naked villages, having lived in the nude for more than 85 years. Scroll down for video . A documentary exposing the lifestyle of a small community of naturists in a small village on London's commuter belt will be shown next month. Tina and Mark Yates (pictured above in the community's local pub) have been living in Spielplatz since visiting so that Mrs Yates could overcome body self-consciousness . Their lifestyle has been laid bare in a new documentary offering the outside world a glimpse into naturism. Among those enjoying life in Spielplatz - which means playground in German - is Iseult ­Richardson, 82, whose father founded the community in 1929. 'There is no difference between naturists and people who live up the street,' she insisted. 'We all live normal lives but are just lucky enough to live in this extraordinary place.' Properties in the village mainly comprise of two-bedroom bungalows which sell for £85,000, the Mirror reports. The couple are among 34 home-owners who live permanently at the site that is a stone's throw from the M25 . Everyday activities such as meal times and trips to the small, local pub are normally carried out in the nude . Wellington boots are reserved for gardening while residents can also choose to wear clothes if feeling chilly. Vic Lightfoot, the club's financial director, has trouble persuading girlfriend Maggie (pictured left) to strip off . Mark Yates in the community's entertainment room while his wife Tina goes outside for a dip in the pool . George, another of the residents, relaxes in the living room of his bungalow. The properties cost £85,000 . Residents also have the option to wear clothes if they want to when it is cold or they are doing daily chores . While residents prefer stripping off, they will adorn wellingtons, trousers or appropriate clothing when carrying out tasks like gardening. Trips to their own local pub, swimming sessions and meal times are all performed in the nude. Earlier this year one woman spoke of how life in the village cured her of body esteem issues. Tina Yates was self-conscious of a scar on her abdomen following an operation, and was taken to Spielplatz by her naturist husband in the hope it may cheer her up. Soon the pensioner had let go of all her previous body hang-ups, and the couple settled in permanently. While those living behind its fences are free of inhibitions, tensions are fraught over an ongoing debate about whether to force visitors to bare all when they come to see family.

"A 62-year-old man from Canada managed to survive for a week after suffering a stroke by drinking water from the toilet bowl. Steve Adsley from Dawson Creek, British Columbia collapsed in his bathroom and was paralyzed down his left side. Despite his cries for help nobody heard him. He ended up having to drink from the bowl of the lavatory until he was found by a neighbor seven days later. Survival: Steve Adsley from Canada who suffered a stroke ended up being stuck in the washroom and living off of nothing but toilet water for a week . Mr Adsley says that when he suffered his sroke he was paralyzed on his left side. His daughter, Melani (right) only found out a week later after calling the hospital . Mr Adsley, who lives in a condo unit says he was going about his usual routine when all of a sudden he fell. Jammed between the vanity and the toilet, the retired financial controller and father of three said he struggled to move his body but his entire left side was paralyzed. He yelled for help to his neighbors, but said he knew they were at work. 'I laid there, tried to get up. I couldn't get up. I couldn't put pressure on my leg, my arm,' he told CBC. He says that he had no idea what was happening. Melani Adsley speaks of her guilt over not sending someone to check on her father sooner. It was one full week before her dad was discovered laying on the floor of the toilet . Mr Adsley says the entire situation was very frustrating because nobody could hear him scream and he couldn't get up to flush the toilet either . 'I couldn't get on all fours because I had no feeling in my arm or my leg. 'Later on that night I figured out my problem was water. I didn't have anything to drink. So I unscrewed the bolts from the toilet, turned it into a little cup and could reach with one arm, just far enough in — and could put a little cup in the water in the bottom of the toilet bowl. So I drank that.' Mr Adsley says he didn't think he would survive the ordeal. He said he continued his yelling but grew tired, noting it’s not possible to yell for 24 hours. 'You can only yell for a couple hours and you lose your voice,' he said. 'You get too tired to yell.' Realizing his best chances of being heard were in the early mornings and evenings when his neighbors were leaving for or returning from work and were outside in the parking lot, Adsley said he waited for those windows of opportunity. 'I would yell, ‘Help, I need help,' as loud with ‘help’ as I possibly could, and I’d yell like that for about 15 minutes and then your voice gets weak,' he told The Province. He sais that he is now moving to live closer to his daughter, Melani, in Vancouver so she can check up on him easier . Weeks on since the incident, he has almost full recovered with feeling on his left side. Doctors say he should make a full recovery . He could hear his neighbors in the parking lot, and sometimes even their movements in the building, but said he felt like he was being drowned out. 'Yeah, after about Day 3, I figured I’m done,' he said. 'No one’s going to find me. I’m going to end up dying of thirst, I’m going to run out of water and I’m never going to be found.' At the end of the fourth day, Mr Adsley ran out of water because he couldn’t reach the lever to flush the toilet but he continued to yell. He continued to shout at the top of his voice every day, but it wasn't until seven days had passed that a neighbor, Diane Young, heard his screams. 'I was so glad that I actually heard him,' said Ms Young. She called 911 in order for him to be taken to hospital, severely dehydrated. Weeks since the incident, he has almost full recovered with feeling on his left side. Doctors say he should make a full recovery. Mr Adsley says that the entire episode has forced him to re-examine how he lives his life and particular lifestyle choices such as weight and smoking . Realizing his best chances of being heard were in the early mornings and evenings when his neighbors were leaving for or returning from work and were outside in the parking lot, Adsley said he waited for those windows of opportunity . 'The worst part was being unable to move because you can't move,' he said.  'People say, go get your phone, call an ambulance. My phone's laying on my kitchen table 20 feet away — I can't get to it!' His daughter has spoken of her guilt at not discovering her father sooner or deciding to send someone to check on him . It was only after she had not heard from her father for the entire week that she decided to send a local friend around to check on him. When there was no answer at his door, she decided to call the local hospital. Her father had been taken there just hours earlier. 'I felt very guilty, not calling him or being there, because I'd been thinking about going up to visit him earlier,' said  Adsley choking back tears. As a result of the incident, Mr Adsley has decided to move closer to Vancouver so he can be closer to his family. 'I’ve since learned that what I had was a blood clot in my head. That’s what caused my stroke,' he said, adding he had all the risk factors for a stroke: high blood pressure, a two-pack-a-day smoking habit and he was overweight. He says he learned a lot about himself during the week-long ordeal. 'You’re a lot tougher than you think,' he said. “Hang in there. You can survive almost anything if you put your mind to it.'","Steve Adsley, 62, collapsed whilst in the bathroom and ended up paralyzed .

"Show mercy: Amanda Innes sent a message to Malaysian authorities begging: 'Please don't hang my daughter - I know she's innocent' A mother has pleaded with Malaysia not to send her daughter – herself a mother of six - to the gallows after she was allegedly found in a car with more than 2lbs of the drug ice under a seat. Amanda Innes sent a message to Malaysian authorities begging: ‘Please don’t hang my daughter – I know she’s innocent.’ Emma Louise L’Aiguille, 34, who has given birth to eight children, two of which died in infancy, was driving a car with a Nigerian man sitting in the passenger seat when the vehicle was stopped and searched by police. Officials claim they found ice under the passenger seat – and Miss L’Aiguille was charged with possession, a crime that would mean a mandatory death sentence if she is convicted. In a passionate plea to Malaysia, Miss Aiguille’s mother, who lives near Melbourne, said: ‘Please don’t hang her. I just want the Government to do all they can. ‘I just want her to be brought home alive.’ She told Melbourne’s Herald-Sun newspaper that her daughter, a nurse’s aide, was on a tourist visa in Malaysia, where she was visiting her boyfriend. ‘I understand it’s hanging over there and I would ask the government to spare her that and give her life in prison if she is convicted,’ Mrs Innes told Fairfax radio. ‘No parent would hope that their child was doing drugs or anything like that.’ On trial: Emma Louise L'Aiguille, 34, who has six children, was driving a car with a Nigerian man sitting in the passenger seat when the vehicle was stopped and searched by police . Tough stance: Miss Aiguille was stopped by police as she drove through Kuala Lumpur (pictured). Her passenger was arrested with her, but a second man fled the scene . She said the Australian consulate was getting medical help for her daughter to help her with ‘depression or something.’ She added: ‘If she had been on drugs then she’d be coming off them, so she’d need medical help to come off it.’ ‘Ice’, also known as ‘crystal’ or ‘crystal meth’ due to its crystalline appearance,  is a highly purifiedbform of the drug methamphetamine. It is a man-made drug, often manufactured in illegal laboratories using a range of pharmaceutical drugs mixed with other toxic chemicals. It increases arousal in nervous system: pumps up levels of norepinephrine and dopamine. Anxiety, emotional swings, and paranoia are common psychological effects of chronic use. Overdose is a huge risk: Symptoms include fever, convulsions, and coma. Highs . tend to last 4-12 hours with users continuing to take the drug for . days - sometimes addicts stay awake for days, eat very little and in . heightened state of arousal. But she said she did not believe her daughter had a history of drug use. Miss Aiguille was stopped by police as . she drove through Kuala Lumpur. Her passenger was arrested with her, . but a second man fled the scene. Malaysia shows no mercy to drug traffickers or people in possession of more than 15grams of prohibited drugs. A . Briton, 28-year-old Kevin Barlow, who also held Australian citizenship, . and his Australian companion, Brian Chambers, were hanged side by side . in Kuala Lumpur in 1986 for trying to leave Malaysia with heroin packed . in a suitcase. Three years later Briton Derrick Gregory, 39, was hanged in Kuala Lumpur after being found with more than a pound of heroin. ‘Ice’, also known as ‘crystal’ or ‘crystal meth’ due to its crystalline appearance,  is a term used to describe a form of the drug methamphetamine. It is a highly purified form of methamphetamine and the most potent. This is the main reason why the drug is considered dangerous and can be powerfully addictive. It is a man-made drug, often manufactured in illegal laboratories using a range of pharmaceutical drugs. They are then mixed with other toxic, corrosive and flammable chemicals such as red . phosphorus, hydrochloric acid, methylated spirits and acetone.","Amanda Innes wants help from the Australian government to bring daughter Emma Louise L’Aiguille home .

"At least 22 immigrants have drowned after two dangerously overfilled boats sank off of the coast of a Greek island last night. Four children and 18 adults were found either dead in the water or crammed into the cabin of a yacht, which overturned along with a dinghy off the coast of Samos. More than 30 survivors were also pulled from the Aegean sea by the Greek coastguard. Though the nationalities of the dead are unclear, the survivors included Somalis, Syrians and Eritreans. Scroll down for video . Capsized: The yacht, pictured in the Aegean sea, overturned last night, killing eighteen people . Disaster: The Greek coastguard dragged the yacht back to shore and righted it, after bodies of children were found in the cabin . Smugglers: Samos, a Greek island off the Turkish coast, is a hotspot for migrants and traffickers trying to enter the EU . The authorities, who dragged the overturned yacht back to shore today, could not immediately say why it had capsized. Officials . said 36 people - 32 men, three women and a child - were rescued, and the . child was airlifted to a hospital on the mainland in critical . condition. Survivors included 23 Somalis, nine Syrians and three . Eritreans, the coast guard said. The child's nationality and the . nationalities of those who died are unclear. Coast . guard officials recovered the bodies of two women, a man and a boy from . the sea, and later found a further 18 bodies - including three children . - inside the yacht after it was towed to Samos. Survivors . told the coast guard between 60 and 65 people had been on the 10-meter . (30-foot) yacht and the two-meter (six-foot) dinghy that had set off . from Turkey. 'We can't give a precise number of missing people with any certainty,' a coast guard spokesman said. Coast . guard vessels, fishing boats and two search and rescue helicopters were . combing the area for survivors or bodies. A nearby cruise ship helped . for several hours in the morning before being cleared to continue its . journey. Rescue efforts: 36 survivors were found in the Aegean Sea as well as the 22 who died . Escape: The passengers, thought to have been trying to enter the EU, including Somalis, Eritreans and Syrians . In recent years Samos has become a hotspot for smugglers and people traffickers because it is close to the Turkish coast. Rescue teams led a search for up to seven more people missing, in what was one of the deadliest migrant boat accidents in Greek waters in recent years and the third fatal one this year. The vessels overturned before dawn off the island of Samos, a favorite destination for migrant-smuggling gangs because it's close to the Turkish coast. The Greek coast guard said it was not immediately clear what caused the overloaded craft to capsize. Greece's merchant marine minister, Miltiadis Varvitsiotis, said he was 'devastated' by the incident, adding that the government would press other European Union members to draw up a joint plan to fight migrant smugglers more effectively. 'Modern-day slave traders are making a fortune by place placing thousands of people's lives at risk, putting them on small and unsuitable boats at night in the Aegean,' he said. Fatal accidents are frequent as migrants risk the dangerous sea crossing from Turkey. Removed: The yacht was taken away by crane at the port of Malagrari on Samos . Loss: A Greek minister said that he was 'devastated' to hear of the loss of life in the accident . 'It is vital to understand what it is that routinely brings thousands of migrants to trust smugglers, face exorbitant costs, and risk their lives on unseaworthy vessels,' said migration expert Maurizio Albahari, an assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Notre Dame. 'It's quite simple. It is legally impossible for them to travel safely on planes and ferries. But they risk... many dangers to escape despair, and are prepared to die in order to set off with new hope,' he said, adding that policymakers could consider off-shore asylum applications and a transnational coast guard effort to help prevent such deaths. Officials said 36 people - 32 men, three women and a child - were rescued, and the child was airlifted to a hospital on the mainland in critical condition. Survivors included 23 Somalis, nine Syrians and three Eritreans, the coast guard said. The child's nationality and the nationalities of those who died are unclear. Dangerous: A migration experts explained how many in war-torn Africa are 'prepared to die' in the hope of reaching Europe . Coast guard officials recovered the bodies of two women, a man and a boy from the sea, and later found a further 18 bodies - including three children - inside the yacht after it was towed to Samos. Survivors told the coast guard between 60 and 65 people had been on the 10-meter (30-foot) yacht and the two-meter (six-foot) dinghy that had set off from Turkey.

Coast guard vessels, fishing boats and two search and rescue helicopters were combing the area for survivors or bodies. A nearby cruise ship helped for several hours in the morning before being cleared to continue its journey. Before Monday, 21 people had drowned in similar incidents since the beginning of the year. At least 21 people died, and six are still missing, after a similar accident in December 2012. Over the weekend, the Greek coast guard rescued about 250 immigrants from the sea.","Four children and 18 adults found dead in the water by Greek coastguard .

The family of notorious gangster 'Mad' Frankie Fraser are to sue a hospital for failing to spot his leg was fractured before he died. Relatives claim Fraser would have been in 'immense pain' after suffering the fracture and believe if if the injury had been spotted earlier he could still be alive. Fraser, who allegedly pulled out his victims' teeth with pliers, died at King's College Hospital in London last week after he had to be put in a coma after attempts to operate the fracture. His family are now suing the hospital, the Sunday People reported. Fraser's son and carer Patrick said: 'They sent him home after ten days of X-rays and bone scans before contacting me to tell me he had a fracture. 'Even then we had to wait for a proper appointment. 'The pain he must have been in would have been immense.' He said the family was keen to take action to ensure a similar incident did not happen to other patients. The fracture is believed to be related to an injury Fraser suffered when he helped lead riots at Pankhurst Prison in 1969. Fraser, who was 90 when he died, spent 42 years of his life in prison. He was a key member of feared London gangs in the 1960s, taking part in turf wars in the city and being associated with gangsters the Kray twins. The pair were once his biggest rivals. Fraser was part of the violent Richardson gang, which was well known in London. He was implicated in the Richardson's 'torture trial' where the gang dished out punishments of electric shocks, whipping and burning to disloyal gang members. Before this he worked as a bodyguard when it is claimed he attacked his victims with razor blades for £50 a time. His life after prison also continued to be colourful as he earned further fame by appearing in several crime dramas in the 1990s. The notorious gangster was also invited to play several cameo roles in gangland dramas. He also launched a one-man show — An Evening With Mad Frankie Fraser — that toured the country, a highlight of which was when he told his audience how he preferred the cat o’nine tails to the birch because it was ‘more manly’. Fraser became known as 'The Dentist' as he allegedly pulled out the teeth of his rivals with pliers and is pictured in his own one man show in London in 1995 (left(, and after he was arrested in the 1960s (right) Fraser's family is suing King's College Hospital in London for failing to spot the fracture before he died . Fraser also managed to get an Asbo in 2011 following a row with a fellow resident at his sheltered housing in Bermondsey, south east London, over his favourite chair. However it is claims that he used pliers to pull out the teeth of his rivals that earned him such notoriety and the nickname The Dentist. Fraser had an operation last Saturday and was put into a medically induced coma on Wednesday.He had suffered with Alzheimer's for the last three years. A spokesman for King's College Hospital said they were 'aware of the complaint' and that an investigation was currently underway.","Frankie Fraser died at King's College Hospital following a hip operation .

"It is a brutal example nature in action - a hungry lioness charges into a pack of crocodiles, swiping with its claws as the huge reptiles snap back in anger. Despite being completely outnumbered, the ravenous predator still takes on the crocodile gang in an attempt to force them back from the overturned body of a nearby hippo. These stunning images, taken in a Kenyan nature reserve, show the moment the animals clash in an attempt to win a meal from the carcass. Clash: The hungry lioness aims a swipe at one of three crocodile stalking the waters . Scrap: The confrontation took place in the Masi Mara nature reserve in Kenya . The lioness, who hunted with another lion, was seen earlier in the day stalking the corpse on the other side of the river. The hippo had died the night before, but lay unclaimed on the river bank in the Masi Mara reserve for hours. But by the time the lioness and her companion, who was not pictured, made it to the body, it had been claimed by the pack of crocodiles. IT manager and part-time photographer Richard Chew captured the encounter while holidaying in Africa with his wife. Outnumbered: The lioness was photographed facing down at least six crocodiles . Nose to nose: The animals were fighting over the carcass of a hippo which died the previous day . Mr Chew, from San Francisco, said: 'Two lions spotted the hippo at first but couldn't reach it as they were on the wrong side of the river. 'They were really showing no fear. The river was full of crocodiles who were wanting a piece of the hippo but the lions were putting up a good fight. 'It was amazing to watch the wildlife food chain in action.'

"It is one of the most prestigious public schools in Britain, with the distinctive black blazers of its pupils a familiar sight in the West London borough of Hammersmith. But because of a worrying wave of street robberies in the area, the boys from St Paul’s School have been banned from displaying their uniform outside the school gates – and parents at the £22,000-a-year establishment have been urged to buy hooded tops for their sons so they blend in more easily with the local youths. It is understood that criminal gangs have been targeting the pupils in the belief that they are likely to be carrying expensive smartphones. The mother of one young robbery victim said: ‘If anything, they could get into trouble with teachers for keeping their uniform on these days. The mugging problem has become very bad lately. There have been at least 14 that I know of.’ Students at St Paul's School are being targeted by criminals as they believe the pupils will be carrying expensive smartphones . St Paul's School (pictured) is a £22,000-a-year establishment near Hammersmith, London . The concerned parent said teachers now patrolled Hammersmith Bridge because most pupils have to walk across it every day and the muggers wait at either end knowing they have no escape. ‘They know these children have the best iPhones or the best laptops and iPads,’ she added. The boys-only day school on the banks of the Thames has one of the toughest admissions tests in London and most pupils come from its £6,000-a-year preparatory school Colet Court. Former St Paul’s pupils include the poet John Milton, diarist Samuel Pepys and Chancellor George Osborne. The rules state that boys are required to wear charcoal grey trousers with a plain white shirt and a school tie corresponding with their house for most of the time, adding the famous black blazer for formal events. Chancellor George Osborne (pictured) is a former student at the school . Now they have been told to cover up the ties and are also allowed to exchange their black leather shoes for trainers to walk home in. And although many former students wear their St Paul’s School scarves with pride, current pupils are told they could be putting themselves in danger by following suit in public. It seems the recent spate of robberies might not be an entirely new phenomenon. Former pupil Douglas Edwardes-Ker, now 30, told The Mail on Sunday last night: ‘There were some muggings in my day. The bigger kids like me would look out for the smaller ones and try to save the day if something went wrong. ‘The local kids from the estates nearby hated us. They saw us as privileged and spoiled and I suppose they thought we were an easy target because they assumed we wouldn’t fight back. ‘They didn’t account for some of the rugby players.’ A school source said the no-uniform policy had been in place for six months, and in that time, the number of muggings had fallen significantly. The source added: ‘All pupils are now told never to leave the premises wearing their blazers. We encourage them to wear overcoats or hoodies once they leave the grounds in order to keep themselves safe.’","Boys at St Paul's have been banned from wearing blazer outside gates .

"President Obama’s high school pot dealer who he thanked in his yearbook for the 'good times' was beaten to death by his lover after a series of fights over flatulence and drugs, MailOnline can reveal today. Raymond Boyer, known as 'Gay Ray' to Obama and his marijuana smoking 'Choom Gang', was bludgeoned to death with a hammer seven years after he sold the future president and his friends drugs. His lover Andrew Devere, a male prostitute, gave police a laundry list of reasons for the killing, including that Boyer, a surfer and unemployed chef, constantly put him down, made him beg for drugs and had a habit of breaking wind in his face. Good times: Obama thanked Ray in his high school yearbook alongside his family and his Choom Gang buddies . Pot head: Obama and his 'Choom Gang' of privately-educated friends used to score drugs off Ray. Ray was murdered seven years after the gang left school by his lover for a myriad of bizarre and frankly petty reasons . The sordid end to the life of Boyer at 37 was in direct contrast to the young men he supplied drugs to who all went on to lead successful and productive lives. Since getting high with Obama and his private school educated friends he lost his job as the manager of a local pizzeria and ended up on welfare living above a car repair shop. The full extent of Ray's grisly end and the bizarre reasons for it were set out in mitigation by Devere, who was jailed for life for the murder. Appeal court documents from 1991, uncovered for the first time by MailOnline, reveal Devere killed Boyer on New Year’s Day 1986 because: Boyer was killing a friend of his by supplying that friend with drugs; Boyer embarrassed Devere and put him down in front of other people; Boyer had developed a habit of farting in Devere's face; Boyer once attacked Devere with a knife, slicing Devere's finger; Boyer made Devere beg for drugs. Finally, the documents say the last straw came on the morning that Devere killed Boyer when the victim had refused to give Devere money to buy medication to soothe the murderer's sore throat. Obama has never hidden his drug taking youth and recently put on record that he felt that marijuana was no worse than alcohol. Killer: Andrew Devere, pictured in a variety of mugshots over the years, was sentenced to life for the grisly crime. He said he killed Boyer because he broke wind in his face, was killing a friend by selling him drugs, didn't pick up his medicine for a sore throat and insulted him in public. Devere is now free and living on the mainland . Party bus: Obama and the Choom Gang used to go to parties in the hills in Ray's surf van (file photo) and get high. Weed was rife in Hawaii during the counter-culture years of the 1970s and often smoked openly . He mentioned in his own autobiography that he took drugs. And David Maraniss’s book ‘Barack Obama: The Story’ revealed the existence of the Choom Gang (Choom is slang for smoking pot) and their dealer 'Ray'. It was even known that 'Ray' had been murdered but only now can the MailOnline can reveal the full tragic story of his life. Raymond Boyer, originally from California, was an athletic surfer who earned a living as the day manager of a pizza restaurant near the private school where Obama and his teenage friends were taught in Hawaii. Mama Mia Pizza restaurant, which also had a bar, was at the centre of a thriving university scene in Honolulu during the counter culture days of 1979. At the time, marijuana – or pakalolo as it was known locally - was flourishing on the island. It was grown in the hills and sold and smoked openly on the streets and beaches. Boyer, 30 at the time, lived the . archetypal hippy existence, sleeping in an old bus with two pet monkeys, . and enjoying in full the promiscuous and hedonistic lifestyle of the . gay community on the Pacific island. He . also dealt drugs to friends  - and it was through supplying marijuana . that he came into contact with the young Obama, known as Barry, who was . attending Punahou school nearby. Obama, . 18, who was only just beginning to explore his black roots – having . been brought up by his white grandparents – was a leading member of a . group called the Choom Gang. Choom . is island slang for pot smoking and the group went on excursions to the . countryside where they would get high and party, sometimes in Ray’s . surf van. Experiments: Obama, . 18, who was only just beginning to explore his black roots – having . been brought up by his white grandparents – was a leading member of a . group called the Choom Gang . Choom: The gang, whose other passions were beer and basketball, even made up rules about the smoking of 'bud'. Obama was particularly fond of the 'interception' and 'roof hits', according to a biography . The gang, whose other passions were beer and basketball, even made up rules about the smoking of 'bud'. One of them was that you skipped a turn if you did not inhale properly and the other, a favorite of Obama, was that you could grab an extra drag of a joint if you elbowed in and shouted 'intercepted'. The young Obama popularized the concept of 'roof hits', when all the windows of a car were rolled up so you could suck up the last bit of smoke from the ceiling. 'Wasting good bud smoke was not tolerated,' Tom Topolinski, one member of the Choom Gang, told Maraniss. 'Barry also had a knack for interceptions. When a joint was making the rounds, he often elbowed his way in, out of turn, shouted ""Intercepted!"", and took an extra hit. No one seemed to mind.' Ray, although older, was an integral part of the gang, known for his ability to 'score good bud' and drive them up nearby Mount Tantalus to party. He even got a mention in Obama's . school yearbook as the teenager wrote his thanks to: 'Tut [his . grandmother], Gramps, Choom Gang, and Ray for all the good times.' While the other members of the gang went onto university and careers as . lawyers, writers and businessmen, Ray’s wild life was just beginning to . unravel. He lost his job at Mama Mia’s and lived above a car repair shop in a rundown area of downtown Honolulu. His . relationships became ever more sordid and he ended up sleeping with a . gay prostitute drug addict called Andrew Devere, 17 years his junior. This was to be his undoing. As . he slept on New Year’s Day 1986, Devere, upset with Ray’s treatment of . him, took a claw hammer and literally beat his brains out. His body was . not found until eight days later. Devere . said that he had meant to shoot Boyer but could not get a gun and was . planning to kill him at night but he fell asleep. He finally bludgeoned . him to death the next morning. Formative: It emerged last week that Obama believes that marijuana is no more dangerous than booze . Privileged: Devere's current wife Elizabeth suggested that rich people have 'the right tools' to deal with taking drugs, but those like Devere, a former male prostitute, didn't and they 'subtract from the good' He said: 'I wasn't mad at him at the time that I did it.... But I knew I had to do it because.... later on ... I knew that I would, you know, I would forget about how he treated me'. Devere, who jailed for life for the murder but released in 2007, has since moved to the mainland. He now has a wife and although has since been convicted of minor drug offenses holds down a job. He is too traumatized to talk about his old life but his wife, Elizabeth, told MailOnline that the gruesome episode was a warning to anyone. 'He is embarrassed about it but I told him that you cannot run from it,' she said. 'Drugs always alter your mind. I have a past myself. Because of the drugs and his lifestyle it was a really tough environment to survive in. 'He survived by being a prostitute. I think drugs affect people in different ways. It depends how you are brought up. 'If you have the right tools to deal with them then it’s okay. But if not they definitely subtract from the good.'","Raymond Boyer was known as 'Gay Ray' to .

"Nearly seven in ten people believe the military campaign in Afghanistan has not been ‘worthwhile’ for Britain. As the last British troops left Camp Bastion yesterday, a poll suggested the majority of the public are sceptical of the claims of politicians and generals that the 13-year conflict has made both Afghanistan and the UK safer from terrorism. The research, for BBC news, found 68 per cent thought it had not been worthwhile and 42 per cent believed the UK was actually ‘less safe’ now than when the war began in 2001. Scroll down for video . Farewell: Wing Commander Matt Radnall hugs Brigadier Robert Thomson, carrying his carefully folded Union Flag as the very last British Chinook helicopter arrives at Kandahar from Camp Bastion . Only 14 per cent of the 1,000 people polled thought the UK was safer as a result of the intervention, and 39 per cent thought there was ‘no real difference’ as Britain’s military involvement formally came to a close this week and Camp Bastion was handed over to Afghan control. Less than a third were confident that Afghanistan could continue to ‘protect its citizens without the help of UK forces’ following years of training and investment in the Afghan national police and Army, while 64 per cent said they were not confident they were up to the challenge. Labour shadow justice minister Dan Jarvis, a former officer in the Parachute regiment who has served in Afghanistan, yesterday called for a formal review of Britain’s role in Afghanistan, after the election, to look at whether the political and military objectives had been achieved, and examine the war on drugs. Time to go home: Some of the last British troops head towards the flight line as they prepare to leave Camp Bastion after  handing it over to Afghan National Army . Coming home: Troops from 7 Force Protection Wing, Royal Air Force Regiment 15 and 34 Squadron, stand in their 'stick' waiting for the very last flight out of Camp Bastion . He said the review would not seek to ‘apportion blame or scrutinise individual decisions, but to constructively draw conclusions about what can be learned from this deployment, to inform future foreign policy’. ‘Given the effort, the sacrifice and resource we’ve dedicated to this long campaign, I think that would be the right thing to do now,’ he added. The commander of the Afghan army, Major General Sayed Malook, said: ‘I would really like to pay my condolences to the families and even to the governments, those who sent the soldiers to bring peace and prosperity to the Afghan people. Fears: As the  troops left Camp Bastion, a poll suggested the majority of the public are sceptical of the claims of politicians and generals that the 13-year conflict has made both Afghanistan and the UK safer from terrorism . ‘I wish them all the best, especially all those mothers who sent their sons right here to secure this nation and to provide safety and security for the Afghan people.’ Meanwhile, David Cameron paid tribute to the ‘incredible’ service personnel who have completed their mission in Afghanistan. He said: ‘Yesterday, British forces concluded their combat mission in Afghanistan. I know the thoughts of the whole House will be with the friends and families of every one of the 453 British soldiers who lost their lives in this long campaign. Study: Research, for BBC news, found 68 per cent thought the conflict had not been worthwhile and 42 per cent believed the UK was actually 'less safe' now than when the war began in 2001 . Probe: Labour shadow justice minister Dan Jarvis, a former officer in the Parachute regiment who has served in Afghanistan, has called for a formal review of Britain’s role in Afghanistan, after the election . Thank you: Prime Minister David Cameron has paid tribute to the 'incredible' service personnel who have completed their mission in Afghanistan . ‘We will never forget their sacrifice for us.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband added: ‘All of our thanks are with those who have served our country and all of our thoughts are with the families of those who lost their lives. ‘But every one of our troops who served in Afghanistan can take pride in both their mission and what they achieved.’ The lives of the young Britons killed fighting the Taliban had been commemorated on memorial walls in Camp Bastion, but as the UK’s campaign in the country ended yesterday, it was confirmed they had been dismantled. They will be part of a new memorial at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire. Tory MP Colonel Bob Stewart said it had been a ‘sensible decision’ because the memorial could have been desecrated. Speaking from Camp Bastion yesterday, Brigadier Rob Thomson, the UK’s most senior officer in Helmand, said: ‘We are going home and so we are taking it home.’ A memorial to murdered soldier Lee Rigby near the spot where he was hacked to death by jihadists will not include his name, it has emerged. Campaigners have accused councillors of bowing to threats from extremists. More than 100,000 people had called for the tribute to the 25-year-old, who was murdered outside Woolwich Barracks, South London, in May 2013. But the stone memorial in St George’s Chapel Gardens opposite the barracks, will not refer to him directly, but commemorate ‘all service men and women who have served or lived in Woolwich and who have given their lives in the service of their country’. Lyn Rigby, the fusilier’s mother said: ‘I support the council’s plans and will feel able to visit the memorial in the Chapel.’","Poll suggests public are sceptical of claims conflict has made the UK safer .

"Margaret Thatcher foresaw her downfall at the hands of the 'men in grey suits' as early as 1983, newly-released files reveal. Despite having won the most decisive election victory since Labour's landslide in 1945, the Prime Minister correctly predicted that her party would eventually turn against her. But she was premature and believed the Conservatives would not allow her to take them into the 1987 election, which she also won. Scroll down for video . Newly-released files show how Margaret Thatcher foresaw her downfall as Prime Minister as early as 1983 . Instead, the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century was forced out and replaced by John Major in 1990 after her colleagues turned on her. Her trusted private secretary, John Coles, composed a private memoir of his time at Number 10 which is published today by the Margaret Thatcher Archive Trust. In one entry, he writes: 'I recall my surprise when she said to me, just two or three days after the Conservative victory of June 1983: 'I have not long to go.' 'For someone who had just won a majority of 140 seats this was a remarkable statement. When I queried it, she said: 'My party won't want me to lead them into the next election - and I don't blame them.' 'A graphic example of her detachment from conventional political wisdom and her sense of future political developments.' She was forced to stand down as prime minister after her Cabinet refused to back her in a second round of leadership elections. Thatcher was replaced by John Major (pictured with wife Norma) in 1990 after her colleagues turned on her . She said at the time that pressure from colleagues had forced her to conclude that party unity and the prospect of victory in the next general election would be better served if she stepped down. She later described her departure from Downing Street at the hands of the 'grey men' as `treachery with a smile on its face'. The Prime Minister had confidently celebrated the tenth anniversary of her premiership in May 1989 having earlier vowed to go 'on and on.' But that autumn, she faced the first challenge to her leadership from back-bench MP Sir Anthony Meyer acting as a stalking horse. He won 33 votes, while another 24 MPs spoilt their ballot papers. She was the longest serving British prime minister of the 20th century but Margaret Thatcher feared her career may be over as early as 1983. Her private secretary, John Coles, composed a private memoir covering his time at Number 10 between December 1981 and June 1984. He has now allowed this to be published by the Margaret Thatcher Archive Trust. In one entry, he writes: 'I recall my surprise when she said to me, just two or three days after the Conservative victory of June 1983, 'I have not long to go'. 'For someone who had just won a majority of 140 seats this was a remarkable statement. 'When I queried it, she said 'My party won't want me to lead them into the next election - and I don't blame them'. 'A graphic example of her detachment from conventional political wisdom and her sense of future political developments.' Mrs Thatcher served as prime minister from 1979 to 1990. The following year, with anger over the poll tax leading to riots and her party split over her refusal to allow the pound to be dragged into the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, her premiership was rocked when her Deputy Prime Minister Sir Geoffrey Howe quit and gave an electrifying resignation speech to the Commons. It prompted her long term rival, Michael Heseltine, to stand against her in the first genuine test of her leadership. She secured 204 votes in the first ballot on November 20, compared with 152 for Mr Heseltine. But 16 abstentions meant it was four votes short of the necessary 15 per cent victory margin, and so a second ballet was required. Mrs Thatcher, who had been so confident of winning that she was in France for a summit meeting, emerged from the British Embassy in Paris almost immediately to confirm that she'd contest a second ballot, insisting: `I fight on. I fight to win.' But as she returned to London it was clear that Tory MPs were deserting the Prime Minister. As she met her Cabinet one by one that evening, she suffered what she later called `treachery with a smile on its face'. They persuaded her that she would almost certainly lose to Mr Heseltine if she fought on. She quit, allowing Douglas Hurd and John Major to join the contest. Mr Major was two votes short of the necessary 187 needed for an outright majority, but his opponents withdrew. The following day, November 28, 1990, Mrs Thatcher left Downing Street for the last time as Prime Minister. Standing with her husband Denis, she declared: 'we're happy to leave the UK in a very much better state than when we came here'. The Iron Lady then wept as she was driven to Buckingham Palace to formally tender her resignation to the Queen.","Newly-released files show how Thatcher foresaw downfall as early as 1983 .

"For more than two years Margot Woelk had to taste Hitler's food to ensure it was not poisoned. She feasted on fresh fruit and vegetables including asparagus, peppers and peas, while her fellow Germans were being rationed. Mrs Woelk, now 95, was one of a dozen women the Fuhrer used to protect himself at his Eastern front HQ known as the Wolf's Lair. Scroll down for video . Eating: Hitler with his mistress Eva Braun. Every meal the dictator had was  tasted to make sure he was not poisoned . She was taken there in 1942 when she was evacuated  from Berlin to the East Prussian village of Gross Partsch - Parcz in modern-day Poland - after her flat was bombed. Her husband had gone off to the fighting and her mother-in-law offered her a house in the countryside. But the SS picked her up soon after she arrived and took her to meet the unwilling tasters. Mrs Woelk told the Times: ''Of course I was afraid. If it [the food] had been poisoned I would not be here today. We were forced to eat it, we had no choice. 'Between 11 and 12 o'clock, we had to . taste the food, and only after all 15 of us had tried it was it was . driven to the headquarters by the SS. 'Hitler was so paranoid that the British would poison him - that's why he had 15 girls taste the food before he ate it himself,' said Margot.

There was always an hour's delay before Hitler tucked into his meal so that any effects of the food on the women could be seen. Mrs Woelk had to report every day, but was only used when Hitler's personal train was in the station. She lived with her mother-in-law outside the HQ until the unsuccessful assassination attempt on Hitler's life by Claus von Stauffenberg with a briefcase bomb in July 1944.

From that moment she was confined to a school building and could only see her mother-in-law at weekends watched by the SS. When Hitler abandoned the lair after 800 days in November 1944, a senior officer helped her escape back to Berlin by smuggling her on board Joseph Goebbels' train. She believes the other tasters were shot by the advancing Russians. In 1946 she was reunited with her husband who she had presumed dead. The couple lived together until he died in 1990.","She was one of a dozen women who ate his food watched by SS guards .

"Vanessa-Mae was banned from international skiing for four years yesterday after taking part in fixed races to help her qualify for the Winter Olympics. The 36-year-old British violinist competed for Thailand, the country of her father’s birth, at the Games in Sochi last February. She skied under the name Vanessa Vanakorn and said it had been an ‘amazing’ experience despite coming last out of 67 competitors. Scroll down for video . Banned: Violinist Vanessa-Mae, pictured on Monday ahead of a concert in Prague, took part in fixed races in Slovenia in order to qualify for the Sochi Winter Olympic, organised at the request of her manager . But yesterday the Swiss-based International Ski Federation (FIS) said it had found ‘violations’ in her results from a hastily staged event in Slovenia held days before the deadline for Olympic qualification. It said that without the cheating she would not have achieved the points needed to be eligible to ski in the Games. Officials are said to have invented times for skiers who did not race and faked times for skiers who did not finish. They also broke rules by not changing the course design between the first and second runs, and allowing skiers to continue in poor weather which required abandonment. Five officials involved in the event at Krvavec in Slovenia have been banned by FIS. It is unclear if Thai Olympic officials were involved or if they will face IOC sanctions. The FIS said: ‘The competitions were organised at the request of the management of Vanessa Vanakorn, through the Thai Olympic Committee.’ FIS president Gian Franco Kasper said: ‘Those who have been sanctioned have been sanctioned for good reason.’ Cheater, cheater: Vanessa-Mae, who competed for Thailand as Vanessa Vanakorn, finished last of 67 racers in the two-run giant slalom in Sochi, almost a minute slower than the winner . Fake it til you make it: The International Ski Federation ruled that Vanessa-Mae would not have been able to qualify for the Olympic Games without the cheating . The International Olympic Committee declined to comment on details of the case until possible appeals are completed. Last night Vanessa-Mae was unavailable for comment. But if she does harbour dreams of another Olympic appearance, she may be disappointed. It is thought the ban would prevent her from competing at the next Winter Olympics in South Korea in 2018. The classical music star was born in Singapore to Thai and Chinese parents and moved to England at the age of four. Shortly after finishing the Games in February, she said: ‘With my limited experience – I only started training six months ago – I’m just glad I made it down.’","Vanessa-Mae skied in fixed races to qualify for the Sochi Olympics .

"Australia may be a country filled with amazing natural beauty, but when it comes to some of its man-made efforts, the words ‘could do better’ suddenly spring to mind. However, now that one of Brisbane’s biggest eyesores is about to disappear from the city’s skyline, with Roma Street’s Brisbane Transit Centre to be ­demolished to make way for the redesigned Bus and Train tunnel, why should we stop here? It's a progressive step and one that could help other cities take a similar initiative. Many other buildings around the country are in bad need of an update, or perhaps being replaced too. Scroll down for video . Brisbane Transit Centre is to be ­demolished and it won't be missed, Transport Minister Scott Emerson said . The Courier Mail reported that a new, modern transit centre will be built in place of the transit centre, following a fresh proposal for the BaT tunnel that would have it constructed below the site instead of beside Roma Street Parkland. Transport Minister Scott Emerson said the transit centre, often voted one of Brisbane’s ugliest buildings, would not be missed and we now had a chance to build an ‘iconic gateway’ to the city. In 2012 The Pixel building in Melbourne was named among the world’s top 10 building eyesores by travel website Trippy.com and Reuters. An architectural guinea pig in carbon neutral designs, the building stands out with its quirky design featuring what appear to be shards of glass in bright colours, news.com.au said. It’s not the only building in Melbourne deemed 'ugly' either, with Federation Square named among the world’s top 10 ugliest buildings by travel site Virtual Tourist in 2009. A review of the building found it: ‘Frenzied and overly complicated, the chaotic feel of the complex is made worse by a web of unsightly wires from which overhead lights dangle.’ Parliament House in Adelaide has been called  odd, awkward and inelegant by some architects. It's a building that would fit in perfectly into a gothic horror film. A Guardian city review of Perth said its urban sprawl is considered one of the worst in the world, due to the unfortunate tendency to build out rather than up, and the fact western Australians are loath to give up their three-car garages. The Pixel building in Melbourne was named among the world’s top 10 building eyesores in 2012 . Perth Convention and Exhibition Centre has its fair share of critics . The Telstra Exchange in Perth has not proved to be a very popular design with locals . ‘Many would call the Perth Arena the worst building in Perth,’ the review states. ‘I guess I get it – it’s misshapen and angular. It resembles a teenager who hasn’t grown into his body and is all elbows and knees.’ In a poll taken by PerthNow readers the search for our city's most unsightly building was a close race but three stood out in the minds of. After more than 10,000 votes were cast, the Perth Arena finished just ahead of the Perth Convention and Entertainment Centre and the Telstra Exchange. Perth Arena grabbed more than 28 per cent of the vote, while the PCEC (24.8 per cent) had edged ahead of the Telstra Exchange (23.1 per cent). The Telstra Building at the Gabba in Brisbane has had its fair share of criticism . Stockland House in Sydney is the head office of Stockland, one of Australia's largest property groups . Sydney’s Meriton Tower has balconies that critics say don't work aesthetically . Meanwhile the Telstra Building at the Gabba in Brisbane was described by one architecture blogger as ‘a disgrace and the planner who allowed it to go there should be charged for crimes against humanity.’ In listing Sydney’s worst buildings, the Sydney Morning Herald plumped for Stockland House on Pitt Street. It’s the head office of Stockland, one of Australia's largest property groups. Faults include its pink marble facade, the car park entrance that destroys the footpath, and two ‘nasty’ pedestrian bridges. Sydney’s Meriton Tower was also described as Harry Seidler's ‘worst’ building, with balconies that don't work and an awkward pedestrian entrance canopy on George Street. Even the Australia War Annex in Canberra has had its detractors in the past . The Herald report also reserved a special mention for The Star in Pyrmont. Describing it as rude and greedy 'wall' that blocks the harbour, trashes streetscapes and is unfriendly upon entry. In the Brutalist Buildings in Canberra blog the Australia War Annex in Canberra also came in for some criticism. While not to be outdone, the Edmund Barton Building in Canberra, has divided opinions. It is a building that is loved by some for its modernist architecture, but to others it is just a concrete eyesore. Its concrete 'silos', joined by horizontal columns studded with steel buttons, have polarised the Canberra community for decades.

"'She's a beautiful girl': Tributes from across the racing poured in as news of Simone Montgomerie's death spread . One of Australia's top female jockeys has been trampled to death in a horror fall that has sent shockwaves through the horse-racing world. Simone Montgomerie was thrown to the turf at more than 40mph during a build-up race to the iconic Darwin Cup at Fannie Bay racecourse, in the Northern Territory, today. She was 26. Stewards are investigating the cause of the tragedy, but early indications suggest the mother-of-one's saddle may have slipped, sending her under the hooves of the stampede, just 100m from the finish. Medics rushed onto the course to treat her but she died of her injuries soon after arriving at hospital. Ms Montgomerie, who was aboard Riahgrand in the sprint, was well-known on Australia's horse-racing scene . and was a popular member of its close-knit jockey fraternity. Other . jockeys were left in a state of visible distress when news of their . friend's death filtered through the course forcing organisers to cancel . the remaining races, including the Darwin Cup itself. Darwin . Turf Club chairman Brett Dixon said: 'As far as we are concerned, . Simone was our family and we are all devastated by this accident.' Jockey Kerrin McEvoy, who won the 2000 Melbourne Cup aboard Brew, told news.com.au: 'I'm shattered by the news. 'I . know Simone really well, we actually did pony club together. My . condolences go to the Montgomerie family. She's a beautiful girl, it's . just a tragedy.' Former Grand National winner and Channel 4 racing pundit Mick Fitzgerald tweeted: 'Thoughts go out to the family of Simone Montgomerie who died earlier today following a fall at Darwin cup meeting.' Horse racing is one of the few 'mixed' sports where men and women compete head to head. Nevertheless, professional female jockeys are comparatively few, so those who do make the top flight are held in particularly high regard. Ms Montgomerie started her riding career in South Australia before moving to Darwin in November 2009 after joining trainer Michael Hickmott's stable. Tragic: Simone Montgomerie was travelling at more than 40mph when she was thrown from her mount during a 200-metre build-up sprint to the prestigious Darwin Cup at Fannie Bay, in Western Australia (stock image) Condolences: Ms Montgomerie's death has sent shockwaves across the racing world. Former Grand National winner and Channel 4 pundit Mick Fitzgerald paid this tribute on Twitter . Last season, she finished fourth in the Northern Territory Jockeys Premiership after riding 27 winners, beating another woman, Felicia Bergstrand, by three. Just last week she said of that achievement: 'This was not something I ever thought about achieving, but when it comes it is a bonus.' Montgomerie is the daughter of Peter Montgomerie, who trained 2005 Melbourne Cup runner-up On A Jeune. National Jockeys' Asscociation general manager Des O'Keeffe told the Herald Sun: 'It is unbelievable that this has happened just two days after National Jockeys Celebration day around the country. 'I have had many jockeys ring me and they are absolutely shattered.' National . Jockeys Celebration day was held on Saturday by the National Jockeys . Trust which provides support for families of killed and injured jockeys. Before news of Ms Montgomerie's death had reached the course, Chief Steward Lindsay Lane said: 'Obviously there's been quite a serious fall and Simone Montgomerie has gone to hospital in a critical condition. Close-knit: The other jockeys were visibly devastated by the news of their friend's death and the day's programme was cancelled, including the Darwin Cup itself . 'The stewards are somewhat concerned given the close nature of the riding community here in Darwin about the effect that it may have on the other riders so we've spoken to the riders. 'Some of them are quite concerned and quite upset so we've taken the view that the number one priority is safety and wellbeing of the riding group and we've elected to abandon the meeting. 'I'm sure that the riders can ride at their best but whether they can ride safely with the fall on their mind, the stewards aren't totally convinced. 'The common sense thing to do is to call the meeting off. It's very unfortunate for the club.'","Simone Montgomerie fell from mount in build-up to Darwin Cup yesterday .

"Clutching her two-year-old child to her chest, Selemawl Gimay struggles not to cry as she speaks of the last time she saw her husband. He managed to get on board a lorry to England a year ago after undertaking the 5,000mile journey from Eritrea to Calais. But his 25-year-old wife remains alone in the dangerous camp with their daughter Hani, unsure as to when she will get the chance to cross the Channel to be reunited with him. She is one of many women travelling thousands of miles in the desperate quest to start a new in Britain. Scroll down for video . Selemawl Gimay, 24, has brought her two-year-old daughter to Calais from Eritrea to try to find her husband . Sixteen-year-old Nura Seleh cooks chicken on a fire in the filthy Jungle 2 camp. She wants to get to Britain to become a clothes stylist . The womans' refuge in Calais where mirgrant girls under threat of attack and rape take shelter. The secondhand toys collected outside show how migrant children try to live a normal life . Husbands and wives are separated and fathers are forced to leave their children behind with their mothers as they dice with death to board lorries to Britain. Those who remain in the unsanitary camps that have no running water and are reliant on food and water handouts from aids charity live a life of misery. Mrs Gimay told the Mail she was finding it hard to look after her baby in the camp but had no choice because she wants them to be together as a family. ‘I miss him so much,’ she said. ‘Life here is so awful and I cannot wait to see my husband again so we can start our life in England.’ It has already been a year since he made the crossing to Britain where he has now set up home in Birmingham and is in the process of applying for asylum. But his wife, although optimistic, admits she does not know when she will ever get the chance to jump on board a lorry and evade detection with her toddler in tow. Nat Snet Kfley, 17, has living in the rubbish-strewn migrant camp in Calais for three months . Hizbawit Haile, 24, travelled 5,000 miles to Calais from Eritrea two months ago and is trying to sneak aboard a lorry to England to join her aunt in London . Childrens' toys outside the womens' refuge in Calais show who how many young boys and girls are brought thousands of miles by their mothers to try to get into Britain . She is one of just the women who live in squalid, unhygienic camps dotted around the tiny port town of Calais which are overwhelmingly populated by men. While these women are happy to discuss their desperate plight, they will not show their faces in case it harms their applications for asylum when they reach Britain. Those fleeing wartorn countries or persecution in their home countries are supposed to declare asylum in the first safe country they reach, which is usually Italy. Instead, they are convinced that Britain is an ‘El Dorado’ that they must reach and so they wait until they reach England to claim asylum. Most of the camp’s inhabitants tend to be the youngest and fittest men whose families pay people smugglers to get them from Libya to Italy and then up to France. Once they make it to Britain, they claim asylum or begin working in the black market so that they can send money back to their parents and siblings. But a handful of women make the crossing with the men and are forced to live in horrifically unsanitary conditions in camps where fighting is a regular occurrence. Police are out in force to tackle the large amount of migrants attempting to cross the English channel. The migrants run from the area they are staying across the main motorway leading to the ferry port to jump onto the lorries queuing for the ferry . A policeman climbs into a lorry to remove a migrant who has been trapped in-between the cargo and the lorry in Calais . Mrs Gimay, from the Eritrean capital Asmara, is one of the very few women who has made it to Calais with her baby in a bid to join her husband. She has been living in the camp for three months and is already feeling the burden of having to look after her daughter on her own. She paid $3,000 to people smugglers to get her to the camp and hopes to be reunited with her husband if she makes it aboard a lorry. ‘My husband went to the UK last year. He managed to get on the back of a lorry and get to England and he now lives in Birmingham,’ she said. ‘I miss him so much as I haven’t seen him for a year and our daughter has grown so much. I came to this camp so that I could get on a lorry to England but it is so hard with my daughter. ‘I want to study in England and maybe one day become a hairstylist when my family is reunited. ‘The conditions in the camp are so bad. It is so hard for me to live like this – especially with the baby – but we hope that one day we can reach England and have a good life. Selemawl Gimay, who has brought her two-year-old daughter 5,000 miles from Eritrea to the camp in Calais, wants to take her on a lorry to England to join her husband. Without water or basic sanitation, desperate women stick together in the camps to protect themselves against the threat of assault and potential rape . ‘It’s very difficult for my daughter to grow up here.’ Mrs Gimay is not the only woman in the camp whose family has been torn apart in their desperate quest to reach the UK. Demayd Tedros, 16, has been separated from her new husband for six years after he legally moved to the UK. ‘I married my husband last year in Ethiopia but we haven’t been able to live together because he has lived in Southampton for the past six years,’ she said. ‘I miss him very much. I want to be with him so I can have a baby and study English.’ She said she had boarded lorries at least 50 times only to be caught by sniffer dogs as the vehicles are searched on their way through the port. Her family paid people smugglers $5,000 to get her from Eritrea to Ethiopia, then Sudan and up to Libya before undertaking the boat journey to Italy and then getting the train to Calais. Migrants queue at daily food distribution centre close to the city hall in Calais, northern France . Queuing for food outside the camp in Calais. The vast majority of the migrants are men but increasing numbers of women are arriving to follow the husbands who have already arrived in Britain . Her friend Hizbawit Haile, 24, from Asmara, Eritrea, said she had been at the camp for two months and was desperate to board a lorry to get to Britain. ‘Life here is not good. I just want to go to England,’ she said. ‘It is very cold and it is difficult to get food and water. ‘My auntie lives in London and I will go to live with her when I get across. I miss my mother and father so much – they still live in Eritrea – but I will send money to them from England.’ Another girl in the camp, Nura Saleh, 16, said life was hard in the Jungle 2 camp, which is mostly populated by Eritreans, as she cooked chicken on a rudimentary fire. ‘I want to go to England to study and become a clothes stylist,’ she said. ‘It is getting colder and life is difficult in this place. I hope to get on a lorry soon.’ It is a familiar refrain from a group of people so desperate to reach Britain, that they will endure horrific and unsanitary conditions for as long as it takes. Another girl in the same camp, Natsnet Kfley, 17, said she was desperate to escape France for Britain. ‘It’s not good here. I’ve been here for three months and it is cold and horrible,’ she said. ‘I need to send back money to my family to help them. I will do any job – I can work in an office, no problem.’","Increasing numbers of lone women are queuing up to get into Britain .

"It is already the wardrobe staple and fashion safety net that women trust to turn 'fat' days into 'fab' days, and now it seems that the trusty LBD is good for your wallet too. New research shows that the Little Black Dress (LBD) has an 11 year life span, with the average British woman claiming to have worn their favourite LBD more than 140 times.

The ultimate LBD is definitely a treasured possession: the average LBD was owned for ‘seven years’, with 'four more years' cited as wardrobe life expectancy for the item. That equates to the average LBD being worn an impressive 143 times in total. When asked what they liked most about their favourite LBD almost half, 47 per cent, felt it made them look good and 33 per cent said it was simply because it made them feel good.

"Cared for: Tina Papalabropoulos, 23, suffered from learning disabilities, epilepsy, a form of dwarfism and a severe curvature of the spine . A disabled woman died in hospital because doctors believed her life ‘was not worth saving’, a charity claimed yesterday. Tina Papalabropoulos, 23, developed pneumonia days after suffering a bad cough. In a highly critical report, the health ombudsman said doctors missed chances to save her life. Mencap called the death ‘an avoidable tragedy’. Miss Papalabropoulos suffered from learning disabilities, epilepsy, a form of dwarfism and a severe curvature of the spine and was cared for by her parents. In January 2009 she developed a cough and a GP visited her home in Wickford, Essex, and told her parents to give her antibiotics. A request for a second visit the next day was ignored, although the GP did telephone the family, and the GP’s out-of-hours service refused a home visit until more than 24 hours later. Miss Papalabropoulos was eventually admitted to Basildon Hospital but then had to wait four days before she was seen by a respiratory consultant. The trust was criticised for a ‘prolonged delay’ in her treatment including failing to administer antibiotics immediately and not moving her to a high dependency unit. Her parents said they were initially told she had a minor infection but claimed a ‘do not resuscitate’ sign was put on her bed two hours after she was admitted. Doctors said they would not attempt to revive her as it would break her ribs, and one senior consultant allegedly told her parents they should not be afraid of the word ‘die’, before repeating: ‘Die, die, die.’ Treatment: Miss Papalabropoulos was eventually admitted to Basildon Hospital (pictured) but then had to wait four days before she was seen by a respiratory consultant . Doctors also allowed Mrs Papalabropoulos, . 56, and her husband Christo, 57, to give their daughter food and . drink, when she should have been fed intravenously to stop fluid getting . into her lungs. She died five days after she was admitted to hospital. Her mother said: ‘There was a complete lack of compassion from everyone. There were basic hospital treatments that she was denied because she was a disabled person. ‘Tina was an angel. She couldn’t talk or walk but she was able to communicate with us. If they had done their best then I could have accepted the way she died. But they didn’t.’ The health ombudsman’s report said: ‘We found that doctors had missed any opportunity there might have been –however small – to save her life by providing earlier and more intensive treatment for her.’ The ombudsman partly upheld Mr and Mrs Papalabropoulos’ complaints about Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and South East Essex Emergency Doctors Service, the GPs’ out-of-hours service but said it was impossible to know if she would have survived if she had received better treatment. 'Doctors held the view that Tina’s life was not worth saving, due to her disability' Beverley Dawkins, Mencap . Mencap policy manager Beverley Dawkins said: ‘Doctors held the view that Tina’s life was not worth saving, due to her disability.’ A spokesman for Basildon NHS trust said: ‘Since then [2009] the hospital has made significant improvement to the care and treatment we provide our patients with learning disabilities and we continue to listen to our patients, the families and carers to find out what further enhancements can be made.’","Health ombudsman says doctors missed chances to save 23-year-old's life .

"Amir Khan's car collection appears to have got even more impressive, after the boxer posed with a Lamborghini Aventador on his official Instagram account. Khan is a known car enthusiast and the addition of an Aventador would come as no surprise given that the 28-year-old already owns a Bentley Continental, a Mercedes CLS63, Audi R8 and two Rangers Rovers - because why wouldn't you have two? The Aventador retails at around £300,000 and boasts an incredible set of specs, managing 0-62mph in 2.9 seconds and reaching a top speed of 217mph.

Fuel tank capacity: 90 litres (23.8 gal.) Engine oil capacity: 13 litres (3.4 gal.) Distribution: Only 200 units were made . While Khan uploaded the picture to his Instagram account, it is unclear whether he was merely posing with the super-car or has added it to his impressive fleet of cars. Khan is angling for a fight later this year against Floyd Mayweather, who last month posted a picture with his own Lamborghini Aventador - and seven other super-cars and a £30m private jet for good measure. Khan recently caused a stir after claiming that he thought the proposed fight between Manny Pacquiao and Mayweather will never happen. 'Honestly that fight will never happen, in my opinion,' he told BT Sport. 'I spoke to Manny Pacquiao and, obviously, we speak to Mayweather and his team .

"Twitter has refused to take action over pornographic images posted on its site despite fears that children are being exposed to them. Half a million explicit pictures are published on the site every day – with pornographers now ‘cynically’ using the social network to target the young. But because the website is not classified as pornographic, the pictures can be seen even in households with child internet filters in place, campaigners say. Half a million explicit pictures are published on Twitter every day – with pornographers ‘cynically’ using it to target the young. MPs say Twitter bosses have resisted calls to block or filter illicit content on the website . MPs say Twitter bosses have resisted calls to block or filter illicit content on the website. A senior MP told the Mail Twitter bosses had snubbed a meeting with Government ministers on how to tackle internet porn. They failed to send anyone to the high-level meeting, instead offering to have a member of staff from Dublin ‘phone in’. Other major internet companies – including Facebook and Google – agreed to attend the summit chaired by Culture Minister Ed Vaizey. Labour MP Helen Goodman, a former shadow culture minister, last night said Twitter was failing to take the ‘cynical’ targeting of children by pornographers on Twitter seriously. ‘Neither Twitter nor Tumblr could be bothered to send anybody to a meeting with a government minister,’ she said. ‘I think [online porn] is a really serious problem but I don’t think they take it seriously.’ And she said there was a clear problem with pornographers taking advantage of the fact the site was able to sidestep internet controls. Because Twitter is not classified as pornographic the pictures can be seen even in households with child internet filters in place - critics say lax controls mean the site is saturated with pornographic images . An investigation earlier this week into the issue revealed that as many as 500,000 sexual images are posted on Twitter daily, including images of hardcore and extreme sexual practices. Remarkably, it is believed there are now more pictures of porn on Twitter than there are of pets. But unlike other websites, such as Facebook and YouTube, the company does not have a policy of blocking such images. Twitter is being increasingly exploited by pornographers to publicise their explicit material. The social network is not restricted by family-friendly internet filters as these only block specific web addresses, rather than a website’s content. As Twitter is not blocked by filters, there is no control on the images published on it. This means people can publish graphic images, including videos of hardcore sex acts, on their Twitter ‘feeds’ without being blocked. The graphic images are used as a way of luring internet surfers to spend money on their services, for example by buying more explicit pictures or by paying to watch explicit videos. And although Twitter says it has a minimum age limit of 13, it does not ask people to verify their age when they set up an account. The pornographic Twitter accounts are often labelled ’18 +’ but the social network does not have any mechanism in place to check users’ ages. In fact, the ’18 +’ label can be used to help people – including curious young people – to search for pornographic material. Nor does it actively monitor explicit content on its website, stating only that users who publish ‘sensitive’ material should mark it as such, so that other people on the social network are warned before they click to view the material. Users are also able to label graphic images as ‘sensitive’, at which point it will be sent to Twitter’s team to review. And although the social network removes profile photographs or background images that contain pornographic content, it does not do anything to remove any of the explicit images published in Twitter ‘feeds’. Anyone who ‘follows’ or searches a porn actor on Twitter can gain easy access to graphic images and videos. Critics say these lax controls have meant the site is becoming saturated with pornographic images. Campaigners last night accused the company of ‘cynical’, ‘exploitative’ behaviour, and said it was ‘taking the coward’s way out’ by failing to crack down on the issue. John Carr, of the UK Council for Child Internet Safety, said: ‘We know that exposure to porn has damaging effects on many young children, and yet it is freely available on Twitter. 'Twitter has got a huge responsibility and it’s failing to live up to it.’ Twitter has 15 million users in the UK, of which one million are thought to be child accounts. The Daily Mail has been highlighting the dangers of the easy access to adult images online as part of its Block Online Porn campaign. David Cameron persuaded the large internet providers to make it much easier for parents to impose a filter to stop their children stumbling across such material. When a family sets up a device, the option of choosing a filter is ‘on’ – meaning parents have to specifically ‘de-click’ if they do not want it to be installed.","Pornographers 'cynically' use social network Twitter to target the young .

"Nigel Farage was locked in a bitter war of words with the Conservatives last night over the credibility of a defector with links to a convicted kidnapper. The anti-EU party had been left licking its wounds on Saturday night when Ukip MEP Amjad Bashir announced he was leaving for the Tories. But Mr Farage hit back yesterday, saying Mr Bashir had already been facing suspension over a string of issues, including claims that he had links to a man jailed for his involvement in a kidnap plot in Pakistan and alleged expenses irregularities. Ukip MEP Amjad Bashir announced over the weekend he was leaving for the Tories, prompting the party's leader Nigel Farage (left) to hit back, saying Mr Bashir (right) had been facing suspension over several issues . The Ukip leader launched an all-out assault on Mr Bashir’s record, claiming party officials had been ‘increasingly alarmed by his behaviour over the past few months’. He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show that Mr Bashir ‘didn’t tell us the truth’ about the alleged employment of illegal immigrants in his restaurant business and warned there are ‘some big open questions in Brussels about money’. There were also claims of interference in candidate selection in Keighley, West Yorkshire, and links with ‘political extremists’ from Pakistan. Ukip suspended Mr Bashir on Saturday evening after getting wind that he was about to defect. The MEP, who was once paraded by Ukip as a symbol of the party’s diversity, yesterday accused his former leader of a ‘desperate attempt’ to smear him. Mr Bashir said there was ‘not a shred of truth’ in the allegations made against him. He claimed last night that Mr Farage had even asked him to stand for Parliament last week – a claim dismissed by Ukip last night as ‘risible’. Mr Farage said he was ‘genuinely surprised’ the Conservatives had accepted Mr Bashir into the party. In a further twist last night, Respect MP George Galloway claimed his party de-selected Mr Bashir as a council candidate ahead of the 2012 local elections. The Bradford West MP refused to say what the issues were that led to Mr Bashir’s sacking ‘but they were sufficiently grave to make us realise that he was not a fit and proper person to represent Respect’. He added: ‘Clearly both Ukip and the Tories have lower standards.’ A Tory source last night said Mr Bashir denied ever having any involvement with the Left-wing Respect party. Four million EU citizens living in the UK should be barred from voting in a referendum on Britain’s relationship with Europe, Nigel Farage said yesterday. Setting out his terms for a post-election deal with the Conservatives, the Ukip leader claimed he wanted ‘fair’ rules for the In/Out ballot pledged by David Cameron. Mr Farage said: ‘I want a guarantee that the only people that can vote are British citizens because at the moment there are four million or so EU citizens living in Britain.’ Currently, EU citizens can vote in local and European elections, and in referendums – many took part in last year’s Scottish independence vote. But Eurosceptics believe they could sway the result in favour of Britain staying in the EU. Mr Bashir’s defection was presented as a major coup by the Conservatives, who are trying to squeeze Ukip’s vote ahead of the General Election. David Cameron said he was ‘absolutely delighted’ by the Yorkshire and Humber MEP’s decision. Tory party chairman Grant Shapps yesterday brushed aside claims against Mr Bashir, which include his on-going friendship with Mujeeb Bhutto, who was sentenced to seven years in jail in the UK after admitting his role as the head of a kidnapping gang in Pakistan. Ukip claimed Mr Bashir had failed to end his association with Bhutto, despite warnings last year. But Mr Shapps defended him, saying: ‘I’m absolutely satisfied that this is somebody mainstream... I’m absolutely satisfied that he is a very moderate MEP who has seen that the only way to deliver what he wants is through the Conservatives.’ He added that ‘they [Ukip] want you to believe that they were going to get rid of this guy, exactly the opposite is the case’. Mr Bashir claimed Mr Farage ‘runs the party like a dictator’ and said the party had ‘outlived its usefulness’ because the Tories were now the best hope of a referendum on Europe. He said: ‘I have decided to leave Ukip because it has become a vanity project for Nigel Farage and because many of the criticisms made of the party are true. David Cameron famously said that Ukip was a party of “fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists”. ‘Certainly, I have experienced racism in Ukip. I have been racially abused on social media by other Ukip members who ask offensive questions like, “Are you a Muslim?” ’ Ukip denied he had been subjected to racism. Party sources said allegations of financial irregularities in Brussels would be passed to police. How this election coup turned into a debacle for Dave . A series of controversies in the political life of Ukip turncoat Amjad Bashir should have set alarm bells ringing among the Tory high command. But questionable behaviour, dating back nearly a year, was either missed or overlooked by the Conservatives in their haste to secure a high-profile defector to their cause. The resulting controversy has overshadowed what should have been a major coup for David Cameron. In February 2014, Mr Bashir was ordered by Ukip to break off all relations with a friend, political activist Mujeeb Bhutto, after it was revealed Bhutto had a conviction for leading a kidnapping gang in Pakistan. Despite this, Mr Bashir was seen with Bhutto earlier this month at a hustings in Keighley, West Yorkshire, where there are allegations of vote-rigging that are now the subject of an internal inquiry. Posing for the cameras: MEP Amjad Bashir (left) with Prime Minister David Cameron at the weekend . In July last year, the Pakistani-born businessman was again warned about his political associates. As recently as last week, the Ukip MEP was summoned to a meeting with party leader Nigel Farage where he was due to be handed an ‘ultimatum’ over his conduct following the incident in Keighley. Ukip allege that he did not show up, although Mr Bashir claimed last night that Mr Farage had made no mention of an ultimatum and had instead invited him to stand for Parliament. The colourful allegations against Mr Bashir should have been enough to raise concerns – or at least provoke further investigation – at Conservative Campaign Headquarters (CCHQ). Yet it appears that any questions over his behaviour or political associations were swept aside by the Tories in their rush to secure his defection. Three days later, Mr Bashir confirmed to his Tory contacts that he was prepared to jump ship from Ukip. A hurried meeting was arranged with David Cameron before the Prime Minister flew to Saudi Arabia for the funeral of King Abdullah. Acquaintances: MEP Amjad Bashir (centre right) with Mujeeb Bhutto (far right) and Ukip's Nigel Farage (left) CCHQ also arranged a secretly recorded and embargoed interview with the BBC to be rolled out on announcement of the news. But the next day at 4pm Ukip somehow learned of Mr Bashir’s defection plans. Within an hour and a half it was announced he was being suspended pending investigations into ‘extremely serious’ allegations. Ukip also began to ‘accelerate’ disciplinary proceedings against their MEP. Half an hour later, the party formally received his resignation and his defection was confirmed. But thanks to Ukip’s intervention, and the resulting row, a series of pre-arranged interviews with broadcasters were cancelled by the Tories. The end result was a botched defection which risks leaving CCHQ with egg on its face amid questions over what, if any, due diligence had been carried out by Tory planners on their new recruit.","MEP Amjad Bashir said 'Ukip is pointless' before defecting to Tory party .

"A Polish gang who launched a brutal attack on a top academic walked in through Britain’s open borders despite horrific criminal records. Professor Paul Kohler, 55, suffered appalling injuries when he was beaten in front of his family at his £2million home. Images of the battered face of the law expert, a father of four and university friend of Prince Edward, shocked the nation as police mounted an international manhunt. Now it can be revealed that the four men are all career criminals who saw Britain’s wealthy suburbs as a soft target. Their burly ringleader was on the run from a Polish prison and had already served three sentences for a gun attack, theft, burglary and drugs offences. Scroll down for video . Celebration: Paul Kohler with his family. They were playing a board game when the raiders burst into their £2m home. Inset: His face after the attack . Academic Paul Kohler (pictured left after the attack and right today), 55, needed facial reconstruction surgery for a fractured eye socket after he was set upon by a gang of balaclava-clad men . He and all three accomplices have a string of convictions in their homeland, including similar violent robberies. The revelations will increase the pressure on ministers to regain control of the borders and carry out proper checks on violent EU nationals coming to Britain. They follow the row over the murder of schoolgirl Alice Gross by Latvian Arnis Zalkalns, whom police discovered was a convicted killer. Yesterday, Prof Kohler sat silently with his wife Samantha MacArthur at Kingston Crown Court as the four men pleaded guilty. The head of law at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London still bears the scars of the attack. He was badly beaten when the masked gang burst into his three-storey Edwardian home in Wimbledon, South West London, on August 11 while his family were playing a board game. They pinned him to the floor and threatened to smash a heavy wooden cabinet over his head while screaming: ‘Where’s the money?’ Gang members: Pawel Honc, 23, and Mariusz Tomaszewski, 32, were arrested by police at the scene of the attack and today admitted aggravated burglary and causing grievous bodily harm with intent . Co-accused: Oskar Pawlowicz, 29, of Mitcham, and Dawid Tychon, 29, of no fixed abode, also admitted aggravated burglary, but charges of GBH were dropped against the pair after they pleaded not guilty . His wife was also threatened by two of the intruders, who tried to tie her to a chair with duct tape. The terrified couple were saved by one of their four daughters, Eloise, 24, who barricaded herself in her room and dialled 999. Officers arrived within seconds and arrested Mariusz Tomaszewski, 32, and Pawel Honc, 23, who were both covered in blood. Ringleader Dawid Tychon, 29, was arrested six days later driving a suspected stolen car – while wearing an England football shirt – and later linked to the robbery by his mobile phone. He was caught with a bewildering array of drugs, including cocaine, cannabis, amphetamines and other stimulants. Police also found a potentially deadly gas-powered flame thrower in the boot of his car. The fourth man, Oskar Pawlowichz, 29, was captured a month later when police traced him to a property in Leominster, Herefordshire. Police quickly discovered that the men were all career criminals who used their size and strength to overpower victims. None of the four, who all practised bodybuilding and martial arts, knew each other in Poland but they became friends through a heavy-drinking clique. Victims: Mr Kohler’s wife, Samantha MacArthur (left), was also threatened by two of the intruders who tried to tie her to a chair with duct tape during the break-in on August 11 . Panic: As Mr Kohler was attacked, he called out to Ms MacArthur asking her to ring the police, a move he said he instantly regretted because it alerted the burglars to her whereabouts . Tychon fled his homeland in 2012 while on the run from prison where he was serving a long sentence for theft and burglary. His right hand man was football hooligan Tomaszewski, who came to Britain in 2013 after being released from an eight-year jail sentence. Labelled a ‘very dangerous person’ on police files, he is a dedicated follower of the Cracovia football club in Krakow, his hometown. Police suspect he was a member of a criminal gang associated with the club and is responsible for badly beating other men during street brawls. Shaven-headed Pawlowichz was caught on CCTV fleeing Prof Kohler’s home and went on the run. Home: Mr Kohler said he was 'ecstatic' that the gang had admitted the burglary at his home in Wimbledon, south east London (right) The thug, from Tarnow in south-east Poland, has served two jail sentences in his homeland for violent assaults. Their guilty pleas come just weeks after a devastating report revealed the £1billion-a-year failure by successive governments to police Britain’s borders. Foreign offenders are able to walk into the country unchecked, commit new offences – then avoid deportation on human rights grounds once their jail terms are complete, spending watchdog the National Audit Office found. It said 1,400 foreign criminals are living here who should have been turned away at the border. Conservative backbencher Peter Bone said yesterday: ‘This is yet another one of the very many reasons why we need to control our borders, stop the free movement and only let in people we want.’ Notorious: Career criminal Dawid Tychon . Each gang member was let into the UK despite a long criminal record. Here, we reveal the shocking scale of their offending. The Bodybuilder . Dawid Tychon is a violent career criminal who masterminded the raid but tried to persuade police he was only the getaway driver. Wanted by the Polish prison authorities and at least two forces, the 29-year-old is a violent gangster linked to robberies, drugs and car crime. He has already served three jail sentences in his native country for an attack involving a gun, theft, burglary and drugs offences. Tychon, an unemployed labourer, revelled in his notoriety, flexing his muscles and wearing hooded tops for photographs he posted online. The soccer thug . Die-hard football hooligan Mariusz Tomaszewski fled Poland where police files described him as a ‘very dangerous man’. He served eight years in prison for violent offences and arrived in Britain in 2013 to continue his life of crime while living with his pregnant girlfriend. Tomaszewski lost a job at Heathrow Airport after oversleeping on the first day and instead spent his days drinking and smoking cannabis. His ex-wife, who divorced him in 2003 and has started a new life in Austria with their teenage son, said she was horrified at what he has done. ‘I knew that he was only recently let out of jail in Poland so for him to be back inside again so soon is crazy,’ she said. The Henchmen . The final gang members Oskar Pawlowichz, 29, and Pawel Honc, 23, both have lengthy criminal records, police said. Pawlowichz, 29, who was caught on CCTV fleeing the robbery, has served two jail sentences in his native country for violent assaults. A brunette, who appears to be his estranged wife Eliza, posted a series of messages online after his arrest, including a social media ‘status update’ that read ‘DEAD!!’ Apparently referring to his crime, she added: ‘When a person dies there remains after him on this earth nothing but the good which he did to others.’ Speaking after the guilty pleas, Prof Kohler – whose view of the defendants was blocked by frosted glass – said the motive behind the attack remains a ‘complete mystery’. One theory police investigated was that the gang were looking for takings from the family’s tiny cabaret bar, the Cellar Door, on The Strand in Central London. But Prof Kohler remains convinced it is a simple case of mistaken identity and said police could find nothing linking the gang to him. He said he is recovering well, despite problems with his left eye, but said his wife and children remain ‘quite traumatised by it all’. ‘They pleaded guilty because the evidence against them was overwhelming. But I still want to look in their eyes and see their faces,’ he added. Asked whether his part ownership of the bar could be behind the robbery, Prof Kohler said: ‘There was no money, I have never got anything for God’s sake. They just didn’t believe it. Academics do not attract enemies – well, we do but they are not those who would employ violent thugs.’ Family: Mr Kohler with his daughters Saskia and Tamara. His other daughter Eloise was in the house at the time of the attack and called police to the scene . Honc, of no fixed abode, and Tomaszewski, from Mitcham, pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm with intent and aggravated burglary. Pawlowichz, of Mitcham, and Tychon, of no fixed abode, both admitted a single charge of aggravated burglary. Barristers for all four men said they wanted to express their ‘sincere regret and apologies’. Judge Susan Tapping remanded them in custody and warned them that they can expect to receive substantial prison terms. They will be sentenced on January 29. Detective Inspector Dan O’Sullivan, who led the inquiry, said: ‘This was an cowardly and vicious attack on an innocent family.’ Aftermath: Mr Kohler said he was ‘unrecognisable’ with swelling on the side of his head the size of a football, and blood flowing from his mouth and eyes .","Paul Kohler, 55, needed facial reconstruction surgery after raid in August .

"Passengers on a Saga holiday have complained they were effectively asked to ‘pay the crew’s wages’ after being urged to tip £8 a day. Travellers on the ‘all-inclusive’ tour of the Croatian Dalmatian islands were allegedly told by a guide that the gratuity was the company’s ‘own recommendations’ which would be shared among the ship’s crew of seven. But with 30 passengers on board for the eight-day cruise, they calculated this worked out as £274 per crew member. Scroll down for video . Passengers on board a Saga holiday complained they were effectively asked to 'pay the crew's wages' after they were urged to tip £8 a day . ‘All the passengers felt that this was a con,’ one traveller on the MV Emanuel said. ‘The general conclusion was that Saga was not paying the crew’s wages, but was asking the passengers to pay them instead.’ The seven-night holiday, which costs up to £1,250 per person, is advertised as including travel insurance, return flights and transfers, full board, local wines, beers and soft drinks with lunch and dinner throughout the cruise, excursions and a free bar open 11 hours a day. The tour includes the Unesco World Heritage sites of Dubrovnik and Split, national park of Mljet and the islands of Brac and Hvar. Saga said customers are told to ‘use their own discretion’ on how much to tip. A spokesman for the firm said: ‘We pay the commercial market rate for chartering the ships on these holidays. In the light of this complaint, we will be reminding the ship owners of our policies regarding gratuities.’ The payment of tips on cruises is a long-running issue between some cruise companies and their customers. Many tour operators that are not all inclusive automatically add tips from adult guests to bills, typically of around £3-£6 a day. In most cases the amount can be altered or completely removed if requested. However, some cruise lines send passengers a letter to their cabin asking them to reconsider if they ask to have the tips taken off the bill. The holiday tour visited Unesco World Heritage Sites such as Dubrovnik (pictured) and Split in Croatia . Crew on some liners are said to compile a list of people who have removed their gratuities – nicknamed the ‘spit-list’ – which is posted in staff communal areas. Costa holidays automatically add a fixed service charge of £5.50 per person per day to bills and 15 per cent on drinks bills for all guests over 14. Those aged between four and 14 are charged half that amount. The company warns: ‘The service charge is used by the company to incentivise staff who perform hotel duties and to continually improve the quality of service offered on board Costa ships. ‘The service charge is an integral part of the total price of the cruise and therefore the amount cannot be altered.’ Crews on US-based cruise companies have been known to express disappointment when asked to join cruises leaving the UK because Britons are believed to be worse tippers than Americans.","Saga holiday passengers say they were urged to pay £8 a day in tips .

Madalena, 39, told Brazil's Cidade Verde website: 'We want to get my . mother out while there is still time. This man has messed up her head, . it's like she's been brainwashed.' Authorities kept a close watch on the children placed in care homes over fears they had been instructed to take their own lives at the same time. During the operation, a 'significant quantity' of rat poison was found at the residence, a police spokesman said. After the raid, military police . commander Alberto Meneses said: 'This was an unusual situation, because . when religion is involved everything is possible and nothing is . predictable.' Santos, known to his flock as Daddy . Luis, had claimed an angel visited four years ago telling him the exact time . the world was going to end. Last . month, the 43-year-old spiritual leader instructed his 113 followers to . leave their jobs, give away all their possessions and take their . children out of school, police confirmed. 'Worried': Military police arrive at the house the cult calls 'the Ark' to take away 19 babies and children after receiving 'credible' information the group planned to kill themselves . The . group then holed up inside a ten-bedroom house, which they called The Ark. The . end of the world was predicted on a public holiday in Brazil, the . feast day of the country's patron saint Our Lady of Aparecida, as well . as national Children's Day. Although the group didn't put up any resistance, one of the cult members, Maria Francisca Alves, 38, whose 12-year-old daughter was taken away by police, protested the action. Asked why she had taken her daughter out of school, she said: 'We're preparing for the end of the world, so what's the point of studying? Learning the word of God is more important.' Children's judge Maria Luiza de Moura, who issued the protection order, said: 'We believe that a mass suicide or murder may happen using a soup ingested by cult members. 'The adults are free to act of their free and spontaneous will, but we have to make sure that nothing happens to the children.' The police chief leading the investigation, Joatan Goncalves, said: 'Our worry is if there are offered a toxic product claiming to offer salvation on Friday.' Death threat: Police hold back onlookers. Officers said they found a 'significant quantity' of rat poison at the house . In an interview with Brazil's Terra website, divorced father-of-five Santos, a former caretaker, said he didn't fear the police and denied that the group were planning to drink poison. He said: 'I preach the gospel and it says thou shalt no kill. We will be saved and raptured in another way.' The former Catholic said most of his followers are former street beggars, prostitutes, drug dealers and criminals which God had told him to 'save'. He said: 'I received a message telling me to be a shepherd to lost sheep. I am Christ's advocate. From Friday night there will be only darkness, because the beast will come out of the abyss and the world will end. 'People call me crazy, even my wife abandoned me, but I am sure that there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth and the good people will be taken away.' After Santos was arrested, police occupied the building where the rest of the cult members remain. The largest recorded cult suicide was in 1978 when People's Temple leader Jim Jones inspired 918 of his followers to kill themselves in Guyana by drinking cyanide. From 1994 to 1997, members of the Order of the Solar Temple sect began a series of mass suicides, which lead to around 74 deaths. In 1997, 39 followers of the Heaven's Gate cult died in a mass suicide in Rancho Santa Fe, California, believing their souls would journey aboard a spaceship they believed to be following the Hale-Bopp comet.","Authorities believed the group were preparing to drink soup laced with poison .

"Her lingering looks, flirtatious manner and suggestive descriptions of food have made Nigella Lawson as much a sex symbol as a cook. But yesterday the Domestic Goddess insisted she was mystified by her reputation as a culinary coquette. Miss Lawson admitted finding eating sensual and talking about it in an intimate way, but the 54-year-old denied using innuendo to describe her dishes. Scroll down for video . Nigella Lawson insists she is mystified by reputation as a culinary coquette but admits eating food is sensual . She said: ‘Certainly, I have an intimate style of talking and that can be construed as coquettishness. But believe me, I have nothing of the coquette about me.’ She claimed she was also singled out for her healthy appetite because women were still expected to eat daintily. Nigella, pictured here on her own show Nigellissima, is planning to make a comeback on television in the UK . The TV chef and author added: ‘When I’m told I am full of innuendo, I am mystified. I am the least salacious person. ‘I don’t know if that misconception is because women are still meant to be like Scarlett O’Hara and pick like a bird, and that somehow seeing a woman enjoy food and having an appetite is regarded as wanton lasciviousness. ‘I’m not complaining. Food is sensual. But the conversation is still me, intimate and – like my cooking style – somewhat haphazard, as I am never scripted.’ However, she admitted some of her descriptions bordered on the provocative, telling Observer Food Monthly magazine: ‘Maybe I do sometimes go over the top. I have a nervous need to fill the silence.’ Miss Lawson is planning a UK comeback following her US TV show The Taste. She revealed how she never follows a recipe at home, adding: ‘I’m certainly clumsy, and generally when I cook I don’t have a recipe. ‘As for how the food looks – it’s messy, but for me messiness is beautiful.’","Miss Lawson admitted finding eating sensual and talking about it intimately .

"After Black Friday saw people fighting in the aisles and having to be restrained by police as they clamoured for the latest deals, experts predict Britain's enthusiasm for a bargain will continue on Cyber Monday as it is likely to be the biggest shopping day of the year. Around six million people are expected to log onto the internet tomorrow and spend around £650million on the latest pre-Christmas deals. Retailers hope the success of Black Friday will continue, with some stores already notching up record sales - such as Amazon which sold 5.5m items on Friday at a rate of 64 purchases a second. Scroll down for video . Online shoppers are expected to spend £650m on Cyber Monday after the popularity of Black Friday. Amazon has already listed bargains, with Ultrasport UmovE HD 60 Sport and Action Camera ill (left) cut from £119.99 to £69.99 and a UTC by Orla Kiely Buttercup Stem Printed Nylon Zip Shopper cut from £58.33 to £37.99 (right) A man's Accurist Quartz Watch with Black Dial Chronograph Display is reduced from £125 to £49.99 (left), children's Trunki ride on suitcase is to be slashed from £33.99 to £23.90 (centre), Seksy by Sekonda Women's Quartz Watch with Silver Dial Analogue Display has been reduced from £59.99 to £29.99 (right) for Monday . Cyber Monday is likely to be a calmer affair as it is confined to online purchases, but sales traditionally outstrip those of Black Friday. Recent years have seen online shopping figures consistently peaking on the first Monday in December, thought to be a combination of the last payday before Christmas falling on the previous Friday and a weekend spent browsing the shops before buying online. Experian and the Interactive in Media Group (IMRG) predicts £649million will be spent during this year's Cyber Monday. Amazon, will continue its success of the last week by releasing 'lightning deals' every 10 minutes on Monday on items such as Sennheiser Headphones, Harry Potter Hogwarts Collection on DVD and ruby jewellery. This year the online retailer has hired 13,000 extra staff to deal with pre-Christmas demand and predicts this year's Cyber Monday could still outstrip Black Friday sales. Last year sales on Monday were higher than those on Black Friday. And as Amazon beat its 2013 Cyber Monday record of 4.1million on Friday this year, the retailer is hopeful for another record day. A spokeswoman for Amazon said: 'Cyber Monday has been the biggest day of the year for internet retailers but the incredible success of Black Friday means that it will have to be a huge day for that to be the case this year. 'We are ready for whatever the day brings with thousands of members of the Amazon team across the UK prepped and ready to pick, pack and deliver the millions of items that will be ordered.' While some retailers such as Tesco remained tight-lipped about Cyber Monday deals, Amazon has already released some details of upcoming discounts. Stores are hoping the success of Black Friday, which led to record sales, will be repeated on Cyber Monday . Dyson also confirmed there will be discounts of more than £100 on some hoovers. Peak times for sales are forecast to be from 12pm until 2pm and for tablet users from 5pm to 6pm, likely to be during the journey home. Vice President of EU Retail at Amazon, Xavier Garambois, said: 'Ever since we introduced Black Friday to the UK in 2010, sales have increased year on year but this year really has surpassed all of our expectations.' John Lewis, which saw traffic to its website increase by 306 per cent between midnight and 8am on Monday, confirmed it will not be taking part in this year's Cyber Monday. A spokeswoman said Black Friday led to 'unprecedented levels of customer interest', with an iPad mini the most popular item. During the morning the retailer sold a Nutribullet - the latest health craze that breaks down food into its most nutritious form - every 30 seconds. Stores are also likely to be spending the weekend preparing for the increased demand, as the websites of John Lewis, Argos and Tesco all temporarily crashed on Friday. Visitors to the Currys website were also left waiting up to an hour to see online deals. Other stores will be continuing their Black Friday deals over the weekend and into Monday. ASOS  is offering 20 per cent off every purchase until midnight on Monday and Marks and Spencer is continuing a 30 per cent deal on some items. Amazon has employed 13,000 extra staff to deal with the pre-Christmas rush this year and after posting a record Black Friday, Cyber Monday sales could exceed this making its Peterborough warehouse even busier . However experts are also warning customers to watch out for deals that appear more attractive than they are - with some items on sale for cheaper prices months earlier. Jim McLauchlan, chief executive of price tracker website zeezaw.co.uk told the Sunday Times: 'Many Amazon offers are genuinely attractive bargains but other more general discounts, while pretty reasonable, could have been obtained for less in the least few months. It may not be the cheapest time to buy.' Cyber Monday will complete a successful weekend for the high street. On Saturday footfall in Oxford Street was seven per cent higher than the year before. Jace TyrrelI, deputy chief executive of the New West End company, said: 'We're set to make £220 million across the West End for Friday, Saturday and Sunday - up between 5 to 10 per cent on last year.' Cyber Monday will be a far quieter affair than Black Friday where fights broke out, police had to be called, and  a woman pinned herself to bag a cut-price 40"" television at an Asda superstore in Wembley in London . Mr Tyrrell predicted that while shoppers would be returning to work on Monday, they would continue shopping online. The busiest shopping day on the high street often falls two days before Christmas Day, however Mr Tyrrell suggested this weekend would be the biggest trading weekend of the year. 'The nature of shopping is gifting,' he said, 'Whereas as you get closer to Christmas it becomes closer to groceries.' This year's Black Friday caused chaos on the high street - with police called to a Tesco store in Wigan and 11.37pm - before it had even opened - following reports that several hundred customers were trying to break down the doors. In Manchester another Tesco had to be closed 38 minutes after it opened because of customers fighting. Shoppers were predicted to have blown £1.1billion on the high street, working out at £2million per minute during the nine hours of trading, according to figures from the Centre for Retail Research.","Experts predict Cyber Monday could see more sales than Black Friday .

"Missouri Governor Jay Nixon has come under fire after calling for the 'vigorous prosecution' of the Ferguson police officer who shot dead unarmed black teenager Michael Brown. The Democrat governor released a five-minute video on Tuesday, where he said: 'A vigorous prosecution must now be pursued.' His statement began: 'Ten days ago, a police officer shot and killed Michael Brown in broad daylight. The world has watched as a community has been engulfed in grief, anger, fear, at times violence.' The governor then called upon Attorney-General Eric Holder and St Louis county prosecutor Bob McCulloch to 'meet expectations' by finding justice for Michael Brown and his family 'thoroughly, promptly and correctly'. Scroll down for video . Missouri Governor Jay Nixon said in a video address on Tuesday that he wanted a 'vigorous prosecution' of Officer Darren Wilson, who shot dead unarmed teenager Michael Brown on August 9 . Governor Nixon's call for the prosecution of Officer Darren Wilson comes ahead of any decisions by the grand jury who are meeting today to see if the 28-year-old will be charged. St Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch said on Wednesday that he estimated it would be the middle of October before the grand jury reached a decision on whether Officer Wilson will face charges over Michael Brown's death. Assistant prosecutors today began presenting evidence in the shooting death. The grand jury is racially diverse, McCulloch said, with three African-Americans, according to the St Louis Post-Dispatch and was selected in May to cover the current term. Wilson, a six-year veteran of the Ferguson force with a clean record, has not been arrested or charged with any crime. The Missouri Governor released a statement on Tuesday calling for justice for teenager Michael Brown who was shot dead on August 9 by Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson . He is on paid leave pending the outcome of the investigation and has been in hiding due to threats over his safety. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder arrived in Ferguson today where he has promised a 'fair, thorough and independent' investigation into the death of Michael Brown. President Obama ordered Holder to Missouri on Wednesday to bring the full weight of the federal government behind the investigation into the death of the black teen who was unarmed when a white police officer shot him six times on August 9. Holder has led an unusually fast and aggressive Justice Department response to the local case, sending teams of prosecutors and dozens of FBI agents to investigate and arranging a federal autopsy on top of one by local authorities. In a letter published on the St. Louis Post-Dispatch website, Holder also said the bond of trust between law enforcement and the public is 'all-important' but also 'fragile'. Arrest patterns 'must not lead to disparate treatment under the law, even if such treatment is unintended. And police forces should reflect the diversity of the communities they serve,' Holder wrote on Tuesday. He said the Justice Department would 'defend the right of protesters to peacefully demonstrate and for the media to cover a story that must be told.' Nixon, whose slow response to the Michael Brown shooting and over-militarization of the streets have been heavily criticized, drew outrage today following his calls for a 'vigorous prosecution'. His deputy, Missouri Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder, told Fox: 'It's really heartbreaking to see a man elected to an office that high in our state government ... come out with a statement like that, that does prejudge the case. 'It would be wrong for a prosecutor to say what the governor has said here tonight and it's wrong for the governor of Missouri to have said it.' MailOnline was unable to obtain a response from the governor's office today on his remarks but a press spokesman told Fox that the governor was not prejudging Officer Wilson's actions. Attorney-General Eric Holder arrived in Ferguson today to meet with FBI and other officials carrying out an independent federal investigation into Brown's death. The Justice Department has mounted an unusually swift and aggressive response to Brown's death, from an independent autopsy to dozens of FBI agents combing Ferguson for witnesses to the shooting. Wilson shot Brown at least six times, including twice in the head, after the officer stopped the 18-year-old for walking in the middle of the road shortly after noon on August 9. The officer reportedly said Brown punched him and tried to grab his gun before charging at him. Eye-witnesses of the shooting said that Brown had turned towards the police officer with his arms raised in surrender when he was shot dead. Brown's shooting has sparked ten days of violent protests in the St Louis suburb. Demonstrations were significantly calmer on Tuesday but overnight, the peaceful atmosphere disintegrated amid a series of clashes that led to 47 arrests, with police claiming they were pelted with bottles containing urine. Attorney General Eric Holder arrives  at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport in St Louis on Wednesday to oversee the federal government's investigation into the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown . St Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch (pictured on Tuesday) said today that it could be the middle of October before the grand jury will decide whether Officer Wilson will face charges . Governor Nixon also said on Tuesday that he would not seek the removal of the prosecutor overseeing the investigation into shooting of Brown. St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch's deep family connections to police have been cited by some black leaders who question his ability to be impartial. McCulloch's father, mother, brother, uncle and cousin all worked for the St. Louis Police Department, and his father was killed while responding to a call involving a black suspect. Nixon said he would not ask McCulloch to leave the case, citing the 'well-established process' by which prosecutors can recuse themselves from pending investigations to make way for a special prosecutor. Departing from that process, Nixon said in a statement, 'could unnecessarily inject legal uncertainty into this matter and potentially jeopardize the prosecution'. McCulloch, a Democrat, was elected in 1991 and has earned a reputation for being tough on crime. Police officers arrest a demonstrator on Tuesday night in Ferguson, Missouri. Violent outbreaks have taken place  since the shooting death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown by a Ferguson police officer . The streets of Ferguson filled once more with protesters on Tuesday evening, but the scene was much more subdued than on any of the previous five nights, with smaller crowds. For the hours, the protest was lively but peaceful. After midnight, tensions rose as officers tried to remove the relatively small number of protesters who had not left. Several people were seen in handcuffs before most of the remaining crowd headed home. Earlier in the day, Ferguson city leaders urged people to stay home after dark on Tuesday to 'allow peace to settle in' and pledged to try to improve the police force in the St. Louis suburb. In a public statement, the city said the mayor, the City Council and employees have been exploring ways to increase the number of African-American applicants to the law enforcement academy, develop incentive programs to encourage city residency for police officers and raise money for cameras that would be attached to patrol car dashboards and officers' vests. 'We plan to learn from this tragedy, as we further provide for the safety of our residents and businesses and progress our community through reconciliation and healing,' the statement said. Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Brown's family, said the 18-year-old's funeral and memorial service would be Monday. The time and location had not been finalized. Earlier on Tuesday, a large crowd gathered in nearby St. Louis after officers responding to a report of a store robbery shot and killed a knife-wielding man. Police Chief Sam Dotson said the suspect acted erratically and told responding officers to 'kill me now'. Some members of the crowd shouted, 'Hands up, don't shoot,' a phrase that has been a refrain of protests since Brown's death on August 9. Like Brown, the 23-year-old suspect killed on Tuesday was black.","Governor Jay Nixon said on Tuesday 'a vigorous prosecution must be pursued' after Ferguson officer Darren Wilson shot dead teen Michael Brown .

"Sacked: Margaret Rowe, 65, claims she lost her £184,000 a year job and objected to a boss circulating a nude portrait of his wife . A City lawyer who objected to a boss circulating a nude portrait of his wife to staff claims she lost her £184,000 a year job at ‘chauvinistic’ Fidelity Worldwide Investment because she refused to act like a woman who ‘knows her place’, a tribunal heard yesterday. Margaret Rowe, 65, objected when Fidelity’s head of portfolio management James Bateman showed junior women colleagues photographs of the full-frontal painting of his wife, Cambridge don Dr Victoria Bateman. The asset management firm says there was nothing prurient about the portrait of the Gonville and Caius College economist, which was featured in an exhibition. But Miss Rowe told the Central London employment tribunal: ‘Many people found the picture awkward. The women did not know how to react or not to react. 'It is unusual for a male boss to send to women on his staff a nude portrait with no context.’ Fidelity insists the almost life-size painting – which received publicity when it was shown at London’s Mall Galleries last year – was meant as a ‘challenge against the objectification of women’. Miss Rowe denies suggestions by the firm that she was too aggressive and was always looking for issues to complain about. ‘Some of the men in the office could not countenance the fact I was a woman who was assertive and forthright,’ said Miss Rowe, who is claiming unfair dismissal and sex discrimination. ‘They ignored or tolerated male behaviour which could perhaps be described as blameworthy. ‘I was seen as a woman who did not know her place. The culture was chauvinistic. ‘The senior management team was overwhelmingly male. It was deeply hierarchical and highly respectful of authority. 'When I thought something was important I would raise it, I couldn’t fall into line regardless of the hierarchy. ‘I was forthright while being caring and considerate of others, I had a strong personality and was respected by members of staff and was a mentor and adviser to more junior members of staff.’ Sacked lawyer's claim: James Bateman is said to have shown junior women colleagues photographs of the full-frontal painting of his wife . Miss Rowe joined Fidelity in 2007 as head of the investments legal team and within four years was earning £135,000 a year and picking up annual bonuses of £49,000. She said she was perceived as aggressive because she was forthright in her emails, using red and capitals, which she did not realise until later was considered shouting. She complained of victimisation last year after alleging she had not been given a proper chance to apply for a promotion. But she was fired after an independent investigation ordered by the human resources department found no evidence of sex discrimination or bullying, the tribunal heard. Miss Rowe, who lives in North London, said: ‘That was at the end of my career. I was 65 and believed I could have worked until 70. ‘It hurt me very deeply I was dismissed when I had gone out of my way to treat people with respect and dignity.’ Katherine Attisha, head of human resources at Fidelity, denied the men were sexist or treated her differently. She said Miss Rowe’s emails were ‘often very blunt’ and carried a ‘negative undertone’. ‘Her approach would often be directly critical and would frequently focus on the negative,’ she said. ‘She also frequently overstepped the mark from professional interaction to personal attack. Things would never have worked out unless Margaret altered her style and approach, something for which I had seen little or no evidence of her being willing or capable of doing. 'Margaret seemed ultra-sensitive – always looking for issues and ultimately it was as though she was almost expecting there to be a problem with any change. Controversial: The asset management firm says there was nothing prurient about the portrait of the Gonville and Caius College economist, Dr Victoria Bateman (left) which was featured in an exhibition . ‘I was sorry when, ultimately, my efforts to help Margaret to make a success of her role failed, but looking back I’m not sure there was any way we could have ultimately succeeded given the approach she took.’ Miss Rowe was accused by one boss of ‘playing the woman card’ when it suited her, the tribunal heard. Nicola McCabe, head of investment trusts at Fidelity, said she was told by executive director Peter Yandle that ‘when Ms Rowe didn’t like the outcome of a discussion or an outcome of a decision that she could then say this was because she was a woman rather than the fact that it was a business decision. ‘And so he said she will use and first play the woman card .... (and) would state at that point that it was because she was a woman rather than there was a difference of view as to how things could proceed.’ The tribunal continues.","Margaret Rowe lost £184,000 a year job at Fidelity Worldwide Investment .

"The parents of a one-year-old child have to save her life up to five times a day - because a rare genetic condition means she forgets to breathe. Jess Kerr needs her parents, Melanie and Simon, to give her the kiss of life every time she stops breathing. The baby, from Leicester, suffers from an extremely rare condition that affects less than 200 babies in the UK every year. Jess Kerr's parents have to save her life up to five times a day - because a rare genetic condition means she forgets to breathe. The one-year-old's parents, Melanie and Simon, have to give her the kiss of life every time she stops breathing . Jess has Patau syndrome, which is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 13 in every cell. The condition only affects 200 babies a year in the UK . She has battled the life-threatening condition, known as Patau syndrome, since birth and requires round-the-clock care to keep her alive. Her mother said: ‘I was crushed when doctors told us about Jess’s condition, it was just devastating. ‘My husband Simon was serving in Afghanistan so I had to break the news to him over the phone and then deal with it on my own. ‘Over time, we were told there was an 85 per cent chance of her being healthy so our world fell apart when we had the diagnosis. ‘We have to take each day as it comes, although it is very difficult. Jess is absolutely beautiful.’ When she was born, doctors told Jess’ parents she would not live long as children suffering from the condition don’t survive for very long. Jess (pictured with her mother, Melanie) requires round-the-clock care to keep her alive. Her parents say they frequently have to give her the kiss of life when she stops breathing . Patau’s syndrome causes such serious problems that most affected babies are lost during pregnancy. Of those that survive birth, most only live for a few days. It is thought to be the most severe chromosomal abnormality. Jess has three copies of chromosome 13 in every cell, instead of two, and the result is that she forgets to breathe and turns blue. When she was born, doctors told Jess' parents she would not live long as children suffering from the condition don't usually survive for more than a few days . Jess has defied the odds and reached her first birthday. Mrs Kerr said: 'Her birthday is an extra special day and we are very excited' But she has defied the odds and reached her first birthday. Mrs Kerr, 38, who has five other children, said: ‘Her birthday is an extra special day and we are very excited. ‘We’re taking her to a play centre with friends and on Sunday we are having a big family party.’ Mrs Kerr discovered her baby might have problems at a 14-week scan but was encouraged by doctors who thought Jess may not suffer any health issues. Unfortunately it wasn’t until her birth that specialists could diagnose her condition. The family will be hosting a special fancy dress celebration for Jess in hope of raising money to help fund future activities for her. Patau syndrome, or trisomy 13, is a chromosomal abnormality caused by an extra copy of chromosome 13 in every cell. The condition causes multiple congenital abnormalities which result in severe physical and mental impairment. It occurs in between one in 5,000 and one in 29,000 live births and is the third most common autosomal trisomy in newborns. A couple are more at risk of having a child with the condition if they have a family history of the condition, risk also rises with maternal age. Many babies with Patau syndrome are stillborn or die within the first few days after being born - the life expectancy of affected babies is just 2.5 days. About 50 per cent of babies survive for longer than a week and only five to ten per cent survive for longer than a year.Features of the condition include, low birth weight, heart defects, facial defects, severe learning difficulties, problems controlling breathing, deafness, hernias, polycystic kidneys and abnormal hands and feet.","Jess Kerr, one, has Patau syndrome which causes her to stop breathing .

"Britain is preparing to send around 40 military personnel to Mali to help forces fighting with the French against Islamist insurgents. Although ministers have stressed British troops will not have a ‘combat role’, the offer goes much further than the air assistance first offered by David Cameron to France. Contingency plans have been drawn up to send the group – which is likely to include members of the special forces – in a European Union initiative to stop Al Qaeda taking hold of the region. A French-led offensive in January 2013 (above) drove out Islamist militants who seized control of northern Mali . Heavy machinery: A French military armoured vehicle is unloaded from a British  C17, plane after it landed at Bamako airport, Mali. British commanders plan to warn David Cameron against stepping up support for French . Airbourne: A French Rafale fighter jet takes off N'djamena as part of the 'Serval' operation in Mali . The move came as soldiers in Paris patrolled the Metro, railway stations and tourist attractions such as the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre. Mali rebels declared France had ‘opened the gates of hell’ with its assault and have threatened to attack French targets. France deployed hundreds of troops to Mali on Friday and began a ferocious aerial bombardment of rebel-held areas after its  president Dioncounda Traoré requested assistance. The British advisers and trainers would help train Malian soldiers and troops from other West African countries. It is understood that some would be based in Mali, while others would work in neighbouring countries such as Ghana, where Britain already has a team. The mission was described as a ‘small-scale training role if and when ministers ask for it’, and Africa minister Mark Simmonds repeated yesterday there would be no combat role. However, he said that the crisis was of ‘grave concern’ to Britain because of fears that Mali’s rebel-held north could become a ‘springboard for extremism’. The UK already has a detachment of around ten military personnel overseeing air support in the capital Bamako. One British official said: ‘This requirement is to supply advisers, not fighting troops on the ground. This is all about influence. Our people can help enhance their tactics and advise them on ways in which to control and win the battle space.’ Assault force: France has admitted that it is coming up against far better rebel resistance than feared in its former colony . Touchdown: A French armoured vehicle disembarks from the plane in Bamako last night. A total of 13 nations have agreed to either send troops, or else supplies and logistical help to aid the effort in Mali . Attack: Rafale fighter planes struck bases used by Al-Qaeda-linked fighters in Gao, the main city in northern Mali and the base from which ethnic-Tuareg rebels launched the offensive a year ago that touched off Mali's descent into chaos . The EU is drawing up plans to send a 150-strong training team to Mali, protected by a security force of 250. In London, however, Parliament’s European scrutiny committee has demanded reassurances that the Mali deployment will not ‘morph into something long term and become bogged down...or lead to a peacekeeping mission’. Former cabinet minister Peter Hain has warned of the dangers of so-called ‘mission creep’ and being dragged into a ‘long, drawn-out and difficult morass’. Two RAF C-17 Globemaster aircraft have been deployed to transport French military vehicles, troops and supplies to its former colony. Operation: French soldiers from 1st Regiment Cavalry unit unload an ERC 90 Sagaie armored all terrain vehicle on the tarmac of the military airbase in Bamako .

Loaded: Members of the RAF load French military equipment in the cargo hold of a Royal Air Force C-17 transport aircraft, left and right, before flying into Mali . Battle plans: French soldiers during a briefing before flying into Mali. Already last night, French forces led an all-night bombing campaign to wrest control from armed Islamist extremists of a small town . As French troops pressed north . yesterday, warplanes led an all-night bombing campaign in an effort to . dislodge the Islamist extremists who had seized the area, including a . strategic military camp. Meanwhile, a convoy of up to 50 . trucks carrying French troops crossed into Mali from Ivory Coast as . France prepares for a possible land assault. It already has at least 800 troops in .

"Emani Moss, 10, pictured here as a toddler, weighed just 32lbs when her remains were removed from a garbage bin outside an apartment complex in an Atlanta suburb last year . The father and stepmother of a ten-year-old girl who was found starved to death and burned in a trash can have pleaded not guilty to her murder. Emani Moss weighed just 32lbs when her remains were removed from a garbage bin outside an apartment complex in an Atlanta suburb last year. The girl's father, Eman Moss, and step-mother Tiffany Moss were charged with murder, concealing a body and child cruelty. Police alleged the couple starved to death the child before setting her body on fire to cover up the crime. The couple entered not guilty pleas after hearing the official charges against them when they appeared in court on Friday, WSB-TV Atlanta has reported. An investigator told the court the couple felt they needed to get rid of the body 'to keep the family together,' according to the Gwinnett Daily Post. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for the two accused, which could cause the case to move more slowly. In November last year it was reported that Detective Collin Flynn said that Eman Moss had initially told police that Emani died after swallowing some chemicals. The man later changed his story, accusing his wife of poisoning the 10-year-old. Eman Moss eventually admitted that he returned home from work on October 24 to find Emani lying in the bathtub and unable to move. Neither he nor Tiffany Moss, however, sought medical attention for the girl because they were afraid they would get in trouble with the law, Flynn said. Scroll down for video . The girl's father, Eman Moss, and step-mother Tiffany Moss were charged with murder, concealing a body and child cruelty. The couple pleaded not guilty when they appeared in court on Friday . According to a report from Georgia’s child services agency, Eman Moss bought a trash can and tried to incinerate his daughter's body in it. When the girl's remains would not burn, he took Emani back home and called police on November 2. It had earlier emerged that Georgia's child protection agency had dismissed a report that Emani Moss had been beaten with a belt. The Division of Family and Children Services did not send caseworkers to interview the girl, examine her injuries or question her parents. Agency officials concluded the beatings were corporal punishment and ended the case despite four prior maltreatment investigations involving the child. The agency first made contact with the Moss family in 2003 when Emani was only one year old, the station 11Alive reported. Caseworkers were told that the baby was not being properly cared for and denied food, but the officials ruled the allegations 'unsubstantiated' and closed the matter. Following her death, it emerged that Georgia's child protection agency had dismissed a report that Emani Moss had been beaten with a belt . Two years later, in April 2005, the agency investigated claims that the 3-year-old girl was suffering emotional and psychological neglect, but these allegations were also dismissed as ‘unsubstantiated.' In December 2008, the DFCS got a tip asking to look into claims of inadequate medical care and possible sexual abuse. Caseworks met with the child in private and concluded that 'no concerns were noted' about her. In March 2010, the child services agency confirmed that Emani had been whipped with a belt for failing to finish her schoolwork or get good grades.

Emani's parents were ordered to take parenting classes and go through an anger management course. Three months later, the child was returned to the home and the case was closed six months after that. Last May, officials at Emani's grade school reported seeing welts on her back and marks on her head, which were determined to be the results of corporal punishment. The last contact between DFCS and the Moss family came three months before Emani's death, when the agency got an anonymous tip that Emani appeared 'distant and afraid to interact’ with others.

"His face contorted in pain, this is the end of the road for one migrant’s desperate bid to reach Britain. The picture shows the extreme lengths young men and women living in squalid camps in the port of Calais will go to for a new life in the UK. The migrant had managed to sneak on to a lorry after heavy traffic caused queues on the approach road to the Channel Tunnel. When he tried to hide he accidentally wedging himself between the cargo of paper bales and the trailer wall, injuring himself in the process. Police were alerted after the lorry driver heard his cries of pain. Scroll down for video .

Meanwhile French authorities were forced to call in mediators yesterday following two days of violent clashes between rival migrant groups. And the town’s deputy mayor raised fears of a descent into lawlessness as police lose control of the desperate gangs. Philippe Mignonet also warned the number of migrants in the small port area were expected to swell to 5,000 in the coming weeks. Calais has been under siege for the past few days as rival ethnic groups battle each other for access to lorries at the ferry port. Mr Mignonet claimed his town had been ‘sacrificed’ by the British and French governments and Europe. Left, the lorry he was caught in.

Most of the migrants are good people, but there are a few bad people who are committing crimes.’ Aid workers say up to 2,000 migrants are currently camped in Calais but Mr Mignonet predicts this could swell to 5,000 before winter sets in. Tensions have risen in recent weeks as growing numbers of migrants are forced to compete for access to coveted sites where they try and jump onto lorries heading for Britain. Earlier this week riot police used tear gas on 400 illegal migrants who tried to storm lorries heading for Britain in a seemingly co-ordinated attack.

A Wilshire Baptist Church spokesman today confirmed that they were supporting the move financially and had been providing meals for the family. The location was chosen by Mayor Mike Rawlings and Mr Jenkins. According to Pastor Mason, ‘Louise is doing better since being moved to another house. That is giving her a sense of relief but she is eager for this to be over.’ This is the second tragedy to befall Ms Troh who is regarded as the matriarch of her large family, Pastor Mason revealed. Earlier this year one her three adult daughters died in childbirth in Liberia at the age of 38. Two daughters remained in Liberia when Ms Troh moved to the US more than a decade ago after a ‘falling out’ with Mr Duncan by whom she has a 19-year-old son, currently a student in Texas. Ms Troh’s other adult daughter, Youngor Jallah, 35, lives in Dallas and is in quarantine along with her four children ages 2 to 11 having tended to Mr Duncan and traveled with him to hospital last Sunday. Her husband Aaron Yah, 43, was last week told by CDC officials that he could return to work as a nursing assistant.’ According to Pastor Mason, Mr Troh visited Monrovia earlier this year and, ‘reconnected with Eric.’ He explained, ‘Their relationship never led to marriage in Liberia, but in recent times she had returned to Monrovia and they had reconnected and he was eager to come to the States.’ After so many years living in the US, Ms Troh is a naturalized citizen, Pastor Mason said. Mr Duncan entered the country on a tourist visa but his forthcoming marriage could have sped the process for his own naturalization or green card if he chose to apply. Pastor Mason said, ‘He had applied for a visa and it had taken quite a while to come through so he was excited when actually he got the visa and was planning to come here and visit with me about having a wedding and starting a new life. He was looking forward to seeing the woman he loved and reconnect with his son.’ He added, ‘I think it’s important to know that chronology. This was not a quick decision to leave Liberia upon a sense of his having been exposed.’ Just how ‘eager’ Mr Duncan was to come to America – and remain here – has been a subject of intense scrutiny and controversy across the past week. Duncan was eager to come to the US so he could marry Ms Troh, with him he has a 19-year-old son . Pastor Mason said the Wiltshire congregation is supporting Ms Troh in her quarantine and have secured the home she is currently staying in with her children . Liberian authorities have now claimed that he lied on exit documents, answering ‘No’ to specific questions regarding whether or not he had been in contact with or involved in the treatment of someone infected with the Ebola virus. Pastor Mason said that he had addressed this revelation with members of his church. He said, ‘If he did lie he will be held accountable and it's not up to us to stand in the way of that process. ‘But he hasn’t had a chance to give his own account and let’s be honest, Liberia has good reason to not want to appear to have messed up here.’ The day before he had been due to leave Liberia, Mr Duncan carried a pregnant Ebola sufferer to her home where she later died. Addressing the anger this revelation has prompted, Pastor Mason said, ‘Let’s be honest. He had just been holding this pregnant young woman in his arms and taken her home because she could not get care in Liberia and watched her die. ‘And even if he knew he was exposed, that is – if he were to stay – what he would know would be the outcome very soon for him. ‘If he came to America with the best health care system in the world and acknowledgement worldwide that we have had aid workers who had contracted this and who have recovered he would know he stood a chance. ‘I don’t excuse him if he did intentionally conceal that information. But it’s certainly understandable that he might have.’ However ‘understandable’ Mr Duncan’s motivations , the recklessness of his alleged lie in order to secure his transit to the States has now put the lives of all who came into direct contact with him in danger, as well as countless others’ should the Communicative Diseases Center fail to contain the virus. Yesterday their assertion that the situation was under control was dealt a severe blow with CDC’s admission that they had ‘lost’ the homeless man who had travelled in the ambulance in which Mr Duncan had been vomiting violently. But, for now, Pastor Mason said his focus, and that of his church was on providing what support they can for Ms Troh as her fiancés condition worsens. He said, ‘We have assured her that until the end of this period of 21 days that she has to endure, regardless of the outcome of Eric’s illness, positive or negative, we’ll walk beside her and help her to rebuild her life as much as possible.’","Louise Troh is a naturalized U.S. citizen who has a 19-year-old son with Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan, her pastor reveals .

"Fears of another Sangatte were triggered yesterday when the French government announced plans for a new centre for migrants in Calais. Intended as a ‘humanitarian response’ to the growing number of people living rough in the area, the centre will offer mainly medical facilities. But residents warned that migrants would flock to the proposed facility. Scroll down for video . A day centre, normally used as a summer school (pictured)  is the proposed site of a centre for migrants in Calais . French authorities will offer medical and legal advice to thousands of migrants seeking asylum in the UK at the centre if it is opened . With the authorities promising legal advice for those seeking asylum in Britain, even the deputy mayor of Calais admitted it could serve as a hotspot for those seeking to cross the Channel. Sangatte was a controversial Red Cross centre located just outside the port that acted as a magnet for thousands of migrants before it was closed following riots in 2002. Official figures now put the number of migrants in Calais at 2,300 – up from 1,500 in August. Violent clashes between rival migrant gangs competing for the best locations to board lorries are an almost daily occurrence. Announcing the new centre yesterday, France’s interior minister said he wanted to stop illegal camping in Calais and house asylum seekers throughout the country. Bernard Cazeneuve also said migrants wanting to apply for asylum in Britain would be offered legal advice to help them with their applications. But he insisted these measures would not encourage more migrants to arrive in Calais, as happened with Sangatte. The facility will be housed in a leisure centre – a summer school for children – with kitchens capable of catering for up to 500 people. There is also heating, toilets and showers. French police used tear gas on crowds of migrants this week in Calais when around 300 attempted to storm lorries heading for the Channel . The mayor of Calais said last week she could close the port if the situation was not improved soon . Thousands of migrants have set up camp in the port town in recent months in the hope of gaining access to the UK . There are beds at the centre, but Mr Cazeneuve said only the most vulnerable, including mothers with children, would be allowed to use them. Mr Cazeneuve backed the centre ‘with one condition – that the operating rules are clear and everyone demonstrates responsibility for the security of the site, and that it is protected from savage behaviour. ‘We will make sure that the building of illegal camps is stopped’. Philippe Mignonet, the deputy mayor of Calais, said the centre could be a new Sangatte. ‘Some are saying that it will and we can’t do anything because Calais is already a magnet,’ he said. ‘Well, Calais is not. England is. ‘It was the same problem with Sangatte at the beginning. It was working well but it’s the number of migrants which causes problems, not the migrants themselves. ‘It could become a problem again at the new centre: I am not saying it will, but it could.’ He said that housing migrants in centres around France would not work as they would go straight back to the Calais camp. ‘When a camp is dismantled and migrants are sent to different parts of the country and told that they can claim asylum in France, they are back in Calais within a week,’ he added. Critics fear the centre could have a similar effect to one opened in 2002 which attracted hordes of Afghan and Kurdish migrants who had to be controlled by police after breaking out into riots (pictured) The creation of Sangatte in 2002 brought on a period of sustained violence in the port town with. Kurdish migrants break down the fence at one refugee camp (pictured) Mr Cazeneuve also announced that more police would be drafted in, saying that security was his number one priority. ‘People from Calais have the right to peace,’ he said. ‘My first task is to assure their safety. So from today there will be a total of 450 police and gendarmes mobilised in Calais, which is exceptional for a district of 75,000 inhabitants, but totally justified given the situation.’ Britain has given £12million to the French to enhance security measures as clashes between migrants have grown more violent and their attempts to reach Britain more desperate. Denis Robin, prefect of the Pas-de-Calais region, said there had been a marked rise in crime linked to the migrants. He did not give a date for the opening of the centre.","A centre will be opened to deal with swelling numbers of migrants at port .

"A software tycoon has accused his wife of being a ‘psychopath’ while she has called him ‘cruel, spiteful and wicked’ in an extraordinarily bitter £5million divorce battle. Anthony Colborne, 53, claims their three teenage children have not asked to see their mother, Lynda, 60, since the split and argues that he should keep their £1.6million six-bedroom home. But the entrepreneur is accused of conducting his financial affairs ‘with arrogant contempt’ for his estranged wife and the court, as well as hiding his assets. Dispute: Anthony Colborne (left) claims their three teenage children have not asked to see their mother, Lynda (right), 60, after the split . Mrs Colborne’s barrister Nicholas Starks has alleged that Mr Colborne sold off foreign investments without consulting her and hid assets worth £800,000 out of a £5million-plus pot. ‘In short, the husband is a law unto himself … [and] does not consider the wife to have made any contribution to the marriage worthy of recognition,’ said Mr Starks. The case has reached the Court of Appeal after a judge ruled earlier this year that the wife should keep their house in leafy Wargrave in Berkshire, as well as £16,000 and all of her husband’s pension. Appealing, Mr Colborne claims this is not fair as he is bringing up their three children, including 16-year-old twin girls, since they separated. ‘The children expressed great relief at not having [Mrs Colborne] in the family home with all the turmoil [she] brought,’ he said in a court statement. ‘The children have subsequently taken very little interest in their mother and have never asked to visit their mother.’ And his barrister, Simon Calhaem, said: ‘It was not appropriate for the judge simply to ignore the fact that the children live with their father and do not see their mother. ‘To do so was to fail to address properly or at all how they will be housed or clothed and fed, and have their school fees met.’ Mr Colborne says he should keep the £1.6million six-bedroom family home on this road in Wargrave, Berkshire . Hearing: The case reached the Court of Appeal (pictured) in London after a judge earlier this year ruled that the wife should get their house in Wargrave, £16,000 and all her husband’s pension . The court heard the couple married in 1995, separated in 2011 and divorced earlier this year. In 2007, Mr Colborne sold his £5million share in the flourishing software company he set up a decade earlier and says he has not worked since. He claims that he has a loss-making coffee shop in Wargrave, and investments in Morocco which have not yet paid off. But Mrs Colborne has accused him of hiding assets, including proceeds of the sale of two flats in north Africa. She said that while she was stuck in rented accommodation and living off the generosity of friends, he could still enjoy their previous lifestyle. Mr Starks said Mr Colborne had engaged in ‘spiteful and wicked’ denigration of his ex-wife. That included his repeated ‘psychopath’ remarks in a court statement. Mr Colborne failed to provide requested information about money and would ‘stop at nothing’ to get what he wants, the barrister added. As the case stands, with Mr Colborne keeping the Moroccan assets, his share would be worth about £3million, Mr Starks claimed. He said it would be ‘manifestly unfair’ to Mrs Colborne, and not in the children’s interests, if she were left as the ‘poor relation’. Mr Colborne denies hiding any of the couple’s assets, claiming that the money was used for school fees, mortgage payments, overdrafts and other joint responsibilities. He says his ex-wife was handed all of their UK and liquid wealth, while he was left with ‘illiquid and speculative’ assets in the form of incomplete Moroccan property developments. He disputes the value of the assets he retains. The Court of Appeal will rule on the case at a later date.","Anthony Colborne, 53, claims three children have not asked to see mother .

"Britain has triumphed in the battle of the rosbifs after a French celebrity butcher declared its steaks the best in the world. Grass-fed British cattle has long been regarded as a cut above that produced by other nations, but now the leaders in the world of gastronomy have declared it the winner. France’s most famous butcher, Yves-Marie le Bourdonnec, also declares that the only way to save French cows is for them to sleep with the enemy and breed with British cows. France’s most famous butcher, Yves-Marie le Bourdonnec (pictured) has angered his fellow countrymen by claiming British beef steaks are better than French . ‘We have lost the notion in France of what a good steak is In fact, we simply don’t know what it is any more,’ he said. ‘The best rearers in the world are the British.’ But his remarks have not gone down well in the country that considers itself to be the world capital of gastronomic genius. Le Bourdonnec has been expelled by the French butchers’ federation, who released a statement saying it was ‘amazed at the media exposure given to a figure who has distinguished himself as a detractor of French rearers and is a paid-up supporter of British farmers.’ In a feature-length documentary, Steak (R)evolution, Le Bourdonnec travels the world from the Pampas of Argentina to the Kobe ranches of Japan in search of the world’s perfect sirloin. The butcher is notorious in France for refusing to sell to Michelin-starred chefs and instead reserving his finest cuts for ordinary Parisians at his four shops in and around the city. He previously outraged French culinary connoisseurs when he co-founded a Parisian steak house called The Beef Club serving only British cuts. In the documentary, he argues that France’s three main breeds of cattle - Blondes d’Aquitaine, Limousins and Charolaises - are tough ‘athletic’ animals bred for work and milking but not for meat. Le Bourdonnec said British breeds like the Aberdeen Angus (pictured), Galloway, Hereford and Longhorn, when grass-fed make the perfect steak due to a marbling effect which produces tender and flavoursome beef . But the British breeds Aberdeen Angus, Galloway, Hereford and Longhorn, when grass-fed, make the perfect steak due to the marbling effect which produces tender and flavoursome beef. ‘We’ve only really been eating grilled meat in France for the past 30 years, whereas you rosbifs we been doing so since the 16th century and have bred cows for that very purpose, so it’s only natural you have had a head start,’ the film’s producer Franck-Ribiere told The Sunday Telegraph. ‘Our breeds are fine for stews, boeuf bourguignon and pot au feu as they have a lot of collagen, which is good for boiling, but a little fat. A good English roast beef can be eaten alone - you add nothing.’ He is also calling for the French to crossbreed their cows to improve the quality of the country’s beef. ‘This is precisely what we did in wine: we privileged terroir - local soil - over grape variety. Today we have many grape varieties in one area,’ he added. Emmaunel Rubin, a food critic and co-founder of Le Fooding, a popular restaurant guide, said that he thought people should eat less meat and favour grass-fed - the film’s main message. But he said he was ‘wary of Robespierre figures’ such as Le Bourdonnec, because the French were used to their national style of beef. ‘A Frenchman against the French in the name of meat? That’s like Asterix against the Gauls. In French we say you should be brave, but not foolhardy.","Views of famous butcher Yves-Marie le Bourdonnec not gone down well .

"On the run: Mounir Jaouane, the sixth prisoner to abscond from HMP Hatfield in as many weeks, was jailed in 2007 for robbery . A violent robber has absconded from an open prison - the sixth inmate at the same facility to do so in six months. Mounir Jaouane, 22, failed to return to HMP Hatfield in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, at around 3pm yesterday. The criminal, who was given an indeterminate sentence in January 2007, had been released on temporary licence from the open prison to his former home in Sheffield. Five other men have fled HMP Hatfield since May - and only three are back behind bars after being rearrested. Pressure is already growing on the Government to explain the recent rash of escapes from the category D open resettlement prison. On Sunday, Damian Pearson, sentenced to three-and-a-half years in jail for burglary in 2013, escaped. The 24-year-old is said to have links to the local area. Burglar Darrell Roy Burbeary, 43, from Sheffield, escaped on June 15 - he is still on the run despite writing a taunting letter to his local paper claiming police had made a mistake with the appeal. Richard Brown, 27, who was in jail for aggravated burglary, fled on June 10 but was rearrested in Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire. Thief Dean Jackson, 27, escaped on May 21 but was rearrested in Newcastle, while knifepoint-robber Damien Burns, 39, fled on May 19, and was rearrested in Scarborough. Caroline Flint, Labour MP for Don Valley, met with Prison Minister Jeremy Wright for a second time on Tuesday seeking answers about the series of escapes. Mrs Flint said: 'Residents are understandably concerned and I have made clear to the Minister that public safety has to be his number one priority. 'I held an urgent meeting with the Prison Minister, Jeremy Wright, the second in a week, to ask that every prisoner be risk assessed for potential flight to reduce the chance of absconding. 'I also want to know whether the prison has warned every prisoner that they will face a longer jail sentence in a closed prison if they abscond.' Damian Pearson (left), sentenced to three-and-a-half years in jail for burglary in 2013, escaped on Sunday. Burglar Darrell Roy Burbeary (right), 43, from Sheffield, escaped on June 15 . The MP has arranged a meeting with Hatfield’s governor to discuss the escapes. Joe Simpson, of the Prison Officers Association, said many prisoners were absconding because prisons were overcrowded and understaffed. Mr Simpson said the wrong type of prisoner was increasingly being sent to open prisons because the UK prison population was growing. He said: 'They’re also cutting staff - Hatfield is currently five staff lower than it should be.' Thief Dean Jackson, 27, escaped on May 21 but was rearrested in . Newcastle . Knifepoint-robber Damien Burns, 39, fled on May 19, and was rearrested in Scarborough . Richard Brown, 27, who was in jail for aggravated burglary, fled on June 10 but was rearrested . It is not just HMP Hatfield that prisoners are disappearing from. Darren . Douglas, 46, and Ricardo Dunn, 32,  absconded from Spring Hill open . prison in Buckinghamshire, in the early hours of Sunday. Douglas . is serving a life sentence for a murder he committed in Birmingham in . 1998 where he stabbed a man to death outside a pub. Described . during his trial as a 'man with a very short fuse', he confronted his . victim in a toilet and accused him of being 'queer' before forcing him . outside for a fight. He then pulled a knife from his pocket and stabbed him seven times, including at least twice through the heart. On . the run: Murderer Darren Douglas, 46, left, and violent criminal . Ricardo Dunn, right, have absconded from Spring Hill open prison in Buckinghamshire . Douglas, who police say should not be approached, had already been jailed 'frequently' for burglary and other violent offences before the murder. Dunn is serving an indeterminate sentence following a conviction for GBH with intent in Burnley. He assaulted a man following a row in the street in 2009. Chief inspector Olly Wright, of Thames Valley Police, said: 'We are keen to speak to anyone who may have seen these men in the area and can provide us with information about their movements. 'These men were both convicted for violent offences and I would advise anyone who sees them, to not approach them and call police immediately. 'Both men have links with other areas so may have travelled out of the Thames Valley to those areas. I would like to remind people that it is a criminal offence to harbour these men and anyone caught doing so would be arrested.' The issue of prisoners walking out of open prisons has been in the spotlight since 'Skullcracker' Michael Wheatley went on the run earlier this year. High profile: Habitual absconder, the Skullcracker Michael Wheatley, went on the run in May and was already serving 13 life sentences . Callous: Wheatley even robbed a bank while on the run and was well known for pistol-whipping victims and was described in court as a 'career' criminal. In May, the 55-year-old sparked a nationwide manhunt after he absconded from Category D jail HMP Standford Hill on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent. The prolific armed robber - dubbed the 'Skullcracker' for pistol-whipping innocent bystanders during raids - went on to rob a building society in Surrey. He was already serving 13 life sentences for a string of raids when he disappeared, sparking a political row over the day release of dangerous criminals. After being caught, he was sentenced at Guildford Crown Court to life behind bars and told he will serve at least 10 years before being eligible for parole. It has also emerged that two prisoners, Scott Callaghan, 35, and Billy Harkins, 29, disappeared from the same prison on Saturday. Callaghan is serving a sentence for perverting the course of justice and Harkins for aggravated burglary, Kent Police said. Last month Sussex Police revealed that 89 prisoners had gone missing since the 1970s from Ford open prison and are still unaccounted for.","Mounir Jaouane, 22, failed to return to HMP Hatfield yesterday .

"Texas Attorney General and the GOP's candidate for governor in the Lone State Greg Abbott is getting knocked around today for declining to tell a local newspaper whether he would have defended a ban on interracial marriage if he were the state's lawyer when it was being challenged. Asked about the outdated law by the San Antonio Express-News editorial board as part of an endorsement interview, Abbott said: 'Right now, if there was a ban on interracial marriage, that's already been ruled unconstitutional. 'And all I can do is deal with the issues that are before me ... The job of an attorney general is to represent and defend in court the laws of their client, which is the state Legislature, unless and until a court strikes it down.' He later argued that state government 'would be a dictatorship' by attorney generals if they were able to choose which laws to defend based on their personal preferences. Republican gubernatorial nominee and Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott waves to supporters at a rally last week. Abbott is under fire today for comments he made during an editorial board interview about interracial marriage . Abbott, left, wouldn't say today whether he would defended an interracial marriage ban if he'd been the state's lawyer at the time. Progressives attacked the non-answer today and characterized him as racist, even though his wife Cecilia, is Hispanic. They are pictured here at a 2012 event in Texas . A member of the Express News' editorial board explained in a write up of the interview that she gave him Abbott a chance to clarify his answer, and Abbott said, 'Actually, the reason why you’re uncertain about it is because I didn’t answer the question. And I can’t go back and answer some hypothetical question like that.' Abbott intended to make the point that it would not be appropriate for him to 'dictate policy' as AG. That's the role of lawmakers. Something he went on to explain to the Express-News in detail. But that's not how the discussion is playing out, particularly in progressive circles, even though Abbott's wife, Cecilia, is Hispanic. If Greg Abbott is elected in November, as widely expected, Cecilia Abbott will become the state's first Latina first lady. Recent polls have Abbott leading his Democratic opponent in the race, state senator Wendy Davis, by more than 10 points, and the GOP official's comments today on interracial marriage are unlikely to change that. Still, Democrats in the state holding out hope for a victory in 15 days, and they attacked Abbott's nuanced response to the interracial marriage question today as being both vague and tinged with racism. Texas Progress, a non-profit that specializes in rapid response communications against Republicans in the state, posted the first portion of the interview and blasted Abbott for refusing to answer the question. 'Wrong, Greg Abbott. You can and should answer a question like that. The answer Texans deserve to hear from a man that is running to be their Governor is a definitive: “No, I would not."" ' The progressive organization said Abbott's answer shows 'just how out-of-touch and backwards' he is. It also hit him for advocating on behalf of the state's contentious voter identification law. Democratic gubernatorial Democratic candidate Wendy Davis talks to supporters before casting her vote on the first day of early voting today at the Charles Griffin Sub-Courthouse, in Fort Worth, Texas. Davis said on Monday that Abbott's refusal to say whether he would have defended a law banning interracial marriage is 'troubling' Davis also linked Abbott's position on interracial marriage to his support for the state's voter ID law . The U.S. Supreme Court said Saturday that it would allow the statute to go into effect ahead of November's election, despite pleas from U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to block it. Abbott's office praised the Supreme Court's decision last weekend in a statement. 'We are pleased that the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed that Texas' voter ID law should remain in effect for the upcoming election,' a spokeswoman for the Texas AG's office, Lauren Bean, said. 'The state will continue to defend the voter ID law and remains confident that the district court's misguided ruling will be overturned on the merits. The U.S. Supreme Court has already ruled that voter ID laws are a legal and sensible way to protect the integrity of elections.' Democrats believe that the laws purposefully disenfranchise black voters. In discussing Abbott's interracial marriage conundrum today, Texas Progress accused him of defending a statute that 'intentionally discriminated against African American and Hispanics.' Davis also linked his position on the interracial marriage ban to his support for the state's voter ID law. 'Greg Abbott won't say whether he'd defend an interracial marriage ban—troubling but not surprising from someone who defends a ""poll tax,"" ' Davis tweeted. Abbott, left, speaks to a group of supporters on Tuesday, Oct. 14, 2014, in Houston, Texas. Abbott has been wheelchair bound since a tree fell on him in 1984. He sued the property owner and won millions. Davis has made the incident an issue in the gubernatorial race . Abbott was asked if he would advocate on behalf of an interracial marriage ban by the Express-News after a Republican attorney general candidate in Wisconsin said recently that he would have defended the law if he were the state's lawyer even though 'it might be distasteful to me.' 'I've got to stay consistent with that — as the state's lawyer, it's not my job to pick and choose' which laws to uphold, the candidate, Brad Schimel, said. Seeking to avoid the same media firestorm that followed Schimel's response, Abbott opted not to answer the hypothetical question when it was posed to him by the Express-News. He did, however, give a similar explanation for why he would advocate on behalf of the state for a law even if he didn't agree with it. 'What kind of state would we live in if the public policies of this state were allowed to be determined by the attorney general?' Abbott said. 'The attorney general would have a super veto over the elected representatives, and that would be a chaotic form of government, contrary to our fundamental constitutional principles. It would be way beyond the separation of powers. It would be a dictatorship... by the attorney general.' Abbott said he 'would love it' if the state's attorney had broad authority to set statewide policies. 'The state would look a whole lot more like me right now if I did abandon my role and exercised my magic wand and decided what cases I would defend and which I didn't, and therefore allowed me to dictate policy in this state,' he said. 'But I think that by doing what I do, I am maintaining the policy that I think is appropriate, and that is for each elected official to fulfill their constitutional obligations,' Abbott added. The Texas gubernatorial race has had no shortage of drama in the last several weeks, even before Abbott's comments today and the Supreme Court's mandate over the weekend. Davis, whose claim to fame is an abortion rights filibuster she held on the state senate floor last year, has accused wheelchair-bound Abbott of denying other victims the same justice he received after he was injured while jogging more than three decades ago. After a tree fell on Abbott he successfully sued the property owner and won millions. Davis noted his disability in an ad, featuring video of an empty wheel chair, and tried to shame him for litigating cases against other paraplegics and survivors of accidents and crimes. The ad was roundly criticized in the media as too harsh but the Democrat has refused to back down from her claims or yank the commercial.","Abbott argued that 'the job of an attorney general is to represent and defend in court the laws of their client, which is the state Legislature'

"TV producer Tim Robinson who is suing Marks and Spencer after wrongly being accused of shoplifting from one of their stores . A former BBC TV producer is to sue Marks and Spencer for £100,000 after he was wrongly accused of shoplifting and marched through one of their stores in handcuffs. Award winning Tim Robinson, 51, who has worked on programmes such as Timewatch and Digging for Britain, was then locked in a police cell for six hours as police investigated claims he had stolen pork chops. Now the Oxford graduate, who was released without charge, is claiming compensation of £100,000 for false imprisonment, defamation, emotional distress and mental suffering. He is also claiming back all the money he believes he spent at the store close to his home over the past 13 years, together with £20,000 in interest. Private security guards approached Mr Robinson as he shopped at the Camden Town branch of Marks and Spencer in North London in May. He was then taken to the stairwell in front of neighbours where he claims two 'threatening and rude' security staff accused him of stealing £60 worth of peppered steak and a barrel of pork over two weeks previously. They then called the police and allegedly claimed Mr Robinson was being 'physically threatening'. But it was only when police compared his photo from security cameras with the meat thief that they spotted the blunder. Mr Robinson today said: 'I feel appalled at how I was treated. I was just wandering through the shop - it's very close to my house. A security guard came up to me and said could he have have a word with me. 'He showed me a still of myself and said is this you? He said to come to the back of the shop and we'll talk about it. His manner was threatening. 'They said I had stolen food from the shop. I said I had no idea what they were talking about. They had an array of stills with them but they only showed me two of myself taken on a different date. 'They had these stills of the criminal with different coloured hair and at least fifteen years younger. The only similarity is that we're both male, white and slim. It's unbelievable. What on earth were they doing putting photographs of me and mixing them up with photographs of a criminal?' He added: 'They didn't even have the decency to take me somewhere private. They said I would have time to look at the photographs later. They were very threatening and very rude. 'The first thing the policeman said was ""why did you tell me this is an emergency? He isn't physically threatening"". 'The police said I could have an interview there and then but I said I wasn't prepared to say anything until a solicitor was there. 'I was handcuffed and marched through the shop in front of everyone, in front of my neighbours. I was made to get into the police van on Camden High Street. 'I was put into the back of the police van with the grille, all my belongings taken. And then they took a mug shot.' Mr Robinson says he shopped in the Camden Town branch of Marks and Spencer for over 12 years and is also claiming back all of the money he claims he has spent at the store . Mr Robinson's partner, who is a City lawyer then turned up at the police station where he was told he had been identified as a shoplifter. He explained: 'I was really shocked, I actually burst into tears when I spoke to the duty solicitor. 'She said that the police told her they had incontrovertible evidence that I committed this crime. She was saying that it would be better to admit to the crime. I thought I was having some kind of memory lapse. I thought I was bonkers.' But he added he was only let go when officers re-examined the photos of him and the thief and realised they had the wrong man and said: 'The police didn't look carefully enough at the photographs. It clearly wasn't me. 'She apologised afterwards after it and said that she had never seen anything like this. 'The writ is composed of three main parts, defamation, false imprisonment, and basically an abuse of trust. 'I'm an Oxford graduate, I'm in a very fortunate position. Just imagine what could have happened to a person without these sorts of advantages. 'I'm just determined this doesn't happen to someone else. I want M&S to change the way they operate.' A spokeswoman for Marks and Spencer said: 'As this is part of ongoing legal proceedings, it would be inappropriate for M&S to provide any comment at this time.' A Camden Police spokesman confirmed they were called to the shop on May 19 after staff reported they had found believed responsible for thefts on May 2. The spokesman added : 'A 51-year-old man was taken to a north London police station where he was interviewed under caution. No further action was taken on the man.'","Tim Robinson was shopping in M&S when he was approached by security .

"It is hardly a secret weapon to strike fear into the heart of his opponent across the net. But this was the list of ten motivational tips that Andy Murray hoped would inspire him to victory. Some, including ‘Try your best’ which was second on the list, seemed to be a statement of the obvious for any sportsman, let alone a tennis player ranked No 4 in the world who has looked back to his best in recent weeks. Match points: The motivational hints for tennis star Andy Murray, scrawled on the back of a letter from fans . Likewise the exhortation to ‘Focus on each point’. Other tips were more straightforward, such as ‘Try to keep him at the baseline, make him move’ and ‘Stay low on passes, use your legs’. But the list also included such seemingly baffling instructions as ‘Be intense with your legs’, ‘Be good to yourself’ – the No 1 instruction – and ‘Be proactive during points’. And it is to be hoped that Murray won’t be including the sixth on the list, ‘Try to be the one dictating’, in his plans for when he marries girlfriend Kim Sears in April. Murray was photographed consulting the ten tips, which had been scrawled on the back of a letter of support from his fans, during his quarter-final at a tournament in the Netherlands last week. In need of a lift: Murray consults the note during his quarter-final at a tournament in the Netherlands last week . Unfortunately, they do not seem to have been much help for the British No 1, who was beaten in straight sets by lower-ranked French player Gilles Simon. Murray, pictured at Wimbledon last year, revealed that he has been working with a sports psychologist . The photograph of the instructions was taken by Dutch journalist Wilfred Genee, who obtained the note after the match. The scribblings provide an insight into the famously grumpy Scotsman’s mind and suggest he does try to think positively on court. It is unclear who was responsible for the instructions, as his coach Amelie Mauresmo did not accompany him to the ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament in Rotterdam. However, Murray revealed last month that he has been working with a sports psychologist, and the messages are all certainly positive and motivational. He has used sports psychologists in the past, although without too much conviction. ‘I don’t think counting to ten helps when you are playing in the semi-finals of a Grand Slam on Centre Court at Wimbledon against one of the best athletes in the world,’ he once said, scathingly. On another occasion he suggested that a sports psychologist ‘doesn’t know what it feels like or the best way to deal with things because they haven’t been there’. But now he appears to believe they can have an important part to play in his career. He revealed last month: ‘I think when it comes to psychology it has to be something that the player wants and the player buys into. ‘When it’s someone else’s suggestion, in the past I haven’t felt like it’s worked. But just now I think it’s working well.’ Murray, who lost to Novak Djokovic in the final of the Australian Open a fortnight ago, was pictured looking at the notes in his courtside chair during the match as he lost 6-4 6-2 to Simon – the first time he has been beaten by the Frenchman in 13 meetings. Couple: It is to be hoped that Murray won’t be including the sixth on the list, 'Try to be the one dictating', in his plans for when he marries girlfriend Kim Sears in April . The paper his instructions were written on – a letter from a group of his most ardent fans – also suggests the famously dour sportsman has a sensitive side. The letter read: ‘There are good days and bad days in tennis and we know how it feels when something going wrong way [sic], but you must stay strong, never give up and always believe in your dreams.’ It was signed @magicmurray fans. It also urged him to ‘avoid haters’, saying they were ‘always proud of you’ and added: ‘We all believe that you will be number 1 soon… You will be our number 1, always!’","Hints for tennis star included 'Try your best' and 'Focus on each point'

"A homeless dog received a makeover that saved his life after being taken to a kill shelter. Charlie the Shelter Dog was found earlier this year on the side of a Los Angeles road and taken to a high-kill shelter. The Inquisitr reports that most dogs who aren't adopted don't last more than a week in the shelters that euthanize more than half the dogs in their custody. Charlie's story would have come to a sad end, but a groomer from Hollywood Grooming, a pet grooming shop in Los Angeles, came to the rescue and gave Charlie the makeover that landed him in a new home. Scroll down for video . Found: Charlie the Shelter Dog received a drastic makeover after being found earlier this year on the side of a Los Angeles road and taken to a high-kill shelter . The groomer shaved off Charlie's matted, knotted fur that was riddled with painful burrs and gave the pup a much-needed bath. In a video posted by The Pet Collective, Charlie is seen on a grooming table shaking and looks to be terrified. Much of his fur is discolored and the pup's eyes are barely visible beneath the matted fur surrounding and burrs hanging from his face. In the end, Charlie is completely unrecognizable. His dark brown eyes are visible and the groomer completes his look by tying a brown, paw-printed bandana around the pup's neck. Adoption: Charlie would have met his end at a high-kill shelter that euthanizes more than 50 percent of the dogs in their custody, but he received a makeover that is believed to have led to his adoption . The Pet Collective reports that Charlie was adopted two days later. The touching video has received more than 8 million views on YouTube. Dogster reports that four other dogs were given makeovers that day, and all were adopted just days after the visit. 'Professional makeovers, whether for humans or dogs, are often dismissed as mere vanity or narcissism,' a blogger for Dogster wrote, 'but as Pet Collective videos show, they can be a very important part of caring for one's physical or mental health.'

"Daniel Bolger, who retired last year as a lieutenant-general, said ‘young riflemen paid the price’ for Sir Nick Carter’s (pictured) ‘risk averse’ mentality . A U.S. General has blamed the head of the British Army for the death of troops in Afghanistan saying he refused to carry out air strikes when they were asked for. Daniel Bolger, who retired last year as a lieutenant-general, said ‘young riflemen paid the price’ for General Sir Nick Carter’s ‘risk averse’ mentality and fear of causing civilian casualties. He said that while other generals went to the front line with their men, Sir Nick made only brief helicopter trips to safe positions and instead turned down requests for aircraft and artillery from the safety of his ‘large, well-appointed command post.’ The American claimed his British counterpart was a ‘peppy, pushy fellow’ and said: ‘He’s not the type of general I would put in charge of anything.’ The outspoken attack in his new book Why We Lost: A General’s Inside Account of the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars, highlights the tensions between senior U.S. and British officers over how to take on the Taliban. Bolger served alongside Sir Nick at Nato headquarters in Kabul and became exasperated by his strict interpretation of the policy of ‘courageous restraint’ which was meant to cut the number of civilian casualties. Under the policy, Nato troops were forbidden from firing unless they were fired upon and could identify their attackers and were warned destroying a home or property ‘creates more insurgents’. Bolger said: ‘In the First World War you had the chateau generals. Now we’ve got the digital chateau generals where they sit and get PowerPoint briefings and think that told them what the hell was going on.’ He claimed Sir Nick’s attitude was: ‘‘Oh, I don’t want to oversupervise my troops, I’ll give them all these rules to follow then let them sort it out on the ground’‘, but he added that ‘this is the same guy trying to direct where every single artillery round goes’. In his book, Bolger refers to a 2010 report by former US colonel Harry Tunnell which claimed Sir Nick showed a ‘gross lack of concern for subordinates’. He claimed Sir Nick gave a verbal order that any civilian casualties were unacceptable and ‘coalition soldiers may have to be killed rather than defend themselves’. U.S. General Daniel Bolger (pictured) has claimed his British counterpart was a ‘peppy, pushy fellow’ The criticism refers to the time when Sir Nick was the head of Nato’s Regional Command South in Afghanistan in 2009 and 2010. But British military officials defended Sir Nick, 55, who was appointed chief of the general staff in September. ‘UK forces have always worked closely with their US counterparts and the concept of courageous restraint was an International Security Assistance Force-led initiative which was in place across Afghanistan,’ a Ministry of Defence spokesman said. ‘In any operation, UK troops always have the inherent right to self-defence and accusations that troops were put in unnecessary danger are nonsensical.’ Lord Dannatt, a former head of the British Army, told the Sunday Times that the criticisms were ‘very unfair’. He said: ‘I hope he sells half a dozen copies and not many more than that.’","U.S. General Daniel Bolger blames British Army leader for death of troops .

"A mother and son are suing each other after she threw him out of the £1.2million family home and changed the locks. Elizabeth Ashley, 79, kicked her son out of the house two years ago and has not allowed him back, despite his insistence that he paid for most of it. Mitchim Ashley, 53, says he has a legal right to live in his childhood home – which has risen in price by a staggering £1million since they bought it – and is demanding he be allowed to return. Court fight: A mother and  son are suing each other after she barred him from her £1.2million home - despite Mitchim Ashley (left) paying in cash for three-quarters of the purchase price for his mother Elizabeth, 79 (right) The pair are now suing each other at Central London County Court over the property in Wandsworth, south-west London. Mr Ashley is demanding that his mother either allows him to return home or sells the house and halves the profits with him. Mrs Ashley is arguing that she has the right to decide who lives in her home and is seeking damages for alleged harassment by her estranged son. Yesterday, the court heard that the property had been the family home for nearly four decades before the row. Mrs Ashley had been renting the property but in 2001 she bought it jointly with her son for just £200,000. Mrs Ashley paid only £5,000, with her son, an electrician currently living in Hastings, East Sussex, contributing £150,000 in cash and acting as guarantor for a £45,000 mortgage in his mother’s name, the court heard. A deed of trust was drawn up between them at the time of the purchase, stating that they each owned half of the house. Bargain: The terraced home in Wansdworth, south west London, cost just £200,000 in 2001 . Joshua Swirsky, for Mr Ashley, said his client’s mother was being ‘unreasonable’. ‘The trigger for the litigation was Mrs Ashley’s decision to change the locks to the property when her son said he wanted to spend more time there,’ he said. ‘The purpose of the trust was to provide a home for Mr Ashley, as well as Mrs Ashley, and he indeed occupied the property between 2001 and his exclusion in 2012.’ Criticising Mrs Ashley’s ‘unreasonable refusal to allow him to resume occupation’, Mr Swirsky told the judge that, in the event that it is impossible for Mr Ashley to return to the house, his client wants it sold and the proceeds split. ‘If it is impossible for him to live at the property, the purpose for which the trust was created has come to an end and the court can make an order for sale,’ he said. ‘This is a situation where there is over £1million of equity in the property, and each occupier would be entitled to at least £500,000 on sale. ‘That should be enough to accommodate two people separately, even in London in 2014.’ The deed details the rights of occupancy and it is the interpretation of this that has led to the court case. Mr Ashley said he helped to purchase the home so that his mother would have ‘somewhere safe to see out her days’. But Mr Swirsky said the deed of trust was also supposed to be an investment that he would inherit after his mother’s death. Mrs Ashley claims that the deed was intended to provide a home for the rest of her life just for her. When her son said he’d like to ‘spend more time there’, the pair began rowing. By December 2012, she had banished him from the home and changed the locks after he allegedly allowed strangers to lodge in the house, the court heard. Battle: The county court hearing took place inside the Royal Courts of Justice (pictured) in central London . Mr Swirsky, on claims that his client had harassed his mother, said: ‘The allegations consist of a number of telephone calls, a single instance of unspecified abuse in person, and a malicious call to the RSPCA.’ David Hyde, for Mrs Ashley, said she was within her rights to prevent her son living in the home. ‘There is evidence that Mr Ashley allowed strangers into the house as lodgers,’ he said. He also argued that Mr Ashley had no right to occupy the house under the trust deed. Judge Diana Faber reserved her judgment following the three-day hearing and will give her decision at a later date.","Mitchim Ashley and his mother Elizabeth, 79, are each suing each other .

"As preparations are made for the roll-out of Hello Kitty's 40th birthday festivities in Los Angeles, the company that makes the beloved mouthless feline wants to set the record straight: . Hello Kitty is not a cat at all, says Sanrio. She's a real human little girl who lives outside of London, has a twin sister and a cat of her own and will forever be in third grade. It's part of Hello Kitty's origin story that most of the world never glommed onto as the Japanese character steadily won over hearts and minds across the globe beginning in the early 1970s. Scroll down for video . Call her cute, call her adorable, but don't call her a cat! Hello Kitty's 40th birthday brings with it the startling revelation (for some) that the Japanese character is actually a little human girl . And it's finally been dug up with the help of anthropologist Christine R. Yano, who's putting together the Hello Kitty retrospective in Los Angeles to honor the character's 40th anniversary. The truth came out as Sanrio edited Yano's script for the retrospective at the Japanese American National Museum. 'I was corrected — very firmly,' Yano told the LA Times. 'That's one correction Sanrio made for my script for the show. Hello Kitty is not a cat. She's a cartoon character. She is a little girl. 'She is not a cat. She's never depicted on all fours. She walks and sits like a two-legged creature. She does have a pet cat of her own, however, and it's called Charmmy Kitty.' Totally human: It turns out, Hello Kitty has a very rich backstory. She is a perpetual third grade girl who lives outside London, has a twin sister and even has a real cat of her own . She is a Scorpio born November 1. She has type A blood. Her real name is Kitty White. She has a twin sister named Mimmy White, who wears a yellow bow. she is 5 apples tall. She and her family live in a suburb of London, where a seal lives in their backyard. Source: Sanrio . As it turns out, Hello Kitty has an entire backstory created at a time when Japanese women romanticized life in England. 'She has a twin sister,' Yano continued.. 'She's a perpetual third-grader. She lives outside of London. I could go on.' Why Sanrio chose to portray the little girl as a cat with no mouth, Yano did not say. Instead of pondering Hello Kitty imponderables, it may be best to concentrate on the character's accomplishments. Besides reaching the ripe age of 40 without so much as a wrinkle, Hello Kitty recently made her first trek to outer space. A 4-cm (1.6-inch) tall Hello Kitty figure is aboard the Hodoyoshi-3 satellite, looking through a window at Earth, Sanrio announced this week. The satellite, which is about the size of a large rubbish bin, was developed by Japanese researchers as part of a $40 million program funded by the education and science ministry. Hello Kitty's retrospective opens October 11 and will remain on view through April 2015. The inaugural Hello Kitty Convention will also be held in Los Angeles from October 30 through November 2.

These photographs show how the latest plan for the world’s most famous liner – whose passengers included the Queen, George W Bush, Nelson Mandela and Hollywood legends including Ginger Rogers and Debbie Reynolds – appear to have stalled. The QE2 has spent the past six years docked in Dubai awaiting renovation. Last year it was announced she was to return to the seas and was scheduled to depart in October 2013 and sail to China. She was then to be converted into a £60million 400-suite floating hotel before travelling to her final destination, a yet to be announced Asian city, at the end of this year. The plan also involved revamping the ballroom, seven restaurants, ten lounges and cinema. But she has yet to set sail, and her sorry state has angered former crew and campaigners who want her to be restored to her old splendour. Yesterday Louis de Sousa, 43, of Bitzen, Germany, who was a bartender on the QE2 for nine years in the 1990s and received these photos of her from workers he befriended on Facebook, said: ‘The ship is an icon, but she’s just sitting there rotting.

The other photos which Mr de Sousa – who remembers functions on the QE2 attended by Lady Thatcher and Rod Stewart – sent to the Daily Mail were taken between June this year and last week. Rob Lightbody, 42, of Glasgow, who runs the world’s most popular QE2 website, said: ‘They keep making all these announcements about what’s going to happen to her, then it just goes silent and now she’s just sitting there. ‘She is the last of her type – British built, British designed, and originally British crewed. She is in the wrong place. Most people in Dubai don’t even know she’s there, nor do they care.’ Grand: Princess Diana with children . on the QE2  for a children's party to celebrate the ship's return to service after a refit in 1987.

Star-studded: Originally featuring three classes of service, the ship appealed to celebrities such  Elton John (left), Peter Sellers (right) and Ringo Starr (far right). It also captured the imagination of the less affluent . Alan Snelson, a photographer who worked on the ship, told arabianbusiness.com: ‘If no viable plan can be put in place by her owners then they should release her to someone who can save her before the damage is irreversible.’ The 963ft ship carried almost 2.5million passengers and completed more than 700 Atlantic crossings following her launch from the John Brown shipyard in Clydebank in 1967. The QE2’s home port was then Southampton for 40 years until she left for the last time in November 2008 after being sold to Dubai for £70million. No one from the Oceanic Group, which unveiled the plans to ‘transform the QE2 into a luxurious heritage five-star hotel’ last year, was available to comment yesterday.

Above, the vessel was capable of reaching a top speed of 39mph . The QE2 was initially designed as a transatlantic service between her home port of Southampton and New York. Operated by Cunard, she began an almost 40 year career in 1969 and served as the flagship of the line until succeeded by RMS Queen Mary 2 in 2004. During her years of service, the QE2 undertook regular world cruises and was known as being the height of glamour. Originally featuring three classes of service, the ship appealed to stars such as Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton and also captured the imagination of those less affluent, who were blocked by stairways and elevators from entering first-class spaces even for a peek. Passengers dressed for dinner in formal gowns and tuxedos and top-name show-biz stars entertained. In May 1982 she even took part in the Falklands War, carrying 3000 troops and 650 volunteer crews. This involved her being refitted with three helicopter pads, dormitories and fuel pipes to allow for refuelling at sea. Incredibly, more than 650 Cunard crew members volunteered for the voyage to transport the members of the Fifth Infantry Brigade. The vessel returned to the UK in June 1982 and was greeted in Southampton by Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother.","Queen Elizabeth II was destined to become a luxury hotel in Middle East .

"Colonel Gaddafi was good for immigration control as he helped stop North Africans coming to Britain, Ukip candidate Mark Reckless has said. The former MP, who defected from the Tories triggering the by-election in Rochester, said the former Libyan leader had stopped boats taking migrants across the Mediterranean to Italy. Ukip leader Nigel Farage agreed with the comments and said the dictator, accused of killing hundreds of his own people, brought ‘stability’ to the country. He claimed helping remove Gaddafi was one of David Cameron’s biggest mistakes . Gaddafi fan:  Mark Reckless, who defected to Ukip in September, spoke out in support of the late Libyan dictator, saying Colonel Gaddafi was good for immigration control . At a rally in the Kent constituency, Mr Reckless said: ‘Whatever people say about Gaddafi, one thing is he didn’t allow those boats to come across. ‘He had an agreement with Italy that stopped it. Since he’s gone we’ve no idea what’s going on in Libya, it’s too dangerous for anyone to go there.’ Asked if he agreed, Mr Farage replied: ‘Of course.’ The Ukip leader insisted that the ‘bad guys’ were being replaced by ‘even worse guys’ and said action in Libya had been Mr Cameron’s biggest mistakes. He added: ‘We bombed them, that’s what we did. That’s how this government helped Libya. It got rid of somebody, albeit an Arab nationalist dictator, who actually gave a level of stability to the area.’ Mr Reckless’ remarks were compared to the famous last excuse for Facism, ‘say what you like about Mussolini, he made the trains on time.’ 'Oh, Reckless': Ukip leader Farage did not seem at all unhappy with Mark Reckless' support of the Colonel, and agreed with his new candidate, saying removing Gaddafi was one of David Cameron’s biggest mistakes . Shaking hands with the devil: Mr Reckless said: ‘Whatever people say about Gaddafi, one thing is he didn’t allow those boats to come across' Labour MP Chris Bryant said last night said: ‘First Farage says he admires Putin, then Reckless praises Gaddafi. Why don’t they go the whole way and say they support Kim Il Sung, Genghis Khan and Stalin and be done with it?’ Colonel Gaddafi died after the UN security council approved bombing raids led by Britain, France and the U.S. designed to assist rebel militias battling against forces loyal to Gaddafi on the ground. He was eventually captured and shot dead by the victorious rebels in 2011. During his rule his government supplied weapons to the IRA and other terrorist groups, was behind the Lockerbie bombing – the biggest act of terrorism in Britain history, which killed 270 people in 1988 – and the 1984 murder of WPC Yvonne Fletcher. Tens of thousands of migrants each year cross from North Africa to Europe, many in dangerous wooden baots. Last October 359 people were killed when a boat making the crossing sank off the Italian island Lampedusa. Senior Tories had declared the Rochester and Strood by-election on November 20 a ‘must-win’, but‎ Mr Reckless has a 15 point lead over his former party according to the latest opinion poll. Mr Cameron had pledged to ‘throw the kitchen sink’ at the attempt to hold the seat and halt the Ukip surge. There are warnings that the Prime Minister could face a leadership challenge if the Conservatives fail to win. Former leadership contender David Davis was last week reported to be taking soundings about a possible plot to depose Mr Cameron if the seat is lost. Mr Davis is said to have told fellow MPs that there is a ‘window’ of opportunity to organise a vote of no confidence in Mr Cameron between the by-election and Christmas. The contest comes after Douglas Carswell became the first elected Ukip MP last month.","Former MP Mark Reckless spoke out in support of Libyan dictator .

"Cancer patients in Wales are being denied life-saving new treatments being made available to those in England, campaigners warn today. The Labour-run Welsh government’s refusal to fund the drugs has left patients with no choice but to move across the border, where they have a chance of getting help through the Cancer Drugs Fund, or raid their savings. Although it insists it cannot afford a cancer drugs fund, the administration in Cardiff spends more than £30million a year on providing free prescriptions for everyone – even the wealthiest – including for drugs available over the counter such as aspirin. The Labour-run Welsh government’s refusal to fund the drugs has left patients with no choice but to move across the border, where they have a chance of getting help through the Cancer Drugs Fund . Last night Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt compared the state of the NHS in Wales to the Mid Staffordshire scandal, and said an inquiry was now needed into shocking revelations over ‘care failures and cover-ups’. He added: ‘More appalling than the problems themselves is the fact the Welsh Labour government continues to resist calls to sort them out. I wholeheartedly support the Daily Mail’s calls for an investigation.’ On the fifth day of this paper’s series exposing the crisis, we reveal: . ■ There are 71 types of advanced cancer treatment available in England under a special fund that are not routinely on offer in Wales. ■ Half of Welsh patients’ requests for new cancer drugs not on officially approved lists were turned down in 2012-13, Rare Cancers Foundation research found. ■ Last year the Welsh NHS spent £4.6million on prescribing paracetamol and nearly £2million on dispensing aspirin. English cancer patients now have routine access to medication such as Avastin, which can extend their lives by years, thanks to the £200million Cancer Drugs Fund set up in 2010. But in Wales, seriously ill people must make individual patient funding requests, which are frequently rejected. Fewer than one in 20 of the patients in England treated via the fund would have been treated if they lived in Wales, according to the Rarer Cancers Foundation. Health campaigners have demanded an investigation into the Labour-run Welsh NHS. Ed Miliband intends to place running NHS at heart of Labour's election campaign next May - despite the party's dismal record . Kate Northcott set up a campaign to help cancer patients when her mother Pamela died in 2007 aged 58 after being refused a pioneering treatment by Welsh authorities. She has witnessed the divergence of patients’ fates at the Countess of Chester Hospital, which treats people from both England and Wales because it is near the border. She said the waiting room is divided into two groups – one is going to get access to treatment and one isn’t. The Rarer Cancers Foundation calculated in 2011 that setting up a cancer drugs fund for Wales would cost £3.3million a year, but this could be higher depending on treatments. The Welsh government introduced free prescriptions for all in 2007. Until then the NHS in Wales had recouped about £32million a year from charges for prescribed drugs. Last year an average of 24.8 prescriptions per person were given out, compared with 19.1 in England, 18.6 in Scotland and 21.1 in Northern Ireland. A Welsh government spokesman said: ‘We will not be replacing our system with a cancer drugs fund – the chair of the fund in England has admitted it provides funding for drugs which have “no impact on survival” and “uncertainty” on whether quality of life is improved. ‘We spend more per head on cancer care than in England and we do not agree with spending millions on non-approved medicines. ‘We are proud prescriptions in Wales are free for everyone, removing a barrier to long-term good health.’ Terminally-ill Cheryl Sheard said she had not even been told about the life-prolonging drug Avastin until she went to England to be treated for her cervical cancer. The mother-of-two, of Dyserth in North Wales, said: ‘Avastin was never mentioned to me in Wales. But doctors in Liverpool offer it as standard.’ Mrs Sheard, 36, was told her cancer was terminal by doctors in Glan Clwyd Hospital. After she asked for a second opinion, specialists in Liverpool were willing to try surgery. Terminally-ill Cheryl Sheard said she had not even been told about the life-prolonging drug Avastin until she went to England to be treated for her cervical cancer . This was not a success, but it was then she was told about Avastin, which costs £24,000 a year but could prolong her life by months. She said the difference in care was ‘staggering’. ‘Doctors in Liverpool tried so much more. Glan Clwyd just said there was no point,’ she said. Her case for Avastin funding has been put to Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, but months on she is yet to be given the green light. She added: ‘I know this drug is not going to save my life. But if it prolongs my life by one week, I have to try. I’ve got two young children. I’ve got to fight for everything. I’m praying for a miracle.’ A Betsi Cadwaladr spokesman said: ‘We are satisfied patients are given access to these drugs where it can be demonstrated they are most likely to benefit.’ The NHS in Wales has been accused of ‘wasting’ hundreds of thousands of pounds on trade union officials rather than paying for treatments. Freedom of information figures showed large sums being spent on the wages of staff engaged in union activity either full- or part-time. Tory MPs slammed the Labour-run Welsh government for spending more than £1.5million in the past three years on what has been branded a ‘scandalous subsidy’ to the unions. ‘Facility time’ is paid time for trade union representatives to take part in union duties. It is provided for in the Employment Relations Act 1999 and the Trade Union Labour Relations Act 1992. Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board spent more than £500,000 in three years for staff to undertake union activities, while Cwm Taf University Health Board spent £100,000 a year on four union representatives. Welsh health minister Mark Drakeford’s spokesman said: ‘The Tories in Westminster have lost the plot on the NHS. Now they’re attacking the rights of hard-working NHS staff to have proper representation.’","Welsh cancer patients are being denied life-saving new treatments .

"David Cameron and other Cabinet ministers have held private dinners for 45 businessmen and hedge fund bosses, the Conservatives have disclosed. The rich supporters, who included only two women, were hosted by senior politicians in the last three months of 2014. According to the party’s latest transparency data, the dinners were held for members of the Prime Minister’s ‘leaders group’ who have collectively given more than £40 million since 2010. Prime Minister David Cameron and other Cabinet ministers have held private dinners for 45 businessmen and hedge fund bosses, the Conservatives have disclosed in their latest transparency data . Overall, donors who belong to the club have targeted about £5 million at local constituency associations, of which more than 70 are marginals. In exchange for donating £50,000 or more each, the donors get access to the Prime Minister and his cabinet at private dinners. Jon Ashworth, Labour’s shadow Cabinet Office minister, said the filing showed the Conservatives had become ‘the political wing of the hedge fund industry’. ‘An elite few are helping the Tories try to buy the election. These are the same millionaires and hedge funds who the Tories have given a tax cut to,’ he said. The revelation comes just a week after it emerged that, at a ‘black and white ball’ in Mayfair, guests bid for the chance to go shoe shopping with Home Secretary Theresa May, and go jogging with Nicky Morgan, the Education Secretary. The most elite group of donors are instead invited to regular, more intimate meals with Cameron and key ministers where they can discuss politics and policy. The revelation comes just a week after it emerged that at a Mayfair ball guests bid for the chance to go shoe shopping with Home Secretary Theresa May (pictured left) or go jogging with Nicky Morgan (right) The latest filing shows ministers entertained 45 donors – all but two of whom are male – in the last quarter of 2014. Cameron also hosted one hedge fund boss, Sir Michael Hintze, and his wife at Chequers in October. An analysis by Labour found more than 40 per cent of the money donated by the leaders group came from the hedge fund industry, which was given a £145 million tax break by George Osborne in 2013. One of those to attend was Georg von Opel, a Swiss national. The donor’s office said previously: ‘Mr von Opel … is a Swiss national and a Swiss resident since 1973.’ Other wealthy donors who attended the dinners include Michael Spencer, the founder of City inter-dealer broker Icap, Howard Shore, founder and largest shareholder in small company brokers Shore Capital, and Lord Farmer, the metals trading tycoon and Conservative party treasurer. Labour's Jon Ashworth (pictured) said the filing showed the Conservatives had become ‘the political wing of the hedge fund industry’ Another is Alexander Temerko, a director of Offshore Group Newcastle, who told the Newcastle Journal in November: ‘The Conservative party today helps business and construction business, not so effectively as me and my colleagues expected but it is still true. ‘They spend time and they listen to us, they change the law and they change the regulation, and the regulation today is simpler and much more effective and today there is real partnership between business and government.’ It comes as separate claims emerged last night about another industry which was routinely avoiding paying income tax on earnings. Multi-millionaire chiefs of private equity firms pay are paying less tax than teachers and nurses due to a little-known loophole, a report claimed last night. Some of Britain’s richest City bosses pay little as 28 per cent tax on their earnings because of a so-called ‘sweetheart deal’ which allows them to pay capital gains tax instead of income tax. This is huge saving for managers who would otherwise have to pay 40 per cent tax on income over £41,865 and 45 per cent on earnings over £150,000. A study by Campaign group 38 Degrees claimed the ‘Mayfair loophole’ is costing the Treasury up to £700 million a year in lost income tax and National Insurance contributions. Fund managers are able to pay capital gains tax – which is levied on profit from the sale of an investment – because they claim their earnings are returns from investments, rather than a guaranteed salary. Private equity firms raise money from investors and use it to purchase companies, often selling the company on for a substantial profit a few years later. But 38 Degrees is now calling on Chancellor George Osborne to announce the closure of the loophole in his March Budget. They said the Government's 2015 Finance Bill allowed the long-standing loophole to continue, despite containing other anti-avoidance measures. More than one in six of Conservative donors who have attended David Cameron's 'donor dinners' in 2014 were private equity bosses, the group claimed. David Babbs, of 38 Degrees, said: ‘This Mayfair tax loophole is government-sponsored tax avoidance on a breathtaking scale. ‘Money which should be funding the NHS is going to millionaire fund managers instead. Chancellor George Osborne is being called on to announce the closure of a tax loophole in his March Budget . ‘The rest of us pay in our fair share to keep the country going – why should millionaire financiers be treated differently? ‘In his last Budget before the election, George Osborne wants to convince the country that he's on the side of hardworking families on average incomes. If he wants us to take him seriously, he's got to close the Mayfair tax loophole.’ The group claimed that, under Labour in 2003, the private equity industry successfully lobbied to have a special guarantee issued by HMRC that its tax affairs ‘will not be challenged’. Twelve years ago, HMRC signed a ‘Memorandum of Understanding’ with the BVCA, which represents private equity firms, apparently clarifying that as long as a private equity firm ‘structures itself and its remuneration in a particular way’, their income could be treated as capital gains. HMRC denied that this was a ‘special arrangement’. In 2007, Nicholas Ferguson, former chairman of leading private equity firm SVG Capital, said ‘any commonsense person would say that a highly-paid private equity executive paying less tax than a cleaning lady or other low-paid workers can't be right’. Labour pledged to look again at the loophole, but this has remained in place under the Coalition. A Treasury source said last night the treatment of private equity profits was ‘agreed by the previous Labour government’. They said: ‘We raised the rate of Capital Gains Tax from 18 per cent to 28 per cent so this government has actually increased tax on private equity. ‘It was outrageous that under Labour cleaners paid a higher rate tax than the people who employed them.’","Prime Minister and Cabinet members held private dinners for 45 people .

"Nurses at a scandal-hit NHS hospital are being investigated by police for allegedly drugging elderly and difficult patients to enjoy a quiet night shift. The issue was raised after Gareth Williams was told by nurses that patients on his mother's ward at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, South Wales were being given powerful sedatives without prescription. Mr Williams was told what was happening by a whistleblowing nurse before the death of his 82-year-old mother Lillian Williams. It has already been admitted in her case during Protection of Vulnerable Adults investigation into her death. Mrs Williams, a mother-of-five who was left with one leg after an amputation, died 15 months ago after a catalogue of neglect at the hospital, which is part of the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University local health board. An investigation has been launched at the Princess of Wales Hospital into claims that nurses drugged elderly and vulnerable patients without prescription or consent in order to make sure they had an 'easy night shift' In the wake of her case, police have referred criminal charges against nurses at the hospital for allegedly giving sedatives to vulnerable patients without prescription or consent. Mr Williams said: 'A nurse told me she had witnessed patients regularly being given unnecessary sedation without prescription at night to make life easier for the night shift team. 'I told nurses I had been promised by my mother's doctor she would not be sedated without consent or prescription. 'They said it is alright for them to promise the impossible and then walk off but we have to cope with them all night. 'A nurse told us many of the people being sedated are very ill and very frail and if you give them the wrong drug it could kill them.' The hospital is already at the centre of a major police investigation with five nurses charged with falsifying medical records and willful neglect. Richard Baker, a barrister who represented families at the inquiry into appalling care and high death rates at Mid-Staffordshire NHS Trust, said that using drugs without the consent of patients so staff could have a quiet night would be inappropriate. He said: 'The use of drugs inappropriately, in patients who could not offer consent would also be wrong. Administering medication to sedate patients so that staff could have a quiet night would be an inappropriate use of that medication. 'Both would be gross breaches of nursing and clinical standards and would likely lead to disciplinary action. 'As to seriousness, it would evidently have the potential to end the careers of the people involved.' The allegations came to light after a nurse told Gareth Williams his mother Lillian Williams, 82, was one of a number of patients being given powerful sedatives without consent or prescription at the hospital . Mr Williams said the nurse said she'd seen patients on his mother's ward given drugs without prescription . Welsh Assembly Member Bethan Jenkins has written to Ed Beltrami, the Chief Crown Prosecutor for the CPS in Wales, to ask him to speed up the process of reviewing the evidence and to bring charges. She said police had been investigating since Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board (ABMU) admitted that Mrs Williams was 'sedated unnecessarily without consent'. Ms Jenkins, Plaid Cymru AM for South Wales West, said a whistleblower nurse working for the health board had approached Mrs Williams' family and told them that 'for years she has witnessed night staff on Ward 6 sedating elderly vulnerable patients without prescription'. Ms Jenkins said the family had been involved in a 'protracted battle' to get an answer about what happened to their mother. She said: 'So naturally they are at a loss to understand why it has taken 16 months for the police to investigate and why there is not yet a decision from the CPS as to whether these admissions of very serious abuses and neglects amount to crimes. 'They believe - as do I - that 16 months is ample time to investigate and come to a decision. Bereaved families need closure, and the delays in this investigation are only putting off that day.' Helen Rundle, a lawyer leading calls for a public inquiry into allegations of abuse in the Welsh NHS, said a decision on charges by the CPS would be made in the next few weeks. A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said: 'South Wales Police is investigating complaints regarding the quality of care provided to Lilian Williams whilst she was an in-patient at both The Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend and Neath Port Talbot Hospital during 2010 and 2012 respectively. 'Whilst the CPS has been in contact with South Wales Police in relation to this aspect of the investigation, we have not been asked to provide formal charging advice. In mid-November, the CPS received a report from South Wales Police seeking observations on their findings and the content of that report is currently under consideration. 'We have recently received correspondence on this matter from elected Assembly Members and representatives of the victim's family. It would be therefore be inappropriate for us to comment further before we have responded directly to these enquiries.' A spokesman for the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board said they were cooperating with the ongoing police investigation, but said it would be inappropriate to comment until it was complete.

"A grandfather was killed and his wife is fighting for her life after they were run over by their own car. Neighbours said Iftikhar Ali, 65, and wife Hazim, 63, were crushed under the estate vehicle when it rolled down a steep hill outside their home as they loaded the boot yesterday morning. Mr Ali is believed to have tried to stop the runaway Peugeot 406, but was dragged underneath along with his wife as it rolled more than 50 yards. Police were called to the steep street in Brynmill, Swansea (above), where a man and woman were trapped under a car. The man was killed in the incident while the woman was airlifted to hospital . Firefighters lifted the car off the couple, but Mr Ali suffered multiple injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene. Mrs Ali, who was conscious, was airlifted to hospital, where last night she was said to be in a critical condition. It is not known whether the car’s brakes failed or there was a fault that caused the car to roll. The couple are believed to have moved to Britain from Iraq more than 20 years ago and lived a quiet life in a basement flat in Swansea’s Brynmill district. The residential street in Brynmill, Swansea, is on a steep hill. Police said the car 'rolled down' towards the man and woman involved in the incident at around 9.20am . Neighbour Paul Thomas said: ‘They have been here for many years and were very private people. But they were very devoted to each other and were always together. They were very polite and always said hello.’ The car will have mechanical tests as police compile a report for an inquest into the tragedy. 'Initial reports are that a vehicle has rolled down the street trapping a male and female underneath the vehicle,' a spokesman for South Wales Police said this morning.

"Ward Alshammary died of a cardiac arrest after doctors failed to spot a major infection . As five-year-old Ward Alshammary lay dying, she asked her father one last heartbreaking question: ‘Why are you crying, Daddy?’ The brave schoolgirl was suffering a cardiac arrest brought on by an illness that doctors failed to spot, an inquest heard. She had been sent home from hospital by medics who believed she simply had a virus. But two days later she was rushed back when her condition deteriorated rapidly. It turned out Ward was suffering from bronchial pneumonia and a major infection between her lungs and chest wall. As they prepared to move her to paediatric intensive care from a high dependency unit, they gave her medication to tackle the bacterial infection but the youngster suffered a cardiac arrest. But just moments before she died, Ward gave her crying father Badr Alshammary a kiss and asked him why he was in tears. Speaking about how their lives had been turned upside down by her death, her father and mother Feraihah said they never thought they wouldn't come home from the hospital without their daughter. The couple, who used to live in Southampton, said: 'We were incredibly close to our daughter Ward. 'Although she was only five years old, she cared for us, as much as we cared for her. 'She loved her siblings and all of her friends at school. Ward loved going to school and she loved her teachers. 'When she grew up she wanted to be a paediatrician - she even told the doctor at the hospital that was what she wanted to be. 'After that first visit to the hospital, we thought she would be fine. Even when we went back on 21 January 2013, we did not expect to leave the hospital without our daughter. 'Ward's death has affected our lives significantly: our family life, our studies, every day, even walking down the street. 'We know that nothing can bring Ward back but we hope that knowledge of the circumstances in which Ward died, which we now understand in more detail, can prevent similar deaths in the future.' When she was first admitted, the little girl was examined and given an antihistamine drug before being sent home. And doctors at Southampton General Hospital, in Hampshire, told the family she would be well enough to mix with other children at school. This was despite being severe dehydration and she had not eaten or drunk for two days, Winchester Coroner's Court was told. She died in the early hours of January 22 after being readmitted and concerned staff had called in senior paediatric consultant Dr Peter Wilson. She suffered a cardiac arrest thought to have been brought on by a flood of toxins into her system and having suffered septic shock. Lawyers representing the Alshammary family questioned if the little girl may have survived had she been admitted directly to intensive care rather than time being lost at the high dependency unit. An internal investigation carried out by the hospital revealed there had been failings in her care. However Grahame Short, Senior Coroner for Central Hampshire, said it would never be known if her death could have been prevented by earlier treatment. An internal investigation at Southampton General Hospital, pictured, found there had been failings in the youngster's care . Her devastated parents said their little girl had big dreams of becoming a paediatrician when she grew up. Ward even made the point of telling the doctors and nurses of her chosen career as they checked her over and treated her on admission to hospital the first time. Her father added in a statement that on their first visit to A&E, he had been told by a first year trainee A&E specialist that she would recover within three days. He said: 'The doctor said it was a normal rash and not contagious. 'She told me she would be okay to go back to school and be around other children.' Recording a verdict of death by natural causes, Mr Short said the 'failure to recognise Ward's deteriorating condition' caused 'a delay in the initial amount of immediate treatment'. He said: 'With the benefit of hindsight we now know there have been failings in individual decisions which, if they had been different, might have prevented the tragic outcome in this case.' Her additional infection in the child's lung lining, which clinicians were unaware of at the time, may have been 'highly-relevant' to her sudden, rapid deterioration, he added. Mr Short said: 'The central issue in this case is whether it would have made any difference if her true medical condition had been recognised sooner. 'It may well have been different if she had been moved to the paediatric intensive care unit and she was treated sooner, but I don't know that - and I don't believe that we'll ever know.' The inquest heard how an internal investigation carried out by Southampton General Hospital into Ward's death concluded that there had been failings. It said doctors had not appreciated the gravity of her condition in the final hours of her life, the court was told. Giving evidence, paediatric consultant Dr Jason Barling was asked if she would have already contracted pneumonia three days before her death on her first hospital visit. He admitted it was not known and said: 'It could have been present at the time, but it could also have not been present until 24 hours later.' Dr Barling added that since Ward's death there had been briefings across the NHS region and there was now increased awareness of how to manage Sepsis in children when they were hospitalised. Juliet Pearce, patient safety manager at University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, added: 'Our thoughts and sympathies remain with Ward's family at what continues to be a very difficult time for them. 'As reported at the inquest hearing, Ward was assessed appropriately in our emergency department and the circumstances surrounding her death, although extremely sad and distressing, could not have been predicted. 'We hope the coroner's determination will help to give the family a better understanding of the difficulties her condition presented and we offer them our full support as they continue to come to terms with their loss.'","Doctors sent Ward Alshammary home with a virus in January this year .

"Controversial plans for a BBC drama based on the kidnapping of schoolgirl Shannon Matthews have been put on hold amid fears the show could scupper the corporation's crucial licence fee negotiations. The TV drama, which was set to star Sheridan Smith as Shannon's mother Karen, was due to air towards the end of next year or in early 2016 – when the BBC's licence fee renewal will be up for debate with the Government. However, production has now been halted amid concerns it could provoke public anger and jeopardise the corporation's deal. Scroll down for video . The BBC drama was set to follow the case of schoolgirl Shannon Matthews (pictured) who disappeared in February 2008 after being kidnapped by her own mother. She was found by police after a £3.2million manhunt . The TV drama, which was set to star award-winning actress Sheridan Smith (right) as Shannon's mother Karen (pictured left after her daughter's disappearance in 2008 ), was due to air late 2015 or in early 2016 . The show was set to be based on the kidnapping of Shannon, who was just nine-years-old when she disappeared from her home in Dewsbury Moor, West Yorkshire, in February 2008. Her disappearance sparked a £3.2million police hunt and her mother appeared before the media pretending to be distraught as hundreds of local people helped in the search. However, Shannon was found 24 days later by police, hidden in a compartment under a divan bed in a flat one mile from where she lived with her mother. She had been drugged and tethered under the bed by her mother and accomplice Michael Donovan, then 40, as part of a desperate plot to claim £50,000 in reward money. They had planned to release the schoolgirl at Dewsbury Market, drive around the corner to 'discover her' then take her to a police station and claim the reward before splitting it 50/50. However, the pair's horrific crime was discovered by police and Matthews, a mother of seven, and Donovan were jailed for eight years for kidnapping, false imprisonment and perverting the course of justice. Matthews (left) and accomplice Michael Donovan, then 40 (right), kidnapped Shannon as part of a desperate plot to claim £50,000 in reward money, which they planned to split 50/50. They were both jailed for eight years . Karen Matthews lived in Dewsbury Moor, West Yorkshire (above), when she kidnapped her daughter in 2008 . They have both since been released from prison after serving half their sentence and Karen, 38, has undergone a drastic change in appearance, by cutting off her long, red hair and losing a considerable amount of weight, as part of attempts to live under a new identity. Initial plans for the BBC drama sparked outcry earlier this year with Simon Reevell, the Conservative MP for Dewsbury, describing it as 'inappropriate'. At the time, he said: 'I don't think it is a very good topic or use of BBC money. I don't see how it is helpful for the victim to have this dragged across the screen for entertainment.' And Rev Canon Kevin Partington of Dewsbury Minster said: 'I can't see the point of it – the whole community has moved on.' Plans for the show first emerged in the summer when writer Jeff Pope suggested award-winning actress Sheridan Smith, who recently appeared in ITV drama Cilla, was set to play the lead role. Speaking at the Guardian Edinburgh International Television Festival in August, Mr Pope said the project would be 'extremely complex' and said 'it's very early stages' before confirming Smith's involvement. However, the show – which was going to be made for the BBC and created by ITV Studios, where Mr Pope is head of factual drama – has now been put on hold ahead of the BBC's crucial licence fee negotiations. According to The Sunday People, a source said: 'A lot of work had already gone into this drama and if all had gone according to plan it would have been out at the end of next year or early 2016 – but suddenly everything stopped. Matthews, a mother of seven, went on TV pretending to be distraught over the disappearance of her daughter . The schoolgirl's case sparked outpouring from the community which rallied around to help find her . 'The explanation was the powers-that-be at the BBC said the potential fallout ahead of the charter renewal and licence fee negotiations was too high a price to pay for the drama so it's been mothballed.' However, the BBC said it remains committed to the project and confirmed the show had not been dropped, but temporarily put on hold. A spokesman said: 'Whilst we remain committed to this project, we have decided to pause in order to progress some important production and editorial matters. 'It is misleading to suggest this is anything other than an editorial decision.' It comes amid suggestions the BBC's TV licence fee could be scrapped and replaced with subscriptions in the biggest shake-up since the corporation was founded in 1922. Some members of the Cabinet are understood to believe the compulsory £145.50 annual charge for television ownership is increasingly outdated. Senior industry figures also believe a fundamental rethink is required in a multi-channel age with more and more viewers using computers and mobile phones to watch programmes on internet catch-up services. The BBC's royal charter, which sets out the corporation's scope and remit, and funding arrangement – both ten-year agreements – is up for renewal at the end of 2016. One possibility suggested to change the way the licence fee is handled is a subscription model, whereby viewers who want BBC services purchase a 'bundle' of channels, or even individual programmes or series. Subscriptions could replace some or all of the compulsory licence fee – breaking the link between owning a TV set and the licence fee. The BBC drama has allegedly been shelved amid fears it could spark public outrage at a time when the BBC is in negotiations with the Government over the future of the corporation's TV licence fee (file picture) An alternative model, being used in Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands, would see a payment for the national broadcaster simply rolled into household taxes. Like other areas of public spending it would be subject to cuts in times of austerity. However, the BBC said the licence fee remained the most popular option among viewers. A spokesman said: ‘It’s vital that programmes like EastEnders, Strictly, Sherlock, Doctor Who and Match of the Day can been watched by everyone - not a select few; and support for the licence fee has actually risen by 22 per cent since 2004 and remains the most popular way of funding the BBC.' The Government has already announced a review of whether non-payment of the licence fee should be decriminalised. Ministers say it cannot be right that 200,000 people a year end up in court accused of not buying a TV licence. They currently face fines of up to £1,000 and a criminal record, with more than 50 a year going to prison. One possibility being touted is for new technology to be used to cut off BBC channels for those who have not paid. However, the BBC has previously said it would cost in the region of half a billion pounds to implement. Decriminalising non-payment for a licence would pave the way for more fundamental reform in the charter review, which will begin in earnest after the election.","BBC drama was set to star actress Sheridan Smith as Karen Matthews .

"Joanne Callen has accused Carole  Middleton, who is her godmother, of being 'snobbish' A feud in the Middleton  family has taken a new turn, with Kate’s uncle wading in to  condemn scathing comments made by her cousin. Joanne Callen spoke yesterday of her sadness at not having seen the Middletons since the Royal Wedding. She also accused Carole  Middleton, who is her godmother, of being ‘snobbish’. Mrs Middleton, a cousin of Miss Callen’s mother, ignores the family and behaves as if she is ‘grander than the Queen’, Miss Callen claimed. The 33-year-old’s words were met with dismay by Gary Goldsmith, the Duchess of Cambridge’s colourful uncle. He told the Daily Mail: ‘I love my family very much and I have to question Joanne’s motivation for doing this piece.’ Mr Goldsmith saw his share of controversy when undercover reporters filmed him allegedly preparing lines of cocaine at his eight-acre hideaway in Ibiza. He has insisted he is still close to the family, but Miss Callen claimed he had been ‘dropped’. She suggested Mrs Middleton, 59, used him as an excuse for shunning relatives by refusing to be seen with Mr Goldsmith at social occasions. Miss Callen told the Mail On Sunday: ‘Carole doesn’t reply to invitations and doesn’t turn up at any family events. She claims that she won’t go anywhere where Gary is but I think she is just making excuses. ‘The real reason is that she is above us now. We’re not in her social circle. It’s as if we are not good enough now and she’s embarrassed by us. She is now even grander than the Queen.’ She added: ‘When I was a child Carole was really good to me. She was a very good mother, a lovely godmother, and I liked her. But she has always been a social climber and now I feel she is snobbish. She behaves as if we are not good enough for her now – so she does not need to respond to us or have any care. ‘At the end of the day, I’m not sure what the word goddaughter means any more.’ Miss Callen said she was sad never to have met Prince George, adding that her grandparents had bought him a gift but never had a chance to give it to him. She said that by speaking out she was going against her own family’s wish to remain discreet. The Middletons did not respond to requests for comment last night. Scroll down for video .

In an interview last year Mr Goldsmith insisted he was close to his sister. He said: ‘Carole and I are both headstrong and can bicker, as all siblings do. But we are very close. We tease each other relentlessly. In many ways we are very similar: we’re both ambitious with lots of drive, we made our money young, are very loyal to our families and want the best for them. ‘But I’m the City yuppie and she’s the country girl. While I was driving a Lotus Esprit in my Gucci shoes, she had an Alfasud and wore Hunter wellies.’ Family fun: Young Kate (left) and Joanne meet up for Christmas in 1991 with Carole and her mother Dorothy .","Joanne .

"Shocking waiting lists in the Welsh NHS mean patients are dying before they can be treated, it emerged last night. Others become too ill for doctors to save their lives because of the length of time before tests or surgery. Faced with the potentially fatal delays, many Welsh patients end up raiding their life savings to pay for private treatment. Fears: Jeremy Hunt demanded that international watchdogs be allowed into Wales to carry out a comparative study of healthcare around the UK amid fears over the quality of care . Nearly 1,400 patients annually wait at least a year for an operation, figures obtained by the Liberal Democrats show. In England, which is 17 times larger, only 574 people suffer the same delay. Kirsty Williams, Leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats said: 'These figures are nothing short of a national disgrace. It is completely unacceptable that nearly 1,400 people are being forced to wait over a year before being treated. 'Month after month we see the Welsh Government's 36 week target being missed. However these figures show the problem is even worse than once thought. 'My concern is that the Welsh Labour Government seems entirely clueless on how to turn things around. Waiting lists are piling up and there is little sign of the situation improving. 'This is why we need to establish a Commission to secure a historic and long-term plan for health and social care in Wales. A Commission with cross-party, professional and patient representatives would be able to work together and deal with the strategic problems facing our NHS in Wales. By involving doctors, nurses and patients from the outset, we would ensure that the experiences of those using our front-line health services feed into the efforts to reform our NHS. 'Whether it is inadequate cancer care, poor ambulance response times or dire A&E waiting times, the Welsh Labour Government is failing to provide the health service that patients in Wales deserve.' The figures emerged on the third day of a Daily Mail series exposing the inadequacies of the Labour-run health service in Wales – and prompting interventions both sides of the border: . * In London, Jeremy Hunt demanded that international watchdogs be allowed into Wales to carry out a comparative study of healthcare around the UK; . * The Health Secretary also said English hospitals were coming under 'intolerable pressures' from cross-border patients; . * In Cardiff, Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood said patients had 'genuine concerns' that had to be taken seriously. In just five years, 99 heart disease victims have died while awaiting treatment at hospitals in Cardiff and Swansea. The lengthy delays were a 'plausible explanation' for their deaths, the Royal College of Surgeons said. Other patients deteriorate in the months before their operations, making it more difficult to treat them when they go under the knife. The college warned last year that cardiac patients were regularly dying on the waiting list for surgery at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff. Today's investigation has uncovered shocking stories including that of a retired businessman who expects to be dead by Christmas because delays in seeing a heart specialist have left him too ill to be treated. Robin Williams, 69, had to wait three months to be referred to a consultant and it was another six months before he was given an appointment for an angiogram. By this time his condition was so serious that the specialist told him there was nothing more they could do. Official statistics show Welsh residents must wait much longer than their counterparts in England for essential diagnostic tests. Some 36.5 per cent wait more than six weeks for an MRI scan. Across the border the figure is just 1.2 per cent. A shocking 46.3 per cent of patients in Wales face waits of over six weeks for a colonoscopy examination, which is used to look for signs of bowel cancer. In England only 3.5 per cent do. Robin Williams, 69, had to wait three months to be referred to a consultant and another six months for an appointment for an angiogram . Ann Clwyd, Labour MP for Cynon Valley, who has campaigned on failings in the Welsh NHS, said: 'You can't start to receive treatment until you've had your diagnosis. 'What I have been saying all along is that it's morally wrong for patients in Wales to wait such a lengthy time – in some cases it is the difference between life and death. 'Too many people now are paying for private diagnosis when they can't afford it.' The Nuffield Trust warned recently that Wales's lengthening waiting times should 'set alarm bells ringing'. The trust published an authoritative report in April which noted that Welsh patients were waiting on average about 170 days for a hip or knee replacement, compared with about 70 days in England and Scotland. A fifth of patients in Wales who had hospital treatment in August after being referred by their GP or another medical practitioner had waited over six months. The target set by the Welsh government is for 95 per cent of people to be treated within this timeframe. The waiting list problem is exacerbated by the fact that 37,396 NHS procedures in Wales were cancelled last year for 'non-clinical reasons' such as hospital bed shortages. Welsh Conservatives leader Andrew RT Davies, who obtained the statistics, said: 'To find that so many families are facing delays to their treatment is extremely worrying, but to find that some patients have lost their lives as a result of pressure on waiting lists is simply unacceptable.' Miss Wood told the Welsh Assembly yesterday: 'Aren't we now at a point where as well as patients becoming increasingly concerned, health workers are becoming demoralised too?' A Welsh government spokesman said the number of postponed operations fell by a quarter last year. Welsh health minister Mark Drakeford yesterday wrote to all NHS staff in which he condemned 'political and media attacks' on the service. A Welsh government spokesman said: 'Since devolution in 1999, there has been a 92 per cent reduction in the number of patients waiting more than a year from initial referral by their GP to treatment. A shocking 46.3 per cent of patients in Wales face waits of over six weeks for a colonoscopy examination, which is used to look for signs of bowel cancer. In England only 3.5 per cent do . 'More people are being treated in the Welsh NHS today than at any time since its creation. Last year, nearly five million patients were seen in a hospital setting. 'The latest figures show the vast majority of patients – nearly nine out of ten – are seen within target time. 'The number of people waiting for routine treatment in Wales has increased over recent months, just as waiting lists have increased in other parts of the UK. 'Rising waiting times and numbers is a symptom of rising demand on all health services across the UK against a backdrop of significant cuts to public spending.' An urgent independent inquiry into the Welsh NHS is being demanded by the British Medical Association, the Conservatives, Plaid Cymru and Miss Clywd. Ruth Walker, Director of Nursing for Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, said: 'Whilst we are unable to respond with specific comments about a patient under our care, we are very surprised to hear of Mr Williams' concerns. We will be contacting him directly to better understand what has prompted them.' 'The health board has spoken openly and honestly over the last twelve months about the challenges it has been facing, along with the Welsh Health Specialist Services Committee, the commissioner of cardiac services in Wales, in meeting the growing demand for this important, expert care. 'Thanks to the hard work of staff and their commitment to tackle this issue we can confirm that by the end of the month no patient will be waiting longer than the 36 week target. 'There are also plans for investing in the service to further expand the number of procedures provided each year. 'We would once again extend our sincere apologies to anyone who has been affected by the problems last year and would ask anyone who has any concerns over their health or care to contact their GP for a review or to contact the health board directly. 'We would also like to reassure the public that Cardiff and Vale has some of the best outcomes for cardiac patients in the UK and our efforts to improve the service have been independently endorsed by the Royal College of Surgeons. We will continue to work with all our partners to build on these improvements.'","Long waiting lists means patients become too ill to be saved .

"The number of Britons going online has doubled since 2006 and almost half of the 33 million current UK internet users use social networks on a daily basis, new figures show. People in the UK were also found to be the second most prolific social network users in Europe - being beaten only by the Netherlands - according to figures from the latest report by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and Eurostat. The figures also discovered that although the majority of UK users are aged between 16 and 24 years old, 19 per cent of people aged 65 to 74 now use social networks. The Office for National Statistics and Eurostat have studied the number of people across Europe who are using social networks. The Netherlands tops the group at 65 per cent with the UK in second place, making up more than half - 57 per cent - of European social network users . The way you use Facebook and Twitter could mirror how narcissistic you are, according to a new university study. Research by the University of Michigan examined how social media websites reflect a growing culture of narcissism in the US. Scientists . found that middle-aged narcissists are more likely to frequently update . their Facebook status, while their younger counterparts take to Twitter . to satisfy their vanity. According to the study, Twitter acts as a megaphone for younger web users. As well as tracking internet use across Europe during 2012, the report also looked into how many people are accessing social networks from their mobile devices. The Opinions and Lifestyle survey is a monthly, face-to-face . survey carried out by the ONS. It samples around 2,010 adults in Great Britain each month and every year, between January and March, a section is included looking at internet use. According to the most recent report, almost half of all adults in the UK - 48 per cent - used social networking sites in 2012. Around two thirds - 62 per cent - of adults aged  35 to 55 use social networks to communicate online. While 40 per cent of adults aged 45 to 54 are now using social networks regularly. A fifth of 65 to 74 year olds surveyed by the ONS and Eurostat said they used social networks on a daily basis. In younger age groups, the highest proportion of 16 to 24 years olds using these social sites from mobile devices was found in Sweden at 40 per cent . As part of the 2012 Internet Access section, participants were asked about which activities they used the internet for, in the three months prior to their interview. One of the responses was 'Social networking, using websites e.g. Facebook or Twitter'. Analysis of the responses found that there was no difference in the use of social networking by men and women. However, there was a marked difference in use between age groups. In general, the proportion of adults recently using social networks decreased with age. In the 16 to 24 age group, 90 per cent of respondents used social networks in the three months before their interview. Yet 19 per cent of the 65 and over age group also selected this response. Within the EU the UK ranked second behind the Netherlands for social networking. Over half -  57 per cent - of UK adults reported that they had used social networks in the three months prior to the survey. This is compared to 65 per cent of Dutch people using social networks . Internet use figures were then collected across . Europe by Eurostat, so these UK findings could be compared to international use. Eurostat's findings were slightly broader than the UK's because it defined social network use as ‘posting messages to chat sites, . social networking sites, blogs, newsgroups, discussion forums and the . use of Instant Messaging (IM)’. Within the EU the UK ranked second behind the Netherlands for . social networking. Over half -  57 per cent - of UK adults reported that they had used . social networks in the three months prior to the survey. This is compared to 65 per cent of Dutch people using social networks, and 55 per cent of Swedish residents sat in third. According to the current ONS report, recent growth in social networking can 'partly be explained by increasing mobile Internet use in Great Britain.' In 2012, just over half - 52 per cent - of all adults used a mobile device to access the Internet and, of these, 63 per cent accessed social networks . In 2012 the UK was placed second out of all EU countries accessing social networks from mobile devices. Sweden topped the group with the highest proportion of adults - 40 per cent - using these social sites on the go . By . further comparison, the U.S. Census Bureau reported in May 2011 that half of all adults in the United States used 'social networking sites like . MySpace, Facebook or LinkedIn. According to the current ONS report, recent growth in social networking can 'partly be explained by increasing mobile Internet use in Great Britain.' In 2012, just over half - 52 per cent - of all adults used a mobile device to access the internet and, of these 63 per cent accessed social networks. The term 'mobile' in this context refers to any mobile or smart phone, PDA, MP3 player, e-book reader or handheld game console. It did not include tablet computers. In 2012, the UK was placed second out of . all EU countries accessing social networks from mobile devices. Sweden topped the group this time with the highest proportion of adults - 40 per cent - using these social sites on the go. As with overall internet use, social networking on a mobile device in Europe was most popular with the younger age groups. Approximately . seven out of 10 adults used mobile devices for accessing social networks in . the 16 to 24 age group, while just 1 in 100 of those aged 65 and over . did so. Looking . specifically at those aged 16 to 24, the UK has the joint fifth highest . proportion of social networkers in the EU - at 90 per cent.

'I was a founding member of the executive team when Gatehouse was set up and for over four years I committed a great deal of time and energy to trying to make it succeed. ‘The manner of my dismissal on holiday can only be described as an unnecessary and vindictive, and it leaves a very sour taste in my mouth.’ At an Employment Tribunal in London yesterday Mr Bagshawe, from Kent, admitted the bank had struggled as a result of the credit crunch and staff had been laid off. Despite Gatehouse never making a profit during the four years he spent at the bank Mr Bagshawe was paid more than £1m in salary and bonuses over the period. The bank operated under Sharia law, which has strict rules over issues such as charging interest on loans. He claimed his relationship with his bosses began to turn sour when he raised concerns about a proposed £100m investment from the Kuwaiti Investment Agency (KIA). He said the deal was done by the bank’s chairman, Fahed Boodai, and Mr Dhunnoo who was at the time his junior. He claimed he and other UK-based executives were kept in the dark about what was going on. 'Race discrimination': Investment banker Mr Bagshawe claims a Muslim employee took over his role at Gatehouse Bank after he was made redundant . He claims he raised concerns about the deal with the Financial Standards Authority which made him unpopular with the bank. Mr Bagshawe said: ‘I do not make an allegation of discrimination lightly. ‘However the fact remains that Mr . Boodai, as a Muslim, chose to involve Mr Dhunnoo, another Muslim, in the . KIA investment, to the exclusion of his UK based executive team, none . of whom are Muslim.’ Mr Bagshawe who has 25 years of . experience in banking working for JP Morgan and Flemings, is claiming to . be whistleblower and so can be awarded unlimited damages if he wins the . case. He claims Mr Dhunnoo should also have been considered for redundancy. Mr Bagshawe said: ‘Based on my . assessment of our respective experience and skills I did not see there . was any rational reason for the difference in treatment. ‘I remain of the view that my race, . nationality, ethnic background or religion or belief may have been a . factor in my dismissal, and do not believe that Gatehouse has provided . any evidence to rebut this view.’ Gatehouse Bank deny the allegations . and say Mr Bagshawe’s position remains redundant a year after he left . the company and there are no proposals to appoint a successor. It also claims the FSA did not . recognise his approach to them as ‘whistleblowing’ and that Mr Bagshawe . had agreed the KIA investment at a board meeting. They also say there is no evidence that Mr Bagshawe has been discriminated against because of his race or religion. The tribunal continues and is expected to last 12 days. Last night a spokesman for the bank . said: ‘Mr Bagshawe was made redundant by the CEO a Christian. His appeal . was heard by a non-executive director, another Christian. His . redundancy was supported by the Board comprised equally of Christians . and Muslims. ‘The Bank categorically denies that . there was any relationship whatsoever between Mr Bagshawe’s religion and . the decision to make him redundant. ‘As COO, Mr Bagshawe was well paid . during his 4 year term, earning in excess of £1million. Yet by December . 2010, during his tenure, the company was eroding £1million per month of . its working capital. ‘The company all but halved its . headcount from 40 in November 2009 to 25 in June 2011. Nonetheless, Mr . Bagshawe received an enhanced redundancy package and pay in lieu of . notice in compensation for his loss of office, equivalent to double the . average Londoner’s annual salary. ‘He was also entitled to keep over a third of a million shares. ‘Gatehouse Bank had, and has, a . diverse workforce including individuals who hold the Christian, Muslim . and Hindu faiths, among others. Claims that Mr Bagshawe has been . discriminated against or that he “blew the whistle” are strongly . contested.’","James Bagshawe was made redundant from .

"A female doctor says she left her comfortable middle class life in Malaysia to join the Islamic State - where she married a jihadi she had never before met and whose language she could not speak. Calling herself Shams, the 26-year-old has since kept an impassioned diary of the time she claims she spent in ISIS-held cities Taqba and Raqqa - updating a number of social media sites with florid descriptions of her marriage to a Morocco-born terrorist who uses the nom de guerre Abu Baraa. As well as posting detailed accounts of her day to day life as an a terror bride, Shams also posts words of encouragement for other young female fanatics thinking of joining ISIS - often updating her websites with chilling images, including one of a doctor's stethoscope wrapped around a rifle. Scroll down for video . Sick: This image Shams shared on social media is understood to show her and her ISIS jihadi husband Abu Baraa on their wedding day. Chillingly it is captioned: 'In the land of jihad...till martyrdom do us part' Armed and dangerous: Shams - who uses the Twitter name Bird of Jannah - has told her followers that she first travelled to Syria in February, adding that felt 'excitement' at the prospect of joining the terrorist group . Chilling: In August Shams uploaded this sickening photograph of a doctor's stethoscope wrapped around a large assault rifle. She described it as a 'selfie' of her and her terrorist husband . Shams has told her followers that she first travelled to Syria in February, adding that her emotions were at the time were a mixture of 'excitement' at the prospect of joining the terrorists and 'sadness' at the thought of leaving family members at home in Malaysia. She added that she can speak English, Urdu and Hindi, which has helped her fit in with the huge number of foreigners who have travelled to join ISIS without being able to speak Arabic. Her claims cannot be independently verified and she has not responded to contact on social media. Her marriage to Abu Baraa was arranged for her by another woman in April and, despite the couple not sharing a common language, Shams has written about their relationship in breathless phrases that wouldn't look out of place in a Mills and Boon novel. Jihadi bride: Sham's marriage to Abu Baraa was arranged in April and, despite the couple not sharing a common language, she has written about their relationship in breathless phrases . Describing their first meeting, she wrote: 'I was trembling. Nervous. Scared. My emotions were mixed. When he noticed my arrival, he gave salaam [said hello] and introduced himself, so did I. Then, it was a long awkward silence.' 'After few minutes, I flipped my niqab. He looked at me, our eyes catches each others. He smiled. And asked a question I shall never forget . . . 'Can we get married today?',' she added. Shams - who uses the Twitter handle @__birdofjannah - said the couple were married on the same day they met, but it took her a further 24 hours to 'fall in love'. Describing their praying together, Shams said: 'He turned back and smiled at me. And I can feel something. Yes, I guess I just fell in love with someone - my husband! She went on to say that the couple have since downloaded dictionary apps on their iPhones in order to communicate with one another. The majority of Sham's social media updates are syrupy phrases about her relationship with an ISIS fighter . The qualified doctor left her middle class life in Malaysia to join ISIS. She has since kept an impassioned diary of her time cities of Taqba and Raqqa, with many updates focussing on her marriage . However Shams is clearly aware of the potentially fleeting nature of a romance with a terrorist. On October 21 she wrote: I know for a fact that one day my husband will be a shaheed [martyr]... and I have to prepare for it.' Not that such matters worry her. In one image she uploaded a photograph  understood to show her and a bearded, tie-wearing Abu Baraa on their wedding day. Chillingly the image was captioned: 'In the land of jihad...till martyrdom do us part'. She later posted: 'I should learn to be positive and stay happy for the sake of my unborn baby.' In August, in a blog post claiming to tell 'the true story' of her life as a jihadi bride, Shams told her readers that she is taking some time off from her work as doctor  as she had been diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum. The illness is the same form of acute morning sickness that the Duchess of Cambridge has suffered from during both her pregnancies. Horror: Shams specialises in updating her social media sites with florid descriptions of her marriage to a Moroccan-born terrorist who uses the nom de guerre Abu Baraa . Warped: Shams says her parents are fully supportive of her decision to wage jihad. In fact she claims they have spent the past few months putting their affairs in order before they make the journey to join her in Syria . Shams claims that under the extreme interpretation of Islamic law practised in the areas of Syria and Iraq controlled by Iraq, she required her father's permission before being allowed to marry. Far from her family being horrified by her journeying to join the terror group, Shams said her parents are fully supportive of her decision to wage jihad. In fact she claims they have spent the past few months putting their affairs in order before they make the journey to join her in Syria. When asked her reasons for joining ISIS by one of her many followers on social media, she said she first travelled to Syria in order to use her medical expertise to treat wounded jihadis. Shortly after she uploaded a sickening photograph of a doctor's stethoscope wrapped around a large assault rifle, describing the image as a 'selfie' of her and her husband. In one of her most recent postings on Twitter, Shams wrote: 'A life without jihad is like drinking sea water. It keeps you thirsty & cause you dehydrated [sic]. That's the condition of our Ummah [international Muslim community] today.' The previous day she had posted: 'November is officially the month of martyrs, one after another, joining the smiling caravan.' Do you know Shams, also known as Bird of Jannah?

"With her stellar career, £7.3million salary, 34-year marriage and two much-loved children, there doesn’t seem to be much missing from Indra Nooyi’s life. But despite appearances, the CEO of PepsiCo insists that women can’t have it all – and can only ‘pretend’ to. Mrs Nooyi, who is ranked at number 13 on this year’s Forbes list of the world’s most powerful women, says she has sacrificed relationships to get ahead at work and ‘dies with guilt’ over the compromises she makes to balance her career with her family life. Scroll down for video . 'Women can't have it all': Indra Nooyi, CEO of PepsiCo, told those gathered at this week's Aspen Ideas Festival that it is nearly impossible for women to balance work and family without help . The 58-year-old even described enlisting her secretary to control how much time her daughters spent playing video games. She said: ‘I don’t think women can have it all, I just don’t think so. We pretend we have it all. We pretend we can have it all. ‘My husband and I have been married for 34 years. And we have two daughters. And every day you have to make a decision about whether you are going to be a wife or a mother. In fact, many times during the day you have to make those decisions. ‘And you have to co-opt a lot of people to help you. We co-opted our families to help us. We plan our lives meticulously so we can be decent parents. ‘But if . you ask our daughters, I’m not sure they will say that I’ve been a good . mom. I’m not sure. And I try all kinds of coping mechanisms. ‘You know, you have to cope, because you die with guilt.’ Family life: Indra poses with her husband Raj and their two daughters . Her comments echo those of Facebook CEO and mother-of-two Sheryl Sandberg, who said earlier this year that there is no such thing as a work-life balance, adding: ‘There’s work, and there’s life, and there’s no balance.’ At the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado, Mrs Nooyi, who studied business at Yale University, also suggested a woman’s ‘biological clock and career clock are in total, complete conflict with each other’. She said: ‘When you have to have kids, you have to build your career. Just as you’re rising to middle management, your kids need you because they’re teenagers. ‘The person who hurts the most through this whole thing is your spouse. There’s no question about it. You know, [my husband] Raj always said, you know what, your list is PepsiCo, PepsiCo, PepsiCo, our two kids, your mom, and then at the bottom of the list is me.’ Watch more at The Aspen Ideas Festival . On stage: Nooyi (left) made the remarks while being interviewed by David Bradley, owner of The Atlantic magazine . She joked: ‘There are two ways to look at it. You should be happy you’re on the list. So don’t complain. He is on the list. He is very much on the list.’ Mrs Nooyi also described how she needed to outsource parenting tasks to her receptionist to make sure her daughters did not spend too much time playing video games. She said: ‘I travel a lot, and when my kids were tiny, especially my second one, we had strict rules on playing Nintendo. She’d call the office, and she didn’t care if I was in China, Japan, India, wherever.’ The Pepsi boss said she gave her secretary a list of questions to ask her daughter before she could have permission to play the games. Wedding day: Indra Nooyi and Raj on their wedding day in 1980 . She explained: ‘She goes through the questions and she says, “Okay, you can play Nintendo half an hour.” Then she leaves me a message. “Tyra called at five. This is the sequence of questions I went through. I’ve given her permission.” So it’s seamless parenting. ‘But if you don’t do that, I’m serious, if you don’t develop mechanisms with your secretaries, with the extended office, with everybody around you, it cannot work. ‘You know, stay-at-home mothering was a full-time job. Being a CEO for a company is three full-time jobs rolled into one. How can you do justice to all?’","Indra Nooyi, 58, made the remarks at this week's Aspen Ideas Festival .

"Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard clung to her bodyguard as she was dragged to safety through a crowd of angry protesters in Canberra yesterday. Riot police formed a shield around the prime minister as they helped her force a path through the protesters who surrounded a restaurant where she was attending an awards ceremony to mark Australia Day.

The protests appear to have been aimed primarily at opposition leader Tony Abbott, who was also in the building when some 200 demonstrators began banging on its windows, shouting 'shame' and 'racist'.

Dozens . of extra police were called to the scene and . escorted them from the building after 20 minutes. Miss Gillard was unharmed and hosted another Australia Day function at her official residence in Canberra after the incident. Australia Day marks the arrival of the first fleet of British colonists in Sydney on January 26, 1788. Many Aborigines call it Invasion Day because the land was settled without a treaty with traditional owners. There have also been suggestions that the day be moved because it currently falls during school holidays. A different date would allow greater participation in the event among children.

"Police are to investigate claims that Sir Jimmy Savile and an accomplice ran a sex ring at the BBC. The Mail has been told that a BBC employee was allegedly given the task of procuring girls for the presenter and other men to molest. The member of staff sometimes attacked them himself, it is alleged. Gary Glitter has already been accused of being a member of the sex ring. 'Sex ring': Around 40 women have now come forward to allege that they were raped or molested by the late Jimmy Savile . Now two women have separately named the former BBC employee. One, a former beauty queen, claims she was raped by him on BBC premises. The second woman, Kim Anderson, claims Savile's alleged accomplice invited her on to a tour bus to meet the star when she was waitressing at a Marylebone drinking club as a 19-year-old. About 40 women have now stepped forward to allege they were raped or molested by the late Jim’ll Fix It star. As the crisis threatened to engulf the BBC, newly-appointed director general George Entwistle last night wrote to all his staff urging them to help the police. He promised: ‘I am absolutely determined that we will leave no stone unturned in our efforts to support the police. I know I can rely on your co-operation.’ Last night Savile’s alleged accomplice told the Mail: ‘Absolutely not’, when asked if he had committed rape. Until now, the corporation had assumed the star was working alone when he allegedly abused girls in the 1960s and 1970s. Yesterday the beauty queen - named only as Sandra - and Mrs Anderson independently named the BBC employee they say was working as an accomplice with the Jim’ll Fix It star. Their accounts follow earlier statements from women who say they saw Savile and others assaulting girls in his BBC dressing room. Former beauty queen Sandra (seen right in the 1970s) claims she was raped by a man tasked with procuring girls for Jimmy Savile (left) to molest . Sandra was 23 when she won a beauty contest and wrote to Savile asking for work experience – an offer he quickly took up. She said she was invited to Savile’s caravan in 1970, which he kept in the car park outside the BBC studios in West London. At the time, Savile worked for Radio One. After discussing her career, she says Savile started ‘to get heavy with her’. The pair had sex in the caravan on a double bed draped with a goat-skin rug. She said: ‘I certainly didn’t fancy him. I just thought “this might make me famous” – it all happened very quickly. I just thought he was a bit of a dirty old man.’ 'He quickly tried it on with me...before he forced me on to the carpet' Former beauty queen Sandra . But a week later, she received a call from Savile’s accomplice, inviting her back to the BBC. She said she attended a preview of The Man Who Haunted Himself, a movie starring Roger Moore, with Saville and the BBC worker. Afterwards, she was invited to the alleged accomplice’s BBC ‘office’ – which she described as more of a storeroom – and Savile ‘disappeared’. ‘He quickly tried it on with me, saying something like “let’s have a kiss and cuddle” before he forced me on to the carpet,’ said Sandra. She said he forced her on to her hands and knees and raped her on the floor of a storeroom, ignoring her repeated pleas for him to stop. ‘I remember him locking the door behind me which I thought was strange. It was at the BBC. All I can remember about it was he was very rough and forceful and it hurt a lot. I pleaded with him to stop, repeatedly saying “no” – but was just told to keep my voice down. There must have been people around because I could hear radio shows going on and he told me not to make any noise. I felt so dirty on the journey home afterwards. ‘There is no doubt in my mind that this was all planned – with him and Jimmy. Jimmy must have said something to him to make him think he could have sex with me as well. I didn’t understand it at the time but it is obvious now why he got me there.’ Accused: Sir Jimmy Savile (left) has been accused of sexually abusing girls during the '60s and '70s. Rocker Gary Glitter has already been implicated in the alleged sex ring . The second woman, Kim Anderson, was a . 19-year-old waitress at a drinking club in Marylebone who said she was . invited by Savile’s accomplice to meet the star on a tour bus. Mrs . Anderson, now 53, said the moment she arrived, she was ushered through a . curtained-off section at the back of the bus, where Savile was waiting. ‘I had to fight him off,’ she said. ‘Jimmy Savile was definitely trying . to have sex with me on the couch. I sat down to talk to him, and he . lunged at me. ‘He . wanted me to touch him, and he lunged at me and kissed me. I went back . out to where everyone was sitting and this [accomplice], who idolised . Jimmy Savile, told me to go back in there. I didn’t.’ Last night the Mail put the allegations in full to the former BBC employee. He . said of the rape allegation: ‘Absolutely not.’ He claimed he could not . remember a drinking club in Marylebone or Savile ever using a ‘tour . bus’. He said: ‘I haven’t got the greatest memory but I don’t remember . any of this. I can’t see why the accusations have been made. I have . never raped anyone in my life.’ He . added: ‘I knew Jimmy had girlfriends around the country – but I was . totally unaware of any under-aged children. Asked if he ‘idolised’ Savile he replied: ‘Yeah – I thought a lot about Jim.’ Last . night a BBC spokesman said: ‘This is another horrifying allegation and . we would urge anybody in possession of information of this sort to take . it to the police who are co-ordinating the investigation.’ BBC director general George Entwistle . sent an email to all BBC staff telling them ‘full co-operation’ with . the police was ‘vital’ and urging them to come forward. He said he was ‘absolutely determined’ in leaving ‘no stone unturned’ in its efforts to support the police investigation. Mr Entwistle, who met police yesterday, wrote to staff: ‘I wanted to write to you at the end of what has been a difficult week for the BBC, following allegations from a number of women that Jimmy Savile sexually abused them when they were young teenagers during the 1960s and 70s. ‘Like everyone who works here, I was appalled by the things I saw in the ITV documentary. I am determined that the corporation will do absolutely everything it can to help find out what happened.’ He added: ‘I want to make it clear that full co-operation with the police on this matter is vital. If any staff member past or present knows anything they think might help I would urge them to come forward.’ The BBC’s investigations unit is made up of former policemen and military staff, whose duties include the security of staff and the security of the corporation’s buildings. They are said to be carrying out ‘deep analysis’ of all the stored archives at the corporation from around the period. Sources said there was now a forensic examination of documents relating to BBC programmes going back for more than 40 years. Last night Jim Gamble, a former child protection police chief, told Channel 4 News that the Scotland Yard inquiry must identify those who were ‘complicit’ in the abuse and those who ‘conspired to cover it up’.","Former beauty queen claims she was raped in storeroom by Radio 1 DJ's 'apprentice'

"Suspects in the investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann will be questioned by police in Portugal this week, it has emerged . Suspects in the investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann will be questioned by police in Portugal this week, it emerged last night. Three Portuguese nationals and one Russian man will be interviewed in the Algarve region from today. The questioning follows a formal request by British police, who will sit in on the interview, but only Portuguese officers will ask questions. The Russian suspect lived in Praia da Luz when Madeleine disappeared. He was previously questioned by police during the first phase of the investigation by Portuguese police after Madeleine went missing in 2007 although he was never made a suspect. The suspects are attending ‘of their own free will’ and will be made ‘arguidos’ - people of interest - after they meet police. Eight witnesses are also due to be questioned at a police station in Faro. The interviews will take place over two or more days. Last month British police were involved in fingertip searches of sites around Praia da Luz as part of the British re-investigation into her disappearance. British officers, accompanied by their Portuguese counterparts, carried out searches earlier this month of three areas of land near to where Madeleine went missing. The McCann’s recently said in a statement: ‘We have always wanted all reasonable lines of inquiry to be followed. It is gratifying to know that a substantial amount of work is taking place with the close co-operation of the British and Portuguese authorities.’ Their spokesman Clarence Mitchell said last night: ‘Kate and Gerry will simply not comment on any aspect of Operation Grange. 'It is entirely a matter for the Met Police as to what they do and when they will do it.’ Scroll down for video . The apartment where the McCanns were staying with Madeleine when she disappeared . British officers, accompanied by their Portuguese counterparts, carried out searches earlier this month of three areas of land near to where Madeleine went missing from this apartment . A spokesperson for the Yard’s multi-million-pound inquiry, headed by Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, said they were moving to a new phase after negotiations with the Portuguese authorities. They have vowed to carry out ‘a substantial amount of work’ over the coming weeks and months in their bid to find out what happened to Madeleine.

The spectacular images can be viewed at his website Ed Drew Photography. Drew's images are the first combat zone tintype photos created since the Civil War . Drew said it was tough convincing his peers to sit through the tedious photo shoot . Drew was staff sergeant in the California Air National Guard and deployed to Helmand Province, Afghanistan, as a helicopter aerial gunner with a U.S. Air Force Combat Rescue Unit when he captured these images . Drew said taking tintype pictures in a war zone was 'historically significant' According to fstoppers.com, tintype 'is a slow, laborious wet plate process that is difficult to master and work with in warm temperatures'. Introduced in the mid-nineteenth century, this artistic process was used to document the Civil War. It involves hand-pouring a collodion mixture onto a metal plate, which is then made light sensitive in a darkroom via a silver nitrate solution. The plate, encased in a light-tight film holder, is exposed to light in camera and then must be processed within ten minutes of exposure. For Drew, the unique artistic process helped him work through his own involvement in the war. 'As a photographer and artist I wanted to achieve something that was physical, one of a kind and very unique,' he told PetaPixel. 'I believe in the Japanese aesthetic of 'Wabi-Sabi' so the idea that something is imperfect and impermanent interests me. 'I . wanted that to translate in my Afghan images as metaphors for what I . experienced in the war, I thought tintypes to be the perfect . photographic process to translate Wabi Sabi in my portraits.' The stresses of combat, lack of basic materials, drying desert air, and the wind and dust of Afghanistan challenged Drew's artistic ability . While Drew's peers were initially reluctant to sit for him, they went back for more after seeing the incredible results . Drew photographed his fellow soldiers in the front of the Air Force rescue helicopters they flew . Drew chose tintype photography because he 'wanted to do a process that was historical, but also made me take my time and work slowly to focus on my subject.' But convincing his peers to sit for a formal portrait was tough, with many frustrated with the painstaking process. 'Initially, I really had to convince them to do it,' Drew told fstoppers.com. 'I work with these guys, but they know me as a gunner. 'After they started seeing how amazing the plates looked, they began booking appointments. 'One . of the guys I flew with is the great great grandson of Buffalo Bill so . he asked for a photo just like his grandfather. It was one of my best . plates.' Drew's photographic goal was to 'show the humanity of war in the eyes of airmen I fly combat missions with.' Not since Matthew Brady¿s work documenting the Civil War has the tintype photographic process been used on the battlefield . Drew gave everyone who sat for him a high resolution scan and a print to thank them for participating . Taking photos during an active mission meant Drew often had to 'drop everything' and jump in a helicopter . Drew's Afghan images were 'metaphors' for what he experienced in the war . Drew said switching 'thought process, from creative to tactical' was difficult, as he had to make sure he maintained his 'situational awareness' For Drew, the photos helped him to document his 'life in the aftermath of my deployment'","U.S. Air Force aerial gunner Ed Drew photographed his peers during the Afghanistan war to show their humanity .

"The All Blacks are used to being on the receiving end of some dubious tackles, but when they come from airline cabin crew and not the opposing team, it’s another thing altogether. It looks like Air New Zealand off-duty cabin crew could face time in the sin-bin after some became drunk and cuddled All Black players on a flight home from the United States. It may turn out to be a red card offence as the crew are now under investigation by Air New Zealand after Thursday’s NZ1 flight from Los Angeles, which brought the All Blacks home from their northern hemisphere tour, the Sunday Star Times reports. Scroll down for video . All Blacks centre Conrad Smith had more to handle than a ball on a flight back to New Zealand on Thursday . In a new twist on coming in on the wrong side of the ruck, one of the off-duty crew allegedly became drunk and abused the operating cabin crew, while a second was also drunk and ‘cuddling’ a player. News.com.au reported that Leeanne Langridge, general manager cabin crew for Air New Zealand, confirmed on Sunday that seven off-duty cabin crew were travelling back to Auckland as passengers on the flight from Los Angeles, which landed on Thursday morning. New Zealand captain Richie McCaw keeps an eye out for cuddling cabin crew . ‘There was a suggestion that some of the crew travelling back to New Zealand as passengers may have consumed too much alcohol and the matter is currently under investigation,' she said. 'Given this is an employment issue, Air New Zealand will not be commenting further.' Drunk off-duty Air New Zealand cabin crew gave the All Blacks squad a flight to remember . At least the encounter didn't go into extra time as the New Zealand team had expanded enough energy as it was on their northern hemisphere tour where they beat Wales 34-16 in the bear pit atmosphere of the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff after defeating England 24-21 and Scotland 24-16 over the previous two weekends.

"Health campaigners last night demanded a full-scale inquiry into the meltdown in the Labour-run Welsh NHS. The Daily Mail has uncovered appalling cases of patients dying while on waiting lists or being forced to move to England for life-saving treatment. Over the next few days, our investigation will expose horrifying neglect and a political establishment in denial. Scroll down for video . Health campaigners have demanded an investigation into the Labour-run Welsh NHS. Ed Miliband intends to place running NHS at heart of Labour's election campaign next May - despite the party's dismal record . Despite his party’s dismal record in Wales, Ed Miliband wants to place the running of the NHS at the heart of Labour’s election campaign next May. Yet families whose loved ones have suffered in Welsh hospitals say the situation is even worse than the Mid Staffordshire scandal. The British Medical Association, the Conservatives, Plaid Cymru nationalists and Labour MP Ann Clwyd are all demanding an independent inquiry. And a survey out today shows that seven out of ten voters agree. The Mail’s investigation will reveal that: . Yesterday another scandal erupted at the Glan Clwyd Hospital in Rhyl, North Wales, where police are investigating claims that staff used furniture to restrain dementia patients. The British Medical Association warned last month that the NHS in Wales was facing ‘imminent meltdown’ and called for an independent investigation. Last year the College of Emergency Medicine wrote to the Welsh health minister warning that casualty units were putting patients at risk. Labour MP Ann Clwyd is among those demanding an independent inquiry into the situation in hospitals . And Sir Bruce Keogh of NHS England wrote to his Welsh counterpart last November warning six hospitals should be probed over ‘persistently high’ mortality rates. Today’s survey, commissioned by the Welsh Conservatives, found that a third of people with recent experience of hospital treatment had encountered problems and nearly one in five felt their concerns were not taken seriously. It found that 71 per cent back an independent inquiry into the NHS and 60 per cent believe their health service has deteriorated over the past five years. Respondents included a retired nurse who complained that senior managers were too afraid to act on bad practice. An orthopaedic consultant who answered the questionnaire said Wales’s NHS was ‘on the verge of becoming a third-world health service’. The research was based on 3,295 responses to a survey posted online and sent to 5,000 homes chosen at random. Gareth Williams has campaigned to expose failings at the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University health board in South Wales after his mother Lilian suffered neglect before her death in hospital. ‘I believe the indifference of government ministers in Cardiff is callous,’ said the 54-year-old retired teacher. ‘They can no longer hold up the pretence that there are only isolated concerns in ABMU or Wales. In Wales we are still in denial. I think we are where England was when the Mid Staffs scandal broke.’ Hundreds of patients died through neglect at Stafford Hospital. Mr Williams said he and fellow campaigners have been contacted by seven whistleblower nurses. Miss Clwyd has described how her husband died like a ‘battery hen’ at University Hospital Wales in October 2012. She highlighted high mortality rates at some Welsh hospitals and long waiting times for diagnostic tests. A scandal erupted at the Glan Clwyd Hospital in Rhyl, North Wales, yesterday where police are investigating claims that staff used furniture to restrain dementia patients . A spokesman for the Cardiff administration said: ‘The vast majority of people in Wales receive excellent care from our NHS, which is more open, transparent and is subjected to a higher level of scrutiny than any other health service in the UK. If issues are identified, we work quickly to put them right.’ A spokesman for the ABMU health board said: ‘The vast majority of patients receive good quality care – our complaints rate over the past year was 0.15 per cent – but we know that any poor care is unacceptable and we are determined to put things right.’","Daily Mail has uncovered appalling cases of patients dying on waiting lists .

"Parents have been warned of the dangers of a simple new device freely available online which heats alcohol and allows it to be inhaled - reportedly giving the user an instant but intense high. Released in December, the $35 Vaportini acts in a manner similar to a traditional vaporizer, heating and releasing intoxicating vapors which are breathed through a straw after being heated by a candle to 140 Fahreneheit. Bypassing the digestive system, the Vaportini causes alcohol to be ingested directly to the bloodstream through the lungs, potentially causing dangerous levels of intoxication - especially if abused. The Vaportini is available to buy all across the United States and is legal according to its creators . 'It is ill advised for . experimentation among those under 21,' said Dr. Thomas Greenfield, Center Director at the . National Alcohol Research Center in Emeryville, California. 'There could be inexperienced . people at parties under peer pressure who may find themselves using this . method of alcohol consumption. 'It might not be possible to self-regulate their consumption and teenagers just like adults can be drunk drivers too.' Indicating that in research . laboratory's rats have been known to be more perceptible to alcohol . addiction through inhalation, Dr. Greenfield warned of the dangers of . this particular method of consumption. 'To my knowledge there have been no human studies on the effects inhaling alcohol,' said Dr. Greenfield. 'Certainly in lab rats they have . experimented with vapor chambers and the animals experimented upon have . high levels of intoxication and addiction.' The Vaportini was created by Julie Palmer back in 2009, but it went on sale on her website for $34.50 each in December . As with any excessive use of alcohol, . Greenfield said that teens especially risked harming their own mental . development with abuse. 'In early adolescence, the brain is . not as formed and too much alcohol risks affecting its formation,' explained Dr. Greenfield.' The device which its creators say is . legal, bares striking similarities to the notorious Alcohol without . Liquid device (AWOL) which mechanically vaporizes alcohol shots over the . course of 20 minutes and is banned in 22 states. Invented by Chicago resident Julie . Palmer in 2009, the simple glass and metal device is offered as a . novelty method to consume drinks at the bar she owns in the Windy City, . Red Kiva. The Vaportini works differently to the more traditional consumption of alcohol. The Vaportini transfers alcohol directly from the lungs to the bloodstream - increasing the levels of intoxication . Normally, when a drink is taken, alcohol is absorbed 10 percent through the stomach and 85 percent in the small intestine. The . presence of food slows this process further, but when alcohol is . inhaled, however, alcohol enters the lungs and goes directly into the . bloodstream, causing a much more rapid and stronger buzz. However, unlike the AWOL device which retails online in the U.S. for around $250, the Vaportini does not promise zero side effects and explicitly tells users that 'alcohol consumed through a Vaportini will be detected by a blood alcohol test.' Over 20 states banned the AWOL device, which was first introduced into the United States in 2004/5, amid much concern and controversy. The glass globe of the Vaportini is filled with a shot of liquor and put on top of a pint glass.The heat from a tea-light candle in the bottom of the pint glass turns the alcohol gaseous inside the globe.One reviewer from Time Out Chicago said: 'I stick the straw through a small hole in the globe and suck in a drag of invisible Knob Creek bourbon fumes. It’s warm, retains its flavor and gives an instant, though brief, buzz.'Palmer herself says: 'The intention is not to replace drinking.'However, she says, 'If the Vaportini doesn’t take off, we should market it to stoners as the Vodka Bong.' 'When you inhale alcohol right into the lung tissue, that gets drawn right into the blood supply immediately, so it's a very rapid onset of the intoxicating effect, and so has obviously very high abuse potential,' said Robert Walker of the University of Kentucky Center on Drugs and Alcohol Research at the time to the New York Times. Kevin Morse, president of Spirit Partners in Greensboro, N.C., which markets the devices, known as Alcohol Without Liquid, or AWOL, said they were harmless. 'At the end of the day, it’s just a new way for adults to enjoy alcohol in a different manner,' said Mr. Morse. The . danger of vaporized alcohol entering the bloodstream directly as . opposed to the digestive system means that protective impulses - such as . vomiting - are bypassed. In . fact, it is the swift infusion of alcohol to the brain that makes . inhalation more addictive than regular drinking according to scientists. Robert Swift, a professor of psychiatry at Brown Medical School told Slate.com that when researchers want to model alcohol addiction in rats they often expose them to air mixed with vaporized alcohol. When the AWOL device was released in the United States, it was banned by 22 states concerned that it would encourage reckless drinking . The AWOL claims to vaporize a single measure of liquor over the course of 20 minutes and the makes say it should not be used more than twice in 24 hours . This is a standard test because it is hard to get rats to drink alcohol, but the desired dependence they seek for their results comes within a matter of days using vapor. 'It's a good way to addict animals,' said Swift.","New device allows the user to directly inhale alcohol - increasing the effects on the body .
Experts have warned that the Vaportini - which is available to buy online - could be used by impressionable and inexperienced teenagers ."
"An early version of the ‘King’s Speech’ reveals Britain was preparing to declare war on Germany before Hitler invaded Poland. George VI’s address to the nation, depicted in the 2010 movie starring Colin Firth as the stammering monarch, had been written at least nine days beforehand. The three-page document that has come to light is entitled ‘Draft King’s Speech’ and is dated August 25, 1939. This early draft of the King's Speech, announcing the outbreak of war, was written at least nine days before George VI addressed the nation . The document, which was written on August 25, 1939 - seven days before Germany’s invasion of Poland - has come to light after 74 years. The typed document, the second draft of the speech, was retained by civil servant Harold Vale Rhodes, who had previously written a first attempt. In a pencilled note in the left-hand margin, Mr Rhodes criticised the length of some of the sentences in the second draft and hinted that his should be used. It would appear his advice was followed - the final speech read to the nation and the Commonwealth by the King on September 3 contained shorter, more concise sentences. Although the tone remained the same, some of the content was significantly different. For instance, it did not mention Germany or Hitler by name but merely 'our enemies’. The early draft accused Germany of being a bully that wanted to dominate the world by brute force and stressed that 'we are fighting for the principles of freedom and justice'. The address was delivered by King George VI (left) on September 3, 1939, after Hitler's Germany had invaded Poland. It was depicted in the 2010 film, The King's Speech, which starred Colin Firth (right) as King George VI . In the Oscar-winning film, Colin . Firth's royal character was given little time to prepare for his . defining address to the nation but in reality it appears the speech was . being readied for him more than a week beforehand. The rejected draft was acquired by the unnamed owner in a load of paperwork from Mr Rhodes' estate following his death in 1970. It has now been put up for sale at auction with a pre-sale estimate of £4,000. Dr Gabriel Heaton, of Sotheby's, which is selling the speech, said: ‘This is a fascinating document for a number of reasons. ‘It brings to life not just the speech, but a pivotal moment in British history. ‘It was written before Poland had been invaded but at a time when it was clear we were moving towards war with Germany. ‘It shows that something was being prepared days in advance of the declaration of war so that the monarch had a speech ready in order to speak to the nation and the Commonwealth.' He added: ‘You get a sense of the preparations for the speech and the struggle to find the right words to prepare the nation for the terrible fight that lay ahead. The three-page second draft, uncovered after 74 years, is to be auctioned by Sotheby's next month . ‘There would have been a group of people writing this speech and Rhodes was one of them. ‘He . had provided a first draft and was sent this revised version. His note . in the margin is saying that his original is better than this one and . that the wording should be shorter. ‘The . final version was a lot clearer. The sentences were shorter and the . structure was simpler and that is what you want for public speaking, . especially when the speaker has a speech impediment.’ Nigel Steel, a historian at the Imperial War Museum, said: ‘When it happened, war wasn't out of the blue. ‘There had been a number of political crises involving Germany going on for over a year before. ‘The idea that this speech was prepared in advance of war is not a huge surprise, especially as the King had difficulties in delivering speeches.’ The auction takes place at Sotheby's in London on December 10.","Document, announcing the outbreak of World War II, shows Britain was ready to declare war on Germany a week before Hitler invaded Poland .

"As a tribute to the five siblings killed in a tragic Texas trailer park fire, a local artist has stepped up and donated his time in crafting a set of personalized caskets for the children. Siblings Noah, 15; Nicholas, 13; Julian, 9; Areyanah, 6; and Lilyana, 5, Ortiz died early Tuesday after their 70-foot mobile home in Edna, Texas was engulfed in flames. Their father Johnny Hernandez Jr was able to get wife Annabel and their 4-year-old son Johnny III out of the house in time, but unfortunately the five other children became trapped and perished inside. Scroll down for video . In memoriam: Local artist Trey Ganem designed caskets for five siblings who were victims of a mobile home fire in Edna, Texas, designing caskets based on the characters from Frozen for the two young girls . When local artist, and former hot rod designer, Trey Ganem found out about the disaster, he immediately volunteered to make the caskets free of charge and the community raised the funds to pay for the materials. 'We want it to be more of a celebration of that person's life,' Ganem told KHOU.  '(We want) to give them a little bit of peace, that those were his babies. That represents my baby. That's not just another box.' Oldest son Noah, who played on the Edna High School football team, got a casket with his jersey number, school colors a and will have his helmet adhered to the coffin. Nicholas was a gamer, so Ganem made him a Call of Duty-themed casket. Julian's love of WWE professional wrestling is shown on his coffin. Little sisters Areyanah and Lilyana, meanwhile, received 'Frozen' themed coffins designed for each of the royal sisters in the hit Disney movie. Ganem constructed and painted the five coffins in four days , and showed the gifts to their parents on Friday. Tragedy: Noah Ortiz, 15, (back center) and his siblings Nicholas, 13, (right) Julian, nine, (left) Ariana, six (front left) and Liliana, five (center) have perished in a fire. Their brother Johnny (front right) survived . Designer: Ganem had worked for years as a hot rod designer and used his background to craft caskets that reflected each victim's life, putting a WWE design on Julian's . School pride: For Noah, who played varsity football at Edna High School, Ganem designed a casket with the school logo and Noah's number . Ganem was originally going to create the coffins at cost, but the caskets are now going free to the victims' family after the community stepped in to pay the entire cost of materials. 'This community has pulled together like none that I've seen for this family,' Ganem said. As of Saturday night, a separate online fund raised $50,000. Witnesses to the blaze told Click2Houston that they heard the distraught father shouting 'I tried to get in there! I tried, I tried!' outside the home. 'We're taking it really hard,' the father's brother, Rico Hernandez, told the Advocate. 'It's probably one of the biggest tragedies in Edna, in all around.' The cause of the fire is being investigated, although authorities have said it appears the flames started in the kitchen. 'It was an old trailer so maybe it was something electrical,' Rico Hernandez told the Advocate. 'I'm guessing it was cold last night so something with the heater.' Survivors: The children's parents, Johnny Hernandez, 30, and Annabel Ortiz, 32, also survived the fire . Heartbreaking: The siblings, pictured together, were unable to escape when the home partially collapsed . Artist: The designer, Trey Ganem, felt his job was to bring a sense of comfort to the grieving family, the community raised funds to pay for materials . Photographs taken of the two- or three-bedroom home on Tuesday show it completely burned down. By the time emergency services arrived, it was already completely engulfed in flames. Ortiz was taken to Citizens Medical Center, where she was listed in fair condition. She was treated for a gash to her arm, which she reportedly sustained when her husband pushed her from a window. Her husband and their surviving son did not need medical attention. Hernandez Jr.'s cellphone was found outside the house, the Advocate reported. He had taken photos of his children on Monday night and wanted to make sure he saved the images, his brother said. Destroyed: Firefighters sift through the charred remains of a mobile home where the five children perished . Scene: The 70-foot-long home was completely destroyed by the fire that broke out just after 5am . Questions: Authorities are still looking into what caused the fire at the mobile home in Edna, Texas . 'All of them were just popular, great kids,' Superintendent Robert O'Connor told The L.A. Times. 'It's devastating anytime you lose a child ... but to lose five at a one time, that is unbelievable.' Edna is a town of 5,500 residents about 100 miles southwest of Houston. The high school, where Noah was a starter for the football team, has canceled upcoming sports games and brought in grief counselors across its campuses.","Trey Ganem, who is also a hot rod designer, created five custom caskets for children who died in a mobile home fire .

"Drugs paraphernalia will be given to heroin addicts for free by the government in a bid to deter them from injecting the substance. Users will be given free foil to help them heat up the class-A drug in an attempt to encourage them to inhale it and thereby avoid the risks of contracting diseases such as HIV. Aluminium foil is used to warm heroin and breathe in its fumes to get high. Heroin addicts are to be given foil for free in a bid to encourage them to inhale the drug and reduce the risk of diseases such as HIV . Under current laws health professionals are banned from giving out foil to addicts, but the new rules, thought up by the Home Office, would end this practice. The scheme is likely to draw criticism from anti-drugs campaigners for fear it could encourage people to take drugs. Crime Prevention Minister Norman Baker said: ‘By allowing foil to be legally provided by healthcare professionals we are taking another positive step in reducing the number of individuals, families and communities whose lives are destroyed by drugs. ‘The decision was made on the condition that it is part of structured efforts to get individuals off drugs and will minimise the risk of spreading viruses like HIV, while encouraging more addicts to engage with support services. ‘It is also part of a range of work the coalition government is doing to reduce and prevent illegal drug use - helping dependent individuals through treatment, educating young people about the risks and supporting law enforcement in tackling the illicit trade.’ Crime Prevention Minister Norman Baker, pictured, said allowing foil to be legally provided will reduce the number of people whose lives are destroyed by drugs . Professor Les Iversen, former chairman of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, first made calls in 2010 for foil to be given to addicts to deter them from injecting. Schemes which give drug users safe places to inject and dispose of needles cleanly are already run in areas with high heroin usage. The scheme would cost £72 per addict per year, as opposed to the £84 per addict per year currently spent on providing clean needles. It comes as recent figures suggest nearly 300,000 people in the UK still use heroin and crack cocaine.","Scheme is to encourage addicts to inhale the drug and reduce risk of HIV .

"A glamorous black firearms officer in line for substantial compensation over racist discrimination has been arrested for alleged assault. PC Carol Howard, 35, is at the centre of two separate police investigations,  it can be revealed. The elite Diplomatic Protection Group officer, who was Scotland Yard’s Olympic Games security poster girl, has been arrested three times, including twice for allegedly assaulting a man. PC Carol Howard, left, 35, from Coulsdon, Surrey, who won an employment tribunal against the Met Police earlier this week, pictured right, is under investigation for  a series of allegations, including assault, harassment and possession of an indecent image of a child . One of the arrests, believed to be linked to her personal life, is understood to have taken place at a South London police station where her former husband, also an officer, is based. The single mother-of-two has not carried a gun since August last year and was suspended from duty in April after the latest alleged attack. The Daily Mail can reveal Miss Howard is under investigation for assault, harassment, making threats to damage property, perverting the course of justice, witness intimidation and possession an indecent image of a child. If found guilty, she has been warned her actions could end her police career. However her lawyer last night said the arrest smacked of victimisation. Miss Howard, who is a martial arts fan and fitness fanatic, won an employment tribunal against the Met earlier this week after being bullied for a year by a senior officer. The judges ruled she was the victim of sexual and racial discrimination while working in the DPG unit, which is dominated by white men. Miss Howard became a high-profile figure after she was picked to appear . in a glossy magazine photo shoot to highlight the diversity of police in London . But it can now be revealed that Miss Howard is herself under criminal investigation. Sussex Police continue to investigate her after she was arrested on August 29, 2013, on suspicion of assault, harassment and making threats to damage property. She was arrested again on a later date on suspicion of perverting the course of justice, witness intimidation and possession of an indecent image of a child under 16. Last night, Sussex Police said no further action was being taken over the allegation of assault but inquiries continued on the other matters. The Met is also investigating after she was arrested on suspicion of assault a second time on April 22 in Sutton, South London. As a result of this arrest, Miss Howard, who lives in Coulsdon, South London, and has served with the Met for more than ten years, was suspended from duty. Miss Howard will answer bail next month, but colleagues fear that whatever the outcome of the criminal inquiries the arrests could signal the end of her police career. One said: ‘Even if everything goes her way and is dropped, the simple fact of the arrests could be seen as bringing the service into disrepute.’ Miss Howard became a high-profile figure after she was hand-picked by chiefs to appear in a glossy magazine photo shoot to stress the diversity of policing in the capital. A Met spokesman confirmed that Miss Howard was suspended from duty on April 30 ‘following her arrest as part of ongoing criminal investigations’. Miss Howard’s lawyer Kiran Daurka, of Slater & Gordon, said: ‘Against the background of the employment tribunal’s findings about the conduct of the Met towards PC Howard, this latest development can be seen as victimisation against our client by the Met. ‘We are considering the position and will be advising our client as to any further legal action. She continues to have the support of the Police Federation and the Metropolitan Police Federation.’ Last night Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe defended his force’s record on race. But asked about Miss Howard’s arrests, he added: ‘I’m not prepared at all to discuss this separate, irrelevant issue.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","PC Carol Howard featured in glossy shoot to represent diversity in police .

One theory is this could make the post more attractive for candidates such as Lord Coe – who may have been deterred by the requirement to work three to four days per week (12 to 16 days per month). But in the past week it has changed to state: ‘Suitable candidates able to offer a lesser time commitment will also be considered.’ The deadline for applications was already extended by a week and closes today. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport, which is overseeing the appointment, announced last night that Sir Jeremy would be ‘representing the Government’ in the selection process. Alongside him will be former BBC executive Carolyn Fairbairn, who now works for ITV, and an independent peer, Lord Kakkar. Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy has been associated with a range of controversies over his career, earning him the nickname Sir Cover-up. Most recently, he vetoed the release to the Chilcot inquiry of letters and records of phone calls between Tony Blair and George Bush in the run-up to the Iraq war. The . contents of 150 messages - believed to reveal the real reason the former . prime minister dragged Britain into the conflict - will be censored. Sir Jeremy, 52, was also responsible for the first, bungled Downing Street response to the Plebgate scandal. BBC insiders last night questioned why he has been asked to help choose the next Trust chairman. The move to lighten the next BBC Trust chairman's workload has sparked speculation that the Government is hoping to lure Lord Coe, pictured, to the post . One said: ‘Jeremy Heywood has no background in media. On the surface this seems an odd appointment.’ When Lord Patten was chosen in 2011, the interview panel comprised ex-BP chief Lord Browne, ex-ITN chief Stewart Purvis, and DCMS permanent secretary Jonathan Stephens. The move to lighten the next chairman’s workload has sparked speculation that the Government is hoping to lure Lord Coe, who it had been thought would struggle to juggle the role if he becomes president of the International Association of Athletics Federations. Acting BBC Trust chairman Diane Coyle is the only publicly confirmed candidate. Labour MP Ben Bradshaw, of the Commons culture, media and sport select committee, which will have a hearing to vet the Government’s preferred candidate, said of the change to the job description: ‘It gives the impression government have already made up their mind about who they want but that person can’t commit the time so they are moving the goal posts. To do this so last minute and with no transparency is extremely alarming.’ A spokesman for the Commissioner for Public Appointments said the changes to the job description had been cleared by public appointments assessor Mark Addison.","Sir Jeremy Heywood part of three-strong interview panel for £110,000 post .

"Craig Carth, 27, was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm after he punched a four-year-old girl in her stomach . A man who punched a four-year-old girl so hard he ripped holes in her intestine and left her fighting for her life in intensive care has been jailed for 13 years. Craig Carth, 27, from south-west London, was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm after an investigation established the girl's injury was the result of a blow to her stomach. The four-year-old was rushed to St George's Hospital in Tooting after her mother called 999 in March 2013 to say she had been vomiting, Kingston Crown Court heard. During surgery she was found to have two holes in the front wall of the intestine. The attack was believed to have taken place at some point in the 48 hours before she was taken to hospital. She remained in intensive care for several days but has since made a full recovery. Carth was arrested, along with another man and two women, but he was not charged until February this year. The three other defendants were found not guilty of causing or allowing the serious harm of a young child. Detective Sergeant Tariq Farooqi, of Wandsworth Child Abuse Investigation Team, said: 'This is a substantial sentence and I am pleased that Carth will now be in prison for a significant amount of time. I'm glad that the weight of evidence helped the jury come to a unanimous finding of guilt against Carth. 'Had it not been for the excellence of the consultant paediatric surgeon and staff at St George's Hospital, this young girl may well have died. Thankfully she has made a full recovery. 'Officers from the Child Abuse Investigation Team conducted a thorough investigation, dealing with a very young, vulnerable child. 'We will continue to investigate every allegation of child abuse professionally in order to bring this type of dangerous offender to justice.' The 27-year-old was jailed for 13 years after a three week trial at Kingston Crown Court (pictured)","Craig Carth, 27, was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm .

"Springwatch star Michaela Strachan was hailed as inspirational yesterday for speaking about the trauma of undergoing a double mastectomy . Springwatch star Michaela Strachan was hailed as inspirational yesterday for speaking about the trauma of undergoing a double mastectomy. The Springwatch star was told that she had breast cancer following a routine mammogram in February this year. Yesterday she spoke publicly for the first time about her diagnosis and treatment and the prospect she now faces of having reconstructive surgery. In an emotional interview Ms Strachan, 48, told how she now feels she has a job to do in encouraging other women to make sure they attend regular screenings to check for the disease. Surgeons advised her to opt for a double mastectomy, the same procedure that Angelina Jolie also underwent last year, as there was a significant risk that her lobular cancer, which began in a gland that makes milk, might spreading from one breast to the other. Yesterday she used Twitter to publicise the story and to announce that has taken up the role of ambassador for a leading breast cancer charity. She wrote: ‘Today I become an ambassador for @BreakthroughBC to encourage women to have regular mammograms. ‘This year has been a challenging one. In Feb I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I was lucky, I found it early.’ The response from those reading her story was immediate and almost universal and she was inundated with messages of support and appreciation of her bravery. Chris Askew, Chief Executive at Breakthrough Breast Cancer led the way saying he believed she would ‘inspire and unit people’ facing the disease. He said: ‘We are honoured to welcome Michaela on board as a Breakthrough Breast Cancer ambassador. Michaela has been so brave in coming forward to share this authentic and inspiring account of her breast cancer journey. ‘By sharing her story, Michaela is raising awareness of the devastation that breast cancer causes to families from every walk of life. ‘Michaela is so well-loved by the public, and we hope she will inspire and unite people to support Breakthrough, and take us closer to the day we are able to stop breast cancer for good.’ Kate Macrae, a wildlife photographer who has worked on Springwatch, described Michaela as ‘a truly inspirational, strong and wonderful woman.’ On Twitter fans of her many shows were quick to commend her bravery and the awareness her story will bring. Michaela is pictured here with fellow Springwatch presenters Chris Packham (left) and Martin Hughes-Games . Sarah Robinson said: ‘So glad you have made full recovery. Well done on raising awareness on this vile disease.’ Sarah-Jane Phillips, from Bedfordshire, added: ‘Such an all too familiar story and a really brave lady for sharing her story as it really does encourage others.’ While Susan Brewer, from Essex, said: ‘What a brave lady Michaela Strachan is. Fighting breast cancer, having the guts to tell her story. Inspirational.’ But it was clear the decision to go public was not one that Ms Strachan took lightly, writing yesterday in the Mail on Sunday she spoke of how she agonised about whether she should speak out about her illness. She wrote: ‘I decided to make my story public and become an ambassador for Breakthrough Breast Cancer, a cutting-edge research charity working to stop breast cancer for good, in the hope that I can be an inspiration to other women who find themselves at the start of this frightening journey. The TV presenter, pictured with son Ollie, right, said: 'I thought hard about telling my story, because I don’t want to be labelled' ‘I can remind them about the importance of having regular mammograms. ‘If I’d put mine off, my story could have been a very different one. As it is, I’ve had a tough year and an emotional journey, but I’m not fighting for my life. ‘I thought hard about telling my story, because I don’t want to be labelled. For years I’ve carried the label ‘ex-anorexic’; no doubt that will now change to ‘breast cancer patient’. ‘But we all have challenges to face in our lives. We all have curve balls thrown at us.’ The public benefit of celebrities sharing their health scares, especially with regards to cancer has a well proven track record. Last year Angelina Jolie revealed she had chosen to undergo a double mastectomy after testing positive for a gene mutation that increases the risk of developing breast cancer by 87 per cent. The result was dubbed the ‘Angelina Jolie effect’ and saw rates of NHS referrals for the same tests double as women rushed to take the same precautions.","Springwatch star was diagnosed with cancer following routine mammogram .

"A woman has been charged with the murder of a pensioner just weeks after he appeared in court charged with child sex offences. Mike Pleasted, 77, was knifed in the chest during an attack at his home. Paramedics tried to resuscitate him but he died at the scene. The attack – in the early hours of Saturday – came two weeks after Pleasted appeared at Snaresbrook Crown Court in east London over sexual offences. A 31-year-old woman appeared at Thames Magistrates Court today charged with killing Mr Pleasted. She is also charged with  possession of an offensive weapon. Detectives said Mr Pleasted was stabbed in the chest in his flat in an eight-storey block in this street in Silvertown, east London . At his court appearance earlier this month, Pleasted stood charged with two counts of sexual assault on someone under the age of 18 and was bailed to return to the court in February. Neighbours claimed several children had been seen going into Mr Pleasted’s flat, which is in an eight-storey block in Silvertown, east London. Residents said the pensioner and a local woman were in a dispute over the latter’s son. One said: ‘I was speaking to neighbours after it happened and they told me that he apparently liked little boys. ‘I did see young boys going up to his flat, but I had just thought they were his grandchildren.’ Another neighbour said Mr Pleasted had told her that he had been warned by police not to approach children. She added: ‘He had an ongoing dispute with a woman, apparently about him and little boys. I don’t know if it’s her that’s been arrested. I was told by one of my neighbours he was well known as a bit of a paedophile. A police spokesman confirmed that Mr Pleasted was known to the suspect. Detectives are now trying to trace relatives of the bachelor who had lived alone in the third-floor flat for 15 years. One resident claimed that Mr Pleasted told her that police had ordered him not to approach anyone under the age of 18. A 31-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of murder and police are not looking for anyone else in connection with this incident. File picture . The woman in her 30s, who also asked not to be named, said: 'He has been arrested a few times, I've been told. 'He actually told me himself that he was not to speak to anyone under the age of 18. He was not to be seen with them or speak to them. 'That was last week sometime I think. He loved animals, so he came over to speak to me when I was walking my dog and that's when he told me. 'After the murder I was told by one of my neighbours that he was well known as a bit of a peadophile. 'I was shocked because I've known him to speak to and say 'hello' to for a long time and I never knew. 'But I was told by my neighbour that the parents who live around this area warn their children not to go up to his flat. I suppose I didn't know because I don't have any kids. 'I'm absolutely shocked. I was in shock all day on Saturday and I still am. Even if he did do those things, the person should have gone to the police and not done this. It's horrifying.' She added: 'He would talk to everyone and everyone knew him. He seemed friendly, and I think he was a bit lonely. 'From what he told me, he has a son who is a police officer and he has at least one grandchild, a little grandson.' A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Police were called to a residential address in Drew Road at 4.21am on Saturday November 29th following reports of a stabbing. 'Officers attended and found a 77-year-old man suffering from stab injuries to the chest. Paramedics attended and the man was pronounced dead at the scene. 'We are in the process of informing next-of-kin; formal identification awaits. A post-mortem examination will be held in due course. 'At this early stage, police are not looking for anyone else in connection with this incident.' He added: 'Although not related, the suspect and victim are believed to be known to each other.' Asked about the allegations that the victim was a suspected paedophile, the Yard spokesman added: 'We are retaining an open mind.'

"A nephew of Sir Jimmy Savile yesterday told how his celebrity uncle attended ‘paedophile parties’. Guy Marsden was just 13 when ‘Uncle Jimmy’ took him to a wealthy celebrity’s house in London in 1967 for the first of many sordid social gatherings. Over the next 18 months, Guy and his friends went to numerous ‘parties’ where he believes men sexually abused girls and boys as young as ten. Savile was at many of these events, he said. Guy Marsden, pictured left aged eight, and right aged 59 today, says when he was 13 his uncle Jimmy started taking him to 'paedophile parties' Guy and his teenage friends were used as ‘intermediaries’ to hang out with the younger victims. Guy, now 59, said the youngsters would disappear into the bedrooms with men and return later. He said there were ‘never any women’ at the parties and although he didn’t see any sexual abuse, it was ‘perfectly obvious’ what was happening. Several household names from the world of showbusiness were party regulars. Guy said Savile sometimes arrived with a man dressed as a priest and he believed the young victims may have come from an orphanage or children’s home. He has regularly spoken to friends about his experiences in the late 1960s, but no one took him seriously until this week’s revelations. ‘I have loved all this coming out about Jimmy and I feel guilty I didn’t do something about it earlier,’ he told the Mail yesterday. After Savile died last year, Guy was one of the relatives who publicly praised him. But he knew he was being a hypocrite. ‘I felt as low and as bad as you can get not saying anything.’ Other members of Savile’s family spoke out last week to condemn a TV programme alleging the DJ sexually abused teenage girls, but the nephew said many relatives were aware of his sordid past. The roofer from Leeds later married and he now has four children and ten grandchildren with his wife Anne. The late Jimmy Savile, pictured in the 1970's working as a porter at Leeds General Infirmary, has been accused by his nephew of attending parties in London attended by children as young as ten . But during his youth he was in and out of trouble and believes his seedy experiences in London were to blame for his problems. Guy came from a large family  – his mother, who was Savile’s sister, gave birth to ‘about 18’ children – and he grew up in a council house in Leeds. Uncle Jimmy was always the family celebrity. ‘It was like the Beatles coming to your house,’ recalled Guy. ‘He would drive us around in his Rolls-Royce and he gave us a colour television and a telephone.’ At 13, Guy and three friends hitch-hiked to London ‘for an adventure’. They returned home about five weeks later but regularly ran away to the capital for similar periods. On the first trip in 1967, the group of boys went to Euston Station and were quickly invited to a grubby flat by men who recognised them as easy prey, although Guy says he was never abused. ‘About four days later’, Jimmy Savile turned up at the flat where they were staying. ‘He recognised me and I thought “this is it, I’m going to get in big trouble here”. I hadn’t been in touch with my parents to tell them where I was. But Uncle Jimmy just took us away to a much better place.’ Savile turned up by coincidence at the address because he mixed with ‘fellow child molesters’, said Guy. The group of runaways ended up in a fabulous house – believed to belong to a famous pop impresario – with a big indoor swimming pool. The celebrity home was one of the party venues. ‘At night you would get about 15 or 20 people turning up. There would be music and tables full of food, we couldn’t believe it. There was everything we needed and we just hung around. ‘At first we automatically assumed the children lived there, but we soon realised they didn’t. They would be brought there, sometimes by Uncle Jimmy, and would stay for six or seven hours until 3 or 4am. They were just little kids, boys and girls. ‘Two or three would go off and come back later. The really strange thing was that they didn’t come out the bedrooms kicking and screaming. None of them seemed to be in any distress, but there is no doubt at all in my mind what they were being used for. Relation: Guy says that his family will agree that his uncle's body should be removed and cremated . ‘They used to say they were “playing.” You heard sounds and moans and groans coming from the bedroom and knew what was going on.’ Guy said he believed he and his friends were there to ‘keep the kids happy’. He said: ‘I didn’t think anything about it at the time, maybe because there was no such thing as paedophiles back then. I never saw Jimmy Savile sexually abuse any of the children, but as far as I am concerned he was part of a paedophile ring at those parties.’ The excursions ended when the teenager got into trouble with the law and was sent to borstal. In later life, Guy said he put his past behind him and became close to Savile. However, they never spoke about what happened and he was concerned that his mother should never find out. ‘Although I was not sexually abused I do feel like a victim myself. I think I should have reported him years ago but I was too scared to do it. ‘Now I am really pleased everyone knows the truth.’","Guy Marsden, now 59, said he and his teenage friends were taken to act as intermediaries for adults and younger children .

McCain will star and serve as executive producer. New show: Meghan McCain, who is to host her own documentary talk show Raising McCain, told the Television Critics Association on Friday that it lets her 'be crazy' and 'talk about issues' The 28-year-old author and blogger told the Television Critics Association on Friday that the show lets her 'be crazy, be myself and talk about issues.' She added to Vulture that though she has grown up in a political family, it would not steal the focus of the show. 'Politics is obviously in my life naturally in every way,' she said.

It is just as well. The show has seen her play kickball on one show, and hang from a trapeze on another. 'It was awful,' she said of the latter. 'Wait til you see. I can’t wait til that c**p hits the Internet. Never hang from a trapeze. I’m not scared of heights and it was horrible. It’s a lot more complicated than people realize. I hated it.'

"Carl Mills, 28, denies murdering three members of the same family . A man accused of murdering a family of three in an arson attack on their home has repeatedly denied starting the lethal blaze. Carl Mills, 28, is accused of starting a fire which ripped through a property in Cwmbran, South Wales, killing his teenage partner and their baby. Grandmother Kim Buckley, 46, her daughter Kayleigh, 17, and six-month-old granddaughter Kimberley all died in the violent blaze in September last year. Mills, who was living in a tent in the house's front garden at the time, sent a series of threatening text messages before the fire. Among them was a warning: 'I will burn your house down.' Mills, on trial at Newport Crown Court, denies all three murders. He entered the witness box today to give evidence in his own defence. The jury has heard that he met Kayleigh through Facebook in August 2010, when she was 15, and later moved from Manchester to Cwmbran to be with her. The prosecution have accused Mills of grooming an immature schoolgirl, who was 'infatuated with him, for sex. He claims that they were engaged, planned to get married and have a family and were in love. Kayleigh Buckley, 17, died alongside her Kim Buckley (right) after their home in South Wales was set on fire . Callous: His own daughter Kimberley Buckley was only six-months-old when she died after a fire swept through the property . Patrick Harrington QC, defending, asked him about 'nasty texts' that he sent to his teenage partner on the night she died. Mills had said he was 'paranoid' and drunk and believed that she was seeing someone else when he sent them. He said that the tone of the text was . 'nasty' and he made threats about the burning the house down, but . denied actually doing it. Gregory Bull QC, prosecuting, asked Mills about his relationship with Kayleigh. Previously the jury heard that Mills, living on £180 benefits a fortnight, initially travelled by bus and train from Manchester to visit her. Mills, who was living in a tent in the house's front garden at the time, sent a series of threatening text messages before the fire . She would later skip school to be with . him and eventually moved into a tent with him when he was living in the . front garden of her home. He told the court he knew she was still a schoolgirl. Mills went on to agree, under questioning, that he kept the relationship from Kayleigh's mother for seven months. Mills said that when was living rough on the streets of Cwmbran, he did not turn Kayleigh away, and she 'kept following him'. He also denied being only interested in havign sex with the teenager. Mills claimed that he was unaware that he was Kayleigh's first boyfriend. The trial continues.

"Bob Baker, the founder of one of America's oldest puppet theaters, died Friday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 90. The cause of death was kidney failure, his biographer, Gregory Williams, said. The Bob Baker Marionette Theater captivated children and adults with its ornate wooden puppets and props. Bob Baker, the founder of one of America's oldest puppet theaters, died Friday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 90. The theater was a vestige of the days when marionettes were widely used on stage and television and playhouses dotted the streets of downtown Los Angeles. 'He really contributed to the continuation of puppetry as an art,' Williams told The Associated Press on Friday. 'With the digital age, it's going in a different direction. But people still come to it because it's an introduction to theater for young people. It's real-life 3D.' Baker discovered puppetry as a child and described being immediately transformed. 'He couldn't talk about anything else when he came home to his mother and he knew what he wanted to do,' Williams said. Baker discovered puppetry as a child and described being immediately transformed . At an early age, he began constructing his own puppets and performed.

Capt Dave managed to capture the footage, which can be seen at Captain Dave's Dolphin and Whale Safari's website, after launching and catching the drone by hand while in a small inflatable boat. He said: 'This is the most beautiful and compelling five minute video I have ever put together. 'I learned so much about these whales and dolphins from this drone footage that it feels like I have entered a new dimension. 'I have not been this excited about a new technology since we built our underwater viewing pods on our whale watching boat.' The footage also features a close-up of a newborn Humpback whale calf with its mother, in Maui. Capt Dave said: 'This is the most beautiful and compelling five minute video I have ever put together' Capt Dave managed to capture the footage by launching and catching the drone by hand while in a small inflatable boat . In January, MailOnline reported how a so-called 'superpod' of dolphins was spotted swimming together off the coast of Costa Rica. The group was thought to include anywhere between 3,000 and 5,000 of the creatures. In the footage, the animals can be seen propelling themselves out of the water before joining scores of others swimming deep under the water's surface. Some of the footage was taken by cameramen both in and above the water, using long-lens and slow motion techniques. But the most amazing, detailed scenes came from cameras installed in 'spy creatures' - fake animals with cameras built into their mouths and eyes.","Captain Dave Anderson used a quadcopter drone to capture footage .

"The tens of thousands of homes left without power over Christmas have all finally been reconnected five days after their electricity was cut off by violent storms. Network bosses have admitted they failed to ensure enough engineers were working over the festive period to repair the damage and were today urged to cancel New Year holidays as more storms approach. Households across the south east of England, north Wales and Cumbria have been without electricity over the last week because of damage caused by the storms. At last: Engineers have restored power to the last of the tens of thousands of homes without electricity following the Christmas storms . It came as another storm of heavy rain and strong winds arrives in the UK, bringing with it a risk of flooding and disruption. The executive of one of the UK's . biggest power distributors has admitted its efforts to restore power to . thousands of people should have been better. Basil . Scarsella, chief executive of the UK Power Networks, has admitted it . was not prepared for the storm and too many staff were on holiday. The . company, which owns electricity lines and cables in London, the south . east and east of England, said it will increase payments for 48 to . 60-hour outages from £27 to £75 for those affected on Christmas Day as . 'a gesture of goodwill'. Admission: Basil Scarsella, chief executive of the UK Power Networks, has said it was not prepared for the storm and too many staff were on holiday . Additional . payments will be made to customers who have been without electricity . for longer than that time - up to a maximum of £432. Mr Scarsella said: 'We could not have avoided the damage caused by the storm but we could have responded to it better. 'A . lot of our employees had gone away for holidays so it meant we had a . level of depletion in our resources - and that caused problems with . getting people's power restored. 'It's . difficult to justify saying the company has performed well when . customers have been without power for five days, but once we had an idea . of how bad it was we were able to mobilise as many engineers and office . staff as possible.' Forecasters have said the latest storm pushing in from the Atlantic will cross the UK from west to east today. The Met Office has issued a severe weather warning over fears of strong gales of up to 80mph affecting Wales, southern, western and northern England and Scotland. It has also warned of the danger of ice patches in the south west tonight as temperatures drop to below freezing. George Goodfellow, a forecaster for MeteoGroup, said: 'Normally, we would say this is a typical winter storm but because we're still recovering from a string of other storms it is likely to cause more disruption and flooding.' He said the south west will continue to bear the brunt of the storm. More bad news: The Met Office has issued a severe weather warning over fears of strong gales of up to 80mph affecting Wales, southern, western and northern England and Scotland today with more storms through the week . The Environment Agency (EA) have around 100 flood alerts in place in southern, western and northern England. Britain is braced for an entire month of bad weather that could see the number of homes flooded more than double. As the big clean-up gets under way in the aftermath of the Christmas storms, persistent rain will sweep across the country today and return to drench New Year’s Eve revellers. Then from New Year’s Day, storms and rain can be expected for the foreseeable future, forecasters warn. ‘There is no end in sight,’ said a Met Office spokesman. The fresh wave of bad weather could see the figure for flooded homes double to more than 2,000 in the worst hit areas of Kent, Surrey and Sussex. The agency said persistent rainfall means there is a ‘continued  heightened flood risk’ across southern England, particularly South-West England. Some 70 flood alerts and five more serious flood warnings remain in place across the country. One warning is in place for Tewkesbury where the ground is still saturated after the Christmas rain. Much of the Gloucestershire town was submerged after the Avon and Severn rivers burst their banks last week. A spokesman for the Met Office said: ‘For as far as we can see, the wet and windy weather is here to stay. There is no end in sight. 'We are in the middle of winter, so this weather is not unusual, but there is no sign of it settling down as we go into January.’ Six people have died during the bad weather, while the bill for insurance companies is likely to top £100million. And the unsettled weather looks set to continue into the new year after the Met Office issued a severe weather warning for rain on New Year's Day, affecting southern England and western Scotland. Some 1,300 properties have been flooded during the recent storms in England, the EA said. Meanwhile energy companies have been criticised for their slow reaction to storm damage. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said he has pressed energy companies to stop staff taking new year holidays as a second week of storms looks set to derail the festive period. Speaking on ITV's Daybreak programme, he said: 'I think some of them (energy companies) definitely let their customers down, and I'm pleased to hear they are going to pay some compensation to those who are out of power. 'We were told yesterday that the final 130 houses (without power) would all be back on by last night and I'll have my daily meeting at nine when I hope to hear that has been achieved. 'Some of the companies have performed, some have not, and I think they have been penalised by the reaction of their customers. It's up to them to compensate their customers. 'We've had two Cobra (the Government's emergency committee) meetings over the last couple of days and we've made it very clear that we expect them to take proper measures - not to let staff go away on holiday over the new year period and to be properly prepared for this week.' Mr Paterson added that emergency financial assistance - known as the Bellwin fund - could be made available to local authorities to ensure flood defences and power supplies remain intact. 'It's dreadful for all those involved but we do give credit to those in the Environment Agency who worked throughout that period and who are working as we speak now,' he said. 'We've had Cobra meetings co-ordinating the other Government departments, and local government has been told at every level that they must make sure they have adequate staff on over the new year period. 'We've also said the 'Bellwin' can be triggered, which is an emergency fund where central government can come in and help.'","Tens of thousands of homes left without .

"Jeremy Paxman is reportedly set to earn almost £1 million from a publishing deal that will include a memoir of his time at the BBC. The veteran broadcaster, 64, famous for discomfiting politicians with his bruising interview style, is said to have signed a three-book contract with the publisher William Collins. While the first volume will chart the changing face of Britain, another will reveal the inside story of his 42-year career with the Corporation. Scroll down for video . Jeremy Paxman (pictured) is said to have signed a three-book contract to reveal the inside story of his career at the BBC . In a withering assessment of BBC2’s Newsnight programme, which he left in June, Mr Paxman, left, said it was now ‘run by 13-year-olds, for whom, at that age, it is perfectly normal to want to change the world’. Meanwhile, Paxman has admitted he was approached about standing as Tory candidate for the mayor of London but said he would not do the job for 'all the eclairs in Paris'. Paxman, who has described himself as 'a one-nation Tory', was reportedly asked to enter the field to replace Boris Johnson, who is standing down in 2016. Mr Johnson hopes to return to Parliament next year after being adopted as the Tory candidate for Uxbridge and South Ruislip and the party is yet to find a potential successor. Paxman said the story 'began life as a Boris Johnson joke', adding: 'I was indeed approached about the gig and invited to see David Cameron to discuss the idea. I decided a week ago that I wouldn't take it on for all the eclairs in Paris.'","Former presenter said to have signed three-book deal worth £1million .

"A mother has been left infuriated after her perfect healthy four-year-old son was labelled as 'clinically obese' by medics based on his BMI score. Mari Moore, 41, was sent the note by health bosses after her son Oshea-Mkai Moore Woodbine, known as Teyo, had his height and weight recorded as part of a school health check. She was astonished to read Teyo had been placed in the 'very overweight' category based on his Body Mass Index (BMI), despite him being perfectly fit and healthy. Angered: Mari Moore was furious after receiving a letter from the Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust telling her that Teyo, 4, was 'clinically obese' Based on Teyo being 114cm tall and weighing 25kg, he has been classed as 'clinically obese'. Single mother Mari, from Leeds, West Yorkshire, said: 'There's absolutely nothing wrong with him. You can see for yourself that he doesn't have a weight problem. 'I think it's despicable they're branding a four-year-old as having a weight problem. No wonder children develop eating disorders when they're told they're fat, even though they're not. 'This will go on his record and that's what makes me most angry. They're giving out the totally wrong impression.' Perfectly healthy: Teyo, of Leeds, West Yorkshire, had his BMI measured as art of a school health check . Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. If you have a BMI above the healthy range you are at raised risk of the serious health problems linked to being overweight, such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease and certain cancers. BMI results are interpreted differently for children and consider weight in relation to height, age and sex. The result is called the child’s BMI centile. Once your child’s BMI centile has been calculated, they will be in one of four categories: . Underweight: Below 2nd BMI centile . Healthy weight: Between the 2nd and 90th BMI centile . Overweight: Between 91st and to 97th BMI centile . Obese: At or above 98th BMI centile. This BMI centile category is called 'very overweight' in letters that are sent by the National Child Measurement Programme. Sources: NHS Choices and NIH . Mari, also mother to Chante Henry, 21, and seven-month-old Stevie Cree, said she prides herself on ensuring all her children are fit and healthy. She added: 'I walk them to school every morning, and I make sure they eat healthily. 'My son is very active and has a good diet. I cook everything from fresh. My idea of a ready meal is left-over Spaghetti Bolognase. I cook in batches and freeze it, and then if my daughter is having a grizzly day, I can get something out of the freezer for us and I know everything that's gone in it.' Teyo started Holy Rosary and St Anne's Roman Catholic Primary School in Leeds, West Yorkshire, in September and soon afterwards was weighed as part of the National Child Measurement Programme. But Mari, a insurance claims advisor, has slammed the Government scheme, and believes other checks need to be done before children are labelled in such a way. She said: 'You have to use some decorum of common sense. They work out these measurements but no-one is using their eyesight to make a realistic view. 'If they're sending letters out like this they're going to make people think they're overweight even if they're not, and instigate a whole load of problems.' Warning: The letter sent to Ms Moore put her son in the 'very overweight' category despite the fact that he is perfectly healthy . The letter also explained each category with 'very overweight' meaning the person is 'clinically obese' and is 'more likely to develop diabetes and high blood pressure' A spokesman for Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust, said: 'Our School Nursing team takes care to ensure the process of the National Child Measurement Programme is explained to the child and families who take part in the programme, from before they are measured to after they receive their outcome letter from Public Health England. 'Defining children as overweight or obese is a complex process. The School Nursing team follows the guidelines set by the Department of Health, which uses BMI. 'If a child has a BMI over 98th percentile, the team will offer a referral to Watch It, the trust's community-based weight management programme.'","Mari Moore, of Leeds, received warning letter from NHS about her son Teyo .

"Scroll down for new video of the crash scene . A truck driver who allegedly fell asleep at the wheel has been charged in the horrific crash which left comedian Tracy Morgan in a critical condition and his closest confidante James McNair dead. 30 Rock star Morgan and his entourage were being chauffeured from a show in Delaware back to New York City about 1am Saturday, when the truck driver rear-ended their . limousine bus and caused a fatal six-car pile up on the New Jersey . Turnpike. Morgan's 'traumatized' ex-wife has revealed 'he's not in good shape' after being pulled from the wreckage with a broken leg among other injuries. He is reportedly in a critical but stable condition. Morgan's assistant Jeffrey Millea, 36, and comedian Ardie Fuqua are also in a critical condition, while 62-year-old McNair, who performed as . Jimmy Mack and was one of Morgan's closest friends, died at the scene. Comic Harris Stanton was treated and released from hospital. Two others in the limo were unhurt, including the driver.

Gregory Williams said Roper, from Jonesboro in Georgia, apparently failed to notice . slow traffic ahead of his 18-wheeler and swerved at the last minute to . avoid a crash near Cranbury Township. But the vehicle plowed into the back of the limo, a 2012 Mercedes Benz Sprinter, prompting a chain-reaction crash with a second tractor-trailer, an SUV and two cars. The limo rotated clockwise and flipped over. 'Driver failed to observe slow-moving traffic ahead,' Sgt Williams said according to ABC News. 'He observed at the last minute - just prior to impact - the limo bus carrying Morgan and his party.' He said alcohol was not believed to be a factor in the crash. ABC News reported the driver was 'dozing', but police would not confirm the report. The National Transportation Safety Board said it was working with state police to look at any issues in the crash related to commercial trucking and limousine safety.

It’s like I’m in a nightmare,' the mother of three of Morgan's children . said. 'We’re just still vigilant with prayer...They’re (our children) not holding up well at all.' She said Morgan, 45, had . a broken leg and was lying unconscious in hospital, but doctors anticipated he would . recover. Sabina Morgan said her old high school sweetheart, who she divorced in 2009, would be heartbroken to know one of his closest friends, McNair, had died. 'He was one of the first comedians that took Tracy under his wing,' she said of McNair. 'They were very close.' McNair’s sister, Valerie Daniel, told CNN that her brother 'spoke very highly of Tracy. They go way back.' Morgan's publicist, Lewis Kay, said in a statement: 'His family is now with him (in hospital) and he is receiving excellent care. We don’t anticipate much of a change in his condition today.' Passengers: Harris Stanton (left) is safe and has already been treated and released from the hospital but the condition of Ardie Faqua (right) remains unknown .

'I was devastated,' Christine Wollover told New York Daily News. 'I couldn’t believe it. I was just hoping and praying that my daughter and the baby weren’t in the car.' Wollover . said her 27-year-old daughter and the couple’s 11-month-old . baby usually travel with the comedian on tours. 'I’m relieved for her and my granddaughter,' she said. 'But (Morgan) is the foundation. I love him dearly, and I just . hope he gets through this.' The New Jersey Turnpike was closed for more than five hours after the crash. Damage: The wreckage of the luxury Mercedes-Benz Sprinter Morgan and his friends had been in is removed from the crash site .

'This is . what it looks like from the stage to see a standing ovation from 1500 . people. Then we traveled back to NYC in style in a luxury Mercedes . Sprinter. Road life is a good life! #tracymorgan,' Fuqua wrote in the . post's caption. Morgan had been due to perform the same show in North Carolina tonight, but that leg of the tour has been canceled. Fatal: One person, believed to have been a passenger on Morgan's bus, was killed in the accident . Pile up: Police are still investigating the crash but believe a tractor-trailer may have rear-ended the bus . Mangled: Six vehicles were involved in the collision, which happened in the early hours of Saturday .

'We are grateful that our drivers did not sustain life-threatening injuries.' Injured: 30 Rock star Morgan, pictured with Megan Wollover last year, was returning from performing a show at a Delaware casino . Star: Morgan made his name on Saturday Night Live! before joining the cast of hit show 30 Rock . Morgan, a New York City native, joined Saturday Night Live in 1996 and was on the sketch-comedy program for seven years before leaving to star in The Tracy Morgan Show in 2003. That show lasted just one season. In 2006, Morgan found a long-running role on NBC's hit show 30 Rock, which was created by SNL co-star Tina Fey. He received an Emmy nomination for best supporting actor for 30 Rock in 2009. Morgan grew up fatherless, one of five siblings, in a blighted section of Brooklyn, where he helped raise and support the family. He once called his gift for being funny 'a defense mechanism' for his miserable circumstances. As a teen, he started doing comedy on the streets to supplement the family's welfare income. His tough upbringing informed his humor. In recent years, he has struggled with alcoholism and drunken driving arrests. He had a successful kidney transplant in late 2010.

"Eight NHS workers are attacked every hour while doing their job, according to new figures which show a nine per cent increase in the number of assaults on employees. The number of reported assaults on NHS staff in England rose from 63,199 in 2012/13 to 68,683 last year. It means almost 200 workers are attacked every day, with the most violent or aggressive incidents taking place in A&E and mental health units, according to experts. The number of reported assaults on NHS staff in England went up from 63,199 in 2012/13 to 68,683 last year . Last year, just 1,649 cases led to criminal sanctions – an increase of just 191 on the previous year. Most of the attacks, which included punching, biting, kicking and even stabbings, occurred when staff were trying to treat or support patients. Experts said the rising figures were 'absolutely shocking' and blamed increased waiting times and NHS cuts on the growing trend. Richard Hampton, of NHS Protect which compiled the figures, said: 'No NHS staff should be physically assaulted and we encourage staff who are victims of violence to press charges against assailants. 'Those who work in the NHS have the right to provide care in a safe environment. Employers must do all they can to support staff in preventing incidents and pursuing offenders.' Janet Davies, of the Royal College of Nursing, added: '68,000 is a huge number of physical assaults against NHS staff, even before you consider the rise of 5,000 in the past year. 'What's even more distressing is that this rise comes at a time when violent crime in the UK is on the decline. 'Sadly, our experience suggests that the assaults that have been reported may be the tip of an even larger iceberg. 'Apart from the pain and suffering, assaults against staff cost the NHS around £60million which could be better spent on improving patient care and providing faster treatment.' Most of the attacks, which included punching, biting, kicking and even stabbings, occurred when NHS workers were trying to treat or support patients, the latest research by NHS Protect found (file picture) Christina McAnea, head of health for UNISON which represents many NHS workers, said no one should feel unsafe at work. She said: 'It is absolutely shocking that every day more than 188 NHS workers are physically attacked. The fact this figure is rising year-on-year should ring alarm bells. 'The cuts and pressure on the service have caused growing patient frustration but no staff should be assaulted or feel unsafe at work. 'There can be no excuse for abusing or assaulting staff and all incidents should be taken very seriously. 'Sadly, violence on NHS premises often go unreported and many workers are left to suffer in silence. 'The NHS must do its best to provide a safe working environment. Both employers and the police need to take these incidents seriously.' The figures come as paramedic Richard Bentley spoke out about the violence he has experienced during his ten-year career on the frontline in the north of England. The 31-year-old said over the last 12 months he has been threatened with a knife, as well as kicked and bitten by a patient while trying to give first aid. He told The Mirror: 'You still don't expect the level of violence that we have to face. 'We have had stabbing cases where we've been told the perpetrator has gone. Then out of nowhere they're back and doing everything they can to stop us treating the patient. 'The job can get seriously dangerous'. He said Saturday nights were often the worse for attacks on workers, describing them as 'particularly volatile' with alcohol being a 'huge contributing factor'. The NHS Protect figures revealed that the the highest number of attacks on ambulance services in England last year occurred in London. Assaults on workers in the capital totalled 414, while attacks on paramedics working for the North West Ambulance Service NHS Trust stood at 377. The fewest number of assaults on an ambulance service alone was in the North East, where there were 73 reported attacks last year.","Number of assaults on NHS workers rose from 63,199 to 68,683 last year .

"Former newspaper tycoon Eddy Shah (pictured with his wife Jennifer outside court yesterday) has been cleared at the Old Bailey of raping a schoolgirl during the early 1990s . Eddy Shah was cleared yesterday of six rapes against an underage girl at top London hotels. The former newspaper tycoon appeared close to tears and thanked the jury as the verdict was read at the Old Bailey. His wife Jennifer was also in tears as he was found not guilty of six counts of raping the girl during the early 1990s when she was aged between 12 and 15. After 17 hours and 46 minutes of deliberations, a jury at the Old Bailey cleared him of six counts of raping a girl under 16. After the hearing he called for a review of how rape cases are dealt with by police as he said: 'Anybody walking down the street can point at a celebrity and say, ""he raped me"".' Former escort Susan Davies, 53, of Swanley, Kent, was cleared of forcing the complainant, now in her early 30s, to have threesomes with her and Shah. Mr Shah maintained that he met the girl twice in hotels while she was accompanied by Davies but never had sex with her. Davies was found not guilty of aiding and abetting rape, indecent assault and cruelty to a person under 16. A . third defendant, businessman Anthony Pallant, 53, of West Malling, . Kent, was also cleared of raping the girl during the same period with . the assistance of Davies. He was found not guilty of rape and indecent . assault. During the trial, Ms Davies described . how she had a relationship with Mr Shah for several years, but claimed . that it never felt like she was working as a prostitute. The court heard that Mr Shah would pay her around £100 to £200 for sex and brought her gifts such as a Pierre Cardin watch. Susan Davies (left) was cleared of forcing the complainant to have threesomes with her and Shah. Anthony Pallant (right) was also cleared of raping the girl during the same period with the assistance of Davies . Ms Davies referred to him as a 'gentleman' and said that she had taken the girl twice to meet him because she thought he could have a positive influence on her life by talking to her. ' With hindsight it was a stupid decision,' she told the court. Ms Davies also had a relationship with Mr Pallant, a three-times married medical equipment entrepreneur with whom she had a son. Mr Shah, whose birth name is Selim Shah, founded the now-defunct Today newspaper in 1986. After . clashes with unions he was the first person to invoke Margaret . Thatcher's anti-union laws. He went on to write several novels. After the hearing Mr Shah called for a review of how rape cases are dealt with by police . Speaking outside court Mr Shah said the case had been brought because of 'cheap policing and cheap prosecution'. He . said: 'I was brought to trial with no real evidence at all - all they . had was the word of a girl and nothing was actually backed up. 'Having been through what I have just been through, I think they should look at what happens. 'They . look at it subjectively, not objectively - they just take it to trial . and I think that is very wrong, there should be some evidence.'

"Poland wants to lure 2,300 of its doctors to leave the NHS and return home. Witold Sobków, the Polish ambassador to the UK, revealed plans were being drawn up to persuade hundreds of health staff trained in Poland to return, declaring: ‘We want them back.’ He also cast doubt on proposals by Britain to limit access to benefits for EU migrants, insisting it will make little difference to the numbers of people who move to the UK in search of work and a better life. Witold Sobków, the Polish ambassador to the UK, said his country wants to attract more Polish doctors back home and dismissed the idea that benefit curbs would reduce the number of EU migrants to Britain . Around a third of the 133,000 doctors in the NHS in England Wales were trained outside the UK. Mr Sobków suggested hundreds were from Poland, and he wanted them to leave the UK and return home. ‘Of course we want them back, of course,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. ‘We have lost - from what I know - 2,300 doctors in Britain. Of course they were educated in Poland for free so we want them, it is obvious. ‘We are doing our best to create conditions so that they could come back and work in Poland.’ Many in the health service argue it could not cope without the influx of qualified professionals from overseas. Almost a third of doctors working in the NHS were trained outside the UK, according to latest figures . Last month Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced dozens of extra foreign doctors had been drafted to bolster hospitals facing a winter crisis. However, Tory MP Bernard Jenkin suggested Britain did not need as many foreign workers and curbs should be introduced. ‘Germany has a very low birth rate, they need foreign workers. We don’t. ‘It has been causing real problems in hospitals, schools, has contributed to shortage of housing, we need to be able to address this in our national interest – we respect theirs, they should respect ours.’ Labour last week announced it would ban migrants from claiming out of work benefits for two years and look to curb access to in-work benefits, like tax credits. David Cameron is expected to make a speech on immigration within days in which he will also pledge to impose limits on migrants’ access to the welfare state. David Cameron is expected to announce a major crackdown on benefits for migrants within days, after Labour's Rachel Reeves announced plans to ban claims for jobseekers allowance for two years and curb access to tax credits for those in work . Latest figures show that almost 65,000 people from the EU were claiming jobseekers allowance in February this year . Latest figures show there are 64,830 EU migrants claiming jobseekers allowance in the UK, while are 252,000 working households from the EU receive tax credits. Mr Sobków insisted that attempts to limit access to these benefits would not stop Poles moving to Britain. ‘I wouldn’t say it would have an enormous effect… benefit tourism is only a small fraction of abuse of the system. ‘People don’t come here for benefits they come here for work.’ He said that there are a lot of ‘wrong assumptions’ about the motivations people have for moving to the UK . ‘One is people sit at home in Poland and start calculating how much they can lose and gain.’ ‘We have several important reasons if we decide to emigrate to other countries to work. ‘I know very wealthy people who moved to Sweden and other countries for better research laboratories. ‘The wrong assumption is the same as it was 20 years ago that we have low skilled labour, a lot of them are low skilled but a lot of them are not. ‘They are attracted because the wages are higher, not the benefits.’","Ambassador Witold Sobków says 2,300 Polish doctors are in the UK .

"A migrant from Algeria who threatened to torch his two daughters and ex-girlfriend cannot be thrown out of Britain - because of his 'right to a family life'. The Algerian national, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was ruled a danger to his daughters, now five and seven, by social workers. A Child Protection Plan even forbids him from living with them in the West Midlands. The 42-year-old was imprisoned for 15 months in 2012 after Wolverhampton Crown Court heard he vowed to burn down his house with his children and their Angolan mother inside. A case at the immigration and asylum Upper Tribunal chamber (pictured) heard that the Algerian migrant should be allowed to remain in the UK - despite threatening to kill his former girlfriend and children . But despite that, the migrant has won the right to remain in the UK. Tory MP Philip Hollobone said he was disgusted by the decision. He told the Sun on Sunday: 'This is exactly why the Human Rights Act should be scrapped. 'Any foreign national convicted of a crime should be deported and banned from ever returning. Conservative MP for Kettering Philip Hollobone said it was farcical to let the Algerian, 42, remain in the UK . The immigrant arrived in the UK in December 2003 when he paid smugglers to get him in. He claimed asylum the next day giving a false name and date of birth. His claim was refused in February 2004, but his two separate appeals were both dismissed. He remained in the UK, however, and six years later he was convicted at Brent Magistrates' Court of drink driving. Then two years later, he was jailed for 15 months and Home Secretary Theresa May signed a deportation order to send him back to his native country when he was freed. An immigration tribunal was even told deporting him would not have a detrimental effect on his children. The father-of-two was given a deportation order after he was jailed for 15 months in 2012 at Wolverhampton Crown Court (pictured) - but he has now been granted the right to remain in the UK . However, Judge Conway allowed him to remain in the country. He said: 'You have been punished enough and I do not think further supervision is going to help you. 'What will help you is trying to get on the rails with your family and your children and I know that you are determined to do that. You made a very serious mistake but you are not a danger to the public and you are not a fire raiser.' A spokesman for the Home Office told MailOnline: 'Foreign criminals have abused human rights for far too long and claimed that their right to a family life in Britain outweighs the impact of their crimes on their victims. 'The new Immigration Act will make it even harder for foreign criminals to launch spurious appeals to stay in country by cutting the number of appeal rights from 17 to four. 'It will also allow a deport first, appeal later approach for some foreign criminals making Article 8 claims. 'Foreign nationals who break the law should be deported. And that is what the Act will help us deliver.'","42-year-old Algerian migrant was imprisoned for 15 months in 2012 .

"David Mellor apologised for his rant at a taxi driver - and promised to stick to water at lunch from now on . David Mellor apologised yesterday for his rant at a taxi driver – and promised to stick to water at lunch from now on. The former Cabinet Minister, making his first public comments since a recording emerged of him calling the driver a 'sweaty, stupid little s***', said he was 'really, really sorry' for his tirade. Mr Mellor told listeners of his LBC radio show that he had endured a 'torrid' week, 'but probably no worse than I deserved'. He said: 'I can't think what possessed me to lose it with that cabbie the way I did. 'I had a case but I threw it away by the way I spoke and I'm really, really sorry about that, and I especially want to apologise to you, our listeners, for trying your patience and risking my own credibility with you by speaking the way I did.' Mr Mellor, who pledged to make a 'substantial' donation to the cab drivers' Christmas children's appeal, added: 'Anyway, it's water for me at the next celebratory lunch, I've definitely made that decision.' During the cab ride, which he made earlier this month following a visit to Buckingham Palace with his partner Lady Cobham, Mr Mellor disagreed with the driver over the best route back to his £8 million riverside home. The former Culture Secretary listed his life's achievements and demanded: 'Who are you to question me? I've been in the Cabinet, I'm an award-winning broadcaster, I'm a Queen's Counsel.' He added: 'I don't want to hear from you. Get a better education. Shut the f*** up. Smart-arsed little b******.' Earlier in the day, Mr Mellor and Lady Cobham, who is the chairman of VisitEngland, had attended an investiture at Buckingham Palace, where she was presented with a CBE by Prince Charles for her services to tourism. Fall out: Mr Mellor lost his temper because he believed the taxi driver was taking the wrong route home to St Katharine Docks near Tower Bridge from Buckingham Palace. The incident occurred at rush-hour on Friday . Partners: David Mellor and Lady Cobham were being taken by the driver back to his £8million riverside home . The ceremony was followed by a celebratory lunch at an upmarket London restaurant, which ran until nearly 6pm. The now-infamous journey began after the couple were picked up outside the restaurant in Marylebone by the unidentified taxi driver. Mr Mellor's verbal volley, which led to the threat of a mass boycott by black cab drivers, came in the wake of the row over Labour frontbencher Emily Thornberry 'snobbishly' tweeting a picture of a home in Rochester, and just days before a High Court judge ruled against former Tory Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell in the 'Plebgate' affair. The cab driver, a 38-year-old from South-East London who said he earns £28,000 a year, said: 'Mr Mellor made me feel like I am something he'd found on the bottom of his shoe.'","Former Cabinet Minister said he was 'really, really sorry' for his tirade .

"On leave: Steubenville High School Superintenent Michael McVey was placed on leave after new charges in relations to the rape of a girl, 16 . The Ohio grand jury which is investigating whether there was a cover-up in the notorious Steubenville rape case today announced the indictment of four more people - including the school superintendent and an assistant football coach. Steubenville High School superintendent Michael McVey was hit with felony charges for tampering with evidence and obstruction of justice in the case of the sexual assault of a 16-year-old girl by two high school footballers after an alcohol-fueled party in August 2012. In addition to McVey, assistant coach, Matthew Belardine was charged with allowing underage drinking, obstructing official business and making a false statement. Two other school employees, Wrestling coach Seth Fluharty and elementary school principal Lynette Gorman, were charged with failure to report child abuse. 'People made bad choices and the grand jury said there are repercussions,' Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine said in announcing the indictments today at a news conference. The high school’s beloved head Coach Saccoccia , who was accused of telling football players that he would protect the two rapists from any repercussions, is not facing any consequences from the grand jury. Scroll down for video . Charges: Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine announces indictments against four additional people in relation to the 2012 rape of a high school student . The charges have been handed down by the grand jury convened in April to investigate the circumstances surrounding the rape of the 16-year-old girl by Trent Mays, 17 and Ma'Lik Richmond, 16, who were found guilty in March and sentenced to at least a year in juvenile prison. The grand jury panel has met 18 times, heard from 123 witnesses and spent seven months working on the case. The grand jury had investigated whether adults like coaches or school administrators knew of the rape allegation but failed to report it as required by state law. Last month, the grand jury also issued indictments against William Rhinaman, the Steubenville schools' technology director, who is accused of tampering with evidence and obstructing justice, and his daughter, who was indicted for theft unrelated to the rape case. Cover-up: Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine answers questions at a news conference where he announced indictments against four additional people in relation to the 2012 rape of a high school student in Steubenville, Ohio . 'Some may ask why others were not indicted,' DeWine said, as he explained that a grand jury needs probable cause to charge someone. 'It is simply not sufficient that person’s behavior was reprehensible, disgusting, mean-spirited or just plain stupid,' he said. 'Barring any new evidence, I believe that the grand jury’s work is done.' DeWine said that small city of Steubenville had been traumatized by the actions of a few. 'It's time to let Steubenville move on,' he said. Mr DeWine had made clear his intention to root out all guilty parties in the ongoing investigation into the case that shocked America when it came to trial in March. Then promising high school football stars Trent Mays, 17 and Ma'lik Richmond, 16, were found guilty of raping a 16-year-old in a series of back to back house parties. Images of the girl, catastrophically drunk, naked, abused and humiliated were posted online. Friends of the rapist, and their victim, tweeted vile comments and exchanged pictures of the girl, strung up between her attackers by her wrists and ankles. Trial by social media: The messages over . Twitter, Instagram and text that were exchanged on the night of the rape . and the following day were central to the case - and to the outrage it . has caused . nationwide . Mays was sentenced to a minimum of one year in juvenile detention for the two counts on which he was convicted: raped and possession and distribution of pornographic material involving a minor. Richmond was charged only on the count of rape and sentenced to a minimum of one year. Both face a maximum of detention until the age of 21 and have to register as sex offenders thereafter – a punishment against which Richmond has since appealed. The crime continues to divide the blue-collar town on the Virginia River. With the victim too drunk to remember the crime texts and pictures taken on the night saw the attackers convict themselves with their own words. Guilty verdict: Ma'lik Richmond (pictured right) reacts after learning the verdict in his trial at the juvenile court in . Steubenville, Ohio, March 17 . Together: Trent Mays, 17, left, gets a hug from . his father after Trent and co-defendant Ma'lik Richmond, 16, were found . delinquent on rape and other charges in March . The first the victim knew of her fate was when pictures of her lying naked on a basement floor were posted online. The conduct of Head Coach Reno Saccoccia has come under particular scrutiny and led to online petitions demanding the High School official be fired. Saccoccia refused to even bench his stars at first, telling the principal and school superintendent that the players did not think they had done anything wrong and therefore he had no reason to suspend them from the team. Saccoccia has coached two generations of Big Red players and won three state titles and 85 per cent of his games. Cover Up: Angry protesters demonstrate in Steubenville demanding all who played a part in the rape and its aftermath be held accountable . He was made Head Coach in 1984 and in 1991 Big Red became the fastest team to win 100 games in Ohio's history. In 2007 the field at Big Red's Harding Stadium, which feature a huge rearing horse that breaths fire whenever the home team scores or comes on the field and is known locally as Death Valley, was named Reno Field in Saccoccia's honor . MailOnline was the first to report that the 63-year-old coach could face charges and that investigators planned to interview him and all 19 of the High School's coaching staff. However, DeWine announced today that the Grand Jury was finished and therefore Saccoccia will not face charges .","Steubenville High School superintendent Michael McVey charged with tampering with evidence and obstruction of justice .

"The Minnesota Republican Party county official who called Muslims 'parasites' on his personal Facebook account has resigned and lost his job at his local hardware store. Republican Jack Whitley resigned from his position as Big Stone County GOP Chair after coming under fire for calling Muslims terrorists, 'parasites,' and saying they deserve to be killed. Though Whitley had no plans to resign initially, he said he was asked to do so by other board members. Resigned: Republican Jack Whitley resigned from his position as Big Stone County GOP Chair Jack Whitley after coming under fire for calling Muslims terrorists, 'parasites,' and saying they deserved to be killed . In two separate posts last week, Whitley wrote that he does not believe Muslim terrorists should be waterboarded because that would be a 'waste of resources,' but they should be 'fragged' -- killed using a hand grenade -- instead. He said that millions of Muslims -- who he called parasites -- should be fragged on their travel to Mecca. When Whitley came under fire for these comments, he returned to Facebook to voice his opinions. Whitley wrote that he will not apologize or compromise and continued to write that Muslims need to accept Jesus Christ or leave the country. In a statement, the GOP condemned Whitley's remarks and called them 'outrageous,' according to the StarTribune. 'They could not be further from the Republican Party's beliefs, Keith Downey, Minnesota Republican Party Chairman, said, 'nor more contrary to the efforts we have undertaken to include Muslim Americans, and every American, in our Party.' Whitley's resignation was effective Friday, and the Tribune reports that the anti-Muslim comments have cost Whitley is job at a hardware store in Ortonville. 'Everything Jack said was so contrary to the way my husband and I conduct our life and the way we believe and think that we just couldn't tolerate it,' Sue Kulbeik, one owner of 'Hardware Hank,' said. 'We even asked him, 'Is that really how you feel?' And he said, 'Absolutely,'' Kulbeik said. 'We said, 'You're no longer needed at our store.' Whitley declined to tell the Associated Press whether he would continue to stand by his statements.","Minnesota Republican Party official Jack Whitley resigned from his position as Big Stone County GOP Chair  after coming under fire for calling Muslims terrorists, 'parasites,' and saying they deserve to be killed .

"Racism, homophobia and general intolerance are not unique to any particular region of the US - that is the conclusion that California college students have reached after mapping out hate speech based on Twitter posts. Undergraduate students at Humboldt State University analyzed 150,000 geocoded tweets sent out between June 2012 and April 2013 containing 10 pre-selected hate words in three categories: Racism, homophobia and disability. After processing the data aggregated by the DOLLY Project, the team comprised of three students in Dr Monica Stephens’ advance cartography class produced an interactive map as part of The Geography of Hate project. Mapping bigotry: Undergraduate students at Humboldt State University analyzed 150,000 geocoded tweets containing 10 pre-selected hate words in three categories: Racism, homophobia and disability . Disturbing findings: Researchers discovered 41,306 tweets containing the word 'n*****,' which were not concentrated in any single region of the US . The avoid the pitfall of an algorithm automatically classifying a tweet as negative if it contains a 'hate word,' the organizers of the project relied on students to read the entirety of the message for context before deciding if is tweet is in fact hateful. Only words unequivocally deemed as ‘hate speech’ were used in the creation of the map. That way, a phrase like ‘dykes on bikes,’ for example, was left out of the data used in the project because it referenced a gay pride event in San Francisco. To produce the map, all tweets containing each 'hate word' were aggregated to the county level and normalized by the total Twitter traffic in each county. Human touch: Since an algorithm would automatically classify a tweet as negative if it contains a 'hate word,' the organizers of the project had the students to read the entirety of the message before deciding if is hateful . America's true colors: Where there is a larger proportion of negative tweets referencing a particular 'hate word' the region appears red; where the proportion is moderate, the area is shaded a pale blue . Where there is a larger proportion of negative tweets referencing a particular 'hate word' the region appears red on the map; where the proportion is moderate, the word was used less and appears a pale blue on the map. Areas without shading indicate places that have a lower proportion of negative tweets relative to the national average. Researchers discovered 41,306 tweets containing the word ‘n*****’, 95,123 referenced ‘homo’, among other terms. Tweets that included the slur ‘n*****’ used for African-Americans were not concentrated in any single region in the US; instead, there are a number of pockets of concentration, including East Iowa, where 31 users sent out 41 tweets referencing the word, and Fountain, Indiana, where there were 22 tweets containing the slur. Pockets of hatred: Most of the tweets containing the word 'wetback ' - an offensive term of illegal Mexican immigrants - came from several parts of Texas . Perhaps the most interesting concentration comes for references to ‘wetback’ - a derogatory term used for illegal Mexican immigrants. Most tweets containing the offensive term came from several parts of Texas, which surprisingly are not even close to the Mexican-American border. Under the category of racism, besides 'n***** and ‘wetback’ students also looked at the usage of such slurs as 'chink' and 'gook' refering to Chinese and Korenas, respectively, and 'spick,' which is an offensive term for Hispanics. The word 'chink' was concentrated in Central Minnesota, where 19 users referenced the slurs in a total of 23 tweets.","The project Geography of Hate was created by cartography students at Humboldt State University .

"A One Direction fan who sparked outrage around the world over the last few days when she claimed she killed her pet Chihuahua in a fit of rage because the British boy band did not respond to requests to follow her on Twitter - is a hoax as many had suspected. The woman sent a desperate tweet to the five singers from her @illumivato account two weeks ago saying: 'Follow me or I'll break my dog's neck'. The post was accompanied by a picture showing someone pinning a dog to the ground by its throat. Sick: A montage of images from the Twitter account of a One Direction fan claiming to break her dog's neck after the band did not respond to her plea to follow her . Hoax: While the Twitter user claimed that she had killed the dog in August - this image of the same girl was in circulation in June on the internet . Confession: @illumivato admitted that she was a troll and the claims were not true after being besieged by angry users and before her account was suspended by Twitter . But with millions of tweets being sent to their account everyday, the group very likely did not spot the message and it went ignored. Several days later, she wrote directly to band member Liam Payne on the social networking site to say: 'I love you. Follow me. My dog has just died.' She added a picture that she claimed showed her crying as she cradled a dead dog. But that image has been widely used by internet users to create memes on Spanish speaking sites since June - a full month before @illumivato had claimed to have killed the dog. It appears to have been part of a trend in Mexico where Facebook users have been posting bizarre pictures on social media to get comments under the hashtag #palface, short for 'pone al Facebook', or put on Facebook. The image usually has the words 'lol se murio mi perro' written across it, meaning 'lol (laugh out loud) my dog died'. Many internet users were appalled to think that someone could really kill the dog - but many will be as equally outraged to think that anyone would find the hoax remotely funny.

"Evidence of gentle giants that swam in the oceans more than 500 million years ago has been discovered. Fossils found in northern Greenland show that ancient, giant marine creatures used bizarre, whale-like facial appendages to filter food from the ocean. The study described how the strange species, named Tamisiocaris, used huge, specialised facial parts to filter plankton - similar to the way some modern whales feed today. Scroll down for video . Bizarre: Tamisiocaris (illustration, pictured) swam using flaps down either side of the body and had large appendages in front of its mouths to catch prey. These appendages were made up of jointed segments, which could curl like fingers to grasp prey . Tamisiocaris belonged to a group of . animals called anomalocarids. The creatures lived 520 million years ago . during the Early Cambrian - a period known as the Cambrian Explosion - in . which all the major animal groups and complex ecosystems suddenly . appeared. Anomalocarids were a type of early arthropod that included some of the largest animals of the Cambrian period. They were flat animals that had two grasping appendages in front of the mouth, known as the 'great appendages'. These were made up of jointed segments, which could curl like fingers to grasp prey. Each segment also featured a pair of spines used to impale food. The new fossils show that these predators eventually . evolved into suspension feeders when these grasping appendages morphed . into a filtering apparatus. Tamisiocaris is one of many recent . discoveries of diverse anomalocarids found in rocks aged between 520 . to 480 million years old in northern Greenland.

Tamisiocaris belonged to a group of animals called anomalocarids, a type of early arthropod that included the largest and some of the most iconic animals of the Cambrian period. They swam using flaps down either side of the body and had large appendages in front of their mouths that may have used to capture larger prey, such as trilobites. However, the newly discovered fossils show that those predators eventually evolved into suspension feeders when these grasping appendages morphed into a filtering apparatus. This meant the animals could be sweep through water and trapping small crustaceans and other organisms as small as half a millimetre in size like a net. Lead author Dr Jakob Vinther, a lecturer in macro-evolution at the University of Bristol, said: 'These primitive arthropods were, ecologically speaking, the sharks and whales of the Cambrian era. 'In . both sharks and whales, some species evolved into suspension feeders . and became gigantic, slow-moving animals that in turn fed on the . smallest animals in the water.' In . order to fully understand how the Tamisiocaris might have fed, the . researchers created a 3D computer animation of the feeding appendage to . explore the range of movements it could have made. Pictured is one of the feeding appendages of Tamisiocaris borealis. It would have worked similarly to the grill found in modern whales to filter plankton out of sea water . Dr Martin Stein, of the University of Copenhagen who created the computer animation, said: 'Tamisiocaris would have been a sweep net feeder, collecting particles in the fine mesh formed when it curled its appendage up against its mouth. 'This is a rare instance when you can actually say something concrete about the feeding ecology of these types of ancient creatures with some confidence.' The discovery also helps highlight just how productive the Cambrian period was, showing how vastly different species of anomalocaridids evolved at that time, and provides further insight into the ecosystems that existed hundreds of millions of years ago. Tamisiocaris belonged to a group of animals called anomalocarids. They would have used their large appendages to capture larger prey, such as trilobites (fossil, pictured) before they evolved into suspension-feeding mammals . The ancient creature is the ancestors of modern whales, such as the humpback whale, pictured here, which feed by forcing water through its mouth filters and trapping small crustaceans and other organisms like a net . Dr Vinther added: 'The fact that large, free-swimming suspension feeders roamed the oceans tells us a lot about the ecosystem. 'Feeding on the smallest particles by filtering them out of the water while actively swimming around requires a lot of energy - and therefore lots of food.' Co-author Dr Nicholas Longrich, of the University of Bath, added: 'We once thought that anomalocarids were a weird, failed experiment. 'Now we're finding that they pulled off a major evolutionary explosion, doing everything from acting as top predators to feeding on tiny plankton.' The Tamisiocaris fossils were discovered during a series of recent expeditions led by co-author David Harper, a professor at Durham University and the findings are published in the journal Nature.","Fossils found in Greenland reveal marine animals used facial appendages to filter food from the ocean .

"Failing care homes will be taken over by teams of specialist troubleshooters under Government plans to end the scandal of old age abuse. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told MPs that the NHS watchdog, the Care Quality Commission, would be given the power to put care homes in special measures if they were neglecting patients. He said: 'We must never again have a situation where the system knows there is a problem but the public don't.' Mr Hunt added: 'There are still too many where I would personally not want my mother or my father or grandparents to live in.' Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said standards in care homes were not good enough, after revealing plans for Ofsted-style inspections . Care homes will come to be seen as a quirk of the health service at the end of the last century, Simon Stevens argued . Putting hospital trusts in special measures was part of the government's response to the Mid Stafford hospital scandal in which around 1,200 people needlessly died. An inquiry highlighted the 'appalling and unnecessary suffering of hundreds of people' at the trust and investigations revealed that many patients were left lying in their own urine and excrement for days, forced to drink water from vases and given the wrong medication. A year ago, following a review into 14 other hospital trusts with higher than expected death rates, 11 trusts were put into special measures for a catalogue of failings and fundamental breaches of care. This afternoon Mr Hunt said that a similar system would be rolled out into care homes and home care services. From October services across England will face a tough new inspection regime, he said. Care homes and home care services will receive Ofsted-style ratings and those rated inadequate face being put into special measures. If they fail to make improvements they could be shut down, Mr Hunt said. Earlier this week it was also reported that a similar regime would be rolled out for GP services. Mr Hunt said: 'There are many excellent home care providers and many outstanding care homes in this country, but there are still too many where I would personally not want my mother or my father or grandparents to live in. 'The public have been really shocked by stories of abuse and neglect, and we need to give the public confidence that when these things happen they will be spotted quickly and acted on.' Mr Hunt added: 'When I have had relatives go into care homes the experience has been mixed. I have had ones that I have thought were OK and I have had ones that I wasn't so happy with. 'The judgment I made as a member of the public was usually about the feeling of compassionate care that you got from the staff who worked in the institution. 'What you are not able to do as a member of the public is look with expert eyes that Andrea's team are able to do. Where this will really help is that it will give expert backbone to those judgements.' Simon Stevens (right), who took up his role as chief executive of NHS England earlier this year, called for new ways of looking after people at home . Andrea Sutcliffe, the chief inspector of social care at the Care Quality Commission, added: 'Week in and week out people tell me and my team, or inspectors discover, truly awful care which should not be happening. 'Sometimes it's abuse, older people treated roughly or worrying bruises that have no explanation. 'Sometimes it is neglect, people living with dementia not supported to eat and drink so they end up with malnutrition or life-threatening dehydration. 'Sometimes it's a shocking lack of respect for people's dignity, dressed in someone else's clothes that don't fit, men not having a regular shave because staff are too busy, no one taking the time to find out what makes you happy or just to talk to you. 'It can all add up to a thoroughly miserable or frightening experience for people often in the most vulnerable of circumstances. 'It doesn't just affect the individual, it affects the whole family. The worst part of the letters I read sometimes is the distress and guilt that the family feel. It can be truly heartbreaking. 'Those examples of failing care reinforce my determination to make sure that we call time on poor care.' Earlier this month the boss of the National Health Service said he would be ‘disappointed’ if nursing homes still existed in 50 years’ time. Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, said that he believes better community care and advances in dementia research can be used to help people stay in their homes. It follows public concern about the treatment of the elderly in some care homes in recent years. Mr Stevens likened the concept of care homes to TB beds, where patients were consigned on wards to be treated with the deadly disease.","Health Secretary said troubleshooters could be sent into failing care homes .

"Pensioner benefits including free TV licences, bus passes and help with heating bills could be cut under government plans to limit welfare spending. Iain Duncan Smith warned existing protections for a raft of benefits would have to ‘disappear’ once the government sets a limit on the £100billion welfare bill. The state pension will be specifically excluded, but the Work and Pensions Secretary made clear that additional payments made to pensioners would not be exempt from any future squeeze. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said most ringfences protecting benefits would have be removed . There is growing tension in the Cabinet over where up to £12billion in benefit cuts should fall. Chancellor George Osborne has made clear the pain should be felt by working-age claimants. But the Lib Dems and even some senior Tories are dismayed at the reluctance to consider cuts to pensioner perks. David Cameron has vowed to honour his 2010 election pledge not to cut pension benefits including the winter fuel allowance, free TV licences and bus passes. Mr Duncan Smith is understood to be among urging that a commitment to leave universal pensioner benefits untouched until 2015 should be reviewed after the next election. In the Autumn Statement Mr Osborne announced details of a new cap on total welfare spending. At the start of the Parliament the government would have to set a limit on the amount which will be spent on benefits each year, currently around £112billion, and if it is breached ministers would be hauled to explain themselves to the Commons. Pensioner benefits including the free bus pass could be included in the welfare cap . Giving evidence to MPs yesterday, Mr Duncan Smith revealed that pensioner benefits would be included in the welfare cap raising the prospect of them being cut if spending ran out of control. ‘We need maximum flexibility with the cap. Pretty much all existing ringfences will have to disappear,’ he said. The new welfare cap will include most benefits within the control of ministers, but will not include Jobseekers Allowance or the state pension. While the idea of limiting total spending has proved popular with the public, the government has face criticism over what this might mean for individual benefits. In December Mr Cameron admitted that maternity and paternity pay for new parents would be included in a new cap on welfare spending. The cost of the benefits, which are paid to mothers and fathers who take time off work to look after their children, is set to exceed £2.5billion a year within four years as more parents take them up. But within hours of the the Prime Minister confirming that they will be covered by a new, overall cap on most welfare spending the Treasury was forced into a pledge that it would not cut them in the next Parliament. Chris Leslie, Labour’s shadow Treasury minister, said: ‘There are clearly major divisions within the Government over whether to cap pensioner benefits. ‘One minute Downing Street are ruling it out and the next Iain Duncan Smith is ruling it in. It is time for the Government to come clean over what exactly they are going to do with pensioner benefits.’ A government source said: 'We have been very clear that the state pension will not be included in the welfare cap. 'We will announce more details about what will be included in the cap in our manifesto.'","Iain Duncan Smith says almost all ringfences will have to 'disappear'

"Black Friday gave Amazon its busiest day ever, with the online retailer saying it had 'surpassed all expectations'. The website recorded orders for more than 5.5million goods, with around 64 items sold per second. It hopes to repeat its success tomorrow, Cyber Monday, with new offers every ten minutes. Early indications show this weekend, which kicked off with chaotic scenes and flashes of violence in the early hours of Friday, is likely to be the biggest UK shopping weekend of all time. Scroll down for video . Black Friday was Amazon's busiest day ever, taking orders for more than 5.5million items, an average of 64 every second . It was all hands at the pumps at an Amazon warehouse in Peterborough last week as workers prepared for what could be the busiest weekend in UK shopping history . Last year's Black Friday was also a record day for amazon.co.uk, when it sold more than four million items. It was surpassed on Cyber Monday 2013, when more than 4.1million items were ordered at a rate of 47 purchases a second. Xavier Garambois, the vice-president of EU Retail at Amazon, said: 'This year really has surpassed all of our expectations. The public's appetite for Black Friday has been bigger than ever, kicking off the Christmas shopping period in earnest. 'Ever since we introduced Black Friday to the UK in 2010, sales have increased year on year but this year really has surpassed all of our expectations.' Jace TyrrelI, deputy chief executive of the New West End company - which represents hundreds of stores on Oxford, Bond and Regent Streets in central London - said he thought more than three million shoppers would visit shops in the area over the weekend. He said: 'This is the busiest trading weekend of the year so far. Yesterday footfall on Oxford Street was up seven per cent on last year as the majority of promotions were high street brands. Today will be a big day as well because it's a full trading day - shops will be open until 10pm. 'Opening hours are restricted on Sunday, and Monday will be back to work for many. More than three million shoppers are expected to visit shops around Oxford and Regent Streets in central London from Friday to Sunday . 'We're set to make £220million across the West End for Friday, Saturday and Sunday - up between 5-10 per cent on last year.' Online retailers are braced for their busiest day of the year as consumers take part in the annual pre-Christmas shopping spree - Cyber Monday. Recent years have seen online shopping figures consistently peaking on the first Monday in December, thought to be a combination of the last payday before Christmas falling on the previous Friday and a weekend spent browsing the shops before buying online. Mr Tyrrell predicted that while shoppers would be returning to work on Monday, they would continue shopping online. He said: 'John Lewis are having a very strong online trade. Smart retailers are maxing their online transactions.'","Black Friday was Amazon's busiest day ever, 'surpassing all expectations'

"A fearless daredevil has risked his life by climbing an industrial chimney and balancing on a beam above a sheer drop - without safety equipment. Flaviu Cernescu scaled the abandoned structure in Pitesti, Romania, using a disconnected electrical cable to hoist himself for the first 70ft of the climb.

"Sophie Tweed-Simmons - daughter of legendary Kiss bassist Gene Simmons - has launched her first fashion line, and it's all about making young women feel their best whatever their size. Fed up with over-priced, ill-fitting clothes, the curvaceous 22-year-old entrepreneur joined forces with TheStyleClub to create the 18-piece collection; priced between $25 and $115 in sizes small, medium and large, and all named after strong and influential  women. 'The cuts of the pieces are all flattering,' Sophie, based in Los Angeles, tells MailOnline. 'All the waistbands are elastic, which I prefer. Essentially, the collection is based around my butt.' Scroll down for video . Bombshell: Sophie Tweed-Simmons, daughter of Kiss bassist Gene Simmons, has launched her first fashion line, in collaboration with TheStyleClub, which she modeled herself (pictured) Sophie, a passionate advocate for healthy body image having grown up in a Hollywood bubble where appearances mean everything, stands at 5'8"" and is a U.S. size 8-10. 'I have never been a ""skinny"" girl, I've always been athletic and curvy and strong,' she remarks, adding that her weight has fluctuated over the years. 'So yeah, the hot pants trend wasn’t a good look for me. And I struggled trying so hard to fit in growing up. 'I went through a laundry list of things that got me to this point of thinking I'm pretty awesome. No one has to sell me on me, I already like me.' Practical: 'The cuts of the pieces are all flattering,' Sophie tells MailOnline. Pictured, the $64 Folorunso faux-fur pencil skirt (left) and the $68 Arianna sweater (right) Floral delight: The 18-piece collection is priced between $25 and $115, and available in sizes small, medium and large.

Pictured, the $65 Jane cardigan and the $60 Malala skirt . While Sophie, whose mother Shannon Tweed was a famous Playboy Bunny, concedes there is no 'normal' body type, she made sure her collection was cut around 'proven classics.' 'The skirts are pencil and the sweaters are adorably oversized and look amazing tucked or untucked,' she says, adding that she wears a size medium in the shorts and a size large in the skirts. 'But we also wanted some risk in there so we have the Peron shorts, which are high-waisted and cut more like a basketball short. The tomboy in me loves them.' Because it is the first collection, Sophie went with the standard small, medium and large sizing options. 'If we get demand for other sizes we will make them. 'And that's how it should be. We don't want to limit who buys the collection based on sizing; the cuts will look good on everyone. 'We want our shoppers to be part of the process with us. So give us feedback and tell us what's working on your body. Just because it works on my butt doesn't mean it works for everyone.'

Beauty: While Sophie, whose mother Shannon Tweed was a famous Playboy Bunny, concedes there is no 'normal' body type, she made sure her collection was cut around 'proven classics' As far as her personal favorites, Sophie is particularly proud of the glittering double-slip Sappho skirt. 'It is stretchy, so I don't worry about ripping my seam in a delicate sequined skirt at a party,' she says. 'And it has built in shorts underneath, so you don't have to worry about any flashing mishaps.' She adds: 'The Monroe faux fur because it's just badass, and the Arianna sweater. I love a soft white sweater, it never goes out of style.' Sophie also made a point of keeping the line animal cruelty-free, so none of the pieces are real leather or fur. 'I do not condone fur. There is no use for it,' she reveals. 'We aren't shivering in caves anymore. We are modern women who have the consciousness to make the choice not to skin an animal. 'I understood when it was for survival but now it's a little ridiculous.' Friend to all beasts: Sophie almost made a point of keeping the line animal cruelty-free, so none of the pieces are real leather or fur . Self-approval: 'I went through a laundry list of things that got me to this point of thinking I'm pretty awesome. No one has to sell me on me, I already like me,' she says . Sophie, who recently signed with Kitten Model Group’s Bombshell division - a unique agency which celebrates real body image and real sized women - was also careful to keep the prices reasonable. 'I was trying on clothes in a store - which I won't name - and everything was ill-fitting and incredibly overpriced, and I just had it,' she explains of her inspiration behind the line. 'I would rather have a few cute pieces I can wear over and over again which aren't as expensive as a couture coat that is only applicable at the Met Ball.' Sophie named each item after strong, influential women whom she admires. 'We wanted girls to not only feel confident when wearing fun, fearless clothing but to think about the women that came before them blazing the trail for all of us,' she explains. All that glitters: The $67 Sappho skirt (left) and the $64 Folorunso skirt (right) Cropped: The $47 Boudicca blouse (left) and the $50 Folorunso shorts (right) Basics: The $48 Sheryl blouse (left) and the $65 Jane cardigan (right) There's the aforementioned faux-fur jacket, named after Marilyn Monroe, a sweater named after Gwen Stefani and another named after Oprah. There's a crop top named after poet Emily Dickinson, a cardigan named after writer Jane Austin, a miniskirt named after recent Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai, a turtleneck named after Hillary Clinton and a faux-leather skirt named after Michelle Obama. And she may be a budding fashion designer, with a diamond jewelry line in the pipeline next, but that's not all the vivacious character has up her sleeve. As well as being a model and an actress, she's penning a book aimed at young girls, and gearing up to release her first EP; having written all her own songs. She is also the founder of Sophie’s Place in Vancouver, Canada; a shelter which provides a place of sanctuary and support for vulnerable young people.

'I can be as many slashes as I want! I'm all for women doing it all and doing it well.' Asked what three pieces of advice she'd give herself as an insecurities-ridden teen, Sophie states: 'Stop dieting, you're 12. Go outside and live. 'And tell your High school bully and resident mean girl to f*** off. She doesn't know you or what you're capable of, and you'll rise above. 'She can watch from the nosebleed seats. But forgive her, she has her own struggles.' Finally: 'Don't let any boy, man - or woman for that matter - tell you what you need, want, should do, can do or can't do. Those are all your decisions to make.'","Sophie Tweed-Simmons is a model, actress, musician and strong advocate for healthy body image .

"Her straw and mud hut looks more suited to Bilbo Baggins. But unlike the wandering hobbit, Oxford University graduate Emma Orbach is staying firmly put. The 58-year-old has spent the past 13 years living with no electricity in her self-built roundhouse, generating her own power and growing her own food. Scroll down for video . Enjoying a night in: Oxford graduate Emma Orbach plays the Celtic harp in her hobbit-style mud and straw roundhouse in the Welsh mountains . Independent life: Emma collects firewood for her eco-home which lacks electricity and running water . Her daily chores involve tending to . her vegetable plot and collecting fruit, looking after her three goats, . seven chickens and two horses and chopping firewood. She gets her drinking water from a nearby stream and only rarely ventures to the shops for treats like rice and chocolate. Her evenings are spent in the glow of her stove, cooking her dinner and playing music on her Celtic harp. The vegetarian then retires to her wool-stuffed mattress and wool covers at about 7.30pm. Mrs Orbach said: ‘This is how I want to live. This lifestyle makes me feel really happy and at peace and this is my ideal home.’ Unassuming: The hobbit-like roundhouse has been named Tir Ysbrydol which means 'spirit land' in Welsh . Living off the earth: Emma has banned modern technology from her mountain home . The simple life: Emma keeps seven chickens, three goats and two horses at her eco-hut . Nestled in the mountains of West Wales, she named her home Tir Ysbrydol, which means ‘spirit land’ in Welsh. When . her children, who are in their 20s and 30s and live in  London, Bristol . and Brighton, visit, they, like all guests at the roundhouse, are . banned from bringing technology such as phones or laptops with them. It . is all a far cry from the conventional trappings of Mrs Orbach’s . background. Her father was a violinist and her mother a librarian. After . graduating from Oxford  with a degree in Chinese, she  married . architectural historian Julian Orbach. Together they founded the Brithdir Mawr . eco-community in the Preseli Mountains near Newport, in Pembrokeshire, . round a 180-acre farm in 1993. Animal care: Emma milks one of her three goats as part of her daily routine . One with nature: Emma gets her water from a nearby stream, chops her own firewood and only ventures to a shop to buy special treats such as chocolate . For five years they enjoyed a simple life, then a survey plane chanced upon the ‘lost tribe’ and they were plunged into a decade-long battle with officialdom. Officials were unable to find any records, let alone planning permission, for the mystery hillside village surrounded by trees and bushes and insisted the eight grass-covered buildings should be demolished. The eco-community endured a decade of . inquiries, court cases and a planning hearing before their fight, backed . by more modern support for green issues, finally ended in victory in . 2008 when the roundhouses were given planning approval. But . by then Mr and Mrs Orbach had divorced and the commune split into three . entities, including hers. Each community is independent and they . co-exist as neighbours in a more traditional style. Explaining why she . set up her own home just before 2000, Mrs Orbach said she felt a ‘very . strong pull to live life even more simply’. Teatime: Emma makes a brew on her open fire, adding milk from her own goat . No stress: Emma relaxes in front of the fire in her hut before she heads to bed when it darkens outside at around 7.30 pm . She is in the process of building a sixth roundhouse there and has permission from the council to build four more, as well as a sauna, workshop and community building. She runs a ‘healing and retreat centre’ on the site and usually has about five people living in the other roundhouses. They pay her a donation, which covers her £63-a-month council tax payments, repair costs and supplies of grain. She said: ‘I don’t miss anything at all about what is normally called reality. The quality of life, in my view, is decreasing and everything is speeding up and becoming  more stressful. ‘Once or twice I have joked about getting a takeaway pizza delivered here when I am tired after a long day.

One beauty brand is set to take mascara to a whole new level - by launching a product that promises to last three days - throughout showering, sleep - and even swimming. Max Factor have unveiled Lashfinity 3 Day Mascara on the back of (admittedly slightly dubious) research that revealed 60 per cent of women would rather have a wardrobe malfunction, forget to clean their teeth or put on deodorant than be caught without mascara. Endurance: Max Factor are unveiling a mascara they promise will last three whole days and won't budge in water or during sleep . Max Factor hope the 72-hour mascara, which will be sold in Boots, will become a beauty bag essential for summer. No other product, as yet, can promise to stay put under such extreme conditions.. Max Factor, who are dubbing the £18.99 mascara 'life proof', say the formula is flake-resistant, wax-free and with a 'PermaHold' technology that gently bonds to the lash, creating what they say is a 'patent-like', jet-black finish, thanks to so-called 'lash-tint' technology. Max Factor make-up artist Mel Arter said: 'Lashfinity 3 Day Mascara is totally unique to mass cosmetics and a remarkable product. Long-lasting: Using 'lash tint' technology, designed to give a super jet black lash, Max Factor are dubbing this £18.99 mascara 'life proof' 'Never before have I seen mascara that acts likes a semi-permanent lash tint. It's an outstanding innovation. 'Applied in exactly the same way to a mascara, the formula coats and tints each lash to give darkness and definition that lasts an incredible three days. 'It’s a massive inspiration for women who don’t want to get caught without make-up.' And it seems that the hype surrounding the innovative product is really taking off. Four hundred beauty aficionados joined the waiting list within hours of it opening yesterday. Max Factor aren't the first brand to unveil a product that promises to last for several days. Right Guard Women Xtreme Dry Ultra Cool Maximum Strength is an Anti-Perspirant deodorant scientifically proven to give 72h protection. Surely it just makes more sense to have a quick shower?","Max Factor have unveiled Lashfinity 3 Day Mascara .

"For the youths of Gurgaon, a wealthy suburb of New Delhi known as 'Millenium City', Prison nightclub is a Shangri-La of cheap booze, gyrating young women and pumping Punjabi pop. But before the waxed and preened sons of India's middle class can gain entry to this earthly Paradise, they have to pass through a wall of muscle, the likes of which you wouldn't expect in this land of vegetarians and spirituality. Beefy, square-jawed, arms the size of an average man's thighs, although they are a far cry from the slim stereotype of an Indian man, these bouncers perhaps have little to outwardly distinguish them from their counterparts all over the world. It gets weird when you realise they all come from the same village - and most of them share the common surname, Tanwar. Bouncer: Vijay Tanwar stands with another bouncer outside a pub on June 17, 2014 in New Delhi, India . A few kilometres south, the twin urban village of Asola-Fatehpur Beri, near southern Delhi's exclusive VIP farmhouse belt, Chhatarpur, breeds bouncers. Vijay Tanwar, head trainer at the local wrestling school, or ‘akhada’, told India Today: 'In this village, there is not a single boy who does not go to the gym. 'All boys exercise. They are very careful towards their body. No one drinks and no-one consumes tobacco.' His boasts are perhaps a bit of an exaggeration. But physical fitness has long been a way of life for the young men of Asola-Fatehpur Beri, where wrestling has always been popular. Many hoped - and still do - that their skills and strength would take them to the Olympics, or careers as professional sportsmen. But whereas most who did not would have once ended up as farmers, soaring land values around India's capital have done for the cattle grazing land and fields of crops they once tended. Now, to make a living, for many the best option is to take up what is locally known as 'bouncery'. Two bouncers work out in Asola's gym, where they build the muscles that earn them a living in local clubs . Sweat suffuses the T-shirt of this bouncer as be lifts two heavy weights for a dumbbell bench press . More than 200 men from these villages work on the doors of the pubs, bars and nightclubs of the national capital, act as bodyguards to local dignitaries, or secure private colleges, hospitals and upmarket hotels. For them, their bodies are their livelihoods, and they spend their spare time maintaining them with long, arduous sessions in the gym and prodigious feeding sessions to provide the raw materials for muscular growth. Their efforts can earn them a good living. Employers are willing to pay as much as Rs50,000 ($835) a month for the most intimidating musclemen, in a country where the average monthly income is just $100 - and for many far less. But their talents are preferred to armed guards, whose gunplay can lead to unseemly scandals. Mushtaq Khan, who works at a private college in Chhatarpur, told the Calcutta Telegraph: 'Our bulging muscles and the glare in our eyes are enough to warn troublemakers.' 'When you come up against someone twice your size, you will think twice before taking him on,' he said. A wrestler does push ups at Asola's akhara. Traditional skills are important to the bouncers, who work unarmed . Trainees pose for a group photo at the akhara. With more youngsters craving lean, fashion model-like muscles, the village's reputation as a breeding ground for beefcakes is now under threat . Asola's gym, a 3,000sq/ft cement building lined with machines, racks and weights benches where the young men spend hours a day sweating and heaving for their muscles, opens at 4am and closes only at 10pm. It's proprietor, Raj Tanwar, boasts that his boys are 'the best in Delhi'. But becoming a bouncer is not easy. Youngsters face gruelling workout sessions lasting as long as two or three hours a day. It's not all pumping iron, their regimens also include hours of wrestling practice and yoga, and Vijay insists that they study up to class 12 before taking up security jobs. With many among them vegetarian, they must also follow specifically mandated diets to get the protein they need to bulk up. 'My suggestion is they drink at least three to four liters of milk a day,' Vijay told the BBC. 'A dozen bananas and around half a kilo of fruit. During lunch, they also consume 1.5 to 2 kilograms of yogurt with three to four pieces of flatbread. In the evening, they should have two pieces of flatbread and one to 1.5 kilograms of almond-infused milk.' Meat eaters can consume an entire boiled chicken, 10 egg whites, a dozen bananas, and 10 litres of milk a day. But just as the Asola-Fatehpur Beri's fashion for security work has emerged from changes to Indian society, new trends are threatening its future. Vijay is particularly concerned about a new film which has had a bad influence on local youths. 'Ever since they've seen Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, they crave sixpacks. They want to be lean,' he sniffs. Sachin Chauhan, 22, is one of those corrupted by popular culture. He trains every day, but is also pursuing a degree in business administration at a local college. But, as he told the Calcutta Telegraph, his ambitions have little to do with balance sheets or door work. 'I want to become a model,' he said.","Asola-Fatehpur Beri, south of New Delhi, is famous for security men .
They can earn up to eight times the average national wage being bouncers .
But some influenced by popular culture now want to build lean muscles ."
"The dramatic moment a policeman shoots dead a man’s beloved pet dog while responding to an emergency call at the wrong address has been released on the internet. Footage from the patrol car’s dashboard camera captures the shot ring out milliseconds after the officer shouts: ‘Show me your hands, show me your hands. Get your dog.’ Owner Michael Paxton, 40, can be heard crying out: ‘Don't shoot my dog. What are you doing, what did you shoot my dog for? What are you doing? I live here.' Scroll down for video . Tragic: Michael Paxton,left, says the officer, who responded to the wrong address, startled his dog Cisco, right, which is why he started barking . Shocked: Footage from the police patrol car captures the sound of Michael Paxton's dog Cisco being shot dead . ‘I didn't know you were here I was just taking him into the yard. Oh my god, I can't believe you just shot my dog. 'I need to give him to the vet. What . are you doing here?,’ adding ‘thanks for shooting my best friend’, you . killed my best friend'. He then says: 'Thanks for pulling a gun on me in my own driveway . for no reason.' He says he was playing Frisbee with . his seven-year-old Australian cattle dog, Cisco, at his home in Austin, . Texas, when a police officer suddenly appeared, drew his weapon and . ordered him to put his hands up. It is understood the police were responding to a domestic abuse call of a man . choking a woman and had unknowingly arrived at Paxton's home after the . 911 caller gave the wrong address. Mr Paxton has launched a Facebook . campaign called “Justice for Cisco” in to put pressure on Austin police . over dog shooting’. On the recording uploaded to YouTube, . the police officer can be heard explaining his version of events moments after the shooting to a . colleague at the scene. He said: ‘I came round the corner. He [Paxton] walks from behind that tree, I tell him to show me his hands. Dog comes . flying out of nowhere, dude, comes straight up at me, jumps at me and I . popped it.’ The officer asks several times 'do you have a girlfriend?' before telling Mr Paxton the dog should have been on a leash. Campaign: The Facebook page named Justice For Cisco, which was created yesterday, has had more than 26,000 likes and hundreds of messages of support, outrage and anger . The footage from the police car does not capture footage of the actual events, only the audio. But since being uploaded yesterday, it has been viewed more than 16,000 times. Mr Paxton yesterday described the moment he was confronted in his front yard by an officer with his gun drawn. He said: . ‘He had a Taser. He had pepper spray. I don't understand why, in broad . daylight, he pulled a gun on me. I wasn't running. I wasn't hiding,’ Paxton told ABCNews.com. ‘I was just saying, ""I live here."" I was panicking. I was afraid for my life.’ 'While I was at gunpoint, my dog came . from my backyard barking at the officer,' Paxton wrote on the Facebook . page dedicated to Cisco’s cause. 'I . yelled for the officer to not shoot my dog, that he will not bite, but . the officer immediately shot and killed my dog right in front of me.' The . Facebook page named Justice For Cisco, which was created yesterday, has . had more than 26,000 likes and hundreds of messages of support, outrage . and anger. One person named Todd Hariaczyi said: 'I cannot begin to imagine your loss. I have had dogs my entire life, and I cannot fathom losing one in such a horrible manner. 'I am disgusted by the officer's actions--shoot now, ask later--and his attempt to blame you for the entire ordeal. It's your property! Of course, your dog is on it. I will refrain from expressing how I feel about him because it's nothing I can repeat here. I hope you get the justice you deserve.' Another, named Nick Pound, added: 'The officer needs to not only be fired, but charged like any other person who would shoot and kill an animal. Felony animal cruelty in most states carries up to 5 years in prison.' Paxton said Cisco was harmless and had never bitten or attacked anybody before. 'The only thing that has brought me comfort is the response and outpouring of emotion for him,' he told ABCNews.com. Shooter: The Austin Police Department said the officer, pictured, had felt threatened after the dog came at him and barked . 'I'm sure he heard the yelling. He's a dog. This is his territory. He's going to be territorial to some extent. To me, it's pretty typical dog behavior. He's not a viscious dog. He was a good boy. He was a real good boy.' The Austin Police Department said the officer felt threatened after the dog charged at him and barked, leaving him with no alternative. 'Officers have to do everything they can to protect themselves, up to and including the use of deadly force,' Austin Police Cpl. Anthony Hipolito told ABCNews. com . 'It's something that we don't ever want to do. To shoot and kill an animal is very unfortunate and tragic. The officer is distraught and did not want to do it, but at the same time, he had to protect himself.'

"President Obama's much-talked-about tan suit was the first order of business on Friday when White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest revealed the president 'feels pretty good' about the choice. Rather than address  matters such as the crises in Syria and Iraq, Earnest started Friday's media briefing with comments about the tan suit, which Obama wore on Thursday. 'The president stands squarely behind the decision that he made yesterday to wear his summer suit at yesterday's news conference,' Josh Earnest said. 'It's the Thursday before Labor Day.' When asked why he wasn't wearing a summer suit himself, Earnest joked that he had 'contemplated it' but it 'seemed like it might be a little too much,' he said. Fifty Shades of Beige: President Obama caused a minor meltdown on Twitter by donning a taupe suit paired with a grey tie to a press conference about ISIS and the Ukraine . First order of business: White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, pictured on Friday, spoke about President Obama's decision to wear a tan suit on Thursday before getting to more important matters . The president's questionable fashion choice had set Twitter abuzz with memes and jokes at the president's expense after his appearance on Thursday. As well as inspiring jokes, it also incited anger from New York Rep. Peter King, who lambasted the president's decision to wear the suit when he had serious matters to discuss. 'There’s no way any of us can excuse what the president did yesterday,' he said on NewsMaxTV. Should President Obama have worn a taupe suit to talk about ISIS? Should President Obama have worn a taupe suit to talk about ISIS? Now share your opinion . He explained that it was not appropriate for the president to wear a 'light tan suit' or talk about the economy when Americans really wanted to know about his strategy for ISIS. 'For him to walk out — I’m not trying to be trivial here — in a light suit, light tan suit, saying that first he wants to talk about... the revision of second quarter numbers on the economy. 'This is a week after Jim Foley was beheaded and he's trying to act like real Americans care about the economy, not about ISIS and not about terrorism. Then he goes on to say he has no strategy.' Online, some users praised the fashion-forward leader of the free world for his bold selection, while others suggested that the taupe two-piece number, paired with a crisp white shirt and a striped grey tie, was not an appropriate ensemble for the occasion. Before long, three new accounts popped up on Twitter dedicated to Mr Obama’s khaki getup. Members of the media on the left and the right rushed to put in their two cents about the show-stealing tan suit. Online zingers: Commentators took to Twitter to poke fun at Mr Obama's unorthodox sartorial choice . Dog days of summer: Twitter users joked that the president wanted to don the light-colored suit before Labor Day, which marks the cutoff point for wearing summery hues . Imaginary conversation: User Eric Schroeck even wrote a dialogue between Obama and Joe Biden about the infamous suit . Weighing in: Twitter users wondered what Hilary Clinton might make of the whole debacle . That didn't take long: At least three Twitter accounts have been created in honor of Obama's tan suit . Josh Barro, with the New York Times, quipped: 'Obama vows to defeat whoever made him wear this suit.' Philip Klein, of Washington Examiner, jokingly remarked: 'this is what happens when Obama bypasses Congress to purchase a suit.' Meanwhile, conservative pundit Michelle Malkin did not miss a chance to take a potshot at the president, tweeting: 'I don't care that Obama's suit is tan. The problem with the suit that it's EMPTY.' It's been pointed out on Twitter that Mr Obama decided to break out the controversial outfit just days before Labor Day - the traditional cut-off point for wearing white and other light hues. Unflattering comparison: Obama's critics compared him to a used car salesman . Quiet, everyone: Obama doesn't seem too impressed with the attention his suit is getting . Priorities: Journalist David Wyllie joked about where America needs to intervene most . The sight of the taupe two-piece brought to mind the wardrobe of a real estate agent . Who wore it best? Obama's outfit was similar to the suit worn by Morgan Freeman (left) in the film Lean on Me . One Twitter user suggested that the poor wardrobe choice was one of Obama's better decisions . Journalist Matt Viser, who covers the White House for The Boston Globe, revealed on Twitter that Obama has worn a tan suite on Easter Sunday this year. Some people have unfavorably compared the khaki-clad president to a church deacon, an insurance salesmen and a real estate agent. User Scott Lofquist went so far as to Photoshop the logo of the real estate company Century 21 onto the president's jacket. But Rep John Dingell, the 88-year-old Democratic congressman from Colorado who himself is no stranger to light-colored formal wear, came to the president's defense. 'I see no problem with the suit,' he tweeted. The great Twitter freakout over Obama’s suit was marked by amusing and mildly clever puns, among them ‘yes, we tan’ and ‘the audacity of taupe’ - a play on the title of the president’s bestseller The Audacity of Hope. Octogenarian fashionista: Congressman John Dingell, 88, came to the president's defense . Support: A few Twitter users came to the President's defense, however . You're fooling no one, Obama: One Twitter user suggests the President wanted us to ignore his speech . Unlucky: Within minutes, Twitter was abuzz with thousands of comments about Obama's choice . Skewed priorities: Some Twitter commenters fumed that the public should be paying attention to the president's words rather than to his clothes . When he is not playing golf on Martha's Vineyard or vacationing in Hawaii, Mr Obama has been known to wear dark, sober colors to press conferences and town hall meetings. Speaking to Vanity Fair in 2012, the president addressed his approach to sartorial choices. ‘You'll see I wear only grey or blue suits,’ Obama told the magazine. ‘I'm trying to pare down decisions. I don't want to make decisions about what I’m eating or wearing. Because I have too many other decisions to make.’ The outpouring of snide comments about the beige ensemble donned by the president for the press conference provoked anger in some quarters, with commenters like NBC News’ Louis Dubois fuming that constituents should be paying attention to what Obama says rather than to the color of his suit. ‘Obama is talking about ISIS, Ukraine, immigration and more here. You know, ""news."" Yet people are talking about a tan suit,’ he wrote.","President Obama was mocked online on Thursday for wearing a tan suit, which was likened to a suit worn by a used car salesman or a Realtor .
On Thursday, Josh Earnest addressed the fashion choice before talking about slightly more pressing matters, including Iraq and Syria ."
"A garter pistol which one of Britain’s most notorious gangsters used to hide in his sock has been put up for auction, along with the garters used to secure it. Ronnie Kray’s 'mutt gun' - now safely decommissioned - will be auctioned in Northamptonshire next Tuesday. Exactly what the ten cm-long pistol was used for is not known, but it was passed on to his second wife, Kate Howard, in 1987, shortly before she married the then-ageing (not to mention imprisoned) mobster. This garter pistol belonged to notorious gangster, Ronnie Kray, and is up for sale at Towcester next week . These sock gaiters, or garters, which Ronnie Kray used to keep his socks up, are also included in the sale . Auctioneer Jonathan Humbert, who will sell the gun and garters in Towcester later this month, said: 'This really is the quintessential gangster’s item - and one with superb provenance and quite a history.' Kate Kray, who received the items from an associate of her husband's, said: 'Charlie Clarke dropped off an enormous tea chest for me. 'It was full of Ron's stuff, from dinner suits and cufflinks to a bayonet and the gun, from before Ron went inside in 1968.' She added: 'Charlie was known as the Catman, was murdered in Dover a month or so after giving me the tea chest.  I don't know why and I never asked.' The gun, which has a walnut stock with nickel-plated barrel, is just one of 150 pieces of Kray memorabilia up for auction. Thugs: The Krays, pictured at home in 1966 after being quizzed by police about the murder of George Cornell . Ronnie and his twin Reggie headed a criminal empire which ruled much of London with an iron fist during the 1950s and 60s. In 1966 Ronnie shot George Cornell, an associate of rival London gang, the Richardsons, dead in the Blind Beggar pub in Whitechapel.  Cornell is said to have remarked 'Well, look who's here' just before he was shot. But despite involvement in murders, armed robberies, racketeering and other crimes, the Krays became celebrities through their nightclub ownership and by mingling with some of the biggest stars of the day, including Dolly Parton and Frank Sinatra. Justice finally caught up with them and they were sentenced to life in prison in 1968.  The judge, Mr Justice Melford Stevenson, told them: 'In my view, society has earned a rest from your activities.' They were . allowed out of prison for their mother's funeral in 1982, but Ronnie . died in Broadmoor, aged 61 in 1995, and Reggie, died at 66, in 2000, a . few weeks after being allowed out on compassionate leave.","Garter pistol belonged to the more violent of the twin East End mobsters .

"Our schools are simply not set up to accommodate very high proportions of children who start without fluent English. The highly standardised curriculum continues to present a one-size-fits-all roadblock, preventing teachers from addressing pupils’ actual needs. Having been a child who doesn’t speak the local language twice – in both a Greek and an Albanian school – as well being as a teacher in an East London primary school where many pupils did not speak English, I have seen both sides of the coin. Scroll down for video . A former teacher and deputy director of the Civitas Think-Tank says schools cannot accommodate large numbers of non-English speakers . In my Greek and Albanian schools, the focus was on learning the language before everything else. But when I was teaching a decade ago, children were not given the same level of support, and were often left to muddle along. Anastasia de Waal, who believes schools have been failing children for years . Some progress has been made since then, but trying to ‘press on’ and not address poor English is a lose-lose situation for everyone, including native English speakers. The pupils who don’t receive opportunities to develop their language skills risk going through the education system with a major disadvantage. In turn, those who speak English can end up being neglected in classrooms where teachers are struggling to cope with weak language skills. Whether you’re happy or unhappy with immigration levels, it’s a straightforward reality that many children in this country begin primary school speaking a different mother tongue. Policymakers’ failure to properly address this is an extraordinary oversight. Ignoring English in schools simply makes no sense. For those championing the opportunities of immigrants, a strong command of English is imperative to making a successful life in this country. For those less embracing of multi-culturalism, a common language is crucial to help maintain a sense of unity. This country has never been very good at languages. But perhaps we could at least improve the command of our own.","Anastasia de Waal says schools can't cope with non- English speakers .

"A desperate victim of ‘locked-in’ syndrome broke down in tears yesterday after losing his landmark legal battle for the right to end  his life when he chooses with a doctor’s help. Tony Nicklinson had to be comforted by his wife Jane, who said her husband was ‘absolutely heartbroken’. Mr Nicklinson said he had been condemned by the law to ‘a life of increasing indignity and misery’. Pain: Mr Nicklinson is comforted by his wife after the decision today. She has supported him in his quest to win the right to die at home . The 58-year-old father of two from Melksham, Wiltshire, is mentally sound but paralysed from the neck down and unable to speak. For the past seven years he has not . been able to move anything apart from his head and eyes following a . severe stroke while on a business trip to Athens. His only means of . communication is via a computer triggered by blinks and head movements. Mr Nicklinson has been battling for . two years to persuade three judges at the High Court to rule that if, . and when, he decides he wants to die, doctors will be immune from . prosecution if they help him. Yesterday they gave him the . devastating news that only Parliament can change the law of murder so . that doctors or helpers can step in to assist someone to die. Harrowing: The pain clear to see, Tony Nicklinson breaks down in tears today after being told that he will not be granted the right to die . Mr Nicklinson today vowed to appeal the decision, despite the 'physical discomfort, misery and mental anguish' this will bring him and his family . Heartache: Mr Nicklinson cries at the computer he uses to speak through. He was once an active man but has become incapable of even basic tasks after his stroke . The judges . said that if no doctor was allowed to help Mr Nicklinson die, then his . only option would be to die by starvation. The ruling means that . 58-year-old Mr Nicklinson faces decades entirely dependent on others to . care for his every need. However his wife said they would appeal. She and their grown-up daughters Lauren and Beth all support his legal battle. Speaking through his computer, Mr Nicklinson said: ‘I am devastated by the court’s decision. ‘Although I didn’t want to raise my . hopes, it happened anyway because a fantastic amount of work went into . my case and I thought that if the court saw me as I am, utterly . miserable with my life, powerless to do anything about it because of my . disability, then the judges would accept my reasoning that I do not want . to carry on and should be able to have a dignified death. ‘I am saddened that the law wants to condemn me to a life of increasing indignity and misery.’ Tony Nicklinson, 'locked-in syndrome' sufferer at home in Melksham, Wiltshire, and right,  with daughter Beth  in 1989 . Supportive: Mr Nicklinson's wife Jane (centre) and daughters Beth (left) and Lauren (right) at the High Court in London at an earlier hearing . Mrs Nicklinson, 56, said: ‘Tony has to either carry on like this until he dies of natural causes or  starves himself.’ Right-to-life campaigners said the . ruling would protect the vulnerable from pressure to commit suicide or . from involuntary euthanasia. Mr Nicklinson’s case was a joint one . with a 47-year-old known only as Martin because his family wishes to . preserve their privacy. He suffered a stroke four years ago and is unable to speak or move, except for small movements of his head and eyes. Lord Justice Toulson, sitting with Mr . Justice Royce and Mrs Justice Macur, rejected the claim of both men that . they should be allowed help with death under Article Eight of the . European human rights charter, which guarantees the right to private and . family life. Martin’s claim that the Director of . Public Prosecutions must be asked to publish new guidelines allowing . others to help him die was also rejected. Mr Nicklinson, with his wife Jane, at their adapted home. He will appeal today's ruling that doctors cannot help him to end his life . Mr Nicklinson shares a rare moment of laughter with Jane. He wants to die at home surrounded by his friends and family rather than thousands of miles away at a legal clinic . Ruling halts the rush to change law . Lord Justice Toulson described the men’s cases as ‘tragic’. He said their plight was ‘deeply . moving’, but added: ‘Their desire to have control over the ending of . their lives demands the most  careful and sympathetic consideration, but . there are also other important issues to consider. 'A decision to allow . their claims would have consequences far beyond the present cases. ‘It is not for the court to decide . whether the law about assisted dying should be changed and, if so, what . safeguards should be put in place. ‘Under our system of government these . are matters for Parliament to decide, representing society as a whole, . after Parliamentary scrutiny, and not for the court on the facts of an . individual case or cases.’ The judge said Mr Nicklinson ‘wants to be . able to choose to end his life by voluntary euthanasia.’ ‘This does not mean that he . necessarily wants to end his life immediately. 'At the moment he thinks . that he would probably wish to end it in a year or two, but he wants to . establish the right to die with dignity at a time of his choosing’.

However, Martin’s wife, a nurse, was . unwilling to help him die. 'His options under current law are either to . travel to the Dignitas clinic in Zurich to get help with suicide, or to . starve himself. Mrs Nicklinson said her husband was reluctant to go to the  Dignitas clinic. ‘We could do Switzerland but it’s very . expensive and he doesn’t see why the hell he should have to go to a . foreign country to die in the middle of an industrial estate,’  she . said. Right-to-life campaigner Dr Andrew . Fergusson of the Care Not Killing Alliance said the ruling ‘confirms the . simple truth that the current law exists to protect those without a . voice: the disabled, terminally ill and elderly, who might otherwise . feel pressured into ending their lives.’ He added: ‘It confirms the view that . even in a free democratic society there are limits to choice. Every law . limits choice and stops some people doing what they might desperately . wish to do, but this is necessary in order to protect others, especially . the most vulnerable in our society. ‘Hopefully the decision to reject both . cases will now draw a line once and for all under legal debate and . allow decision-makers and society to focus attention on how we care for . the terminally ill and severely disabled.

"A former high school quarterback followed in the steps of one-time pro and college players Saturday by suing a sports governing body — in this case the Illinois High School Association — saying it didn't do enough to protect him from concussions when he played and still doesn't do enough to protect current players. The lawsuit, filed in Cook County Circuit Cook on the same day Illinois wrapped up its last high school football championship games, is the first instance in which legal action has been taken for former high school players as a whole against a group responsible for prep sports in a state. Such litigation could snowball, as similar suits targeting associations in other states are planned. The lead plaintiff is Daniel Bukal, a star quarterback at Notre Dame College Prep in Niles until 2003. He received multiple concussions at the suburban Chicago school and, a decade on, still suffers frequent migraines and some memory loss, according to the 51-page suit. Bukal didn't play beyond high school. Attorneys: Joseph Siprut, left, attorney to Daniel Bukal, a star quarterback at Notre Dame College Prep in Niles from 1999 to 2003, listens while attorney Steve Berman speaks at a news conference (file photo) The IHSA did not have concussion protocols in place, putting Bukal and other high school players at risk, and those protocols remain deficient, the lawsuit alleges. It calls on the Bloomington-based IHSA to tighten its rules regarding head injuries at the 800 high schools it oversees. It doesn't seek specific monetary damages. 'In Illinois high school football, responsibility — and, ultimately, fault — for the historically poor management of concussions begins with the IHSA,' the lawsuit states. It calls high school concussions 'an epidemic' and says the 'most important battle being waged on high school football fields ... is the battle for the health and lives of' young players. In a brief emailed statement, IHSA Executive Director Marty Hickman said he wanted to keep the spotlight Saturday on the playoff finals. But he said concussion management is 'a top priority' and that the IHSA 'will continue to be a leader' in reducing head-injury risks. Bukal's Chicago-based attorney Joseph Siprut, who filed a similar lawsuit against the NCAA in 2011, provided an advance copy of the new lawsuit to The Associated Press. The college sports governing body agreed this year to settle the NCAA lawsuit, including by committing $70 million for a medical monitoring program to test athletes for brain trauma. The deal is awaiting a judge's approval. The IHSA lawsuit seeks similar medical monitoring of Illinois high school football players, though it doesn't spell out how such a program would operate. It contends new regulations should include mandatory baseline testing of all players before each season to help determine the severity of any concussion during the season. High school football isn't overseen by a single national body equivalent to the NCAA, but rather by school boards, state law and 50 separate associations (file photo) Missing: The lawsuit came as the Ohio State stadium went silent Saturday as an announcer called out the name of missing football player Kosta Karageorge, pictured, whose mother says he texted her about prior concussions the day he disappeared . The lawsuit only targets the Illinois association. High school football isn't overseen by a single national body equivalent to the NCAA, but rather by school boards, state law and 50 separate associations. Siprut says he intends to file suits against other state governing bodies. Washington was the first state to pass laws addressing sports concussions in children in 2009, including by barring concussed players from returning to the same game. All 50 states have now adopted such laws. But the new lawsuit alleges governing bodies, like the IHSA, have had patchy implementation of state mandates. Around 140,000 out of nearly 8 million high school athletes have concussions every year, most of them football players, according to the National Federation of State High School Associations. Some estimates put the number of concussions much higher. Eight high school students died directly from playing football in 2013 — six from head and two from neck injuries — while there were none last year in college or professional football, a 2014 report by National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research says. Speaking Saturday, Siprut said the legal action wasn't intended to undermine America's most popular sport. 'This is not a threat or attack on football,' he said. 'Football is in danger in Illinois and other states — especially at the high school level — because of how dangerous it is. If football does not change internally, it will die. The talent well will dry up as parents keep kids out of the sport— and that's how a sport dies.' The lawsuit came as the Ohio State stadium went silent Saturday as an announcer called out the name of a missing football player and a police poster seeking information on his disappearance appeared on a monitor. Twenty-two-year-old Kosta Karageorge was the last of 24 OSU players recognized before the Buckeyes' game against rival Michigan on Saturday. His family says he was last seen Wednesday. Karageorge's mother says he texted her about his prior concussions the morning he disappeared. The players recognized were mostly seniors making their final appearance for the Buckeyes at the team's last home game of the season. The announcer said the entire university community was concerned about Karageorge and hoping for his safe return. Polite applause from among the 105,000 fans broke the silence at the end of the recognition.","Lead plaintiff Daniel Bukal, a star quarterback at Notre Dame College Prep in Niles until 2003, sued the Illinois High School Association on Saturday .

"Move on: Former Prime Minister John Major said every couple should have the opportunity to marry . Tory traditionalists should accept ‘we live in the 21st century’ and back gay marriage, Sir John Major said yesterday. Amid increasing signs of a party split over legislation to be outlined this week, he will hail David Cameron’s ‘courageous and genuine’ campaign to give same-sex couples equal rights. The former prime minister’s intervention came after senior Tories, including Michael Gove, Boris Johnson and Scottish leader Ruth Davidson, who is a lesbian, launched a group in support of gay marriage. Last month, the Daily Mail revealed that 118 of the party’s 303 MPs, had expressed some level of concern about the proposed gay marriage legislation in correspondence with constituents, though not all will vote against it. A further 12 MPs are also understood to have expressed doubts. But Mr Johnson said the argument had gone on long enough and urged the Prime Minister to get on and ‘whack it through’. ‘The Labour Party will vote for it, the Liberals will vote for it, huge numbers of Tories will vote for it – whack it through, let’s knock this thing on the head,’ the London mayor told Sky News yesterday. ‘Nobody is calling for any change to any religious practice whatever and it is pretty clear from what the Prime Minister has said that no religion is going to be under any compulsion to do anything to change their observances.’ In a rare intervention in day-to-day politics, Sir John will today argue that society must ‘move on’ and permit gay couples to wed. ‘The Prime Minister’s instinct to support equal marriage is a courageous and genuine attempt to offer security and comfort to people who – at present – may be together, yet feel apart,’ he will say. ‘I fully understand that there are many who will find this difficult to accept, as will the churches. But the Prime Minister has made it clear that the churches will be free to make their own decisions upon whether to conduct such marriages and that is entirely the right approach. We live in the 21st century and must move on. Every couple should have the opportunity and the right to formalise their relationship.’ Support: Nick Herbert, right, who is in a civil partnership, and Boris Johnson, left, have both backed gay marriage . Former Home Office minister Nick Herbert, who is in a civil partnership, and is among 19 senior Tories backing the campaign for rapid reform, said all those who wanted to strengthen the institution of marriage should be in favour. Rejecting the idea that legislating for gay unions was the wrong priority at a time when the coalition is focusing on the economy, Mr Herbert said: ‘Government can and should be able to do more than one thing at a time. ‘It needn’t take a lot of time but it is the right thing to do. Marriage is an important institution which should be cherished and promoted. It would be strengthened by the addition of same-sex couples. ‘Religious liberty is a fundamental principle and that should be protected, and no church should be forced to conduct same-sex marriage against its will.’ Other senior figures backing gay marriage include Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, who is Catholic, Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt, an evangelical Christian, and former Tory ministers Lord Fowler and Nicholas Soames. In a letter announcing the formation of the group, the 19 said: ‘Marriage should be open to all, regardless of sexuality.’ Tory Right-winger Peter Bone said the letter ‘implied most people who oppose the redefinition of marriage are homophobic’. ‘The Prime Minister is absolutely wrong on this,’ he added. ‘This cast iron guarantee he’s given that nobody will be forced, no church will be forced to marry is obviously false because the European courts will intervene. ‘What will happen when a couple go to a local church, same-sex, saying that they want to be married, that church turns them down, they’re off to the European Court and hey-ho, all churches will be forced to do it. ‘That’s what will happen and I don’t care what people say now, everyone knows that is what will happen down the line unless it is stopped. I just believe, as millions of people do in this country, that marriage is between a man and a woman.’ The legislation will include a clause designed to protect faith groups that do not want to perform same-sex marriages from legal challenges, while allowing those in favour to do so.","Former Prime Minister said every couple should have the chance to 'formalise' their relationship .

"The 'White Widow' Samantha Lewthwaite is being guarded by a squad of elite terrorists who are ready to kill anyone who goes near her, it was reported today. The British-born Muslim convert is on the run after she was suspected of helping coordinate the September attack on a Nairobi shopping mall in which 67 people were killed. Reports suggest she is now being protected by a band of loyal al-Qaeda fighters, who move her between locations on camel or donkey to avoid detection. British-born Samantha Lewthwaite is believed to be a member of the al-Shabaab terror group in Somalia . It is said a group of fighters, like those pictured, now protects her and have threatened any locals that come near them . Mother-of-four Lewthwaite, 30, originally from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, is said to be one of the leading players in Somalia's radical al-Shabaab group, which is linked to al-Qaeda. The Daily Mirror reported today she is 'prized' by the group and is being looked after by a well-trained band of men, who clothe their whole bodies apart from their eyes and have threatened locals not to come near them. A colonel from the Somalian National Army told the paper: 'She is being protected by some of their best fighters. They are moving her all the time, sometimes by camel or donkey.' The most recent sighting of the Briton is believed to have been when she moved by camel to Baidoa, where the Somali National Army is fighting a group of approximately 8,000 terrorists. Lewthwaite has become one of the world's most wanted women following her suspected involvement in a deadly attack on a shopping mall in Kenya. Pictured - An arrest warrant for her on Interpol's website . It is claimed she is now 'prized' among al Shabaab fighters, who are believed to have carried out more attacks in Kenya at the weekend . It was reported today that her group stay on the move to avoid a force of 10,000 troops sent to the troubled region by the UN. Samantha Lewthwaite is the widow of 7/7 bomber . Germaine Lindsay, who blew himself up on a Piccadilly Line train between . King's Cross St Pancras and Russell Square stations. She was the daughter of a former soldier before converting to Islam. The British Muslim . convert is linked to the Westgate Mall massacre in Nairobi in which 67 . people were killed, and is thought to be hiding in Somalia. Interpol . issued a 'Red Notice' warrant for her arrest shortly after the attacks . for terrorist offences in Mombasa dating back to 2011. The 29-year-old is . the world's most wanted woman after being accused of allegedly ordering . the killings of two radical Muslim clerics, two Protestant preachers, . and three others with links to al-Shabaab. They are reportedly living in forests and caves and getting milk from nomadic farmers in the region. It has been . claimed Lewthwaite, the widow of 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay, is . among those planning revenge attacks following the death of al-Qaeda . leader Abubakar Shariff Ahmed. Ahmed was . killed by unidentified gunmen last month as he and a friend were walking . from a court in Mombasa, Kenya to a nearby mosque. Ahmed, . who had denied meeting Lewthwaite, was suspected of helping more than . 100 Britons to join al-Shabaab, which carried out the Westgate Mall . shootings in Kenya seven months ago. Since his death, Kenya has seen a rise in the number of attacks, with a series of bombings over the last week. Blasts . in Nairobi and Mombasa killed seven people this weekend and, though . they have not claimed responsibilty, al-Shabaab is suspected of being involved.

"Tristram Hunt has been told ‘you must do better with your policies’ in a scathing report from his former school headmaster. Labour’s Shadow Education Secretary triggered a furious political row last week when he warned top public schools they would lose £700 million if they didn’t help local state pupils. The plan was dismissed as ‘class war’ by critics. Tristram Hunt's former headmaster at the £17,835-a-year University College School in Hampstead said he was 'disappointed' that the Labour shadow education spokesman 'pictured' had such an 'unoriginal policy' But now Giles Slaughter, the retired headteacher who taught Mr Hunt at the £17,835-a-year University College School (UCS) in Hampstead, has issued his withering verdict. He dismisses the plan as ‘completely old hat’, saying it was first floated by Neil Kinnock, and that it would be a ‘seven-day wonder’. He has also ordered him to come up with better plans to improve the state sector. Mr Slaughter – who took over at UCS in 1983, before Mr Hunt entered the school – told The Mail on Sunday he was ‘disappointed’ that ‘such an intelligent, articulate and delightful man has come up with something so totally unoriginal’. Mr Slaughter said: ‘I would have expected more from him than this tired old saw, [such as] some proper ideas to improve schools.’ Mr Hunt, 40, angered private school headteachers by warning that under a Labour Government they would lose the tax breaks associated with their charitable status if they did not share teachers and facilities with local state schools. Giles Slaughter, pictured, said Neil Kinnock was calling for similar policies in the 1970s, describing Mr Hunt's plans for private schools as 'old hat' But Mr Slaughter, 77, who retired in 1996 and now has a building at the school named after him, said: ‘This is an idea which has been around for decades – I remember Neil Kinnock calling for it in the 1970s. It is completely old hat and I am rather sad about it, because Tristram was such an intelligent and charming pupil. ‘I think it will die on its feet and be just a seven-day wonder. Most independent schools are already doing exactly what they are required to do as charities.’ Mr Slaughter, who said he had ‘no idea’ whether Mr Hunt was reflecting his own beliefs or pushing a party line, added that UCS had always been ‘very active in the local community’ and that during the MP’s time at the school the boys were involved in charitable activities such as helping the elderly. UCS has forged links with three local state secondaries and several primaries, including help with Latin lessons and offering access to its swimming pool. More than nine out of ten independent schools are involved in similar partnerships. After Mr Hunt condemned the ‘Berlin Wall’ between private and state education, which he said had created a ‘corrosive divide of privilege’, the current UCS headmaster Mark Beard fought back by describing the policy as ‘odious bigotry’. Mr Beard said: ‘If Mr Hunt wanted to tastelessly quantify the value of public benefit that UCS generates each year then he would find that it far outstrips the value of tax relief.’ It triggered a very public war of words between Mr Hunt and the independent school sector. Some of his political opponents suspected the policy had been rushed out in order to appeal to Labour’s core vote and distract attention from the ‘snob’ row over former frontbencher Emily Thornberry’s Twitter message showing a flag-covered house in Rochester with a white van parked outside. Mr Hunt attended University College School in Hampstead, north London, pictured, in the late 80s, early 90s . Yesterday Mr Hunt stoked the row further by pledging a Labour Government would send Ofsted inspectors into private schools to check they were doing enough to help local ones. ‘If the militants of independent schools say “never” then we will have to think again and Ofsted could be an answer,’ he said. ‘Go through some of these schools’ accounts and it is so hard to find what they have done.’ Mr Hunt, whose father is Baron Hunt of Chesterton, left UCS in 1992 with two As and a B to read history at Trinity College, Cambridge. Last night he said: ‘The Labour Party remains committed to breaking down the barriers in our education system that stand in the way of opportunity and aspiration for all children. ‘We look forward to seeing more meaningful partnerships between state and private schools, and that is what this announcement is all about.’ It costs £5,462 to turn a new house into a home, according to a new study. The research shows that homeowners take weeks putting their stamp on a property before it feels like their own. Nearly half install a new bathroom or kitchen but, for a third, that moment comes with something as simple as putting up photos. Getting out the paintbrush is also a rite of passage, while 11 per cent say it’s when a letter arrives with their new address on, according to the survey by Barratt Homes. Kate Fox, from the Social Issues Research Centre, said: ‘Making a property feel like a home is really important. It’s just a shame that it can cost so much.’","Giles Slaughter became head teacher at University College School in 1983 .

Other stores are also selling an increasing number of imported American foods from brands including Reese, Hershey and Oreo that contain GM ingredients.

Last year, M&S, Tesco, Sainsbury’s and the Co-op abandoned pledges to ensure animals supplying milk, eggs, chicken, pork and beef were not fed a GM diet. It means some food on supermarket shelves comes from animals fed on GM crops, without this fact being declared on the label.

M&S and Tesco have a policy not to use GM ingredients in their own-label products, but it is now clear there are no such assurances for other brands. The TonTon sauce is the first GM food allowed on to M&S shelves, while Tesco has gradually started to sell these products. There was a row last year when it emerged Tesco was stocking American Lucky Charms cereal, which is made from GM corn – a fact buried in small print on the package – and contains artificial colours that the Food Standards Agency has linked to hyperactivity in young children. But a free trade treaty that is being negotiated between the EU and the US is set to further open the door to American GM foods. Dr Helen Wallace, of the research group GeneWatch, said the growing of GM soya and maize used in the teriyaki sauce sold by M&S has had a devastating impact on butterflies. She said: ‘By importing this product, M&S is contributing to the devastating crash in Monarch butterfly populations. Weedkiller on GM soya and maize has destroyed vast swathes of the habitat. Customers are likely to be shocked by this cavalier disregard for the environment.’ Liz O’Neill, of campaigners GM Freeze, added: ‘People expect to be able to trust their favourite retailers, who wouldn’t put these ingredients in their own brand products.’ M&S said: ‘This is a very small number of products. They are clearly not M&S-branded products and are clearly labelled. ‘This in no way affects our commitment to only using non-GM food ingredients in M&S food.’ A Tesco spokesman said: ‘Our American range is very popular. All products are clearly labelled in line with relevant legislation.’ Health and consumer groups have slammed attempts by the EU and the food industry to kill off ‘traffic light’ labels adopted in Britain to help tackle obesity. The labels help shoppers identify foods high in sugar, fat and salt. The European Commission is threatening to take Britain to court unless the scheme is scrapped, after Brussels bureaucrats appear to have given in to the foreign food industry. They claim the UK labels create a barrier to foreign food firms and amount to an illegal restraint of trade. Cardiologist Dr Aseem Malhotra, of Action On Sugar, said the EU move was ‘scandalous’.","Store does not use genetically-modified ingredients in own-label products .

"Lionel Messi was the surprise omission as the three-man shortlist for the LFP's 'Best Striker of the 2013/2014' award was revealed on Friday. Despite missing over two months of last season with a hamstring problem, the 27-year-old scored an impressive 36 goals in all competitions for the Catalan giants, but that wasn't enough for him to be recognised on this occasion. Instead, reigning Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, former Atletico Madrid striker Diego Costa and Real Sociedad starlet Carlos Vela were nominated for the award. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch... The front page of AS reveals that Cristano Ronaldo, Diego Costa and Carlos Vela have made the three-man shortlist for the best striker award from last season's La Liga . Costa, Ronaldo and Vela were all in impressive form for their respective sides last season . Ronaldo celebrates scoring against Celta Vigo at the Bernabeu in January . Cristiano Ronaldo: 1.03 goals/games average . Diego Costa : .77 goals/games average . Carlos Vela: .43 goals/games average . All three were the leading marksman for their respective sides last season, with Costa in particular playing a huge role in his sides' success as they pipped Barcelona to the La Liga title. Costa, who joined Chelsea for £32million earlier this summer, scored 27 goals in 35 games as Atletico won La Liga for the first time in 18 years. Elsewhere, there were no real surprises with Ronaldo's inclusion, as the golden boot winner notched 48 goals in all competitions for Real Madrid last season - the fourth year in a row the Portuguese star has scored over 30 goals in a season. Costa celebrates his goal during Atletico's Champions League semi-final against Chelsea last season . Messi points to the sky in celebration as Ronaldo looks on deflated during an El Clasico meeting . Vela looks to get ahead of Jordi Figueras during Real Sociedad's clash with Real Betis in April . Despite not scoring as many goals as his other two competitors for the award, nor Messi, Vela played a pivotal role in keeping his side in European contention, scoring 16 goals in 37 matches for Sociedad. The 25-year-old has impressed during his stint in Spain after failing to make an impact in England with Arsenal, recording his single-season high goal haul last season. The winner will be announced at the awards ceremony on October 27.","Lionel Messi was a notable absence from the three-man shortlist .

"At least five off-duty New York Police Department officers have admitted being present at the savage revenge beating last weekend on the Henry Hudson Parkway, according to reports. Among the off duty cops were at least two detectives and three other officers, all who witnessed the attack and did little to stop it. One of the detectives, an undercover narcotics officer, watched as the violence broke out and chose not to break it up for fear of ruining his cover. The five officers were not the only ones present, WABC is reporting that the NYPD is investigating whether several off-duty corrections officers were also there. Police who saw the violent attack did not begin coming forward until Wednesday - four days later. Before and after: Edwin Mieses Jr suffered a broken spine, fractured ribs, a punctured lung and a torn aortic valve and now may never walk again . It is believed that the 38-year-old biker who was . seen on the video smashing his helmet into the Range Rover's window is . expected to turn himself in to police for his role in the melee, according to WABC. It is not clear what further role, if any, he played in the fracas. Investigators have already questioned some of the six individuals seen in the YouTube video of the assault, according to WABC. They plan to talk to as many as possible, the station noted. 'This is a complex investigation with a lot of people involved,' a source told WABC. One of the bikers who spoke to investigators said that Mr Lien 'drove erratically and bumped the bike on the side,' adding 'when he bumped that bike on the side, that bike became aggressive because his life was in danger,' according to WABC. The New York Post originally reported that the first undercover officer to admit being at the ruthless pounding was not the only cop at the scene, as several members of the motorcycle group- called the Front Line Soldiers- are police officers themselves. Internal Affairs of the NYPD are now investigating whether or not any of these officers were the ones who were pictured hitting the Range Rover, though they do not seem to be worried that the undercover took part . When reached by MailOnline for comment, an NYPD spokesperson said only that the involvement of off-duty officers 'is under investigation.' 'It is does not appear that he got involved at the scene,' a police source told The Post. That said, the undercover officer has hired a lawyer. On camera: This shows the moment the Range Rover driver panicked and hit some of the bikers as he tried to get away to protect his wife and child. It is believed he hit Jeremiah Mieses here . When they come to a standstill in heavy traffic, it takes moments before a biker jumps off and attacks the vehicle, smashing the driver's window with his helmet . He was not the only one to do so, as longtime partner of Edwin Mieses Jr, the man who was run over by the car, has hired famed defender Gloria Allred. 'He is the best father I know,' Dayana Mejia said at a Friday press conference. 'To learn that he almost died and that he may not walk again- that is all still sinking in. 'It tears me up that anyone could think that Edwin in anyway deserves what happened to him.' Mieses was one of dozens of bikers who rode alongside a black Range Rover on Manhattan's West Side Highway last weekend until a biker slowed down and the vehicles bumped, police said. Video captured at the scene shows the SUV surrounded by helmeted riders. The broken window on the passenger side of the vehicle shows that the male driver was not the only target . Scary: The Liens said they feared for their lives . Towed away: The car was brought to the NYPD's 33 precinct on Friday . In the video, one rider approaches the vehicle and peers into the driver's side window. Police said others tried to damage the SUV before the driver, Alexian Lien, took off and ploughed over Mieses. The . bikers then chased after Lien and smashed his car window with their . helmets, then pulled him from the SUV and beat him to the point where he . required stitches. Lien's wife, Rosalyn Ng, has said that . her family's sympathies go out to Mieses, but that they had to flee a . dangerous situation. 'He is the best father I know,' Dayana Mejia, Mieses' longtime partner, said at a Friday press conference . Support: Ms Mejia, seen with attorney Gloria Allred and Mieses' father Edwin Mieses Sr, said that they are still coping with how to deal with Edwin's injuries . She said her husband was trying to protect her and their 2-year-old child, who was also in the car at the time. Mieses, . who is from Lawrence, Massachusetts, suffered a broken spine, fractured . ribs, a punctured lung and a torn aortic valve, said his attorney, . Allred. His injuries may have left him paralyzed. Pain: Ms Mejia said that it is wrong to cast any of the blame of the incident on her partner . 'He told everyone to move on and go back to riding, and turned his back to the SUV to start walking back to his own bike,' Allred said. 'It was then, with his back to the SUV, and as he was in front of it, that he was run over and crushed.' Mejia said a difficult situation has been made worse by what she described as a 'perception' that some people have about the riders who participated in the rally on Sunday. 'They are not gang members. They are not thugs,' Mejia said. 'They are FedEx drivers, plumbers, military reservists, musicians. They are fathers and brothers and sons, and sisters and mothers.' She also said Mieses didn't know any of the people he was riding with on Sunday aside from one friend who traveled to New York with him. Mieses was recently arrested in Andover, Mass., for driving with a revoked license. He also never applied for a motorcycle license. Records show that in June he was named a habitual offender and his right to drive in the state was revoked until 2017. It wasn't clear if he had been licensed in any other state. Badly injured: Lien needed stitches after he was attacked by bikers in New York. He hit some bikers in a bid to escape them but they caught up and beat him . Mieses and the others seen on the video were participating in a periodic rally in which more than 1,000 bikers head for Times Square, police said. The Manhattan district attorney's office has charged one rider, 28-year-old Christopher Cruz, of Passaic, N.J., with unlawful imprisonment and reckless driving while authorities continue to search for other cyclists. Investigators and prosecutors are tracking down and talking to dozens of helmet-clad motorcyclists seen in the video, which was posted online.","Injured biker Edwin Mieses Jr now faces permanent paralysis .

"Famous boxer Anthony Mundine, a close friend of Phillip Hughes, has broken his silence following the cricketer's tragic death on Thursday. The pair were good friends, and Hughes attended a number of the boxer's matches to support Mundine from the side of the ring.

"A San Francisco man who almost took his life eight years ago by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge has been reunited with the hero who saved his life. Kevin Berthia was perched on the iconic bridge ready to take a fatal leap on March 11, 2005, when he heard the voice of California Highway Patrol officer Kevin Briggs calling out to him from above. Over 60 life-changing minutes, Briggs managed to convince Berthia, as he has done with hundreds of suicidal men and women, to climb back over the rail and give life another shot. Since that significant day Berthia hasn't looked back and is now happily married with two children. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Reunited: Kevin Briggs, (center) shakes the hand of Kevin Berthia (left), the officer who talked him down from throwing himself off San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge in 2005 . Savior: Kevin Berthia, right, was perched on the iconic bridge ready to take a fatal leap on March 11, 2005, when California Highway Patrol officer Kevin Briggs, left, talked him off the ledge and back to safety . And this week he was able to thank the man who made all that possible. The pair reunited as part of an emotional ceremony honoring Briggs and other members of the CHP known as the Guardians of the Golden Gate Bridge, whose job it is to gently talk people like Berthia down from the structure. 'It was phenomenal,' Berthia, 30, told Yahoo News about the reunion at the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention public service ceremony. 'I didn't know what I was going to feel, or how I was going to react,' he said. 'But when I first saw him, he walked up me and I just shook his hand. It felt like I had known this man my whole life. The nerves weren't there. It was just two old friends being reunited.' As he presented Briggs with the award, Bertha explained how grateful he was for Briggs' help and urged others to seek help, insisting they could too get better and life a fulfilled life. 'I didn't want him to try and stop me but now I'm glad he did,' he told the crowd. 'All I can say is that I am truly grateful. You gave me an opportunity to live.' Saving lives: During his 20 years patrolling the bridge Briggs has managed to talk may despondent people out of taking the fatal fall . The pair were reconnected after a Yahoo documentary in December 2012 chronicled the work of Briggs' team, centering on Berthia's case. A resounding image of the man clinging to the bridge as Briggs spoke to him provoked an outpouring of support from the Bay area community. After he received the award, Briggs said he was 'very humbled, honored and happy' to have the recognition for his team's hard work. 'I (accept this award) on behalf of the California Highway Patrol and police officers across this country who strive to do their best each and every time they receive a suicide call. 'During my career I've encountered numerous suicide attempts on the Golden Gate Bridge. Of those attempts, I've only lost one person. It's something you never forget. 'Kevin found the courage in himself that day to climb back over the rail, thus beginning a new stage in his life. Here, standing before us, is the reason we do what we do.' Reunited: Berthia and Briggs, pictured, were reconnected this month after a Yahoo documentary in December 2012 chronicled the work of Briggs' team, centering on Berthia's case . Briggs said, since Yahoo's video, he had been contacted to get his life rights for a movie and other police departments have called to speak to him about the CHP's work. 'It's all been very humbling, to be honest,' he said. Briggs, a cancer survivor and army veteran, first met with Berthia's mother and then the two men and their families met privately in a small room before the ceremony began. 'I wanted to meet him again,' Briggs told Yahoo, acknowledging that it was 'very unusual' for him to have contact with any of the men and women whose lives he's saved over the years. 'I just said, ""It's great to see you."" He said, ""My Mom is your No. 1 fan."" It was really neat.'Berthia said the bond the pair forged during those 60 significant minutes will see them being friends for life. 'Now that I have his number, I don't see us never not being friends,' he told Yahoo. 'We are of such a different age but it never feels like that. I've shared things with Officer Briggs in those 60 minutes that no one else in the world knows. It's a special bond there.'","Kevin Berthia was perched on the iconic bridge ready to take a fatal leap on March 11, 2005 .

"Britain’s floods crisis could get worse before it gets better, David Cameron warned today as he urged the whole country to ‘pull together’. The Prime Minister dramatically cancelled a planned visit to Israel next week to remain in charge of the government’s response to more storms forecast in the next few days. Vowing that ‘money is no object’ in the relief effort, he promised new help to homeowners, businesses and farmers 'to piece their lives back together again'. It came as Royal Bank of Scotland became the first lender to offer a three-month mortgage 'holiday' to homeowners facing huge repair bills after being flooded. David Cameron, pictured with resident Ray Connerlley on a flooded Guildford Street in Staines-upon-Thames, warned things could get worse before they get better . The Prime Minister insisted that the armed forces would remain on standby to deal with future emergencies caused by forecast storms . More than 1,500 members of Britain's armed forces have been put on standby to help communities wrecked by flooding, with 1,000 people forced to leave their homes in the South West and Thames Valley. With 16 severe flood warnings, 133 flood warnings and 225 flood alerts still in force, with 1.5in of rain expected by Friday night. In a rare press conference in Downing Street, Mr Cameron said: ‘""There is absolutely no sign of this threat abating, and with further rain and strong winds forecast throughout the week, things may get worse before they get better.' More than 80,000 people have signed the Mail's petition to the Prime Minister calling for him to 'divert some of the £11billion a year spent on overseas aid to ease the suffering of British flood victims, and to build and maintain flood defences to prevent a repetition of this crisis'. Flooded homeowners and businesses will be offered grants to build new flood defences, with companies also able to defer paying tax bills. Dunkirk spirit: Volunteers help to fill and stack sandbags to help bolster flood defences at Burrowbridge in Somerset . There are 16 severe flood warnings, 133 flood warnings and 225 flood alerts still in force, with 1.5in of rain expected by Friday night .

David Cameron pledged a major package of help for people affected by floods as he urged the country to 'pull together'. It included: . HOMEOWNERS . Grants worth several thousand pounds to build in better flood protection as they repair their properties . Insurance companies told to 'pay up the money fast' BUSINESSES . A tax deferral scheme for businesses affected by the floods to give them longer to pay their taxes . Grants to help them improve flood defences . FARMERS . Up to £10 milliion to help them recover from the devastation to their livelihoods . But Mr Cameron insisted: ‘Money is no object in this relief effort. Where money is needed it will be spent. We will take whatever steps necessary.’ He vowed to continue to lead the national response by chairing meetings of the government’s emergency committee Cobra. ‘I am cancelling my visit to the Middle East next week,’ he added, after aides feared he would look like he had abandoned British families to fly abroad. Mr Cameron revealed the military will play a bigger role, and by tonight there will be 1,600 servicemen and women deployed with ‘thousands more now available’. Major General Patrick Sanders, Assistant Chief of the Defence Staff, is now co-ordinating the military effort. The forces will work with the emergency services’ gold and silver commanders to ‘provide assistance and assurance to members of the public including by reinforcing sandbags and flood defences, getting medical assistance to the sick and inform and checking on a helping any other vulnerable people’, Mr Cameron added. ‘I urge everyone in those affected areas to keep listening to the warnings and to work with the emergency services, the military and who is working to keep people safe.’ A new Cabinet committee dealing with the clear-up will meet for the first time on Thursday, chaired by Mr Cameron. His warning came as the Environment Agency (EA) said rises in the level of the River Thames were set to cause more disruption for flood-hit areas. Around 1,000 properties have been reported as flooded in the past week, including 800 along the Thames. Environment Agency senior flood adviser Kate Marks warned it was 'increasingly likely' that there would also be problems along the River Severn and River Wye. The . Prime Minister stressed that the focus must be on the flood defences, . repairs and maintenance needed now, but there will be a time for lessons . to be learned about mistakes made. He repeatedly refused to be drawn on the future of under-fire Environment Agency chairman Lord Smith.

Royal Bank of Scotland is offering three-month mortgage repayment holidays to customers with flooded homes. The group, which includes NatWest, said it would unveil full details of the scheme tomorrow together with contact numbers for customers to get in touch. It said it would also send specialist business support teams to affected areas in coming weeks to help small businesses with short-term financial problems as they carry out repairs and suffer lost trading income. The group, which is 80 per cent owned by the taxpayer, said the moves were in addition to a £250 million RBS/NatWest UK Storm Business Fund announced last month. Mr Cameron added: ‘There are lessons . to be learned from this experience and those lessons will be learned. Right now my focus is on the response. ‘It will be a long haul and it will require a stepped up national effort with the whole country pulling together. A major package of help will be announced this week for homeowners, business and farmers. Insurance . companies will be told to ‘get out there’ so people can make claims to . repair and redecorate homes devastated by flood waters. Businesses hit by storms and floods will be able to defer paying tax bills while they get back on their feet. Residential and business areas will also be offered more help to secure and improve flood defences. And a £10million fund will be created for farmers to recover from the floods. But today there were warnings that small . businesses at risk of flooding could face 'exorbitant' insurance costs . unless a Government-backed scheme is extended to cover them. Labour leader Ed Miliband, who found himself out of his depth during a visit to floods in Wraysbury, called for the government to ensure homes get early payouts from insurance firms . Conservative peer Lord Moynihan said under the current system - a statement of principles agreed between the Government and insurers - businesses employing up to 49 people were covered. He said the proposed new scheme contained in the Water Bill, which is currently going through Parliament, only covered households and 'micro businesses'. It came after Labour leader Ed Miliband urged the Government to put pressure on insurance companies so that victims of the floods do not have to wait for payouts. Mr Miliband said ministers had to act to ensure there was no repeat of the 'foot-dragging' that firms engaged in after the riots in 2011. He said: 'Thousands of families have already been forced to abandon their homes and are now living with friends or family. 'They rightly want to know that this difficult experience isn't going to be compounded by months or years of delay in receiving the insurance pay-outs that will enable a home to be made habitable as soon as possible.'","Prime Minister cancels visit to Israel next week to remain in charge .

"West Brom head coach Alan Irvine has warned potential suitors Saido Berahino is worth more than £15million. The red-hot striker is the top scoring Englishman in the Barclays Premier League with five goals and helped fire England Under 21s to Euro 2015 this month. Tottenham had been linked with a £15million move but Irvine dismissed the amount - insisting Berahino would cost much more in today's market. West Brom striker Saido Berahino helped fire England Under 21s to Euro 2015 this month . 'It doesn't sound a lot. I would be absolutely astonished if anyone could sign Saido from us for £15million,' he said. 'You look at some of the fees going around in the transfer market that's just been, everybody seems to start at £7million. 'Ross McCormack went for £11million Championship to Championship. What the right figure is I have absolutely no idea and I wouldn't make the decision as far as that was concerned. 'But £15million doesn't sound like a lot of money for a talented, young, English player with great potential who is playing really, really well in the Premier League at the moment and who is scoring goals. It would have to be higher than that. Saido Berahino scores penalty for England  during Under 21 playoff match against Croatia . 'It was a seller's market in this particular transfer window. We know as we kept going to try to buy people and we realised how difficult that was.' Irvine would not welcome any offers but believes Berahino can handle any speculation and it will not harm his performances. 'I have had a few conversations with him where it's been a case of 'You keep doing what you are doing and everything will happen for you',' he said, ahead of Monday's visit of Manchester United. 'But he is going to have to deal with that speculation. I don't think there are any alarm bells ringing for me at this particular time and if I saw a change in behaviour or anything like that I would probably have a little word with him.' Saido Berahino is the top scoring Englishman in the Barclays Premier League with five goals this season . But Irvine admitted, should the 21-year-old continue his fine form, interest and bids are inevitable. 'That's something which could happen, there's no question about that but I don't want him to play poorly so that they don't come,' he said. 'I am desperate for him to play really well and if that means other clubs come and start knocking on the door then the club will make a decision on whether these clubs are making the right kind of offers or not.

Silvestre Varela (groin) and Claudio Yacob (personal reasons) will not feature against Louis Van Gaal's side at The Hawthorns on Monday, but Irvine has been boosted by Brunt's progress. He said: 'Chris Brunt was the only man who came back and he came back early. Fortunately for us that's given us time to work with him and he hasn't trained with us yet but he will join in on Saturday. 'I'm expecting everyone who came back to be in contention for the game on Monday.'

"Ilkay Gundogan returned to action for Borussia Dortmund's, but couldn't prevent his side from slipping to a 2-1 defeat at Cologne. It was the midfielder 's first appearance for 17 months following a back injury but goals from Kevin Vogt and Simon Zoller either side of a Ciro Immobile equaliser helped pile on a fifth defeat in eight league matches for Jurgen Klopp's side. Dortmund keeper Roman Weidenfeller gifted their opponents the winner with a failed clearance in the 74th minute that allowed  Zoller to score, after the visitors had equalised through Immobile early in the second half at the RheinEnergieStadion.

"Cocaine death: Shruti Baral,  originally from Hong Kong, had not been in the habit of taking drugs . A mother who supplied a Class A drug used by a student to commit suicide has avoided jail. Francesca Davies, 22, of Maidstone, Kent, gave Shruti Baral an amount of cocaine the day before she was found dead in her bedroom by her teenage brother. Miss Baral, also 22, who was originally from Hong Kong, had not been in the habit of taking drugs, an earlier inquest heard. Davies admitted being concerned in supplying the cocaine. Police officers went with a warrant for her at other addresses in the town but she made contact in June. The Hilton hotel worker had obtained the drug for Miss Baral from a boyfriend, who was a drug dealer, Maidstone Crown Court was told. Judge David Griffith-Jones QC stressed there was no suggestion Davies knew of Miss Baral’s plan to kill herself in February last year. He said: ‘I don’t treat Miss Baral’s sad demise as an aggravating feature. You are a young woman of previous good character. ‘I am satisfied it is appropriate to regard this as something of an aberration - something that was quite out of character for you. I accept your remorse is genuine and there is a low risk of re-offending. 'While I take the view a prison sentence is demanded given the seriousness of the offence, mitigation and the effect your immediate incarceration would have on your very young child lead me to say it can be properly suspended.’ Education: Miss Baral, who died last year, was a former pupil of Invicta Grammar School in Maidstone, Kent . Giving Davies an 18-month prison term suspended for two years with 200 hours of unpaid work, the judge added: ‘You have escaped immediate imprisonment today, but you are not out of the woods. ‘I very much hope you do not let me down and find yourself back here for breaching requirements.’ At Miss Baral’s inquest in August 2013, coroner Patricia Harding recorded a verdict of suicide. Miss Baral was a former pupil at Invicta Grammar School in Maidstone.","Francesca Davies, 22, of Maidstone, Kent, gave Shruti Baral cocaine .

The incredible skill of this painting is also evident when you zoom in, the tears on the Virgin Mary’s face look like water on the canvas. Meanwhile, 'Judith at the Banquet of Holofernes' had at one time been thought to picture Artemisia, Queen of Pergamon, about to drink the ashes of her dead husband. However, the infrared view reveals that there was originally another figure in the painting, waiting with a sack to for the enemy general’s head, identifying the main figure as Judith. The museum created giga-pixel images of the paintings five years ago including the Garden of Earthly Delights by Bosch and Self-Portrait by Dürer. To do this they combined thousands of high-resolution images to create one giant image of 1,000,000,000 or more pixels. This means the user can see the image in unprecedented detail. The app lets users zoom in and out to read the explanations of the key symbolic details of each painting. As well as exploring the works of art, users can interact with them, choosing their favourite detail to share with friends online. Gabriele Finaldi, deputy director of the museum, believes it provides a new level of understanding of the artwork, but that the app is not intended to replace looking at the original. ‘What we're presenting with this app is the opportunity to get right up close, taking you by the hand to show you details you might never notice,’ he said. ‘Visitors in the gallery can spend a minute, even just half a minute, looking at a picture. With the app you can explore every centimetre of the work of art in your own time on your iPad, leading to a deeper understanding of how it was created and every detail the artist included.’ Madpixel, the developers behind the app, hope to work with further galleries and museums to roll the technology out globally.

"Some people like to have a few close friends on Facebook, while others have hundreds who they barely know. Researchers now believe that the number of friends you have can depend on how successful you are, and even how often you move. Researchers from the University of Virginia and the London Business school say the 'perfect' number of friends actually depends on several socioeconomic factors, and varies from country to country. Researchers believe that the number of Facebook friends you have can reveal you social status, and how often you move home . Oishi and Kesebir predicted that a . broad, shallow networking strategy would be optimal for people living in . a residentially mobile, economically favorable context. A narrow, deep networking strategy, . on the other hand, would be optimal if people tend to stay in one place . and economic conditions aren’t as favorable. Shigehiro Oishi, a psychology professor in the University of Virginia’s College of Arts & Sciences, and Selin Kesebir of the London Business School explored the benefits of social networking strategies in two studies currently published in the journal Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science. 'In the age of Facebook, many Americans seem to opt for a broad, shallow networking strategy,' they say. 'Yet cross-cultural research has shown that having many friends is not always viewed positively outside the United States.' One reason that Americans may prefer a large social network, the researchers claim, is because Americans move around a lot. Another important factor may be the economic conditions at a given time. 'When times are prosperous, your friends are less likely to need much help, whether it’s covering a hospital bill or providing babysitting, and so a broad network of friends is easy to maintain,' they claim. 'But when times aren’t as flush, having more friends might incur huge costs in terms of both time and resources.' Oishi and Kesebir predicted that a broad, shallow networking strategy would be optimal for people living in a residentially mobile, economically favorable context. A narrow, deep networking strategy, on the other hand, would be optimal if people tend to stay in one place and economic conditions aren’t as favorable. In the first study, they created a model that simulated the benefits individuals receive from their social network under various socioeconomic conditions. The researchers were able to simulate people who have different numbers of friends at different levels of friendship, and they were also able to account for the investment required by each type of friendship. The team say the 'perfect' number of friends of Facebook depends of several socioeconomic factors - with those who move around a lot likely to have more friends . As they predicted, they found that having a small social network with deep ties to friends is advantageous when friends are not likely to move away and the economy is unstable. Regardless of economic conditions, having a broad social network with weak ties to friends is advantageous when friends are likely to move away. Oishi and Kesebir conducted a second study to investigate whether this pattern of results would hold up in the real world. They recruited 247 Americans to participate in an online survey through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. The survey was designed to parallel the computer simulation from the first study. The participants were asked to list three different kinds of friends: very close, close and distant. In order to get a sense of the participants’ social networking strategy, the researchers asked them to imagine that their time, energy and money were limited to 60 points and to distribute the points among their three types of friends. The researchers say social networking strategies can reveal more than expected about people . They also assessed participants’ subjective well-being through a combination of three measures: life satisfaction, experiences of positive emotions and lack of experiences of negative emotions. Finally, the researchers used census data to obtain information about residential mobility and median family income in each postcode. The findings from the second study echoed those of the first study. In postcodes in which residents were stable and had relatively low incomes, participants who had a narrow, deep friendship strategy reported greater well-being than those who had a broad, shallow friendship strategy. Notably, the broad, shallow strategy was associated with subjective well-being in all three of the other economic conditions (low income-unstable, high income-stable, high income-unstable). Oishi and Kesebir argue that these two studies provide clear evidence for the role of socioeconomic factors – such as residential mobility and economic security – in determining the most adaptive networking strategy. 'As residential mobility decreases and economic recession deepens in the United States, the optimal social-networking strategy might shift from the broad-but-shallow to the narrow-but-deep, even in a nation known best for the strength of weak ties,' the researchers conclude.","Researchers say the 'perfect' number of friends varies between countries .
Claim factors including the availability of friends for babysitting or even money lending can impact the number of Facebook friends a person has ."
"Cristiano Ronaldo is scoring goals at a ratio of more than two-a-game as he goes into this week's Champions League match with Liverpool at Anfield. After a brace in a comfortable 5-0 away win against Levante he moved to 15 goals in seven league games – it's a record start to the season in the Spanish league and it gives him a better scoring average than most teams in Europe. He will score over 70 this season if he continues at his current rate. Real Madrid made light work of Levante. Livepool will be a far tougher test but Carlo Ancelotti's team are starting to resemble the side that won last season's European Cup. Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates scoring first goal against Levante on Saturday afternoon . Real Madrid: Casillas, Carvajal, Pepe, Nacho, Marcelo (Arbeloa 73), Rodríguez, Modric (Medran 79), Kroos (Illarramendi 68), Isco, Hernandez, Ronaldo . Subs not used: Khedira, Bale, Navas, Arbeloa, Illarramendi, Medran, Llorente . Goals: Ronaldo 13 (pen), 61, Hernandez 38, Rodríguez 66, Isco 82 . Ref: Ignacio Iglesias Villanueva . Att: 23,506 . Real Madrid were without an under-the-weather Karim Benzema and the injured Sergio Ramos. Gareth Bale watched the game from the bench and Luka Modric hobbled off with a bruised foot in the second half. If all four are fit to play against Liverpool the Real Madrid coach's most difficult job will be to decide who to leave out. Levante came into the game not having scored at home yet this season but they have a habit of making life very difficult for Real Madrid and might have fancied their chances against an injury and illness-affected opposition. But Ancelotti had said in the week that naming Ronaldo in his starting XI is worth a goal start for his team and so it proved again. Ronaldo almost scored inside the first two minutes when found with a long ball out of defence from Luka Modric but he shot uncharacteristically wide of the target. Real Madrid's talisman doesn't need three chances to score and with his second opportunity from the spot he shot past Diego Marino to make it 1-0. Cristiano Ronaldo, Javier Hernandez and James Rodriguez were all on the scoresheet against Levante on Saturday . Jaime Gavilan  can't hide his disappointment as of Levante are thrashed at home .

Real Madrid's Ronaldo (L) skips away from Levante defender Hector Rodas during Saturday's La Liga clash . It was not his most convincing penalty but it went through the keeper's hands. The spot-kick award had also been slightly dubious. Hernandez went down in the area under a challenge from Juanfran who protested vehemently that he had got the ball not the man. It was Ronaldo's 14th goal in eight league games – something no-one had done at the start of a season in Spain since Oviedo's Echevarría in the 1943 season. Juanfran was booked for the foul that led to the penalty and so was Victor Camarasa when he up-ended Ronaldo under the referee's nose moments later. Modric forced Marino into a fine save with a vicious shot from the edge of the area and from Madrid's next attack they did double their lead. James Rodriguez crossed from the right and Hernandez headed down and beyond Marino for his third goal of the season. Ruben Garcia (left) of Levante is tackled by Real Madrid defender Marcelo . Ruben Garcia (left) of Levante is tackled by Nacho of Real Madrid during the La Liga match . For all the fire-power lost in midfield due to Bale's absence Madrid had gained in balance with the extra natural midfielder and the Rodriguez, Modric, Toni Kroos, Isco quartet was in complete control of the game for Madrid. The later was particularly outstanding and will feel justifiably hard done by when he is left out for the returning Bale on Wednesday. It was Isco who started the move that led to the third goal scored by Ronaldo, who cut in from the left, ghosting past Juanfran before burying a shot past Marino for his 15th goal of the season. Levante had long since accepted their fate and Kroos was allowed to look up and pick his pass for the spectacular fourth goal scored by Rodriguez, who collected the floated assist on his chest before volleying home. The brilliant Isco rifled in a glorious fifth to mean Madrid have now won their last five league games, scoring 25 goals and conceding only three. 'We are in great form going to Anfield,' said the midfielder. Levante midfielder Victor Camarasa (left) vies with Real Madrid's Croatia midfielder Luka Modric .

"It may sound about as useful as an ashtray on a motorbike or a chocolate fireguard, but one inventor hopes we will soon be riding around on a bike with no pedals. Using the Velofeet is as easy as a walk in the park, as you simply sit back astride its single wheel and stride along. Manuel Alvarez-Icaza, its Inverness-based inventor, believes the wackiest idea since the Segway could provide the solution to congested city centres by providing a lightweight and manoeuvrable way of travelling short distances. Scroll down for video . Unique: Manuel Alvarez-Icaza believes the Velofeet could be the solution to congested cities . Sceptics may scratch their head and wonder what is wrong with the humble bicycle (global sales of one billion and counting) but retired physicist Mr Alvarez-Icaza insists his design is better. He said yesterday: ‘It’s a bit like a unicycle but it is more efficient. It’s simplicity itself and you build up momentum very quickly. ‘You just lean to change direction and to stop you lean back on the seat and the brakes come on. ‘It uses the natural movements of the body to propel it. Its top speed is about a jogging pace, although I’m sure with practice you may be able to go faster. ‘So, it’s a jogging speed with the effort of walking. I can see it being ideal for use in cities and towns. ‘We’ll have a sports version as well and you could use it for games like basketball or even football. It’s more efficient than a unicycle or a bicycle and easier to use.’ Mr Alvarez-Icaza believes his invention is more efficient than a unicycle or a bicycle and easier to use . The 61-year-old father of two was born in Mexico but has spent that past 18 years living in the Highlands, where he helped to set up the medical company LifeScan. He said: ‘The Velofeet is a very exciting project and I will develop it further. It’s a real step forward.’ His original aim was to develop something more practical than a bike for travelling in city centres. Velofeet (left) was designed by Manuel Alvarez-Icaza (right) who admits it might be difficult to use climbing a hill . He said: ‘Travelling by bike has other problems – you are afraid to leave it anywhere in case it is stolen and it takes up a lot of space. 'What I wanted to produce is something that is very simple, very light and is easy to carry around with you.’ He concedes climbing hills may be a problem but says: ‘It would still be worth carrying your Velofeet uphill because you will get the benefit of it going downhill.

"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a watchdog department created in 2011 to create a level financial playing field for American consumers, has scrapped its internal employee performance review process following revelations that nonunion workers and caucasians routinely scored better than unionized employees and minorities in 2013. The annual performance reviews award scores on a scale from 1 to 5 and are closely tied to salary raises, bonuses and career advancement. Instead of keeping the scores in place, agency leaders have decided to award all of their 1,100 employees ratings of '5.' An internal CFPB report released this month found that 'the average ratings for black and Hispanic employees were lower than the average ratings for white and Asian employees.' SCROLL DOWN TO READ THE REPORT . Racial disparities? President Obama chose former Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray (R) to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2012, but he now presides over a bureaucracy that appears to have un-leveled its internal playing field . The average score for white employees last year was 3.94, while the average was 3.81 for Asians, 3.69 for Hispanics and 3.63 for blacks. Unionized employees scored an average of 3.79, while their nonunion counterparts scored 4.04. 'Our performance ratings system did not meet our own objectives and expectations,' the report read in part. 'The analyses we undertook found statistically significant disparities indicating that employees were more likely to receive higher or lower overall performance ratings based on their race, age, pay grade, bargaining unit membership eligibility, tenure or whether they worked within the agency. For these reasons, we have decided to revisit our approach to our performance management program.' In an e-mail to all employees obtained by the American Banker newspaper, CFPB Director Richard Cordray claimed there 'was no single factor that caused this result.' 'We have determined that there were broad-based disparities in the way performance ratings were assigned across our employee base in both 2012 and 2013,' Cordray wrote. 'These differences indicate a systemic disadvantage to various categories of employees.' In order to correct those 'disadvantages,' the agency has 'remediated' the compensation of employees, other than senior managers, who received overall performance scores of 3 or 4 during either of the last two years. Instead of the result of their evaluations, they will be paid as though they had received a grade of 5. 'Everyone’s a winner!' quipped Bankstocks.com writer Thomas Brown. 'Only rather than a trophy, everyone gets cash money. Welcome to cloud-cuckoo land.' 'Hard-working, conscientious workers (and, yes, the federal government does have those) deserve to be treated better and paid more than workers who, say, persistently show up late and turn in shoddy work,' he added. 'Instead, in its pathetic bow to political correctness, the slackers are being rewarded.' Cordray has presided over an agency that an outside investigator said was full of 'exclusion, retaliation, discrimination, nepotism, demoralization, devaluation and other offensive working conditions' Silence: Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren (R) was the agency's first chief, serving as 'special adviser' during its creation -- she has been quiet about her former bureau's problems . The Daily Caller reported that the latest embarrassment for the CFPB comes just one day before its senior managers will deliver subpoenaed testimony to Congress, addressing reports of retaliatory discrimination against some employees. Hearings and subpoenas, however, came in response to complaints from a white attorney employed by the agency who said she experienced that sort of bias. 'Sadly, my story is not unique,' Angela Martin testified in April. 'My colleagues likewise have suffered and are suffering at the hands of inexperienced, unaccountable manager.' The Washington Post first reported that Martin was black, but later corrected its story online. Misty Raucci, a former investigator for an outside firm the CFPB hired to probe Martin's complaint, testified before a House Financial Services subcommittee  on April 2 that she found a work environment there rife with 'exclusion, retaliation, discrimination, nepotism, demoralization, devaluation and other offensive working conditions.'","Consumer Financial Protection Bureau staff ratings showed racial disparities and other unequal results .

"A three-storey 28-bedroom country manor has been bought for just £600,000 - because it is too big. Stunning Moreton House is a Grade II-listed 'gentleman's residence' near Bideford, Devon, which is spread over a staggering 34,250 sq ft. This makes it around 35 times the size of the average UK home and more than half the size of a football pitch. Bought for £600,000: Moreton House is a 28-bedroom 'gentleman's residence' in Devon, which was completed in 1821 - 60 years after work commenced . Set in five acres, it has a wealth of period features and boasts 28 bedrooms, 19 reception rooms, an impressive ballroom and eight bathrooms. It was put on the market with a guide price of in excess of £500,000. The mansion was given the eye-catching price-tag because it is simply too big. There was international interest and offers of as little as £200,000 were made for the mansion from people wanting to turn it into a hotel, a wedding venue and even an academy for builders. Moreton House: This property boasts a wealth of period features and elegantly proportioned rooms spread over 32,000 sq ft . Beautiful interior: The stamp duty bill from a £7.1 million purchase would be enough to buy the mansion . But a price thought to be 'in excess of £600,000' has been agreed and the deal went through on Friday. This is half the price of a one-bedroom flat in Mayfair and a around quarter of the price of a row of parking spaces which have just gone on sale in prime central London. It is the same price car dealer John Collins paid for a pair of registration plates for his Ferraris last week. Staircase and garden: Work on the mansion is thought to have been started in 1760 and it was completed in 1821 . James Gibbs, land and new home director at Jackson-Stops & Staff, managed the sale. He said: 'We had all sorts of people showing interest in Moreton House, with calls coming from Australia, Abu Dhabi, India. 'Some wanted to convert it into a hotel, others as a wedding venue and there was interest in it being used as a residential home. 'I believe the buyer will be using it as a family home and they have got a great deal. It is fitting it went through on Black Friday. Alternative view: The property, near Bideford, north Devon, is half the price of a one-bedroom flat in Mayfair and a around quarter of the price of a row of parking spaces which have just gone on sale in prime central London . 'We were proven right about the price, but if it was in the Home Counties it would have cost more than ten times as much. 'The buyers have upsized from another large home. Everyone is delighted with the sale.' Work on the mansion started in 1760 and it was completed 60 years later. George Buck, who was the High Sheriff of Devon, lived in the home. Location: Moreton House is located near Bideford in north Devon, west of Barnstaple . Grounds: Set in five acres, it has a wealth of period features and elegantly grand rooms . Enormous: Moreton House, which appears to be in good condition, was given its attractive price because it is 'so big' Over the years it has undergone significant changes and, in 1913, three of the first floor rooms overlooking the gardens were merged to create a ballroom with ornate ceilings and a parquet wood floor. Other period features include ornate ceilings and fireplaces, bay windows and a Jacobean style staircase with carved newels. Mr Gibbs had previously said that if it was a tenth of the size it would probably still be the same price - with the buyer 'basically getting 90 per cent free'.","Moreton House is a Grade II-listed 'gentleman's residence' which is spread over a staggering 34,250 sq ft .

"While most little girls love pink, pink was my least favourite colour growing up because it reminded me of the colour of my face — and still does. For as long as I can remember I have consistently blushed bright pink at the slightest provocation. In fact, to say that I am easily embarrassed is something of an understatement. Even now — as a grown woman of 62 — I only have to get slightly anxious to flush a bright shade of fuchsia. If anyone makes a flattering remark, I blush; if they make an unflattering one, I blush, and if I do something silly, of course, I blush. Scroll down for video . For as long as Linda Kelsey can remember she has consistently blushed bright pink at the slightest provocation. According to a recent study, we embarrass ourselves as many as seven times per week and women feel embarrassed three times more often than men. But seven times per week doesn’t sound that often to me — I blush profusely at least once a day. On Tuesday, I managed to clock up two embarrassing moments before lunch. In the morning I spent five minutes searching for my glasses. ‘I just don’t know where they’ve got to,’ I moaned, only to have my partner point out that not only was I wearing them but I had another pair perched on my head! Cue redness. While most little girls love pink, pink was Linda's least favourite colour growing up because it reminded her of the colour of my face . Then in my local cafe, I bumped into an old flame I hadn’t seen since school. Despite me having unwashed hair and no make-up, he recognised me and announced cheerily: ‘I was hopelessly in love with you when I was 14.’ My hand instantly flew up to cover the pinky-hue I could feel spreading across my cheeks. Most people eventually stop going red when they get older, mainly because their confidence grows and they learn how to deal with embarrassing situations better. For those of us who continue to be afflicted, blushing in itself remains a lifelong embarrassment. According to clinical psychologist Professor Robert Bor, author of Coping Successfully With Shyness, we get embarrassed because of a sense of either actual or impending shame, as well as a fear of unwarranted attention. ‘It kicks off an immediate physical reaction with a heightened state of arousal or adrenaline rush,’ he explains. ‘You’re not in control of this physical response and you may turn red as a result. Other responses can include a dry mouth and racing heart.’ Not everyone who feels embarrassment blushes, but chronic blushers sometimes become so fearful of blushing that they begin to lead a hermit-like existence, avoiding social situations entirely. Although the survey suggests women feel embarrassed three times as often as men, Professor Robert Edelmann, author of Coping With Blushing, thinks it would be wrong to conclude that women suffer embarrassment more than men. ‘Women tend to score higher than men on most levels of anxiety,’ he says. ‘But this could be because women are more willing to admit they have negative feelings and find it easier to talk about their problems than men do.’ Just why some people are more easily embarrassed than others may be partly genetic and partly learned (stock picture) Just why some people are more easily embarrassed than others may be partly genetic and partly learned. ‘If your parents are shy you may inherit that tendency, or perhaps you just pick up on their way of behaving,’ says Professor Bor. Certainly, my own mother was especially timid, while my dad was an outgoing charmer. When I look at old photos of my mother she’s always posing with her head slightly at an angle and eyes slightly away from the direct gaze of the camera, as if mildly embarrassed. Rather like the pose Princess Diana struck in early pictures. An easily embarrassed child, it seems, can turn even a positive situation into a negative. Professor Bor gives the example of a bright student who knows the answer to a question asked by a teacher in class but won’t put up his or her hand because then everyone else will look at them. A blush doesn’t just show on your face — your stomach lining also turns red . That’s exactly why I kept schtum throughout my childhood and hated being picked out for special attention. I was worried I would get teased for being the clever one. In the same way, an easily embarrassed adult might be enjoying their birthday party only to feel horribly exposed when everyone sings Happy Birthday. I enjoy celebrating my birthday but singing and speeches are strictly forbidden. Not everyone who is shy needs professional help, but if embarrassment is inhibiting you from getting on with your life —from forming relationships, progressing in your career or simply from going out and having fun — help is available. According to Professor Bor, modern psychological methods for dealing with social anxiety and embarrassment offer some of the most successful and rapid treatments of all. Linda often uses a green-tinged face cream under foundation to counteract redness, but would only consider surgery if blushing was preventing her from getting on with her life . A few sessions of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), a therapy based on the idea that unhelpful and unrealistic thinking leads to negative behaviour, can give a big confidence boost — and blushing the boot. There’s also hope in the form of an operation, endoscopic transthoracic sympathectomy, which destroys the nerve responsible for facial blushing. Some 200 operations to cure blushing are done every year on the NHS, with a 90 per cent success rate. But one of the main risks is compensatory excess sweating, which can be as difficult to deal with as the initial problem. Some 200 operations to cure blushing are done every year on the NHS (stock picture) So how do you overcome your propensity to turn pink if you don’t want to resort to surgery? While I often use a green-tinged face cream under foundation to counteract redness, I’d only consider surgery if blushing was preventing me from getting on with my life. Professor Bor says the secret is to force yourself to cope in embarrassing situations and that’s how I’ve managed to get by. So I accept invitations to public-speaking engagements and am interviewed on radio and TV — even though I really don’t want to. For those of us who despair of our constant blushing, there is some comfort to be gained from recent research that proves embarrassment can be a good thing. Studies from the University of California, Berkeley, have shown that people who display embarrassment when describing embarrassing moments are regarded as more co-operative and trustworthy than those who show pride. Professor Edelmann says: ‘Blushing shows you have a degree of humility, and that can be attractive. That perhaps explains why no woman’s make-up is ever complete without a dab of blusher to give her a slight pink glow.’ I’ve lived with my blushing for so long now that I’ve almost come to accept it. I know that when my partner grabs me for a kiss in the park, I will blush and pull away, even though I’m thrilled. That when I am about to introduce someone and have forgotten their name — which happens all the time — I will blush like an awkward teenager. And that when I walk through the Nothing To Declare corridor in customs, I will blush, even though I really do have nothing to declare. Other than my blushing that is . . .","Some 200 operations to cure blushing are done every year on the NHS .

"Paul Woodland, 32, drowned during a Special Boat Service exercise off Saunton Sands, North Devon, in October 2012 . A Royal Marine drowned in a ‘freak accident’ during a Special Forces training exercise after he became trapped under a boat when it was capsized by a large wave. Paul Woodland, 32, was thrown out of the 15 foot long twin engine rigid inflatable boat (RIB) after both engines failed and it was overturned by a ‘six-foot’ wave. He became trapped underneath the boat after his dry suit apparently became snagged on one of the failed engines. His four comrades quickly realised he was in trouble and within around 90 seconds they dragged him clear but he was unconscious. The fatal incident occurred during a Special Boat Service exercise off Saunton Sands, North Devon, in October 2012. Mr Woodland, from Cardiff, Wales, was flown to North Devon District Hospital in Barnstaple after he was pulled from the water but he was pronounced dead a few minutes after his arrival. The Marine, based at Poole, Dorset, was taking part in a five-week course in which he was training to be in the Special Boat Service. If successful on the course, Marines can be selected for the elite Special Forces unit of the Naval Service. Details of Mr Woodland’s tragic death only emerged yesterday when four of his commando comrades gave evidence at an inquest. The Marines, who appeared behind screens at the inquest in Barnstaple, North Devon, were identified only as Soldiers B, C, D and F. The Greater Devon coroner Dr Elizabeth Earland said their anonymity was 'in deference to requirements of national security'. The men gave graphic accounts of the incident which was heard by Mr Woodland’s family and fiancé who attended the inquest. They told how both engines on the RIB became flooded and inoperable by large breaking waves during the exercise. Royal Marine Paul Woodland, left, was planning to marry his girlfriend Sian, right, before the tragic accident off Saunton Sands, North Devon, in October 2012 . Royal Marine Paul Woodland, from Cardiff, Wales, became trapped underneath the capsized boat after his dry suit apparently became snagged on one of the failed engines during the exercise in 2012 . Solider C, the helmsman, said he had not come across engines jamming before but both he and Soldier B tried ten times to re-start them - but they were unable to and the RIB lost its steering and was hit by the waves. Soldier C said the waves were 'four to five feet high' and a large wave hit them, capsizing the inflatable boat and flipping out all five of the crew. He said being under the water 'felt like being in a washing machine' before he popped back up to the surface. He said they were 50-75 metres from the shore and the crew shouted out their number and said 'okay' but there was a pause when they reached number five who was Mr Woodland. He said: ‘We were a man down. Soldier B shouted that he was trapped under the boat.’ Soldier B . told the inquest he saw Mr Woodland's leg sticking out from the sea and . was 'kicking' out at the rear of the boat by the engines. He said Mr Woodland was in the water for about '30 seconds' when he grabbed his leg and arm and tried to pull him out. He . felt Mr Woodland had become snagged saying: ‘I could not see but I . formed the opinion he became snagged between the engines and something . on his dry suit.’ The fatal incident occurred during a Special Boat Service exercise off Saunton Sands, North Devon, in October 2012 when the engines of the rigid inflateable boat failed and the boat capsized in a large wave (file picture) The fatal incident occurred during a Special Boat Service exercise off Saunton Sands, North Devon, in October 2012 . He said he 'pulled as hard as I could', while another crewman helped to free him. Soldier B said: ‘I could see Paul's face was blue.’ They fired safety flares which alerted safety jet skis to the scene after realising Mr Woodland was trapped. He was pulled to shore and taken in a military ambulance to the top of the beach where he was flown to hospital by air ambulance. The Marines said they had been drilled properly and had the right kit and were all prepared for the training exercise. They . were all wearing dry suits, their own military clothing, a helmet, a . knife to free themselves if they got snagged, a smoke flare and an . uninflated life jacket. Soldier B said: ‘It was quite an upsetting experience. This was a tragic accident.’ Soldier . F said the exercise was part of a boat handlers course for Royal . Marines and said this was the first time he had lost a 'student in troop . training'. He said losing both engines on the RIB was a 'freak accident'. Soldier D estimated that Mr Woodland was in the water for between 'one minute and 90 seconds'. He said: ‘There was nothing more we could have done to save him.’ Marine Woodland's fiance Sian has set up a charity in honour of her partner who tragically drowned while on a Special Forces training exercise in 2012 . The inquest heard that Mr Woodland, who was a strong swimmer, was a 'fit and healthy man' who died from 'immersion in water, drowning'. He had not suffered any significant . injuries but the weight of the boat on top of him and the 'subsequent . disorientation resulted in his drowning', medical experts told the . inquest. Soldier E . told the inquest there had been capsizes during exercises in the past. But he said: ‘It was not what was intended but it may happen.’ He . said the two RIBS were to 'punch through the surf' but the boats were . not competing against each other and there was no time pressure. He . said: ‘In my opinion it was a tragic accident. Nothing more could have . been done to help Paul, the incident happened so quickly.’ Coroner Dr Elizabeth Earland concluded the inquest by recording a verdict of accidental death. She said: ‘The RIB went into the surf and hit a very large wave, six foot plus.’ She said the swamped boat capsized and Mr Woodland became trapped by the engines and drowned.

Qadam Shah Shaheem, commander of the Afghan army's 111 Military Corps Kabul, said yesterday that one Taliban fighter was killed when his suicide vest exploded and the other two attackers were shot. Eight people, including two foreigners, were rescued from the building in Kabul's western Karte Seh district during the four-hour gunbattle, according to yesterday's reports. Those reports had initially claimed that two people died in the attack. It is not known whether those rescued subsequently died of their injuries or whether more bodies were subsequently found. 'The attackers first shot dead the director as they entered the building,' Gen Zahir said at a press conference. The South African's son and daughter were also killed, as well as an Afghan citizen. After the event, Kabul police spokesman Hashmat Stanakzai told AFP that Gen Zahir had resigned. 'General Zahir Zahir told the interior ministry he no longer wanted to continue his job.

Security: Afghan commandos arrive at the site of a Taliban attack on a foreign aid workers' guest house . Embattled: Police and soldiers stand side by side following the attack in Kabul last night . Fatalities: The dead body of a foreigner lies in the back of an ambulance after the attack last night . The most-recent Kabul attack came as Afghan army soldiers fought Taliban fighters inside Camp Bastion, the major southern base handed over to Afghans by British forces in October. A few dozen Taliban fighters with automatic weapons and suicide vests had attacked the base in Helmand province on Thursday, General Ayatullah Khan, commander of the army regiment in the area, said. 'Some managed to get inside, took position, and started the gunfight,' he said, noting that the insurgents appeared to be holed up in one of the smaller camps within Camp Bastion. At least five soldiers and 26 insurgents were killed on Friday at the base, Omar Zwak, a spokesman for Helmand's governor, said. The Taliban, who were ousted from power by the U.S.-led coalition in 2001, claimed that hundreds had been killed in the attack. The insurgents routinely inflate casualty figures. The attacks point to a still-potent Taliban insurgency, and raise concerns about whether Afghan security forces can control militants after the U.S. and NATO officially conclude their 13-year combat mission this year. Afghanistan's Interior Ministry has launched a public awareness campaign to encourage Kabul residents to help prevent attacks, said its spokesman Sediq Sediqqi. 'We are requesting our people to cooperate with their security forces in identifying suspicious people in their areas and preventing terrorist attacks,' he said.

"Poor white Americans are seeing their life expectancy decrease in trend that is close to what happened during the collapse of the Soviet Union. Researchers have found that white women who did not finish high school saw the steepest decline and lost five years of their lives between 1990 and 2008. White men with a similar education died three years earlier than they should have over the same period. Worrying: The life expectancy for poor white Americans has dropped dramatically . Worrying trend: Chart shows how the life expectancy of whites without a high school degree has fallen in recent years . Black and Latino men and women, however, all saw their life expectancy rise. A similar study, presented by the  Pan American Health Organization, found that the average life expectancy in Latin America has risen from 29 years in 1900 to 74 years in 2010, Fox News Latino reported. The researchers were appalled that in the US, the richest country in the world, people were living shorter lives and said the findings were ‘deeply troubling’. Until now rising life expectancies have been a given in the developed world and that decreases only happened in war-torn African countries. But a combination of unhealthy lifestyles, obesity and prescription drug overdoses appear to be changing that. The research found that a lack of education was the key factor - white women who did not finish high school lived to 78.5 years in 1990 but just 73.5 years in 2008. By comparison white women who finished college lived for 83.9 years. Men saw a drop from 70.5 to 67.5 years over the same period but when you factor in education, the gap was even bigger. School's out: Those who did not finish high school saw the steepest decline in life expectancy . The researchers found that those who finished college lived for 80.4 years respectively - 13 years more than their less educated equivalents. Lead researcher S. Jay Olshansky, a public health professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said that such life expectancies were on a par with those seen in America in the 1950s and 60. And at the same time, black men and women- even if they had a poor education - saw their numbers steadily rise. John Haaga, head of the Population and Social Processes Branch of the National Institute on Aging, said: ‘We’re used to looking at groups and complaining that their mortality rates haven’t improved fast enough, but to actually go backward is deeply troubling’. The decline has caused America to shoot down the international league table of life expectancy, the New York Times reported. Unhealthy lifestyles: A rising number of obese people is partly to blame for the shift, researchers found . According to the UN’s Human Mortality Database, American women were 14th place in 1985 but were in 41st in 2012. Among developed countries, American women were bottom. Michael Marmot, director of the Institute of Health Equity in London, said that a five year decline in life expectancy was like what happened in the former Soviet Union when it broke up. Men lived seven years less on average than they did before due to rampant alcoholism, high levels of smoking and a healthcare system that had fallen apart.

"Our most common male ancestor, ‘Adam’, has finally got his original birthdate – and its 9,000 years earlier than scientists believed. UK researchers claim that ‘Adam’ walked the earth 209,000 years ago, contradicting a recent study that suggested the Y chromosome predated humanity. Their findings puts 'Adam' within the timeframe of his other half 'Eve', the genetic maternal ancestor of mankind. Our most common male ancestor walked the earth 209,000 years ago - earlier than scientists commonly thought - according to new research from the University of Sheffield . The study, conducted by Dr Eran Elhaik from the University of Sheffield and Dr Dan Graur from the University of Houston, claims to put ‘Adam’ in his rightful place in evolutionary history. The team dated ‘Adam’ using existing genetic data.  To calculate the age of the Y chromosome they multiplied data on the average age that fathers have their first child with the number of mutations of they uncovered. The team dated 'Adam' using conventional biological models to identify private, derived gene mutations on this lineage . Results . of a separate study announced in August last year suggest that Adam and . Eve lived in Africa at the same time - but probably never met. It . was previously believed that ‘Y-chromosomal Adam’ and ‘Mitochondrial . Eve’ - the most recent common ancestors to males and females - lived at . completely different times. But . a study of 69 men from around the world found ‘Y-chromosomal Adam’ walked the Earth between 120,000 and 156,000 years ago, much earlier . than previously believed. It places him nearer to Eve who was around 99,000 to 148,000 years ago the analysis found. The researchers at Stanford University, California, say it is ‘extremely unlikely’ they were exact contemporaries. Initial estimates for the male MRCA ranged from between 50,000 to 115,000 years ago. Geneticist . Professor Carlos Bustamante, of Stanford University, California, said: . 'Previous research has indicated the male most recent common ancestor . (MRCA) lived much more recently than the female MRCA. But now our . research shows there is no discrepancy.' They then divided this figure by the mutation rate of the Y chromosome – or how many years it took on average for the mutation to appear. ‘Of course, we can manipulate each one of these variables to make a finding look younger or older,’ Dr Elhaik told MailOnline. ‘In our paper, we showed the previous study manipulated all these variable to predate the Y chromosome.’ ‘We can say with some certainty that modern humans emerged in Africa a little over 200,000 years ago,’ he added. ‘It is obvious that modern humans did not interbreed with hominins living over 500,000 years ago.

"How well do you know your man? All it took was a simple check on Facebook for a woman to discover her husband had already said his vows with another woman - three other women, in fact. The woman from South Carolina, whose identity has been been protected by the Newberry County Sheriff's Office, filed a complaint with investigators after she saw wedding photos of her husband, 49-year-old Darnell Pixley, with another woman on Facebook. After looking online she found that her husband was already married to at least three other women and had divorced another. Bit of a player! A simple check on Facebook led a woman down a deep rabbit hole of discovery that ended with the revelation that her husband was already married to at least three other women and had divorced another . Newberry County Sheriff Lee Foster said 49-year-old Darnell Pixley was charged on a single count and surrendered to deputies Wednesday . A little more snooping around and she uncovered a marriage license from the November 2013 ceremony. 'Then she decided that she wanted to follow through with it. As absurd as it sounds, and as kind of bizarre that it might be that a man would have multiple wives, it is illegal,' said Sheriff Lee Foster to KLTV. Pixley was arrested Wednesday and charged with bigamy. 'He was not in to wanting to talk to us about it,' said Foster. 'He had made just a few comments regarding that he thought maybe it was a misunderstanding, but past that, he didn't have anything else to say.' Didn't have a clue: Darnell Pixley married this lady in November, but it was only after looking him up on Facebook she found out about his polygamist habits! Sheriff Lee Foster said Pixley married a woman in Edgefield County in 1988. He also married a woman in Richland County in 2008, a woman in Sumter County in 2011 and a woman in Newberry County last November . On Pixley's Facebook profile he shows a photo of himself last November with a caption reading in part, 'on my honeymoon,' to some apparent surprise from his friends. 'You got married?' one asked. 'Yes he married,' replied another. The investigators found two other women to whom Pixley was married. The marriages date back to 1988.Pixley has married four women in four different cities and counties. His most recent was last November. He knows all about the ta-tas! The investigation into the marriages of Darnell Pixley began in June when one of his wives saw a November Facebook post saying he was on his honeymoon, a surprise since she wasn't with him . The woman filed a complaint, Foster said. And as deputies probed further, they found out that Pixley had married four women - one each in the South Carolina counties of Aiken, Newberry, Richland and Saluda - starting in 1988 . The story gets evern stranger as it was revealed that online court records show Pixley was granted a $2,500 personal recognizance bond with an order to have no contact with any of his alleged wives. 'It didn't appear that they were completely shocked, but they didn't have any clue, I don't think, of what was going on,' said Foster, however his most recent bride seems to be supportive. Pixley will have to go to criminal and family court and could face jail time. Complicated past: Pixley - who entered North Augusta as his home on his MySpace page and Florence on his MeetMe page but has no location on Facebook - was released on a $2,500 personal-recognizance bond and has an October 24 court date .","Darnell Pixley, 49, was arrested after wife number three allegedly found out about wife number four and contacted authorities ."
"Millions of customers will soon be able to speak to a bank adviser ‘face-to-face’ – without having to travel to their nearest branch. Barclays and Coutts, the Queen’s bank, are both launching a ‘Skype-style’ conferencing service, enabling customers to make a video call to a member of its call centre staff via their smartphone, tablet, laptop or home computer. But while Barclays last night hailed it as a ‘watershed moment’ in the way people do their banking, campaigners warned its campaign to close branches and introduce new gadgets risked alienating many of its elderly customers. The High Street giant claims its service will be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week – with customers able to use it from the comfort of their home, or on the move . The High Street giant claims its service will be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week – with customers able to use it from the comfort of their home, or on the move. The lender even promises customers will be automatically matched to a specific member of staff they have spoken to previously, if available. They will first have to download a video banking app on their smartphone or tablet, and will have to answer questions to prove their identity. Video banking is the latest move in Barclays’s so-called ‘digital revolution’, which has ranged from finger vein scanning technology, to contactless payment wristbands and the ‘pingit’ service allowing customers to send or receive money using just a mobile phone number. The scandal hit lender described it as a ‘banking first’. But Coutts, owned by Royal Bank of Scotland, said yesterday it started testing out a similar system on around 2,000 of its well heeled customers last Thursday. It plans to extend the service to all 72,000 of its customers if it works well, while RBS plans to test it out on some of its small business customers. Campaigners have complained that banks risk alienating many customers, including the elderly, who still rely heavily on their local branches and are often not comfortable with technology . Steven Cooper, chief executive of personal banking at Barclays, said: ‘This is a watershed moment for the way people do their banking in the UK – where we will finally be able to interact with customers completely on their terms rather than ours.’ The new technology is part of Barclays’ plans to close down many of its 1,546 branches in a bid to slash costs. Like other High Street lenders, it claims that customers are increasingly doing their banking online or on their smartphones, and visiting branches less. Persuading customers to use video banking will bolster its case for further branch closures. But campaigners have complained that banks risk alienating many customers, including the elderly, who still rely heavily on their local branches and are often not comfortable with technology. James Daley, founder of Fairer Finance said: ‘By getting rid of branches you begin to exclude people who are unable to bank in any other way. Many older people are just not comfortable dealing with their finances online.’ Barclays’ wealthier ‘Premier’ customers will receive an email next Monday (December 8) inviting them to use the video banking service. Businesses, mortgage and investment customers will have to wait until early next year. Barclays says all its retail customers, including its 12 million current account holders, will be able to use the service by the end of next year. It already offers video banking in some of its branches.","Barclays hailed it as ‘watershed moment’ in way people do their banking .

"A 'huge' limestone tomb belonging to an important Egyptian physician has been discovered. Archaeologists at Abusir Archaeological Cemetery at Giza have unearthed the final resting place of Shepseskaf ‘ankh that has been undisturbed for 4,500 years. The generous size of the tomb, which is 69 by 45 feet long and 13 feet high, indicates the importance of the ancient medical professional, who was Head of Physicians of Upper and Lower Egypt in the Fifth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom. Archaeologists at Abusir Archaeological Cemetery at Giza have unearthed the final resting place of Shepseskaf 'ankh that has been undiscovered for 4,500 years. The generous size of he tomb indicates the importance of the ancient medical professional . Vice head of the Ancient Egyptian sector, Ali ALasfar, said a large door covered in hieroglyphs revealed that its occupant is the 'Priest of Khnum,' or 'Priest of Magic'. The false door with the name, title and images of its owner is located inside a chapel where the tomb itself was found, Fox News reported. The door in the eastern part of the tomb also says that the medicine man was one of the most important royal physicians in Ancient Egypt at the time. The large door covered in hieroglyphs and Images of Shepseskaf 'ankh himself . It is the third tomb of a physician discovered in Abusir Cemetery, which is an enormous necropolis close to modern Cairo and served as an elite burial place for the Ancient Egyptian capital of Memphis. Antiquities Minister Ibrahim Ali, said: 'This discovery is important because . this is the tomb of one of the greatest doctors from the time of the . pyramid builders; one of the doctors closely tied to the king.' The necropolis where the tomb was found is part of a vast pyramid field that stretches from north Giza to Saqqara and was designed to supplement Giza, which was already filled up with funeral monuments of the 5th Dynasty pharaohs, Heritage Daily reported. The physician's tomb makes up part of a 21 by 14 metre plot surrounded by walls four metres tall that is thought to belong to a family. The archaeologists must have been relieved to find the tomb and highly-carved door intact, as parts of the site, along with Saqqara and Dahshur was damaged by looters during the Egyptian protests in 2011. Ancient Egyptian physicians used numerous methods to heal patients but many of their techniques were also based on religious beliefs and most physicians were also priests. It was common for different priests to . act as specialist medics, as they believed that different gods . governed different parts of the human body. Much of what is known about the priests and doctors comes from ancient papyrus manuscripts that reveal the cures they used as well as how they performed operations and used surgical implements to remove cysts and tumours. Some of the 'cures' composed of 600 drugs and 800 procedures, developed by the ancient physicians - such as applying direct pressure to cuts - are still used today.

"Tony Blair today insisted it was not his job to save the Labour party as he gave lukewarm support to Ed Miliband's beleaguered leadership. The former prime minister was repeatedly pressed on live TV about the crisis in the Labour party, insisting it was 'not a topic for me' and only eventually conceding Mr Miliband has his 'full support'. And after Mr Miliband's week of dire headlines and warnings many want him to quit, Mr Blair told him bluntly: 'That’s what leadership is about.' Scroll down for full transcript . Former Prime Minister Tony Blair today insisted it was not his job to rescue the Labour party, and told Ed Miliband that bad headlines was what leadership is all about . Mr Blair met Mr Miliband at the weekend when they attended the Remembrance Sunday ceremony at the Cenotaph. Sunday's newspapers were dominated by headlines about concern at the highest levels of the Labour party that Mr Miliband's poor personal ratings could cost the party victory next year. Grilled on Sky News today, Mr Blair insisted he did not discuss Labour's woes with Mr Miliband at all. And he seemed reluctant to even discuss the prospects of the party he led to three historic election victories. Mr Blair was being interview by Sky presenter Kay Burley about the work of his foundation in Sierra Leone to tackle Ebola. But Ms Burley said she was sure the former PM would accept some questions about Labour . Mr Blair replied curtly: 'I don’t know what makes you sure I’ll accept it, because I don’t really want to talk about that today.' Insisting he did not want to discuss Labour at all, adding: 'What’s going on in politics back home I will comment on when I’m back home.' Sky News presenter Kay Burley repeatedly pressed Mr Blair for his views on the party he led to three election victories, but he insisted he did not want to talk about it . When it was suggested that his former colleagues might appreciate some advice from the election winner, Mr Blair replied: 'I doubt it.' On Mr Miliband's torrid time amid mounting criticism of his stewardship of the Labour party, Mr Blair insisted: 'Exactly, that’s what leadership is about and I'm sure he is robust enough to take it.' Asked if Mr Miliband was the 'right man for the job', Mr Blair replied: 'I have had these things a thousand times and I’ve always said he has my full support and that’s the end of it, so… you know…' When it was suggested he might 'ride back into town and save the Labour party', Mr Blair retorted: 'Well that’s not my job nowadays.' The interview was then quickly brought to a close. Support for Mr Miliband has plummeted even among his party's supporters. Pollsters YouGov found that only 34 per cent of people who voted Labour at the last General Election believe Mr Miliband is up to the job of Prime Minister, compared to 51 per cent just a month ago. The sheer scale of the unhappiness is also highlighted by the fact that 45 per cent of those who voted Labour in 2010 believe he should quit as party leader. An opinion poll by Lord Ashcroft put Labour on just 29 per cent, the same level of support secured by Gordon Brown in the 2010 general election. A new opinion poll by Lord Ashcroft put Labour on just 29 per cent, the same level of support secured by Gordon Brown in the 2010 general election . Alan Johnson last night ruled out replacing Mr Miliband as Labour leader, saying he would ‘never’ take the job. The popular former home secretary threw Mr Miliband a lifeline by warning rebel MPs that he will not step in if the beleaguered leader is ousted. It comes after claims up to one in five of Mr Miliband's frontbenchers was ready to call on him to go, with Mr Johnson favourite as a caretaker leader. ‘I have never stood for the leadership of my party, and for the avoidance of doubt, regardless of the circumstances, I never will,’ he told The Guardian. His comments are a blow to rebel MPs who want Mr Miliband to go for the sake of the party, as Mr Johnson is viewed as one of the few figures who could unite Labour in the six months before the election. Mr Johnson said Mr Miliband was ‘entitled to our loyalty’. But he revealed that he had turned down Mr Miliband’s request to take a senior front line role in the election campaign, saying that he would only offer informal help from the backbenches. Earlier, Mr Miliband attempted to get on the front foot after enduring days of sniping from his own side, by giving a major speech on Europe to the CBI. But his woes pursued him to the business organisation’s conference in London, where one delegate asked him whether he now wished he had lost the leadership to his elder brother David. ‘Certainly not,’ Mr Miliband snapped back. Kay Burley: While we’ve got you I’m sure that you would accept a question or two about the Labour party here back home in the United Kingdom at the moment. We saw you at the cenotaph on Sunday with Mr Miliband... Tony Blair: I don’t know what makes you sure I’ll accept it, because I don’t really want to talk about that today. KB: I’m sure. But while I have if I could possibly ask you… . TB: You’re going to ask me anyway. KB: I am, obviously. Did you talk at all about his leadership woes while you were at the Cenotaph? TB: Actually I didn’t. But in any event that’s not a topic for me today. KB: Can I ask why not? TB: Because I am here dealing… I am building my team, I spending the entire day concentrating on Ebola and what my foundation is doing with others to try and curb it. And you know…. Something like… what’s going on in politics back home I will comment on when I’m back home. KB: Do you not think though that the Labour party back here would really appreciate maybe just sixty seconds of comment from you? TB: I doubt it. KB: Oh, I’m sure they would. TB: I’m sure you might. KB: How much sympathy do you think Ed Miliband should… or how much sympathy do you have for his plight, he is having a tough week. You used to have lots of bad headlines. TB: Exactly, that’s what leadership is about and I'm sure he is robust enough to take it. So um… if you have got nothing on Ebola I think I’ll return to what I am doing here. KB: I will ask you one more question about Ebola but before that could I just ask do you think he is the right man for the job? TB: Oh please Kay, honestly. I have had these things a thousand times and I’ve always said he has my full support and that’s the end of it, so… you know… . KB: And from you are going on to Guinea and Liberia, what are you doing there? TB: So my foundation also works in those countries as well and has worked for some period of time and now the teams have obviously been diverted on to fight Ebola, but we are also trying to give though as to how this whole part of West Africa once Ebola is out of the way, how the economy recovers here. ‘Cos obviously for the future its important these countries recover and go back on to a forward path. KB: OK just before you go you are not going to ride back into town and save the Labour party are you? TB: Well that’s not my job nowadays. Right now I am in Freetown Sierra Leone… . KB: We’ll leave you to it.","Former Prime Minister insists he does not want to discuss Labour .
