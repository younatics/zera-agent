"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- More troops, new legislation, improved troop training and added civilian expertise highlight President Obama's strategy to fight terrorism in Afghanistan and Pakistan. President Obama, here with Hillary Clinton on Friday, calls the situation in Afghanistan ""increasingly perilous."" Obama on Friday announced his plan to tackle what he called an ""international security challenge of the highest order."" Stressing soberly that ""the safety of people around the world is at stake,"" Obama said the ""situation is increasingly perilous"" in the region in and around Afghanistan, where the United States has been fighting al Qaeda and the Taliban for more than 7½ years after attacks in New York and at the Pentagon. ""The United States of America did not choose to fight a war in Afghanistan. Nearly 3,000 of our people were killed on September 11, 2001, for doing nothing more than going about their daily lives,"" said Obama, who has vowed to make Afghanistan the central front in the fight against terrorism. ""So let me be clear: Al Qaeda and its allies -- the terrorists who planned and supported the 9/11 attacks -- are in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Multiple intelligence estimates have warned that al Qaeda is actively planning attacks on the U.S. homeland from its safe haven in Pakistan.  Watch how the U.S. will target terrorist safe havens » . ""And if the Afghan government falls to the Taliban -- or allows al Qaeda to go unchallenged -- that country will again be a base for terrorists who want to kill as many of our people as they possibly can."" Obama said it is key Americans understand that Pakistan ""needs our help"" against al Qaeda. ""Al Qaeda and other violent extremists have killed several thousand Pakistanis since 9/11. They have killed many Pakistani soldiers and police. They assassinated [former Pakistani Prime Minister] Benazir Bhutto. They have blown up buildings, derailed foreign investment and threatened the stability of the state. Make no mistake: Al Qaeda and its extremist allies are a cancer that risks killing Pakistan from within.""  Watch Obama's speech on Afghanistan, Pakistan threats » . Flanked by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Obama called on Congress to pass a bipartisan bill co-sponsored by Sens. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, and Richard Lugar, R-Indiana. The legislation authorizes ""$1.5 billion in direct support to the Pakistani people every year over the next five years -- resources that will build schools, roads and hospitals and strengthen Pakistan's democracy,"" he said. He also urged Congress to pass legislation that would create opportunity zones in the border region. The goal is to develop the economy and bring hope to places plagued by violence. Obama said, ""We will ask our friends and allies to do their part,"" including at a donors conference next month in Tokyo, Japan. ""After years of mixed results, we will not provide a blank check. Pakistan must demonstrate its commitment to rooting out al Qaeda and the violent extremists within its borders. And we will insist that action be taken -- one way or another -- when we have intelligence about high-level terrorist targets. "" Obama said the United States must work with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund and others to help Pakistan get through the economic crisis. ""To lessen tensions between two nuclear-armed nations that too often teeter on the edge of escalation and confrontation, we must pursue constructive diplomacy with both India and Pakistan."" Afghan President Harmid Karzai watched the speech on CNN from Kabul, said Richard Holbrooke, Obama's special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Karzai ""is extremely grateful and will issue his statement of support,"" Holbrooke said. Obama stressed that ""Afghanistan has been denied the resources that it demands because of the war in Iraq"" and now a commitment must be made. Obama said he is sending another 4,000 troops to Afghanistan, along with hundreds of civilian specialists, such as agricultural experts, educators and engineers. The troops -- which are in addition to the 17,000 announced earlier -- will be charged with training and building the Afghan army and police force. The stakes are high as al Qaeda and the Taliban have escalated the insurgency and the number of U.S. troops deaths spiked last year -- the highest yearly death toll for them in the war. Obama said the soldiers and Marines ""will take the fight to the Taliban in the south and east"" and will work with Afghan troops along the border. He said such an effort will bolster ""security in advance of the important presidential election in August.""  Watch Obama tell terrorists U.S. will defeat them » . Obama said the coalition ""will accelerate"" efforts to ""build an Afghan army of 134,000 and a police force of 82,000 so that we can meet these goals by 2011 -- and increases in Afghan forces may very well be needed as our plans to turn over security responsibility to the Afghans go forward."" He said Afghanistan's government has been ""undermined by corruption and has difficulty delivering basic services to its people"" and its economy is undercut by ""a booming narcotics trade that encourages criminality and funds the insurgency.""  Watch Obama's remarks on the Afghan situation » . Obama said the United States will set clear benchmarks for international assistance and won't ignore attention to corruption. He said the United States will develop a new contact group for Afghanistan and Pakistan that would include not only NATO allies and other partners but also Central Asian states, Gulf nations and Iran, Russia, India and China. Reacting to Obama's plan, Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wisconsin, said he is pleased the president is focusing on al Qaeda and is addressing the role of Pakistan but expressed concern the strategy could remain ""overly Afghan-centric."" Citing Friday's suicide attack on a mosque in the Pakistani tribal region near Afghanistan, Feingold said, ""This new administration must ensure that we do what we must not only in Afghanistan but also in Pakistan."" He said, ""As the bombing near the Khyber Pass this morning highlights, we need to fully address the inextricable links between the crisis in Afghanistan and the instability and terrorist threats in Pakistan."" The bombing killed at least 48 people and wounded 80 to 90 others. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell praised Obama's plan, saying it is ""a significant pivot"" away from the Democratic Party's left wing. ""So the president's decision to continue Secretary Gates, follow [U.S. Central Command chief] Gen. [David] Petraeus' advice -- which may be somewhat exasperating to his own political left -- I think is in the best interest of the country and I think he's going to enjoy pretty strong Republican support for the plan,"" the Kentucky Republican told reporters.","Intelligence shows al Qaeda planning attacks on U.S., President Obama says .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Coca-Cola, the world's largest soft drinks group, has bought a minority stake in Innocent, the British fruit drink and ""smoothie"" maker that boasts of its ethical stance. Coca-Cola faces allegations about labor abuses as well as health and environmental concerns. Innocent said on its Web site the U.S. firm had paid £30 million ($44 million) for a stake of ""between 10 and 20 percent"" to fund plans to expand in Europe. Innocent employs 275 people, has a turnover of more than £100 million and sells about two million smoothies each week. Its three founders, who set up the company 10 years by selling smoothies at a London music festival, insisted its ethical stance would not be compromised and they would continue to run and manage the business. Are ethics and business compatible? Tell us what you think . ""Every promise that Innocent has made -- about making only natural healthy products, pioneering the use of better, socially and environmentally aware ingredients, packaging and production techniques, donating money to charity and having a point of view on the world -- will remain,"" co-founder Richard Reed said. ""We'll just get to do them even more."" Coca-Cola ""has been in business for over 120 years, so there will be things we can learn from them. And in some small ways we may be able to influence their thinking too."" James Quincey, group business unit president for Coca-Cola Europe, said: ""We are delighted to have the opportunity to invest in Innocent's future. We have long admired their brand, their products and their unique approach to business."" But the investment is sure to open up Innocent to charges that its ideals are being diluted. Coca-Cola has been criticized over negative health effects resulting from consumption of its products. It has also faced allegations about labor abuses in Colombia and environmental concerns in India, among other places. Sales of Coke are holding up well amid the global economic crisis thanks to strong growth in China and India. In February the company reported a 4 percent rise in sales volumes in the last three months of 2008 and a 10 percent increase in comparable earnings.","Coca-Cola buys a minority stake in Innocent, the British fruit drink maker .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Pirates in ships are searching for the lifeboat containing four pirates and their hostage -- the captain of a freighter they failed to hijack earlier this week -- according to a U.S. military official with knowledge of the situation. Capt. Richard Phillips of the Maersk Alabama is being held by pirates on a lifeboat off Somalia. The pirates are using ships they have already hijacked and larger ships from which they are launching skiffs, the official said Friday. One of the pirated ships is the German cargo ship Hansa Stavanger, seized April 4 off the coast of Somalia. The U.S. military has been monitoring communications between the pirates, the official said. The guided missile frigate USS Halyburton, with helicopter capabilities, has now joined the guided missile destroyer USS Bainbridge in the area. A third ship, the amphibious assault ship USS Boxer, which has a large medical facility on board, will be there within a day. Richard Phillips, the hostage, tried to escape from the pirates Thursday night by jumping out of the lifeboat, a U.S. official said Friday.  Watch what it's like inside a lifeboat » . Phillips was believed to be trying to swim to the USS Bainbridge, which is in communication with the four gunmen holding Phillips in the 28-foot boat off Somalia's coast, the official said. Some of the kidnappers jumped into the water, recaptured Phillips, and returned him to the lifeboat, according to the official.  Watch what happened when captain tried to escape » . The pirates fired shots, the military official said, but had no further details. A Defense Department official told CNN that Phillips appeared to be tied up by the pirates after the escape attempt. The U.S. official -- who did not want to be named because of the sensitive nature of the situation -- said the escape attempt is being viewed by negotiators as an ""optimistic sign"" that Phillips is in good health. He has been held since Wednesday, when the hijackers seized control of his U.S.-flagged ship, the Maersk Alabama.  Watch expert talk about hostage escape attempts » . The captain's wife Andrea Phillips thanked everyone for their support in a statement. ""My husband is a strong man and we will remain strong for him,"" she said. ""We ask that you do the same. "" Phillips' 20-man crew regained control of the vessel, and they and the vessel are en route to Mombasa, Kenya, according to the father of one of the crew members. The ship's owners -- the Norfolk, Virginia-based Maersk company -- would not say how the crew regained control. ""There will be time for due diligence and retrospective review once we have the safe return of all parties and the opportunity for a full debriefing,"" it said in a statement. For the U.S. Navy, the show of strength is more than just a means to resolve a hostage situation, said Chris Lawrence, CNN's Pentagon correspondent. Attacks in the area have picked up so drastically in recent months that the Navy has to reposition some of its fleet to deal with the threats, he said. iReport.com: How should the U.S. respond? The pirates have shown no signs of giving in. The Maersk Alabama was on its way to Mombasa, Kenya, with a cargo of food aid when it was attacked Wednesday. It was the first time in recent history that pirates had targeted an American ship. The ship was hijacked some 350 miles off Somalia's coast, a distance that used to be considered safe for ships navigating in the pirate-infested waters. CNN's Mike Mount and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","NEW: Shots fired in escape attempt, captain apparently tied up, military officials say .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- The Department of Veterans Affairs has launched an investigation into whether there is a connection between improperly sterilized endoscopy equipment and a veteran's positive HIV test. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, requested that the VA look into potential contamination at its facilities. This comes after more than 10,000 veterans were possibly exposed to HIV and hepatitis at three VA facilities while undergoing colonoscopies and other procedures with equipment that had not been properly cleaned. The VA sent letters to those veterans offering free testing for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV. ""The VA prides itself on being accountable, and we are extremely concerned about this matter, and as a result we have initiated an investigation,"" Dr. Michael J. Kussman, the VA's undersecretary for health, said in a news release Friday. ""We have an obligation to provide those who have served and sacrificed for our Nation the care they deserve."" Along with the positive HIV test, the VA says 16 other veterans have tested positive for hepatitis B and hepatitis C at two VA facilities. Of all the 17 positive test results, 11 were at the VA's Murfreesboro, Tennessee, facility, and six were from the VA's Augusta, Georgia, hospital. Thousands of other veterans are being tested at the VA hospital in Miami, and the VA says it is waiting to verify results there. So far, 3,174 veterans have been notified of their test results. VA officials decline to say where the veteran who tested positive for HIV was treated.  Watch more on the contamination controversy » . Officials stress that the positive results don't necessarily mean the equipment is to blame. The VA is conducting an epidemiological investigation at the facilities to determine if the veterans who have tested positive for hepatitis have similar strains of the virus. Meanwhile, lawmakers are also calling for an investigation. In a letter last month to Gen. Eric Shinseki, the secretary of Veterans Affairs, Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, requested that the VA Office of Inspector General ""begin an investigation into the potential problems of contamination; whether any patient has contracted an infection from unsterilized equipment; and, most importantly, how we can prevent such problems from happening again."" The VA says it's reviewing procedures at other facilities. So far, it says, it has encountered no additional problems. In the meantime, the VA has brought in additional personnel to help with testing and counseling in Miami, Murfreesboro and Augusta. It has also set up a toll-free number that VA patients and their families can call, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for additional information: 1-877-575-7256. The VA says it will pay for treatment for the infected vets even if they didn't get hepatitis or HIV from the dirty equipment. ""We are making sure to take corrective measures to ensure veterans have the information and the care necessary to deal with this unacceptable development,"" Kussman said.","Agency seeing whether veteran's AIDS infection, endoscopy equipment linked .

"(CNN) -- For fans of The Beatles, 09/09/09 will mark a new invasion. The Fab Four will be made even more so when the remastered Beatles catalogue is released in September. Apple Corps Ltd. and EMI Music have announced that as the date for the release of the entire original Beatles catalogue, digitally remastered. That includes all 12 Beatles albums in stereo, with track listings and artwork as originally released in the UK. The package will also contain the LP version of ""Magical Mystery Tour"" (initially released as a double-EP in Britain, though available on CD since 1987) and the collections ""Past Masters Vol. I and II"" combined as one title. The release marks the first time that the first four Beatles albums are being made available in their entirety on compact disc, and it also coincides with the release of ""The Beatles: Rock Band"" video game. Robert Levine, executive editor for Billboard, said the timing is genius in terms of marketing. ""Most bands, when they do a big project like this they pay for publicity,"" Levine said. ""The Beatles got paid for 'Rock Band' and then they are using that for publicity to rerelease a catalogue. It's pretty amazing."" Blog: A Beatles fan reflects on the news . Levine pointed out that media have evolved tremendously since 1964, when the band first burst onto the American scene with an appearance on ""The Ed Sullivan Show."" Back then, there were only three major television networks, and engineering of albums was much less sophisticated, Levine noted. Previous rereleases have sold well in the past -- indeed, Beatles albums have sold steadily for decades -- and Levine said he expects this one to do even better. ""I think if you were to look at pure catalogue, old bands selling old albums, the Beatles are the kings -- commercially as well as artistically,"" Levine said. ""A lot of [music] has been remastered better in the past 22 years, and remastering technology has come a long way."" Piers Hemmingsen, the author of two books on Beatles music and head of the Web site Capitol6000.com, said there has long been a clamor among fans for good, high-quality versions of Beatles songs. ""The technology that was available back then was very limited, and with the newer technology they are able to do far more with what they have than they have ever been able to do before,"" he said. ""For people who are plugged into iPods and the whole digital music scene, it's going to be a lot better for them."" In acknowledgment of the more technologically advanced listeners, each CD will contain, for a limited time, an embedded brief documentary film about the album. The documentaries contain archival footage, rare photographs and never-before-released studio chat from the Beatles. The remastering project was four years in the making. Engineers used de-noising technology and cleaned up glitches like electrical clicks and microphone vocal pops, so long as it didn't affect the original integrity of the songs. They also slightly boosted the volume levels. Andrew Croft, publisher of Beatlology Magazine, said the announcement of the release of the remastered recordings ""is long overdue in the Beatles community and for music fans alike."" He also said the quest to improve the original recordings is not new. Croft said bootleg releases over the years used rare and obscure vinyl pressings from countries like Japan and Germany to compile the best of the best recordings of The Beatles songs, presenting to the public a better sound that Apple could not offer prior to the remastering. ""While the new remasterings will replace a library full of bootlegs of their commercial releases, there remains a massive market for their more obscure tracks, outtakes and live performances,"" Croft said. The 14 remastered albums, along with a DVD collection of the documentaries, will also be available for purchase together in a stereo boxed set. A second boxed set, ""The Beatles in Mono,"" includes all of the Beatles recordings that were mixed for a mono release.  It will contain 10 of the albums with their original mono mixes, plus two additional discs of mono masters (covering similar ground to the stereo tracks on ""Past Masters""). The mono ""Help!"" and ""Rubber Soul"" discs also include the original 1965 stereo mixes, which have not been previously released on CD. These albums will be packaged in mini-vinyl CD replicas of the original sleeves with all of the original inserts and label designs. Even with the release date, what is old has become new. Diehard Beatle-ologists may take note that the release date could be viewed as a nod to the Beatles track ""One After 909"" from the ""Let It Be"" album -- or a reference to the White Album's ""Revolution 9."" (John Lennon, who was born on October 9, occasionally talked about his fondness for the number 9.) Hemmingsen said making the music more accessible and attractive to a younger audience helps spread Beatlemania to a new generation. ""Their music is catchy, memorable, interesting and listenable,"" said Hemmingsen, who was a youngster in England when the Beatles hit the scene and has been a fan ever since. ""The time that they evolved their music was an interesting time and their music reflected that time."" Levine said the band has always captured fans from across generations. ""The songs have lasted for a long time because they are great songs,"" he said. ""It's just that simple. Those are amazing, amazing albums.""","The Beatles' remastered catalogue will be released in September .

"(CNN) -- Madonna is in Malawi this week attempting to adopt a second child from the African nation. A judge ruled Monday that she will have to wait until Friday to learn a decision. Dominic Nutt of Save the Children UK has urged Madonna to rethink her adoption of a girl from Malawi. In the meantime, a children's group is saying that she should not adopt and that the child would be better off in her own country. Madonna has brushed off questions from reporters, saying it is ""none of their business."" CNN's Kiran Chetry, spoke with Dominic Nutt, the spokesman for Save the Children UK, Monday on  ""American Morning."" Chetry: You heard Madonna ... say it's no one's business. Over the weekend, you came out, though, and urged Madonna to rethink this adoption. What is your biggest concern? Nutt: Well, our biggest concern is that we believe that in the most -- in the majority of cases, orphans, so-called orphans, in fact [are] not orphans -- they have at least one parent living -- and even those that don't, have a wider family that can look after them. And we believe that children in poverty should be best looked after by their own people in their own environment. And that people like Madonna and organizations like Save the Children are best off helping those families by building schools and supporting them to look after these so-called orphans and not transporting them to live across the world in mansions, in pop stars' mansions, that sort of thing.  Watch charity explain position on international adoptions » . Chetry: Now, Madonna also is doing both, I guess you could say, because she founded that organization, Raising Malawi, right, back in 2006, did a documentary as well, trying to bring attention and money to the plight of the children there. Nutt: Well, absolutely right. So she's obviously accepted the logic of the Save the Children argument, it's help children on the ground. If you really do love a child and you want the child to do well, then help them in their own world. Now, look ... something like 10 million children a year die across the world because of poverty before the age of 5. You cannot possibly help all those children by moving them. amFIX: Your thoughts on whether Madonna should adopt . So, what we're saying clearly is not that Madonna is wrong or families and parents or want-to-be parents who do go for international adoption are wrong. But it must be a last resort. They must make sure there is no family network to support them, and if they don't help that child, that child is in peril. The life of that child is in peril. Otherwise ... you are better off supporting that child in its own environment. Chetry: All right, well, here's what a couple of people who actually live there say. One of them is a resident of ... Malawi, who said, ""We're poor people. If a child's mother dies, it's hard for the man to bring the child up."" He's saying that because apparently in this situation, the child she's trying to adopt, Mercy James, both -- neither parent [is] living, according to our report. And then I want you to hear also from the Law Commission of Malawi, one member of it, and what he said about this adoption. Let's listen. Unidentified male: If you project 20 years from now, where will the child be if the child is left in the orphanage where it is, or if it gets a chance to get an education with Madonna. Chetry: The figures also from UNICEF show that for every 1,000 births in Malawi, 120 children die. The life expectancy in that country is only 44 years old. And most children over the age of 10 do not attend school. So, wouldn't life be better for some of these children who have no living parents, who would at least be in another country where their basic needs could be met and they could get a decent education? Nutt: Well, would it not be better to solve the problems of Malawi and help Malawians solve their own problems by educating their children and feeding their children and helping their children so they can get off that cycle of poverty? Not just literally transporting the whole population of Malawi. If we are concerned about the population of Malawi being in a very difficult situation, we can't transport them all to Queens in New York or to Kensington in London to make that difference. The difference has to be made on the ground. Otherwise, we really are shuffling the deck chairs on the deck of the Titanic. Chetry: All right, well, they're not necessarily mutually exclusive. So, the question that I have is: Is your issue really with Madonna? I mean, you mentioned celebrity and living in mansions. But what about just ... some middle-class ... working people who are unable to have children themselves and would like to try to help out a child in need overseas. Are you against that type of adoption? Nutt: No, no. All I'm saying is that it's definitely a last resort. Because I know the pain of trying to have a child. I've been trying, my wife, for years, and we just got lucky four weeks ago. But I know that heartache and that lack of being able to bring up a child in a loving environment. But we know from our case studies in working in Liberian orphanages that in many cases, these children are [picked] off the Internet, without much research going on, and sometimes it doesn't work out, and the children can be sent back to their own country. And all that has happened is that that child's life has been messed around with. So, of course, it's difficult. And I wish I could give you an easy answer and offer you a magic wand, but if you challenge poverty on the ground in these countries, you can in the end do very well by these children. Save the Children's been doing it for 90 years across the world, and it's making a difference. ... You say it's not mutually exclusive, of course, but you can bet your bottom dollar that by investing in children, you'll get a much bigger impact and better outcome than by taking one or two children here and there as a matter of willy-nilly choice. Chetry: All right, Dominic Nutt, spokesman for Save the Children UK, thank you for your point of view this morning. And we also want to let people know that we did reach out to Madonna's spokeswoman. So far, we're just getting ""No comment.""","Save the Children spokesman: Children should be raised by extended family .

"(CNN) -- Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's energetic response to Monday's earthquake has been generally praised despite his comparison of the ordeal of survivors staying in emergency tents to a camping weekend. An elderly local resident bursts into tears during a visit by Silvio Berlusconi, wearing a fireman's helmet. Berlusconi has visited the town of L'Aquila, the epicenter of the 6.3-magnitude quake, every day this week, talking to survivors and pledging government help to rebuild houses. He scrapped a visit to Russia that was planned for this week. The PM has even been greeted with applause on occasions, according to CNN correspondent Paula Newton, who interviewed him on Wednesday. ""He was very tired when I saw him, you could tell he hadn't had much sleep,"" Newton said. ""In general he thrives on these events and politically it will probably give him a boost, if only temporarily."" However, she added that his visit to a dormitory where students were buried under rubble had upset some of the parents and relatives. ""They were kept well back and he did not meet with them,"" she said.  Watch Berlusconi talk about the disaster »  (Italian version) » . ""One relative, in obvious anger, asked another 'why is he here?' and another replied ""he's taking care of elections, of course."" And true to form Berlusconi has been unable to avoid putting his foot in it. During a visit to one tent village where thousands who had lost their houses were staying, Berlusconi told German television ""they should see it like a weekend of camping."" The trademark gaffe sparked predictable outrage. ""He is a completely insensitive man who thinks wisecracks can solve every problem,"" Rina Gagliardi, a former senator of the Refoundation Communist Party, told Agence France-Presse. ""He can never be negative, but an earthquake disorients him because he can't blame the left for causing it, so his response is extreme optimism,"" she said. Berlusconi is of course renowned for such off-the-cuff remarks. In November he described Obama as ""handsome and suntanned."" He was also forced to issue an apology to his wife, Veronica Lario, in 2007 after she read reports of him approaching several women at an awards dinner and declaring: ""If I wasn't married, I would marry you straight away."" Lario received the apology after sending a letter criticizing her husband to a newspaper in which she said his behavior was ""unacceptable"" and ""damaging to my dignity."" Despite the most recent criticism, Berlusconi has won praise from the media for his limelight-hogging visits to the region. People in the temporary camps also say they are being well looked after by the authorities although they are desperate to collect their own things from their homes. In his interview with CNN on Wednesday Berlusconi said every effort was being made to assess which houses were safe to enter. ""This is an aerial view of Onno, and you can see, unfortunately, how the town has been totally destroyed,"" the prime minister told CNN. ""Here, we can go into greater detail and concentrate on individual houses. This helps us to assess the damage right away and tells us how much it will cost to rebuild."" The Italian government has said it will cost 1.3 billion euros (1.7 billion dollars) to repair or rebuild about 10,000 buildings damaged in the quake. ""We have the plans for reconstruction and intend to start immediately with the building projects,"" Berlusconi told CNN. ""We will build a new town near the capital, L'Aquila, and keep the possibility open for many families to stay, for the time being, in hotels along the coast, less than a hour away, in pleasant and comfortable circumstances."" Berlusconi said the plan for the new town would involve low-rate mortgages. ""This is not an alternative to the reconstruction,"" he said Wednesday. ""These are additional houses.""","Italy PM's response to Monday's earthquake has been generally praised .

"MONT TREMBLANT, Quebec  (CNN) -- Natasha Richardson came to Mont Tremblant ski resort in eastern Canada last month for what was supposed to be a skiing getaway. Actress Natasha Richardson died after suffering an epidural hematoma in a fall during a ski lesson. But what she may not have known is some doctors have been arguing that if a person here is in need of urgent care at a medical trauma center, he or she may not be able to get there fast enough. The only way to get to the closest trauma center from here is to drive 2½ hours to Montreal. No helicopter medical service is available. The Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail obtained 911 recordings from Monday, March 16, when Richardson fell on a beginners slope on a sunny, clear day at the resort. The first request for help came in at 12:43 p.m., an urgent call that a woman had fallen on the slopes. That woman was Richardson. Seventeen minutes later, at 1 p.m., an ambulance arrived, but Richardson had been able to walk away from the fall and was headed back to her hotel room. Ten minutes later the ambulance was told to stand down, the call canceled. What Richardson couldn't have known is that she suffered an epidural hematoma. It's a condition where a blood clot forms between the skull and the outer layer of the brain. Too much pressure can cause brain damage and even death. Symptoms include dizziness, headaches and nausea. ""The person seems to be fine and walks it off, and that's one of the problems with an injury such as this,"" said Dr. Liam Durkan, a neurologist with the Montreal Neurology Institute. ""Anytime there is any sort of process expanding in the skull, which is a closed space, once the symptoms are apparent, it can be a matter of 30 minutes to an hour to 90 minutes before there is a major deterioration."" Two hours after her initial fall, while Richardson was back in her hotel room, she was feeling the symptoms. The clock was ticking and she needed to get to a trauma center fast. With the closest trauma center 2½ hours away, time may have been running out on her. It's recommended that anyone with an epidural hematoma get to the trauma center within 30-90 minutes. At 2:59 p.m., another ambulance was dispatched to the resort. This time, the paramedics went inside and worked on Richardson for 33 minutes before transporting her to the closest hospital an hour away, but it is not a trauma center. Inside the ambulance, Richardson drifted in and out of consciousness. ""It is a rapidly deteriorating situation and the distance might have been just too much by ambulance, road ambulance or air ambulance. It's difficult to say,"" said Durkan, who did not treat Richardson. Depending on the severity of the injury at the time, he said, even helicopter services may have been too late. Some trauma doctors have argued for air transport here since the mid-1990s. They say the safest and fastest way to move anyone suffering a trauma injury such as Richardson's is by helicopter. Helicopter transport is common practice in the United States and other areas of Canada. But in the Quebec region, very few places have access to air transport. In an open letter to the citizens of Quebec sent to the Montreal Gazette, Dr. Michael Churchill Smith, director of professional services at the Montreal General Hospital, said incidents like Natasha Richardson's should serve as a wake-up call to Quebec. ""It is no longer morally acceptable for our citizens who, in the moment of their greatest needs, do not have access to a rapid transit system that gives them the best chance to not only survive, but to survive with a quality of life."" Daniel LeFrancois, director of Quebec's pre-hospital care, told the Gazette that cost is prohibitive when a one-hour flight costs $6,000. It's a question of resources and priorities focusing on ""the biggest gain for the biggest need,"" he said. Richardson was taken from Mont Tremblant to a hospital in St. Agathe, which does not have the facilities to help someone with a severe head trauma. Richardson was transferred to the trauma center in Montreal about 7 p.m., more than six hours after her initial fall. Twenty-four hours later she was flown to a New York hospital, where she was taken off life support and died. No one can answer the question whether a helicopter service could have saved Richardson's life. She refused services immediately after her fall, but with the clock ticking immediately after she felt symptoms from her injury, 2½ hours may have been too far away even if she'd gotten help immediately.","Resort where Natasha Richardson was injured is 2½-hour drive from trauma center .

"ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- Regular programming has just been interrupted by a news conference. A slender black man in a suit steps up to a podium, flanked by American flags and a White House logo. Michael Lamar was laid off in January but has a new job as a Barack Obama look-alike. ""I wish I could announce such an economic package,"" he says, ""but there is a bank in Turkey that did it. It is Garanti. I wish we had Garanti in America."" Don't be fooled. This is a commercial on Turkish TV. The actor is a 44-year-old Barack Obama look-alike from Whitehall, Pennsylvania, named Michael Lamar. And he is shilling for a Turkish bank. In the month before the real Barack Obama is to visit Turkey, this ad campaign went out all across the country on television and on billboards, using the iconic, Warholian image of the American president to sell low-interest loans. The ""Mad Men"" behind the concept say their Obama look-alike was the perfect guy to sell what they described as Garanti Bank's own economic stimulus package. ""We probably wouldn't be doing this commercial if it was the previous president,"" said Can Celikbilek, a copy writer at the advertising company, Alametifarika. ""But in the case of Obama, he does represent hope, not only for the States but for the whole world."" For Obama look-alike actor Lamar, there was some irony about getting flown to Turkey to star in a commercial for a bank. He is a recent casualty of the global economic crisis. ""I was laid off in January of this year from JP Morgan Chase Bank in the U.S.,"" Lamar said, in a telephone interview from Pennsylvania. ""After 18 years in the company, I was just laid off. One of the cutbacks. I'm currently unemployed right now."" Or, was unemployed. Lamar's striking resemblance to the American president has suddenly offered the former software analyst a possible new career for supporting his wife and child. ""I'm available full-time now,"" Lamar said. ""I'm going to see where this leads me."" Lamar is now being represented by a casting agency in Los Angeles that specializes in celebrity look-alikes. Since he discovered his new ""talent,"" he has traveled to the Netherlands to appear in a commercial for a liquor chain and to Paris, where an activist organization brought him in to meet lawmakers at the National Assembly, as part of a campaign to raise awareness about racism and racial profiling in France. ""This was very exciting for me, a true privilege!"" Lamar said. During his brief visit to Turkey, locals did double-takes when they saw Lamar walk past. ""Even in the studio, the crew [members] were like, 'Oh! Is that Obama?"" said Celikbilek of Alametifarika advertising. Using the image of an American president to promote anything in Turkey is a remarkable reversal. U.S. approval ratings in Turkey plunged to 9 percent, according to a 2007 Pew Research poll, making America less popular in Turkey then almost anywhere else in the world, even though the two countries are NATO allies. There was widespread anger among Turks at the war in neighboring Iraq. But the election of Barack Obama appears to have dramatically improved perceptions of America. ""Bush was a dictator who attacked other countries,"" said Abdurrahman Ozdemir, who sells cigarettes from a small stall on the street. ""But we love Obama ... because he does not want to go to war with other countries."" ""We started to love and like America because of Obama,"" said a 33-year-old woman named Begum Arinc. ""I don't want to see people dying. I don't want to see any war. That's why I want to believe in Obama.""","Michael Lamar strikes an Obama-like figure in ads for a bank in Turkey .

"(CNN) -- Josef Fritzl, the Austrian man accused of keeping his daughter in a cellar for decades and fathering her seven children, will go on trial March 16 on six charges including murder and incest. Josef Fritzl admitted fathering seven children by his daughter during her 24-year captivity. The Austrian Press Agency reported Thursday the trial was expected to last about five days and be held behind closed doors. Further details about the case would be announced Friday, it said. Fritzl, 73, was charged in November with incest and the repeated rape of his daughter, Elisabeth, for 24 years. But he was also charged with the murder of one of the children he fathered with her, an infant who died soon after birth. State Prosecutor Gerhard Sedlacek said Michael Fritzl died from lack of medical care. In all, Fritzl faces six charges at trial: murder, involvement in slave trade (slavery), rape, incest, assault, and deprivation of liberty, Sedlacek's office said. If convicted, he could face life in prison. The case first came to light in April 2008 when Elisabeth's then-19-year-old daughter, Kerstin, became seriously ill with convulsions. Elisabeth persuaded her father to allow Kerstin to be taken to a hospital for treatment. Hospital staff became suspicious of the case and alerted police, who discovered the family members in the cellar. Fritzl confessed to police that he raped his daughter, kept her and their children in captivity, and burned the body of the dead infant in an oven in the house. Elisabeth told police the infant was one of twins who died a few days after birth. When Elisabeth gained her freedom, she told police her father began sexually abusing her at age 11. On August 8, 1984, her father enticed her into the basement, where he drugged her, put her in handcuffs and locked her in a room, she told police. Fritzl explained Elisabeth's disappearance in 1984 by saying the 18-year-old girl had run away from home. He backed up the story with letters he forced Elisabeth to write. Elisabeth Fritzl and all but three of her children lived in the specially designed cellar beneath her father's home in Amstetten, Austria, west of Vienna. The other three children lived upstairs with Fritzl and his wife; Fritzl had left them on his own doorstep, pretending his ""missing"" daughter Elisabeth had dropped them off. Under Austrian law, if Fritzl is convicted on several offenses, he will be given the sentence linked to the worst crime. In addition to murder, he will face the following charges: .","Josef Fritzl accused of keeping daughter captive for decades, on trial March 16 .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The federal government is establishing a new system for updating medical records of servicemen and women during and after their military careers, President Obama announced Thursday. President Obama made veterans' affairs a big priority in the 2008 campaign and continues to do so. The joint virtual lifetime electronic record will, among other things, help ensure a streamlined transition of health care records between the Pentagon and the Veterans Administration. It will provide ""a framework to ensure that all health care providers have all the information they need to deliver high-quality health care while reducing medical errors,"" the White House said in a background statement. ""When a member of the armed forces separates from the military, he or she will no longer have to walk paperwork from a [Defense Department] duty station to a local VA health center. Their electronic records will transition along with them and remain with them forever,"" Obama said in remarks delivered near the White House. The system will ""cut through red tape"" and allow new veterans to start receiving their benefits more quickly, he promised. During the announcement, Obama was joined by Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki. ""We welcome this news. ... This is a huge day for veterans and troops,"" Paul Rieckhoff, head of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, told CNN. ""This is a good way for [Obama] to come back from Iraq and make a powerful statement."" The White House recently proposed a significant budget increase for the Veterans Administration, including an 11 percent hike in fiscal year 2010. In March, however, the administration abandoned a controversial plan to charge private insurers for treatment of veterans' service-connected ailments. Veterans' representatives and members of Congress angrily opposed the proposal, which White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said was never finalized.","NEW: ""This is a huge day for veterans and troops,"" chief of veterans group says .

"Editor's note: Julian E. Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School. He is completing a book on the history of national security politics since World War II, to be published by Basic Books. Zelizer writes widely on current events. Julian Zelizer says it's not enough for Republicans to oppose Obama's plans, they must offer their own ideas. PRINCETON, New Jersey (CNN) -- One of the best Marx Brothers movies, ""Horse Feathers,"" played in movie theaters at the height of the Great Depression in 1932. In the film, the comedian Groucho Marx played the new president of Huxley College, Quincy Adams Wagstaff. During one of the most memorable scenes, Groucho introduces himself to faculty and students by singing about his philosophy of governance: ""Your proposition may be good/But let's have one thing understood/ Whatever it is, I'm against it!/And even when you've changed it or condensed it, I'm against it/ I'm opposed to it/On general principle. I'm opposed to it."" If Republicans want to rebuild their party after the calamity of 2008, the party leadership needs to avoid the Quincy Adams Wagstaff approach to politics. When Obama proposed his economic recovery bill last week, the first words to come out of House Minority Leader's John Boehner's mouth sounded a bit like Wagstaff. With the economy imploding and the international economic crisis worsening, Boehner said: ""Right now, given the concerns that we have over the size of the package and all of the spending in this package, we don't think it's going to work. And so if it's the plan that I see today, put me down in the 'no' column."" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has been more restrained in his response, leaving open the door to compromise. If Boehner is simply acting as Dr. No to get a better deal, Republicans can come out of the negotiations over the economic recovery bill as partners, planting the seeds for a new Republican approach toward dealing with economic matters. But if Boehner's plan is for his party to act as an oppositional force -- trying to block, delay and prevent legislative action -- then the GOP could find itself in big trouble. If the Republicans don't agree with Obama's approach, given the severity of the crisis, they need to offer an alternative rather than just sitting still. To be sure, there is the possibility that if the economy continues to deteriorate after a bill has passed and the public loses faith in Obama, the House GOP could reap the benefit from their opposition. They could say ""we told you so."" But even that would be a high-risk maneuver, particularly given the state of public opinion about the Republican Party. Even if a bill passes and the economy continues to struggle, voters would be looking at a Republican Party that didn't have anything better to offer. The public likes hard-working politicians. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal ideas didn't always work -- some like the National Recovery Act were downright failures -- but voters valued a president who tried to offer arguments about how to end the crisis and who rolled up his sleeves to make the nation better. The election of 2008 revealed that the Republican Party lacks the kind of big ideas that Ronald Reagan used in 1980 to bring the conservative movement into power. The various factions of the conservative movement came together around the themes of anti-communism, deregulation and tax cuts. Reagan didn't just sell tax cuts for the wealthy as good in themselves, but connected them to supply-side economics, which claimed that cuts would stimulate investment, generate economic growth and ultimately bring more revenue into the coffers of Treasury. Even after the Soviet Union collapsed, Republican leaders found ideas to sell their movement to the public. Newt Gingrich and a cohort of young Republicans focused on sharp attacks about the dangers of government intervention and corruption of government. For a short time it seemed that under George W. Bush, the war on terrorism would provide a new thematic focus to Republican efforts. But this was not to be. The controversies over Iraq and the continued dangers in countries such as Afghanistan undermined Republican claims of superiority on national security policy. Controversies over the erosion of civil liberties and due process in the pursuit of terrorism also weakened their claims. When the economy collapsed in fall 2008, Republicans' arguments about the wisdom of tax cuts and deregulation were made suspect. Americans might not always like government, but they dislike being broke even more. Sen. John McCain struggled in his campaign, not just because of the weaknesses of his campaign, but because his party seemed to lack any answers as Wall Street and Main Street spun out of control. Furthermore, the fact that the federal government continued to expand under Bush -- both when Republicans and Democrats controlled Capitol Hill -- made it difficult to sell Republican arguments about the dangers of big government. Back in the 1970s, when Republicans felt as if they were in the political wilderness, they invested a great deal of their resources into the market of ideas. Conservatives built think tanks like the CATO Institute, established talk radio shows, and financed academic scholarship about conservatism so that when opportunities arose in the elections of 1980 and 1994, Republicans had something to say. At some point, Republicans have to tap into the 1970s enthusiasm about generating ideas if they want to rebuild their party and win over the hearts and minds of voters. Simply reviving the philosophy of the 1970s won't work. Rather the GOP needs to offer new arguments and new policies to achieve economic recovery. If they repeat what happened in the 1930s, when Republicans sounded a lot like Groucho Marx and just said no as FDR rebuilt the nation, they are likely to remain on the outskirts of power for decades to come. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: House Republicans are signaling they will oppose stimulus plan .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- A suspected U.S. missile struck a village Wednesday in Pakistan's tribal region, killing three Taliban militants and wounding four others, according to local officials and media reports. People inspect the damage from a suspected U.S. missile strike in northwest Pakistan last month. The strike is the 12th missile attack this year, compared with three attacks during the same period in 2008. The missile -- fired from an unmanned drone -- was targeting a pickup truck carrying suspected militants near the town of Wana in South Waziristan in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas, according to Nasim Dawar, an official with the South Waziristan administration. Witnesses and intelligence sources said the drone was flying low and the militants fired at it before the missile strike, Dawar said. Two nearby shops were destroyed in the missile attack, he said. The U.S. military in Afghanistan routinely offers no comment on reported cross-border strikes. However, the United States is the only country operating in the region known to have the capability to launch missiles from drones, which are controlled remotely.

"NORFOLK, Virginia (CNN) -- Negotiators aboard a U.S. Navy warship are trying to secure the release of an American freighter captain who is being held by pirates on a lifeboat off the coast of Somalia, according to Maersk Line Ltd. Capt. Richard Phillips of the Maersk Alabama is being held by pirates on a lifeboat off Somalia. The crew aboard the destroyer USS Bainbridge could see the lifeboat where pirates have been holding Capt. Richard Phillips since Wednesday, the company said in a written statement issued at 5 p.m. ET. Phillips has not been hurt, the statement said. Phillips, who has received provisions and batteries for his radio, has been in touch with the crews of the Alabama and the Bainbridge, the statement said. The pirates are the same four men who hijacked Phillips' vessel, the U.S.-flagged Maersk Alabama, early Wednesday hundreds of miles off the Horn of Africa. The Alabama's 20-person crew later regained control of the ship, which is owned and operated by the Norfolk-based Maersk Line Ltd. In a written statement, Maersk spokesman Kevin Speers noted that ""there have been many questions about how the crew re-captured the ship and how the captain came to leave the ship."" But he would not clarify the matter. ""Our immediate focus has been to bring the current situation to a safe resolution,"" he said. ""There will be time for due diligence and retrospective review once we have the safe return of all parties and the opportunity for a full de-briefing."" The U.S. Navy, which is in charge of the situation, requested the help of the FBI. FBI negotiators in the United States are in touch with the crew of the Bainbridge, which arrived on the scene earlier Thursday to assist, a senior U.S. defense official said. According to Maersk's last communication with the Navy, the 28-foot lifeboat was disabled and ""dead in the water,"" Speers said Thursday morning. ""We are encouraged that most of the crew is safe. They have been resilient and courageous throughout this crisis,"" Speers said. ""But we will remain on watch, staffing our situation room and our family hot line until this situation is resolved and the captain is safely returned."" On Thursday, the Maersk Alabama resumed its journey to Mombasa, Kenya, with an 18-person armed security detail on board, according to Joseph Murphy, the father of the ship's first officer. Maersk and U.S. military officials confirmed the cargo ship had left the area on Thursday, but would not say where it was heading, citing security concerns.  See how pirate attacks have increased » . Gen. David Petraeus, chief of U.S. Central Command, said Thursday that the Bainbridge would be getting backup shortly. ""I can tell you, there are definitely going to be more ships in that area in the next 24 or 48 hours, because there are two more sailing to it right now,"" he said. ""Needless to say, we want to ensure we have all the capacity that may be needed over the course of the coming days."" Vice Adm. William E. Gortney, commander of U.S. Naval Forces Central Command, told CNN's Barbara Starr in Bahrain that, ""We have been moving forces in that direction."" White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said President Obama had been staying apprised of the situation. ""Obviously, his main concern is for the safety of the captain and the rest of the crew on the ship, and he will continue to receive those updates,"" he said. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said an international coalition of countries is working to address the piracy threat, but the area in question is immense. ""I think the ocean area we're referring to is three times the size of Texas,"" she told reporters. iReport.com: 'Stop the pirates, Obama!' Referring to continuing problems with piracy in those waters, she said instability in Somalia has contributed to the flourishing of ""an old scourge.""

It was the first time in recent history that pirates targeted an American ship.  Watch how pirates work off Somalia » . The pirates were armed with AK-47 assault rifles while the ship's crew carried no weapons, according to Ken Quinn, the second officer of the ship. Crew members managed to take one of the four pirates hostage, Quinn said. The crew -- apparently minus the captain -- locked themselves in the compartment that contains the ship's steering gear, where they remained for about 12 hours with their captive, whom Quinn said they had tied up.  Watch Quinn describe the hijacking to CNN » . The pirates reneged on their agreement to exchange Phillips for one pirate whom the crew had captured. The pirate was released unharmed, according to Quinn, who spoke to CNN on Wednesday via a satellite call. The pirates had scuttled the small boat they used to reach the ship, Quinn said, so Phillips offered them the Alabama's 28-foot lifeboat and some money. ""We returned him, but they didn't return the captain,"" Quinn said. The U.S. Navy issued a warning several days ago to ships in the area that pirates were operating farther offshore.  Watch former Navy captain discuss options » . There are emergency rations to last 10 days on the lifeboat, but the conditions are most likely ""uncomfortable,"" according to Murphy. ""There's no toilet facilities or anything like that,"" he said. ""The captain has a VHF radio, and I'm sure that he's in voice communication with the ship itself. The problem is, of course, that ... the [radio's] battery is going to die, and I'm not really sure how they're going to continue communication after that."" iReport.com: How should the U.S. respond? It is common for crews of merchant vessels to travel through the area unarmed despite the risk of pirate attacks, experts said. An armed crew could provoke a firefight that would endanger the crew's lives or its cargo, which often contains flammable or explosive material. John Reinhart, chief executive and president of Maersk Line Ltd., said the crew can try to outrun the pirate boats or turn fire hoses on anyone trying to board the ship, ""but we do not carry arms.""

"(CNN) -- A man who was sought by police in Texas after four children were burned with sulfuric acid has turned himself in, authorities said Monday. Tracy Lynn Escobedo is taken into custody for allegedly burning four children with sulfuric acid. Tracy Lynn Escobedo, 27, called CNN affiliate KXII-TV and asked that a crew videotape him as he turned himself in Sunday. ""I would never throw acid at nobody. It was an accident,"" Escobedo says repeatedly on the video as he surrenders to Cooke County sheriff's deputies. ""I ran because I was scared. I hurt my kids. It was an accident. ... I would never hurt my kids. I love them."" Escobedo is charged with four counts of injury to a child, the sheriff's office said. The children involved were ages 14, 7, 4, and 18 months, authorities said. In the incident last week near Gainesville, Texas, a container of sulfuric acid ruptured in a pickup truck, police said. Cynthia Stout -- a woman believed to be the mother -- and three of the children were left at a cafe by Escobedo, who took the baby with him, authorities said. Escobedo then gave the baby to another woman, believed to be a relative, at a residence, authorities said. When police arrived at the cafe, Stout attempted to flee and resist arrest, but was taken into custody, authorities said. She was being held on suspicion of child endangerment. It was unclear why sulfuric acid was in the truck. Cooke County Sheriff Michael Compton said all four children are being treated at Parkland Hospital in Dallas, Texas. Speaking to CNN early Monday, Compton said the condition of the 7-year-old ""is not very good, I don't think. The others are stable.""

"(CNN Student News) -- February marks the beginning of Black History Month, a federally recognized, nationwide celebration that provides the opportunity for all Americans to reflect on the significant roles that African-Americans have played in the shaping of U.S. history. But how did this celebration come to be, and why does it take place in February? We should emphasize not Negro History, but the Negro in history. What we need is not a history of selected races or nations, but the history of the world void of national bias, race hate, and religious prejudice. - Dr. Carter G. Woodson (1875-1950) on founding Negro History Week, 1926 . Dr. Carter G. Woodson, considered a pioneer in the study of African-American history, is given much of the credit for Black History Month, and has been called the ""Father of Black History."" The son of former slaves, Woodson spent his childhood working in coalmines and quarries . He received his education during the four-month term that was customary for black schools at the time. At 19, having taught himself English fundamentals and arithmetic, Woodson entered high school, where he completed a four-year curriculum in two years. He went on to receive his Master's degree in history from the University of Chicago, and he eventually earned a Ph.D from Harvard. Disturbed that history textbooks largely ignored America's black population, Woodson took on the challenge of writing black Americans into the nation's history. To do this, Woodson established the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History. He also founded the group's widely respected publication, the Journal of Negro History. In 1926, he developed Negro History Week. Woodson believed that ""the achievements of the Negro properly set forth will crown him as a factor in early human progress and a maker of modern civilization."" Woodson chose the second week of February for the celebration because it marks the birthdays of two men who greatly influenced the black American population: Frederick Douglass (February 14), an escaped slave who became one of the foremost black abolitionists and civil rights leaders in the nation, and President Abraham Lincoln (February 12), who signed the Emancipation Proclamation, which abolished slavery in America's confederate states. In 1976, Negro History Week expanded into Black History Month. The month is also sometimes referred to as African-American Heritage Month.

"(CNN) -- Chronic seizures can present a risk for adolescents, whose bodies and metabolism are changing. Jett Travolta was the elder of John Travolta and Kelly Preston's two children. A seizure disorder caused the death of Jett Travolta, the 16-year-old son of actors John Travolta and Kelly Preston, a source at a Bahamas funeral home told CNN. ""Literally dozens of different disorders can cause seizures: genetics, stroke, brain tumor, lack of oxygen, low blood sugar, drugs, even certain medications,"" said Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent. Another expert said the teen years bring risks for those with seizures. ""Adolescence is a time, even if you don't talk about children with any seizure disorder, where things change in a child,"" said Dr. Shlomo Shinnar of Montefiore Medical Center in New York. There are effective drugs to treat seizures. As children grow, their bodies and metabolism change, perhaps causing a need to adjust their dosage, said Shinnar, a professor of neurology and pediatrics and director of the Comprehensive Epilepsy Management Center at Montefiore. ""Seizures during adolescence can get better or worse or stay the same,"" he said. And the risk of seizures is higher for children with disabilities such as autism and cerebral palsy, Shinnar said. Jett Travolta had a developmental disability that his parents have linked to Kawasaki disease, an inflammatory disorder of the artery walls that most commonly occurs in young children. An autopsy of the actors' son was completed Monday, and the body was cremated that evening, the funeral home source said. Jett was found unconscious in the bathroom Friday while on vacation with his family. Michael Ossi, an attorney for Travolta, told CNN last week that Jett had a seizure that morning at the family's home in a resort area. He was taken by ambulance to a hospital and pronounced dead on arrival, according to local police. People.com reported that Travolta, Preston and their 8-year-old daughter Ella Blue arrived in Florida on Monday night with Jett's ashes.  The reports that a seizure disorder caused Jett's death were preliminary, Gupta said. ""It tells us more about what did not happen than the ultimate cause of death. It rules out brain injury, bleeding on brain, skull fractures, rules out heart problems due to Kawasaki disease, which is the disease the Travoltas say their son suffered,"" he said. Kawasaki disease, believed to be caused by an infection, inflames the heart muscles.  In 2001, Travolta told CNN's Larry King that his son had a near brush with death related to the condition. ""I was obsessive about cleaning -- his space being clean, so we constantly had the carpets cleaned. And I think, between him, the fumes and walking around, maybe picking up pieces or something, he got what is rarely a thing to deal with, but it's Kawasaki syndrome,"" Travolta said of his then-2-year-old son. Dr. Cam Patterson, general cardiologist at the University of North Carolina and a genetics expert who follows Kawasaki disease, told CNN, ""There is no real good link at all between Kawasaki disease and cleaning products. ""Kawasaki disease is due to an abnormal immunnologic response, probably to an infectious agent or infection we don't yet understand,"" Patterson said. ""There is nothing that links environmental toxins to this problem."" Someone with Kawasaki could have seizures for one of two reasons, but they would be rare, he said. ""One, sometime in the past one of the arteries in the brain ruptured and caused stroke,"" he said.  ""Two, if the artery had enlarged enough, it could be pressing on parts of brain and that could cause seizure. Both possibilities are unusual for Kawasaki disease."" A very small study released in 1991 found an association between cases of Kawasaki disease in homes where carpet had been cleaned in the past 30 days. ""It's very easy to find correlations, but doesn't mean causative,"" Patterson said. The next step would have been to conduct more tests, by taking toxicological tests and brain examinations to see what could have caused the seizure.

"Editor's Note: Jack R. Nerad is Executive Editorial Director for Kelley Blue Book and kbb.com, and co-host of ""America on the Road,"" heard on more than 300 radio stations. In the 1980s he served as Editor of Motor Trend magazine. Nerad is the author of ""The Complete Idiot's Guide to Hybrid and Alternative Fuel Vehicles,"" published recently by Alpha Books. Jack Nerad says bankruptcy would drive car buyers away from GM and imperil suppliers. (CNN) -- The events of the past week have been unprecedented in the auto industry and in the annals of American business. As the events have unfolded, there is the strong implication from the administration's automotive task force that Chapter 11 bankruptcy, followed by restructuring and ""cleansing"" of General Motors' balance sheet, is a potential scenario in the ongoing efforts to keep the giant automaker alive. GM's new chief executive, Fritz Henderson, acknowledged as much on CNN Sunday. ""You can't rule options off the table. So you basically say we will spend time to try to get it [done] outside of bankruptcy. But if we can't, we're not going to compromise our goals. We're going to get it done inside our bankruptcy. Our preferred approach is still to do it outside, but you can't rule out going in."" Over the past few weeks pundits of all stripes have appeared on financial news networks suggesting that entering Chapter 11 is GM's only way to future viability. ""Get on with it,"" they say, and save us the agony. It is the only way, they argue, General Motors can get relief from its immediate cash-flow issues, tear up or substantially modify its union contracts, dump unnecessary brands, close plants and ""right-size"" its operations. But those pundits who propose Chapter 11 fail to acknowledge that General Motors is a consumer-facing company whose success or failure is in the hands of millions of average Americans. This group will decide to buy or not buy General Motors vehicles based on what they know, hear and even feel about GM's future. As talk of imminent bankruptcy swirls in the press, the news they hear about General Motors certainly is not reassuring, as they consider which brand to buy. How does that manifest itself in the car-buying public? We at Kelley Blue Book asked 500 potential new-vehicle buyers a string of related questions that yield answers to that multi-billion dollar question. Their response is telling. Asked ""How likely would you be to buy a car from General Motors if they were to go bankrupt,"" 42.1 percent of new-vehicle buyers said they were either ""not at all likely"" or ""not very likely"" to do so. Even with a warranty guarantee from the federal government, consumers are not very enthusiastic about considering a GM purchase. Such a guarantee only moves the needle about three percentage points with 39.8 percent saying they were either ""not at all likely"" or ""not very likely"" to purchase a GM vehicle in such a situation. Asked, ""How likely would you be to buy a car from General Motors if they were allowed to keep operating but had to renegotiate their contracts and agreements with suppliers and laborers?"" the responses changed. Given that scenario, only 31.6 percent of new-vehicle buyers said they were either ""not at all likely"" or ""not very likely"" to purchase a GM vehicle, and they were out-numbered by the 41.5 percent who said they were either ""very likely"" or ""extremely likely"" to do so. While one must keep in mind that consumers don't always do what they say they are going to do, the import of this is clear: Bankruptcy puts a damper on consumer confidence and vehicle demand. There are other reasons to question the wisdom of a Chapter 11 filing as well. Beyond its potentially chilling effect on consumer demand, there is a domino effect on the supplier community. Many GM vendors have operated for years on ever-declining, razor-thin margins and are heavily dependent on GM for cash-flow. If that cash-flow ceases for even a relatively short period of time it could well send many of those suppliers into bankruptcy and force others simply to close their doors. The likely bankruptcies of supplier companies would have a ripple effect through the entire American vehicle manufacturing industry, causing hardships for the healthier companies as well. Further, while a ""quick-cleanse"" bankruptcy is contemplated, it is very difficult to imagine that the Chapter 11 bankruptcy of one of the largest industrial companies in the world would not take a year or more to unravel, rather than weeks or months. And if GM languishes in bankruptcy it is hard to imagine consumers flocking to buy its new vehicles. Nor is it likely the government would subsidize those operations through the potentially lengthy proceedings. The implications of the pronouncements made by President Obama and the auto industry task force indicate clearly that they believe a figurative hammer is needed to move the stakeholders -- the United Auto Workers union, pensioners, bondholders and creditors -- to accept settlements that are, at best, unpalatable to them. The threat of bankruptcy is that hammer. But the question should be asked: Is the hammer the task force is holding over the head of the GM stakeholders in an effort to get concessions, the same hammer that will drive away consumers and require the federal government to make larger and larger cash infusions or see GM founder? So while some toss out the idea of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy as being a magic elixir for GM, which has found itself trapped in an unprecedented credit crunch and a sharp recession, we have to believe that bankruptcy is a bankrupt idea. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jack R. Nerad.","Jack Nerad: Some argue that a quick bankruptcy is best course for GM .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Vice President Joe Biden brushed aside recent criticism by predecessor Dick Cheney that moves by the Obama administration had put the United States at risk, telling CNN on Tuesday that the former vice president was ""dead wrong."" Vice President Joe Biden sits down for an interview with CNN's Gloria Borger and Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday. ""I don't think [Cheney] is out of line, but he is dead wrong,"" he told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""This administration -- the last administration left us in a weaker posture than we've been any time since World War II: less regarded in the world, stretched more thinly than we ever have been in the past, two wars under way, virtually no respect in entire parts of the world. ""... I guarantee you we are safer today, our interests are more secure today than they were any time during the eight years"" of the Bush administration. In an interview with CNN's John King last month, Cheney said President Obama had been ""making some choices that in my mind will raise the risk to the American people of another attack."" Biden said former President Bush had not been fully aware of the country's position in the world.  Watch Biden lash out on Bush and Cheney » . ""I remember President Bush saying to me one time in the Oval Office, and he was a great guy, enjoyed being with him.  He said to me, he said, 'Well, Joe,' he said, 'I'm a leader.'  And I said, 'Mr. President, turn around and look behind you. No one's following.'  People are beginning to follow the United States again as a consequence of our administration."" ""... I think the biggest thing we're doing is, I'm operating in concert with the president,"" he said. ""There are not -- there are -- look, everybody talks about how powerful Cheney was.  His power weakened America, in my view."" But he did not deny reports of disagreement within the Obama administration as well, over the president's plan to widen involvement in Afghanistan. A report last week said Biden had warned about the possibility of getting into a quagmire, while military advisers pushed for more troops.  Watch more on Obama's Afghanistan plan » . ""Well, look. Without commenting specifically on who took what position, there was a healthy debate. There is a healthy debate within our administration."" The vice president said that he condemned a new Afghan law that would allow men to rape their wives, but that those issues were not the focus of the U.S. presence in that nation. ""I am not prepared to send American troops to die for that,"" he said. As the president made an unannounced visit to Baghdad, Iraq, on Tuesday, Biden said that he had no concerns that a recent uptick in violence in Iraq might affect plans to withdraw most U.S. troops from that country by the summer of 2010. ""I'm not worried about that at all. We will draw down along the timeline we suggested,"" the vice president said.  Watch the full interview » . Also not a concern for Biden: the possibility of an Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear facilities. The vice president said he was not worried that Israel's new government, under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, would order such an attack. ""I don't believe that Prime Minister Netanyahu would do that. I think he would be ill-advised to do that. And so my level of concern is no different than it was a year ago."" A day after North Korea's rocket test sparked alarm from world leaders, Biden called for a tougher response from Moscow and Beijing. ""What I'd like to see is a strong condemnation and a united effort on the part of the Chinese, Russians in the six-party talks to say, 'enough is enough, there will be greater sanctions, we will squeeze down even harder on North Korea,' "" he said. He added that China could ""do a great deal more,"" although he was uncertain it would. ""I think this puts the onus on China and Russia and South Korea and Japan, et cetera, along with us, to be bolder in our condemnation."" On the domestic front, Biden said that the administration's economic plan would prevent up to 4 million jobs from being lost and stabilize the economy, but that ""it will take at least another year before you start to see employment,"" and in the meantime, jobs will continue to disappear.  Watch Biden answer iReporters' questions » . ""There will be an additional job loss. ... You're not going to see reports this calendar year saying there was no job loss this month. That is not going to happen. ...There will continue to be job losses the remainder of this year. The question is will they continually go down before they begin to rebound, and employment -- we go down to zero job loss and back to employment.""

"(CNN) -- It took about 110 years and some delicate surgery on his most private parts, but Henry -- a lizard-like creature from New Zealand -- is now a dad. Henry, the oldest tuatara to mate at Southland Museum, enjoys a cold shower in his home in New Zealand. Henry, a tuatara who, as far as curators at Southland Museum in New Zealand know, had never mated before, hooked up with Mildred, a younger woman of about 80, in March. In July she laid 11 healthy eggs and, this week, all 11 of them hatched -- the last one on Wednesday. ""Eleven out of eleven,"" curator Lindsay Hazley said Friday morning. ""Bloody brilliant. We had a champagne breakfast to celebrate."" Henry was the oldest tuatara ever to mate at the museum, on New Zealand's South Island, Hazley said. Tuataras are the only living descendants of an order, related to dinosaurs, that flourished 200 million years ago. They're endangered, only living on a handful of islands in New Zealand, which makes Henry's happy news all the more important to supporters of the species. But it didn't come easy. Until about six years ago, Henry was a nasty, irritable fellow who showed no interest in mating and would attack females when they were introduced. Hazley, who has been breeding tuataras for the past 35 years, eventually had to put him in ""solitary confinement."" But in 2002, veterinarians discovered that a lump in Henry's nether regions was a cancerous tumor. They removed it and, over the next few years, his mood -- and interest in the ladies -- improved. Now, Henry lives peacefully with Mildred and two other females. Breeders are hoping he'll show interest in Lucy, who is about the same age as Mildred, later this year. Female tuataras only lay eggs every two or three years, so Mildred likely won't be interested.  Watch a curator take care of the reproducing dinosaur kin » . Henry's newfound libido does have some limits, however. Hazley said Juliet, a youthful 22 year old, appears to be too hot to handle for the centenarian -- who could live to be 200 years old if he stays healthy. ""I think he's a bit shy to mate with such a young woman,"" Hazley said. ""After a bit of experience with Mildred and Lucy, maybe he'll be interested in Juliet next year."" Maxing out at about two-and-a-half feet long, tuataras are much smaller than their ancestors. The word ""tuatara"" is derived from a Maori word meaning ""spiny back."" In Maori legend, they are messengers of Whiro, the god of death and disaster, and they were featured on one side of a New Zealand five-cent coin that was phased out in 2006. It's been a baby boom at Southland Museum lately. Hazley said another 10 babies were born to another couple recently -- swelling the ranks of the 50 or so tuataras that were already there. Friday morning, Hazley was working to install a camera so Henry's international fan base can watch him and other tuataras on the Internet. But they shouldn't expect any images of the proud dad playing with his batch of hatchlings. ""If it's small and it moves, it's food,"" Hazley said. ""He'd have them for lunch.""","110-year-old endangered male tuatara dinosaur descendant produces offspring .

"(CNN) -- The number of child abuse reports in Jamaica increased dramatically in 2008, the nation's Office of Children's Registry reported Saturday. The office received 3,784 child abuse reports last year, up from only 425 complaints in 2007, a significant increase for a nation with a population of about 2.8 million. OCR Registrar Carla Edie told the Jamaican government news service, JIS, that the people of Jamaica have become ""increasingly mindful of their legal responsibility to report such incidents,"" and are increasingly concerned about child safety, given a recent trend of violence against minors in the country. According to JIS, a police report issued late last year said that, between January 1, 2008 and November 1, 2008, 73 children were murdered and 383 cases of carnal abuse were reported. Flogging and other forms of physical abuse are a part of Jamaican culture, Justice Minister Dorothy Lightbourne told JIS in an interview. ""There are many parents who even threaten to 'murder' their children, even some as young as two years old,"" Lightbourne said. Regarding official child abuse reports, Edie also said that the large increase can be attributed to growing awareness that the Office of Children's Registry is the department responsible for tracking and acting on such information, and not other government and police agencies that handled those reports in the past. In addition, ""if someone has information of suspected child abuse and fails to make a report to the Registry, that person can be charged a maximum fee of $500,000 or-and six months imprisonment,"" Edie told JIS. In response to increased demand, the OCR will increase its operating hours and staff.","Child abuse reports in Jamaica have risen dramatically in past year, officials say .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Obama administration is abandoning a controversial plan to charge private insurers for treatment of veterans' service-connected ailments. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel met with veterans' groups on Wednesday. In an statement Wednesday night, the White House said that although the president believes the plan would raise more money for veterans' care, the administration is dropping the idea after hearing the objections of veterans groups. ""The President listened to concerns raised by the VSOs [veterans service organizations] that this might, under certain circumstances, affect veterans and their families' ability to access health care,"" the White House said. ""Therefore, the president has instructed that its consideration be dropped."" News of the change of heart originally came from Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, who disclosed the decision to reporters while meeting with a group of veterans on Capitol Hill. ""President Obama has listened to the concerns expressed by veterans' leaders and veterans' service organizations,"" Pelosi said. ""We will leave no veteran behind."" Veterans' representatives and members of Congress have angrily opposed the proposal, which White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said was never finalized. Leaders from 11 veterans groups discussed their position in a meeting Wednesday afternoon with White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel. ""We stood firm on our stance that there is no way to support charging veterans' insurance companies for service-connected treatment,"" said Jim King, executive director of AMVETS, a leading veterans' advocacy organization. Emanuel indicated that the proposal was ""a dead issue,"" King added. ""The administration was quick to say [that if veterans were] going to fight it, [the White House wasn't] going to push it."" Another attendee, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America Executive Director Paul Rieckhoff, said Emanuel was quick to come back after hearing the veterans' groups stand firm and tell them, ""Let's clarify, it is dead."" ""They made the right move -- they listened to us. Now we can move on to bigger more important issues,"" Rieckhoff said. The meeting was very short, said King. Despite the difference in opinion, King said the atmosphere was cordial and ""everybody seemed comfortable."" On Monday, the groups met with President Obama, Emanuel, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki and Steven Kosiak, director in charge of defense spending for the Office of Management and Budget. The administration saw the plan as a way of raising more than $500 million in revenues for the Department of Veterans Affairs. However, veterans groups saw it is a violation of what they said is the government's moral obligation to treat veterans injured during service to their country. In addition, they believed it would lead to veterans and their families losing their private insurance or premiums rising because of the high costs of treating many service-related injuries. The head of the Senate Veterans Affairs committee, Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii, said Tuesday his committee would ""not advance any such legislation."" His counterpart in the House, Bob Filner, D-California, said his committee wouldn't take up the proposal either. In a statement released by his office, Filner said the idea is ""DOA"" and said the budget ""cannot be balanced on the backs (or legs, or kidneys, or hearts) of our nation's combat-wounded heroes."" The president pushed back during the meeting on Monday, telling the groups that private insurance companies were getting a free ride. He challenged the veterans to come up with an alternative way to raise revenues. AMVETS planned to propose that billings be pursued more aggressively for injuries not related to service. But AMVETS director King said Emanuel didn't ask for suggestions in Wednesday's meeting. A 2008 Government Accountability Office study found that about $1.7 billion in treatment that could have been charged to private insurance never was, nor was it collected by the VA. CNN's Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","White House chief of staff meets with veterans groups .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- You don't find many churches making theatrical films. You especially don't find many churches making films starring Kirk Cameron about a firefighter in a crumbling marriage addicted to online porn. Kirk Cameron stars in ""Fireproof,"" a film he was attracted to for its many themes, he said. But that's the case for Sherwood Baptist Church in Albany, Georgia. In fact, the film, ""Fireproof,"" was the church's third movie. It was also an unexpected hit. In September it debuted at No. 4 at the box office, eventually bringing in $33.5 million and spawning two books: a novelization, also called ""Fireproof,"" which is in The New York Times' best-seller list's Top 20; and a companion journal to the movie, ""The Love Dare,"" which has sold more than 2 million copies. Last week ""Fireproof"" debuted on DVD and climbed to No. 3 on Billboard's DVD chart, beating out ""The Hulk"" and ""Saw V,"" among others. ""You don't often see movies made by churches do big numbers,"" said Billboard's Anthony Colombo. ""Having [distributor] Sony behind it helps. Having Kirk Cameron helps, but for it to come out and do 136,000 pieces [DVDs] in its first week is pretty impressive."" ""It should not be working,"" said Alex Kendrick, one of the pastors behind the film. ""All I can say is we prayed for months and asked for it to honor God."" Kendrick said that Sherwood's pastors gathered for prayer two years ago and asked God to give them an idea for their next movie. They were just coming off making ""Facing the Giants,"" a movie shot entirely in Albany on a $100,000 budget. It starred no professional actors -- just members of their church -- but made $10.2 million at the box office and sold 250,000 copies on DVD, launching the church into the national spotlight. The church leaders lit upon the idea of troubled relationships. ""Families and marriages are crumbing and we want to do something about it,"" said Kendrick, recalling the idea's genesis. ""God give us the idea. We had no clue what would happen with it."" ""Fireproof"" began with a $500,000 budget and a fresh crop of church member/actors, but the film got a left-field boost when Cameron, best known as the 1980s heartthrob from the TV series ""Growing Pains,"" read the script and asked to get involved. ""All throughout the movie ... there are issues of communications, money, sex, addiction, porn, extramarital affairs, feeling respected at work but not at home, feeling respected by friends but not at home,"" Cameron told CNN. The themes resonated with the actor and devout Christian, a husband of 17 years, and father of six, he said. That and the ""cool action scenes,"" he added. The makers of ""Fireproof"" tapped into the church market, arranging screenings for the National Baptist Pastors' convention before release and using word-of-mouth among church leaders. However, says Cameron, the film was pitched to general audiences, not necessarily Christians. ""'Fireproof' was never marketed as a Christian movie. This is a movie about marriage,"" Cameron said. ""The fact is, though, the gospel is presented, is done well, and it's a central part of the storyline."" Although many critics panned ""Fireproof"" -- ""as sincere, uncynical and subtlety-free as a Sunday school lecture,"" said Variety -- audiences embraced it. ""There's a huge market out there that's underserved. That market is there and a lot of people don't want to go there but there is a huge untapped market,"" Cameron said. Paul Dergarabedian, a box office analyst for Hollywood.com, said he was shocked when the movie debuted in the top five its opening weekend. ""With 'Fireproof,' they really cracked the code with the major success with the film and have this appeal across the board,"" he said. ""They didn't follow traditional marketing methods but they didn't need them for this film. ... Maybe that's why it worked out so well."" He added, ""You're talking about a very successful property. ... The powers that be that put this together are really on to something."" Churches are using ""Love Dare"" and its companion curriculum as a teaching tool, says publisher B&H Publishing's Andrea Dennis, who calls ""Fireproof"" ""a marriage movement."" For Valentine's Day more than 9,000 churches are scheduled to show the film, many displaying the admonition ""Fireproof Your Marriage"" on their signs. B&H believes ""Love Dare"" could hang around on the best-seller list -- where it's already been for 19 weeks -- along the lines of Rick Warren's ""The Purpose Driven Life."" And the filmmakers have kept their success close to home. Alex Kendrick said the church used the profits from the movie to buy 82 acres of land and build a recreation center for the town, equipped with eight tennis courts, eight basketball courts and an equestrian area. A baseball diamond is on the way. He's confident ""Fireproof"" will remain a successful brand. ""When something grows the only reason it happens is people say it worked and you should try it,"" Kendrick said. ""When it works and there's a legitimate impact, people want to be a part of it.""","""Fireproof"" about a firefighter having marriage problems .

"RICHMOND, Virginia (CNN) -- Lawyers for convicted September 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui urged an appeals court panel Monday to throw out his guilty plea and grant their client a new trial. They argued Moussaoui did not have an adequate defense and lacked key information to defend himself. Zacarias Moussaoui is serving a life sentence at the federal prison in Colorado known as Supermax. Legal analysts believe the appeal has only a slim chance of success. In arguments before the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, lawyers for Moussaoui said he was confused about the charges he was pleading guilty to, and he did not have access to information that would have shown he was not supposed to be part of the 9/11 plot. One defense lawyer characterized Moussaoui as ""unknowing."" Defense lawyers point to statements, later made public, from the man who plotted the attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who said Moussaoui was not intended to be a participant. Moussaoui did not know what Mohammed had said because it had been classified. ""A guilty plea that is invalid is invalid,"" defense attorney Justin Antonipillai told the three-judge panel. A Justice Department lawyer strongly countered, telling the court Moussaoui's plea was voluntary and unconditional. Referring to a letter Moussaoui sent the district court at the time of the plea, Justice Department attorney Kevin Gingras said, ""He understands what he is pleading guilty to."" Gingras told the court Moussaoui knew in general that there was information that could help his defense but chose to plead guilty anyway, thereby waiving any right to now challenge that decision. ""He understood there was stuff out there,"" Gingras said. ""He knew the gist,"" referring to redacted copies of appeal court rulings about what detainees might testify to and the 9/11 commission report. In April of 2005, Moussaoui pleaded guilty to terrorism conspiracy charges, and in May of 2006 he was sentenced to life in prison after a jury decided not to impose a death sentence. Moussaoui, who is being held at the maximum security federal prison in Colorado known as Supermax, was not in the courtroom for the hearing. It's expected to be several months before a ruling is issued. His attorney was met with mostly skeptical questioning by the judges. ""He insisted on pleading guilty and was allowed to do so only after extensive efforts to assure that it was knowing and voluntary,"" said former U.S. Attorney Kendall Coffey, adding the district judge presiding over the case tried to make sure Moussaoui's rights were protected. Moussaoui's attorneys argued his original defense team, which vehemently tried to dissuade him from pleading guilty, should have been able in an unclassified way to brief their client on the contents of the classified information so he knew the full scope of the evidence. They had ""one hand tied behind their backs,"" Antonipillai said. The judges hearing the case and the Justice Department attorney pointed out he probably would have received some of that material if he had gone to trial instead of pleading guilty. ""It is his choice to pull the plug"" on the process and plead guilty, Gingras said. Another argument made by Moussaoui's team was that he was denied the right of counsel because he could not hire a lawyer he wanted. After telling the court he did not want the court-appointed attorneys to represent him, Moussaoui tried to be his own attorney. But after constant outbursts the judge ended that effort. The court-appointed lawyers then took over the defense, but Moussaoui never had a good relationship with them. He wanted a Muslim lawyer from Texas, Charles Freeman, to be his attorney, but Freeman did not have security clearance. Moussaoui was arrested in August of 2001 in Minnesota after instructors at the flight school he was attending reported he was acting suspiciously and did not have much flying experience. Throughout his legal proceedings he changed his story -- at first claiming he was not supposed to be part of the September 11 attacks and then saying he was scheduled to fly a fifth plane that day and then reversing himself back to his original claim of non-involvement. His sentencing trial, which included evidence collected by the FBI relating to the 9/11 attacks, was supposed to showcase how a high-profile terrorism suspect could be tried in federal civilian court. But his trial ended up delayed for several years over a series of legal fights, including his attempt to defend himself, which included rants in the courtroom and the defense trying to gain testimony from some of the high-ranking al Qaeda detainees in U.S. custody. Several relatives of those who died in the 9/11 attacks traveled to Richmond for the hearing. Rosemary Dillard, whose husband was on the plane that went into the Pentagon, told CNN, ""People need to know this process works."" Abraham Scott, whose wife worked in the Pentagon, said attending the hearing shows ""we are still interested. ... We are still supporting the legal process."" Both Dillard and Scott attended every day of the 2006 sentencing trial. With the prospect that more terrorism suspects could be tried in federal courts with the promised closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, Dillard and Scott say Moussaoui's case shows the civilian trials can work. However, the appeal judges grappled with such key questions as how to guarantee a terrorism detainee access to classified information without compromising national security, and how to determine what degree of involvement in a terrorist plot is needed to justify a death sentence. Analysts say some detainees, because of evidence and other reasons, should be brought to trial in other systems. ""The extraordinary challenges of balancing national security with the rights of a terrorism defendant in a civilian trial vividly illustrate why the new administration should consider the use of military tribunals for at least some of the Guantanamo detainees,"" said former U.S. attorney Coffey.","Defense lawyers say 9/11 conspirator lacked key info to defend himself .

In some camps, they told me, rape had become so common that as many as 20 babies a month born from rape were being abandoned. As I sat inches from Adam --not his real name -- I feared the revulsion I knew I would feel at my own questions as I asked about rape and his involvement. I have interviewed rape survivors in Darfur.

Then, he says, his officers told him ""we will be taken to a patrol and then soon after that we were asked to join other people to go and burn and kill people"". That's when he says he realized he wasn't getting national service training, that in fact, he was being forced into war against his will, with his own people. ""They are black,"" he told me, noting the difference between the lighter skinned rulers of Sudan and the darker farmers of Darfur. ""I am black,"" he said, ""this shouldn't be happening."" But, he said, worse than being told to kill his own people, was that if he tried to resist, he himself would be killed. ""The order is that the soldiers at the front, and there are some people who are watching you from behind, if you try to escape or do anything you will get shot. The order is that we go to the village, burn it and kill the people."" It felt as Adam was beginning to open up a little -- not easy, given the topic, and the lights and cameras all around us. He was beginning to talk a bit more, answer questions with more than one or two words. But it was following a pattern: I'd have to lead the way. We were both waiting for the inevitable. How he came to know of rape in Darfur. And that's when he said it.  Watch warrant being issued for president » . He brought up the rape by himself. He was talking through a translator but his voice was quiet. I thought I heard anger, heard him slow and his voice drop: ""I had no choice,"" he said ""but I will say that I didn't kill anybody but the raping of the small children, it was bad"" I knew this was going to be difficult and now it had begun. What happens with the children, I asked. ""They cry out,"" he answered. ""And what happens when they cry out?"" ""Two persons will capture her while she is crying and another raping her, then they leave her there,"" came his reply. Silence. ""What do I ask now?"" I thought. Be forensic. Get the story. This is important testimony, I reminded myself. And so we continued, Adam describing in detail how soldiers raped girls as young as 12. How officers ordered them to do this to make people flee their villages, run away and never come back. Through all of this, Adam didn't once mention whether he actually had been directly involved in the raping. He said he tried to desert the army as soon as he could, but was caught and tortured. He showed me the scars where he said he was tied down beneath a tree and officers set fire to tires above him, dripping burning rubber on his body. Eventually, he said, he did get away, went to his sisters, tried joining the rebels to fight the army. But even there, his troubles were far from over. Incredibly, he said, the rebels didn't trust him; he was kept at their camp and only escaped when it was bombed by the army. The end of his story, but we weren't really done. One more question. Had he been forced to rape children? ""Yes I did, they were government orders,"" came his reply. How many? ""Well it didn't feel like raping, I was feeling very bad but as I was ordered, I had to do something. What I did was take off my trousers and lay myself on top of the girl but I didn't feel like raping, so I lay there for about 15 minutes."" I want to be sure I understand him. ""So you didn't actually penetrate the girls?"" I ask. No, he says, ""because I had no feeling for it, my penis didn't actually wake up, so there was no actual penetration,"" he replied. There were other people in the room, the translator, a cameraman, our producer Jonathan Wald, but I had forgotten they were there. My thoughts were entirely locked on Adam. What more could I ask? I was emotionally drained. There was no way of knowing whether he was telling me the truth. Only in the measure of his voice was there a clue. Here, sitting on an office chair, thousands of miles away from Darfur, the memories come flooding back. The many, traumatized women and children we've interviewed, distraught families, unable to protect themselves. The pain we put them through, to recount, to relive, their nightmares. Each time, I've asked myself can I justify the suffering these questions cause? Each time, I tell myself it is only their own accounts that can cast light on the darkened corner of humanity they inhabit. Only their own accounts that can help break their cycle of suffering. Time and again, though, it seems telling the world their stories has little tangible impact on their reality of their lives. And now I'm face-to-face with a man who says he was part of the suffering, albeit by his own account not complicit and not guilty. I am left with the thought perhaps Adam's words carry even greater power. If his story is true -- and it mirrors other accounts emerging from Darfur -- then it implicates the government in these terrible crimes. He says he has trouble sleeping at nights. I can understand why. He is not alone. Aid workers say millions of women in Darfur not only have trouble sleeping at nights, but live in fear of rape 24 hours a day.","Former soldier says he was armed with a Kalashnikov and told to kill .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Vladimir Putin spent the Russian New Year boogying to the hits of ABBA after spending $30,000 to fly a tribute band to a lake town north of Moscow. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin flew an ABBA tribute band to Russia for a private concert. According to Bjorn Again founder, Rod Stephen, Putin disco pointed to the ABBA classics ""Super Trouper"" and ""Mamma Mia"" at a gathering of only eight guests. Stephen said he received a phone call from the Kremlin prior to Christmas. ""It was pretty mad. It was the type of phone call everyone gets everyday from Moscow. I thought someone was taking the piss."" Stephen said an agent in Moscow then set the gig up, and he was told it was for Russia's ""number two."" He said the band were flown to Moscow and then had a nine-hour bus trip to Lake Valdai -- where Putin has held high-level meetings in the past -- on January 22 (the traditional date of Russian New Year's eve). ""The band and crew were searched at checkpoints by people with appropriately sized weapons,"" Stephen said. He said the band played behind a heavy gauze curtain, which made it hard for them to see the audience. However, the could make out Putin's profile and that of the other seven guests. Stephen said it was initially ""roaring"" at the venue. ""When the band started people were sitting on sofas. But then Putin was up and dancing to Super Trouper and Mamma Mia, pointing fingers up and down."" The band played for an hour before being shown out as the guests went to watch a fireworks display. Stephen said they were paid $30,000 and their expenses covered. He described it as the ""weirdest"" gig the band had done. ""I've had phone calls from the agency saying 'don't talk to anyone else we are getting grief from the Kremlin,' but there was no non-disclosure contract.""","Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has revealed a love for ABBA's hits .

"(CNN) -- Asked about part of the entertainment business he particularly enjoys, Greg Behrendt -- stand-up comedian, author, TV writer and producer -- had an unusual answer. Greg Behrendt co-wrote ""He's Just Not That Into You,"" based on a popular episode of ""Sex and the City."" ""My instrumental punk and ska band called the Reigning Monarchs,"" he said with a laugh. ""There's seven guys in the band. ... We play shows around Los Angeles."" But the co-author of ""He's Just Not That Into You,"" now a film starring Jennifer Aniston, Scarlett Johansson and Ben Affleck, admits that stand-up comedy remains a longtime passion. In fact, it led -- in a roundabout way -- to ""He's Just Not That Into You."" ""I was a stand-up who had an HBO special called 'Mantastic,' and it was directed by Michael Patrick King, who became an executive producer of 'Sex and the City,' "" Behrendt said. One thing led to another, and Behrendt soon joined a mostly female writing team on ""Sex and the City."" He observed that he was the only straight male writer for the show and offered the group valuable and realistic insight into the world of men. ""Sure, I felt a little bit like a token,"" he said. ""It's not like those women needed my help, but I think there are days when you can't write in a perspective you don't live."" That perspective, along with colleague Liz Tuccillo's female point of view, gave way to ""He's Just Not That Into You."" The book is based on a popular episode of ""Sex and the City,"" in which Carrie's boyfriend (played by Ron Livingston) offers the line to Miranda as she puzzles over a date. The book is a wake-up call for women who obsess and worry about relationships, with an overarching message that if women find themselves doing the chasing, it's likely the guy simply isn't interested. ""We were raised to pursue women. ... Most of the guys I know enjoy the pursuit,"" he said. ""But that doesn't mean women should be wallflowers."" As a comedian-turned-relationship expert -- one who is, by the way, now happily married and writing a book with his wife -- Behrendt said he hoped women would realize their worth when they read the book or watch the film. ""[Women] deserve great things, and they get to decide what their relationships are, and not other people,"" he said. ""You often hear women say, 'I don't know if he's ready to get married.' Why are you waiting for his decision? We always put our fates in other people's hands.""","Greg Behrendt is the co-author of ""He's Just Not That Into You,"" now a film .

"(CNN) -- A crusading Sri Lankan journalist shot dead last week knew he would be killed -- he said so in a dramatic, posthumously published column touching a raw nerve in his war-torn island nation. A candlelight vigil in the Sri Lankan capital in memory of slain journalist Lasantha Wickrematunga. Lasantha Wickrematunga, editor-in-chief of The Sunday Leader, was gunned down execution-style January 8 but spoke from the grave three days later when the newspaper published ""And Then They Came For Me."" That posthumous column anticipated his slaying by government forces and defended the craft of journalism in his country, a profession under fire during its bitter civil war. ""Diplomats, recognizing the risk journalists face in Sri Lanka, have offered me safe passage and the right of residence in their countries. Whatever else I may have been stuck for, I have not been stuck for choice. But there is a calling that is yet above high office, fame, lucre and security. It is the call of conscience,"" Wickrematunga wrote. ""People often ask me why I take such risks and tell me it's a matter of time before I am bumped off."" Wickrematunga wrote that he was twice assaulted and his house was fired upon. ""Despite the government's sanctimonious assurances, there was never a serious police inquiry into the perpetrators of these attacks, and the attackers were never apprehended. ""In all of these cases, I have reason to believe the attacks were inspired by the government. When finally I am killed, it will be the government that kills me,"" he wrote. Sri Lankan President Mahindra Rajapaksa, asked about threats to journalists, voiced assurance that no journalist or media institution had cause to fear any threats or attacks by the government, according to a statement on the government's official Web site.  Watch Sri Lanka's foreign minister discuss press freedom » . ""The government had no interest whatever in seeking disgrace through any attacks on the media,"" he said, and he assured media leaders that the culprits would be captured and brought to justice, the statement said. Hostility against journalists and their institutions has been high as the Sinhalese-dominated government forces work to eradicate the last vestiges of Tamil Tiger separatists in the Jaffna peninsula, the rebel-held northern region. The 25-year-old civil war has left more than 65,000 people dead. Sunanda Deshapriya, spokesman for Sri Lanka's Free Media Movement, said harassment of journalists has been common, and cited these examples from the past year: two journalists killed, another journalist shot at, more than 50 reports of intimidations and threats, 12 media personnel arrested, 16 journalists physically assaulted, one tortured, one assaulted in an abduction attempt, the circulation of a list with 27 journalists targeted for killings, the proposal of a censorship law, and the naming of some journalists as terrorists or terrorist supporters. On January 6, 15 masked gunmen entered Maharajah TV studios outside the capital, Colombo. The journalism watchdog group Committee to Protect Journalists said the attackers shot at and destroyed broadcast equipment, held staff members at gunpoint, and attempted to burn down the station's facilities. CNN on Wednesday interviewed the head of Maharajah TV, Chevaan Daniel, about the incident. Afterward, Sri Lanka's defense secretary, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, called for the arrest of a person who had talked to CNN, Deshapriya said. CPJ said the government-run media has criticized Maharajah TV for its coverage of a suicide bombing in the capital and ""undermining"" a presidential victory speech after government troops took Kilinochchi -- which had been the de facto capital of the Tamil Tigers movement. Government officials have condemned strikes on Colombo and have ordered probes. Bob Dietz, CPJ's Asia program director, said that ""far too often the government or its unofficial allies have been prime suspects behind attacks on journalists and media organizations,"" despite government condemnations and investigations. As the civil warfare first unfolded, Tamil journalists were targeted, Dietz said. But in the past year and a half, mainstream journalists, such as those who raise questions about the government's military activity, have been facing a crackdown -- even if they are from the majority Sinhalese ethnic group or sharply critical of the Tamil rebel movement. This includes Wickrematunga, who questioned the government's successes and value of its military actions. ""That really got under the skin of the government,"" Dietz said. ""It's one thing to insult the president, but another thing to insult the military during wartime."" ""This killing is the worst,"" said Dietz, who compared it to the impact that would be felt if a New York Times or Washington Post columnist were killed in the United States. Wickrematunga's killing spurred a demonstration in Colombo by 4,000 people, which Reporters Without Borders said was the largest since the government of Mahinda Rajapaksa took power three years ago. Another protest was to be held on Thursday in London. The title of Wickrematunga's column was inspired by a poem by a German theologian about how Germans failed to react to Nazism in the past century before it was too late. In his rendition of the poem, Wickrematunga wrote: ""First they came for the Jews and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew. Then they came for the Communists and I did not speak out because I was not a Communist. Then they came for the trade unionists and I did not speak out because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for me and there was no one left to speak out for me."" Wickrematunga pronounces his pride in his profession's attempt to chronicle life in a country at war and his paper's work to bravely represent all people -- ""Sinhalese, Tamil, Muslim, low-caste, homosexual, dissident or disabled."" He casts the paper as an independent organ that faithfully records events. He said the paper lacks a political agenda and wants to see Sri Lanka as a ""transparent, secular, liberal democracy."" ""No other profession calls on its practitioners to lay down their lives for their art save the armed forces and, in Sri Lanka, journalism,"" he wrote, adding that ""countless journalists have been harassed, threatened and killed. It has been my honor to belong to all those categories and now especially the last."" ""I have the satisfaction of knowing that I walked tall and bowed to no man. And I have not traveled this journey alone. Fellow journalists in other branches of the media walked with me: most of them are now dead, imprisoned without trial or exiled in far-off lands."" He also castigates the country's president, who had been a long-time friend. ""In the wake of my death I know you will make all the usual sanctimonious noises and call upon the police to hold a swift and thorough inquiry. But like all the inquiries you have ordered in the past, nothing will come of this one too.""","Lasantha Wickrematunga gunned down execution-style January 8 .

"On CNN's ""State of the Union,"" CNN host and chief national correspondent John King goes outside the Beltway to report on the issues affecting communities across the country. King recently traveled to Arizona, to explore the debate over how to control illegal immigration. A fence separates the United States from Mexico in the U.S. Border Patrol's Yuma Sector in San Luis, Arizona. SAN LUIS, Arizona (CNN)  -- The Yuma desert is below: San Luis, Arizona, to one side and San Luis, Mexico, to the other. On this clear day, the Colorado River is glistening, birds playfully circling over what any map defines as the U.S.-Mexico border in this area. But from a helicopter above, the border is a steel barrier that stands out along the riverbank and against the desert sands, and is the dividing line that gets the most attention from those crying to cross illegally and those who believe recent efforts to bolster U.S. border security have been riddled with wrong choices. Just this past week, eight Democrats in Congress wrote President Obama urging him to halt any further construction of the fence, one of the many border- and immigration-related political debates that have carried over from the Bush administration. To the Border Patrol agents stationed in Yuma Sector, there is no debate. To them, the fence is a success story. From a Vietnam War-vintage Huey helicopter, pilot Chad Smith points across the border to Mexico's Highway 2 and then to the barriers that help stop illegal immigrants from making a sprint into southern Arizona. ""You can see the triple-layer fencing,"" Smith tells us as he lowers the helicopter and hovers over what was once a major crossing point for illegal immigrants and drug smugglers. ""Steel fence right on the border, the pedestrian fence about 90 feet north of that, and then the chain-link fence with the barbed wire."" The fence has three layers in areas where there is an urban neighborhood on the Mexican side. Smith is among those who say their flights are less hectic now because while you can still clearly see the trails in the sand and in some hilly areas below, there is considerably less traffic. ""I've flown before and come back and had 70-plus [illegal immigrants logged in a tracking book],"" Smith said. "" I know guys who have gone on a flight and come back with 100-plus illegals in their logbook. Now it is in single digits, typically."" It is a fascinating view from above: Old trails in some places, and the remnants of newly placed white sandbags in others. ""It forms a pretty good bridge for them to drive across."" Smith says of the sandbags. When they are spotted from above, Border Patrol agents on the ground are called in to destroy the makeshift crossings. Congress in 2006 -- with then-Sen. Barack Obama's support -- authorized nearly $3 billion for 670 miles of fencing stretching from California to Texas. There are more lights, sensors and cameras, and there are also more agents like Mike Lowrie driving patrols and chasing tips called in from colleagues monitoring the camera feeds at the Yuma Sector headquarters. Standing alongside the steel barrier at a point in which there is just one layer of fencing, Lowrie shakes his head when told that some in Washington want to stop additional construction in other areas. ""This used to be a very high-trafficked area, and now it is not,"" Lowrie told us. Asked to define ""high traffic,"" Lowrie says, ""In the Yuma Sector, we would get about 800 a day. Now, 25 maybe, or 10."" Nodding toward the barrier, he continued: ""Numbers don't lie. We didn't have it three years ago, and we were getting massive numbers of illegal entries. We have it now, and we don't."" But there are voices on both extremes of the immigration debate that say the role of the fence is exaggerated, or that say the barrier's benefit in slowing illegal traffic is offset by other costs. Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, whose tough stance against illegal immigrants has earned him global media coverage, says the fence is fine, but: ""We just arrested 150 in the past 14 days. They're still coming."" And Father John Herman, a Roman Catholic priest whose Spanish language Masses are packed with illegal immigrants, blames the fence for more risky crossings in less-populated desert areas. ""We know that the way enforcement has gone has driven many people into the desert and caused more deaths. Needless deaths. If we could only get together and work for comprehensive immigration reform.""","Eight Democrats in Congress wrote Obama to halt building of border fence .

"(CNN) -- A one-of-a-kind bicycle belonging to U.S. cycling legend Lance Armstrong was stolen from a team truck in California just hours after he rode it Saturday on the first day of a nine-day race. Lance Armstrong is racing in the California Amgen Tour as he attempts a comeback after retiring in 2005. Cancer survivor and seven-time Tour de France champion Armstrong is racing in the Amgen Tour of California this week as he continues his latest comeback after retiring from the sport in 2005. Armstrong's first comeback came in 1998, two years after he was diagnosed with advanced testicular cancer that had spread to his lungs and brain. Doctors gave him a less than 50 percent chance of survival. Armstrong announced the bike theft on his Twitter account Sunday morning and posted a photograph. ""There is only one like it in the world therefore hard to pawn it off. Reward being offered,"" the Texan wrote before going out and finishing fifth in Sunday's testing first stage won by Spain's Francisco Mancebo. Swiss Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara, who started the day in the yellow jersey after winning Saturday's time-trial prologue, pulled out midway through the stage feeling unwell. Armstrong improved from 10th to fifth overall, one minute five seconds adrift, with Astana teammate Levi Leipheimer, the two-time defending champion, in second place behind Mancebo. ""Holy hell. That was terrible,"" commented Armstrong who had a puncture. ""Maybe one of the toughest days I've had on a bike, purely based on the conditions. I'm still freezing."" The bicycle that was stolen is not the one that Armstrong rides every day during the race. The stolen bike is used only for time trials, a race in which cyclists ride individually at staggered intervals over a set distance and try to get the best time. The thieves took four bikes from a truck Armstrong's Astana team had parked behind a hotel in Sacramento. The other three bicycles belonged to team members Janez Brajkovic, Steve Morabito and Yaroslav Popovych, Astana said. Armstrong, 37, won the Tour de France, considered the premiere bicycle race in the world, a record seven times from 1999-2005. The 750-mile Amgen Tour of California ends Sunday. It is the second major race in which Armstrong has participated since announcing his comeback in September. He raced last month in the Tour Down Under in Australia, finishing 29th. Armstrong said he is aiming for another Tour de France victory this summer and was not expected to contend in the Australian race, which he used to gauge his fitness level after more than three years out of the saddle.","Lance Armstrong's one-of-a-kind bicycle stolen from team truck in California .

"(CNN) -- A gay rights group is welcoming the likely appointment of the world's first openly gay prime minister, Johanna Sigurdardottir of Iceland. Protesters in Reykjavik celebrate the prime minister's resignation on Monday. Sigurdardottir, the country's 66-year-old minister of social affairs and social security, is on track to succeed Prime Minister Geir Haarde, who resigned Monday following the collapse of the country's main banks, currency and stock market. Negotiations are underway between Sigurardottir's Social Democratic Alliance Party and potential coalition partners. If they succeed, she will become interim prime minister until Iceland next goes to the polls, which must happen by May. ""We really warmly welcome that,"" said Gary Nunn, a spokesperson for Stonewall UK, a British gay-rights group. ""At a time when we've just seen a black man elected to the highest office in America, it gives us hope that we will see an openly gay prime minister here some day."" ""It really does matter. It is helpful"" to have an openly gay prime minister, Nunn said. ""We are trying to foster the ambition that young people can be anything they want to be."" Britain has only one openly lesbian member of Parliament, Angela Eagle of the Labour party, Nunn said. The United States currently has three openly gay members of Congress -- Democratic Reps. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Barney Frank of Massachusetts and Jared Polis of Colorado. Stonewall considers it a higher priority to have significant numbers of openly gay lawmakers than an openly gay prime minister. ""For a head of state of to be gay is great and really encouraging, but it's really important for Parliament to represent the people it serves,"" he said. Sigurdardottir has been a member of Iceland's Parliament for 30 years, and is in her second stint as minister of social affairs. She started her career as a flight attendant for the airline that became IcelandAir. She was active in the flight attendants' labor union during her 11 years with the airline, according to her official resume. Sigurdardottir briefly led her own political party, which merged with other center-left parties to form the Alliance party. She would become Iceland's first female prime minister, although not the North Atlantic nation's first female head of state -- Vigdis Finnbogadottir became its fourth president in 1980. Sigurdardottir lists author and playwright Jonina Leosdottir, 54, as her spouse on her ministry Web site.

"(CNN) -- Twenty-five years after the hit single ""West End Girls,"" can the Pet Shop Boys pull off songs that make you want to dance like it's 1984, but still reflect a social consciousness of 2009? Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe, shown at the BRIT Awards in February, are releasing their 10th studio album. The answer is the title of their latest album: ""Yes."" The British duo will release their 10th studio album on April 21 in the United States through Astralwerks. ""Yes"" has been out in the United Kingdom through Parlophone/EMI since March 23, and entered the Billboard UK albums chart at No. 4. ""We thought that 'Yes' just kind of summed up the theme of the album. It's a positive, upbeat, euphoric pop album,"" keyboardist Chris Lowe said. ""It's almost an answer to the question, 'Is that the Pet Shop Boys?' 'Yes!' "" Given how many different projects the duo has been involved with, it's a valid question. In addition to the studio albums, they've written a musical, ""Closer to Heaven,"" and a soundtrack to Sergei Eisenstein's 1925 silent film classic, ""The Battleship Potemkin."" For ""Yes,"" the Pet Shop Boys worked with Xenomania, a production group known for collaborating with Cher and other pop stars. Xenomania co-wrote three of the tracks on ""Yes"" with Lowe and vocalist Neil Tennant, who write most of their own songs. Watch the official video for ""Love, etc."" on YouTube . The Pet Shop Boys, who recently won an award for outstanding contribution to music at the 2009 BRIT Awards, ""felt very much at home"" at the house outside London, England, that Xenomania has devoted entirely to music, Tennant said. Every bedroom has a studio, and bands hang around downstairs waiting to record amid the sounds of instruments, record mixing and talking. ""You can hear this cacophony of music all day long,"" he said. Like a vinyl record, ""Yes"" is divided into two distinct halves: the happy pop introduction and the more ""weird"" experimental conclusion, Tennant said. The album also features guitar performances by Johnny Marr. ""Love, etc."", the album's first track and currently No. 2 on the Billboard Hot Dance Singles Sales chart, is a social statement about how money, shopping and celebrity don't necessarily bring happiness, while the third track, ""Beautiful People,"" imagines that it must be great to have wealth and fame, Tennant said. ""At the end of the day, it's an old-fashioned sentiment, but love is more important, really,"" Lowe said of ""Love, etc."" ""Pandemonium,"" a love song inspired by the relationship between actress Kate Moss and singer Pete Doherty, was originally written for Kylie Minogue to sing, but she didn't use it, Tennant said. Media reports that they'll never work together again are incorrect, however, he said. ""I think they exaggerated that,"" Tennant said. ""Yeah, so that's not true."" (In a BBC story, Tennant and Lowe said they, like many songwriters, hadn't heard back from Minogue after submitting their material. ""We won't be doing it again,"" Lowe told the BBC.) Perhaps the most out-of-character song stylistically is the finale, ""Legacy,"" a meditation on politicians leaving office (""You'll get over it"" is the main message). Tennant identified it as his favorite because of the poetry and the mystery in the music -- ""it continues to fascinate me,"" he said. ""The Way It Used to Be,"" a favorite track for both Boys, charts a relationship from its romantic beginning to its melancholic end, wondering ""what is left of love"" and longing to ""leave our promises behind / rewind and try again."" With all this talk of love, Tennant is private about his own love life. As far as love in the album goes, though, ""Some of it's real, and some imagination; some of it's memory,"" he said. The duo did not meet in a pet shop, but in an an electronics shop in London in 1981. Tennant needed a piece of equipment for his synthesizer and, when he and Lowe started talking about music, the two hit it off. ""I'm always struck since then by the sort of amazing look of our meeting,"" Tennant said. ""We happened to be in the same place at the same time, and it changed the rest of our lives. I always think it was an extraordinary thing."" They started making music as a hobby with an acoustic guitar and a synthesizer, and played drums by banging on the table, Lowe said. ""It's all been a gradual process really. We never sat down really and said, 'Let's become pop stars,' "" Lowe said. When they first recorded ""West End Girls"" together, the musical group did not have a name, Tennant said. They took the name Pet Shop Boys because they had friends who worked at a pet shop in West London known as the ""pet shop boys."" They thought the name fit with popular rap groups such as the Beastie Boys. ""It has actually no meaning whatsoever. Chris used to be embarrassed by it,"" Tennant said. While influenced by hip-hop, electronic disco, and other genres from the beginning, the Pet Shop Boys have always emphasized the songs themselves, Lowe said, and they're not ""purist"" about what kinds of instruments get used. In the beginning, they sampled everything from animal noises to broken glass for their songs. They even recorded the sound of a woman walking down a street in high heels for ""West End Girls,"" and the ambience of a cathedral for the 1987 single ""It's a Sin,"" Lowe said. Their songwriting has perhaps gotten more sophisticated and experimental over time, Tennant said. ""In the '80s I never sang any harmonies on records. Now I do loads of harmonies. I'm turning into Brian Wilson!"" Tennant said. ""Yes"" continues the Pet Shop Boys' tradition of having one-word titles for albums, such as ""Please,"" ""Bilingual,"" and the more recent ""Fundamental."" The convention  just developed and became a style that the duo decided to keep, Tennant said. ""It's like e.e. cummings not having any capital letters -- it's a signature thing,"" Tennant said. The duo is determined to branch into new areas. Lowe and Tennant's next project is a ballet slated for 2011 based on a story by Hans Christian Anderson. Tennant said it is instrumental, and includes a mixture of electronic music and strings. ""The challenge of telling a story through music and dance is something that we're interested in,"" Lowe said. Plans to tour the United States in the fall are under discussion, the duo said.","The Pet Shop Boys' new album comes out in the United States on April 21 .

"(CNN) -- A Singapore lawmaker was in intensive care Monday after a man set him on fire at a community event, a hospital official told CNN. Seng Han Thong of the ruling People's Action Party underwent skin graft surgery at Singapore General Hospital Monday morning and was in stable condition, said hospital spokeswoman Junaidah Hameed. Seng suffered burns to his face and chest after a man in his 70s came up behind him as he was sitting down for lunch, poured thinner on him and set him on fire, party official George Tan told reporters. An event organizer who rushed to Seng's aid and tried to douse the flames was also injured, the hospital said. Seng had gone to the community center in his parliamentary district to hand out money to residents -- a tradition among many politicians ahead of the Chinese New Year, which falls on January 26 this year. The attacker was a 70-year-old former cab driver who has been in and out of a mental clinic in recent months, the English-language daily newspaper the Straits Times reported. Tan, the party official, said the man had met Seng at several meet-and-greets and complained about ""evil spirits in his house."" ""No matter what the reason is, and whatever condition the person is in, that is no reason to commit such a crime against anyone, not just against an MP [member of parliament],"" Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng told reporters at the hospital. Two years ago, Seng was attacked at another community event by another cab driver, the newspaper said. In that incident, the cab driver punched Seng because he was upset that the lawmaker was not helping him get his revoked license reinstated. CNN's Saeed Ahmed contributed to this report.","Man in his 70s poured thinner on lawmaker and set him on fire while he had lunch .

"SEATTLE, Washington (CNN) -- The park bench facing Lake Washington is covered with flowers, poems, a pack of Lucky Strike cigarettes and graffiti. Fans leave flowers and mementos in honor of Kurt Cobain near his Seattle home. ""I miss your beautiful face and voice,"" one dedication reads. ""Thank you for inspiring me,"" says another. ""RIP Kurt."" Fifteen years ago Wednesday, at a house adjacent to the park, Kurt Cobain's dead body was discovered by an electrician. The Nirvana frontman, 27, had committed suicide, police later ruled, killing himself with a shotgun while high on heroin and pills. His death ended a battle with hard drugs and added Cobain to a long list of legendary musicians, such as Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin, whose careers were cut short by their addictions. Cobain's ashes were reportedly scattered in a Washington state river and a New York Buddhist temple. Nirvana band mates Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl eventually formed other bands. Cobain's widow, Courtney Love, stayed in the limelight with an acting career and legal problems surrounding her own drug problems. Frances Bean, the couple's daughter, has largely lived outside the public eye. What was unclear when Cobain died was whether the music Nirvana created would endure or fade away like the grunge craze it helped to inspire. ""At one point I thought, 15 years on, no one would really know who Kurt Cobain was outside of a group of diehard fans,"" said Jeff Burlingame, a Cobain biographer who grew up with the musician in Aberdeen, Washington, and knew him when he was a teenager who, without a place to sleep, crashed on mutual friends' couches. But Nirvana's music endured, and Cobain even found fans in his hometown of Aberdeen, which he had derided as a small-minded town. ""The old-timers who were there when Kurt was around really took offense to some of the things he said about the area, so they had no real reason to honor him,"" said Burlingame, who co-founded the Kurt Cobain Memorial Committee. A famous son is a famous son, though. Now, visitors arriving in Aberdeen are greeted with a sign that reads ""Come As You Are,"" after a famous Nirvana song. Cobain Memorial Committee members, who include Cobain's paternal grandfather, hope to establish a community center in the late rocker's honor that would give area youth a place to play music and pursue artistic interests. A concert will be held Friday in Seattle to honor Cobain and raise money for the center. When Cobain died, he left behind a fortune that was estimated in the millions. Even more money poured in over time from the royalties from his songs. But a lawyer hired by Love, Rhonda Holmes, says most of that money is missing. According to Holmes, Love recently discovered that ""managers, assistants, CPAs, lawyers, people like that who were supposed to be entrusted with carrying for their well-being and finances basically looted the estate."" Forensic accountants are now trying to determine where tens of millions of dollars from Cobain's estate ended up and how it could be recovered, Holmes said.","Kurt Cobain died 15 years ago, a suicide at 27 .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Five U.S. soldiers were killed Friday in a suicide bombing in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul -- the single deadliest attack on U.S. troops in more than a year, the U.S. military said. A suicide truck bomber breached the outer security barrier of Iraqi National Police headquarters in southern Mosul, and detonated his explosives, killing eight people and wounding 60 others, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said. A U.S. soldier was also among the wounded, the U.S. military said. The ministry said those killed include five Americans, two Iraqi policemen and an Iraqi soldier. At least two individuals suspected of being involved in the attack were detained, the U.S. military said. It is the deadliest attack on U.S. forces since March 10, 2008, when five U.S. soldiers were killed in a suicide attack in Baghdad. Despite a number of military operations in this volatile city during the past year, Mosul remains one of the most violent places in Iraq. Last year the U.S. military said Mosul was the last urban stronghold of al Qaeda in Iraq. Mosul is the provincial capital of Nineveh and is about 260 miles, or 420 kilometers, north of Baghdad.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A form of liquid morphine used by terminally ill patients will remain on the market even though it is an ""unapproved drug,"" according to a decision by the Food and Drug Administration. Last month, the FDA warned nine companies to stop selling unapproved pain-relief drugs. After talking with hospital and hospice organizations, which expressed concern that taking the product off the market would result in hardship for terminally ill patients and their caregivers, the agency decided to extend the usage of morphine sulfate oral solution 20 mg/ml. The agency wants to ensure there is no shortage of the drug while patients wait for an approved product to take its place. ""While the FDA remains committed to ultimately ensuring that all prescription drugs on the market are FDA approved, we have to balance that goal with flexibility and compassion for patients who have a few alternatives for the alleviation of their pain,"" Dr. Douglas Throckmorton, deputy director of the FDA's Center for drug Evaluation and Research, said Thursday. ""In light of the concerns raised by these patients and their health-care providers, we have adjusted our actions with regard to these particular products."" Last month, the FDA sent warning letters to nine companies telling them to stop manufacturing 14 unapproved narcotics that are widely used to treat pain. Seven of those companies made or distributed the oral morphine. The morphine elixir is widely used by terminal patients in hospital and home hospice care settings and is manufactured by Lehigh Valley Technologies Inc., Mallinckrodt Inc. Pharmaceuticals Group, Boehringer Ingelheim Roxane Inc. and Cody Laboratories, Inc. In its warning letter last month, the agency gave the companies 60 days to stop manufacturing the drug before enforcement action was taken. Thursday's announcement did not prompt immediate reactions from the companies. A spokesman for Cody Laboratories said the firm did not have all the details of the decision. Other companies did not immediately return calls from CNN. The FDA estimates there are several thousand drugs, mostly older products, marketed illegally without FDA approval in this country. Once an illegally marketed drug is identified, enforcement action begins because the agency does not have information on the quality of these drugs and has not had an opportunity to approve their labeling. In 1976 the agency began a program to bring companies manufacturing these drugs into compliance. Thursday's announcement applies only to the morphine sulfate elixir 20mg/ml, and the warning letters sent to the other product manufacturers are still in effect. Currently there are no approved morphine sulfate oral solution 20mg/ml products on the market. Until there are, the FDA says it will allow companies making and distributing the unapproved drugs to continue, until 180 days after any company receives approval to manufacture a new morphine replacement drug of the same dosage. The FDA says it expects all companies marketing unapproved drugs to submit the necessary applications to get approval for those drugs.","FDA decides to extend the usage of morphine sulfate oral solution 20 mg/ml .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- In a dramatic break from previous policy, the United States will join direct talks between U.N. and European powers and Iran over Tehran's nuclear program, the State Department announced Wednesday. Wednesday's announcement is the latest step by the Obama administration to engage Iran diplomatically. The Obama administration has asked the European Union's international policy chief, Javier Solana, to invite Iran to new talks with the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany, State Department spokesman Robert Wood said. ""If Iran accepts, we hope this will be an occasion to seriously engage Iran of how to break the logjam of recent years and work in a cooperative manner to resolve the outstanding international concerns about its nuclear program,"" Wood said. Iran so far has refused Security Council demands to halt its production of enriched uranium, which it has said will be used to fuel nuclear power plants. The United States has accused Tehran of concealing efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, and the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog agency said it has failed to resolve questions about the aim of Iranian program.  Watch how U.S. policy on Iran is changing » . The Bush administration had insisted that Iran first stop its nuclear program before any talks with the United States or its allies could go forward. Wednesday's announcement is the latest step in the Obama administration's efforts to engage the Islamic republic diplomatically after nearly three decades without formal ties. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, briefly addressing the administration's decision Wednesday, told reporters that ""pursuing very careful engagement on a range of issues that affect our interests and the interests of the world with Iran makes sense."" ""And there's nothing more important than trying to convince Iran to cease its efforts to obtain a nuclear weapon,"" Clinton said at the State Department, where she was meeting Panama's foreign affairs minister. Her comments came in response to a reporter's question about engaging Iran. Washington, which has not had diplomatic relations with Iran since 1980, has participated in previous talks only as an observer. Wood would not speculate about whether a meeting involving Iran and the rest of the group might lead to direct one-on-one meetings of U.S. and Iranian officials. ""It's a little early to talk about that right now,"" he said. Iran has so far responded coolly to the American overtures. In a statement carried on Iranian state television Wednesday evening, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Washington ""has no right to suggest how other nations should live."" ""Those who have nuclear bombs are backward nations, because the time for threats is over,"" Ahmadinejad said. And in a statement carried by the official IRNA news agency, Ahmadinejad said Iran was ""ready to cooperate"" toward nuclear disarmament, as long as those efforts did not create obstacles for countries that wish to produce nuclear fuel for civilian power. No date has been set for the next meeting of the ""P-5 plus 1"" group, which includes the five Security Council permanent members -- the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China -- as well as Germany. But Wednesday's announcement comes amidst a variety of signals from both sides that a major diplomatic shift was in the winds. In March, President Obama delivered a televised message to the Iranian people offering new diplomatic engagement. And Clinton sat down with an Iranian official at a recent conference in the Netherlands on Afghanistan, but the two diplomats had no one-on-one contact. During his presidential campaign, Obama called for talks with Iran without pre-conditions -- a proposal sharply criticized by Clinton, then his chief opponent for the Democratic nomination, among others. Big obstacles to a U.S.-Iranian thaw remain, including reports from Tehran on Wednesday that Iranian authorities have charged an American journalist with espionage. Clinton told reporters that the the U.S. had asked the Swiss -- who represent U.S. interests in Iran -- for up-to-date information about Roxana Saberi, who has been jailed for nearly three months. During the March 31 meeting in the Netherlands, the United States delivered a note to Iran that asked for a response on the status of Saberi and American citizens detained or missing in Iran. U.S. officials say they are still awaiting a response from the Iranians to the note.

"(CNN)  -- A Texas couple who were burned to death in the Texas wildfires Thursday had been packing their truck to evacuate their home but were unable to escape fast-moving flames, a relative told CNN Friday. A house burns after wildfires raced through rural Montague County in Texas. ""I think they underestimated how fast it was moving,"" said Carol Quinn, the daughter-in-law of victim Matt Quinn. ""I think this was very fast and very hot. ... It is an awful story."" Matt Quinn, 80, and his wife, Cathy, were two of the three confirmed fatalities in Thursday's fires. Matt Quinn was a former reporter for the Dallas-Fort Worth station WFAA-TV and had spent his life in journalism. The Quinns lived in rural Montague County. The couple's son Chris, 30, was hospitalized in fair condition with second- and third-degree burns and was expected to recover, Carol Quinn said. Chris had gone to look for his cat as the family prepared to leave in advance of the fires. ""There were three of them. Chris went to get his cat and put the cat in the carrier,"" Carol Quinn, who lives in Orlando, Florida, told CNN. ""When he came back, the truck was totally engulfed in flames. ""The flames were closing in, and he didn't know if Matt and Cathy were in the truck, and he took off running."" The family did not live in a mandatory evacuation area but faced gusty winds and a wall of flames 30 feet high, she said. She said they had called the sheriff's department shortly before their truck was engulfed. Another person was killed just west of Dallas and Fort Worth in what's being called the Cement Mountain fire, the Texas Fire Service reported Friday afternoon. Wildfires are also burning in Oklahoma. In Midwest City, one of the places hit hardest by the flames, fire officials said at least one of the fires appears to have been intentionally set -- although they stopped short of calling it arson.  See where the fires are burning » . ""We'd like to make the distinction and understand that there's a difference between being intentional and having intent with malice,"" said city Fire Marshal Jerry Lojka. ""So we haven't proved that there was malice, but we do know that the fire was intentionally set."" Winds that at times reached hurricane-force levels blew through towns and neighborhoods, fueling fires that burned some homes while sparing others.  Watch what is left of homes -- rubble » . More than 101,000 acres in Texas were burned, destroying 32 buildings, according to Bill Beebee of the Texas Forest Service. About 140 structures in Oklahoma have been destroyed, most of them in south-central Oklahoma and Oklahoma County, according to the Department of Emergency Management. At least 49 people were injured. Health officials said that with two exceptions, injuries from the fires were moderate or minor. A motorist was severely injured after losing control of a vehicle on a smoky road. Also, a Lincoln County firefighter was in stable condition at the Integris Baptist Burn Center in Oklahoma City. The fires burned all the way into Oklahoma City, and by Friday afternoon, firefighters were once again battling blazes that had flared up again within the city limits. iReport.com: Are wildfires affecting you? Oklahoma Gov. Brad Henry declared a state of emergency for 31 counties. The state also was hit with severe weather. Henry's order marks a first step toward seeking federal assistance, if necessary, by allowing state agencies to make emergency purchases. ""We are doing everything we can to deliver resources to firefighters and first responders on the front lines. They have done an amazing job under very challenging conditions, and we owe them a great debt of gratitude. Their heroism has helped save lives and property,"" Henry said in a written statement. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the scores of families and individuals who lost homes or businesses,"" he said. Midwest City and the nearby towns of Choctaw and Nicoma Park were especially hard hit. By late Friday afternoon, the fires were under control and firefighters were putting out hot spots, the governor said.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- For Miley Cyrus, star of Disney's popular television series ""Hannah Montana"" and its big-screen adaptation ""Hannah Montana: The Movie,"" art is not far from real life. Miley Cyrus, here in ""Hannah Montana: The Movie,"" says filming in Tennessee was relaxing. The 16-year-old actress and singer reconnected with her Southern roots for the filming of ""Hannah Montana: The Movie.""

"TEL AVIV, Israel (CNN) -- In Tel Aviv's wholesale fashion headquarters, where textile merchants follow in the legacy of fathers and grandfathers, many Israelis are looking for the latest in tech fashion: the iPhone. Mobile phone store Z-Tov Ltd. in Tel Aviv carries iPhones among other cell phones and products. It's at Z-Tov Ltd. that consumers shop for the latest models of Samsung, Philips and Motorola. The local mobile phone chain even carries the 8GB and 16GB models of the highly coveted iPhone. One customer asks the clerk whether the store sells the 16GB iPhone. But when he hears the price, the customer walks off in disappointment. Z-Tov sells the 8GB iPhone for about 2,600 NIS, or about U.S. $753. The current market price in the United States is $399. The store clerk says the store pays a 50 percent tax to import iPhones from outside the country. But the price doesn't hinder iPhone's popularity here, appealing mostly to young men quick to upgrade their 8GB to a 16GB model as if memory size is a barometer of male bravado. Apple has yet to make its presence official in Israel. The company has limited its iPhone products to four markets: the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and France. Still, as in other parts of the world, the iPhone has strong reception along Mediterranean shores. The coveted phones make their way through customs in both official and unofficial passages; consumers buy them abroad for friends and acquaintances to resell on the gray market. But before the phone can work on a local network, it must be unlocked or ""jailbroken,"" tech lingo for reprogramming the iPhone to work on network carriers not affiliated with Apple. Apple maintains strategic deals with several hand-picked wireless carriers; namely AT&T in the United States. In order to protect these alliances, Apple issues this disclaimer to customers planning to reprogram the iPhone: Unlock at your own risk. The standard one-year warranty on jailbroken iPhones is null and void. At Z-Tov, unlocking the iPhone is big business, and Arik Steinman's services are in high demand. For 100 NIS (about U.S. $30), Steinman, a Russian immigrant, will unlock an iPhone in about 20 minutes, replacing the factory-provided SIM card with the customer's SIM of choice. For an extra 50 NIS (about U.S. $15), he'll change the language program to Hebrew. Steinman, who maintains a growing collection of unused AT&T SIM cards, said he unlocks an average of 30 to 40 iPhones a week. Steinman has no formal technical background; he said he learned the technique through various sources. ""In the beginning, it wasn't simple; now it is simple,"" he said with a smirk. Last year, as many as 1 million iPhones may have been unlocked and activated by carriers not paying Apple a kickback, according to industry experts. Anosh Ishak, a businessman and developer based in Atlanta, Georgia, said his iPhone is a ""valuable business tool"" that he uses on international trips, notably to Israel, where he'll pop out his U.S. SIM and replace it with one that will run on a local network. Ishak said he paid $20 to a friend of a friend to unlock his phone so he can stay with his current phone carrier, T-Mobile. When he purchased the iPhone from an Apple retail store in Atlanta, he made it clear he wasn't planning to sign on with AT&T. ""They told me that they wouldn't sell me the phone if they knew I was going to unlock it,"" Ishak said. Determined, Ishak told the salesperson that he had the right to buy the merchandise and that the store could not control it. How did the Apple salesperson respond? ""To tell me he'll pretend like he didn't hear it,"" said Ishak. Apple representatives declined to comment on the unlocking phenomenon and iPhones making their way overseas, referring CNN to a Wired article that quoted Apple Chief Operating Officer Tim Cook speaking at the Goldman Sachs Technology Symposium in February. Cook described the unlocked iPhones floating around the world as ""a good problem to have,"" according to Wired, preferring to focus on Apple's 10 million quota -- even if it means doing away with its carrier exclusivity. ""The demand for the iPhone is so intense in the markets where we aren't offering it that people are exporting it out of the U.S. in many different ways and then running it on local carriers,"" Cook said. ""Of all the problems we face, this is the one I face looking at with a little bit of a smile. Because it means there's great demand for the phone. And to have people stepping over each other to have the phone isn't a bad thing,"" Cook said.","Z-Tov sells the 8GB iPhone for about 2,000 NIS, or about U.S. $790 .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Secretary of State-designate Hillary Clinton had $6.4 million in presidential campaign debt at the end of November, according to a report filed Saturday with the Federal Election Commission. Hillary Clinton says she hopes to have her campaign debt paid before her possible confirmation as secretary of state. The amount, though still significant, represents the lowest level of debt the New York senator's failed presidential campaign has reported this year. Clinton's campaign debt reached its peak, $12 million, at the end of June and has gradually fallen since then. Clinton said she hopes to pay off her debt before her possible confirmation as secretary of state. Clinton has also officially forgiven the $13.2 million she personally loaned her campaign. Under the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law, presidential candidates who loan their campaigns money from personal funds may only be paid back if they do so by the national party convention -- in this case, the Democratic National Convention held last August in Denver. Clinton began November with $985,000 in her campaign account and raised nearly $290,000 by the end of the month. Her campaign paid out $1.2 million, mainly to unpaid vendors, ending the month with $188,000 in the bank. The $6.4 million in remaining debt is owed to a total of 16 creditors. The largest unpaid amount is owed to Penn, Schoen & Berland, a political consulting and polling firm that advised Clinton during her presidential bid. The firm's president, Mark Penn, served as chief strategist to Clinton for most of her campaign until he was forced out of his position in April after revelations that he lobbied for a U.S.-Colombia trade deal on behalf of the Colombian government despite Clinton's opposition to the measure. However, he never left the campaign entirely.","Hillary Clinton still owes more than $6 million in presidential campaign debt .

"Editor's note: Mike Galanos hosts ""Prime News"" from 5-7 p.m. ET Mondays through Fridays on HLN. ""Prime News"" uses the day's most powerful headlines as a starting point for diverse perspectives, spirited debate and your points of view. Mike Galanos says child pornography charges are too harsh for teens caught ""sexting."" ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- ""Sexting."" Have parents out there ever even heard of this term? Whether you want to admit it or not, teenagers are sending sexual messages and naked pictures of themselves to their boyfriends and girlfriends. In most cases it's the girl sending a picture or message to the guy. If you're thinking to yourself right now, ""What's the big deal?"" then you should think again. This practice can ruin our teenagers' lives. Six teens in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, were charged as juveniles with possessing child pornography after three girls sent nude or semi-nude pictures of themselves to three boys. It gets even worse. A 13-year-old boy in Middletown, Ohio, is facing felony pandering obscenities charges after taping a sex act and showing it to friends at a skating party. A felony? Yes this kid needs to be punished but we don't need our 13 or 14-year-olds charged with child porn and lumped in with adult pedophiles and labeled as sex offenders. I've spoken with several attorneys on our show and it seems there is no one reason prosecutors are opting to charge teens with child porn instead of lesser charges. Some may be doing it to ""send a message."" Some may feel they have an obligation to charge these teens with the most serious offense possible and, according to the law, naked pictures of underage kids are usually considered child porn. And others may feel they are left with no options since there aren't really any laws that apply specifically to sexting. In any case, it's clear we need to change our laws to catch up with technology. A great illustration of why change is needed now is the story of Phillip Alpert, of Orlando, Florida. He didn't ask, but his girlfriend sexted him naked pictures of herself, according to the Orlando Sentinel. When they broke up, he mass e-mailed the photos to get back at her. Alpert, 18, was convicted of transmission of child porn and he will carry the label of ""sex offender"" until he is 43. He lost friends, was kicked out of school, he can't even move in with his dad because his dad lives near a school. Should Phillip be punished? Yes. Should the six teens in Pennsylvania face consequences? Yes. But let's kick them off cheerleading squads and sports teams. Make them do community service and take classes on sex crimes. Educate other teens on the dangers of sexting. Pay a price, yes, but these young people shouldn't pay for this for the rest of their lives. And if you think this couldn't happen to your kid, think again. Sexting is more prevalent than you think. The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy teamed up with CosmoGirl.com and asked over 1,200 teens about their sexual behaviors in cyberspace. According to their study, 39 percent of teens (that's ages 13-19) are sending or posting sexually suggestive messages over IM, text or e-mail and around the same number of teens are receiving such messages. Half of those teens, 20 percent, are sending or posting nude or semi-nude pictures of themselves. That's frightening. Why are our kids doing this? On our show, psychotherapist Stacy Kaiser said, ""What I'm finding is a lot of girls are doing this because they're hoping it will help them get or keep a boyfriend."" The numbers agree with Stacy. According to the study, 51 percent of girls say it's ""pressure from guys"" that's making them send sexual messages and pictures of themselves. So guys are expecting this and our girls are saying ""OK."" It makes me wonder how much progress we've really made in how young women are viewed and treated. The bottom line: We need to educate, not incarcerate, our teens and it has to start with parents. Don't let the culture indoctrinate your little boy or girl about sex before their time. So strike first as a parent. If your kids are older, let them know a digital record is for life. When little Suzie tries to win the affection of little Bobby by sexting him a picture, she is putting her future at stake. There is no control over that image or video once it gets out. But that doesn't mean little Suzie should be charged as a child pornographer.

"(CNN) -- Voters in Nashville, Tennessee -- a city that has seen a dramatic increase in its immigrant population -- rejected a measure Thursday that would have made English the only language used for government business in its metropolitan area. Nearly 57 percent of those who cast ballots Thursday in Nashville, Tennessee, voted against the measure. With all 173 precincts reporting, 41,752 voters, or nearly 57 percent, voted against the proposed amendment, with 32,144 voters supporting it, according to unofficial results posted on the Nashville city government Web site. ""No person shall have a right to government services in any other language,"" the proposal read. The measure would have included government meetings. The Metropolitan Council, which submitted the measure, could have mandated exceptions to protect public health and safety. Elise Shore, southeast director of the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said her regional office in Atlanta, Georgia, was monitoring the Nashville balloting. ""We just elected our first black president. There are the forces of globalization and conducting business around the world ... in the face of this, we see these measures?"" Shore asked. The proposal ""sends a strong message ... this is a negative message. In fact, it invites discrimination,"" she said. In a newspaper editorial published Thursday, The Tennessean urged voters to defeat the proposal. ""This amendment would exclude and marginalize those residents and visitors to Nashville simply because English is not their native tongue,"" the editorial said. The polls opened at 7 a.m. and closed at 7 p.m. Before the measure was defeated, a spokesman for U.S. English Inc., an action group that supports English-only laws nationwide, said the Nashville proposal was a good one. ""Government programs are aimed at helping people reach self-sufficiency and success,"" Rob Toonkel said. ""Allowing use of a second language doesn't encourage them to learn English."" ""The key word [of the amendment] is 'actions that bind the government,' "" Toonkel said, which would cover transactions such as getting a city contract. If a non-English speaker needs help filling out a form, and someone in that agency speaks their language, they should be helped, he said. ""But you shouldn't be able to come in, pick up a form [in another language] and leave."" According to Toonkel, about 30 states and more than 100 localities have made English their official language, and he said his organization believes such laws are legal. Raul Gonzalez, legislative director for the National Council of La Raza, said the message of the proposal is discriminatory. ""What it ... says is, 'If you speak a language other than English, you may not be welcome here,' "" Gonzalez said. La Raza is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization focused on reducing poverty and discrimination and improving opportunities for Hispanic Americans. Gonzalez said similar English-only laws across the country ""have so many exceptions they are meaningless."" In an editorial earlier this month, The Tennessean quoted the referendum's sponsor, Councilman Eric Crafton, who said the bill was needed to save the city $100,000 to $150,000 in annual translation and related costs. However, metro officials told the newspaper such services are provided by employees already on the city's payroll. The council passed a similar bill in 2007, but it was vetoed by then-Mayor Bill Purcell, who called it ""unconstitutional, unnecessary and mean-spirited,"" according to The Tennessean. U.S. Census data from 2000 showed an increase of 210 percent in the immigrant population of the Nashville metro area, including Davidson County, since 1990. During that decade, immigrants accounted for 45 percent of the overall population increase in the city. More than two-thirds, or 67 percent, of the area's foreign-born population had entered since 1990. This was much higher than the rate for the state overall, which was about 58 percent. The Census Bureau's American Community Survey, taken between 2005 and 2007 for the Nashville metro area, shows a population of 613,632. Of that number, 61,843 were foreign-born, with most of the immigrants coming from Latin America. About 73,000 residents speak a language other than English at home and, of those, 35,290 speak English less than ""very well,"" the survey found.","NEW: 57 percent vote against English-only measure in Nashville, Tennessee .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- On Inauguration Day, there's one scene at the White House that won't be playing out exactly as it has during past transitions: the traditional moving of the outgoing first family's belongings. President Bush walks out of the White House Oval Office on January 10. Anita McBride, chief of staff to first lady Laura Bush, tells CNN that the Bushes have moved almost all of their belongings out of the White House ahead of schedule. ""There won't be ... the moving trucks for the Bushes coming here,"" McBride said, adding, ""The only things really left for President and Mrs. Bush are their personal belongings and luggage that they'll take that day."" McBride said Mrs. Bush directed residence staff early -- in the summer of 2008 -- to prepare the White House for the personal transition. ""It's probably the librarian in her,"" McBride said of Mrs. Bush, a former librarian. ""Maybe we've got a bit of a Dewey Decimal system of move-out process, but that certainly made it easier for the residence staff, and they very much appreciate it,"" McBride said. The actual clearing out of the Bushes' belongings began over the summer, McBride says, when many items were packed and taken to Crawford, Texas. Then, during the Christmas holiday, the Bushes moved their personal things out of Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, according to McBride. That means on Inauguration Day, while President Bush and Mrs. Bush, along with President-elect Obama and his family, are at the Capitol, staff in the White House residence will have more time to unpack and prepare the Obamas' personal belongings. ""They have rehearsed this over the last few weeks, everyone has their marching orders, it will be all hands on deck,"" said McBride. ""The residence staff will be here that morning, and they know what their jobs are when the moving truck for the Obamas' move-in arrives,"" she said, adding, ""Their things will be unpacked, and their clothes will be in their rightful place, and whatever furniture that they may have selected from the White House furniture collection will be in the place that they want it to be.""","The Obamas' belongings will be moved into the White House on Tuesday .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The international race among sailors, kite surfers and wind surfers to be the fastest wind-powered boat on the planet is rapidly gaining momentum as speeds reach all-time highs. Quick sailor: French trimaran l'Hydroptere is one of the boats battling for the outright world sailing speed record. The outright world sailing speed record -- which did not change hands for 11 years after 1993 -- has been bettered four times this year alone. The new holder of the record, Alexandre Caizergues, of France, claimed it with an average speed of 50.57 knots (almost 60 miles per hour) over 500 meters on his kite board off the coast of Namibia last month. Caizergues' attempt was eventually ratified by the World Sailing Speed Record Council (WSSRC) this month, when it was decided that kite boards would be eligible for the outright record. Meanwhile, another Frenchman, Alain Thebault, has also been closely challenging for the record on his vessel l'Hydroptere. Thebault's crew hold the 500m speed record in the boat class, and also have the overall speed record in the one nautical mile category. Then there is the Australian sailor hoping to spoil the party for the French . Paul Larsen, aboard British yacht Vestas SailRocket, has unofficially nabbed the fastest boat record from l'Hydroptere with an average speed of 47.4 knots. Larsen achieved the speed in 22 knot winds, and shortly before his unusual ""boat"" became airborne and flipped. Larsen's speed is just awaiting formal approval from the WSSRC. Thebault held the record with a speed of 46.88 knots. Even the round-the-world Volvo Ocean Race has had a speed record of its own with current leader Ericsson 4 claiming the world record for the most distance sailed in a 24-hour period during the event's first leg. According to a spokesman from the WSSRC, interest in speed sailing is steadily building, and the close competition has been giving it a boost. ""Certainly towards the end of the year it's been very hectic. I think what has happened is that a number of competitors have been at the top end and they have all been competing against each other at the same venues. The development of new technologies is one factor that has increased interest in trying to break these records. ""The fact that kite boards have developed has helped ... but there is still a lot of people out there that want to achieve these records,"" the spokesman said. He said that a lot of syndicates had been involved in speed sailing for some time, and that many were only now starting to feel the benefits of their developmental work. ""It does seem if you are going for a specially designed boat it takes a few years before you get the design right,"" he said. The spokesman said the WSSRC had received about 50 formal applications for speed attempts during 2008. He said the council's job was not to promote the attempts but simply to oversee them in a fair and independent manner and ratify successful efforts. The WSSRC had a number of commissioners based around the world, he said.","Kite boarder Alexandre Caizergues, of France, holds the world sailing speed record .

"BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN) -- Demonstrators stormed a hotel Saturday where Asian leaders were to meet, forcing the indefinite postponement of the Association of South East Asian Nations summit. Thousands of anti-government protesters block a busy intersection during rush hour in Bangkok. Participating Asian leaders were on their way out of the country, according to Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva. He declared a state of emergency in Chonburi province and the southern coastal city of Pattaya, where the summit was to be held, but rescinded the order hours afterward. Thousands of ""red shirt"" protesters, named for the color of their attire, have rallied for days to demand Abhisit's resignation. The demonstrators flooded into the summit site after smashing through the hotel's glass doors, but were otherwise nonviolent. Hundreds of them streamed in, without police interference. Protesters hugged the officers and shook their hands. The red shirts have given the prime minister repeated deadlines to resign, but those have come and gone. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon he was disappointed by the summit's delay. ""I understand the circumstances that led the Thai government to take this difficult decision. While I had hoped to have exchanges with the leaders of ASEAN and its dialogue partners, I continue to look forward to engaging again with them in the near future,"" Ban said. ""I strongly value the long-standing relationship between ASEAN and the United Nations, and their cooperation in various fields. I hope for an early restoration of normalcy in Thailand and for the settlement of differences through dialogue and peaceful means,"" he added. The protesters are loyal to former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a 2006 coup. Thaksin now lives outside of Thailand. The protesters have said Abhisit's government was not democratically elected and want him to resign and schedule elections. Abhisit, who has held the position for four months, has rejected calls for him to step down. Lawmakers named the 44-year-old, Oxford University-educated Abhisit prime minister in December in the wake of months of demonstrations against Thaksin and his ruling party, People Power Party. On Tuesday, protesters rushed Abhisit's motorcade while it was struck in traffic. He escaped unharmed. Protesters opposed to Thaksin took to the streets last year wearing yellow shirts, occupied the Government House and blockaded Bangkok's major international airport, stranding throngs of tourists who provide much of the country's revenue. The demonstrations ended in early December when a court ruled that the People Power Party was guilty of electoral fraud and threw Thaksin's brother-in-law out of the prime minister's seat. The red shirt protesters said this week they would not take over the airports. Dan Rivers and Kocha Olarn contributed to this report.","Demonstrators storm a hotel Saturday where Asian leaders were to meet .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A form of liquid morphine used by terminally ill patients will remain on the market even though it is an ""unapproved drug,"" according to a decision by the Food and Drug Administration. Last month, the FDA warned nine companies to stop selling unapproved pain-relief drugs. After talking with hospital and hospice organizations, which expressed concern that taking the product off the market would result in hardship for terminally ill patients and their caregivers, the agency decided to extend the usage of morphine sulfate oral solution 20 mg/ml. The agency wants to ensure there is no shortage of the drug while patients wait for an approved product to take its place. ""While the FDA remains committed to ultimately ensuring that all prescription drugs on the market are FDA approved, we have to balance that goal with flexibility and compassion for patients who have a few alternatives for the alleviation of their pain,"" Dr. Douglas Throckmorton, deputy director of the FDA's Center for drug Evaluation and Research, said Thursday. ""In light of the concerns raised by these patients and their health-care providers, we have adjusted our actions with regard to these particular products."" Last month, the FDA sent warning letters to nine companies telling them to stop manufacturing 14 unapproved narcotics that are widely used to treat pain. Seven of those companies made or distributed the oral morphine. The morphine elixir is widely used by terminal patients in hospital and home hospice care settings and is manufactured by Lehigh Valley Technologies Inc., Mallinckrodt Inc. Pharmaceuticals Group, Boehringer Ingelheim Roxane Inc. and Cody Laboratories, Inc. In its warning letter last month, the agency gave the companies 60 days to stop manufacturing the drug before enforcement action was taken. Thursday's announcement did not prompt immediate reactions from the companies. A spokesman for Cody Laboratories said the firm did not have all the details of the decision. Other companies did not immediately return calls from CNN. The FDA estimates there are several thousand drugs, mostly older products, marketed illegally without FDA approval in this country. Once an illegally marketed drug is identified, enforcement action begins because the agency does not have information on the quality of these drugs and has not had an opportunity to approve their labeling. In 1976 the agency began a program to bring companies manufacturing these drugs into compliance. Thursday's announcement applies only to the morphine sulfate elixir 20mg/ml, and the warning letters sent to the other product manufacturers are still in effect. Currently there are no approved morphine sulfate oral solution 20mg/ml products on the market. Until there are, the FDA says it will allow companies making and distributing the unapproved drugs to continue, until 180 days after any company receives approval to manufacture a new morphine replacement drug of the same dosage. The FDA says it expects all companies marketing unapproved drugs to submit the necessary applications to get approval for those drugs.","FDA decides to extend the usage of morphine sulfate oral solution 20 mg/ml .

"(CNN) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong-il has added his brother-in-law to a military board in a move analysts say paves the way for an heir, according to South Korea's state-sponsored Yonhap news agency. Kim Jong-il has named his brother-in-law Jang Song Thaek to a top military board. The addition of his kin to the powerful National Defense Commission also solidifies his standing, Yonhap said. Kim was reappointed Thursday as chairman of the military board in his first major public appearance since a reported stroke in August. His brother-in-law, Jang Song Thaek, is considered his right-hand man, according to Yonhap. Jang, who has been married to Kim's sister since 1972, currently serves as a director of the Workers' Party, Yonhap said. ""Kim wants to keep the military in check and secure loyalty to both the military and the party,"" Cha Doo-hyeogn, a North Korea expert, told Yonhap. Kim also increased the number of members in the military agency to 13, from eight, Yonhap said. ""Overall, the power of the National Defense Commission was strengthened,"" Seoul's Unification Ministry spokesman, Kim Ho-nyoun, told Yonhap in a briefing. There were no other major changes in the new parliament, which signifies that Kim, 67, is prepared to maintain the status quo as he readies someone to take over from him, analysts told Yonhap. Kim's recent health problems and long absence from public functions have prompted speculation on whether he is ready to groom an heir to the world's only communist dynasty. But the secretive nation shields its internal affairs from international scrutiny. Analysts told Yonhap that Jang may serve as caretaker for Kim's successor, who will possibly be one of his three sons.","North Korean leader Kim Jong-il added his brother-in-law to a military board .

"(Mental Floss) -- Owning a professional sports franchise is my dream job. (I'm willing to relocate.) Of course, I could never afford my own team. There's a better chance I'll miraculously develop an unhittable slider, or learn to punt. NFL team owner Robert Kraft got his start in the paper business. You obviously must be exceedingly wealthy to become an owner. Did you ever wonder how all these people made all that money? I sure hope you did, because we went and did all this research. Here's a list of nine billionaire owners and how they built their fortunes. 1. Rich DeVos, Orlando Magic (NBA) In 1959, DeVos and high school friend Jay Van Andel started selling all-purpose cleaner. Their business grew to become Amway, which now brings in $6 billion each year under the ominous-sounding Alticor name. Whether you see Amway as an empowering direct sales company or a something resembling a cult, it sure was good to DeVos. Forbes estimates his wealth at $3.5 billion, making the paltry $85 million he spent on the Magic in 1991 a minor investment. 2. Robert L. Johnson, Charlotte Bobcats (NBA) Lower on my list of dream jobs is running a cable network that caters to urban youth. So I'm all kinds of envious of Robert L., who founded BET and sold it to Viacom for $3 billion in 2001. His fortune was depleted by an expensive divorce, but Johnson's estimated net worth is still $1.1 billion. His resume is full of firsts  BET was the first African-American owned company traded on the NYSE. He was the first African-American billionaire in the U.S. And, in 2002, he became the first African-American majority owner of a professional sports franchise. 3. Robert Kraft, New England Patriots (NFL) I'd never given it much thought, but I'd always assumed Kraft bought the Patriots with big cheese money he'd inherited. But Kraft got his start in the paper business. His wife, Myra, is the daughter of Massachusetts philanthropist Jacob Hiatt. After Kraft finished Harvard Business School, he went to work with his father-in-law's packaging company. In 1972, Kraft founded International Forest Products, which is now part of the Kraft Group -- a diversified collection of companies ranging from Gillette Stadium to the New England Revolution (Major League Soccer) to Carmel Container Systems (Israel's largest packaging plant). Kraft is seen as a savior in New England -- before he bought the team in 1994, the Pats seemed destined for relocation to St. Louis. Plus he's made them really, really good, winning three Super Bowls this decade. Another reason I'm so keen on owning a team is the access to foreign heads of state. In 2005, Kraft met Vladimir Putin, who walked off with one of Kraft's Super Bowl rings. Kraft now claims it was a gift, but that might just be what you say when a Russian leader steals your jewelry. Mental Floss: How ex-presidents and prime ministers make ends meet . 4. Hiroshi Yamauchi, Seattle Mariners (MLB) Despite America's strong resistance to Japanese ownership -- and despite his admitted lack of interest in baseball -- Hiroshi Yamauchi became majority owner of the Seattle Mariners in 1992. Yamauchi is the man credited with transforming Nintendo from playing-card company to video game giant. His 55-year tenure saw incredible growth. But that doesn't mean there weren't a few bumps along the way. Forays into instant rice, taxi service and short-stay hotels (also known as ""love hotels"") did not pan out. 5. Jerry Jones, Dallas Cowboys (NFL) Jerry Jones built an oil empire in the early 1970s, striking gas in the first thirteen wells he drilled. His father had given him a head start; Pat Jones sold the Modern Security Life Insurance Company for millions. An undersized guard, Jones was captain of the 1965 Cotton Bowl-winning Arkansas Razorbacks. Future Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson was a teammate, and Johnson's successor, Barry Switzer, was a Razorbacks assistant. Jones bought the Cowboys for an estimated $140 million in 1989. He immediately made waves by firing Tom Landry -- the only coach in Cowboys history -- and replacing him with his college buddy (the aforementioned Jimmy Johnson, who was coaching the University of Miami). After a rocky 1-15 start in 1989, the Cowboys went on to win three Super Bowls in the 1990s.   Mental Floss: A brief history of stadium naming rights . 6. Malcolm Glazer, Tampa Bay Buccaneers (NFL), Manchester United (English Premier League) Malcolm Glazer inherited a small jewelry repair business from his father. But it was Malcolm's investments in Florida trailer parks that started his financial ascent. He went on to become president and CEO of First Allied Corporation, which now owns 6,700,000 square feet of retail space. He was also chairman of Gilbert/Robinson, Inc., which managed over 100 restaurants, including Houlihan's and Darryl's. Today, the Glazer family oversees strip malls and nursing homes throughout the land. Glazer also has a large stake in Zapata, an oil company founded by George H.W. Bush. Glazer made five previous attempts to join the elite ranks of NFL ownership, including a failed 1993 bid to bring an expansion team to Baltimore. The New York Times said Glazer had ""a reputation as a franchise window shopper, one who looks at virtually every team that comes up for sale."" But in 1995, he outbid George Steinbrenner for the downtrodden Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Under his leadership, the franchise was righted, earning a Super Bowl title in 2003. Glazer also bought Manchester United, and fans weren't exactly pleased. 7. Stanley Kroenke, Denver Nuggets (NBA), Colorado Avalanche (NHL), St. Louis Rams (NFL -- partial owner) Kroenke is a self-made man who also married mega-rich. He earned his estimated $2.1 billion fortune in real estate, developing shopping centers across the country. Then he went ahead and married a Walton -- Ann Walton. Sam's niece. She's worth another $3+ billion. A sports junkie, Kroenke also owns Major League Soccer franchise Colorado Rapids and a share in Premier League's Arsenal F.C. 8. Daniel Gilbert, Cleveland Cavaliers (NBA) With $5,000 he'd earned delivering pizzas -- and after a stint as a TV reporter -- the future Cavs owner started a small mortgage company called Rock Financial in 1985. In 1999, the company was bought by Intuit for $532 million. Three years later, Gilbert bought it back for $64 mil, renaming the company Quicken Loans. He purchased the Cavaliers for $375 mil in 2005. He also owns Fathead, which makes wall decals and tiresome ads. On the side, Gilbert is working to beat Michigan's steroid-free bench-pressing record. 9. Stephen Bisciotti, Baltimore Ravens (NFL) At 48, Stephen Bisciotti is one of the NFL's youngest owners. He made his money in staffing -- specifically, finding talented engineers for the aerospace industry. With Jim Davis, Bisciotti founded Aerotek in 1983 (he was 23). Their staffing company, now known as the Allegis Group, had revenues of $4.4 billion in 2005. Bisciotti bought 49 percent of the Ravens in 2000, and purchased the rest from Art Modell in 2004.

"(CNN) -- Incumbent leader Abdelaziz Bouteflika has won a third term in office after a landslide victory in Algeria's presidential election, media reports said Friday. Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika arrives to cast his vote at a school in Algiers. Bouteflika's victory came despite calls from his political opponents for voters to boycott the polls. They claim the election was a charade, with the other presidential candidates -- from left-wing parties to Islamists -- standing no real chance. The 72-year-old was elected with over 90 percent of the vote, Reuters.com quoted the official in charge of organizing Thursday's presidential election as saying. ""Bouteflika has won ... 90.24 percent of the votes cast,"" Interior Minister Minister Noureddine Yazid Zerhouni told a news conference. Algerian lawmakers, most of them loyal to the president, cleared the way for him to stand for re-election last year by abolishing constitutional term limits. Critics said that would allow him to serve as president-for-life. Supporters of Bouteflika say he deserves credit for steering the North African country, an oil and gas producer, back to stability after a bloody civil conflict in the 1990s that killed an estimated 150,000 people. But critics say he is using the threat of renewed violence from Islamic militants to mask the country's deepening economic problems. ""I continue to regard the restoration of civil peace as a national priority, as long as hotbeds of tension and pockets of subversion survive,"" Bouteflika, running for a third term, said in his final campaign speech on Monday, Reuters.com reported. He has also promised to spend $150 billion on development projects and create 3 million jobs, his remedy for an economy in which energy accounts for about 96 percent of exports but where other sectors have been choked by red tape and under-investment.","Bouteflika, 72, win third term comfortably with 90 percent of vote .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Top Democrats have expressed concern over President Obama's plan to draw down nearly two-thirds of U.S. forces in Iraq by August 2010, while some key Republicans are offering praise. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi earlier this week questioned the need to keep 50,000 troops in Iraq until 2011. At issue: Obama plans to leave between 35,000 to 50,000 residual forces in the war-torn country, serving in a training or advisory role to the Iraqi military. All U.S. troops have to be out of Iraq by December 31, 2011, under an agreement the Bush administration signed with the Iraqi government last year. There are currently 142,000 U.S. troops in Iraq. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, indicated earlier this week that the residual force Obama is planning to leave in Iraq is too large. Pelosi on Wednesday told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow: ""I don't know what the justification is for 50,000, a presence of 50,000 troops in Iraq. ... I do think that there's a need for some. I don't know that all of them have to be in [the] country."" Pelosi clarified her concerns after Obama announced the plan at an event Friday at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. iReport.com: Do you think troops should be pulled, or should numbers increase? ""As President Obama's Iraq policy is implemented, the remaining missions given to our remaining forces must be clearly defined and narrowly focused so that the number of troops needed to perform them is as small as possible,"" Pelosi said in a press release. ""The president's decision means that the time has come at last for Iraq's own security forces to have the prime responsibility for Iraq's security."" Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-California, co-founder of the Out of Iraq House Caucus, was critical of the plan. ""I am deeply troubled by the suggestion that a force of 50,000 troops could remain in Iraq beyond this time frame,"" she said in a statement Friday. ""Call such a troop level what you will, but such a large number can only be viewed by the Iraqi public as an enduring occupation force. This is unacceptable."" Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, said that while he supports Obama's ""step in the right direction,"" the new troop plan does not ""go far enough."" ""You cannot leave combat troops in a foreign country to conduct combat operations and call it the end of the war.  You can't be in and out at the same time,"" Kucinich said in a release Friday. And top Senate Democrats echoed some of their House colleagues' skepticism. ""That's a little higher number than I expected,"" Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said Thursday. The third-ranking Senate Democrat, Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, said, ""It has to be done responsibly, we all agree. But 50,000 is more than I would have thought."" On Thursday afternoon, the president briefed bipartisan leaders from the House of Representatives and Senate -- including Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, at the White House about the troop plan. Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said that 50,000 is ""somewhat larger"" than what he expected. However, he said he has always believed ""a few tens of thousands"" of troops would be needed for noncombat missions such as training and fighting terrorism.  Watch Obama announce the new Iraq plan » . Before the White House meeting, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat and a close Obama ally, said he was anxious to get the troops home. But he defended the administration, saying it is ""trying to strike the right balance"" between ending the war and maintaining stability in Iraq. Rep. John McHugh of New York, the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, said later that Obama assured him the plan to withdraw all combat forces will be revisited if conditions on the ground in Iraq deteriorate. ""The president's objective to withdraw U.S. combat troops from Iraq is one we should pray for, plan for and work toward,"" McHugh said in a statement. ""However, I remain concerned that the security situation in Iraq is fragile, and we should work to mitigate any risks to our troops and their mission. I specifically raised these points with the president this evening."" McHugh added, ""Our commanders must have the flexibility they need in order to respond to these challenges, and President Obama assured me that there is a 'Plan B.' "" On Friday morning, McCain, who criticized Obama's plan to pull combat troops from Iraq in the presidential race, offered warm praise for the new proposal. In a speech on the Senate floor, McCain said Obama's decision is ""reasonable"" and that he is ""cautiously optimistic that the plan that is laid out by the president can lead to success."" McCain, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said that a ""failing situation in Iraq has been arrested and reversed"" due to the ""dramatic success of the surge strategy,"" referring to President Bush's plan in 2007 to send additional troops to Iraq. He also praised Obama's willingness to leave behind a significant residual force and reassess the situation if conditions change in the future. ""We are finally on a path to success"" in Iraq, McCain said. ""Let us have no crisis of confidence now."" Obama touted his opposition to the Iraq war during the presidential campaign, a position popular with liberal groups such as MoveOn.org. But according to a new CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll, many Democrats may not be satisfied with Obama's plan. When asked if the U.S. should keep the same number of troops in Iraq that are currently stationed there, 12 percent of Democratic respondents agreed -- compared with 58 percent of Republican respondents.  Watch more on the poll » . Asked if U.S. forces should be removed by ""next spring,"" 87 percent of Democrats and 39 percent of Republicans surveyed were in favor. But the survey suggested that half of all Americans think the United States is winning the war in Iraq, the highest percentage since that question was first asked in a CNN poll in 2004. ""This indicates that the public thinks the surge worked, but that hasn't changed their view of the war in Iraq at all,"" said Keating Holland, CNN polling director. ""As a result, nearly seven out of 10 favor the idea of removing most U.S. troops from Iraq by next spring, a proposal that was a key part of Obama's presidential campaign last year."" The CNN/Opinion Research poll was conducted February 18-19, with 1,046 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.

"(CNN) -- A mother and her infant were killed by a tornado that hit Murfreesboro, Tennessee, on Friday, a family member told CNN. Powerful tornado winds ripped through Murfreesboro, Tennessee, Friday, leaving a trail of destruction. About 36 people were injured, at least two of them critically, officials said. Early Saturday, officials said  about 250 homes had been damaged or destroyed. The woman who was killed, Kori Bryant, was at home with her daughter, Olivia, when the tornado struck, said family member Mark McClure. Another family member, who found the mother and daughter after the tornado, said attempts were made to resuscitate the infant, but she couldn't be saved, according to McClure. The baby was found in her car seat. Her parents had put her in the seat, thinking it would be safer for her, McClure said. The Bryants were in the hallway with the baby when the tornado struck. The woman's husband, John Bryant, was found about two houses away, McClure said. His back and ribs were broken, and a lung had collapsed. He was taken to Vanderbilt University Hospital, and he will undergo surgery when his blood pressure stabilizes, McClure said. John's brother told him yesterday that his wife and daughter had died, McClure said. The bad weather began about noon when a band of severe thunderstorms swept across the state from the southwest, said Donnie Smith, a public information officer with the Tennessee Department of Emergency Management in Nashville. Just before 1:40 p.m., the tornado hit Murfreesboro in Rutherford County, 30 miles southeast of Nashville, he said. Thirty-six people were treated for tornado-related injuries at Middle Tennessee Medical Center in Murfreesboro, said hospital spokeswoman Martha Tolbert. The search-and-rescue effort was continuing into the evening, Smith said.  Watch damage caused by tornado in Murfreesboro » . Elsewhere in the region, the town of Mena, Arkansas, is cleaning up after a tornado roared through, killing three people and damaging or destroying more than 100 homes, an Arkansas official said. The town looked like a ""war zone"" as soldiers from the Arkansas National Guard went house to house searching for victims of the twister that hit Thursday night, said Capt. Christopher Heathscott. About 50 soldiers also helped with security and food distribution. Mena, population 6,000, took a heavy hit on the west side of town, as the storm swept through downtown before heading up state Highway 71, said Tommy Jackson from the state Department of Emergency Management. ""It looks like a war zone out here,"" said James Reeves, also from the department.  Watch scenes of devastation in Mena » . The tornado damaged the county hospital, Mena City Hall, a middle school, churches, a library, the Masonic lodge and the courthouse -- which houses the 911 emergency dispatch center and a detention center, Reeves said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Pirates off the eastern coast of Africa fired on U.S. sailors Saturday as they tried to reach the lifeboat where an American captain is being held, a U.S. official familiar with the situation told CNN. The guided missile frigate USS Halyburton, with helicopter capabilities, is now at the scene. The gunfire forced the sailors, who did not return fire, back to the guided missile destroyer USS Bainbridge, the official said. Capt. Richard Phillips reportedly offered himself as a hostage to the pirates during an attack Wednesday on the U.S.-flagged container ship Maersk Alabama in the Indian Ocean. The Alabama was en route to Mombasa, Kenya, with a cargo of food aid when it was hijacked about 350 miles off the Somalia coast. The American crew regained control of the vessel, but the Maersk company would not say how. There are about 20 crew members. The Alabama arrived Saturday in Mombasa, along with an 18-person armed security detail on board. ""For security reasons, the vessel will berth in a restricted area of the port and will not be accessible to the media. FBI agents will debrief members of the crew on board the vessel before they disembark. The crew will not be available to the media in Mombasa,"" Maersk Ltd. said.  Watch the latest Maersk briefing » . The U.S. Navy -- which is in charge of the situation -- requested help from the FBI to resolve the standoff. The FBI is launching a criminal investigation into the hijacking and hostage-taking, two law enforcement officials told CNN. The probe will be led by the FBI's New York field office, which has responsibility for looking into cases involving U.S. citizens in the African region. Agents from the office were scheduled to leave for Africa sometime this weekend, the officials said. Phillips lives in Underhill, Vermont, where neighbor and longtime family friend, Tom Walsh, told CNN the captain's wife, Andrea, was surrounded by relatives. ""If they need us to help with anything. That's kind of the way it is in these communities. ... just showing that we're concerned. We want to do whatever she needs,"" Walsh said. ""She has a lot of family there.""  Watch more about the hostage situation » . Earlier Saturday, pirates sailing a hijacked German cargo ship returned to port after failing to reach the area of the standoff with the Bainbridge, a local journalist told CNN. The German ship Hansa Stavanger was among several pirated vessels trying to sail to the area some 300 miles off the Somali coast, a Somali journalist told CNN. The pirate crew had intended to help the pirates holding Phillips but turned back because of the U.S. naval presence, the journalist said. The Hansa Stavanger is now at the Somali port of Eyl, the journalist said. The Hansa Stavanger was hijacked April 4 off the Somali coast. Pirates have been searching the waters off Africa's coast for the Alabama's lifeboat, a U.S. military official with knowledge of the situation said Friday. They are using hijacked vessels and skiffs launched from larger ships, the official said. The guided missile frigate USS Halyburton, with helicopter capabilities, has joined the Bainbridge in the area. A third ship, the amphibious assault ship USS Boxer -- with a medical facility aboard -- should be there by the end of the day. iReport.com: Share your thoughts on how the pirates are being handled . Phillips is being held by four gunmen in the covered, fiberglass lifeboat. He jumped overboard at one point to try to escape, but one of the pirates jumped into the water after him and brought him back onboard the 28-foot boat. The pirates fired shots, the military official said, without providing further details. Phillips appeared to be tied up by the pirates after the escape attempt, a Defense Department official told CNN. For the U.S. Navy, bringing in more firepower is more than just a means to resolve a hostage situation, said Chris Lawrence, CNN's Pentagon correspondent. Attacks in the area have picked up so drastically in recent months that the Navy has to reposition some of its fleet to deal with the threats, he said. The pirates have shown no signs of giving in. Meanwhile, the acts of piracy were having an effect on tourists disembarking from ships in Mombasa. ""Well, we got the international news stories on television on the ship and everybody's concerned about the route that we were on because there was always the possibility that we would be approached by pirates,"" one male passenger said.

"(CNN) -- When Brian Burton, a little known DJ operating under the name of Danger Mouse, released ""The Grey Album"" in 2003, he brought to mainstream attention a new form of musical genre made possible by the advance of modern technology and the Internet. He also inadvertently sparked a debate about record labels' monopoly of music ownership. ""The Grey Album"" consists of a series of ""mash-ups,"" songs made by splicing together elements from two or more separate tracks, the vocals from one, the music from others. Burton used the vocal tracks from rapper Jay Z's ""Black Album"" and music from The Beatles' ""White Album"". The album was well received. His decision to bring together the world's biggest hip hop star with the best-selling band of all time probably contributed to its positive reception by the critics. It was described as ""the most creatively captivating"" album of the year by The Boston Globe and voted best album of 2004 by Entertainment Weekly. But its success probably owes just as much to the controversy it caused. While Jay Z had released his ""a capella"" vocal tracks with the intention that they could be used as sampling material, Burton had borrowed the Beatles' music without permission from the copyright holders, EMI Music. EMI moved swiftly to block sales of the album but anti-copyright activists stepped in, and battle lines were drawn. Downhill Battle, a group that campaigns for a fairer music industry, organized an online protest, dubbed ""Grey Tuesday"" in which they offered up the album to download for free on approximately 170 Web sites as a form of deliberate civil disobedience. With over 100,000 downloads, Downhill Battle claims that ""The Grey Album"" was the number one album in the United States on the day. The two groups represented polar opposite points of view. EMI's position was that they earn a livelihood out of the music. By blocking the sale of this album they were simply protecting their investment. Downhill Battle, on the other hand, argued that while copyright holders should get a cut of the proceeds from the sale of music, the licence fees were far too high and too large a proportion goes to the music label and not to individual artists. Moreover, they argued, music was built on a tradition of sharing and much that is good has come from one artist passing the baton to another, who might give a different interpretation, even improve, on an original work. ""The reason we have copyright is to ensure that creators are able to benefit from the things that they do so that they can keep creating,"" says Nicholas Reville, Director at Downhill Battle. ""What's happened to copyright with music recently is that it has been used as a way to restrict creativity, limit art and censor what people are allowed to do. ""What made 'The Grey Album' so significant was that it brought together two of the most popular musical acts from two different eras into a totally new piece of art that was considered by everybody as culturally significant. There's no reason why any society would not want that creation to exist."" Reville says that Downhill Battle's argument is that copyright should exist but that laws should be reviewed so that bedroom musicians everywhere can have access to sample music without needing a lawyer to guide them through the legal quagmire. The ""mash-up"" is not a new phenomenon. In Indian music there is a tradition of borrowing tunes and melodies and incorporating them into new compositions. Western folk music also encouraged the practice of passing on songs for reinterpretation by new generations. As a musical genre, the ""mash-up's"" origins lie in the birth of hip hop, when DJs such as Kool Herc and Grandmaster Flash began using the drum sections form vinyl records as a back-beat for MC's to rap over. The development of the Internet has simply fast-forwarded the culture of borrowing by making it all that much easier -- ""mash-up"" artists have access to so much more music than their forebears. And peer-to-peer and social networking sites mean that ""mash-ups"" have found a distribution system that by-passes the usual gate-keepers - record companies and music stores. ""There are elements of this idea that have been around for a long time,"" says Rupert Evans of yourspins.com. ""Mozart wrote a piano concerto where every time you finished a bar you're meant to roll a dice to see what it was you played next. ""People have always been into the idea of how you can break things down and put them back together and I think it's something that's been highlighted recently due to technology and the hip hop 'vibe' has taken it and tried to twist it around. ""When people first started recording music it meant you were stuck with just one version. There isn't supposed to be a definitive version."" It would seem that artists are beginning to cotton on. At yourspins.com musicians such as Moby, Robbie Williams, Roots Manuva and Natasha Bedingfield have released their work for remixing by the public. The musicians provide the user with a selection of variations on the different elements of a song -- bass line, drum, vocals, etc. -- which can be put together in any order. The result is ""as many versions of the song as there are atoms in the universe,"" says Evans. There is one large distinction between what Danger Mouse was doing with ""The Grey Album"" and the music produced by remixers on yourspins.com. While ""The Grey Album"" was championed as an original work of art, Evans does not believe that the same can be said of yourspins.com's remixes. ""It's a hard distinction to defend but [Danger Mouse] picked a couple of things himself. There was some creativity in saying: 'I can put this and that together', whereas we are giving people a toolkit,"" says Evans. In yourspins.com's legal framework, the copyright still belongs to the artist who can even sell on the remix if they wish. Evans says that the laws have relaxed since he first set up yourspins.com. ""At the beginning a lawyer was telling me that every time someone wanted to go on my Web site they would have to sign a paper saying that they weren't going to claim copyright over what they had created, and the artist was going to have to sign a paper giving permission every time, which obviously wouldn't have worked,"" he says. Technology is breaking down the barriers between musicians and their audiences, allowing both sides to interact in ways that would have been unimaginable thirty years ago, but the record companies are still holding on stubbornly to their monopoly of the market, and it seems there is still a fair way to go before musical culture becomes truly democratic.

"(Oprah.com) -- Are you truly happy? If you were presented with a group of people you've never met, could you determine who was really satisfied with their life? A panel of five people took a test to see how happy they really are. Based on this picture and a brief description, see if you can tell who is the happiest! From left to right: Peggy, Noreen, Lachelle, David and Lorrie. Peggy (pictured on far left) is a 44-year-old married mother of two teenage boys who works as the bookkeeper of the family business. Last year, both her father and her sister died, and her mother has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Noreen (second from the left) is a 52-year-old divorced mother of two college kids. She's an avid swimmer and works in the operations department of a major airline. Lachelle (middle) is 27 years old, married and has no children. She works two jobs and has two dogs. Last year, four of her friends and two of her family members died within six months of each other. David (second from the right) is 53 years old, and he's been a funeral director for 30 years. He is married and has two sons. Lorrie (pictured on far right) has been married for 15 years and has six children. She works in retail and also serves as the vice president of her PTA. Peggy, David and Lachelle scored the highest on the satisfaction scale, while Noreen and Lorrie scored the lowest. Satisfaction for Peggy is achieved by surrounding herself with happiness. The most important thing? Her husband. ""He is there for me. He doesn't only love me, he appreciates me and makes me feel good,"" Peggy says. Happiness doesn't depend on money, she says. It's about enjoying the simple things. ""Every morning I have a ritual. After the boys have left, [my husband and I] get in the hot tub, and it's our time. We talk about what is going on for the rest of the day. It is just our quality time just to stay connected."" David, the funeral director, says he's developed phrases that help him keep a positive outlook. ""I will say, 'It's a marvelous Monday. It's a terrific Tuesday,'"" he says. Although he deals with death daily, David says his job is anything but depressing. ""Most people look upon funeral service as a sad profession. I look upon it as a profession where I'm helping people at a very difficult time in their lives,"" he says. ""Being successful in life is not what really matters. Being significant in life is really the core root of what matters."" Lachelle says she lives by the philosophy, ""Negative out, positive in."" She says she believes happiness is a conscious effort. ""It's about claiming what's yours. If you want a positive life, you need to think positively and act positively,"" she says. ""I do my best not to compare myself with others. I've always felt that what one person has may not be destined for me."" Dr. Robert Holden has dedicated his life to studying the pursuit of happiness. The psychologist is the founder of the Happiness Project in England and the author of 10 best-selling books, including ""Happiness Now!"" Dr. Holden says those looking for happiness often don't realize they already have it. It's a lesson that he says he was lucky to learn at age 18 from a spiritual teacher. ""He said, 'Look, actually, Robert, you're already happy.' And I said, 'Well, that's great, but I don't feel it. So tell me, what do I have to do?'"" Dr. Holden recalls. ""And he said, 'You have to understand that the pursuit of happiness is a mistake. It's like, you don't chase happiness out there. You learn that you're happy inside you, and then you go running. Then you go into the world.'"" When looking at the guests who scored the highest on the happiness scale, Dr. Holden says he instantly recognizes the keys to their satisfaction. For David, it's his job. ""Your job just helps you to have a great perspective on life, which is, 'We're just here for a short spell, and it's really important to make the most of it,'"" Dr. Holden says. Lachelle uses the law of attraction to stay happy, Dr. Holden says. ""Lachelle, basically what I see is that you've chosen to be an optimist. You have had some difficult times in your life, and you've had bad circumstances, but you've made great choices. And this is how the law of attraction works,"" he says. ""What I found is that basically we have beliefs about life, and our perception gathers evidence to prove that our beliefs are right. So an optimist believes that good things can come from bad situations."" After taking the happiness test, Noreen found that she received the lowest score possible -- a 5 out of 35. So how can Noreen find fulfillment? Dr. Holden says to look within her heart. ""What really occurs to me is ... you are such a good person. ... But I realized that you've not made some of the best choices in your life in the past,"" Dr. Holden says. ""Those choices, I think, are being motivated really by a lack of what I call self-acceptance, which is where we somehow don't believe we deserve any more than we have."" The law of attraction could make a big difference for Noreen, Dr. Holden says. ""The way the law of attraction works is that as we increase our self-acceptance, we attract more happiness,"" he says. Dr. Holden says Noreen needs to realize she is, indeed, a great person. One way she can do that is to surround herself with people who already know that. ""I think it's also great to have some friends around you who can remind you, because we do forget,"" Dr. Holden says. Noreen says she feels like she's taking her first step on the road to happiness. ""I feel like I'm starting. I can feel it,"" she says. Lorrie scored in the middle range of the satisfaction test and says people often mistake her for being happy because she puts on a false front, whether she's being a room mom for one of her six children or attending a PTA meeting. Dr. Holden gets to the root of her dissatisfaction. ""You're so good at helping everybody else, I think you're in danger of leaving yourself out of your own life,"" Dr. Holden says. ""What we have here is a classic what I call a martyr ethic, which is where we're putting everybody else first instead of ourselves."" In fact, Dr. Holden says Lorrie can help herself and give an important gift to her family -- her own happiness. ""I know you ... want your children to be happy, and I tell you this: You can't just tell them to be happy. You show them with your example. And that's the big key,"" Dr. Holden says. Lorrie can start today by simply asking for help. ""I think the big mistake here, and it's a common one, is that we try to do our lives by ourselves,"" Dr. Holden says.

"(CNN) -- Nearly eight years later, Connie Chung still remembers being surprised. ""Stonewalling is what gets politicians in trouble, when they ... try to cover up,"" Connie Chung says. It was one of those television moments that linger in the national consciousness, like Barbara Walters sitting down with Monica Lewinsky, Dan Rather with Saddam Hussein, or Jay Leno asking Hugh Grant what the hell he had been thinking. Chung was with ABC then, and she got the ""get"" -- the first interview with Gary Condit, the California congressman at the center of the Chandra Levy media frenzy. The former Washington intern, you'll recall, had been found murdered in Rock Creek Park, and law enforcement sources let it be known that the married Condit had been having an affair with her. In an interview airing Sunday on ""Reliable Sources"" (10 a.m. ET, during CNN's ""State of the Union with John King""), Chung says she was surprised when Condit refused to acknowledge the romantic relationship. ""Stonewalling is what gets politicians in trouble, when they stonewall or they try to cover up,"" she says. ""I think that the general public and the news media wanted him to be honest, and if he could be honest about that part of the story, then he could be -- then he would be believed when he was answering other questions as to whether or not he had anything to do with her disappearance."" I often focus on media excess and media mistakes on the program, but we also try to highlight good journalism. The segment includes two Washington Post reporters, Sari Horwitz and Scott Higham, who cracked the Levy mystery in a 13-part series last year. They did what the D.C. police could not: They identified Ingmar Guandique, an illegal Salvadoran immigrant, as Levy's likely killer. Authorities issued an arrest warrant for the imprisoned suspect this week. But Horwitz and Higham talk about how they were roundly criticized for resurrecting the case and accused of sensationalizing it. It's clear that Levy's case became a huge deal in 2001 because of the Condit connection. At the same time, Chung says, ""The news media had changed. This was the gradual evolution of what the news media was doing. There was flavor of the week, the story du jour."" The Levy frenzy became the precursor for the missing-women TV melodramas that followed: Laci Peterson, Stacy Peterson, Natalee Holloway. The stories of women who were not celebrities, whom no one had heard of before, became national soap operas because they drove cable and morning show ratings. At least, in Levy's case, the soap opera appears to be drawing to a close.","Congressman wouldn't admit affair with murdered former intern .

"(CNN)  -- The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution on Tuesday aimed at combating piracy along the Horn of Africa by allowing military forces to chase pirates onto land in cases of ""hot pursuit."" French troops on the lookout for pirates in the Gulf of Aden on November 25. Military forces from various countries, including the United States, are patrolling pirate-infested waters off Somalia, where attacks have surged this year. Nearly 100 vessels have come under fire, according to the International Maritime Bureau, and almost 40 vessels have been hijacked. The Security Council resolution, which passed unanimously, expands upon existing counter-piracy tools, including a stipulation that would allow for national and regional military forces to chase pirates onto land -- specifically into Somalia where many of the pirates are based. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was at the U.N. on Tuesday for a discussion of the piracy problem and the Security Council vote. ""I wouldn't be here seeking authorization to go ashore if the U.S. government -- perhaps most importantly the president of the United States -- were not behind this resolution,"" Rice said after the vote. Asked if she thought U.S. troops would soon be on land chasing pirates, Rice would not speculate. ""The United States is part of an international effort,"" she said. ""We do have naval forces that have been involved in this effort. What this (resolution) does is to authorize that the boundary of the maritime cannot become a safe haven boundary for pirates. What we do -- or do not do -- in issues like hot pursuit, we'll have to see ... case by case."" Earlier, in remarks to the Security Council, Rice described the growing problem of piracy off the coast of Somalia as ""a symptom."" ""It's a symptom of the instability, the poverty, the lawlessness that have plagued Somalia for the past two decades,"" she said, adding that the Bush administration ""does believe that the time has come for the United Nations to consider and authorize a peacekeeping operation."" Asked about reports that two more ships were attacked by pirates this week, Rice said those show ""the increasing problem that this is. The pirates are a threat to commerce, they are a threat to security and perhaps most importantly they are a threat to the principle of freedom of navigation on the seas."" With increased patrols in the area by several countries, reports of exchanges of fire have become more frequent. In one of the most recent piracy attacks, Indian officials said Saturday they had captured 23 people suspected of trying to take over a merchant vessel in the Gulf of Aden. In addition to the 12 Somali and 11 Yemeni suspects, Indian navy officials also seized two small boats and ""a substantial cache of arms and equipment,"" the Indian military said in a statement.","Military forces from various countries are patrolling pirate-infested waters off Somalia .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Gen. Ray Odierno, the top U.S. military commander in Iraq, said Sunday he believes U.S. troops will be out of the country by the end of 2011. Gen.

"Editor's note: Eric Cantor, a Republican serving his fifth term representing the 7th District of Virginia, was elected last month as the Republican Whip, the party's second-highest position in the House of Representatives. He also serves on the House Ways and Means Committee. Rep. Eric Cantor says Republicans want to make sure the massive economic stimulus plan is used wisely. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Bolstered by wide Democratic margins in both chambers of Congress, the new administration assumes power Tuesday with a broad public mandate to repair the feeble economy. But with such a free hand over current stimulus efforts comes great danger. Costing at the very least a hefty $825 billion, the plan's potential for taxpayer waste and special-interest-driven giveaways is enormous. We Republicans believe we can help mitigate those risks if we are given a meaningful place at the table. President-elect Barack Obama was correct to point out recently that no one party has a monopoly over sound ideas. Rather than presenting an obstacle, House Republicans intend to use the full force of our ideas to help Democrats produce a better package to help pull the country back from the economic abyss. Specifically, we want to keep the stimulus bill -- as well as all other future economic ""rescue"" measures -- limited in scope and transparent. Our country has no other choice. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) issued a sobering report that this year's deficit will likely climb to over 8 percent of U.S. gross domestic product, or $1.2 trillion. That's higher than at any point since World War II -- and those figures don't even account for the forthcoming stimulus. Such heavy borrowing runs the risk down the line of rampant inflation, which scares away foreign capital while making the purchasing power of the dollar weaker for American consumers. While deflation may be the more immediate threat that the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department are correctly focused on, uncontrolled spending and borrowing could easily necessitate much higher Treasury interest rates to keep foreigners financing our mounting debt. Especially given the looming entitlement crisis, this poses heavy danger for businesses and families alike. Let's not lay the groundwork for future financial catastrophe. Let's lay it for future growth. The stimulus can do that by focusing exclusively on strengthening businesses, boosting job creation and lifting consumer confidence. Our preferred strategy is to provide meaningful tax relief directly to middle-class taxpayers and the small businesses that they operate or work for. Particularly in down times, tax cuts can lift an economy by encouraging work, investment and business expansion. That should be the aim of the $300 billion in tax cuts the president-elect has pledged -- an apparent recognition, however overdue, that tax cuts are in fact stimulative for the economy. But we also accept that these are dizzyingly uncertain economic days for our country. The Democrats have proposed additional spending for infrastructure and the like, ostensibly to compensate for stagnation in the private sector. Like bears sniffing out food at a campfire pit, those looking for a piece of the multi-billion dollar pie have flooded Washington with a cascade of requests, some capable of spurring immediate and lasting growth, others falling hopelessly short. In order for the public to know that money is not wasted, two things are needed. First, we need to reconcile the American people's demands for swift action with the fact that a good bill requires time -- time to hold hearings, read the bill in painstaking detail, and root out waste. Second, Democrats have to live up to President-elect Obama's vow for ""unprecedented transparency."" The GOP welcomes and strongly encourages the president-elect's idea to post all contents of the bill online for the American people to judge. Lastly, any new spending must be introduced with the clear understanding that it is temporary rather than permanent. It is not always easy to terminate spending programs once they have been funded, but our bleak long-term budget outlook requires significant sacrifices over the coming years. We trust the Democrats' assurances that the economic stimulus will not be turned into a grab bag for favored interests. Serving as the honest and fair check on majority power, we will work to ensure they keep their word. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Eric Cantor.","Rep.

"(CNN) -- Sen. Barack Obama on Monday detailed what his campaign called a four-part ""economic rescue plan"" for the middle class. ""I'm proposing a number of steps that we should take immediately to stabilize our financial system, provide relief to families and communities, and help struggling homeowners,"" Obama said at a campaign event in Toledo, Ohio. ""It's a plan that begins with one word that's on everyone's mind, and it's easy to spell: J-O-B-S."" Obama's plan comes as aides to Sen. John McCain said their candidate would likely wait to lay out any further plans until the Treasury issues a report or recommendations on what to do with the bailout. McCain has already unveiled a plan to buy $300 billion in troubled mortgages and renegotiate the terms directly with homeowners. On Friday, he endorsed the idea of suspending the current requirement that seniors start drawing down their retirement plans -- IRAs and 401(k)s -- once they reach age 70½. Obama on Monday proposed a temporary tax credit for firms that create new jobs in the United States over the next two years, and penalty-free withdrawals from IRAs and 401(k)s in 2008 and 2009. The Democratic candidate called for new legislation that would give families the option of withdrawing as much as 15 percent of their retirement savings --- up to a maximum of $10,000 --- without facing a tax penalty this year or next.  He also called for a temporary lifting of taxes on unemployment insurance benefits. The Illinois senator also proposed a 90-day foreclosure moratorium for homeowners acting in good faith, and a new effort to address the growing credit crisis at the state and local level. Under the Obama plan, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury would provide much the same kind of backing to state and municipal governments as the recent federal bailout did to the commercial credit market. ""We can't wait to help workers and families and communities who are struggling right now -- who don't know if their job or their retirement will be there tomorrow; who don't know if next week's paycheck will cover this month's bills,"" Obama said. ""We need to pass an economic rescue plan for the middle-class ... and we need to do it right now."" The McCain campaign said Obama's economic rescue plan was a political move that would not provide solutions. ""It is clear that the economy is hurting, that Americans need across-the-board tax relief, and yet Barack Obama has proven unwilling to break with the left-wing of his party and stand up for the American taxpayer,"" spokesman Tucker Bounds said. Fact check: Obama's tax plan and small businesses . ""Interestingly, Barack Obama called [for] a moratorium on foreclosures, which is a policy he had previously labeled 'disastrous' when it was proposed by a political opponent. Proving yet again that Barack Obama's positions on the issues are tied to elections, not solutions for the American people,"" he said. During the primaries, Obama criticized Sen. Hillary Clinton's plan, which, unlike his, included a freeze on interest rates. Earlier Monday, McCain delivered a speech that a senior aide predicted would ""begin a turnaround for the campaign."" On the new tone, the aide said the campaign decided to go ""back to basics"" with McCain on what he can offer. McCain told voters Monday that they should elect him because ""what America needs in this hour is a fighter."" ""I will fight to take America in a new direction from my first day in office until my last. I'm not afraid of the fight, I'm ready for it,"" McCain said at a rally in Virginia Beach, Virginia.  Watch what's going on in battleground Virginia » . ""Let me give you the state of the race today and some straight talk. We have 22 days to go. We're 6 points down. The national media has written us off,"" McCain said to a sea of boos. CNN's most recent poll of polls shows Obama leading McCain by 8 percentage points, 50 to 42 percent. ""Sen. Obama is measuring the drapes, and planning with Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi and Sen. [Harry] Reid to raise taxes, increase spending, take away your right to vote by secret ballot in labor elections, and concede defeat in Iraq. ... But they forgot to let you decide. My friends, we've got them just where we want them,"" he said. Obama's campaign dismissed the Arizona senator's remarks as a ""political speech about where he is in the polls.""  Watch where the election stands » . ""Less than 12 hours after his campaign announced that Sen. McCain would finally have some new ideas on the economy, he decided that it was more important to give a new political speech about where he is in the polls,"" said Obama-Biden communications director Dan Pfeiffer. McCain advisers downplayed weekend reports that the Arizona senator would be unveiling several economic proposals over the final three weeks of the campaign, saying it was likely he would lay out one or two new ideas, but not the swarm that had been rumored. They also downplayed a Sunday suggestion by McCain surrogate Lindsey Graham that a new economic plan rollout might focus on plans to cut taxes on capital gains and dividends, saying that the South Carolina senator had good ideas but that they had not yet been approved by the campaign. CNN's national poll of polls consists of six surveys: ABC/Washington Post (October 8-11), Fox News/Opinion Dynamics (October 8-9), Newsweek (October 8-9), Reuters/C-SPAN/Zogby (October 10-12), Gallup (October 10-12) and Diageo/Hotline (October 10-12).

"GENEVA, Alabama (CNN) -- The gunman who authorities said launched a shooting rampage over three south Alabama towns, slaying 10 people in his path before killing himself, was once a police officer in Samson, the small town hit hardest by the deadliest crime in the state's history. Authorities identified the shooter, seen in a yearbook photo, as Michael McLendon, 28, of Kinston, Alabama. Authorities identified the shooter as Michael McLendon, 28, of Kinston, Alabama, in Coffee County. Speaking at several news conferences on Wednesday, authorities also released a detailed timeline of the rampage -- which lasted less than an hour -- and identified the victims. Investigators late Wednesday said they were closer to finding a motive behind why McLendon would fatally shoot his mother in his hometown of Kinston before moving on to open fire in Samson and then Geneva. ""Evidence collected does indicate his reasons -- what the reason are I can't get into right now,"" said Lt. Barry Tucker of the Alabama Bureau of Investigations. ""He was somewhat depressed about job issues, but the information we have does not specify [the motive] was job-related."" Coffee County District Attorney Gary McAliley told the newspaper in nearby Dothan that McLendon likely planned the rampage for a while. He said investigators have found dozens of ammunition boxes, military and survival gear and medical supplies at McLendon's Kinston home. The Alabama Bureau of Investigation said authorities recovered a phone list and a notebook from the home, ""but there is no evidence that indicates a hit list of any kind."" Tucker said the notebook contained, ""a couple of pages of notes, people he worked with, places he worked -- it was over a year old."" Asked whether the notes expressed grievances against others, Tucker said no. The assault Tuesday ended at the Reliable Metal Products plant in Geneva, 24 miles from Kinston. Police said McLendon engaged in a shootout before killing himself inside the building. McLendon shot and killed at least 10 people, including two children, and wounded at least four others, officials said. McLendon, who had no known criminal record before carrying out the rampage, worked briefly as a police officer in Samson, but failed to complete the ""required training"" at the police academy in Montgomery in 2003, according to Alabama State Trooper Capt. Marc McHenry. He ""didn't last a week and a half"" at the academy and received no firearms training there, Murphy said. ""We believe he fired in excess of 200 rounds during the assaults,"" Alabama State Police Cpl. Steve Jarrett said.  See photos of the shooting scenes » . The rampage began Tuesday afternoon when McLendon shot and killed his mother before setting fire to the home he shared with her in Kinston, near the Alabama-Florida state line. He then headed to Samson, where he opened fire on his uncle's front porch as his uncle and other relatives stood outside with the neighbors from across the street.  Mayor: ""Shock and disbelief"" » . Those neighbors happened to be the family of Geneva County Sheriff's Deputy Josh Myers, who was later involved in a shoot-out with the gunman, unaware that McLendon had shot and killed his wife and young daughter and critically injured his nearly 4-month-old baby, Ella Kay. A family friend found the couple's 4-year-old son hiding in the Myers' home after the shooting. Five people, including Myers' wife, Andrea, and their 1½-year-old daughter, Corinne Gracy, were killed on the porch. McLendon then opened fire on his grandmother, who was standing in the doorway of her home next door. Watch deputy ask for prayers for wounded daughter » . Alina Knowles was in her home in Samson when she heard the gunman fire on the porch so many times that it sounded like a horror film. After the shooting stopped, Knowles saw the gunman flee the area and drive around the block.  Watch the aftermath of the shooting spree » . Knowles, a certified nurse assistant, looked around for survivors. She saw members of Myers' family dead on the porch, but nobody's chest was moving to signal they were alive. Then she heard Myers' baby girl, Ella Kay, crying. ""[I] picked her up, came between the two vehicles,"" she said. ""Saw him coming up the road, ducked so he wouldn't see me, as he was coming up this way I ducked, was still ducking and moving around their van trying to keep him from seeing me with that baby."" Knowles said she knew if she wasn't careful, the gunman would target her. ""I would have been dead,"" she said. ""I would have been on that ground there."" Knowles was able to get the deputy's child and herself to safety. But the horror of the events sticks with her. ""I was scared,"" she said. ""The scene I saw, there was no words for it. None at all. There is no describing what I saw."" McLendon then shot and killed two bystanders in Samson before heading to Reliable Metal Products. There, he exchanged fire with Myers and another officer in the parking lot before entering the building, where he shot and killed himself. ""We truly are shocked at this,"" said Col. Christopher Murphy, the director of the Alabama Department of Public Safety. ""This event formed the single deadliest crime recorded in Alabama.""  Watch a timeline of the shootings » . Samson Mayor Clay King said he knew McLendon and all of the victims in the small southern Alabama town.  Watch CNN's Anderson Cooper talk about the investigation » . ""I coached him in both T-ball and Little League baseball along with my two sons,"" he said of McLendon. McLendon worked nearly two years at food manufacturer and distributor Kelley Foods in Elba, about 25 miles north of Samson. He quit his job last week, the company said. The company didn't specify what his position was, but said he was a ""reliable team leader"" who was well-liked.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- New York celebrates the centennial of its most famous New Year's tradition Monday, as organizers of the Times Square ball drop have given the crystal globe an environmental makeover. Technicians prepare the New York Times Square ball Thursday for the event's 100th anniversary. This year the 1,415-pound ball has been outfitted with more than 9,500 energy-efficient light-emitting diodes that will illuminate the ball's more than 600 crystals. The LEDs will use the same amount of electricity as about 10 toasters, say event officials. That's a dramatic overhaul from 1907's first Times Square ball, which was made from iron and wood and was covered with about 100 light bulbs.  Watch the computer-controlled ball » . New York police estimate about a million people will crowd Times Square to watch the ball drop from a flagpole atop the One Times Square building at midnight. Another billion people worldwide are expected to watch the spectacle on video, said Tom Chiodo, a spokesman for the Times Square Alliance. Of those viewers, 100 million will be in the United States, he said. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg will be joined by Iraq war veteran Karolina Wierzchowska, who was also a Ground Zero guard worker and a New York Police Academy valedictorian -- to push the button for the ball drop at 11:59 p.m. Weather forecasts indicate clear skies for the celebration, with temperatures in the 40s -- a mild departure from inclement weather gripping much of the Northeast. In an effort to help people stay warm, New York City sanitation workers will be passing out ""goody bags"" from the Times Square Alliance that will include mittens and hats, said Chiodo. The event will include musical performances from Hannah Montana, the Jonas Brothers, Kid Rock, Lenny Kravitz, Lifehouse, The Bravery, and alums from Fox TV's ""American Idol,"" Carrie Underwood, Jordin Sparks and Blake Lewis. Security inside Times Square will be tight and everyone should expect to have their bags searched at least three times, said New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly on CNN's ""American Morning."" In addition to a heavy police presence on the ground, Kelly said the NYPD's counterterrorism unit, radiation detectors and helicopters will also be patrolling the crowds. Kelly said that once the Times Square attendees pass the entrance gates, they will not be able to leave. New York's terrorist threat level remains at orange -- the nation's second highest level -- as it has since the September 11, 2001, attacks. ""We certainly haven't let our guard down,"" Kelly said. As the ball drops, the new year will be greeted with a massive fireworks explosion, some 168 shots in the first five seconds alone, and a downpour of two tons of fireproof confetti. Some of the confetti includes New Year's wishes that were written by visitors to the city in nearly two dozen languages. Over the past week, visitors from across the country wrote their messages on a Times Square ""Wishing Wall."" ""I want to turn the world green and the water clean,"" one person wrote. ""Let my husband stop snoring,"" another wrote, while others were more serious: ""That my mom will get her kidney transplant"" and ""Peace in Pakistan.""

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A few hundred people on Sunday marched in Brooklyn to protest last week's fatal beating of a 31-year-old Ecuadorean man -- an incident authorities say may have been a hate crime. Jose Sucuzhanay was beaten December 7 after leaving a party at a church. The demonstrators -- holding signs reading ""No more hate crimes"" -- walked a half-mile in the neighborhood where police say Jose Sucuzhanay was hit in the head with a bottle and beaten with an aluminum baseball bat on December 7. Sucuzhanay died of his injuries Friday at Elmhurst Hospital, hours before his mother arrived in New York from Ecuador, his family said. Police said Sucuzhanay's attackers yelled racial slurs; no arrests have been made in the case. One of his brothers, Diego Sucuzhanay, said Sunday he is convinced the attack was a hate crime. ""Nothing was taken from him,"" said Diego Sucuzhanay, who didn't join the demonstration, opting instead to help his mother make arrangements to return the body to Ecuador.  Watch marchers protest against hate crimes » . Police said Jose Sucuzhanay and his brother Romel had left a party at a church when several men approached them in a car in Brooklyn's Bushwick section, about a block from the brothers' home. The men shouted anti-gay and anti-Latino vulgarities and attacked the brothers, police said. Romel, 34, escaped with minor scrapes and has talked with detectives. Police have released a sketch of one possible suspect in the case. Police are offering a $22,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in the attack. In a statement, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg called the attack ""a pointless and gutless crime."" He promised authorities would find and prosecute those responsible. Family spokesman Francisco Moya said Jose Sucuzhanay had lived in the United States for more than a decade and was a legal resident. Diego Sucuzhanay said Jose set up a successful real estate business in a low-income area, thinking he could make a difference there. He said his brother wanted to help everyone and hired a diverse team, including four African-Americans and two Latinos. He was raising two children: a 9-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter. ""We were proud of him,"" Diego Sucuzhanay said. He said the family had wanted Jose's mother to get to his bedside before he died. Doctors told them Jose was brain dead since the attack, and that machines kept him alive until his heart failed Friday. At a press conference Sunday outside the hospital, Diego Sucuzhanay touched his chest and said: ""My heart is broken, but my brother's [memory] will live on. "" Asked in an interview with CNN how his brother would be remembered, he paused several seconds and answered: ""For being the victim of a hate crime."" Though he didn't participate in the demonstration, he said he was grateful to those who did, and that everyone needs to practice tolerance. ""We definitely have to speak out,"" he said.","Police say December 7 beating of Jose Sucuzhanay may have been a hate crime .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President-elect Barack Obama called his former Republican presidential rival, Sen. John McCain, a hero at a bipartisan dinner Monday night and encouraged politicians to reach across the aisle. President-elect Barack Obama greets Sen. John McCain on stage after praising him at a bipartisan dinner. ""I could stand here and recite the long list of John's bipartisan accomplishments ..."" Obama said. ""Campaign finance reform. Immigration. The Patients' Bill of Rights. All those times he has crossed the aisle and risked the ire of his party for the good of his country. And yet, what makes John such a rare and courageous public servant is not the accomplishments themselves, but the true motivation behind them."" McCain returned the gracious feelings at the dinner. ""I am very grateful to the president-elect and to all of you for this very considerate gesture, and for allowing me to play a small role in the inauguration of the 44th president of the United States, even if it isn't the one I had in mind a few months ago,"" McCain said. ""Tomorrow, the President-elect will accept the burdensome privilege of leading America to its next accomplishments and its future greatness,"" McCain went on to say. ""He has my sincere best wishes for his success, and my promise of assistance. For his success will be our success."" After praising McCain, Obama urged everyone to take the bipartisan dinner past ""just an inaugural tradition"" and turn it into a ""new way of doing the people's business in this city."" ""We will not always agree on everything in the months to come, and we will have our share of arguments and debates,"" Obama said. ""But let us strive always to find that common ground, and to defend together those common ideals, for it is the only way we can meet the very big and very serious challenges that we face right now."" On the eve of his inauguration, the president-elect even made time for a joke. ""I'm here tonight to say a few words about an American hero I have come to know very well and admire very much -- Sen. John McCain,"" Obama said as he opened his speech. ""And then, according to the rules agreed to by both parties, John will have approximately 30 seconds to make a rebuttal."" Obama's speech at the bipartisan dinner capped a day filled by appearances, including visiting wounded soldiers and exhorting Americans to spend more time in the service of others. In Washington people took in the sights of pre-inauguration activities and concerts. ""The energy on the streets is something I've never seen before,"" said Nancy Wigal, who lives in Vernon Square. ""People are walking lighter, standing taller and are reaching out to one another. It feels like hope. It feels like shared happiness."" Wigal said Obama's inauguration has given residents hope that change actually will happen. ""It's all because of Obama -- we dare to feel positive that we may have actually elected a leader, not just a politician,"" she said. ""There are impromptu progressive dinner parties, cookouts and house parties. We finally feel like a real change has come to town."" Obama began his day with a surprise visit to wounded soldiers at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. He met with 14 patients injured in either Iraq or Afghanistan. Obama visited a National Day of Service project, stopping by the Sasha Bruce House, an emergency shelter for homeless teenagers in the Washington area.  Watch Obama speak about service on the eve of his inauguration » . The shelter provides a variety of services, including counseling, job training, and substance abuse prevention assistance, for up to 15 teenagers at a time. Roughly 30 teenagers are spending the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. holiday volunteering at the shelter by helping to renovate a dorm room. Obama rolled up his sleeves and pitched in during the visit, using a roller to help paint a couple of walls and a piece of furniture. He also quoted King to the teenagers, noting that ""everybody can be great [because] everybody can serve."" ""Don't underestimate the power of people who join together to accomplish amazing things,"" Obama added. Given the crisis America is currently in, ""we can't allow any idle hands. Everybody's got to pitch in."" Wigal said Obama's actions and words make her believe the president-elect has the skills needed to help the country move forward. ""Those of us who live and work here, who try to create, shape, influence and move policy forward, are feeling as if we can finally do something that'll result in forward motion,"" Wigal said. ""We believe we have a leader who listens to those who work the issues every day and know the real solutions."" For Wigal, that's exactly what makes Inauguration Day so important. ""Tomorrow is going to be the biggest day in our country's history since its creation,"" she said. During Monday's activities Obama also cited the heroics of U.S. Airways pilot Chesley Sullenberger, who safely landed a crippled commercial airliner in the Hudson River last Thursday, saving the lives of all 155 people on board. ""If everybody did their job as well as he did [his] job, we would be in pretty good shape,"" Obama said. Obama has personally invited Sullenberger to the inauguration. Obama later joined Vice President-elect Joe Biden at a high school where students were making blankets and greeting cards, among other things, for soldiers overseas. Speaking to the students, Obama again invoked King's memory, noting the slain civil rights leader had ""dedicated his life to working at the grassroots level ... on behalf of justice and equality."" ""I am making a commitment to you, as your next president, that we are going to make government work,"" Obama said. But, he warned, ""government can only do so much. If we're just waiting around for someone else to do it for us ... it never gets done. We're going to have to take responsibility, all of us."" Incoming first lady Michelle Obama, joined by Jill Biden, the wife of the vice president-elect, spent the morning at a separate volunteer service event at RFK Stadium, where people were assembling care packages for soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. Martin Luther King Jr. Day is traditionally viewed as a day to encourage greater volunteerism.","NEW: John McCain: President-elect ""has my sincere best wishes for his success""

"(CNN) -- Japan is grappling with its worst economic crisis since the end of World War II, the nation's economic and fiscal policy minister said Monday. A businessman walks past a homeless man taking a nap at a Tokyo park. The comments from Kaoru Yosano followed news of Japan's gross domestic product falling 12.7 percent in the fourth quarter in 2008. ""This is the worst economic crisis in the post-war era,"" Yosano said at a press conference, according to Japan's Kyodo news agency. The global economic crisis has pummeled Japan, which depends largely on its auto and electronics exports. The slump in exports has led to tens of thousands of layoffs across Japan. ""Behind [the contraction in GDP for] the October-December quarter is a terrific downturn in exports,"" he said, according to Kyodo. ""Like other major countries, our country cannot avoid the pains of structural change,"" Yosano said. To stimulate the economy, the Japanese parliament needs to act quickly on key budget measures, he said, referring to bills related to a second supplementary budget for fiscal 2008 and early passage of the state budget for fiscal 2009. Asked about Japan possibly producing a new economic stimulus plan in the short term, Yosano said wide-ranging discussions would be needed first. ""After seeing this level [of GDP], it is our duty to think of various policy options,"" he added.","Economic and fiscal policy minister says worst economic crisis since end of WWII .

"AURORA, Colorado (CNN) -- In her best year as a mortgage broker, Laura Glick says she made ""six figures."" This week she was one of more than 1,200 people attending a job fair and applying for one of 150 jobs paying between $7 and $12 an hour at a new Kohl's department store in a Denver, Colorado, suburb. Laura Glick says she has a good resume but even getting an interview is difficult. She has been out of work for seven months and never thought it would take her this long to find a job. It's not the kind of job she thought she would be applying for, but she has a case of the jitters just the same. ""Your heart starts to race, and you get nervous even though it is not some big job like you used to have,"" she said. ""I'll take anything at this point."" Glick is not alone. Many other people have lost their jobs in this tough economy. A record number of jobless claims was set last month, when first-time claims hit a 26-year high of 589,000 claims in one week. Last week's claims also broke the half-million mark, 524,000, according to a new government report cited on CNNMoney.com. Glick, 29, has been living on about $1400 a month in unemployment benefits, barely enough to cover her rent and health insurance. To get by she has stopped eating out, given up cigarettes and has stopped taking her pets to the vet for regular checkups. ""Its feels very degrading, some of the places I'm applying,"" Glick said. ""It's really difficult, and its hard to stay positive, but that's the only way you're going to get something is staying positive. And I'm hoping everything happens for a reason and the doors that have been closed are going to be the ones that lead to open ones.""  Watch could you be an entrepreneur » . Job seekers have been pouring into a hotel ballroom all week for one of the prized jobs. They fill out paperwork and then are taken up to a hotel room in groups of ten or so. The beds have been removed from the room, and they sit in a circle while store managers holding clipboards ask questions. Most are told they will hear back within three weeks. But some get word right away. ""Hey guess what. I got the job,"" exclaimed Rebecca Erickson, speaking to her mother on her cell phone. When the other applicants filed out the managers asked her to stay behind and offered her a job. She was so excited she forgot to ask how much the job pays. ""It's only part-time, but I'll take it. There's always room for advancement, and with it being a new store opening you never know, a full-time position may open up,"" she said. Erickson, a 31-year old single mother of three, has been unemployed for about two months and has been supporting her family on about $1400 a month in unemployment benefits and food stamps. ""It's awesome; It's great; I love it,"" she said. ""To know that I got a job and they have had over a thousand applications come in for this job, and to know that I am the one to get it is just awesome."" A store opening such as this one is rare. With unemployment at 7.2 percent nationwide and retail sales down for six straight months, there are more going-out-of-business signs than grand-opening signs. Most of the applicants came alone, but a set of identical twins came here as a team. ""Where ever he goes, I go,"" said Jeri Hines, here with his brother Jerell. The 23-year-olds seem to always have a smile on their faces and insist on working together.

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN)  -- A newspaper advertisement for a Miami car dealership reads more like a coupon for bags of potato chips: ""Buy one, get two!"" It's estimated that 900 automotive dealerships will have shut their doors by year's end. The ad speaks to the desperation of car dealers as Big Three auto manufacturers beg Washington for billions in bailout dollars to combat sales that keep dipping to all-time lows. ""The first thing people think when they come in is, 'It's a fake ad. It's a normal car dealer ad. It's a gimmick.' But it's not,"" said Ali Ahmed, sales manager at Rob Lambdin's University Dodge in Miami. To be fair, there is a catch to the buy-one-get-one-free offer: You must first buy a new Dodge truck at full retail price before you're eligible to receive a second truck for about $3,000 in tax, tags and dealer fees. ""We've been fielding phone calls and e-mail inquiries from every state in the country looking to get this buy-one-get-one deal,"" Ahmed said. About 700 dealerships, most of them selling cars from U.S. automakers, have shut their doors since the beginning of the year. The number is expected to hit 900 by year's end. Last month, National Automobile Dealers Association Chairwoman Annette Sykora told the House Financial Services Committee some 19,700 dealerships will still be around by the end of 2008, compared with 50,000 in the 1940s. Auto sales are at a 15-year low, she said, which affects more than the Big Three automakers. Dealers are slashing personnel and expenses. Sykora herself has had to cut staff by about 20 percent at her dealerships, she said. iReport.com: Ask the automakers your questions . Sykora, a third-generation car saleswoman who sells Big Three automobiles at dealerships in Slaton and Levelland, Texas, said she recently sat down with the superintendent of Slaton schools. ""We started discussing what would happen if the dealerships in my hometown were to close,"" she said during her November 19 testimony. ""The loss of tax revenue would force them to cut programs and teachers. ""Many displaced dealership families might have to leave town in search of work in other places, compounding the loss. This same scene would play out in hundreds of communities in the U.S."" Dealerships, Sykora explained, are independent businesses, not arms of the automakers. They invest in land, equipment, buildings and take out millions of dollars in loans to put the vehicles on their lots and showroom floors. She also said car dealerships are a prime source of advertising revenue for local media, they support charities and Little League teams and they are integral to the tax base, she said. ""One-fifth of the nation's retail purchases are automobiles. By getting automotive retailing back on track, Congress can effectively leverage the economic engine of the automobile industry to get this economy running on all cylinders again,"" she said, pleading with Congress not to let the Big Three file for bankruptcy.  Watch what the automakers are asking for » . With the world's economy reeling, expensive items like cars are not high priorities for families and businesses. It doesn't help that the credit crunch is making it difficult to get loans, which the majority of U.S. consumers need to purchase vehicles. Also compounding matters is consumer confidence, which hit an all-time low in October and didn't improve much in November, according to the nonprofit Conference Board, which maintains indices on consumers' trust in the marketplace. According to Autodata, car sales have plummeted since last year. In the United States, the number of sales of passenger cars and light trucks in November 2008 was down 36.7 percent from November 2007 -- from about 1.18 million to 747,000. Also, as of November 2008, automakers had sold about 12.35 million cars and light trucks, compared with 14.76 million during the same time period last year -- a drop of 16.3 percent, according to Autodata's summary of U.S. light vehicle retail sales. Comparing November 2008 sales with those in November 2007, Autodata reported that General Motors saw a 41.3 percent drop, Ford a 30.5 percent drop and Chrysler 47.1 percent. But it's not just U.S. automakers taking a hit: Toyota's vehicle sales declined 33.9 percent, Honda's dipped 31.6 percent and Nissan's dropped 42.2 percent during that time period, Autodata reported. ""It's definitely a tough climate right now,"" said Matt Lee, floor manager for Major World Auto in New York. ""A lot of people are saying it's a perfect storm of gas prices and financing and consumer confidence."" Major World Auto used to sell about 150 cars a month. It now sells about half that, Lee said. And of the 15 to 20 salespeople who used to roam the salesroom floor, about 10 are left, he said. ""Salesmen actually just walked out because they're not making enough money to support their family,"" he said. Major World has stopped bringing in new models because it can't sell the cars it has. Like University Dodge in Miami, it is resorting to some creative sales pitches, including zero-percent financing for 72 months and rebates of up to $7,500. But even with the bargains, car dealers are having trouble getting customers into the showrooms. In a recent CNN visit to Major World, which lasted about two hours, only one customer walked onto the lot -- to browse. ""Where you would see five people a day coming in to at least look at a car per salesmen, you're getting maybe one person a day or two people a day,"" salesman Jamie Krinsky said. If the Big Three file for bankruptcy, Sykora told Congress last month, sales and confidence will continue to plummet. ""Imagine how banks would react to a dealer who has asked for millions of dollars to finance new and used inventories from an automaker going through 'reorganization,' "" she said.   Watch whether a bailout would come too late for dealers » . The government can help boost auto sales in many ways, Sykora said, citing two proposed tax incentives: one that would make interest payments on car loans tax deductible and another that would encourage consumers to upgrade their older cars for more fuel-efficient models. ""Cash for clunkers"" programs are in place in Texas and California, she said. ""Whether it's my dealerships in Texas or it's the dealership in your community, the fact is local dealerships will be a major factor in our economic recovery,"" she told the House committee. ""To get the economy back on track, we must restore consumer demand, and the only way to do that is to restore consumer confidence."" CNN's Alina Cho and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.","Dealer: Dealerships to dwindle to 19,700 by 2009, compared with 50,000 in 1940s .

"(CNN) -- Rick Warren -- the man at the center of an inaugural firestorm -- has built his career on an uncontroversial reputation. President-elect Barack Obama has chosen Rick Warren to deliver the invocation at his inauguration. The irony of the furor over Warren's selection to deliver the invocation at Barack Obama's inaugural ceremony is that the California minister first drew notice for his determination to expand the evangelical agenda beyond hot-button social issues like opposition to same-sex marriage. Warren has been described as the next Billy Graham, an evangelical leader with a moderate reputation and mass-market appeal -- although instead of massive open-air rallies and an out-sized television presence, Warren focused on forging partnerships with unlikely allies working to protect the environment and fight AIDS. As a pioneer of the mega-church movement, Warren looked to translate traditional evangelical messages for a wider audience. He penned ""The Purpose-Driven Life,"" a spiritually based self-help guide that brought mainstream best-seller status to a muted religious message. In his model, everyday concerns were a top priority: Attendees at his Saddleback Church -- now more than 20,000 strong -- could expect free classes on home finance, or assistance with child care needs. Warren urged ministers to adopt a Madison Avenue approach: to super-charge the growth of congregations by fine-tuning their pitch for the ""un-churched."" He released bullet-point sermons with crossover potential, along with material to help churchgoers follow along. The church atmosphere he called for was a relaxed one, with dressed-down ministers leading services in nontraditional venues, featuring easy-listening music chosen with younger listeners in mind. But even as Warren's nonpartisan appeal led to increasingly high-profile roles -- like host of this summer's presidential faith forum, featuring Sens. Obama and John McCain -- controversy grew over his conservative stands on social issues. The headlines may be new, but Warren's positions aren't. During the last election cycle, he sent thousands of pastors an e-mail laying out what he viewed as non-negotiable issues for evangelicals deciding on their pick at the polls, from stem-cell research and abortion to same-sex marriage. On Wednesday, after Obama announced Warren as his choice, prominent liberal groups and gay rights proponents criticized the selection. Some said the choice signaled that Obama is not interested in advancing gay rights or protecting abortion rights.  iReport.com: What do you think of the choice? Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said Wednesday that he feels a ""deep level of disrespect"" because of the choice of Warren and is calling on Obama to reconsider the move. Read more about the criticism of Obama's choice . On Thursday, Obama defended his decision to tap Warren. ""And I would note that a couple of years ago, I was invited to Rick Warren's church to speak, despite his awareness that I held views that were entirely contrary to his when it came to gay and lesbian rights, when it came to issues like abortion. ... ""And that dialogue, I think, is part of what my campaign's been all about: That we're not going to agree on every single issue, but what we have to do is to be able to create an atmosphere ... where we can disagree without being disagreeable and then focus on those things that we hold in common as Americans."" But progressive commentators said Warren is a symbol of division. ""When Obama advances a progressive agenda on social issues, as he's certain to do, Warren will continue to speak out on the other side,"" wrote the Washington Monthly's Steve Benen. ""Only now, he'll do so with the added authority that comes with being the president's hand-chosen pastor for the inauguration's invocation. Warren's status will soar, and his criticism of Obama's policies -- or Democrats' in general -- will resonate that much louder."" Warren himself is working to contain the fallout from his support for California's Proposition 8. In an interview set to air this week, he denied that his stand against same-sex marriage meant he was homophobic. ""Of course not. I have always treated them with respect,"" he said. ""When they come and wanna talk to me, I talk to 'em. When the protesters came, we served them water and doughnuts.""","Pastor Rick Warren first drew notice for trying to expand past hot-button issues .

"(CNN)  -- Numerous wildfires were roaring Thursday through parts of Oklahoma and Texas, engulfing one town and searing neighborhoods in others, including one in Oklahoma City. Hurricane-force winds continued to kick the flames even higher. Firefighters in Bowie, Texas, try to get a grass fire under control. Bowie is about 70 miles northwest of Fort Worth. The fires had engulfed so many miles of turf, and flying embers had sparked in so many different places, that hours after the first blazes were reported Thursday morning, safety officials still weren't sure how many fires they were facing. In Texas, the 100-person town of Stoneburg was ""burned over,"" by a 25,000-acre fire said Texas Forest Service spokeswoman Misty Wilburn. The town, northwest of Dallas near the Oklahoma state line, had been evacuated, she said. Seventy-five to 100 homes had been destroyed in Oklahoma, and 13 people were confirmed injured -- two of them critically, according to emergency officials.  Watch homes in Oklahoma burn » . Wilburn said Texas authorities were working at least nine major fires Thursday evening, seven in the west of the state and two in the north. ""Everything we have is committed to fires,"" she said. ""Everyone is maxed out."" Feeding the flames were strong winds that were gusting as high as 76 mph, the strength of a Category 1 hurricane,  and grounding many emergency aircraft that can't fly safely in those conditions. On the southwest side of Oklahoma City, fires had engulfed eight homes, and were believed to be destroying many more. In Choctaw, Oklahoma, dozens of homes had been destroyed, and the high school was on the verge of burning, police dispatcher Silva Schneider said just before 8 p.m. Aerial video footage of the central Oklahoma city of about 9,000 people showed row after row of houses in several different neighborhoods engulfed in flames. The Oklahoma towns of Velma, Sparks, Wellston, Healdton and Midwest City, a suburb of Oklahoma City, had all been ordered into mandatory evacuations because of the fires, which officials say are finding plenty of easy fuel because of dry conditions throughout the Southwest. ""It's a bad day in Oklahoma,"" said Albert Ashwood, director of the state's emergency management department. Grass fires were being reported west of the Dallas-Fort Worth area, with the smell of smoke already wafting through the cities. Ashwood said weather experts fear that heavy winds as night falls could drive the wildfires into more heavily populated areas. A spokesman for the Texas Forest Service said fires in the state were burning in numerous counties in areas near Fort Worth, Wichita Falls and Amarillo.  Watch video of wildfires in Bowie, Texas » . He said there were so many blazes that firefighters were having to ignore some of them, and that winds were so high that most fire-fighting aircraft were unable to fly. The National Weather Service had categorized much of Texas and Oklahoma an ""extremely critical fire weather area"" Thursday because of the dry conditions and winds. Large portions of western and central Texas and western Oklahoma are in a drought, according to the service. A firefighter who was working near Lindsey, Oklahoma, was in critical condition with third-degree burns over 35 percent of his body, according to a hospital spokeswoman. A motorist in Oklahoma also was hospitalized after driving into an area with heavy smoke, authorities said. iReport.com: Are wildfires affecting you? While the blazes seemed overwhelming in spots, firefighters were making some progress on some fronts. In Breckenridge, Texas, a fire that started in an old landfill and burned several hundred acres had been contained just north of the city limits, according to fire officials. But even as that blaze came under control, the fire department received reports of another fire. Wilburn said that as nightfall approached, Texas had been able to get some firefighting aircraft in the air and that five of the fires were at least partially contained.

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN)  -- Zimbabwe's prime minister believes the driver of the truck that struck his car, killing his wife, deliberately drove toward them, his party told CNN. Morgan Tsvangirai leaves the hospital Saturday after being treated for injuries from a car crash. Members of his political party, the Movement for Democratic Change, and former U.S. diplomat also say the crash raises suspicions of foul play. The prime minister left a hospital Saturday, a day after his wife, Susan, was killed in the collision, officials said. A ball cap covered Tsvangirai's bandaged head. Tsvangirai was taken to a hospital in Gaborone, Botswana, on Saturday for medical treatment, a Botswanan government source and a source with the prime minister's party. ""He's badly bruised and is receiving treatment,"" the Botswanan government source said. The source with the prime minister's party said Tsvangirai will return to Zimbabwe on Wednesday to attend the funeral of his wife. The couple, who were married in 1978, have six children. The crash happened on a two-lane highway between Tsvangirai's hometown, Buhera, and the capital, Harare. It comes only weeks after the start of a power-sharing agreement between Tsvangirai and his political rival, President Robert Mugabe. Tsvangirai's political party said Friday that it was too early to tell whether the crash was anything other than an accident. But on Saturday, MDC members told CNN that Tsvangirai thought the crash was deliberate. Tendai Biti, the MDC secretary-general, speaking during a tearful press conference, said Tsvangirai should have had better security.  Watch how the accident threatens to derail the unity government » . ""If there had been a police escort maybe what happened yesterday could have not have happened,"" Biti said. ""(A) police escort would have warned oncoming vehicles of a VIP arriving. I think authorities must understand the omission. ""We hope that this omission will be rectified, that the prime minister must be given the protection that ought to be accorded to a prime minister."" Biti said the MDC would launch its own investigation. Analysts say the crash raises suspicions of foul play. One former U.S. diplomat called for an outside investigation, saying it was not the first time one of Mugabe's political foes had been killed or injured in a car crash. Tsvangirai, Zimbabwe's main opposition leader, took office last month under a power-sharing deal with Mugabe following a contentious election. The MDC reached the agreement with Mugabe in September after months of angry dispute that included violence. More than 200 deaths, mainly opposition supporters, were reported leading up to and after the election. ""I'm skeptical about any motor vehicle accident in Zimbabwe involving an opposition figure,"" said Tom McDonald, the U.S. ambassador to Zimbabwe from 1997 to 2001. ""President Mugabe has a history of strange car accidents when someone lo and behold dies -- it's sort of his M.O., of how they get rid of people they don't like.""  Watch more on the fatal crash » . McDonald cited the car crash deaths of Defense Minister Moven Mahachi in 2001, Employment Minister Border Gezi in 1999 and Elliot Manyika, a government minister and former regional governor, last year. ""So when I hear that Tsvangirai was in an accident, it gives me pause,"" McDonald said. Now an attorney with the Washington law firm Baker Hostetler, he urged a full independent investigation. However, he added that traffic accidents are common in Zimbabwe. The highway Tsvangirai was traveling on was only two lanes and tractor-trailers were common, McDonald said. Vehicles in the country were often in bad shape and drivers inexperienced. ""It's certainly plausible that this was just one of those tragic things,"" he said.

"Editor's Note: John Kerry, a Democrat, is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the junior senator from Massachusetts. John Kerry says Barack Obama sent a message that fight against terror will respect America's values. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Thursday was an important day for the rule of law in the United States of America. With a handful of signatures to executive orders, President Obama ordered the eventual closure of Guantanamo Bay prison and CIA ""black site"" prisons, and placed interrogation in all American facilities by all U.S. personnel under the guidelines of the Army Field Manual. In a season of transformational changes, these are among the most meaningful, because they send a powerful message that America's struggle against terrorism will once against honor some of the most cherished ideals of our republic: respect for the rule of law, individual rights, and America's moral leadership. The president understands all too well that the threat our nation faces from terrorism is all too real. And we should all agree that sometimes, in the name of national security, it is necessary to make difficult ethical decisions to protect the American people. However, I and many others believe that the use of torture and indefinite detention have not only tarnished our honor but also diminished our security. In this global counterinsurgency effort against al Qaeda and its allies, too often our means have undercut our efforts by wasting one of our best weapons: the legitimacy that comes from our moral authority. Torture plays directly into a central tenet of al Qaeda's recruiting pitch: that everyday Muslims across the world have something to fear from the United States of America. From Morocco to Malaysia, people regularly hear stories of torture and suicide at Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo, and other overseas prisons. The result has been a major blow to our credibility worldwide, particularly where we need it most: in the Muslim world. Once permitted, torture and lawlessness are not easily contained. Coercive interrogation techniques found their way from high-level terrorists at Guantanamo to low-level detainees at Abu Ghraib. Years later, images of abuse there remain fixtures across the Arab and Muslim world. And as John McCain has argued, the use of techniques like waterboarding leaves its scars on a democratic society as well. Torture elicits lies -- not just from those experiencing it, but from those who seek to conceal it. After years of Orwellian denials and legalistic parsing, what a relief it was to hear our new attorney general-designee finally acknowledge what we know to be true: that yes, ""waterboarding is torture."" As we move forward, President Obama is wise to ""reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals"" -- but the American people should know that closing a prison conceived outside the rule of law will not be easy. Reclaiming Guantanamo and its inhabitants into our legal system from what former Vice President Dick Cheney called ""the dark side"" will be an enormous challenge and a thicket of thorny legal and policy issues. However, we are already seeing the international system reorganize itself around an America that is willing to be a moral leader. Countries such as Portugal and Ireland have made welcome offers to join Albania in resettling detainees who cannot be returned to their home countries. Already we are seeing the fruits of a good faith effort with our allies. Still, it will take time and effort to overcome numerous hurdles, many handed over from the previous administration: looming questions about the inadmissibility of evidence improperly coerced; the difficulty of returning detainees -- including many cleared for departure -- who would face torture or worse in their home countries; and the fact that we already know some released from Guantanamo have returned to the battlefield. In some cases we simply lack evidence to charge men we know to be extremely dangerous to the American people. And even as we embrace long-overdue change, we owe it even to those we believe made grave mistakes to acknowledge the urgency of the moment they inherited, the sacred responsibility to protect American lives which they strove to honor, and the humbling reality that there are no easy answers when it comes to such life-and-death matters. But the American story is one of perfectibility and striving for ever-greater fidelity to our ideals -- it is a journey from colony to republic, from slavery to freedom, from sexism to suffrage, from stark poverty to shared prosperity. The president himself famously said, ""The union may never be perfect, but generation after generation has shown that it can always be perfected."" It is true that today we face unprecedented, unorthodox, and vastly destructive enemies that respect neither borders nor rules of war. But this is not the first new challenge America has evolved to meet. Sometimes that evolution requires us to admit mistakes, learn from them and grow as a nation. The desire to do better has always been a core part of America's greatness. Last week Barack Obama and his administration wrote a new chapter in that old story. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Kerry.","John Kerry: Barack Obama's early decisions were victories for rule of law .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Pirates in ships are searching for the lifeboat containing four pirates and their hostage -- the captain of a freighter they failed to hijack earlier this week -- according to a U.S. military official with knowledge of the situation. Capt. Richard Phillips of the Maersk Alabama is being held by pirates on a lifeboat off Somalia. The pirates are using ships they have already hijacked and larger ships from which they are launching skiffs, the official said Friday. One of the pirated ships is the German cargo ship Hansa Stavanger, seized April 4 off the coast of Somalia. The U.S. military has been monitoring communications between the pirates, the official said. The guided missile frigate USS Halyburton, with helicopter capabilities, has now joined the guided missile destroyer USS Bainbridge in the area. A third ship, the amphibious assault ship USS Boxer, which has a large medical facility on board, will be there within a day. Richard Phillips, the hostage, tried to escape from the pirates Thursday night by jumping out of the lifeboat, a U.S. official said Friday.  Watch what it's like inside a lifeboat » . Phillips was believed to be trying to swim to the USS Bainbridge, which is in communication with the four gunmen holding Phillips in the 28-foot boat off Somalia's coast, the official said. Some of the kidnappers jumped into the water, recaptured Phillips, and returned him to the lifeboat, according to the official.  Watch what happened when captain tried to escape » . The pirates fired shots, the military official said, but had no further details. A Defense Department official told CNN that Phillips appeared to be tied up by the pirates after the escape attempt. The U.S. official -- who did not want to be named because of the sensitive nature of the situation -- said the escape attempt is being viewed by negotiators as an ""optimistic sign"" that Phillips is in good health. He has been held since Wednesday, when the hijackers seized control of his U.S.-flagged ship, the Maersk Alabama.  Watch expert talk about hostage escape attempts » . The captain's wife Andrea Phillips thanked everyone for their support in a statement. ""My husband is a strong man and we will remain strong for him,"" she said. ""We ask that you do the same. "" Phillips' 20-man crew regained control of the vessel, and they and the vessel are en route to Mombasa, Kenya, according to the father of one of the crew members. The ship's owners -- the Norfolk, Virginia-based Maersk company -- would not say how the crew regained control. ""There will be time for due diligence and retrospective review once we have the safe return of all parties and the opportunity for a full debriefing,"" it said in a statement. For the U.S. Navy, the show of strength is more than just a means to resolve a hostage situation, said Chris Lawrence, CNN's Pentagon correspondent. Attacks in the area have picked up so drastically in recent months that the Navy has to reposition some of its fleet to deal with the threats, he said. iReport.com: How should the U.S. respond? The pirates have shown no signs of giving in. The Maersk Alabama was on its way to Mombasa, Kenya, with a cargo of food aid when it was attacked Wednesday. It was the first time in recent history that pirates had targeted an American ship. The ship was hijacked some 350 miles off Somalia's coast, a distance that used to be considered safe for ships navigating in the pirate-infested waters.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President Obama declared Monday that his stimulus plan is ""starting to work"" and that 2,000 transportation projects -- costing much less than expected -- are under way. President Obama on Monday says the transportation projects will help create or save jobs. ""Competition for these projects is so fierce, and contractors are doing such a good job cutting costs, the projects are consistently coming in under budget,"" Obama said Monday. The president gave a rapid-fire list of savings: a bid for road work in Connecticut is $8.4 million less than the state budgeted; Louisiana has a project coming in $4.7 million less than expected; projects in Colorado are averaging about 30 percent under the state forecast; and some bids in California are nearly half of what the state projected. The administration said those savings will stretch the agency's $48 billion stimulus budget. ""Our recovery dollars can go further, and we can do more projects,"" said Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said. ""This is great news."" LaHood hosted the president and vice president at his department's headquarters in Washington for the  announcement. Officials did not give an overall estimate of money saved from competitive bids. The three leaders also claimed a victory in the amount of transportation work approved so far, saying the agency has approved its 2,000th infrastructure project as part of the stimulus. ""Some may have thought it would have taken months to get to this point,"" Obama said, ""but we have approved these projects in just 41 days.""  Watch as Obama says projects are coming in ahead of schedule » . The stimulus bill was signed February 17, but transportation dollars did not begin flowing until later. The president said the 2,000th transportation project to receive stimulus funds is one to widen and add an overpass to a stretch of Interstate 94 near Portage, Michigan. Vice President Joseph Biden plans to attend the groundbreaking in June. Obama said the highway projects from the stimulus bill will create or save 150,000 jobs by the end of next year. He pointed to the aggressive contractor interest in transportation projects, along with tax cuts going to millions of families from the stimulus plan, and implied it marks a turning point in the economic recovery effort.

"(CNN) -- Todd Palin and nine aides were found in contempt Friday by the Alaska Senate for failing to appear to testify in the Legislature's ""troopergate"" investigation of his wife, Gov. Sarah Palin, a spokeswoman for the Alaska Democratic Party said. Todd Palin, shown campaigning in Virginia in 2008,  didn't testify, but submitted a statement in the case. But a Senate resolution said no one should be punished, because the 10 did submit statements to the investigator, the Anchorage Daily News reported. The governor's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The investigation concerns the governor's firing of the state's public safety commissioner, Walter Monegan. A bipartisan commission in the state Legislature investigated allegations that Palin fired Monegan after he refused to sack her ex-brother-in-law, State Trooper Mike Wooten. The governor, first elected in 2006, has denied wrongdoing. In court papers, Palin called her sister's ex-husband a ""rogue trooper"" who threatened the governor's family during a bitter divorce and custody battle. Complaints from Palin's family led to a five-day suspension for the trooper in 2006 after his superiors found he had illegally shot a moose using his wife's permit, drove his patrol car while drinking beer and used a Taser on his 10-year-old stepson ""in a training capacity."" In an interview last year, Wooten said, ""I made mistakes. I 'fessed up to them. I was punished appropriately, and I'm moving on."" Palin was Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona's running mate in his unsuccessful campaign last year for U.S. president.","Todd Palin, nine aides found in contempt by Alaska Senate for failing to appear .

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- If anybody had a reason to doubt whether Tyler Perry has become one of the most bankable brands in all of movies, be skeptical no longer. The domestic dramedy maestro's latest release, Tyler Perry's ""Madea Goes to Jail,"" ran away with a big victory on the typically slow Academy Awards weekend, grossing a hefty $41.1 million, according to early estimates from Media by Numbers. That opening sum is the biggest of all time for a Tyler Perry film, besting the $30 million debut of 2006's ""Madea's Family Reunion."" Too, it's the top bow in the history of indie studio Lionsgate, improving upon all the Tyler Perry and ""Saw"" flicks that came before it. The movie's per-theater average of $20,236 ranks in the top 40 for all wide openers ever. And, no surprise, ""Madea Goes to Jail"" achieved all this success with a solid A CinemaScore grade from a crowd that included mostly older women.  Watch Tyler Perry talk about his success » . Second place went to ""Taken,"" which added another $11.4 million to its four-week tally, bringing said total to $95.2 million. Fellow strong holdover ""Coraline"" (No. 3) was next with $11 million. ""He's Just Not That Into You"" (No. 4) declined a sharp 56 percent to bank $8.5 million on its third weekend. And Best Picture favorite ""Slumdog Millionaire"" rounded out the top five with $8.1 million -- a sum that brings its domestic total to $98 million. Reigning champ ""Friday the 13th"" suffered one of the biggest drops ever, a stunning 81 percent, to finish in sixth place with $7.8 million. And this weekend's other major new release, the cheerleader comedy ""Fired Up!"" (No. 9), grossed a weak-but-expected $6 million. The film garnered an okay CinemaScore grade of B from a crowd comprised of mostly younger ladies. Overall, the weekend was up nearly 30 percent over the same frame a year ago, when ""Vantage Point"" led the way. Eight of the past nine weekends have improved upon the previous year's grosses. And I'd be remiss if I didn't take a quick peek at the main Oscar contenders, for whom the box office report is mixed headed into the ceremony. ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" leads the way with $124.2 million. The aforementioned ""Slumdog Millionaire"" should clear the $100 million mark in the next several days, whether it wins the top prize or not. Then it's a big jump down to ""Milk"" ($28.2 million), ""The Reader"" ($23.2 million), and ""Frost/Nixon"" ($17.4 million).

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The romantic comedy ""New In Town"" puts co-stars Renee Zellweger and Harry Connick Jr. at odds through most of the film. But behind the camera, the story was completely different, the pair told CNN. Harry Connick Jr. and Renee Zellweger enjoyed working with one another on the set of ""New In Town."" ""I had a great time. [Connick is] such a nice guy. He shows up on set and makes everyone laugh, and it's just a nice day at work,"" Zellweger said. Connick agreed, saying the off-camera friendship with his co-star made the on-camera experience an enjoyable one. ""Renee is the type of person that I got to know quickly. Well, I became friends with her quickly. She's a very mysterious, wonderful young lady,"" Connick said. Directed by Jonas Elmer, the film follows Zellweger as Lucy Hill, a Miami, Florida-based corporate shark who travels to a small Minnesota town to oversee the closing of a small factory. Upon arrival, Lucy clashes with the factory's union representative, Ted Mitchell, played by Connick. As the two begin to understand one another, their icy relationship soon melts into romance. But the romance between Lucy and Ted is only one side of the story. Zellweger said she was instantly drawn to the role for its humor. ""I loved the physical comedy part of Lucy Hill's experience. I laughed out loud when I imagined the scenarios, and I could not wait to go and play around with that,"" she said, ""I wanted to go to work every day and laugh, and I did."" Famous for her roles in such comedies as ""Nurse Betty"" and ""Bridget Jones's Diary,"" Zellweger is no stranger to the comedic scene. With ""New In Town,"" the actress was eager to once again play a part that would make audiences laugh. ""I think the laughter, that's therapeutic,"" she said. At a time when the country is struggling through a financial recession, Connick said, ""New In Town"" provides that necessary therapy. While the film centers on the troubles of one rural American town, it showcases a dilemma familiar to the entire country. ""I think there's a good balance of what people are really feeling right now, and you walk away from this movie with a real feeling of hope and like, 'We're going to be all right,'"" he said.

"(CNN) -- A 24-year-old teacher from Holyoke, Massachusetts, is in custody after allegedly leaving town with a 15-year-old student, city officials said Tuesday. Lisa Lavoie, a 24-year-old teacher, is charged with enticement of a child. Lisa Lavoie and the male student were found in Morgantown, West Virginia, Monday night after apparently being together for a week, Holyoke Mayor Michael Sullivan said. Investigators have charged Lavoie with enticement of a child. On February 13, the student's parents informed school officials of a possible relationship between the teacher and their son. That was late on a Friday afternoon, and when officials went to the school to question Lavoie, she was gone for the day. The next week was a vacation week for the school. The student was reported missing on February 16, at the start of the vacation week. Lavoie wasn't reported missing until she didn't show up for school Monday. Officials said the pair were in Vermont on Thursday before showing up in West Virginia on Monday. No details were provided on how their alleged movements were traced. Officials couldn't take the pair into custody until after gathering enough evidence to obtain a warrant from the district attorney's office, said Holyoke Police Chief Anthony Scott. They got the warrant Monday and asked police in Morgantown to arrest Lavoie. She has been placed on administrative leave pending conclusion of the investigation, Sullivan said. If convicted, Lavoie could lose her teaching license in Massachusetts, the mayor said. She has been with the school only five months and her job is not protected under contract, he said.","A missing teacher and her 15-year-old student were found in West Virginia Monday .

"(CNN) -- David Beckham was upstaged on the day his AC Milan future was finally resolved as teammate Filippo Inzaghi fired a hat-trick in the 3-0 success over Atalanta at the San Siro on Sunday. David Beckham congratulates hat-trick hero Filippo Inzaghi as the San Siro enjoys a double celebration. Milan confirmed in a brief statement a deal had been reached with Los Angeles Galaxy over England international Beckham. ""AC Milan announces that the player David Beckham will remain at the club until June 30, 2009,"" it read. The 33-year-old midfielder will then return to the United States to play for the Galaxy between July and October. ""I'm grateful to both clubs for allowing this dream to come true,"" Beckham said in a statement posted on www.gazzetta.it. What do think of Beckham's move to play in the U.S. and Italy? ""It will enable me to play for Milan and the Galaxy in the same season, with the possibility of been able to keep up my commitments with Major League Soccer and the development of soccer in the United States, something which I'm very passionate about."" The deal follows weeks of negotiations between the two clubs during which Milan baulked at the size of the transfer fee Galaxy were demanding -- thought to be around £12million. Galaxy's chief executive, Tim Lieweke, admits the deal is one which suits both clubs. ""I'm sorry that it had to go for so long, for him and for us and particularly for the fans,"" he told the Los Angeles Times. ""This is a good solution. It allows him to finish the season with Milan. We will see him in July."" Coach Carlo Ancelotti admits Beckham has exceeded all expectations during his first two months as an AC Milan player. ""Beckham has done more than we could have possibly expected from him,"" Ancelotti told PA Sport. ""He has settled in very well with the squad and given a huge contribution up to now. ""He is very professional and we are all very, very happy that he is staying."" He added: ""The aim was to keep him until June 30 and we have done that. He is very happy with the solution that has been found and we will make the most of having him now and then we will see."" Sunday's victory gave Milan a five-point gap over fourth-placed Fiorentina, who lost 2-0 at home to Palermo. Ancelotti said Inzaghi had helped lift the club out of a crisis after their UEFA Cup exit. ""He gave us a real helping hand. It was a tough match and for most of the first half Atalanta caused us problems,"" he said. ""Then Pippo's ability to find the right place to be in allowed us to end the match well. We were in a crisis and now I hope that this result has put an end to the crisis."" Only the top three in Serie A will go straight into next season's Champions League group stages with the fourth place finisher having to negotiate two qualifying rounds. With his contract uncertainty behind him, Beckham seemed to have a new lease of life and he was even given a free role behind forwards Inzaghi and Pato by Ancelotti. The former England captain dictated the play and helped open the way for Milan to take a seventh-minute lead when Marek Jankulovski firied across goal for the unmarked Inzaghi to score. Milan had to wait until the 71st minute for Inzaghi's second. He beat the offside trap to latch onto Pato's chip and take the ball around Consigli before slotting home. Moment's later Inzaghi was once again in the right place at the right time to tap in Gianluca Zambrotta's pass from close range. After that Ancelotti took both Inzaghi and Beckham off to give the fans the chance to show their appreciation for both players. There was no change to the top three in Serie A as Inter Milan and Juventus both won on Saturday, 2-0 at Genoa and 1-0 at Torino respectively. Serie A top scorer Marco Di Vaio also scored a hat-trick as Bologna thrashed Sampdoria 3-0.","Filippo Inzaghi fires hat-trick in Milan's 3-0 win over Atalanta at the San Siro .

"Friedrich Nietzsche said, ""Without music, life would be a mistake."" Music is a big part of many people's lives. For some, music is life. Sean Forbes, 26, started a nonprofit called D-PAN, or Deaf Performing Artists Network. But not everyone can have music in their lives, and one man is trying to change that for the deaf community. Sean Forbes, 26, started a nonprofit called D-PAN, or Deaf Performing Artists Network, which creates American Sign Language-enhanced music videos. Forbes spoke with CNN's Nicole Lapin about how D-PAN works. The following is an edited transcript of the interview. Forbes: Really, the story here of how the whole thing came up was, I was in a car with three girls, and I went to school at Rochester Institute of Technology in New York. So we took a road trip to Gallaudet University, and on this trip I was singing all of these songs to my friends. And it's just something I've been doing for a while. So I'm signing all of these songs and all the sudden, a light bulb goes on above my head, when I'm like, wouldn't it be cool if there were music videos with deaf performers in them, signing the song, signing the lyrics of the song.  Watch Nicole Lapin's interview with Sean Forbes » . That was really where the idea started from, and I instantly went back to RIT, and I had a friend make me a video of me signing an Eminem song and that's how the whole thing really started. Lapin: Eminem, Christina Aguilera. You started translating really popular music videos, and tell me about these shoots, because this is a really big production you put on. Forbes: Yeah. I mean, we had hearing and deaf people behind the scenes creating this. We had interpreters; there were probably about 20 people on the production set for these videos. Lapin: What was the reaction from some people in the deaf community that never experienced music before, never experienced it before you and D-PAN? Forbes: For me it was just awesome to see all of these deaf people who have never been involved with music be involved in these videos for the first time. A lot of the people who are in the videos never experienced music before. So for them, it was just an awesome experience, and they were really thrilled to be a part of it. Lapin: And a lot of people on our Web site, CNN.com, are thrilled to be part of your experience, being introduced to your story. A lot of questions also came in; I want to bring some to your attention. Ashley has this question for you Sean. ""Has anyone ever told you that D-PAN would not be successful and if so, how did you respond?"" I'm sure you had some haters out there. Forbes: I've had, you know, I've approached a few situations before where they didn't only tell me that D-PAN wouldn't be successful, but they told me that I would never be successful as a deaf musician. And I always laughed it off, because I knew deep inside of me, this is what I wanted. And I wouldn't let anyone tell me no, I wouldn't take no for an answer. So those people who told me no, look at me now.","Sean Forbes, 26, started a nonprofit called Deaf Performing Artists Network .

"(CNN) -- Staffers at a federal prison in central Florida fired shots to break up a large-scale fight that sent eight inmates to hospital emergency rooms Sunday afternoon, officials said. Eight inmates were injured Sunday in a fight at Coleman Federal Correctional Complex in Florida, officials said. Authorities did not say what led to the fight at the Coleman Federal Correctional Complex in Sumter County. A statement from the prison said one inmate suffered a gunshot wound, but did not say whether the person was struck by a prison staff member's bullet. The other seven were ""stabbing/shooting victims,"" said a spokesman for Orlando Regional Medical Center, where the inmates were taken. The hospital did not elaborate. No prison staffers were seriously hurt in the incident, which the FBI is investigating, said Charles Ratledge, spokesman for the prison. The fight broke out in the recreation yard of the United States Penitentiary No. 2, a high-security facility, about 2:20 p.m. The Coleman complex consists of four institutions. The other three facilities -- another U.S. penitentiary, a medium-security and a low-security facility -- were not affected, said Bureau of Prison spokeswoman Traci Billingsley. ""The inmates ignored staff orders to stop their assaultive behavior, and shots were fired by institution staff to prevent possible loss of life,"" Ratledge said. Five medical evacuation helicopters -- three from the hospital -- landed at the prison and transported the injured inmates on the 15- to 20-minute flight to Orlando Regional, hospital spokesman Joe Brown said. The prison complex is in near Coleman in Sumter County, about 50 miles northwest of Orlando, Florida. The community was never endangered by the fight, U.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Laura Sweeney said.

"(CNN) -- The new district attorney of Boulder County, Colorado, said he plans to take a fresh look at the investigation into the 1996 slaying of JonBenet Ramsey. The DA's office assumed responsibility for the investigation in 2002. But District Attorney Stan Garnett told CNN that he wants to decide during his first 30 days in office whether the case should be returned to Boulder police. ""I'm trying to determine whether it's efficient to have the ongoing investigation handled by my office or somebody else,"" said Garnett, who was sworn in as district attorney January 13. The DA's office is relatively small, he said, with 27 lawyers and six investigators handling between 2,000 and 2,500 felony cases a year. Although the Ramsey case has not generated news since last year, tips and information regularly come in to authorities. Whoever is handling the investigation is charged with checking them out and deciding whether they are worth pursuing, Garnett said. He said reports that he is considering reopening the case are inaccurate. ""It's not closed. It hasn't been solved, and it's been open the whole time."" The case is one of the nation's most famous unsolved murders. On December 26, 1996, John Ramsey discovered the body of his 6-year-old daughter, JonBenet, in the basement of the family's Boulder home. The girl had been strangled and beaten. A ransom note was found on the stairs of the home, demanding $118,000. Early in the case, Boulder police said JonBenet's parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, were under ""an umbrella of suspicion"" in her death. But they were never formally named as suspects, and a grand jury refused to indict them. Patsy Ramsey died in 2006 after a lengthy battle with ovarian cancer. In July, Garnett's predecessor, Mary Lacy, issued a public apology for the suspicion surrounding the Ramsey family after a DNA test performed using new technology showed that DNA found on JonBenet's underwear and under her fingernails belonged to an unidentified man. The test results, Lacy said, were ""powerful evidence"" that allows investigators to think the Ramsey family were victims, not suspects. That same third-party DNA exonerated John Mark Karr, a one-time teacher, after he was arrested in Thailand and brought to Colorado. Authorities said Karr told a University of Colorado professor in e-mails that he was involved in JonBenet's death. He told reporters after his arrest that he was with the child when she died, although he called her death an accident and said he loved her. Lacy was widely criticized, including by then-Gov. Bill Owens, for the handling of Karr's arrest. Boulder police also have long faced criticism over their handling of the investigation. But, Garnett said Friday, ""I've been very impressed by the Boulder P.D. They are a fine department now and have handled a number of cases very well. ... They've done a very nice job."" The department has 24 investigators, four times as many as the DA's staff, he said. Garnett was elected DA in November to replace Lacy, who could not run again because of term limits. Before he was elected, he served as a trial lawyer for 22 years, according to the DA's Web site.","Stan Garnett says he'll take fresh look at JonBenet Ramsey case .

In western Michigan's Berrien County, drivers blinded by blizzard conditions drove into a 30-vehicle pile-up on Interstate 94 on Sunday afternoon. Dozens of other vehicles also were involved in a series of other nearby wrecks, including one that killed a 31-year-old Illinois man, police said. Michigan resident Eric Teschke said he had just told his friend who was driving that they should probably slow down when trouble began. ""I look up and I just see a sea of cars and I go, 'Oh, crap, oh, crap.' And I just go 'We can't stop,' "" Teschke said. ""So we're sliding for about 15 seconds, knowing what's going to happen. Bam, slam into the back of several cars and a semi."" Michigan State Police's Matthew Churchill said it was the worst pile-up he's ever seen. ""Vehicles were actually crashing right in front of us, and there was really nothing we could do except to try to stay out of the way and try to get to the people and keep them in their vehicles where they could be safe,"" Churchill said.

"(CNN) -- The body of a tourist was found off the coast of Thailand Tuesday, but six others remain missing after a ferry sank over the weekend near a popular diving destination, authorities said. Survivors of the ferry sinking disembark the Thai police boat that rescued them. The body is believed to be that of Austrian tourist Gabrielle Jetzinger, the Phuket Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Office told the Thai News Agency. A Thai naval helicopter spotted the body floating face down about 12 nautical miles from Phuket's Promthep cape, and a Thai navy patrol retrieved the floating corpse. The body has been sent to a government hospital for an autopsy, the agency reported. Authorities are still searching for the five tourists and one crew member who remain missing. They are thought to be German, Austrian, Japanese, Swiss and one Thai crew member, the news agency said. The tourist boat, the Choke Somboon 19, was taking passengers from the Similan Islands to Phuket -- an area popular with tourists from around the world. It capsized during a heavy storm Sunday night, said Lt. Sattawat Srirattanapong with the Phuket City police. Survivors included 15 international tourists and eight Thais, who were picked up by a rescue boat Monday morning. Phuket and the Similan Islands are famous for their diving spots, attracting international tourists each year from November to May.","Body thought to be of Austrian tourist found off Thai coast .

"(CNN) -- Todd Rundgren has it backward. Todd Rundgren's new album was inspired by touring and his thoughts on militarism. Not just his songwriting and recording methods, though those, too, are unorthodox. It's the whole music business-pop star arrangement, which is based on musicians determined to hit the Top 40 and then doing it again and again -- with occasional artistic detours -- that he's subverted. He likes it that way. He describes the creation of his music as ""very plastic,"" in the sense of flexible: He creates songs in the studio, piece by piece, and ""it allows me to edit the stuff practically all the way up to the final mix process."" One can easily look at his career the same way, with the detours having been the point of the journey. ""It's unconventional, but if you have those tools available, it becomes the logical way to do things,"" he said of his creative process. Rundgren's new album, ""Arena"" (Hi Fi), sounds like a throwback to his more song-friendly works, which was (mostly) deliberate, he says. The album's 13 power-chord rockers are a tip of the guitar to his recent touring with the New Cars (filling in for Ric Ocasek) and his subject matter, militarism and ""what I saw as a loss of masculine integrity,"" he explained. ""The people who have been running the country are liars and cowards and hypocrites and perverts,"" he said. ""And I wouldn't want all the rest of the men in the world to think that's how you succeed in life. Now that they are out of here, we have to ... reclaim what our traditional ideals were: You protect the weak, you bear up under the horrible burdens, and you seek the truth. ... You sacrifice for others."" Not exactly Top 40 material, but in Rundgren's career, it's the Top 40 hits that have been accidents. He started his solo career in the early '70s with a handful of them -- ""We Gotta Get You a Woman,"" ""Hello, It's Me,"" ""I Saw the Light"" -- but quickly began devoting his time to album-length experiments, with occasional hit-single forays (""Can We Still Be Friends,"" his band Utopia's ""Set Me Free""). Rundgren also became an in-demand producer, with results ranging from No. 1 singles (Grand Funk Railroad's ""We're an American Band"" and ""The Loco-Motion"") to classic albums (XTC's ""Skylarking,"" Meat Loaf's ""Bat Out of Hell""), no two of which sounded exactly alike.  Listen to Rundgren talk about his work with XTC and Grand Funk Railroad » . He says his goal is to bring out the best in whomever he's working with, to make a record that's true to the artist's personality. Ironically, for someone so steeped in technology, he's not a fan of using studio tricks -- AutoTune and the like, which remove all the rough edges from performances -- for the sake of creating something ""perfect."" ""Part of the problem is, there are two ways to make music. One is to be revelatory, and one is to be obfuscating,"" he said. ""You create a different image of yourself for people instead of actually revealing something truly about yourself. And you can say the difference is the difference between Michael Jackson and Tom Waits, or something like that. ... The material Madonna writes is to a persona. The persona is what's being marketed, and the music is just part of the merchandise."" Rundgren himself composes from the inside out, putting technology at his disposal. (He's often been ahead of the tech curve, going back to the late '70s, when he created music videos and software programs and Utopia played on the interactive television service QUBE.) ""I start with a rhythm idea and then add chords,"" he said, creating arrangements as he goes. Lyrics often come last. ""Most people have the song before the arrangement,"" he said. ""I do it the other way around."" On ""Arena,"" the songs -- which all have one-word titles (""I'm close to a haiku,"" Rundgren joked) -- include ""Mad,"" in which Rundgren sings about being ""at the end of my patience""; ""Gun,"" which offers the warning, ""You better run/'Cause I'm young, dumb and I've got a gun""; and ""Today,"" which says, ""Now it's time to break the chain."" The work is timelier than he could have imagined, he says. ""The irony of it is that the album was finished by June 1; then the s*** hit the fan three months later,"" he said, referring to the economic meltdown. ""It's what I've been talking about. We've been indulging ourselves for a long time, and the record is about the kind of militance required to solve problems that tower so high we can't see the top of them."" For someone who writes such audience-friendly hooks, he's skeptical about much of today's pop music -- and its performers. The music may sound technically perfect, but it lacks soul and grit. ""That kind of approach is reinforced all the time by programs like 'American Idol,' where you have to look a certain way and smile a certain way and deliver the song a certain way,"" he said. ""And if you're outside of that, you're going to get bumped. It just makes music all come out kind of the same. ""The thing that makes it different -- the thing that makes it interesting every once in a while -- is when someone comes along and you think that they're not simply using this as a marketing tool for themselves,"" he continued. ""You see them, and obviously music is the thing that redeems them. ... That to me is what makes music exciting, is when suddenly you see someone and you realize they were meant for music."" And Rundgren? He's still meant for music, too. He's preparing to produce a new New York Dolls album, 36 years after he produced the group's debut. There's also talk he'll perform his 1973 album ""A Wizard, A True Star"" live. It's a full schedule doing something he loves, even if there's virtually no chance he'll be topping the charts. ""The record I made now is kind of a result of where I found myself at. I'm only going to be able to do this for a while longer; I'm 60 now. And regardless of how I behave when I'm on stage, I have the same issues that any 60-year-old does,"" he said, admitting to post-concert aches and pains. He laughed. ""I know I can't stop time, but there will be plenty of time to croon for people.""","Todd Rundgren's new album is ""Arena,"" full of power-chord rockers .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Millard Fuller, who founded Habitat for Humanity International along with his wife, has died, officials said Tuesday. He was 74. Millard Fuller appears with President Bush at a Habitat for Humanity event in Tampa, Florida, in 2001. Fuller died early Tuesday ""after a brief illness,"" said a statement on the Web site of the organization he currently headed, Fuller Center for Housing, in Americus, Georgia. ""Family and friends are mourning the tragic loss of a great servant leader and a genuine heart,"" the statement said. Fuller had suffered from chest congestion for three to four weeks, said Holly Chapman, spokeswoman for the Fuller Center. He died about 3 a.m. en route to a hospital, she said. With his wife, Linda, Fuller founded Habitat for Humanity International in 1976. The Alabama native rose ""from humble beginnings"" to become a ""young, self-made millionaire,"" according to his biography on Habitat for Humanity's Web site. He and a college friend began a marketing firm while still in school, ""but as his business prospered, his health, integrity and marriage suffered,"" the biography said. ""These crises prompted Fuller to re-evaluate his values and direction. His soul-searching led to reconciliation with his wife and to a renewal of his Christian commitment,"" it said. The Fullers sold all their possessions, gave money to the poor and began searching for a new direction. They found Koinonia Farm, a Christian community near Americus in rural southwest Georgia, the biography said. Along with Koinonia founder Clarence Jordan and a few others, the couple initiated several enterprises, among them a housing ministry that built modest homes on a no-interest, nonprofit basis and made them affordable to low-income families. Homeowner families were expected to use their own labor to help defray costs on their home as well as homes for other families. Money to build homes was placed into a revolving fund, enabling more to be built, according to the biography. In 1973, the Fullers moved to Africa to test their housing model, the biography said. Their project was launched in Zaire -- now the Democratic Republic of the Congo -- and was a success. ""Fuller became convinced that this model could be expanded and applied all over the world,"" the biography said. When Fuller returned to the United States three years later, he met with a group of associates to create Habitat for Humanity International. According to its Web site, Habitat has provided shelter for more than 1.5 million people in more than 3,000 communities. ""I see life as both a gift and a responsibility. My responsibility is to use what God has given me to help his people in need,"" Fuller once said, according to Habitat's Web site. Former President Carter, a key Habitat supporter, fellow Georgian and a close friend, issued a statement Tuesday saying Fuller ""was one of the most extraordinary people I have ever known."" ""He used his remarkable gifts as an entrepreneur for the benefit of millions of needy people around the world by providing them with decent housing,"" Carter said. ""As the founder of Habitat for Humanity and later the Fuller Center, he was an inspiration to me, other members of our family and an untold number of volunteers who worked side-by-side under his leadership.""  See celebrities working on Habitat projects » . In 1996, President Clinton awarded Fuller the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, calling Habitat ""the most successful continuous community service project in the history of the United States."" Fuller left Habitat for Humanity in 2005 amid a dispute with the organization's board. Habitat said in a statement at the time his termination culminated ""several months of differences between the Fullers and the board over allegations of inappropriate personal behavior of Millard Fuller toward a now-former female employee,"" according to an article in the February 2005 edition of Christianity Today magazine. The organization noted there was insufficient evidence to corroborate the complaint, according to Christianity Today, but said Fuller engaged in ""a pattern of ongoing public comments and communications ... that have been divisive and disruptive to the organization's work."" For his part, Fuller told the magazine he feared the board used the controversy to push him out to find a ""high-paid bean counter"" instead of someone with ""strong Christian commitment."" ""We've overloaded the board with 'money' people, all of whom are nominal Christians, but many of whom are not spiritually grounded,"" he told the magazine. ""Some seem put off by my overt declaration of Jesus."" After his departure, Fuller founded the Fuller Center for Housing, which its Web site describes as ""a nonprofit, ecumenical Christian housing ministry dedicated to eliminating poverty housing worldwide."" The center was founded after Fuller ""set out to expand his missionary vision"" by returning to his roots at Koinonia Farm, a cooperative community dedicated to peace and service. A new mission statement was issued at Koinonia dedicating the Fuller Center as ""a Christ-centered, faith-driven organization witnessing the love of God by providing opportunities for families to have a simple, decent place to live,"" according to the site. Funeral services are scheduled for Wednesday, said Chapman, the Fuller Center spokeswoman. Fuller will be buried at Koinonia Farm, according to the center's Web site.

"(CNN)  -- Back in my day (a day not long ago, as it turns out), you could go down to the local record shop and plunk down your paper-route money for little disks of plastic that were embedded with the latest sounds of your favorite musical performers. A self-admitted tech geek, Chris Pirillo is president of Lockergnome.com, a blogging network. Whether your tastes ran from Al Jarreau to ""Weird Al"" Yankovic, you could be assured that those purchased disks were yours -- for keeps. You could play 'em over and over until they were scratched beyond repair, you could lend 'em to friends, you could amplify 'em at illicit Charleston dancing parties, you could sell 'em to used record stores or you could store 'em away in a safe deposit box in hopes they'd gain value as collector's items. You could even make precious mix tapes for your soda-sharing sweetheart with songs copied from 'em, though this made recording industry executives more than a little nervous. And it wasn't long before their weaselly whimpers of protest began. As the digital age arrived to usher in more perfect ways to copy and distribute (aka ""pirate"") what these executives saw as their property, those whimpers turned to howls. They've only grown louder since. So the recording industry has had a good gig going. It's easy to see why its upper crust is miffed at lowly hoi polloi tampering with its bread and butter (or pizza. Or pie. Whatever crust suits your fancy). One can imagine some mad scientist under the employ of said recording industry locked away in an underground bunker somewhere cooking up a scheme so dark, so evil, that its repercussions would completely remap the way media would be controlled -- with consumers being suckered into paying much, much more for much, much less. This scheme would come to be known as DRM. Digital rights management or devious rental misappropriation? That's right. Rental. You see, you don't really buy music for keeps anymore. I mean, how can you when this is the sort of thing that can happen? It's a bit like buying your dream car, driving it around for a while, then being told it's got to be given back to the factory because the dealership where it was purchased no longer has a legal association with the factory. Sorry if you thought you could drive it around until it was worn out beyond repair, if you thought you could lend it to your friends, if you thought you could drive it to the illicit Charleston dancing party, if you thought you could sell it to a used car dealer or if you thought you could store it under a tarp in your garage for the next couple of decades in hopes it would gain value as a collector's item. Being used to the old, tangible business model, you were under the impression that you'd actually bought something. No one told you that you were merely borrowing someone else's property for a while (and paying for the privilege to do so). Like a sharecropper. Like a serf. Like a sucker. And most people do feel like suckers when DRM locks them out of something that they feel they have every right to use, often to the point of attempting to circumnavigate this crappy, unfair system by means that might lead to trouble. I can only conclude that, like bootleggers at the repealing of Prohibition, viruses and spyware acquired in pursuit of overcoming content restrictions wouldn't prosper in a DRM-free world. Really, it's hard to take alarm from DRM-happy organizations such as the MPAA as anything but a double dose of dookie when you find out that 2007 was a record box office year in spite of all the pirates and ne'er-do-wells and whatnot! Who, exactly, is getting plundered? It's no wonder blogger Cory Doctorow finds DRM to be one of the most offensive digital constructs on the planet. It's inevitable. It'll go away or change dramatically. Let's hope sooner rather than later. (This column was written before Apple announced that iTunes would be, at some point in the future, capable of providing DRM-free music throughout its entire library. This was pretty big news, considering how many people use iTunes to manage their music library. This isn't to say that the DRM-free tracks available at Amazon or eMusic are any less valid, but let's face it: just about everybody who carries an iPod or iPhone also uses iTunes as the gateway for purchasing music.) I subscribe to Rhapsody, so I can listen to just about anything from my desktop, and subscriptions are my preferred method of content consumption. I have an XM satellite radio subscription, I pay for just about every channel on digital cable and I have been known to purchase hard copies of content in the past (DVDs, CDs, 8-track tapes, etc.) But DRM? It's no good. It's downright evil. I find it very difficult to purchase something outright when I'm told that I can only play it X times, only on X devices or for X long. That's counter-intuitive and consumer unfriendly. There are certainly exceptions to the rule, but not when the content is a commodity. I once found four different versions of the same song on my wife's system. One had been purchased on Rhapsody, another on iTunes, another on Napster and the fourth was an MP3! Quadruple madness! I don't care how good a song is, she doesn't need to have four copies of it (three of which are completely useless without the proper systems in place). The MP3? It's as perfect as it needs to be, playable on just about anything these days. That's consumer friendly.","Services that limit when and how you play digital music are ripping off consumers .

"(CNN) -- The suspect accused of killing a minister at an Illinois church had marked the day of the attack as a ""day of death"" or ""death day"" in a planning book, a prosecutor said Tuesday. Terry J. Sedlacek, shown in a family photo, has been charged with first-degree murder. There were ""words to those effect,"" written in a day planner belonging to Terry J. Sedlacek, the man accused in Sunday's attack at the First Baptist Church in Maryville, Illinois, said William Mudge, the Madison County state's attorney. Mudge said he hadn't seen the planner and could not recall the exact wording that police described to him. He said police found the book in Sedlacek's home. Lt. Scott Compton of the Illinois State Police said he hadn't seen the planner and could not confirm Mudge's account. Authorities have charged Sedlacek, 27, with first-degree murder in the killing of the Rev. Fred Winters. He also was charged with two counts of aggravated battery related to the stabbing of church members Terry Bullard and Keith Melton. Sedlacek was seriously wounded in the melee, authorities said. Melton, one of the two church members stabbed in the attack, described the scene that erupted during Sunday service. Winters had been preaching for a while when the gunman approached him, Melton told CNN. ""It just seemed a lot out of place for someone to be walking to the front to take a seat at that point in the service,"" Melton said.  Watch Melton say they're ""still very stunned"" » . Winters stopped his sermon and asked the man what he could do for him, Melton said. The assailant fired a weapon and hit the pastor's Bible, causing ""confetti"" to fly into the air, Melton recalled. ""It was a bit confusing just at first,"" Melton said, adding that he could see from the pastor's reaction that what happened was not part of the service.  Watch the aftermath of the church shooting » . Melton was one of two men who first jumped the assailant, he said. ""By the time the second shot rang out, there were a number of us who sprang into action,"" Melton said. Winters jumped off the stage, Melton said, and was met by the gunman. The two wrestled and more shots rang out. The attacker's .45-caliber weapon jammed at that point, authorities said. The assailant tried to get away but was subdued by church members, some of whom blocked the entrances while others grappled with the gunman. ""There were men everywhere,"" Melton said. It was minutes before Melton realized he had been stabbed, he said, attributing the delay to adrenaline. He was treated and released from a local hospital. Bullard, another church member, also was stabbed in the attempt to subdue the gunman. Sedlacek is being treated at a hospital after suffering serious knife wounds. ""When he was tackled by two of the members, we don't know whether he fell on the knife, injuring himself at the time, or whether [his injury] was self-inflicted during the struggle,"" said Illinois State Police Director Larry Trent.  Watch police describe the church members' ""heroic action"" » . Trent said police are trying to determine a motive, noting that church members did not recognize the gunman. In August, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch profiled Sedlacek in an article on Lyme disease, and quoted his mother, Ruth Abernathy, as saying he began acting strangely during his junior year in high school. He seemed confused and stopped participating in activities that had interested him, she told the newspaper. She said a doctor had diagnosed Sedlacek as mentally ill before a battery of tests revealed that he had Lyme disease, according to the paper. The newspaper reported that even years later, Sedlacek, then 26, had lesions on his brain and was taking several medications, including an anti-seizure drug. The Post-Dispatch identified him as a resident of Troy, Illinois, in suburban St. Louis. A spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday that mental illness associated with Lyme disease is highly unusual, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America said Lyme disease ""is not known to cause violent behavior."" But a study published in 2002 in the American Journal of Psychiatry and carried out in the Czech Republic found that 36 percent of 900 psychiatric subjects had antibodies to the bacterium linked to Lyme disease, versus 18 percent of 900 healthy control subjects. The Illinois shooting is believed to be the nation's first in a church since July, when a 58-year-old man opened fire in a Knoxville, Tennessee, church during a children's play. Two people were killed and six wounded in the shooting at Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church.  See a U.S. map of other recent church shootings » .

"(CNN) -- More than 1,300 Palestinians died and about 5,400 others were wounded during Israel's three-week offensive in Gaza, the Web site of the Palestinian Authority's Central Bureau of Statistics said Monday. A Palestinian man Monday prays in the rubble of his home,  destroyed during Israel's offensive in Gaza. Louay Shabana, head of the agency, said more than 22,000 buildings were damaged or destroyed. Shabana put the economic destruction at more than $1.9 billion. The fighting largely stopped Sunday with a cease-fire. Israel has said 13 of its citizens -- including 10 soldiers -- were killed during the offensive, which started December 27. Israel said its offensive was aimed at stopping Hamas militants from firing rockets into southern Israel. Gaza is in need of humanitarian, economic, sanitary and social help as a result of the Israeli attacks, Shabana said. The attacks destroyed public sector and private buildings in Gaza, affecting even the United Nations Relief and Works Agency's facilities and halting economic and social services, the statistics agency said.  Watch Palestinians recover bodies from rubble » . Gaza's gross domestic product was slashed by 85 percent during the 22 days of war, and it could take a year for the economy to recover, the agency said in a preliminary report. About 80 percent of crops in Gaza were destroyed, according to the agency. ""The pervasive sense here among the population is one of overwhelming grief, so many families have been destroyed in so many ways,"" said John Ging, the top United Nations official in Gaza. Ging, UNRWA's Gaza director of operations, said the bill could reach ""billions of dollars."" Among the dead were 159 children, two of whom died in an UNRWA school that was shelled Saturday, Ging said. Gaza's main border crossings, which Israel often closed in response to Hamas rocket attacks, were open Monday. Infrastructure repairs were being made, but 400,000 people still had no water, according to Ging. Streets in some northern Gaza towns were flooded with sewage, and about 50 U.N. facilities were damaged, he said. More than 170 supply trucks crossed into Gaza on Monday, less than a third of the daily number that crossed in 2005, said John Holmes, U.N. under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator. Israel tried to avoid civilian casualties in Gaza, a senior Israel Defense Forces officer said in a posting Monday on the IDF Web site. ""This was not a war against the Palestinians,"" he said. ""It was an operation of self-defense against Hamas and related terror organizations. Unfortunately, this task was made extremely difficult by Hamas, as they made the choice to use civilians as human shields."" Israel began the offensive in response to rocket fire by Hamas militants after showing eight years of restraint, the officer said. The operation's goal, he said, ""was to improve the security situation in southern Israel, and to facilitate peaceful living for the Israeli civilians living there."" ""We asked ourselves how to accomplish this, and the answer was to hit Hamas hard -- to strike the tunnels, the terrorists themselves, and all of their assets -- in order to prevent them from committing war crimes by firing rockets that target our civilian population,"" the officer said. He said seven rockets have been fired from Gaza into Israel since Sunday's cease-fire declaration. ""We want to give this cease-fire a chance, but if Hamas chooses not to, we will utilize all of our means,"" he said.","Israeli offensive caused $1.9 billion in economic destruction in Gaza, official says .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraqi leaders are applauding President Obama's plan to withdraw most U.S. troops from the country by August 2010. U.S. troops will cede security measures to Iraqi security forces including the police, shown here, and the army.

"(CNN) -- At 44-years-old Abhisit Vejjajiva is Thailand's youngest prime minister in more than 60 years. But perhaps more immediately significantly, he is the country's third prime minister in four months after a period of immense upheaval in Thailand. After just two days of taking office, Thai PM Abhisit Vejjajiva talked to CNN's Dan Rivers for Talk Asia. Thailand's recent political turmoil, which included national demonstrations and the forced closures of international airports, dates back to the 2006 coup that overthrew former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the former People's Power Party leader. In September, the Constitutional Court forced out his replacement Samak Sundaravej, finding that he had violated the constitution by appearing as a paid guest on a television cooking show. In turn he was replaced by Thaksin's brother-in-law, Somchai Wongsawat, who immediately found himself beset by opposition demonstrations that accused him of leading a proxy government for Thaksin. He too was thrown out by a Constitutional Court ruling. Abhisit was named as the new Prime Minister on December 15, and his biggest challenge will be to steady a country that until recently was known as one of the most region's most stable. A career politician, Abhisit was born in Newcastle in the north east of England to wealthy Thai-Chinese parents and attended Eton, one of the UK's top private schools before studying politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford University. While highly critical of the corruption and cronyism in Thai politics, Abhisit's own route to power has not been as he may have wanted it. As leader of the Democrat Party since 2005, he failed to win either of the elections he contended. He was chosen by the Thai parliament to be Prime Minister during a special session. His selection was contingent on support of factions from the now banned PPP who changed allegiance, many of whom he had previously criticized. Abhisit now leads a coalition government with a small majority consisting of a number of parties and interests, leading political commentators to speculate about the length of his tenure in office, many suggesting more than a year in power would be a success. Countering accusations of inexperience, Abhisit can still boast 17 years of political practice, having become a parliamentarian at the age of 27. As well as being young and cosmopolitan, he has gained a reputation as being above the sleaze and corruption that has dogged many other Thai politicians, while he publicly opposed the bloodless military coup that removed Thaksin from office 2006.

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani troops have been moved to the Indian border amid fears of an Indian ground incursion, two Pakistani military officials told CNN on Friday. File image of a Pakistani soldier . The troops were deployed from Pakistan's western border with Afghanistan, where forces have been battling Taliban and al Qaeda militants in North West Frontier Province and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. Pakistan's armed forces have been on high alert in anticipation of a possible conflict with India following last month's terrorist attacks in Mumbai, which killed 160 people. India believes the 10 men who carried out the attacks were trained at a terrorist camp in the Pakistani-controlled part of Kashmir. A senior official said the troops had been moved from areas where there are no active military operations, and emphasized that troop levels have not been depleted in areas where soldiers are battling militants, such as the Swat Valley and near Peshawar, capital of the North West region. In addition to the move, leave for all military personnel has been restricted and all troops were called back to active duty, the senior official said. Asked for a reaction to the development, Husain Haqqani, Pakistani ambassador to the United States, said, ""Pakistan does not seek war, but we need to be vigilant against threats of war emanating from the other side of our eastern border."" He said Pakistan's conduct since the Mumbai attack ""has been consistent with international expectations. There is no justification for threats against Pakistan."" ""Pakistan is also a victim of terrorism and will continue to act against terrorists,"" he added. ""We are a country of rule of law and need evidence to prosecute anyone for the crime of terrorism."" U.S. National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said the United States has been ""in close contact"" with India and Pakistan in probing the Mumbai attack and fighting terror. He is hoping that ""both sides will avoid taking steps that will unnecessarily raise tensions during these already tense times."" In London, England, Pakistani envoy to Britain Wajid Shamsul Hasan countered the report, noting that winter redeployments are normal and that only police and not the army had their vacation canceled. While he criticized India's ""coercive diplomacy"" and regretted India's ""war hysteria,"" he underscored the fact that the two countries don't want to go to war. Tensions increased between nuclear rivals India and Pakistan following the November 26 attacks in Mumbai, where militants launched a coordinated strike against luxury hotels, a Jewish center and other targets. India has criticized Islamabad for not doing enough to counter terrorism, and it has accused elements within the Pakistan government and military of complicity in fueling terrorism in the region. On Thursday, Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi warned India to refrain from launching any strikes against Pakistan, according to a report in The Nation newspaper. Another unnamed Pakistani military official told CNN that the Pakistani military has been taking precautionary measures to safeguard borders in the face of mounting military threats from India over the Mumbai attacks. ""Naturally, you have to take certain steps to stem that expected tide of Indian operations,"" he said, ""You can't fight on both fronts so we have redeployed certain military elements from the western border to the northern border to meet Indian operations."" The official said that while Pakistan has tolerated U.S. missile strikes from Afghanistan into Pakistan, he believes the government and public would not stand for an Indian incursion. In the Indian capital of New Delhi on Friday, three military chiefs briefed Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the security situation. An Indian officer said Indian soldiers have spotted Pakistani troop movements along the Line of Control in Kashmir. The Line of Control divides the disputed region between the area controlled by India and the area administered by Pakistan. Indian defense spokesman Sitanshu Kar said India isn't carrying out a troop buildup along its western borders but ""is monitoring the situation closely."" He also said he is ""not aware"" of military reports about Pakistani troop mobilization along the Indian border. ""But we are keeping a vigil,"" Kar said. Since the division of the subcontinent in 1947, India and Pakistan have fought three wars, including two over the disputed territory of Kashmir -- now wracked by an 18-year, bloody separatist campaign that authorities say has left at least 43,000 dead. There also was a limited border conflict in 1999 between the countries in Kashmir.

"(CNN)  -- Los Alamos National Laboratory announced Wednesday it is notifying nearly 2,000 current and former employees and visitors that they may have been exposed to beryllium in the lab and may be at risk of disease. Officials are trying to determine the source of beryllium found at Los Alamos National Laboratory. ""Letters went out to all of them today,"" said Kevin Roark, a spokesman for the New Mexico laboratory. Concern over possible exposure to the hard, gray metal, which is purified for use in nuclear weapons and reactors and also used in bicycle frames and golf clubs,  was first raised last November, when a box containing beryllium was received at the laboratory's short-term storage facility, he said. ""The package appeared to have damage or degradation of the packing materials, which prompted us to test the area for additional contamination,"" he said. Surface contamination was found, but it turned out that the box was not the source, Roark said, adding that the source has not been determined. Since the contaminated area had not been tested for the presence of beryllium since 2001, everyone who has entered the restricted-access area since then is being alerted, he said. ""It's just one building at one technical area,"" Roark said, noting that the laboratory covers 36 square miles and has nearly 10,000 employees. Beryllium is hazardous only when its fine, particulate form is inhaled, he said. It was found on surfaces, not in the air, he said.  Find out more about beryllium » . Roark said the alert was sent because ""we think it's the responsible, prudent thing to do to let people know we discovered this contamination and to answer their questions if they have any concern about potential for exposure."" There are no reports of sickness and ""we don't expect anyone to be ill,"" he said. The laboratory said about 240 employees and 1,650 visitors were potentially at risk because they visited the contaminated areas. About 2 percent of the exposed employees could become sensitized, a smaller percentage of whom could develop chronic beryllium disease, Roark said. Inhalation of powdered beryllium can result in chronic beryllium disease, which can impair lung function in people who are susceptible. The risk to the visitors would be ""extremely low"" because of the activities they performed and their short exposure time, Roark said. An operator will be available at the laboratory at 505-665-7233 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Mountain Time, Monday through Friday.","Los Alamos lab visitors, employees may have been exposure to beryllium .

"(CNN) -- California's Supreme Court said Wednesday that it will hear the appeal of a challenge to Proposition 8, a voter-approved measure outlawing same-sex marriage. California's voter-approved measure banning same-sex marriage has sparked protests throughout the state. In a written statement, the court said it will not block the implementation or enforcement of the law in the meantime. Proposition 8 passed with about 52.5 percent of the vote, making California one of several states to ban same-sex marriage in the November 4 elections. But unlike the other states, California had already been issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples since May, after a state Supreme Court ruling legalized the unions. The American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and the National Center for Lesbian Rights filed legal challenges to the vote, asking the high court to rule the ballot-initiative process was ""improperly used"" to strip away a right protected by the state constitution. iReport.com: Share your view on same-sex marriage . The court said arguments in the case could be heard as early as March. In its May 15 ruling legalizing same-sex marriage in California, the justices seemed to signal that a ballot initiative like Proposition 8 might not be enough to change the underlying constitutional issues of the case in the court's eyes. The ruling said the right to marry is among a set of basic human rights ""so integral to an individual's liberty and personal autonomy that they may not be eliminated or abrogated by the legislature or by the electorate through the statutory initiative process."" In the hours after the proposition's apparent passage, thousands of protesters took to the streets of Los Angeles and other cities across California in protest.

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- At least 43 civilians were killed Sunday when they were caught in the crossfire between Pakistani forces and Taliban militants, a Pakistani military official said. The official, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said the incident happened in Charbagh, a district of Swat Valley in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province. The mountainous Swat Valley region used to be a popular destination for tourists and skiers, but today it is a Taliban stronghold. The Pakistani government and the army have come under criticism in recent weeks for allowing the security situation in Swat to deteriorate in the past few months. Islamabad has said there are plans for a new strategy to fight the Taliban, but they have yet to offer details. The Taliban are imposing their strict brand of Islamic law in the region -- banning music, forbidding men from shaving, and not allowing teenage girls to attend school.  Watch a report on civilians killed in crossfire » . Government officials say the Taliban have torched and destroyed more than 180 schools in the Swat region. Many families have fled the area, and have been followed by many Pakistani police officers who are too scared to take on Taliban forces, a Pakistani army spokesman told CNN last week. The Taliban seized control of Afghanistan in 1996 -- harboring al Qaeda leaders, including Osama bin Laden -- and ruled it until they were ousted from power in 2001 after the September 11 attacks on the United States. Since then, the Taliban have regrouped and are currently battling U.S. and NATO-led forces. U.S. President Barack Obama has called Afghanistan the ""central front"" in the war on terror and has promised to make fighting extremism there, and in neighboring Pakistan, a foreign policy priority. He is expected to send as many as 30,000 additional U.S. troops to battle Taliban forces. Richard Holbrooke, the administration's new envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, is scheduled to make his first trip to the region this week.","Swat Valley region used to be a popular destination for tourists and skiers .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Hillary Clinton was sworn in as the 67th U.S. secretary of state Wednesday afternoon after the Senate approved her nomination by a vote of 94-2. Hillary Clinton gets sworn in Wednesday in her Senate office by Judge Kathryn Oberly. Former President Clinton and her Senate staff looked on as Clinton's childhood friend and D.C. Court of Appeals Associate Judge Kathryn Oberly swore her in on a Bible belonging to the former first lady's late father in a ceremony in her Senate office. The senators who opposed Clinton's confirmation were Jim DeMint, R-South Carolina, and David Vitter, R-Louisiana. Keeping with tradition, America's new chief diplomat will be treated to a welcoming ceremony with employees Thursday morning in the State Department, agency officials said. Immediately after the ceremony, Clinton submitted her resignation from the Senate with identical one-sentence letters to Vice President Joe Biden, who serves as president of the Senate, Secretary of the Senate Nancy Erickson and New York Gov. David Paterson. Paterson must appoint a replacement in the Senate. The governor, who had said he would not name his choice until after Clinton's confirmation, told CNN's ""American Morning"" on Monday that he had not made a decision. ""I'm actually, I think, narrowing the field to about half of the people who are involved, and then I would hope, in the next few days, to get down to one,"" he told CNN's John Roberts. Some of the better-known candidates, including Nassau County Executive Tom Suozzi and U.S. Reps. Carolyn Maloney and Steve Israel, have pledged not to wage a primary fight against Paterson's pick in the 2010 special election to finish the final two years of Clinton's term. Clinton's confirmation was held up Tuesday when Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn objected to a voice vote, demanding a roll-call vote instead. Cornyn said he knew that Clinton would be confirmed but said he delayed the vote because he wanted more time to talk about the foundation run by her husband. The former president signed an agreement with the Obama transition team pledging to limit foreign donations and to release annual disclosures of new donations to his foundation. ""My concern is not whether our colleague Sen. Clinton is qualified to be secretary of state or not. She is,"" Cornyn said. ""But we should not let our respect for Sen. Clinton or our admiration for the many good works of the Clinton Foundation blind us to the danger of perceived conflicts of interest caused by the [foundation's] solicitation of hundreds of millions of dollars from foreign and some domestic sources,"" he said. ""The perception and reality must be that the office of secretary of state is viewed around the world as beyond reproach."" Clinton was defended by Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, who used his first floor speech since the end of the presidential campaign to urge his colleagues to confirm her quickly as secretary of state. iReport.com: Share your thoughts on Obama's cabinet . ""I think the message that the American people are sending us now is they want us to work together and get to work,"" McCain said. ""I think we ought to let Sen. Clinton, who is obviously qualified and obviously will serve, get to work immediately."" McCain confidantes told CNN that the senator developed a genuinely deep admiration for Clinton during the drawn-out Democratic primary process. Both senators also sit on the Armed Services Committee and had become close on several congressional delegation trips abroad. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 16-1 last week in favor of Clinton's nomination, with Vitter casting the sole dissenting vote.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Adventurer Steve Fossett's ill-fated flight was simply going to be a ""Sunday drive,"" but one camper who thinks he saw the plane said the craft was fighting headwinds. Steve Fossett was the first person to circle the globe solo in a balloon and the first to fly a plane around the world solo without refueling. Details from a National Transportation Safety Board report released Thursday present facts about the accident that occurred September 3, 2007, after Fossett, 63, took off from the airport of the Flying M Ranch outside Minden, Nevada. These fact-finding reports, which are routine, do not give causes for crashes. Officials eventually discovered the wreckage at an altitude of about 10,000 feet in the Sierra Nevadas near Mammoth Lakes, California, after a hiker reported finding Fossett's personal effects, including identification cards, about a half-mile from the wreckage. DNA tests confirmed that skeletal fragments found near Fossett's personal effects were his. In 2002 Fossett became the first person to circle the globe solo in a balloon. Three years later he became the first to fly a plane around the world solo without refueling. Fossett also set world records in round-the-world sailing and cross-country skiing. The NTSB said the single-engine Super Decathlon ""collided with terrain while maneuvering in remote mountainous terrain approximately eight miles west-northwest of Mammoth Lakes, California, destroying the plane and killing the pilot."" The cause of death was ""multiple traumatic injuries"" and ""the airplane was severely fragmented and a severe post crash fire burned most of the structure and surrounding vegetation."" The accident site was 65 miles south of the departure point. A camper thinks he saw the plane about 30 miles north of the accident site. ""The airplane was heading into the wind, and it looked like it was standing still due to the wind,"" the NTSB report said. The ranch's chief pilot prepared the plane for flight after Fossett told him at breakfast that he wanted to fly the Super Decathlon. The plane was commonly used for spotting cattle. It had hit a barbed wire fence several months earlier during a landing roll, and a new speed propeller was put on the plane. It was returned to service a month later and was flown 10 to 12 hours. The report noted that the pilot's wife said the ""purpose of the flight was pleasure"" and that she ""characterized it as 'a Sunday drive.' "" ""The pilot gave no indication that he planned to perform aerobatic maneuvers, and he was not wearing a parachute, which is required for aerobatics. He was seated in the front seat of the tandem two place airplane,"" the report said. It had been previously reported that Fossett was scouting locations for an attempt to break the land speed record in a rocket-propelled car. Fossett arrived at the airport about 8:15 a.m. and conducted a preflight of the airplane in the presence of the chief pilot. A ranch employee saw the plane around 8:25 or 8:35 a.m. nine miles south of the departure strip and flying south about 150 to 200 feet about the ground. The airplane, which flew during downdrafts, was expected to return by 10:30 or 11 a.m. When the plane didn't return, a search began. Pilots in the region were interviewed in the aftermath of the crash. One pilot said there was no ""big turbulence"" and he did not have to slow up because of ""rough air."" Another pilot reported blue skies but remembers ""random clear turbulence"" in a descent into Reno, Nevada. He remembers a ""random rough chop"" interrupting a smooth ride, calling it a ""weird day."" A third pilot reported windiness during takeoff but said there was smooth air and dropped-off winds when he got above 10,000 feet. The accident area was ""about 300 feet below the crest of a ridge"" and ""the steep terrain was sparsely forested with Ponderosa pines averaging 40 to 60 feet tall. Numerous boulders and rock outcrops surrounded by grassy areas covered the ground.""","NTSB releases facts about the September 3, 2007, accident that killed adventurer .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- All 18 people aboard a helicopter that crashed off the coast of Scotland have been recovered alive, a Royal Air Force officer told CNN. A Super Puma helicopter, similar to the one in this file photo, went down about 120 miles east of Aberdeen. The Super Puma ditched about 120 miles east of Aberdeen while approaching an offshore platform. ""Everyone has been recovered from the water,"" said James Lyon, assistant controller of the RAF's aeronautical rescue coordination center at RAF Kinloss, Scotland. ""We don't know their condition, but we believe there are no major injuries."" Five helicopters were scrambled when the Super Puma helicopter ditched. ""Some were recovered by helicopter and some by boat from the platform,"" Lyon told CNN. The RAF was providing helicopter assistance to the Aberdeen Coast Guard in the rescue. Lyon said earlier that rescuers had been picking up emergency signal beacons  from the lifejackets of the 18 people. He did not know if the pilot transmitted a mayday before the aircraft ditched.  View a map of the crash site » . ""We believe it was quite close to the platform it was supposed to be landing on,"" he added. The area is home to a number of offshore oil rigs. Lyon said he did not know which one the helicopter was heading to or where it was coming from. The RAF received its first report of the crash at 6:43 p.m. (1:43 p.m. Eastern time). Lyon said the Super Puma is regularly used to transport people to and from oil platforms in the North Sea and as far as he was aware it has a good safety record. Weather at the crash site is relatively good, though slight fog is hampering visibility, he said. A spokesman for BP told the UK's Press Association: ""The 16 passengers and two crew who were on board have been accounted for and have been rescued.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It's time this debate was settled once and for all. Football or soccer? What do you think the round-ball game should be called? While it may be a basic discussion; arguing whether the beautiful game should be called ""football"" or ""soccer"" is one of the most fundamental debates of the code. On the face it, the answer should be simple. The world body -- FIFA -- has the word ""football"" in its title. End of story? Not quite. The term soccer was coined as slang for ""association,"" in England in the 1880s. The Oxford University Association Football Club's Web site explains that former England captain Charles Wreford-Brown is commonly credited with its origin. Soccer would have been used to differentiate between University sports rugby football (""rugger"") and ""association"" football. Therefore, contrary to popular belief, the word soccer is a British term, not an American one. Soccer is more commonly used in countries that play other forms of football, i.e. Americans also play gridiron football and Australians who play ""Aussie Rules"" football -- a completely different sport entirely. Soccer was initially referred to as football in the United States. In 1913 the United States of America Football Association was formed. In later years, it became the United States Soccer Football Association and today is known as the United States Soccer Federation. Meanwhile they now have the Football Federation of Australia, it's hard to imagine a change to the national side's ""Socceroos"" nickname anytime soon. The ""Footyroos"" doesn't quite have the same sound to it. Now, you may be sitting back in Britain reading this and wondering why there should be any debate at all about the name of football? If you are thinking that, just remember one of the most popular shows in Britain is called ""Soccer Saturday"", so it's not as clear cut as you may think! Even the sport's governing body seems to be open to both options. At next year's FIFA World Cup in South Africa, the area where fans will gather during the tournament is to be called ""Soccer City"". Maybe the word ""football"" just doesn't work? We'd like you to tell us whether the game should be called football or soccer and why. Let us know in the SoundOff box below.

"(CNN) -- Pakistan's former president said his country is being treated ""unequally"" to other countries, despite being a staunch ally of the United States in its war on terror. Former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf says anti-American sentiment in Pakistan is high. ""Pakistan is being treated so unequally while we are the ones who are in the lead role fighting the global war on terror,"" said Pervez Musharraf, interviewed by CNN's Wolf Blitzer for ""The Situation Room."" ""This is what hurts Pakistan. It hurts the leadership. Indeed, it hurts the government. It hurts the people of Pakistan,"" said Musharraf, speaking from Dallas, Texas, during a book tour in the United States. The interview took place amid reports Friday of U.S. drones striking militant targets in Pakistan just days after the start of the Obama administration -- which has made combating al Qaeda and Taliban militants in the Pakistan tribal region near Afghanistan its most immediate national security priority. Musharraf was asked whether he is comfortable with the continuation of the attacks, even with a new U.S. president in place. ""Nobody in Pakistan is comfortable with the strikes across the border. There is no doubt in that. Public opinion is very much against it,"" he said. ""But as far as this issue of the new president -- President Obama having taken over and this continuing -- but I have always been saying that policies don't change with personalities; policies have national interest, and policies depend on an environment. ""So the environment and national interest of the United States being the same, I thought policies will remain constant,"" he said.  Watch Musharraf address the reported U.S. air strike » . Musharraf also addressed a statement he made about the $10 billion in assistance from the United States that Pakistan has received, calling it a ""pittance for a country which is in the lead role to fight terrorism."" He emphasized his gratitude to the United States for the funding, but said the amount is low compared to billions spent in Afghanistan and ""maybe over a trillion dollars"" in Iraq. ""Please don't think that this $10 billion was such a great amount that we ought to be eternally grateful while we know that we deserve much more and we should have got much more and we must get much more if we are to fight the global war on terror,"" he said. Musharraf stressed that Pakistan was ""in the lead role fighting a war for you for 10 years, between '79 and '89,"" a reference to Pakistan's alliance with the United States and the Afghan mujahedeen rebels during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Musharraf emphasized that for 42 years, up until 1989, Pakistan had been a ""strategic partner"" of the United States. But many Pakistanis felt abandoned by the United States after the Russians pulled out of Afghanistan. Musharraf said the 1989 ""peace dividend"" went to Europe -- East Europe. Pakistan was ""left alone"" from 1989 to 2001, and during that period, the militant Taliban movement took control of Afghanistan. ""What did Pakistan get out of fighting for 10 years with you? Nothing, sir,"" he said, explaining why public opinion in Pakistan has been ""so much against the United States."" Musharraf said public opinion in his country is strongly against strikes by U.S. drones against militants in the Pakistani tribal region. While al Qaeda and the Taliban must be confronted, he said, ""public opinion is certainly against the methodology being adopted.""  Watch Musharraf says Pakistan is not sponsoring terrorism » . Musharraf, once Pakistan's army chief, resigned under intense political pressure in August as the ruling coalition began taking steps to impeach him. He swept to power in 1999 in a bloodless coup. Asked why al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, who is thought to be somewhere in the border region, hasn't been found, he replied: . ""I would like to ask the United States why he hasn't been found. They have their intelligence. There are -- you have more intelligence capability. I would like to ask the United States, why Mullah Omar has not been found, who is the leader of all of the Taliban in Afghanistan?""","""We are ... in the lead role fighting the global war on terror,"" Musharraf says .

"(CNN) -- You're in a room with 10 other people who seem to agree on something, but you hold the opposite view. Do you say something? Or do you just go along with the others? Imaging techniques help scientists look at the basis for principles of social psychology in the brain. Decades of research show people tend to go along with the majority view, even if that view is objectively incorrect. Now, scientists are supporting those theories with brain images. A new study in the journal Neuron shows when people hold an opinion differing from others in a group, their brains produce an error signal. A zone of the brain popularly called the ""oops area"" becomes extra active, while the ""reward area"" slows down, making us think we are too different. ""We show that a deviation from the group opinion is regarded by the brain as a punishment,"" said Vasily Klucharev, postdoctoral fellow at the F.C. Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging at Radboud University Nijmegen in the Netherlands and lead author of the study.  Watch to learn more about the study » . Participants, all female, had to rate 222 faces based on physical beauty on a scale from 1 to 8. Afterwards, researchers told each participant either that the average score was higher or that it was lower than her rating. Some participants were told the average rating was equal to her rating. The researchers then chatted with the participant before suddenly asking the participant to do the rating again. Most subjects changed their opinion toward the average. The two leading theories of conformity are that people look to the group because they're unsure of what to do, and that people go along with the norm because they are afraid of being different, said Dr. Gregory Berns, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia. Berns' research, which he describes in the book ""Iconoclast: A Neuroscientist Reveals How to Think Differently,"" found that brain mechanisms associated with fear and anxiety do play a part in situations where a person feels his or her opinion goes against the grain. Participants looked at projections of three-dimensional objects, and had to identify which shapes were similar. As with the new study in Neuron, participants tended to shift their opinion to the majority view, although in this case the problems had objectively correct answers. The effect was also more potent in this experiment because actors were in the room to simulate a group with a shared opinion, he said. But brain images revealed participants were not lying just to fit in. Changes in the activation of the visual part of the brain suggest the group opinion actually changed participants' perceptions of what they saw. One reason behind conformity is that, in terms of human evolution, going against the group is not beneficial to survival, Berns said. There is a tremendous survival advantage to being in a community, he said. ""Our brains are exquisitely tuned to what other people think about us, aligning our judgments to fit in with the group,"" Berns said. The most famous experiments in the field were conducted by Solomon Asch in the 1950s. He found that many people gave incorrect answers about matching  lines printed on cards, echoing the incorrect answers of the actors in the room. But unlike Berns' finding that fear and anxiety relate to this effect, Asch saw conformity studies reflections of people's reliance on one another for knowledge of the world, experts say. The darker side of conformity relates to Stanley Milgram's experiments of the 1960s and 1970s, in which most people obeyed orders to deliver electric shocks to an innocent person in the next room. As in these studies, subjects caved into social pressure, presumably going against their own previous moral convictions. Read more about the Milgram study . The research calls into question decision-making bodies that operate by consensus, Berns said. For example, in the U.S. legal system, many cases are decided by the unanimous judgment of the members of a jury. ""You can't separate those judgments from the fact that you have 12 people who have to come to a unanimous decision, and have to conform their opinion to each other, so of course it will distort how they view evidence,"" he said. ""Any type of group decision-making process that does not require unanimous decisions is likely to make a better one,"" Berns said. ""That applies to committees in particular."" What does it take to break the conformity effect? Asch talked about the power of the ""minority of one."" When a unanimous group pressures the individual, that group is weakened as soon as one person breaks off. ""Anyone inclined to draw too pessimistic conclusions from this report would do well to remind himself that the capacities for independence are not to be underestimated,"" Asch wrote in a 1955 ""Scientific American"" article describing his research. ""He may also draw some consolation from a further observation: Those who participated in this challenging experiment agreed nearly without exception that independence was preferable to conformity.""","New study looks at how people change opinions of the beauty of images .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Iran Tuesday successfully launched its first satellite into orbit, a step hailed by Iran's president as a ""source of pride"" for the Islamic republic, according to state-run news outlets. Reported satellite launch took place on the 30th anniversary of the Islamic revolution in Iran. U.S. Department of Defense officials confirmed the launch, and the State Department expressed ""grave concern."" ""Developing a space launch vehicle that could ... put a satellite into orbit could possibly lead to development of a ballistic missile system,"" State Department acting spokesman Robert Wood told reporters. ""So that's of grave concern to us."" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is expected to discuss Iran in meetings Tuesday with British Foreign Secretary David Miliband and German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier. On Wednesday officials from the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China will meet in Germany to discuss next steps on Iran. Wood said that Undersecretary William Burns, who is representing the United States, will seek input and discuss some ideas the Obama administration has about how to move forward.  Watch Iran launch its first satellite » . Two U.S. officials confirmed that Iran had launched a low-earth orbit satellite, CNN Pentagon Correspondent Barbara Starr said. There were no indications of any weapons activity on the two-stage rocket, although the rocket is capable of launching long-range weapons, the officials said. ""I wouldn't think of this in terms of highly advanced technology,"" one U.S. official said. But it does suggest Iran's two-stage rockets are increasingly reliable. The Pentagon said Tuesday the launch is ""clearly a concern of ours."" ""Although this appears to be satellite, there are dual-use capabilities that could be applied to missiles, and that's a concern to us and everybody in region,"" Department of Defense spokesman Geoff Morrell said. The launch of the satellite Omid -- which means ""Hope"" in Farsi -- was timed to coincide with the 30th anniversary celebrations of the Islamic revolution in Iran, according to Iranian media reports. Iran said the satellite had already completed its first mission -- to transmit a message from Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who spoke at the launching ceremony Monday night. In his message, Ahmadinejad congratulated the nation and said the successful launch improves Iran's status in the world, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported. He stressed that both the satellite and the Safir rocket used to launch it were made entirely by Iranian technicians. Iranian Defense Minister Mostafa Mohammad Najjar said that despite the small size of the Omid satellite, it will open the way for an Iranian space program. He said Tehran plans to launch another satellite in the future. In August, Iran performed a test of a rocket capable of launching a satellite into orbit. Iranian officials declared that mission a success, but U.S. officials disputed that. Senior U.S. officials had expressed concerned about the test of the rocket, saying Iran could use the rocket to deliver warheads.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Barack Obama's presidential transition, already disrupted by the sudden withdrawal of New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, may face another challenge in the confirmation hearings of his pick for attorney general. Eric Holder likely will face a grueling round of questions from Republicans during his confirmation hearings. While the Senate is expected to easily confirm the majority of the president-elect's Cabinet appointments, it increasingly appears that attorney general designate Eric Holder could face a grueling round of questions next week from Senate Republicans who are already emboldened by charges of ""pay-to-play"" politics against Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich and a federal investigation into Richardson, who Obama picked as his commerce secretary. ""Republicans are seeing enough different stories in the taints of possible corruption around Democratic politicians lately,"" said Alexander Keyssar, a professor of history and social policy at the Harvard University Kennedy School of Government. ""Where they can score some political points around this corruption issue, they will try to do it."" Holder has drawn heavy criticism from Republicans over his involvement in former President Bill Clinton's last-minute pardon of Mark Rich, a major Democratic donor and billionaire financier charged with federal tax evasion. Clinton pardoned Rich in the final hours of his administration on January 20, 2001. Holder was a deputy attorney general at the time. Senate Democrats have long braced for a tough committee hearing over Holder, especially after Republicans successfully delayed its start to obtain more time to review his lengthy record in both the public and private sector. But after Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter, the judiciary committee's ranking Republican, unexpectedly took to the Senate floor Tuesday to castigate Holder over a wide range of issues -- even comparing him to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales who was forced to resign -- Democrats may have to brace for a tougher fight than they expected. ""President-elect Obama chose not to seek my advice or even to give me advance notice in my capacity as ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee,"" Specter said. ""Had he done so, I could have given him some facts about Mr. Holder's background that he might not have known."" Stephen Hess, a presidential scholar at the Brookings Institution, said it's not surprising Republicans are targeting a particular appointment. ""There always seems to be one appointee where the Senate opposition directs its firepower,"" Hess said. ""This year the designated fall guy seems to be Eric Holder. He's going to be made to grovel."" Holder played a significant role in the heavily criticized Rich pardon, having communicated with Rich's lawyers frequently before it was issued, according to the New York Times. Critics have charged that the Justice Department should have blocked the pardon, and Holder later said he wished he had handled the matter differently. Supporters of Holder say his role in the pardon was limited, but Senate Republicans, seemingly eager for at least one high-profile fight with the incoming president, are set to put the Rich pardon front-and-center when his Judiciary Committee hearing kicks off next week. For a Republican Party still reeling from a demoralizing Election Day, Holder's hearing will likely be the GOP's first chance to put heat on the president-elect in a very public way, and in the process demonstrate that it intends to stand up to the new administration despite its minority status. ""With Holder they are going to look to score some points on the evening news,"" Keyssar said. But the Rich matter is only one issue on which Republicans plan to grill Holder. Also at issue, according to Republicans, will be Holder's involvement with the Elian Gonzalez case and potential conflicts of interests with his work over the past eight years with a corporate law firm. ""There are going to be some tough questions that Holder will have to answer,"" a Senate Republican aide said. ""We want to have a fair, open discussion for his qualifications for the job."" Republicans say they are not specifically looking to block Holder's nomination, and the GOP would be unable to do so even if it tried given the Democrats' overwhelming majority in the Senate. ""We don't want to be obstructionist. It's not a partisan thing, it's about examining his qualifications to be No. 1 at Justice,"" the Republican aide said. Still, the opposition party often claims victory when it mounts a sizeable resistance to a particular nominee, as 42 Democrats did in 2001 to President Bush's first attorney general, John Ashcroft. But Obama can ultimately take solace in the fact that a new president's Cabinet appointments are rarely held up in the Senate, no matter which party controls the chamber. According to the U.S. Senate Web site, the Senate has confirmed 98 percent of all Cabinet appointments since 1798. In fact, the Senate hasn't rejected any cabinet pick for nearly 20 years. It last rejected John Tower, former President George H.W. Bush's pick for defense secretary, in 1989. Republicans also know that at a time when Americans expect Congress to confront the country's ongoing financial crisis and recent flare-ups abroad, it might be in their interest not to delay confirmation of several important posts or appear overly partisan when it comes to confirming the majority of the president-elect's appointments. ""When these things get bad, it delays the whole process,"" Hess said. ""By the time the person finally gets the person he wants it's March. Republicans don't want this to happen.""","Confirmation hearings for attorney general-designate Eric Holder begin next week .

"(CNN) -- Consumers who bought ""Caylee Sunshine"" dolls and Michael Vick dog toys were misled into believing that a portion of their purchases would go to charity, according to a lawsuit filed this week. The ""Caylee Sunshine"" doll cost $29.99 before Showbiz Promotions halted its production. The Florida Attorney General's Office filed a lawsuit Thursday against Showbiz Promotions and its owner, Jaime Salcedo, seeking $10,000 in penalties for each violation under the state's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. But Salcedo denies the allegations, saying he has been trying to resolve the disputes and compensate charitable organizations. The Jacksonville-based entrepreneur claims he has been working with the attorney general's office for more than one year to settle the issue. The suit also asks that Salcedo stop running the Web site, www.cayleedoll.com, his short-lived vehicle for selling dolls that critics said were modeled after slain Florida toddler Caylee Anthony. Salcedo says the doll was not meant to be Caylee, but rather a tribute to her memory. The dispute began with the attorney general's investigation into complaints about dog chew toys in the likeness of suspended NFL star Michael Vick, who is serving a federal prison sentence for his role in a dogfighting operation. Consumers said they ordered and paid for merchandise from the company but did not receive the items, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit also claims that Showbiz Promotions told consumers that a portion of the proceeds would go to local animal shelters, another promise Salcedo allegedly never made good on. ""Defendant Salcedo began cooperating with the Attorney General and made attempts to either make delivery on consumer orders for the Vick Dog Chew Toy or to provide refunds. However, numerous consumer complaints remain unresolved,"" the complaint alleges. But Salcedo claims the scope of the damage is less extensive. Of 200 complaints that he says the attorney general's office received, all but 10 were resolved. ""Those people purchased on PayPal, so the only way I had to get in touch was going though e-mail. If they don't respond, then I can't help them,"" he said in a telephone interview Friday. Salcedo also insists that his company made donations to animal shelters in forms of merchandise, including Vick chew toys, T-shirts and hats. ""They'd rather have $100 in toys because they can sell them or auction them off,"" he said. ""We said they could have either and every time they said they wanted the toys."" The suit also addresses Salcedo's promotion of the Caylee Sunshine Doll and other members of the Sunshine Doll Collection, including Gracie Sunshine and Hope Sunshine. The dolls set off a firestorm of controversy with its launch in January, drawing allegations that Showbiz Promotions was attempting to profit off the death of Caylee Anthony, whose mother is facing trial for her murder. Members of the public, media pundits and the Anthony family called for production of the dolls to be halted. One month later, Showbiz Promotions pulled the plug on the Sunshine Collection, citing high manufacturing costs and tepid consumer response. The company had fulfilled just five orders and provided refunds for 20, according to Salcedo. The lawsuit alleges that the product's Web site, www.cayleedoll.com, falsely claimed that ""100% of the profits"" from the Sunshine Doll Collection would go to charity, accusing Salcedo of fabricating a donation receipt and posting it on the site so visitors could view ""the first donation"" made to charity. The receipt -- a purported screen grab from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's Web site -- shows an ""online credit card donation confirmation"" for $5,000 in the name of Showbiz Promotions, according to the lawsuit. Salcedo says he never posted any such image on the site. The alleged receipt is attached as an exhibit to the lawsuit, along with another purported receipt in Salcedo's name that the attorney general's office says is the only existing NCMEC donation associated with Salcedo or Showbiz Promotions. See exhibits attached to the lawsuit . ""The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children confirmed that their records showed that a donation was made by Jaime Salcedo on March 12, 2009 at [5:28 p.m.] in the amount of $10,"" the lawsuit states. ""The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children confirmed that they had no record of a donation from Showbiz Promotions in any amount or any additional donation from Jaime Salcedo."" Salcedo insists that the receipt for $5,000 is not real -- and says his company had nothing to do with it. ""They're saying this was posted on our Web site and clearly it was not. That is clearly something that someone made and sent to them and they're jumping the gun,"" he said. Furthermore, he does not deny making a $10 donation to NCMEC out of his own pocket. ""We had nothing left to give to charity apart from what I give every year, which is $10,"" he said. ""If giving $10 every year to charity is a crime, then I'm guilty.""","Showbiz Promotions and its owner accused of misleading consumers .

Ironically, the comments that offended Canadians included Thornton's assessment that they were ""very reserved"" and ""it doesn't matter what you say to them.""

"MADISON COUNTY, Virginia (CNN) -- Amidst the tranquility of a fishing trip at the Rose River Farm in Madison County, a wounded warrior says he almost feels ""semi-normal again."" Retired Navy Capt. Ed Nicholson's Project Healing Waters Fly Fishing helps rehabilitate wounded servicemembers. The amputee is one of about 1,000 servicemen and veterans who have reaped the benefits of the therapeutic art of fly-fishing, with the help of retired Navy Capt. Ed Nicholson. ""The demons of war, you just don't set them aside,"" says Nicholson, 67. ""But once you get out on the river, the serenity is incredibly healing."" While recovering from cancer surgery at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in 2004, Nicholson witnessed wounded and disabled men and women -- many of them amputees -- struggling with their injuries. ""Other than being in Vietnam and seeing people in the process of getting hurt, I never really had a full appreciation for the recovery part and what happened after they came home. My recovery was nothing compared to what they were facing. It planted the seed that maybe there's something I could do,"" Nicholson says. The solution was obvious to Nicholson, who says being an outdoorsman is in his blood: Get them out of the hospital and into nature. Through free classes and outings, Nicholson's organization, Project Healing Waters Fly Fishing, helps rehabilitate injured and disabled servicemembers and veterans. ""We would run these classes that would better prepare them to be fishermen when the weather got nice and we could move outside, start casting lessons and go fishing,"" he says. Nicholson and ty flying instructor John Colburn saw that the discipline of tying flies, which requires patience and training, benefited veterans recovering from injuries. And it helped them relax. ""You have a guy who lost a leg and we get him out there wading in a stream -- he gets a boost. Or a guy who lost an arm, we start him casting. He has a chance to use his new arm and actually do something that's enjoyable,"" says Nicholson. Do you know someone who should be a CNN Hero? Nominations are open at CNN.com/Heroes .

Watch Nicholson as he helps wounded soldiers through fly-fishing » . First Lt. Ferris Butler, an active participant in Project Healing Waters, agrees. ""If you compound losing body parts with losing friends, just getting in the water is a release,"" he says, adding that fishing gave him enhanced dexterity because it helped him learn to walk on prosthetics in the water. Since 2005, Nicholson's program has grown to more than 50 locations nationwide with ""more to come,"" he says. With support from The Federation of Fly Fishers and Trout Unlimited, the group is establishing long-term relationships with hospital and military staff, participants and volunteers. Participants across the country can attend outings during the spring, summer and fall. An indoor component focuses on classroom activities. Nicholson, who rises early and spends the better part of his day running operations for his organization, once thought he'd spend his golden years enjoying his favorite pastimes: fishing and hunting. But he says he welcomes the direction his life has taken. ""I'm doing something that gives me as much satisfaction and gratification of anything that I've really done. I loved serving my country.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- The man police say was driving drunk when he ran a red light and struck a car, killing a Major League Baseball pitcher and two others has been charged with murder. Fans gather around a memorial for Los Angeles Angels pitcher Nick Adenhart on Friday. Andrew Thomas Gallo, 22, was charged with three counts of murder, driving under the influence and leaving the scene of a crime, the Orange County district attorney's office announced Friday. Los Angeles Angels pitcher Nick Adenhart was among those killed in the crash in Fullerton, California, early Thursday morning. Adenhart was beginning his first full season in the majors and had pitched his fourth Major League game hours earlier. Gallo, whose blood-alcohol level was three times the legal limit, according to police, faces up to life in prison if convicted on all charges. According to the DA's office, Gallo was driving a minivan 65 mph in a 35 mph zone at about 12:35 a.m. Thursday. He was on probation and his license had been suspended after a previous drunk-driving charge.  Watch Adenhart's agent describe his friend » . Authorities say he ran a red light and hit the car Adenhart was in, killing the pitcher, 20-year-old California State University student Courtney Stewart and law student Henry Pearson, 25. A fourth victim, 24-year-old John Wilhite, a former baseball player at California State, remained in critical condition Friday. A driver in a third car suffered minor injuries. Adenhart died at UC Irvine Medical Center, where he underwent surgery, according to spokesman John Murray. The Angels' game Thursday night with the Oakland A's was postponed at the direction of MLB Commissioner Bud Selig. ""Major League Baseball is in mourning today upon the news of this tragedy that has taken Angels pitcher Nick Adenhart and two others,"" Selig said in a statement that accompanied the announcement. ""Nick was just 22 years of age, with a wonderful life and career ahead of him."" After the wreck, Gallo fled the scene, according to the district attorney. He was captured about 30 minutes later. Adenhart pitched in a game against the Oakland A's Wednesday night in Anaheim, California, making what was characterized as a ""brilliant effort"" despite the Angels' 6-4 loss, according to Major League Baseball's Web site, MLB.com. In his fourth major league start, Adenhart pitched a scoreless six innings, allowing seven hits, three walks and five strikeouts. ""The Angels family has suffered a tremendous loss today,"" Tony Reagins, the team's general manager, said in a written statement. ""We are deeply saddened and shocked by this tragic loss.

"(CNN) -- A former Utah policeman is a suspect in at least three of Monday's four rush-hour shootings near Dallas, Texas, including one of two fatal attacks, police said Tuesday. CNN affiliate KSL in Salt Lake City, Utah, provided this file photo of the Dallas suspect, Brian Smith. The suspect, Brian Smith, tried to commit suicide after the Monday-evening shootings and was in a hospital in serious condition, Dallas police detective Lt. Craig Miller said. Police used ballistic tests to link Smith, a Utah state police officer for 12 years, to the shootings in which one driver was killed, one was injured by shattered glass and one escaped uninjured, Dallas police detective Lt. Craig Miller said. Miller said it is unclear if Smith was involved in the other fatal shooting, which was the first attack of the evening. Four motorists were attacked along a three-mile stretch near and on the LBJ Freeway, about 10 miles northeast of downtown Dallas, on Monday evening, police said. The first attack, which happened in Garland, Texas, about 5:41 p.m., killed Jorge Lopez. Garland police said Lopez, 20, was sitting in his Nissan at a traffic light when a man in a pickup pulled alongside him and fired shots into his car, killing him.   A few minutes after the Garland shooting and two miles away on LBJ Freeway, a gunman fired at two tractor-trailers. While one driver escaped injuries, William Scott Miller, 42, of Frankfort, Kentucky, was shot to death behind the wheel of a United Van Lines truck, police said. ""He was going to be traveling home,"" Craig Miller said. ""He was about to park his rig. He was going to get on a plane to fly to be with his wife and children for the Christmas season and then come back to this location."" Miller called the truck driver a hero, saying he was able to control his rig before he died -- preventing other motorists from being hurt. The fourth attack came a mile west on LBJ Freeway when gunfire shattered the windshield of another tractor-trailer. The bullets missed the driver, but flying glass caused minor cuts, police said. Miller said video from the Garland shooting is available, and specialists were trying to enhance it to bring out details. Businesses along the other routes also may have video that will help police, he said. A friend of Lopez's said he was ""a straight-up good guy, never had problems with anybody, never started anything with anybody."" ""So that's why this seems so out of the blue,"" Lopez's friend said.","NEW: Former Utah state police officer named a suspect some of Monday's shootings .

"(CNN) -- A tornado descended on Murfreesboro, Tennessee Friday, killing two people and injuring another 30, an official said. Powerful tornado winds ripped through Murfreesboro, Tennessee, Friday, leaving a trail of destruction. Two people were critically injured by the tornado, which hit the city, located about 30 miles southeast of Nashville, around 1:40 p.m., Donnie Smith, public information officer with the Tennessee Department of Emergency Management in Nashville said. The search-and-rescue effort was continuing into the evening, Smith said, ""so it's possible that may not be all."" Many homes were damaged, others were destroyed and power lines were down across Murfreesboro, said Randy White, a public information officer with Rutherford County Emergency Management. The bad weather began around noon, when a band of severe thunderstorms swept across the state from the southwest, Smith said. Elsewhere in the region, the town of Mena, Arkansas, is cleaning up after a tornado roared through, killing three people and damaging or destroying more than 100 homes, an Arkansas official said. The town looked like a ""war zone"" as soldiers from the Arkansas National Guard went house to house searching for victims of the twister that hit Thursday night, said Capt. Christopher Heathscott. About 50 soldiers also helped with security and food distribution. Gov. Mike Beebe planned to fly over Mena on Friday afternoon. Mena, population 6,000, took a heavy hit on the west side of town, as the storm swept through downtown before heading up state Highway 71, said Tommy Jackson from the state Department of Emergency Management. ""It looks like a war zone out here,"" said James Reeves, also from the department.  Watch scenes of devastation in Mena » . The tornado damaged the county hospital, Mena City Hall, a middle school, churches, a library, the Masonic lodge and the courthouse -- which houses the 911 emergency dispatch center and a detention center, Reeves said. He said electricity and gas were out in the western half of the city. Two plants at an industrial park were destroyed, said reporter Charles Crowson of CNN affiliate KTHV-TV. He said utility crews were trying to stop a gas leak there. Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd told Crowson the county detention center was ""uninhabitable."" There were 18 inmates in the jail at the time of the tornado, and they were moved to neighboring jurisdictions, he said. iReport.com: Are you there? Send photos, video . There were 24 reports of tornadoes in the area Thursday night, said CNN meteorologist Rob Marciano, and wind gusts reached more than 70 mph. ""So a significant severe weather event last night, and we expect similar action later on today, although it's all moving to the east,"" he said Friday morning. ""It went from Oklahoma across the border toward Arkansas."" Winds will continue to be gusty until later in the afternoon, Marciano said. As the storms moved east, thunderstorms were predicted, and there was a chance for more tornadoes. Large hail and damaging winds were predicted for the Southeast later Friday. In Mena, officials set up three shelters, but fewer than 50 people had sought refuge in them. In this rural community, most people are staying with friends and family, Reeves said. All three victims were elderly, officials said. A man and a woman died when houses collapsed, and another woman died after being struck by debris. Beebe sent 30 National Guard soldiers to the town Thursday, and 20 more are expected Friday.

"(CNN) -- A 93-year-old World War II medic who froze to death last month in his Bay City, Michigan, home left his entire estate to a local hospital, an estate attorney told CNN Wednesday. Martin Schur poses with his wife, Marian, in 1976. Local and state officials agree that Schur's death was avoidable. The attorney would not disclose the exact amount left behind by Martin Schur. But his nephew said his uncle indicated to family members two years ago that he had saved up more than a half-million dollars over the years. Schur and his wife, Marian, who died more than a year ago, did not have any children. ""I just know at one time he said he had over $600,000 in savings,"" said William Walworth. ""That's what he told me and my brother, and he was proud that he was able to save and build his estate up to that."" Cathy Reder, an attorney negotiating on behalf of Bay Regional Medical Center and the Schur family, said she was filing paperwork in probate court Wednesday for the court to determine the validity of the will. A hearing has been set for March 17. Reder would not specify the amount left to the hospital, other than to say it's more than $1. ""The will leaves everything to Bay Medical Center,"" she said. The hospital had no immediate comment. Walworth said his uncle was a frugal man who hadn't eaten at a restaurant for over 30 years. ""He was very tight, and he was very frugal. But he did manage to save a lot of money."" He said it's possible his uncle's estate could be less than $600,000, but he believes it's still ""sizable."" ""Knowing my uncle, that's him,"" Walworth said. ""He loved his community. He loved Bay City, Michigan."" He added, ""Hopefully his death is not in vain and we can learn from this, and he's still able to save lives. ... He was a very unique, special person in my life. I'm proud of what he was able to do in his life."" He said he hopes his uncle's message will spur others to ""look out for their neighbor."" The size of the estate -- if it's as large as the nephew believes -- adds another tragic twist to Schur's death. The power company limited his electricity because he owed about $1,000.  Watch neighbor say the death is ""unforgivable"" » . Schur's death last month shocked Bay City, a town of about 37,000 on Lake Huron's Saginaw Bay. The World War II veteran's frozen body was found in his home January 17, just four days after a device that regulates how much power he uses -- installed because of failure to pay -- shut off his power. A medical examiner said the temperature was 32 degrees in the house when Schur's body was found. The medical examiner told The Bay City Times that Schur died a ""slow, painful death."" ""It's not easy to die from hypothermia without first realizing your fingers and toes feel like they're burning,"" Dr. Kanu Virani told the paper. The Michigan State Police launched an investigation into Schur's death for possible criminal violations. ""We have to do everything we can to make sure this doesn't happen again, whether it's Bay City or in any one of the cold weather states,"" Bay City Mayor Charles Brunner said last week. The death has prompted a review of Bay City Electric Light & Power's rules and procedures for limiting or cutting off power. It also resulted in Bay City residents protesting Monday to the city about its handling of the whole situation. A neighbor who lives down the street called Schur's death ""unforgivable."" ""This can't be allowed to happen in this country,"" said Jerome Anderson. Walworth said he believes his uncle's death was ""preventable."" ""It should never have happened. It's a tragic loss,"" he said. ""I had a lot of fond memories of my uncle, and that's the type of memory I don't want to have: Him freezing to death."" Utility officials said Schur owed about $1,000 resulting in a ""limiter"" being put on his home. Limiters are devices that cut power as a warning for people who haven't paid their bills. Limiters can be reset to restore a lesser degree of power until a bill payment is worked out. In Schur's case, the limiter was never reset, and it's unclear whether he knew how to do that. Schur had been living alone since his wife died, Walworth said. Unlike private utilities regulated by the state, Bay City runs and oversees its own utilities and therefore doesn't fall under Michigan's public service commission. By law, Michigan requires private companies to prohibit cutting off service to senior citizens between November and April. Seniors must register for the program. The city has begun questioning whether its rules and procedures for limiting or cutting off power need a major overhaul. The utility has stopped its practice of cutting power to customers who don't pay their bills. The utility also has removed all ""limiters"" on homes. Walworth said someone should have looked at Schur's payment history and made direct contact to see whether something was wrong. He's hoping the nation will learn from his uncle's death. ""Hopefully, some good can come out of this. I'm still an optimist.""

"(CNN) -- There is a lot of excitement around the potential of ""stereoscopic"" movies (""3-D"" to you and me). Much of it has been drummed up by director James Cameron's forthcoming blockbuster ""Avatar"" and Dreamworks boss Jeffery Katzenberg, who is releasing more than a dozen 3-D pictures this year. The title character looks over a note from her ""other parents"" in ""Coraline."" After seeing ""Beowulf"" and ""Journey to the Center of the Earth,"" two recent entries in the 3-D sweepstakes, it was easy to conclude that this fad wouldn't last any longer than it did last time around, in the 1950s. But after seeing the captivating ""Coraline,"" the first stereoscopic stop-motion animated feature, I've changed my mind. Maybe this really is the next phase for motion pictures -- and what's more, maybe that's not such a bad thing. In the hands of ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" director Henry Selick, 3-D isn't a gimmick or the ocular equivalent of an obstacle course. It's an aesthetic enhancement, layering the story and literally bringing depth and texture to the visuals. Adapted by Selick from Neil Gaiman's novella (the same Neil Gaiman who co-scripted ""Beowulf,"" incidentally), ""Coraline"" is a contemporary fairy tale about a bored, blue-haired 11-year-old kicking around a big old house in rainy, empty Oregon. Her parents are writers. They basically leave her to her own devices, so when Coraline (voiced by Dakota Fanning) discovers a diminutive door hidden behind the wallpaper, her mom (Teri Hatcher) agrees to fish out the key, revealing ... a brick wall. It's only at night, when she dreams, that the door magically opens to a tunnel, and Coraline passes through to the house next door: a fabulous mirror image of her own home, right down to an identical mom and dad. Identical, except that these parents give her pancakes, presents and their full attention. That, and the buttons stitched into their skulls where their eyes should be. Any parent will immediately recognize that this ""other mother"" and ""other father"" are too good to be true (they're prettier and more talented, and they obviously don't work for a living), but Coraline is entranced by the dazzling, super-saturated night-world, with its garden of snapping dragons, a circus of performing mice and all the treats she can eat. In her dreams, the grass isn't just greener -- it's emerald. In one of Selick's embellishments on the novel, there's a facsimile of the only other child in the valley. He's an irritating boy named Wybie, who's very much improved in his all-smiling, mute incarnation, in Coraline's opinion. At least until he musters up a scowl ... Selick's movie can be intense and even disturbing; it could easily freak out impressionable adults, let alone their offspring. But I prefer to think of it as a feel-good movie for overworked parents. There's also a redoubtable talking cat (voiced by Keith David) to ensure that everything will come out all right. Tapping into primal fantasies and fears, the film also echoes classic fantasy stories from the Brothers Grimm, Lewis Carroll and L. Frank Baum. The tunnel suggests the rabbit hole Alice fell down, and the crazy mirror manner in which the ""other"" world reflects back on reality reminds us of the doubling of actors in the film version of Oz. ""Coraline"" isn't perfect. I could have done without either the downstairs neighbors -- two elderly showgirls -- or the acrobatic Russian barker upstairs (a little carny goes a long way). But the whimsy is always offset with comic mischief and the menace of Hatcher's genuinely creepy Other Mother. The model work is extraordinary in its eccentric, jury-rigged genius. A shower spouts rusty water -- fabricated from plastic, apparently. And if you examine the blooms in Other Father's garden too closely, you might see they have been fashioned from popcorn. You can't taste it -- not yet -- but in its 3-D incarnation (about half the movie's release prints will be in traditional 2-D), you'll feel you could reach out and touch. With an dreamily sinister and seductive score by Bruno Coulais, ""Coraline"" never stops taking artistic risks. I hope there's a brave enough audience out there willing to take the plunge. ""Coraline"" runs 100 minutes and is rated PG. For Entertainment Weekly's take, click here.","""Coraline"" makes the most of its 3-D -- and its clever, creative storytelling .

"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- Key Illinois Democratic legislators are circulating a letter urging support for the impeachment of Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who was arrested this week on federal corruption charges relating in part to the selection of President-elect Barack Obama's successor as a U.S. senator. Barack Obama says he has never spoken with Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich about the vacant Senate seat. State Rep. John Fritchey, head of the House Civil Judiciary Committee, sent the letter Thursday asking Democratic colleagues to say by Friday whether they support a move for impeachment and would like to be added as a co-sponsor of legislation. Blagojevich also is a Democrat. ""Faced with a significant budget shortfall, a national recession, and a vacant United States Senate seat, we cannot afford to allow Illinois to operate without effective leadership in the [Illinois] executive branch,"" said the letter, also signed by Reps. Thomas Holbrook, David Miller and James Brosnahan. ""Simply put, it is imperative to replace Gov. Blagojevich as soon as is practicable."" The letter said the impeachment filing was being prepared, and the lawmakers said they expected the process -- the state House would bring charges against Blagojevich and he would be tried by the state Senate -- would take ""a matter of weeks rather than months."" The lawmakers' move coincided with increasing calls for Blagojevich's resignation. President-elect Barack Obama called again Thursday for Blagojevich to step down, saying the embattled governor can no longer effectively serve the people of Illinois.  Watch as Obama says Senate seat belongs to the people » . ""I hope that the governor himself comes to the conclusion that he can no longer effectively serve and that he does resign,"" Obama said, speaking before announcing his pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle. Obama said he was as ""appalled and disappointed as anyone"" by the allegations against the Democratic governor, and said he was confident his staff was not involved in the alleged scandal. Federal officials said Blagojevich was looking to sell or trade Obama's open seat in the U.S. Senate. Obama said he had never spoken to the governor on the subject, adding he was confident that ""no representatives of mine would have any part of any deals related to this seat."" He had asked his staff to gather the facts of any contacts with the governor's office about the vacancy, he said. ""This Senate seat does not belong to any politician to trade. It belongs to the people of Illinois, and they deserve the best possible representation,"" he said. ""They also deserve to know that any vacancy will be filled in an appropriate way so that whoever is sent to Washington is going to be fighting for the people of Illinois."" Earlier Thursday, Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan said she is prepared to go to the Illinois Supreme Court to have Blagojevich declared unfit to serve if he does not resign.  Explainer: Federal complaint against Blagojevich » . ""Obviously the easiest way for us to move on in the state of Illinois is for Gov. Blagojevich to do the right thing for the people and to resign,"" she told CNN's ""American Morning."" She added, ""If he fails to, the two other options are obviously the Legislature moving forward on impeachment, or I have the opportunity to actually go to our Illinois Supreme Court and ask them to declare, basically, that our governor is unable to serve,"" she said. In that case, Lt. Gov. Pat Quinn, a Democrat, would become acting governor, she said. Madigan said she won't wait long to take action. ""We would like a signal from the Legislature if they're going to move forward on impeachment proceedings. ... I think there are obviously numerous members of the Legislature calling for impeachment proceedings,"" she said, noting that the Legislature, which is adjourned, will meet Monday to discuss the possibility of holding a special election for Obama's successor. Fritchey, in the letter to Democratic lawmakers, commended Madigan's willingness to go to the Supreme Court, but said ""both the duration as well as the outcome of such a proceeding are inherently uncertain and speculative.""  Watch what was in the complaint against Blagojevich » . ""We would also note the comments of the attorney general indicating her support of impeachment proceedings as an appropriate course of action at this time,"" the letter said. Quinn said at a news conference earlier Thursday that the governor had lost the confidence of the people. ""I think the governor has one duty right now and that's the duty to resign,"" he said. Should he became governor, Quinn indicated he might lean toward appointing a successor to Obama's seat, saying an election would be expensive and time-consuming. ""Time is of the essence for all of us in America right now, to make sure we get our economy on the straight path to recovery,"" he said. Blagojevich -- who is free on his own recognizance -- returned to work Wednesday, his 52nd birthday. He has not commented on the charges, but his lawyer, Sheldon Sorosky, told reporters Tuesday night that his client ""feels he didn't do anything wrong."" Sorosky said, ""He hopes the people of Illinois have faith in him, because he will be vindicated."" White House Press Secretary Dana Perino said Thursday that President Bush believes the governor's arrest marks a ""very serious situation,"" and he believes the charges are ""astounding."" Some details of the alleged scandal became clearer Wednesday, as a law enforcement official close to the investigation identified Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. as the person referred to in the federal criminal complaint as Senate Candidate 5. Of the six candidates mentioned in the complaint, Candidate 5 is the only one whom Blagojevich said engaged in discussion through an emissary about possibly raising money for the governor in exchange for the Senate position. Jackson firmly denied wrongdoing at a Wednesday news conference. ""I reject and denounce 'pay to play' politics and have no involvement whatsoever in any wrongdoing,"" he said. ""I did not initiate or authorize anyone at any time to promise anything to Gov. Blagojevich on my behalf. I never sent a message or an emissary to the governor to make an offer, to plead my case or to propose a deal about a U.S. Senate seat. Period."" The law enforcement official said there was no evidence -- other than the governor's taped remarks -- that Jackson or others on his behalf ever approached the governor in an improper way. The official also emphasized that no conversations with Jackson were picked up on bugs or wiretaps, and there is no evidence that he was aware of anything improper. According to the complaint, Blagojevich and his chief of staff, John Harris -- who was also arrested Tuesday on federal corruption charges -- were ""conspiring to obtain personal financial benefits"" for Blagojevich by leveraging his sole authority to appoint a U.S. senator to replace Obama. Federal investigators also allege the two were trying to have Chicago Tribune editorial board members fired by leveraging state assistance to the parent company of the newspaper, the Tribune Company, in its sale of Wrigley Field.  Explainer: Illinois governor is in hot water » . The governor and his chief of staff are also accused of sullying other areas of state business: trying to rescind $8 million of state funds to Chicago's Children's Memorial Hospital because the hospital's chief executive officer had not contributed $50,000 to Blagojevich, and expecting a highway contractor to raise $500,000 in contributions in exchange for money for a tollway project. ""Because of the unimaginable allegations that were in the federal complaint, it really calls into question absolutely everything that the governor has authority to do,"" Madigan said Thursday on CNN's ""Situation Room."" She said she had spoken to the governor only once this year, and perhaps not at all last year.  Watch whom Blagojevich has considered » . ""That sounds incredible, because I do serve as attorney general, so I'm the lawyer for the state, but we've been well aware for years that there are problems with this governor and so I haven't had anything to do with him,"" she said.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Annie Lennox has incredible eyes. Annie Lennox's new album, a best-of, will be her last with Sony. They're a translucent blue-green, both kind and inviting in one glance, then piercing and all-knowing in another. At 54, Lennox's orbs are as captivating today as they were when they stared at us from under that fiery orange crew cut in the music video for the Eurythmics hit ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)."" That was 1983. Yes, Lennox's Eurythmics days seem like a lifetime ago for the Scotland-born singer-songwriter, especially when you consider the successful solo career she's enjoyed since her partnership with Dave Stewart. It's that body of work -- songs like 'Why"" and ""No More 'I Love You's' "" that are showcased on her newest album, ""The Annie Lennox Collection."" It's Lennox's fifth solo outing, and her final album with her record label of 30 years, Sony Music Entertainment. ""It's like a demarcation line in a way because there is that body of work to look back on in retrospect,"" says Lennox. ""And the future is ahead of me and that's very interesting because I'm really not sure exactly what that's going to mean logistically ... how that's going to pan out. But I'm very excited about it because of Internet technology.""  Watch Lennox talk about catharsis » . Lennox, who's won Grammys, BRIT Awards and an Academy Award (for co-writing ""Into the West"" from ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King""), says she's become somewhat of a voracious blogger, using her MySpace page and official Web site not only as a repository for her musical work, but also to lend a voice to her humanitarian efforts. In 2007, Lennox formed the SING Campaign, a nonprofit initiative to help fight the HIV pandemic in Africa. The initiative has its own anthem, called ""SING,"" which features vocals from Madonna and Celine Dion among others, and is included on Lennox's new album. She also recorded two new tracks to celebrate the release, one a cover of Irish band Ash's hit song ""Shining Light."" ""It's one of those incredible anthemic songs that just stay with you,"" she says. ""It's like when you heard Jeff Buckley's version of Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah.' It's almost like a revelation when you hear it."" Lennox spoke to CNN about tapping into her inner divas to make those theatrical music videos, the pitfalls of fame and why she celebrates her naiveté. CNN: Who is your ""shining light""? Annie Lennox: Ordinary people who don't necessarily have the spotlight shone on them, who do extraordinary things. Those people always inspire me. A lot of people that are working in nongovernmental organizations inspire me very much, because I think those people are really risking life and limb to make a difference to people's lives in really impossible circumstances. And they really give me the sense that if they can do that, I can do something, too. CNN: How do you feel about where you are in life right now? Lennox: Of course now I'm in that middle-age place, age-wise, and youth is no longer really something that I'm a part of anymore. And that started happening for me when I was about 40, to be honest with you. I had my kids and my focus went elsewhere. And I think I've changed so much through having children ... inside myself. It's been a kind of evolution and a maturity. And that has informed the SING Campaign a lot, because my focus is really on women. ... I understand what it is for a woman to want to protect their children and give them the best they can. And so I identify with that. ... I can let go of some of the things I was maybe focused on when I was younger and I'm focused on different things. CNN: Over the years your music videos have served as an outlet to explore different personas. Is that a cathartic experience for you? Lennox: Performance feels quite cathartic, to be honest with you. It's a good feeling. And songwriting is cathartic because you have something you want to express. ... Ultimately when you've completed that songwriting process there is a sense of yes ... completion. It's out. It's expressed. It's done. And then you can communicate it to other people in performance. CNN: You come across as extremely fearless in your videos. Yet you've said as a person you're quite shy. You don't seem shy to me. Lennox: No I'm not shy right now, but I can be quite shy. It depends on the circumstances. ... Shyness is actually quite crippling. When one is shy it's not helpful. But a lot of being on stage has given me that opportunity to go beyond my normal persona. CNN: Which music video are you most proud of? Lennox: Quite a few. I think that ""Broken Glass"" is just ... it's hilarious. A lot of the things I do have got humor in them. But the fact that we had John Malkovich who came in and Hugh Laurie who was there ... we had a big cast. CNN: A lot of your songs are about pain and failed relationships. Do you still feel that you have a lot to learn about love? Lennox: I think we all do. I think the world needs to be a far more loving place. And I think we are confused between erotic love [and] unconditional love. I think our sexuality is a very different thing from our love. ... We are a society fixated with sexuality and it can be very cruel. When the love, and the respect and the consideration [are] missing, people live very isolated existences. CNN: What has fame taught you? Lennox: I think fame for fame's sake is a very toxic thing. ... And people in this society have this idea that they wanna be famous, and they don't know what for. And they pursue ""celebrity"" for itself. I would say that without something to offer, whether it be that you're an actor, you have a craft, you have something to offer people, if you're a writer, a painter, a musician ... when it's just about you and your actual life it's a little bit cannibalistic. The industry of celebrity is quite a savage one and when you fall foul of it, and your privacy is so brutally invaded ... you may be having difficulties in your own life as we all do ... and all the images of you, your dogs, your children, the inside of your house ... they're all splattered across every front page, I think that's [a] very unhealthy place to be. And I think it's sad that people caught it so vociferously. CNN: Well you obviously raised two children. How difficult was it to shield them from your fame? Lennox: It hasn't been too difficult. Part of my work is public, but I make a distinction between that and who I am as a person in private. ... I was very careful that ... I wasn't telling stories to gossip papers, and showing my life and [my children] were gently kept away from that. CNN: Fame also serves as a useful platform, and you've been very involved with various charities, notably HIV/AIDS. Do you ever feel frustrated that you you're not making as big a difference as you would like? Lennox: I had to think about this very carefully because I understand that there are so many problems in the world. Infinitely. And there always will be. That will never change, no. ... And if you make this decision to get involved, don't think that there's just an end result and that's what you're aiming for. No, it's the day-to-day commitment. It's the small steps that really count, in my opinion. CNN: I've read that you consider yourself to be quite naive. Is that still true? Lennox: I still have an aspect of naiveté, and I think it's a valuable thing, because if I was jaded and cynical 100 percent as I could be, you know I would be less human and I think my acknowledgment that I can be naive is fine. It's part of being human.","New Annie Lennox CD is a best-of collection; it's her last album with Sony .

"(CNN) -- Donald Trump, businessman and CEO of The Trump Organization, knows a little something about money. Donald Trump says President Obama is trying to solve the nation's economic woes, but it's ""trial and error."" Trump spoke with CNN's Larry King about whether there should be executive pay limits, if there should be a stimulus plan and when there could be an end to the economic downturn. The following is an edited portion of the interview. Larry King: Is Obama right or wrong to go after these executives with salary caps? Donald Trump: Well, I think he's absolutely right. Billions of dollars is being given to banks and others. You know, once you start using taxpayer money, it's a whole new game. So I absolutely think he's right. King: What about the whole concept of bailouts? Trump: Well, it's a little bit different. A lot of people are not in favor of bailouts. You know, we talked about all the different things going on in this country. Let's face it, Larry, we are in a depression. If they didn't do the bailout, you would be in depression No. 2 and maybe just as big as depression No. 1, so they really had to do something. The problem is they're giving millions and billions of dollars to banks and the banks aren't loaning it. If you are a prime customer of a bank and if you need 10 cents, you can't get it. The banks are out of business. They're not loaning. Now, billions of dollars has been given. They're supposed to be loaning out that money and they're using it for other purposes, so it is a real mess. King:  If you were in the Senate, would you vote for the stimulus plan? Trump: Well, I'd vote for a stimulus plan. I'm not sure that all of the things in there are appropriate. Some of the little toys that they have are not really appropriate, and they're a little surprising that they seem to want it, because the publicity on it has been terrible. I would certainly vote for a stimulus, but I would really vote for banks having to loan out the money because they're not doing that. King: In your adult career, have you ever seen it worse? Trump: No, this is the worst ever. This is the worst I've ever seen. 1990 was a bad period of time, but this is far worse, and this is worse on a really global basis. I'm looking at different countries. Every country is bad. Now they're blaming us because of what happened. You know, why not blame the United States? But every country is in trouble. King:  Can you put the blame anywhere? Trump: Well, look, it's something that, to a certain extent, happens. You go up, you go down. You have recessions. If you just look at the charts over the period of 150 years, you've had good times (and) you've had bad times. Certainly, there's been a lot of greed. There's been a lot of stupidity. You know, like I say, today the banks don't have money, they don't loan money. But if you went to a bank two years ago and you wanted a $300 million loan, they'd say 'No, we don't want to do that, but we'll give you $400 million,' so I guess, to a certain extent, that's part of the problem. King:  If you had the power, if you could wield, what would you do? Trump: Well, the biggest problem we have is it's trial and error, Larry. I mean we've never had anything like this before. It is absolute trial and error. They're trying. The new president is trying. Bush left him with a mess -- a total mess in many different ways. I really think he's doing the best he can, but it is trial and error. They try something, if it works, great. If it doesn't work -- and the problem is you don't really know if it's going to work for quite some time. If it's really wrong -- and it could be wrong -- we're going to really have a mess in two years.","Donald Trump says executives should have caps on their salaries .

"(CNN) -- Elephant seals equipped with electronic tags and robotic mini submarines using sonar were just two projects during the International Polar Year (IPY) that aimed to investigate the effects of global warming in polar regions. An elephant seal with a custom-designed electronic tag. The tags fell off when the animals molted. The fourth IPY, which began in March 2007 and actually covered two full years, ended last month, after 160 scientific projects were undertaken by researchers from over 60 countries. A joint project by the International Council for Science (ICSW) and World Meteorological Organization. (WMO), the IPY hoped to spearhead efforts to better monitor and understand the Arctic and Antarctic regions. The project had international funding of about US$ 1.2 billion over the two-year period. ""The International Polar Year 2007/2008 came at a crossroads for the planet's future,"" said Michel Jarraud, Secretary-General of WMO in a press statement. ""The new evidence resulting from polar research will strengthen the scientific basis on which we build future actions."" Researchers found that in the Arctic during the summers of 2007 and 2008, the minimum extent of year-round sea ice decreased to its lowest level since satellite records began 30 years ago. According to a report published by the IPY organizing committee in February, their research indicates that global warming is affecting Antarctica in ways not previously identified. Other evidence of climate change came from IPY research vessels that found warming waters in the Southern Ocean and an increase in melting ice that is creating fresher bottom water around the coast of Antarctica. Among efforts to study the effects of climate change on Antarctica, was aNorwegian Polar Institute project to study marine mammals. Custom-designed tags were attached to elephant seals to study the animals' habits, although researcher realized the tags could also help with field research on climate change. The electronic tags -- which fell off when the seals molted -- sent back data on temperature and salinity the oceans around Antarctica, particularly around the Fimbul Ice Shelf in east Antarctica. While ice-shelf melt has been recorded in the west of Antarctica, scientists are concerned that it could happen in the east as well. Another project to study the underside of an Antarctic glacier deployed an autonomous robot submarine. The team from the U.S. and British Antarctic Survey sent the ""Autosub"" on six missions to study the Pine Island Glacier and how changes in ocean temperature were affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Using sonar, the submarine picked its way around the glacier and sent back data that created three-dimensional maps that scientists used to determine where and how the warmth of the ocean waters was melting the glacier's base. ""If [the West Antarctic Ice Sheet] were to melt completely, global sea levels would rise by as much as 5 meters,"" said Stan Jacobs, the U.S. lead scientist on the project. ""Because so little is known about ice-sheet behavior, this research will take us a step further in understanding how ice sheets will contribute to sea-level rise.""","Scientists using robot submarines and elephant seals equipped with electronic tags .

"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Sri Lankan soldiers have seized a key rebel stronghold after launching a surprise attack early Sunday morning, the head of Sri Lanka's army announced. Sri Lankan army chief Sarath Fonseka says a key Tamil town has been taken in a national TV broadcast Sunday. Troops crossed a lagoon and entered the town of Mullaittivu before encountering heavy resistance from Tamil fighters, according to the government-run news agency. ""Our troops fought their way through a 40 km (25 mile) thick jungle track,"" Lt. Gen. Sarath Fonseka said in a televised address on Sunday. ""This is the long awaited victory and I am happy to say that our heroic forces today captured the Mullaittivu town after 12 years,"" the Sri Lanka Army chief said. There is no confirmation from the rebels that the strategic garrison has been overtaken. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) -- commonly known as the Tamil Tigers -- have fought for an independent homeland for the country's ethnic Tamil minority since 1983. The civil war has left more than 70,000 people dead. The rebels gained control over Mullaittivu in 1996 and established a military garrison there, according to the government. In recent days, the military has made significant progress in its campaign to recapture rebel strongholds. Earlier this month, troops regained control of the northern town of Elephant Pass, the point at which mainland Sri Lanka links to the northern Jaffna peninsula. It had been in rebel hands for more than nine years. The re-capture enabled the government to use a highway linking the mainland to the peninsula to move troops and supplies. Previously, it was done by air and sea. ""The area that the LTTE has dominated has shrank phenomenally,"" Sri Lankan High Commissioner to India, C.R Jayasinghe, told CNN. ""They lost... about 90 percent of what they had."" Despite major government gains, critics point to ongoing civilian casualties resultant from the conflict. ""This is an important strategic success for the army, but literally tens of thousands of people, children, are in the line of fire,"" United Nations spokesman James Elder said in a phone conversation Sunday. ""Some Sri Lankan U.N. staff are trapped there,"" he added. ""Convoys are going to the area, delivering emergency supplies, but these are not sufficient for the number of people in need."" Sri Lankan authorities are barring journalists and humanitarian aid workers from areas where heavy fighting is taking place. Amnesty International spokesman Shuransu Mishra estimated that ""over a quarter of a million of the population, mostly Tamils, are trapped between the two sides."" The organization says greater access and protection for aid workers and journalists are needed as news agencies struggle to report an accurate picture of the conflict. ""The Sri Lankan authorities are doing little to ensure the safety of the country's media, or to prosecute those responsible for murdering or attacking them,"" Amnesty International spokeswoman Yolanda Foster said in a written statement on Friday. ""They (Sri Lankan authorities) are also directly responsible for subjecting journalists to harassment and interrogation,"" she said. At least 14 journalists have been killed since the start of 2006, according to the statement. Others have been driven from the country by death threats, or in fear of detention and torture by government authorities, it said.","Rebels gained control over Mullaittivu in 1996, established a military garrison there .

"SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN) -- Instead of Apple CEO Steve Jobs, celebrity-seekers at Tuesday's Macworld keynote address had to settle for crooner Tony Bennett. And instead of blockbuster news from Apple Vice President Philip Schiller, attendees got changes in iTunes pricing, a series of software upgrades and a $2,800 17-inch notebook. Apple Vice President Philip Schiller delivers the MacWorld keynote address Tuesday in San Francisco. Among Mac users and industry observers, reaction to the 90-minute keynote, which Apple says will be its last at Macworld, was predictably mixed. ""Tony Bennett got a standing ovation. Apple, not so much,"" said Philip Elmer-DeWitt, who writes an Apple column for Fortune magazine. ""It wasn't up to Steve Jobs' standards. Phil is not the showman that Steve is, but he didn't have much material to work with."" ""I think Phil did a great job,"" countered Chuck Freedman, an IT specialist from suburban Detroit, Michigan. ""Yes, we miss Steve, but Phil handled everything well. I'm here to see what Apple's doing next, not how much weight Steve has lost."" So what is Apple doing next? Pre-Macworld rumors about an iPhone Nano and a preview of the Snow Leopard operating system proved unfounded. Instead, Schiller introduced upgrades to Apple's iLife and iWork software suites, unveiled a 17-inch unibody MacBook Pro with a more powerful battery, and announced tweaks to iTunes' 99 cents-per-song pricing model. The result earned Schiller consistent applause but not the wild cheering that greeted Jobs' 2007 announcement of the iPhone, for example.  Watch Schiller's keynote address at Macworld » . ""It was a real solid presentation,"" said Mike McGuire, a media analyst with Gartner Market Research, citing Apple's emphasis on revamping its core products amid a challenging economic climate. ""There's not the frenzied hoopla [of past years]. But maybe this isn't the best time for that."" From a consumer perspective, the day's biggest news may have been the price changes at iTunes, Apple's wildly successful online music store. Beginning April 1, songs on the site will cost $1.29, 99 cents or 69 cents, although more songs will be sold at the lower price than at the higher price, Schiller said. Apple did not elaborate on how songs will be priced, although observers expect most new hits to cost $1.29 and older songs to be cheaper. ""Apple is essentially leaving that up to the [music] labels,"" McGuire said. ""It'll be interesting to see how the labels and the artists deal with that."" After his iTunes announcement, Schiller yielded the spotlight to Bennett, who glided onstage with a four-piece band to sing ""The Best is Yet to Come"" and his signature ""I Left My Heart in San Francisco."" iReport.com: See a mobile photo from Macworld, send your own images . Attendees seemed bored during Schiller's demonstration of the revamped iWork, Apple's software for office use. Some also expressed skepticism about Apple's plans to launch a beta version of iWork.com that will allow users to review and edit documents collaboratively online. But they perked up when Schiller mentioned a new app that will let people use their iPhones as remotes to run multimedia business presentations. Audience members -- including former Vice President Al Gore, an Apple board member -- showed more enthusiasm for the upgraded iPhoto, iMovie and Garage Band software, which is bundled together as iLife '09 and goes on sale in late January. The new iPhoto has face-recognition software that will make it easier for users to create galleries of friends and family members. It also contains GPS geotagging that will allow users to sort their photos geographically. Apple is also focusing on improved video editing. ""We decided to completely rewrite iMovie and come up with a whole new version,"" Schiller said. ""We've added so much depth and so much power, we really believe it's going to be the video-editing product that everybody uses.""  Watch Schiller unveil Mac's new photo application » . The new version has better precision editing, video stabilization, easier audio editing and smoother transitions, Schiller said. The new iLife will also have a feature for aspiring musicians. Learn to Play, part of Garage Band '09, includes software for nine free basic lessons for guitar and nine free basic lessons for piano/keyboards. It also includes Artist Lessons with video instructions from such famous musicians as Sting, John Fogerty, Norah Jones and Sarah MacLachlan, who will teach users how to play their songs.  Watch Fogerty give a lesson on how to play 'Proud Mary' » . Schiller showed a video of Fogerty explaining how to play the chords for the Creedence Clearwater Revival classic ""Proud Mary."" Apple's third major announcement at the conference focused on a 17-inch unibody MacBook Pro notebook. At less than 1 inch thick and weighing in at 6.6 pounds, it would be the world's lightest notebook of its size, Schiller said. New technology will allow its battery to be recharged up to 1,000 times, more than three times the industry standard. It can last up to eight hours on a single charge and runs on less than 50 percent the energy of a single lightbulb, Schiller said. He also touted the notebook's improved screen. The new MacBook Pro will cost $2,799 and starts shipping in late January. This was the first Macworld keynote since 1997 not to be delivered by Apple CEO Steve Jobs, the tech visionary who relinquished his usual Macworld appearance last month amid concerns about his health. At past Macworlds -- the annual gathering of Mac users, consultants and partners -- fans stood for hours in lines that snaked around the block to watch Jobs unveil gadgets in his trademark jeans and black mock turtleneck. Recent Macworld keynotes introduced such major Apple products and services as iTunes (2001), the iPod Shuffle (2005) and the iPhone (2007).  See ""A decade of Macworld"" timeline » . But Apple is changing the way it does business. Thanks to its Web site and its network of retail stores, the company can reach more than 100 million customers around the world directly, which makes Apple less reliant on trade shows like Macworld to spread its message. The biggest topic of discussion at Macworld, however, was not a potential Apple product or even the contents of Schiller's speech but the mystery surrounding Jobs' absence from the trade show celebrating the company he co-founded. Attendees were heartened by Jobs' announcement Monday that his recent weight loss was caused by a hormonal imbalance that can be remedied and that he will continue as Apple's CEO while he gets treatment. Concerns about Jobs' health have hounded Apple since 2004, when he was treated for pancreatic cancer.","Conference attendees say presentation lacked star CEO's showmanship .

"(CNN) -- Two pirates in Somalia vowed revenge Monday, after the U.S. military killed three pirates and freed a U.S. ship captain who had been held hostage for several days. Crew members of the Maersk Alabama celebrate after hearing the Navy had rescued their captain from pirates. The pirates told a Somali journalist that they were angered by the U.S. action, as well as a French raid Friday that killed two pirates and one hostage and freed four hostages. ""We have decided to kill U.S. and French sailors if they happen to be among our future hostages,"" said Abdullahi Ahmed, a member of a pirate group based at Harardhere, a coastal town in central Somalia. President Obama said Monday the United States will confront pirates and hold them ""accountable for their crimes."" Obama added that he is proud of the military's actions in rescuing Capt. Richard Phillips from his pirate captors. Members of the U.S. Navy shot and killed three pirates who had been holding Phillips hostage in a lifeboat on Sunday evening, a military official said. The pirates seized Phillips after a failed attempt to hijack his ship, the Maersk Alabama. For five days the pirates held Phillips in the lifeboat as U.S. Navy ships closed in and lingered nearby. On Sunday, U.S. Navy snipers opened fire on the lifeboat after seeing one pirate point an AK-47 at the captain's back, the U.S. military said. The shootings occurred as one pirate was aboard the USS Bainbridge negotiating over Phillips' fate.  Watch how SEALs shot three pirates » . Three pirates in the lifeboat were killed. Phillips was not hurt. He was taken to another U.S. Navy vessel, the U.S. military said, where he received a medical checkup and spoke by phone with his wife in the United States.  Watch admiral tell how rescue went down » . Pirates in Somalia identified the slain men as Mohamed Ahmed Adawe, Nur Dalabey and Khalif Guled. Two of them -- Dalabey and Guled -- were among the ""most experienced men"" in a group that has hijacked seagoing vessels for money, Ahmed said. They were killed two days after the French military freed four hostages, including a child, who had been held by pirates for nearly a week on the yacht, Tanit, off Somalia's coast. In that operation, a hostage and two pirates were killed, the French Defense Ministry said, while three pirates were captured.  Watch how pirates roam a vast area of ocean » . The military actions angered Ali Nur, a pirate who is based in Gara'ad, a coastal village in the semi-autonomous region of Puntland, in northern Somalia. ""From now on, after the killings by the U.S. and France, we will add some harsher steps in our dealings with hostages, particularly American and French hostages,"" Nur told a journalist. The U.S. military acknowledged Sunday that its actions to rescue Phillips could increase the risk of violence. ""This could escalate violence in this part of the world. No question about it,"" U.S. Navy Vice Adm. Bill Gortney told reporters. Nur issued a warning to the United States. ""The killing of our boys was aggression, and the U.S. will see what they get from their operation,"" he said.","NEW: Obama promises U.S. will confront piracy .

"(CNN)  -- Another body was found in the same 92-acre parcel west of Albuquerque, New Mexico, where the remains of 10 other people have been discovered, police said Thursday. An Albuquerque, New Mexico, police forensics team member digs at the burial site. The latest discovery was made Tuesday, and the remains were recovered Wednesday, Albuquerque police spokesman John Walsh said. Like the others, it was sent to the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator, he said. A woman walking her dog found the first bodies earlier this month on the property, which had been graded in preparation for development. The graves are on about 10 acres, police spokeswoman Nadine Hamby said earlier, but that area keeps expanding. So far, 11 bodies have been found, including those of a first-trimester fetus with those of a pregnant woman. Police believe the bodies were buried sometime in the earlier part of the decade, Walsh said Thursday. Authorities have identified two of the remains, Walsh said. Body No. 8 belongs to Gina Valdez, who was born in 1982, he said. Valdez was pregnant, and the remains of her fetus were with her. Albuquerque Police Chief Ray Schultz told reporters that Valdez had a prior criminal history that included arrests for prostitution and drug charges, according to CNN affiliate KRQE-TV. Earlier, police had identified another set of remains as belonging to Victoria Chavez, a prostitute and drug user who was last seen in 2003 and reported missing in 2004. Authorities are investigating how the two women's paths may have crossed, Walsh said. Valdez's father, Dan Valdez, told KRQE she was 22 when he reported her missing four years ago. Despite her rough lifestyle, he said, ""she was my daughter and didn't deserve to be buried in the desert."" Hamby said earlier there is housing south and east of the vacant land. After rain caused flooding, surrounding neighbors complained to the developer, who made culverts to divert the water, apparently bringing the first remains to the surface.","NEW: Eleventh body found at site west of Albuquerque, New Mexico .

"(CNN) -- The battle for control of the U.S.-flagged Maersk Alabama began with a bold move by some of the crew to jump the pirates, crew members say. The crew of the Maersk Alabama exchange some words with media after the ship docked in Mombasa, Kenya. A scuffle ensued, and one of the sailors stabbed a pirate in the hand in the battle to retake the container ship, one of the sailors told CNN. Snippets of information are starting to emerge about how the Alabama's crew managed to retake the ship after it was hijacked by pirates Wednesday about 350 miles off the coast of Somalia in the Indian Ocean. The Alabama docked Saturday night in Mombasa, Kenya. Its captain, Richard Phillips, is being held by pirates in the ship's lifeboat in the Indian Ocean. Crew members smiled broadly as they stood on the ship's deck under the watchful eyes of security teams. Although they were kept away from the media, CNN's Stan Grant got close enough to ask them what happened after the pirates climbed aboard the ship. A crew member said he recalled being awakened around 7 a.m. as the hijacking began.  View a timeline of the attack and its aftermath » . ""I was scared,"" Grant quoted the man as saying. Some of the crew managed to hide in a secure part of the Alabama as the pirates stormed the ship, the sailor said. As the men described the clash, a crew member pointed to one shipmate and said, ""This guy is a hero. He and the chief engineer, they took down the pirate. ... He led him down there to the engine room and then they jumped him."" The shipmate added that he stabbed the pirate in the hand and tied him up. Another crew member shouted, ""Captain Phillips is a hero."" The father of first mate Shane Murphy on Saturday offered thanks for the ""tremendous outpouring"" of support his family has received from the public and government officials, including U.S. Sens. Ted Kennedy and John Kerry. Capt. Joseph Murphy told reporters the safe arrival of his son in Kenya is ""the best Easter present."" Joseph Murphy, an instructor at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy, said he had spoken to his son but that he didn't have details on the standoff. ""He said, 'Dad, this has been unbelievable.' He said the facts will be known very soon. He said he couldn't speak about anything,"" Joseph Murphy said. ""I said this is going to be a tough sea story to overcome. He's got a great sea story here."" Joseph Murphy said Saturday that he and the Alabama crew's primary concern was for the ship's captain. ""He's made a tremendous sacrifice for his crew. Just incredible courage. We're very, very thankful. He's done everything he could possibly do and he has saved our son,"" he said at a news conference. ""We believe that Captain Phillips will survive the situation. We want him to know he has the support of all of us -- the American people and people around the world."" Phillips became a captive sometime during the hijacking Wednesday. Since then, the destroyer USS Bainbridge has arrived on the scene to try to free Phillips with the help of the FBI. An attempt by Phillips to escape from the 28-foot covered lifeboat was thwarted by a pirate who dove into the Indian Ocean after him. Phillips' captors appear to have tied him up afterward, Pentagon officials said. The Alabama resumed its course on Thursday for Mombasa, its original destination, carrying food aid and an armed 18-person security detail. Maersk president and CEO John Reinhart told reporters Saturday that the crew will stay on board in Mombasa while the FBI conducts an investigation. The agency will look into the hijacking and hostage-taking, two law enforcement officials told CNN. The probe will be led by the FBI's New York field office, which has responsibility for looking into cases involving U.S. citizens in the African region. Reinhart said the crew has reported being in good health and that the entire crew has ""showed the professionalism of a true mariner."" ""We will make sure they're safe,"" he said. ""We know what food they want -- we'll get the food to them."" He said the crew has asked the company to do everything it can to get Phillips home safely -- an effort he said Maersk is working on with the Navy. ""That means don't make a mistake, folks,"" Reinhart said. ""We have to be perfect in our execution.""

"GUATEMALA CITY, Guatemala (CNN) -- Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom said Friday that government prosecutors are trying to determine who put microphones and video cameras in the presidential palace. Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom: ""Organized crime"" may be behind cameras found in the presidential palace. ""It's a serious allegation, it has never happened before in Guatemala,"" he told CNN en Español. He said he did not know who was responsible for the breach of security, but added, ""One of the possibilities is organized crime."" He said ""a lot of people"" had access to the palace and his office. Colom noted that Mexican President Felipe Calderon's anti-narcotrafficking efforts may have pressured drug cartels to move their smuggling to other countries, including Guatemala. Calderon said in June that his campaign against drug traffickers was working. Mexico has seized more cocaine and money from drug cartels than anywhere else in the world and this summer Mexican authorities seized at least 16,000 arms, including more than 1,000 grenades. Colom said Friday that he has already taken measures to ensure his security and that of his family. The president said that the discovery of the microphones and cameras explain, to him, some strange experiences he's had recently. He said he was in his office when the Guatemalan military called him and asked permission to seize a plane suspected of carrying illegal drugs. Within moments of approving the action, the plane disappeared. He is convinced the call was being monitored. Colom took office in January and is Guatemala's first leftist president in 53 years.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A portrait painted 400 years ago and kept anonymously in an Irish home for much of the time since is now believed to be the only painting of William Shakespeare created during his lifetime. The portrait of William Shakespeare is thought to be the ""only"" portrait painted during his lifetime. The image reveals a wealthy Shakespeare of high social status, contradicting the popular view of a struggling playwright of humble status, according to Stanley Wells, a professor who chairs London's Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. Wells, a distinguished Shakespeare scholar, arranged for three years of research and scientific testing which confirmed it was painted around 1610, when Shakespeare would have been 46 years old. ""A rather young looking 46, it has to be said,"" Wells said. Shakespeare died in 1616. The Cobbe portrait -- named after the Irish family that owns the painting -- shows Shakespeare with rosy cheeks, a full head of hair, and a reddish brown beard. The most common portrait of Shakespeare is a gray image showing a bald Bard with a small mustache and beard, and bags under his eyes. The identity of the man in the portrait was lost over the centuries -- until Alec Cobbe saw a portrait from Washington's Folger Shakespeare Library. That painting, which fell into disfavor as a Shakespeare portrait about 70 years ago, turned out to be one of four copies of Cobbe's portrait. The portrait ""shows a man wearing expensive costuming, including a very beautifully painted ruff of Italian lacework which would have been very expensive,"" Wells said. ""It establishes, for me, that Shakespeare in his later years was a rather wealthy, a rather well affluent member of aristocratic circles in the society of his time,"" Wells said. ""There's been too much of a tendency to believe that Shakespeare, being the son of a glover, coming for a small town in the middle of England, that he necessarily retained a rather humble status throughout his life."" Wells reads even more into what he sees in Shakespeare's newly-found face. ""I think it's plausible as a portrait as a good listener, of somebody who would have been capable of writing the plays, clearly the face of a man of high intelligence,"" he said. ""It's the face of a man, I think, who betrays a good deal of wisdom in his features. But, of course, as somebody (King Duncan) says in Shakespeare's story Macbeth, 'there's no art to find the mind's construction in the face.'"" It should be noted that Shakespeare's King Duncan paid a price for judging Macbeth to have the face of an honorable man. Macbeth later murdered the king. The public can read Shakespeare's face from the original painting at Shakespeare Birthplace Trust in Stratford-upon-Avon where it goes on display for several months starting April 23. The portrait then returns to the Cobbe family, which inherited it when an ancestor married England's Earl of Southampton -- a friend of Shakespeare who likely commissioned its painting.","Shakespeare group unveil ""only"" portrait of playwright painted during his lifetime .

"(CNN) -- The practice of moving research involving human subjects from wealthy countries to less wealthy countries has grown in recent years, raising a number of ethical and scientific issues that need to be addressed, researchers said in a journal article Wednesday. More and more clinical trials are being moved to less wealthy nations, a medical journal article reports. ""The question is proportionality,"" said Dr. Kevin Schulman, director of the Center for Clinical and Genetic Economics at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, and one of the study authors. ""We should test products where we are going to market them. The populations who take risks to participate in clinical research should be the ones that we anticipate will get the benefits of the research."" He and his co-authors reported in the New England Journal of Medicine that in November 2007, about one-third of clinical trials (157 of 509) were being carried out entirely outside the United States, many of them in developing countries. Between 1995 and 2005, the number of countries where such trials were being carried out more than doubled, while the number in the United States and Western Europe decreased, the researchers at Duke University said. The shift appears to have been driven at least in part by economics -- a top medical center in India charges about a tenth what a second-tier U.S. medical center would charge per case report, the authors said. Another incentive to move such work abroad: other countries' regulatory environments can be less burdensome. The authors reported one study that found only 56 percent of 670 researchers surveyed in developing countries said their work had been reviewed by a local institutional review board or a health ministry. Another study reported that 18 percent of published trials carried out in China in 2004 adequately discussed informed consent for subjects considering participating in research. In addition, recruitment of study subjects can be easier in developing countries, where a trial subject may get more than a year's pay to participate or participation could be his or her sole means of being able to get treatment, the authors said. Transparency is yet another issue. ""We know little about the conduct and quality of research in countries that have relatively little clinical research experience,"" they wrote. Schulman put it more bluntly. ""We've seen problems with people cheating on clinical trials,"" he said. He acknowledged that similar problems have arisen in the United States, but said such misdeeds were less likely to be found out when they happened abroad. Of critical importance is the fact that some populations' genetic makeup may affect their response to medication, the authors said. For example, they said, some 40 percent of people of East Asian origin have a genetic trait that impairs ethanol metabolism and limits response to nitroglycerin treatment. ""This finding may affect the relevance of trials involving cardiac, circulatory and neurologic disorders that are treated with nitroglycerin or nitric oxide-dependent therapies,"" they said. The authors called for regulations governing trials to be reduced while ensuring ethical conduct, for greater use of centralized oversight boards and for research contracts to be written using standardized terms. ""Key strategies for clinical trials should be outlined in formal clinical-development plans, publicly vetted, and submitted to regulatory agencies,"" they said. Alan Goldhammer, vice president for scientific and regulatory affairs at the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said the industry will study the suggestions and weigh whether to incorporate them. ""We're constantly taking a fresh look at all our documents and revising them as appropriate,"" he said. ""The last thing any company wants to have happen is for a trial site to be called into question and that data then not used for review by the regulatory agency, which could put its approval status in limbo."" The matter has gained in importance with the announcement by the Obama administration that the government will carry out tests to determine which drugs work best. A spokeswoman for the Food and Drug Administration, who said she could not be identified because she had not sought permission to talk to the news media, said the agency has begun training and educating regulators in countries where clinical trials are being carried out for companies that are seeking U.S. approval for their drugs.","In November 2007, one-third of clinical trials were done outside of United States .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- This year, the Oscars are on Hugh Jackman's shoulders. Hugh Jackman plans to offer viewers ""a good time"" at the Oscars. He hosts the big show Sunday night. The Australian actor, who earned rave reviews for his hosting of the Tonys, now has the Academy Awards to contend with. It's a job that's put Jon Stewart, Chris Rock, Whoopi Goldberg and David Letterman on the firing line, with only Billy Crystal and Johnny Carson emerging more or less unscathed in the last couple of decades. But with typical verve -- after all, this is the guy who won a Tony for playing song-and-dance man Peter Allen in ""The Boy from Oz"" -- Jackman cracks jokes about the task, telling ABC that one of his distinctions is that he's the ""tallest"" Oscar host in recent years. To CNN's Brooke Anderson, he was equally at ease. ""Ultimately, the way I see it is if I'm not going to have a good time, then how can anyone else have a good time,"" he said.  Watch Hugh Jackman talk about doing it the Australian way » . Even if he's not having a good time, you may not want to get in his way. After all, this is the guy who's played the fearsome, sharp-clawed Wolverine in the ""X-Men"" movies and gets a solo turn as the superhero in the forthcoming ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine."" Jackman talked with Anderson about musical numbers, Heath Ledger and performing ""drunk and nude."" The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: Are you feeling any nerves, or is it just pure excitement at this point? Hugh Jackman: It's more, it is more excitement. I'm not impervious ... there has been moments in my life where I've been nervous going on stage, that's for sure, and I know I'll have a butterfly or two, cause yeah, you wanna have a couple. But ultimately, the way I see it is if I'm not going to have a good time, then how can anyone else have a good time. You know, you're the host -- it's not really about you. Ultimately, it's your job to set the tone.  Watch Hollywood prepare for the Oscars » . CNN: And the butterflies give you a little bit of adrenaline, I would expect. Jackman: Yeah, and I'll be drinking from about 9 a.m., so that's why I'm impervious. CNN: Now you're a triple threat [a dancer, actor and singer]. I need confirmation on a couple of things. Are you doing a musical number with Beyonce? Jackman: Oh, that's a good question. Look, I'm old school, I don't want to give too much away. But I didn't fully deny it, did I? There's going to be some surprises, that's for sure. CNN: Stars of ""High School Musical"" as well? Jackman: OK, I'll give you that. Yes, they're going to be up on stage. CNN: This is really a reinvention of the Oscars this year. The ratings have been low. Traditionally a comedian hosts the show. How do you feel about being part of the reinvention this year? Jackman: I'm thrilled and honored, and that's honestly how I feel. I don't worry about the ratings or anything like that. I'm really excited by what is planned for the night, and I can tell you it's different. It really is different. I mean having someone as tall as me is a big change. ... It's really not going to be funny at all. No, but there's so many things I love about what they're doing with the show. Forget ratings, you should always reinvent -- you should always be doing something different. What this night is going to be about is spontaneity. We're going to set an atmosphere that will allow things to happen that you won't expect. And the other thing that I and the creators wanted to keep at the top and forefront of the night is that it should only happen on that night -- whatever happens, it could only happen on Oscar night, and only this year will it happen. So there's going to be some things in there where you're like, ""Oh!"" CNN:  How daring is it going to be? Will there be YouTube moments where people will be talking about the Oscars this year after it happens? Jackman: One of my favorite moments at the Oscars was when the streaker came across David Niven. And we're upping it a level and we're just going to do most of the show naked. Um, well, there hopefully will be YouTube moments. CNN: ""The sexiest man alive"" [is] going to be up there nude? Jackman: Drunk and nude, yes. So that's our new fresh approach. It's the Australian way. CNN: Are you going to work that ""sexiest man alive"" title into the show? Jackman: There's a few jokes floating around. Of course I will be about 8 feet away from two-time sexiest man alive Brad Pitt, so yes, there's great temptation to use something there. CNN: And political jokes -- will there be many of them that you will work into the act? Jackman: Hmm ... there may be some, but it won't be top-heavy. CNN: OK, so lots of surprises. You've got experience with award shows, how is this different than hosting the Tonys? Jackman: The Tony Awards is watched by more people in the theater than at home on television. So, the Oscars, it's slightly different, there's about a thousand here [in the theater] and a billion out there. But really, if I hadn't done the Tony Awards, I'd be a hell of a lot more nervous. I mean I'm trained as an actor, that's what I do, it's not like I'm trained to be a host. But having done that, the thing that I think surprised me more than anything was how much fun I had because anything can happen. You're always amongst people who are, they're pros. There's people out there, and if you played with them, they'll generally play back, and that's the thing I like about it. CNN: Heath Ledger was a fellow Australian. Do you think [it will] be a fitting tribute for him to posthumously win an Oscar? Jackman: You know of course, I can't help [but] feel sentimentally for him to be recognized. I think everyone recognizes his talent, his contributions. He was a friend of mine -- I knew him -- so I would love him to get that kind of public recognition. His family will be there; I can't help but feel that will be great. So that's the only category that I will give my preferences. I have a few others. I've had a few little sly bets going. I've got to talk to all those people backstage: Hey, I thought you should have won! CNN: How do you balance your home life with your busy schedule? Jackman: You abandon your family at this point in time. Literally, they're in New York. People have said, ""Oh, is the family coming out?"" and I've said [to my family] don't bother coming -- I leave at about 7 in the morning and I get home at about 11 at night, so right now it's Skype. God bless Skype. CNN: The kids are understanding? Jackman: Yeah, they're cool. My son, who's named Oscar by the way, he goes, ""You know what the headline should be? 'Oscar's dad hosts the Oscars.' "" And I was like, that's pretty good. Yeah, he'll stay up and watch it. iReport.com: Who do you think will win at the Oscars?","Hugh Jackman hosts Oscars on Sunday night .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President-elect Barack Obama is likely to name Steven Chu, a physicist who runs the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, as his energy secretary, three Democratic officials close to the transition said. Steven Chu explains his Nobel-winning theory on superfreezing gases in 1997. The three officials said the announcement is expected next week in Chicago, Illinois, and that Obama will also name Carol Browner, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in the Clinton administration, as the newly created ""climate czar"" inside the White House. Chu won the 1997 Nobel Prize in physics and is highly respected in energy circles. But some Democrats have privately expressed concern that Chu has no political experience as he takes on the monumental task of passing a landmark energy reform bill early next year. Although Browner is seen as a shrewd inside player who could help the incoming energy secretary navigate Capitol Hill, Obama will face questions about how effective his team will be going up against oil companies and other special interests that do not want to change the status quo. ""Energy is going to be a huge fight,"" one Democratic official said. ""They need someone with the gravitas and force of personality to make it happen."" Democrats have privately floated some other big names for energy secretary in recent days, including California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and former Secretary of State Colin Powell. But a source close to Schwarzenegger said the governor wants to serve out the rest of his term. A source close to Powell said the retired general will take ""no formal Cabinet role"" in an Obama administration but is leaving the door open to an informal troubleshooting role -- such as Mideast envoy -- if the incoming president has a specific mission that needs to be filled. iReport.com: What do you think of Obama's cabinet picks so far? Energy is one aspect of the president-elect's one-year goal to create 2.5 million jobs by 2011. The plan, which Obama announced Saturday, aims to put Americans to work updating the country's infrastructure, making public buildings more energy-efficient and implementing environmentally friendly technologies, including alternative energy sources. During his campaign, Obama said he would invest $150 billion over 10 years in clean energy. He proposed increasing fuel economy standards and requiring that 10 percent of electricity in the United States comes from renewable sources by 2012.","Physicist Steven Chu to be named as nominee next week .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- An audio message attributed to Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, the highest ranking former member of Saddam Hussein's regime still at large, salutes the ""People of Palestine"" and calls on them to fight back against Israel in Gaza. A 1999 file image of Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, who served under Saddam Hussien's regime and who is still at large. ""We say to the people of Gaza, give more resistance and we will be with you in the field, and know that our victory in kicking out the invaders is your victory as well, because the main assailant on the nation and on Palestine is the American imperialism,"" the recording said. ""A salute to the martyrs of the massacre, and our condolences to their families."" Al-Douri's recording follows reports of a similarly defiant message from al Qaeda's deputy chief a day earlier. Ayman al-Zawahiri reportedly vowed revenge for Israel's air and ground assault on Gaza and called Israel's actions against Hamas militants ""a gift"" from U.S. President-elect Barack Obama. Israel is in the 12th day of a military operation against Hamas militants, who have been firing rockets from Gaza into southern Israel. Al-Douri's 30-minute recorded message was broadcast Wednesday on al-Raei Iraqi satellite television over an old picture of al-Douri, wearing his Iraqi military uniform. CNN has not been able to independently verify the authenticity of the voice on the tape. This is not al-Douri's first purported audio message. There have been at least four others over the past three years in addition to a statement attributed to him. Al-Douri, 66, served as vice-chairman of Hussein's Revolutionary Command Council. He remains at large nearly six years after the war in Iraq began. He has previously been reported killed and captured, although those reports later turned out to be erroneous. He was the King of Clubs (No. 6) on the U.S. military's card deck of most wanted regime officials. The U.S. military says he has helped finance the insurgency against U.S. troops in Iraq with Iraqi funds he transferred to Syria before Hussein's government collapsed in April 2002. But it says his influence has waned while he has been in hiding. U.S. officials say al-Douri played key roles in the chemical attack on the Kurdish town of Halabja in 1988 and in putting down Kurdish and Shiite revolts after the 1991 Persian Gulf War.","Al-Douri was vice-chairman of Hussein's Revolutionary Command Council .

"(CNN) -- Decorating in the midst of a financial recession is not easy. But Thom Filicia, host of the Style Network's ""Dress My Nest,"" author of ""Thom Filicia Style"" and former cast member of ""Queer Eye for the Straight Guy,"" insists that it can be done. ""Paint is very affordable. Pick a color that has life and personality,"" Thom Filicia says. ""I always tell people, 'Start with what you have.' Work as much with what you have as possible, and then fill in where necessary,"" Filicia said. CNN recently asked the design guru about decorating on a budget and helpful tips to make your home look its best. CNN: When you walk into a room that you're going to redesign, where does your mind first go? Thom Filicia: I look at the layout, I look at the way the space is being used, and I try to figure out what the best use of the space is; that it works really well, it looks good, that you're getting the best views, you're seeing the space, and that you're getting through the space. CNN: And that's focusing mainly on furniture? Filicia: That really focuses on all the furniture. You want to look at where the rug is and where the sofa is and coffee tables and chairs -- just how the room works. Even if it's great-looking stuff, it sometimes doesn't look as good as it can look. CNN: What can people on a tight budget do to rearrange their living room and make it look better with what they have? Filicia: Make sure that your furniture layout works. Make sure that the things you love to look at, you're seeing. Make sure things aren't cluttered. Paint is very affordable. Pick a color that has life and personality. You could do an accent wall behind your sofa. You could use a low-[volatile organic compound] paint so it's environmentally friendly. You can use inexpensive up lights. You put them on either side of a piece of furniture or behind a tree. You always want to have a Lutron dimmer you plug into the wall. And then plug your lamps into the Lutron dimmer, and you can dim the whole room. CNN: As far as accessories go, like flowers and pillows, where do you draw the line on too much or not enough? Filicia: I like to keep things clean and straightforward. I think one floral arrangement is usually enough, or maybe a couple really small cute little ones. Pillows should function. You want to sit on a sofa and be comfortable. Start with three: one lumbar in the center and maybe a pair of pillows left and right. Add a throw, a rug for underfoot. Those things start to add layers to the room and make it a little more acoustical. CNN: What are some common designing rules that people always tend to follow but that you can actually break? Filicia: People think that dark walls make a room smaller. It actually makes the space bigger. All the corners recede, and it adds a lot of depth. Also, I think that color definitely adds a lot of warmth to spaces. CNN: What's the most common mistake that people make? Filicia: People just don't trust their instincts, and they're not willing to take a risk. Have fun with it. It's only decorating. People tend to go with beige and white just because they're afraid or they don't want to make a commitment. CNN: If someone had just enough money to do one thing in their room, what would you tell them to focus on? Filicia: The first thing you want to really focus on is a great sofa, because it is really the anchor for the room. In a bedroom, the anchor piece is your bed. Start with your anchor piece, and that's where you spend your most money. CNN: You have a new book out now, is that right? Filicia: Yup, I have a book out right now, which is called ""Thom Filicia Style,"" and it's a great book. It's a lot of fun. It's got a lot of great tips in it. It talks about my philosophy; it talks about color and texture. It's a very comprehensive book with case studies. CNN: Can you give us some tips for making a place eco-friendly on a tight budget? Filicia: It's very easy to use eco-friendly cleaning supplies, environmentally friendly lighting throughout your house using low wattage or eco-friendly bulbs. Also, just turning your lights off when you're not in a room; when you're brushing your teeth not keeping the water running; taking shorter showers. These are all really simple, easy ways that we can all help Mother Earth repair and heal and replenish itself.","Thom Filicia of ""Dress My Nest"" gives home decorating tips .

"(CNN) -- Comedian Mark Russell was at a recent event in Chicago, Illinois, when he found himself sitting next to Valerie Jarrett, an adviser to President-elect Barack Obama. Moving the Obamas into the White House will take about six hours. Russell asked her whether President Bush's staff members were going to remove all the Os from their computer keyboards, alluding to the 2001 incident in which President Clinton's departing staff removed Ws from some White House computers. Jarrett said no, but that didn't stop Russell from speculating what really happened when President Bush's daughters, Barbara and Jenna, gave Obama's two daughters a tour of the White House recently. ""The Bush daughters showed Sasha and Malia Obama around,"" Russell joked. ""Barbara showed them where all the bedrooms were, and Jenna showed them how to make a fake ID."" Russell sees humor in the presidential transition, but the actual operation to move both families in and out of the White House is serious business. The clearing out of the Bushes' belongings began over the summer, when many items were packed and taken to Crawford, Texas, says Anita McBride, chief of staff to first lady Laura Bush. Then, during the Christmas holiday, the Bushes moved their personal things out of Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, according to McBride. On January 20, the Obamas move in -- a side of Inauguration Day that most people never see: a grueling, precisely timed workday involving scores of staffers that follows six months of careful planning. Gary Walters worked at the executive mansion from 1986 until 2006 as chief usher in charge of moving presidential families in and out of the White House. From his Virginia home, Walters described how the complicated Obama move in to the White House is completed in only a few hours. In the morning, after the Bushes and Obamas depart the executive mansion for the Capitol Hill swearing-in ceremony, moving trucks will roll up to the south side of the White House, Walters said. The drivers put down their tailgates, allowing most of the White House's 93 staff members to begin unloading Obama family items, he said. ""Staff members all have been given very specific jobs on that day, almost down to the minute as to what their responsibilities are,"" Walters said. The move is designed to be seamless, painless and invisible while millions of Washington visitors -- and millions more watching on TV -- follow the inauguration ceremonies and the parade that follows. By about 5 p.m., before the Obamas move from the parade viewing stand to their new home, the presidential move must be complete. ""Their clothes will be in their closets; everything will be put away,"" Walters said. ""There should be no full or half-empty boxes will in view. Furniture will be set in proper places. Their favorite foods will be in the kitchen or the pantry. The chief usher will welcome them into their home and ask them what they would like to do before going out to enjoy the inaugural balls."" Incoming first lady Michelle Obama's mother, Marian Robinson, will also be moving into the White House residence, which has 24 rooms on the second and third floors. The Obamas have hired California decorator Michael Smith to use an allocated $100,000 to redecorate the space.  Watch what decorator may do with the White House » . ""I think they're going to find that this is really conducive to family life,"" President Bush told CNN's Larry King. ""President-elect Obama has got a 45-second commute to see his girls."" In the West Wing of the White House, the political jostling has begun among new staffers to grab workspaces near the center of power: the Oval Office. There, the carpet is changed with each new administration to suit the incoming president, Walters said. Possibly, the office desk will be changed, as will paintings that will be hung on the wall. Books on the Oval Office shelves will be changed per the new commander in chief, as will accessories to be placed around the room, Walters said. Staffers may tote in a new sofa and chairs -- or busts of past presidents. Following tradition, Bush is expected to leave a personal letter written to Obama. Past letters have offered the new president private words of advice and reflection. Several Democratic presidents have chosen to hang a Thomas Sully painting of President Andrew Jackson in the Oval Office, said political scientist and historian Martha Joynt Kumar, an expert on the White House. ""In the residence, many presidents have brought their personal paintings to decorate their living space."" After movers tote out boxes of office materials from Bush staffers, the West Wing will become a dusty workspace, with empty bookshelves and the odd three-ring binder left behind, say veterans of the White House press corps. As in previous moving periods, contractors may come to slap on a coat of paint or lay carpet as the new crop of staffers finds their workspaces. ""It was incredible,"" former Clinton staffer David Seldin said, recalling his experience on Inauguration Day 1993. ""I think people were overwhelmed with the sense that it was real and the sense that something that you had been working on as a political campaign is actually becoming part of the government."" On Tuesday, once the whirlwind moving operation is finally done, Chief Usher Stephen Rochon will probably greet Obama the same way Walters did Bush in 2001. Standing near the doorway to the White House North Portico, Walters recalls, he said, ""Hello, Mr. President, welcome to your home."" Oh, and about those Os on White House keyboards -- two Bush officials told CNN on Sunday that outgoing aides won't be getting payback on the incoming Democratic administration. There is an understanding that Bush will be furious if there are any pranks, especially after cordial transition between the two administrations, the officials said.","Ex-White House usher details whirlwind moving operation for Bush, Obama .

"BOCA RATON, Florida (CNN) -- Edgar and Nina Otto say they had no idea how their four-legged clone would react to them. But last week, after waiting several months, the yellow Labrador puppy bounded off an airplane at Miami International Airport, right into their arms. Lancelot Encore is his name, or Lancy for short. Nina and Edgar Otto say their cloned puppy crosses his paws like the original dog did. The puppy Lancy looks and acts just like Lancelot, their first Lab, who died a year ago, say the Ottos. That's not surprising, because Lancy is Lancelot's clone. ""We just got him because we wanted to have Lancelot more than just the 11½ years,"" Nina Otto said. The Ottos submitted the winning bid of $155,000 at an auction with a San Francisco biotech company that had Lancelot cloned in South Korea.  Watch Lancy at home with the Ottos » . ""Did I ever think that I was going to spend $150K on a dog? No,"" Edgar Otto said, adding, ""This is a really sweet dog, and ... we're very happy that we did it."" Edgar Otto is the son of Edward Otto, a co-founder of NASCAR. So money was really not an issue for this family. They got the idea five years ago and had a sample of Lancelot's DNA extracted and banked when they heard that cloning was possible. So far, the Ottos say Lancy is eerily similar to Lancelot. They say Lancy walks just like Lancelot and crosses his paws like him, too. ""I only was hoping to get the essence of Lancelot back,"" Nina said. ""I know I've gotten that. Anything else is icing on the cake."" But is it the same dog? ""It's as close as you can get,"" Edgar said. The Ottos have nine other dogs, as well as cats, birds and sheep, all living on a spectacular 12-acre spread in Boca Raton, Florida. ""This dog was immediately accepted by the nine dogs,"" Edgar Otto said. ""There was no baring of teeth, not ever a single growl. So, the pack accepted him."" Four customers who also placed winning bids in an auction by BioArts International will have their dogs cloned, and those pets will be delivered in the coming months. BioArts is collaborating with South Korea's Sooam Biotech Research Foundation to produce the dog clones. Cloning dogs is considered difficult because of their complicated reproductive physiology, but the procedure has been perfected in South Korea, according to industry experts. In Lancy's case, his DNA was placed inside an egg from a South Korean dog and implanted in an Irish setter in South Korea. About two months later, 1.3-pound Lancy was born in a single litter birth. BioArts says it's an expensive process and the company is still analyzing whether pet cloning can be a viable, profitable business. ""I would love to see more families be able to have this experience,"" said Lou Hawthorne, the BioArts CEO. ""But due to the complexity and cost of the process, availability is going to be limited for the foreseeable future,"" he said. Lancy is a robust 17-pounder today, and quite healthy according to the Ottos. He romps around their yard like any puppy would. But, the Ottos say, he's taken a particular fondness to a bush planted at the spot where his original, Lancelot, died last year. ""This is the only guy that's gone to that bush, and he started burrowing in the bush,"" Edgar Otto said. ""I don't know what to make of that, but we have nine dogs and let them play everyday out here, and this guy just hung out there,"" he said. But this story is not without its critics. The Ottos can do whatever they want with their money, but ""a shelter dog just lost out on a great chance of having a home,"" said Cherie Wachter of the Humane Society of Broward County, Florida. Each year, the Humane Society euthanizes 3 million to 4 million pets in the United States. ""I think, until the day comes when animal shelters across this country have empty cages all the time ... maybe then think about cloning,"" Wachter said. But the Ottos have a whole zoo full of pets and have donated more than $300,000 to their local Humane Society. ""The only reason I don't go to the Humane Society is because I would bring every one of them home,"" Nina Otto said. But this process appears to open up a whole new horizon for pet lovers with money in the bank. Edgar Otto says he's a futurist. ""Think about this,"" he said philosophically. ""You could have your favorite dog with you your entire life. I don't think that's too far-fetched.""","Edgar and Nina Otto paid $150,000 to clone their late dog using stored DNA .

"(CNN) -- When it comes to the sport of wrestling, longtime adversaries Iran and the United States are friendly enemies. Andy Hrovat, right, seen wrestling Reineris Salas of Cuba, is among the U.S. wrestlers touring this winter. A U.S. freestyle men's wrestling team will go to the Islamic republic -- where the sport is widely popular -- for a prestigious tournament in March. Nine American wrestlers will take part in the Takhti Cup competition, scheduled for March 12-13, according to state Iranian media and USA Wrestling -- the national governing body for Olympics wrestling in the United States. ""In Iran, wrestling and soccer are the two major sports,"" said Gary Abbott, director of communications for USA Wrestling in Colorado Springs, Colorado. ""They know their wrestling as well as anyone in the world. They treat our athletes like kings."" Relations between the United States and Iran ended after Iranian militants seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and held Americans hostage there for 444 days. More recently, the two countries have been at odds over Iran's nuclear ambitions and have been sharply critical of each other's policies and actions in the Middle East. But Abbott said there has been a history of U.S. and Iranian wrestling exchanges despite the politics. Both sides are always looking for opportunities to compete. Abbott said Iran is one of the top wrestling powers in the world, along with countries such as the United States, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine. Competing in a wrestling-crazy society like Iran is special to Americans, who look forward to getting on the mats before large crowds in sold-out arenas. ""For the common citizen, an American wrestler in Iran is like Michael Jordan going over there,"" Abbott said, referring to the world-famous American basketball legend. USA Wrestling said the trip is one of several overseas events this winter for American wrestlers. U.S. teams also will also be competing in Russia, Ukraine, Sweden, Cuba, Bulgaria, Belarus, Turkey, Serbia, Hungary and Slovenia. The team going to Iran includes four men who have represented the United States in the Olympics.","Longtime adversaries Iran and the United States are friendly enemies on the mat .

"LAGOS, Nigeria -- Incident details: ""Armed pirates chased, boarded and hijacked a fishing trawler underway"" southeast of Mogadishu, Somalia. ""Several persons armed with machine guns, rocket-propelled grenade launchers and machetes attempting to climb onboard with use of rope"" at Lagos anchorage, Nigeria. The Yemeni coast guard patrols the Gulf of Aden in March. Reading the International Maritime Bureau's Live Piracy Report a catalog of piracy reports from around the world, two names crop up with disturbing frequency: Somalia and Nigeria. The list reads like a history book telling tales of the buccaneers of old -- daring raids, kidnappings and ransoms. But these days, Africa's pirates are using automatic weapons and grenades. Thousands of miles apart, Somalia's and Nigeria's pirates have no communication, and their circumstances are very different. Somalia is a barren, dusty failed state, and Somali pirates operate in the vast Gulf of Aden. Pirates in Nigeria operate from the sprawling metropolis of Lagos harbor to the riverine creeks of the Niger Delta region. But they're after the same thing: money.  Watch how negotiations with pirates take place » . And to get it they seem to be feeding off each other's ideas. ""One of the interesting things about piracy offshore West Africa is that it has started to mimic piracy trends off the Horn of Africa, places like Somalia,"" explained Rolake Akinola, West Africa analyst at Control Risks. ""Some of the tactics used are increasingly sophisticated. Sophisticated weaponry is used by some of those pirate groups, and it's becoming much more violent."" The tactics employed often involve small speedboats pulling up alongside their target, boarding and, often resorting to violence, kidnapping the crew or cargo.  Watch a shipping company chief describe being hijacked » . Ransoms can run into the millions of dollars. In Somalia last year, the hijacked Saudi oil tanker Sirius Star was released after a $3 million ransom was dropped by helicopter to the pirates. Local governments in Nigeria's Niger Delta often keep a special fund to pay kidnappers. Hundreds have been kidnapped in the past few years, with American and British hostages in particular considered ""high-value."" In countries where the majority of the population lives on less than $2 a day, the ransoms are considerable amounts of money. And the money is often splashed out on flashy Humvees, flat-screen TVs and more weapons. Visiting pirates in the swamps of the Niger Delta, we were taken to the commander's new home. Surrounded by mud huts in the mangroves, a generator powered a refrigerator filled with bottles of champagne that the men drank as they played on their imported pool table. They were all young men who complained about the lack of job opportunities and were enticed into piracy by promised riches on show at the commander's house. Off Somalia's coast, a NATO-led task force is trying to crack down on Somali pirates. And the U.S. Navy is making frequent visits to West Africa to train local navies to combat pirates. ""The task force are doing a fantastic job, and they are very much welcome,"" said Michael Howlett, divisional director of the International Maritime Bureau. He pointed out that in February, for every eight attacks, there was only one hijacking. But the bureau also says 2009 has seen a spike in pirate attacks, particularly off the east coast of Somalia. More than 15 attacks were reported by March. With their attacks, pirates are challenging not just international shipping lanes but Africa's rule of law. The pirates are now operating hundreds of miles from their bases. Somali pirates operate freely along the coastlines of Kenya and Tanzania, with the potential to threaten tourists on the beaches. In March, Somalis hijacked a yacht and its crew of seven off the Seychelles. Earlier this year, unknown Nigerian gunmen attacked the presidential palace in Equatorial Guinea. They were eventually chased away by a military helicopter. To combat the problem, analysts like Akinola are agreed: More is needed than military force. ""Governments need to look at some of the social and underlying economic issues that allow piracy, so issues around governance and the provision of social services to populations in many of the countries affected.""","Risk experts say pirates in East and West Africa are after the same thing .

"ARLINGTON, Virginia (CNN) -- The honors were late but still well-received Wednesday for members of the first all-African-American, all-female unit to serve overseas in World War II. Mary Crawford Ragland said when they came home from service, there were no parades for them. During the war, nearly 1,000 women from the ""Six-Triple Eight"" Central Postal Battalion moved mountains  of mail for millions of American service members and civilians that clogged warehouses in England and France. Their service to their country had been overlooked for years, starting with when they returned to the United States from assignments overseas. ""There was no parade,"" said Mary Crawford Ragland. ""We just came home."" The 82-year old was among those gathered Wednesday at the Women's Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery, where a U.S. Army support group called the Freedom Team Salute presented them with certificates of appreciation, timed with Black History Month.  Watch women receive their honors » . The group also gives a letter of appreciation signed by the Army Chief of Staff and the Secretary of the Army, an Army lapel pin and an Army decal. For Alyce Dixon, 101, it was worth the wait. ""They asked me because I'm one of the oldest survivors, and I can still talk,"" she said with a smile. Nearly 800 women that were part of the 6888th were first stationed in Birmingham, England, for three months, moved to Rouen, France, and finally settled in Paris, according to the Army's Web site. They were responsible for redirecting mail to more than seven million people -- all U.S. armed forces in the European Theater of Operations, including Army, Navy, Marine Corps, civilians and Red Cross workers. As Army units quickly moved throughout Western Europe and into Germany, a massive mail snag occurred because of a manpower shortage. Soldiers continued to move, fighting battles across the continent, but weren't getting their mail. Morale began to drop. That's when the Army turned to the ""Six-Triple-Eight"" When Dixon and the other women arrived at a warehouse in early 1945, they found the building had no heat. Inside the warehouse, the windows were painted black to keep the light from coming out at night against bombing raids. Because there was no heat, the women donned long johns and anything else they could layer on. But the temperature was nothing compared with the daunting challenge of sorting the mail. When they walked inside the warehouse, it was stacked to the ceiling with undelivered packages and letters. ""They had 90 billion pieces of mail,"" Dixon told CNN, some of it from hometown friends and family addressed only to ""Junior, U.S. Army or Buster, U.S. Army,"" she said. ""We had to figure it out,"" she said. Even when there were complete names, it wasn't easy. There were 7,500 soldiers named Robert Smith in the European Theater of Operations, according to the Museum of Black WWII History Web site, and the women had to keep them straight. Because all undeliverable mail passed through them, they were charged with keeping information cards on everyone in the European Theater of Operations, according to the Army site. Because frontline soldiers were often moved frequently, the women often had to update information several times a month. While it was an arduous task, the women knew the importance of their job. For soldiers in the field, letters from loved ones brought important personal connections that kept their morale going. So they kept on sorting. Eight hours at a time, three shifts per day, seven days a week, they kept on sorting. And because of them, 65,000 letters went out each shift to soldiers across Europe. On Wednesday, the favor was finally returned.","Women were enlisted to help with backlog of mail that was decreasing morale .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President Obama affirmed his support for a woman's ""right to choose"" on Thursday, the 36th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision that led to the legalization of abortion, as thousands of anti-abortion activists descended on the National Mall to challenge his position. President Obama issued a statement defending Roe v. Wade for protecting ""women's health and reproductive freedom."" Roe v. Wade ""not only protects women's health and reproductive freedom, but stands for a broader principle: that government should not intrude on our most private family matters,"" Obama said in a statement. The landmark 1973 decision held that a woman's right to abortion was protected by the right to privacy under the Constitution's 14th Amendment, voiding most state laws against abortion at the time. Nellie Gray, who helped organize the anti-abortion March for Life on the Mall, invited Obama to speak at the rally. ""America needs your strong leadership as president of all the people to stop the intentional killing of an estimated 3,000 pre-born boys and girls each day and the brutalizing of mind, heart and body of pregnant mothers."" Kim Gandy, president of the National Organization for Women, said she believes that while abortion should remain an option, increasing the availability and affordability of birth control and reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies is the real solution. ""I think what everyone ought to be interested in doing, whether they are or not, is reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies,"" Gandy told CNN. ""Because if we reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies, it will by definition reduce the number of abortions and reduce a lot of the pain and despair that has befallen women in these economic times, who cannot afford to enlarge their families when they don't have a job and they don't have a way to put food on the table for the kids that they have now. ""If we could all work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies, it would dramatically change the debate on this issue."" Obama has so far not struck down rules reinstated by the Bush administration eight years ago, prohibiting U.S. money from funding international family planning groups that promote abortion or provide information, counseling or referrals about abortion services. The ""Mexico City policy"" was initially put in place by President Ronald Reagan and suspended during Bill Clinton's presidency. Its opponents refer to it as the ""global gag order."" About 20 anti-abortion rights lawmakers spoke at the rally Thursday, pushing for a renewed effort to overturn Roe v. Wade. ""At what instant does life begin?"" asked Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, focusing on younger crowd members who answered, ""Conception!"" ""And the next question is, "" he continued, ""President Obama, when did your life begin?"" Other legislators detailed their plans to keep the issue on the table in Congress and on the minds of voters. Rep. Jean Schmidt, R-Ohio, told the crowd she plans to introduce what she calls the ""Juno Bill,"" referencing the hit 2008 film of the same title in which a high school teenager gives her baby up for adoption. ""It will provide a tax credit to those women, just as we allow abortions to be tax deductible, it will provide a tax credit so that they can carry out their pregnancy, give that baby to a loving arm and not have to worry about the consequences or the costs involved,"" she said. Throughout the rally, speakers urged bold action for their cause. Gandy said the fight will also continue on the pro-abortion rights side. ""There's no question we have a pro-choice president now, but he can't do it alone,"" she said. ""He can't pass legislation. He can't stop what's going on at the state and local level and so the battle rages on ... at the congressional level, at the state and local level and certainly at the Supreme Court."" She said the number of unwanted pregnancies is rising, as congressional action has increased the cost of contraception for college students and low-income women, ""something we hope this administration will reverse."" Two pieces of federal legislation are pending, she said. The first will expand accessibility and availability of birth control, and the second, the Freedom of Choice Act, is a codification of Roe v. Wade. NOW will continue pursuing both at the congressional level, she said, but noted that even though Congress has a Democratic majority, it does not have a pro-abortion rights majority. ""So that will continue to be an uphill battle,"" she said .

"MOGADISHU, Somalia (CNN) -- At least 39 civilians were killed in Somalia's capital Monday after a convoy of African Union peacekeepers was hit by a roadside bomb, causing the troops to open fire, officials and eyewitnesses said. Islamist militia display weapons Monday in defiance of newly elected President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed. Maj. Ba-Huko Barigye, spokesman to the African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISON), said an explosion targeted a contingent of Ugandan troops. At least one soldier was injured and one of the vehicles damaged, Barigye said. Ahmed Dirie Ali, spokesman of Hawiye Traditional Elders -- a major group of local clan leaders -- condemned the civilian deaths. And Mogadishu's deputy mayor, Abdifatah Ibrahim Shaweye, accused AMISOM of killing innocent civilians deliberately during a ""brutal attack,"" an allegation Barigye denied. ""The deputy mayor has got the wrong information,"" he said. ""They are targeting AMISOM, but the people who have died are all Somali civilians, who have nothing, whatsoever to do with AMISOM."" Officials say the incident happened on Maka al-Mukarama road, which connects the presidential palace and the airport in southern Mogadishu. The incident occurred on the same day that the new Somali president, Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed, was attending an African Union summit in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa. Ethiopia invaded Somalia in 2006, to depose an Islamic government led by Ahmed that had taken control of Mogadishu. But at the summit, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged continued support for national reconciliation efforts in Somalia, which has been without an effective central government since 1991. ""It is important that these efforts should have a tangible effect in improving the security environment for the Somali people and humanitarian actors,"" Ban said in a statement released by his office. ""The United Nations will provide strong logistical support to the African Union's AMISOM force and help develop Somali security forces."" He also encouraged AU leaders to consider a plan that will incorporate AMISOM into a larger U.N. peacekeeping force in the months ahead. AMISOM was set up to take over from Ethiopian forces, which were supposed to be withdrawn soon after the December 2006 invasion that deposed the Islamic Courts Union, which Ahmed once led. But the Ethiopians and the country's U.N.-backed transitional government were soon battling Islamist guerrillas, including the militia al-Shabaab -- which the United States has designated as a terrorist group with links to al Qaeda. The transitional government eventually signed a peace agreement with a new movement led by Ahmed, the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia. But al-Shabaab has rejected the deal and continued fighting. The militia overran the town of Baidoa, the seat of the transitional government, within hours of the withdrawal of Ethiopian troops last week. Ahmed was elected president Saturday by lawmakers in Djibouti, and many Somalis view him as a final hope to challenge the militia and its extremist ideology. CNN's Amir Ahmed and Ahmednor Mohamed Farah for CNN contributed to this report.","Roadside bomb strikes African Union peacekeepers, AU mission says .

"Editor's note: CNN has asked its journalists across the country to offer their thoughts on how the economic crisis is affecting their cities. In this installment, All Platform Journalist John Couwels reports from Orlando, Florida. Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, has announced that it will lay off employees. ORLANDO, Florida (CNN) -- Orlando: What first comes to mind? Walt Disney World or Universal resorts, perhaps? The two parks are the nation's biggest tourist draws. As a new resident of Orlando, I find that the tourist areas are more removed from the city than I thought. Still, some people in the area where I currently live either work or have business dealings at tourist attractions. As with every city in the United States, Orlando is dealing with the fallout of an economic slowdown. Tourism officials expect an 8 percent to 10 percent drop in tourism dollars for 2009. Nonetheless, during a recent visit to Disney's Magic Kingdom with my family, I experienced a packed park. My first visit in 10 years: The park did not seem any different except for the $129 I paid for a six-month Florida resident pass. Disney World recently announced a major loss in income and that layoffs are expected. Sources within Disney say the layoffs could begin this week. Disney will not say how many people will be eliminated while it restructures and consolidates operations. I have not heard panic among businesses and city officials over the Disney announcement, despite the fact Disney World says it is the biggest single-site employer in the United States with 62,000. Disney spokesman Mike Griffin said: ""We are bigger than the Pentagon."" Disney told me cuts would be significant, affecting back office workers. Griffin said guests visiting the parks would not see any difference. Danielle Courtney, spokeswoman of the Orange County Convention and Visitors Bureau, said she was sure that ""Disney will provide a value experience for their guests."" But she said Disney is doing what every other business is doing: cutting costs. Orlando's economic and development director, Bill Billingsley, said the city has not lost a significant amount of jobs. Billingsley is concerned about the Disney layoffs but optimistic on the limited effect on the city's economic health. From the big corporations to the funky little tea and sandwich shop east of downtown, businesses are feeling the pinch. The owner of Pom Pom's Teahouse and Sandwicheria was telling my friend how she had to cut everyone's hours to part time to save on expenses. The store has been open since 2006. Owner Pom Moongauklang, a trained pastry chef, told me she's doing whatever it takes to stay open. Pom cut her four employees' hours instead of their jobs, lowered prices and extended hours to 24 hours on the weekends. Pom said of the 60- to 70-hour work week: ""It's killing me, but it's working."" Along the epicenter of tourist hotels, restaurants and T-shirt shops, International Drive business owners say they are hurting. Aby Aly, owner of a gift shop selling goods from T-shirts to plush dolls, said that ""business is off by 35 percent, and people are not buying."" As I drive around town, I do not see a large number of closed-down stores. Like other cities, Orlando has seen big national chain closures like Linen-N-Things and Circuit City. Yet at two of the area's outlet malls, you would never know there is an economic crisis. I waited 10 minutes in line to enter the parking lot. In the suburbs where foreclosures are their highest, more businesses have closed their doors. As I looked for a house to rent I was surprised how a one-bedroom condo in downtown was the same price as a four-bedroom house only five miles away. Real estate agent Sue Bee Laginess said the city has a glut of homes and condominiums for sale or rent. She said her office has seen business double from four months ago because of the low prices. The agent said owners have either lowered prices, been foreclosed on or are selling the house for the amount owed to the bank. For one store in my new quaint neighborhood of College Park, business has never been better: Top Drawer Consignments. Fred Rodgers, a former Disney designer and one of the store's owners, said ""the tough economy is helping us."" Shoppers say they save money buying used furniture. Yet College Park has not been immune from the economic crisis; real estate offices and gift shops have closed there, too. Despite the downturn, Orlando officials believe their city has fared better than most. Orlando's economic development director told me Orlando is building a medical city that will add 10,000 jobs in the coming years. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer will give his State of Orlando speech Wednesday, the same week the area's biggest employer could begin layoffs.","Resort mecca Orlando, Florida, feels the pinch of economic slowdown .

"(CNN) -- The news this week might have made Corky Ra roll over in his mummiform, his specially commissioned $40,000 bronze final resting place. Ron Temu, a licensed funeral director, is in charge of mummification practices for Summum. The founder of Summum, a small Utah-based spiritual group, died in January 2008 at age 63. That was after his community -- one that practices meditations and a modern form of mummification, makes its own sacramental wine and considers itself less of a religion than a way of life -- began to make national headlines with its journey to the Supreme Court. It began with a push to erect a monument listing Summum's seven guiding principles in a Utah municipal park that has long displayed a monument listing the Ten Commandments. The U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, Colorado, ruled in 2007 that free speech guarantees Summum the right to erect a monument. But the Supreme Court unanimously agreed Wednesday with the city of Pleasant Grove, Utah, which argued that displays on public property, privately donated or otherwise, amount to ""government speech"" and fall under the discretion of local officials. Beyond the headlines about what the ruling means to parks, 9/11 memorials and other monuments is an obscure group that wants recognition that its Seven Aphorisms are as valid as the Ten Commandments. The aphorisms are the principles of psychokinesis, correspondence, vibration, opposition, rhythm, cause and effect, and gender. ""A lot of people are so tired of being told how they have to worship,"" said Su Menu, 58, who has subscribed to Summum's teachings for more than 30 years. ""It's not about dogma; it's about becoming the best you can be. Whatever path you discover that leads you in that direction, that's where you need to be."" The group was founded in 1975 after Claude ""Corky"" Rex Nowell, who was raised in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, said he had encounters with ""advanced beings,"" which he chronicled in his book, ""Summum: Sealed Except to the Open Mind."" Nowell legally changed his name to Summum Bonum Amon Ra, but still used the first name Corky. To those who follow his teachings, the idea that Ra would be visited by some kind of higher power was no more far-fetched than any other religious leader's claims. Menu's legal name is Summum Bonum Neffer Menu, although the piano teacher professionally still goes by Sue Parsons. What Ra gave to her was a better sense of, and appreciation for, herself, she said. She grew up in the Midwest, in what she described as a very conservative Christian environment. ""For a long time, I felt like a terrible person because I couldn't worship and feel exactly like my parents,"" she said Thursday. Summum is ""about an ongoing progression of the soul and discovery of that, of what's in you. ... It made me feel like I'm OK, and I've become a stronger person because of it. I don't see how anybody can come to the conclusion that that's bad."" Summum practitioners ""believe in one source,"" Menu said, ""but we just don't label it as God. We just call it creation. We call it Summum,"" which is a Latin term meaning ""the sum total of all creation."" The community meets in a small copper-colored pyramid off Interstate 15 in Salt Lake City, and includes people of various religious backgrounds. Tapping into Summum's teachings does not require anyone to give up ties to other faith traditions. The various religious texts -- including a copy of the Quran, the Hebrew Bible and The Book of Mormon -- found in the pyramid, as well as the multitude of Buddhas, are a testament to Summum's inclusion of any and all spiritual philosophies. Also in the pyramid is a menagerie of mummified animals. Some cats, including Vincent, Oscar and Smokey, stand in row, across the room from Dobermans named Butch and Wendy, as well as Menu's beloved poodle, Maggie, who was mummified at a cost of about $12,000. The process devised by Summum preserves the body by soaking it in mummification fluids for at least 77 days before, among other things, slathering it with lanolin, wrapping it in gauze, painting it with multiple layers of butyl rubber and eventually sealing it in a mummiform. The process can take about six months to complete, and it is during this time that the soul of the living is guided into its next lifetime. About 1,500 people from across the globe, and from many different religions, have requested these mummification arrangements through their local funeral homes, said Ron Temu, a licensed funeral director and longtime Summum practitioner. But so far only one, the Summum founder, has actually been mummified. An artist was commissioned to create Ra's mummiform, the face of which looks just like his. Though he's already sealed inside it, it is not yet on display in the pyramid. ""We're still working on the gold leaf,"" Temu said Thursday. ""Once that's done, we'll have him in there."" Summum does not require attendance or membership, so there is no way to know the number of adherents. Menu estimated that ""hundreds of thousands"" of people across the globe have studied Summum's teachings, which are broadcast online, ""but once they learn the meditations, they're free to go live their own lives."" The meditations, of which there are many, are less about what is said than the way they make people feel, which is a good thing, because some are in a language unknown to Menu and other practitioners. There are those that are said in English, too, and then there is the Meditation of Sexual Ecstasy, which is less about words and more about actions between lovers. ""We're one humanity, but we all have our path and we all have our own experiences,"" Menu said. ""We're just learning lessons this lifetime around.""","Summum takes monument fight to Supreme Court and loses .

"(CNN) -- Scientists expect some great travel spots to be altered or ruined by global climate change. Glaciers in the European Alps may melt as soon as 2050, some scientists say. Some of the changes are already taking place. Others are expected to be seen in coming decades. There are two ways to look at this: Either stay home (which might be less depressing and won't add more airline emissions) or get a move on it and see the hot spots you just can't miss. For those who want to head out, CNN got advice on the best pre-warming travel destinations from Bob Henson, author of ""The Rough Guide to Climate Change"" and a writer at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. Here are Henson's top five choices: . Great Barrier Reef, Australia . Warming temperatures can spell disaster for coral reefs, which depend on a delicate balance of ocean temperature and chemistry to bloom into colorful displays. Many of the world's reefs already are experiencing ""bleaching"" in which algae living in the coral die and leave behind whitened skeletons. The Great Barrier Reef -- which is composed of about 2,900 individual reefs and is off the northeast coast of Australia -- is seeing limited bleaching now, and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority expects the problem to grow in coming decades. Henson said the reefs' colorful displays are not to be missed. ""It's a feast for the eyes in terms of color, texture variations -- it's just amazing to see,"" he said. ""It's wonderful to be enveloped in the warm water and look down just a few feet below at this amazing spread of ocean life."" Boats of people with snorkels typically launch into the reefs from Cairns, Queensland. If you go, tread lightly, Henson said. Visitors can damage the reefs if they get too close. New Orleans, Louisiana . How much sea levels will rise as the world warms is one of the trickiest parts of the climate change equation. If huge hunks of ice -- such as parts of Greenland and the western shelf of Antarctica -- melt, then the rise is expected to be more dramatic. ""Nobody knows whether they're going to completely melt or not, but we do know it's not going to happen in the next 10 years,"" Henson said. But for cities near the coast such as New Orleans, which already sits below sea level, rising waters could spell trouble for tourists and residents alike, even in the relative near term. ""In the next several hundred years, life there may be difficult, and the cities may become impractical unless we can build large structures to keep the waters at bay,"" he said. Henson doesn't expect New Orleans to be underwater anytime soon. But travel to the Louisiana city may become more difficult in the future, he said. Scientists expect floods to become more frequent. ""It's sobering to be in New Orleans and look up at the levees that sit above you and keep out the Mississippi River,"" he said. ""You're standing below the level of the river, looking up."" Rocky Mountain National Park, Estes Park, Colorado . Herds of tiny pine beetles are munching away at Colorado's forests, turning the evergreens a sickly red and destroying large patches of trees. Cold snaps -- which, in mountain terms, mean about five nights of minus-30 temperatures -- usually kill off the native beetles. But winters are warming, and Henson and others said they worry the beetles can't be stopped. The beetle infestation ""has reached epidemic proportions as a result of climate issues,"" said Kyle Patterson, spokeswoman for the Rocky Mountain National Park. The beetles are causing problems all over America's mountainous west, but the issue is particularly visible at Patterson's park, northwest of Denver. Henson recommends visiting the park this decade to ensure you can still see the dense forests in decent shape. Some of the reddened forests look beautiful in a strange way, Henson said, but visitors should note that the color isn't natural for pine trees. ""Come soon. It's happening quickly,"" he said. Visit in the summer or early fall and take a breathtaking drive to 12,183 feet, Patterson said. Or, come in the winter and enjoy snowshoeing and nearby skiing. Many of the park's 355 miles of hiking trails are open year-round. Alpine Glaciers, Switzerland . The European Alps sit at a lower altitude than the Rocky Mountains, and their glaciers and ski resorts are therefore more susceptible to melting, Henson said. A climate expert in Austria recently told National Geographic that the Alps' famed glaciers will disappear entirely between 2030 and 2050. A 2006 report had said they would melt by the end of the century. Henson said he once took a train through the Alpine glaciers. They're worth seeing before they go -- whenever that happens, he said. ""They're beautiful; the light blue quality of the meltwater is really stunning,"" he said. Amazon rain forest, Brazil . Deforestation continues to be the major environmental issue in the Amazon, the world's largest tropical rain forest. But as locals and corporations chop down the Amazon's rich forests to create farmland and to harvest biofuels, climate change may make things worse. ""The fear is that there will be kind of a feedback where trees are cut down, and it gets warmer and drier"" in the forest until it can't grow back, Henson said. The best way to visit the forest is by boat, Henson said. That way, you'll leave less of a mark on the struggling ecosystem. Of course, getting to a boat on the Amazon is not simple, and the long trip can create a lot of heat-trapping pollution. Henson said the destination might be one of those better left alone by tourists.","Global warming may ruin many of nature's wonders .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Some of the security officials at this weekend's Super Bowl will be scrutinizing the body language and demeanor of fans as part of the effort to spot suspicious and possibly dangerous people in the crowd. Fans take in the sights Thursday at the NFL Experience at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida. The Transportation Security Administration says it will have several teams of behavior-detection officers working with local police in Tampa, Florida, as an added security measure for the high-profile game. TSA spokesman Christopher White said that the officers are being sent at the request of the local police and the FBI, and that it's the first time such officers are assisting with a major sports event. ""Unlike technology, the human detection officers can be anywhere,"" White said. ""They can be completely unobtrusive."" The TSA officers will be wearing their uniforms and working in teams with police along the stadium's security perimeter but won't work inside the stadium as fans watch the game. They'll also be around key hotels associated with the Super Bowl, the airport and other transportation centers in Tampa.  Watch what goes on at Super Bowl media day » . According to White, if a TSA officer observes someone displaying unusual behavior, a local police officer will follow up by questioning the person. This month, the TSA also held a four-hour training session on behavior detection for about 100 Tampa-area police. The TSA officers themselves undergo an initial seven days of training before being paired with experienced officers and having follow-up training. Barry Steinhardt of the American Civil Liberties Union said such behavior screening is a bad idea. ""There is no scientific evidence behavior profiling works to pick out terrorists or criminals,"" Steinhardt said. The TSA uses behavior screening daily at airports. White said officers also have helped out at such high-profile events as last week's presidential inauguration and the Republican and Democratic national conventions.","TSA will scan body language and demeanor of fans attending big game .

"(CNN) -- The congressional showdown over Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius' nomination to President Obama's Cabinet may focus less on her qualifications than on the issue of abortion, analysts said. Then-presidential candidate Barack Obama listens to Gov. Kathleen Sebelius during a January 2008 rally. Obama  on Monday nominated Sebelius to head the Department of Health and Human Services. Cabinet nominations require Senate confirmation, and anti-abortion groups already are making their views known. Analysts suspected that Obama would face a battle over abortion if and when he makes a nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court, but religious conservatives could use Sebelius as a warm-up for the seemingly inevitable fight. Calling Sebelius an ""enemy of the unborn,"" Catholic League President Bill Donohue said the Kansas governor's nomination is particularly disturbing because the health and human services secretary is one of the few members of the administration who can directly affect abortion policy. ""Sebelius' support for abortion is so far off the charts that she has been publicly criticized by the last three archbishops of Kansas City,"" Donohue said in a statement.  Watch why filling the Cabinet post is urgent task » . The liberal group Catholics United has come to Sebelius' defense, saying the Kansas governor has taken several steps to lower the abortion rate in her state. The group also has posted excerpts of a 2006 speech in which Sebelius said she opposed abortion. ""My Catholic faith teaches me that all life is sacred, and personally I believe abortion is wrong,"" she said then. ""However, I disagree with the suggestion that criminalizing women and their doctors is an effective means of achieving the goal of reducing the number of abortions in our nation."" In May, Archbishop Joseph F. Naumann of Kansas City, Kansas, said that Sebelius' stance on abortion had ""grave spiritual and moral consequences."" He asked that Sebelius no longer receive Communion until she repudiated her stance and made a ""worthy sacramental confession."" Naumann was reacting to Sebelius' veto of state Senate Bill 389 and the subsequent House version, titled the Comprehensive Abortion Reform Act, either of which would have tightened abortion regulations in Kansas. In shooting down SB 389 in April, Sebelius wrote that the bill was problematic because it included no exceptions for pregnancies that endanger a woman's life and it allowed for individuals to seek court orders preventing a woman from obtaining an abortion, even if the procedure was necessary to save her life. ""I am concerned that the bill is likely unconstitutional, or even worse, endangers the lives of women,"" Sebelius said in a statement. She further said that Kansas had striven to lower its abortion rates through adoption incentives, extended health services for pregnant women, sex education and support services for families. Another lightning rod for Sebelius is attendance by Dr. George Tiller and his staff at a 2007 reception she held at the governor's mansion in Topeka. The doctor, who specializes in late-term abortions and once received the National Abortion Federation's highest honor, won the reception at a charity auction held for the Greater Kansas City Women's Political Caucus, according to the Topeka Capital-Journal. Tiller is presently facing charges relating to his practice. Last month, a district judge denied a motion to dismiss the case, meaning Tiller will go to trial on 19 misdemeanor counts relating to how he procured second opinions for late-term abortions, according to The Wichita Eagle. Though Sebelius is dogged by many on the religious right, GOP Sens. Sam Brownback and Pat Roberts of Kansas seem willing to give her a pass on her stance on abortion. Brownback, who sought the GOP presidential nomination and is one of the leading anti-abortion voices in the Senate, recently released a statement with Roberts, congratulating Sebelius and expressing an eagerness to work with their fellow Kansan on health issues. The senators said they expect to have several differences of opinion with the Obama administration -- especially on health care funding and nationalized health care -- but they make no mention of the abortion issue. David Brody, who covers the White House for the Christian Broadcasting Network, said the omission could pose a problem for anti-abortion advocates hoping to down Sebelius' nomination. ""It's a problem, and Sam Brownback has been in long step with them on the abortion issue. That's a setback for them,"" he said. Meanwhile, progressive groups have lent their outright support to Sebelius. Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a health care advocacy group, said Sebelius ""represents the knowledge, background, caring that I think is necessary for that position."" Sebelius, 60, is the daughter of former Ohio Gov. John Gilligan, who led that state from 1971-1975. The two-term governor has been credited for her bipartisanship and her success as a Democrat politician in a longtime red state. Her work with insurance companies -- both as an insurance executive and as Kansas' insurance commissioner -- will also lend itself to the work of the Cabinet post, her supporters said. However, those who are predicting a tussle over her Cabinet nomination concede that her experience will not be the bone of contention when she goes before the Senate. ""The pro-life groups have an itchy trigger finger on this. The inbox was full before Sebelius was nominated. They're ready for a fight,"" Brody told CNN. In a column last week, Brody wrote that Democrats have solid numbers in the Senate, and Sebelius could sail through confirmation hearings because some GOP moderates, such as Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, both of Maine, are supporters of abortion rights. Brody added that Sebelius is so qualified, the abortion issue may not be enough to derail her nomination. The abortion fight, however, may be one that Obama's team wants to avoid, he said Monday. ""Do they want to be sucked in, if you will, to a fight over abortion? Or do they want to leave that for a summer battle over a Supreme Court nominee potentially?"" Brody asked. ""That's the danger here for the Obama administration, to be a distraction.""","Catholic League president refers to Gov. Kathleen Sebelius as ""enemy of the unborn""

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Suspected Taliban militants blew up a bridge early Tuesday in the border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan, suspending NATO supply lines. A Pakistani policeman sits near a police check post in the tribal area of Khyber Agency on February 12, 2008. The blast occurred about 6 a.m. Tuesday in the Khata Kushta area of Jamrod in the Khyber Agency in Pakistan Federally Administered Tribal Areas. The bridge connected Landi Kotal and Jamrod. Transport has been suspended, and authorities are assessing damages. Engineers also are on location and work is under way to open a temporary route. Details were unclear on the size of the blast, but most of the iron bridge was destroyed, local officials said. No deaths or injuries were immediately reported. Authorities are looking for alternate supply routes for NATO supply trucks and traffic going from Pakistan to Afghanistan, because the route is the main one between the two countries. All vehicles must cross the bridge when going from Peshawar toward the crossing point into Afghanistan. This is the first time militants have targeted a bridge or roadway in efforts to disrupt NATO supplies, a local official said. Previously, militants have targeted truck depots where supply convoys wait to cross into Afghanistan or have attacked trucks on their way through Pakistan and into the Khyber Agency. On Monday, at least 35 suspected militants were killed as part of ongoing operations in the Swat Valley, the Pakistan military confirmed to CNN. Government security forces engaged 70 to 80 suspected militants with artillery and attack helicopters about 11 p.m., after observing their movements in the Khwaza Khela District of the Swat Valley, the military said. Though only 35 militants were confirmed dead, many more were injured in the attack and the death toll was expected to rise, the military said. Also on Monday, a Taliban FM radio sermon announced that militants had killed 16 Pakistan army soldiers in the Swat Valley. Officials at the Swat media center said that report was false.","Suspected Taliban militants blown up a bridge in Pakistan's Khyber Agency region .

"(CNN) -- Artillery shells slammed into a hospital Sunday in the northern Sri Lankan district of Mullaittivu, where civilians -- including a growing number of children -- are being treated as government forces and Tamil rebels continue to clash. A Sri Lankan soldier walks through Mullaittivu, the former military headquarters of the Tamil rebels. More than 200 civilians and at least 30 children have been injured in the last three days of fighting, a relief worker told CNN Sunday. ""That is the absolute minimum (number of injured),"" the aid worker, who did not want to be identified for fear of jeopardizing the work of relief organizations, said. Government officials are accusing aid organizations and foreign media of sensationalizing civilian casualties. ""It looks as if it's convenient for certain agencies to exaggerate the numbers so that this can be converted to a humanitarian crisis in the public eye, "" Secretary of Foreign Affairs Dr. Palitha Kohona told CNN. On Sunday, Sri Lankan Defense Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa promised to ""continue with the military offensive until we liberate the remaining area under LTTE (the rebel group) control,"" according to Sri Lanka's state-run news agency.  Watch a report on civilians caught in fighting » . A ""handful"" of United Nations staff are working around the clock to save a growing number of children caught in the crossfire, a U.N. spokesman said Saturday. Children as young as 4 months old were being treated in local hospitals for shrapnel injuries and other ""wounds of war,"" spokesman James Elder told CNN. ""There is just intense fighting in a small area where children and other civilians are,"" Elder said. ""The space (where conflict is taking place) is shrinking and the fighting is augmenting."" Thursday, U.N. aid workers rescued 50 critically injured children and 105 adults, he said. ""We are trying to get as many people out of there as we can,"" Elder said. Humanitarian groups say as many as 250,000 unprotected civilians are trapped in the area. Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa has promised to allow safe passage to trapped civilians and urged the Tamil Tigers to promise the same. ""We have declared a safe zone for civilians, the coordinates of which were announced by the security forces,"" Rajapaksa said on his government's Web site. ""It is unfortunate that the (Tamil Tiger group) is exploiting this declared safe zone for civilians by placing their heavy artillery within the safe zone and using it as a launching pad to attack security forces and indiscriminately kill civilians."" The fighting has created a ""nightmarish"" situation for civilians in the conflict zone, Elder said. An emerging shortage of humanitarian supplies and diminished access to clean water, sanitation, and food are compounding a crisis, he said. Sunday, Sri Lankan soldiers seized a key rebel stronghold in a surprise attack deep in Tamil held territory. Troops crossed a lagoon and entered the town of Mullaittivu before encountering heavy resistance from Tamil fighters, according to the government-run news agency. The The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) -- commonly known as the Tamil Tigers -- have fought for an independent homeland for the country's ethnic Tamil minority since 1983. The civil war has left more than 70,000 people dead.","Sri Lankan hospital hit by artillery shells .

"BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN) -- Bedraggled, hungry and dazed, the refugees arrived on the shores of Thailand after fleeing one of the most repressive governments in the world -- the hard-line military regime in Myanmar, also known as Burma. This picture provided to CNN is said to show refugees being towed out to sea by the Thai army. But a CNN investigation has uncovered evidence that for hundreds of Rohingya refugees -- members of a Muslim minority group -- abuse and abandonment at sea were what awaited them in Thailand, at the hands of Thai authorities. Extraordinary photos obtained by CNN from someone directly involved in the Thai operation show refugees on their rickety boats being towed out to sea, cut loose and abandoned. One photo shows the Thai army towing a boatload of some 190 refugees far out to sea.  Watch the backstory on the investigation » . For days, accusations have been carried in several regional papers that the Thai army has been systematically towing boat-loads of Rohingya refugees far out to sea and setting them adrift. The army denied it, and the Thai government has launched an inquiry. CNN's investigation -- based on accounts from tourists, sources in Thailand and a Rohingya refugee who said he was on a boat towed back out to sea -- helps to piece together a picture of survival thwarted by an organized effort not just to repel arriving refugees, but to hold them prisoner on shore, drag them in flimsy boats far out to sea and then abandon them.  Watch CNN's investigation into reports of refugees being set adrift » . Three tourists recently voiced concern to CNN over what they had seen -- and in some cases photographed -- near Thailand's tourist areas. One tourist provided CNN with photos last week of refugees detained by Thai authorities on a beach near a tourist site, with the refugees prone on the sun-bleached sand while guards stood nearby. ""Whenever someone raised their head or moved, they [guards] would strike them with a whip,"" said Australian tourist Andrew Catton. A CNN crew traveled to a remote stretch of the Thai coast four hours north of the tourist island of Phuket to investigate the growing reports that the Thai military was secretly detaining Rohingya refugees before towing them out to sea and setting them adrift. In an isolated beach area, debris including sandals and campfire remnants indicated that large numbers of people had been there but were nowhere to be seen. The crew then traveled to a nearby island, where residents reported that refugees who had escaped were living in the jungle. In one hamlet, villagers had captured a Rohingya man they believed had been living in the jungle for days. The refugee, who identified himself as Iqbal Hussain, told CNN he was on one of six boats in a makeshift refugee fleet that arrived in Thailand in December. He said all six boats with their refugee cargo were towed back out to sea in January, and five of the six boats sank. His boat made it back to shore, and he hid in the jungle for days until nearby villagers captured him. In broken English and using sign language and drawings, he described what happened to the other men on the boats: . ""All men dead,"" he said, putting the number of dead at several hundred. The Rohingya, a persecuted minority in Myanmar, have been fleeing their country in rickety boats for years, in search of a better life. In Thailand, many instead have found deprivation and the possibility of desertion far off shore, according to the CNN investigation. The source who provided CNN with photos of refugees in a boat being towed out to sea stressed that the Thai army had given the refugees food and water, but he also confirmed that the boats had been pulled for more than two days into international waters before they were set adrift. His account directly contradicts briefings by senior Thai army sources who denied any such operation was undertaken. A source in the Thai military, after extensive questioning, did confirm to CNN that the Thai army was operating a dump-at-sea policy. But the source defended it, insisting that each boatload of refugees was always given sufficient supplies of food and water. That source claimed local villagers had become afraid of the hundreds of Rohingya arriving each month, and that they were accusing the refugees of stealing their property and threatening them. CNN asked the government for comment and was told that an investigation was being launched and that Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva has plans to call an emergency meeting once the country's foreign minister returns from Cambodia. Panitan Wattanayagorn, a government spokesman, gave no timeline for the foreign minister's return or the emergency meeting. He did say the government is taking the matter very seriously.","CNN finds evidence hundreds of Rohingya refugees abandoned at sea by Thai army .

"(CNN) -- Relatives of missing 5-year-old Haleigh Cummings have given DNA samples, and the mobile home where she lived is no longer off-limits as a crime scene, authorities in Florida said Friday. Haleigh Cummings, 5, was last seen as she was put to bed about 8 p.m. February 9. The blue double-wide trailer near the tiny town of Satsuma, Florida, has been turned over to the child's father, but he does not plan to live there, said Capt. Dick Schauland of the Putnam County Sheriff's office. The 25-year-old father, Ronald Cummings, ""is just not comfortable"" living in the trailer where his daughter was last seen, Schauland said. Authorities have collected DNA samples from Haleigh's father, her mother and other people connected to the case, including the father's 17-year-old girlfriend, Misty Croslin, Schauland added. Police have said they think Haleigh was abducted but have provided few details of their investigation.  Watch Hailey's grandmother plead for her return » . Croslin said she tucked Haleigh and her 4-year-old brother into bed about 8 p.m. February 9. She said she went to sleep herself about 10 p.m. but woke at 3 a.m. to find Haleigh missing and a back door propped open by bricks. Ronald Cummings called police and reported his daughter missing when he returned from work at dawn. Haleigh's younger brother later told family members that a man dressed in black came into the trailer and took Haleigh from her bed. Go inside Haleigh's bedroom . Authorities have used cadaver dogs to search the area near the trailer. The searches were suspended a week ago, Schauland said. Haleigh was reported missing on the same day a memorial service was held for Caylee Anthony, a Florida girl who had been missing for months before her remains were found in December. Her mother has been charged with murder. Haleigh's case received wide publicity as television crews made the short trip from Caylee's service in Orlando to Haleigh's home in Satsuma, east of Gainesville in northern Florida. Caylee Anthony's grandfather, a former police officer, later traveled to the command post to comfort and advise the missing child's father. Family members of Ronald Cummings and Haleigh's mother, Crystal Sheffield, set up camp under tents near the police command post, going on camera to beg for the child's safe return. The relationship between Cummings and Sheffield has been described as ""rocky."" The two shared custody of the children, with each parent caring for the children every other weekend. Schauland said authorities have received about 2,400 tips from across the country: ""all kinds of folks, psychics."" Asked how the family was holding up, he said, ""It's really tough on them, as you can imagine. ... I can't imagine what they're going through.""","Missing child Haleigh Cummings' kin give DNA samples .

"(CNN) -- An outspoken Saudi human rights advocate who was imprisoned without charge for nearly eight months was freed this weekend, according to a fellow human rights activist. Matrook al-Faleh, shown in 2004, was seized after he criticized prison conditions, says Human Rights Watch. Matrook al-Faleh ""is doing very well"" after leaving Al-Hayer maximum security prison near Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, late Saturday, said colleague Mohammed al-Qahtani, who visited al-Faleh on Sunday. ""He is very healthy and his morale is quite high -- surprisingly after eight months,"" said al-Qahtani. Both men are Saudi college professors. It's unclear why al-Faleh was arrested. A Human Rights Watch report condemning the arrest and urging al-Faleh's release said his detention came two days after he publicly criticized conditions in a prison where two other Saudi human rights activists are imprisoned. It was also unclear why he was held for so long. According to al-Qahtani, Saudi law mandates that no one can be held for more than six months without charge. ""The criminal code says you charge him or release him, but sometimes they do not respect the law they issued,"" al-Qahtani said. An official at the Saudi Interior Ministry said he had no details about al-Faleh's case. Jamila al-Uqla, al-Faleh's wife, spoke to CNN in May, shortly after her husband was detained. She described how her husband had been arrested without charge and interrogated repeatedly. Al-Faleh had decided to go on a hunger strike to demand that he be told why he was being held, she said. His wife stressed that she and al-Faleh are patriotic Saudis. ""My husband is transparent and doesn't hide anything,"" said al-Uqla. ""He says whatever he sees. He has loyalty to his country and the interests of his country."" It was not Al-Faleh's first brush with the Saudi legal system. Al-Faleh, Abdullah al-Hamid and Ali al-Dumaini, who runs a Saudi discussion Web site, were arrested in 2004 for circulating a petition meant for then-Crown Prince Abdullah which called for a constitution guaranteeing basic human rights. A court sentenced al-Faleh, Abdullah al-Hamid and Ali al-Dumaini, to six, seven and nine years respectively. But King Abdullah pardoned them in August 2005, Human Rights Watch said.","Saudi professor Matrook al-Faleh imprisoned for eight months without charge .

"(CNN) -- Almost three years after losing her right leg in a bomb explosion in Iraq, Tara Hutchinson decided to post her photo and profile online to ask for help. Dave Mahler spent his entire career in technology and decided to apply his know-how to help veterans. The soldier was having financial problems last fall and needed $1,000 for one month's mortgage on her house in San Antonio, Texas, where she is being treated for her injuries. Her husband, who is also in the Army, is still deployed in Iraq. Hutchinson, 32, is among dozens of active-duty U.S. troops and veterans who have asked for help through USAtogether.org, which listed their stories and specific needs online. The charity is one of many set up to help U.S. troops beyond the compensation and benefits the government offers, but it's not run by a church group, a veterans association or even a military family.  Watch how some veterans are having tough times back home » . Instead, it was founded by a group of Silicon Valley professionals in California. The project is the brainchild of Dave Mahler, whose résumé includes an engineering degree, 13 years at Hewlett-Packard designing servers and software, co-founding a start-up and serving on nonprofit boards -- but no military background. Mahler also happens to live four miles from a Veterans Affairs hospital in Palo Alto, which he had driven past for 25 years but never visited, he said. It was on his mind a year and a half ago when he was looking for a new community service project and decided to focus his energy on helping U.S. troops hurt in the line of duty. Hatching a plan over coffee . Mahler described what he did next as a ""very startup-oriented thing."" He called a senior person at the hospital out of the blue and invited her out for coffee to learn how he could help. Mahler said he was ready to sweep the halls or read to a veteran but envisioned something with more leverage. ""I had a bias towards wanting to use the things that we've learned in Silicon Valley and across the country in building Internet properties to apply that technology into this arena,"" Mahler said. So after finding out that there was usually an outpouring of help once a community knew about a veteran's financial plight, he decided to start a Web site showcasing specific stories and needs. Anyone who wanted to help could browse through the requests and decide exactly whom to support. Mahler, 52, said the goal was to get rid of all the bureaucracy in the process by combining elements of Craigslist -- the popular go-to place for online classifieds and forums -- and Kiva.org, a micro-lending Web site that lets users browse profiles of entrepreneurs in the developing world and choose someone to give a small loan to. ""The unique thing about Kiva, and to some extent Craigslist, is that it's one to one. You're not giving money to some organization and then they decide who to give it to,"" Mahler said. Visitors to USAtogether.org can search for requests by ZIP code, branch of service or type of need. Requests can be filled quickly, so the organization is looking for more service members and their families to list their needs, Mahler said. A recent visit to the site showed only two open appeals for help. Hutchinson said her request for assistance with a mortgage payment was filled within a couple of months of posting and has made a big difference.

Direct financial assistance is limited to $1,000, for example, and someone asking for a plasma-screen TV might be coached to request help with an electric bill instead. The assistance is meant to be a short-term safety net, so service members with recurring financial problems are referred to the many other groups that help veterans. Hearing the service members' stories can take a toll on the team, Mahler said.

"(Tribune Media Services) -- Two young Iranian parents smiled at me, showing mock desperation as their little boy and girl eagerly dragged them into a shop famous for its pistachio ice cream sandwiches. Around the corner, filling the side of a 15-story building, a government-sponsored propaganda mural showed a perverted American flag, with skulls for stars and falling bombs for stripes. Iranian women must wear a scarf, but many leave a tuft of hair showing at the forehead. That bizarre mixture -- of saber-rattling politics alongside the personal warmth of individual locals -- is what struck me on my recent 12-day trip to Iran to film a public-television show. I found Iran to be perhaps the most misunderstood and fascinating land I've ever visited. And I learned a lot. The country is not free. It seems that people -- motivated by fear of Western influences and love of their children -- have forgone democracy for their theocracy. Parents told me, ""We do not want our girls to grow up to be Britney Spears,"" and they are willing to sacrifice some freedom to achieve that goal. They feel their ""revolution of values"" provides an environment where they can raise their children free from the cheap sex, drug abuse and crass materialism of the West. Iranian women must wear a scarf, but many leave a tuft of hair showing at the forehead. After several days, that provocative tuft attracted my eye like cleavage. Making sure that what they can show is as beautiful as possible, Iranian women, per capita, lead the world in nose jobs. Faces are beautifully made up, and -- when so much else is covered -- can be particularly expressive and mysterious. Eye contact is riveting. Before arriving in Iran, I was so afraid of anti-Americanism that we had nearly left our big expensive TV camera in Athens and considered flying in with a less obtrusive model. But once there, I found people curious, courteous and quick to smile -- especially when they learned we were American. I've never had such fun with people or found them so chatty than on the streets of Iran. Tehran is modern and bustling, with thriving shopping malls, cars clogging the streets and most people wearing Western-style clothes. Unlike many Muslim capitals, minarets do not dot the skyline, and I barely heard a call to prayer. And yet it's clearly a theocracy. Multiple TV stations broadcast religious programming (along with BBC and CNN) that's perfect for praying -- images of the sun setting on the sea, or the pilgrimage center in Mecca in real-time. In the United States, billboards and ads encourage us to consume, but in Iran, government-sponsored billboards, Muzak and TV programming is all about the teachings of great holy men. I asked my guide if it's okay to be non-Muslim in Iran. ""Yes,"" he said, ""We have religious freedom, as long as it is not offensive to Islam."" Christian? ""Sure."" Jewish? ""Sure."" Bahai? ""No. We believe that Mohammed -- who came in the 7th century -- was the last prophet, so the Bahai prophet (19th century) is offensive to Islam."" I asked, ""What if you want to get somewhere in the military or government?"" My guide answered, ""Then you better be a Muslim -- a practicing, Shiite Muslim."" Every film crew stops at the former U.S. Embassy. It was here in 1979 that a gang of revolutionary students stormed what they called the ""Den of Spies"" and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. For Iranians back then, it was a proud moment of triumph against the nation that had meddled in their affairs for years. The embassy wall is still covered with anti-American murals painted at that time. But the hostage crisis was 30 years ago. Most Iranians weren't even born then. It's ancient history to our young guide. With our work done, we hurried to catch our flight home. As we crawled through Tehran's traffic, our driver cursed, ""Death to traffic."" Shocked, I said, ""What? I thought it was death to America."" He said, ""Here in Iran, when something frustrates us and is out of our control, we say 'death' to that."" Then I thought, when people in my society say, ""Damn those teenagers,"" they don't mean they wish them to die and burn in hell for eternity ... they just want the kids to turn down the music. Boarding our plane, the Air France flight attendants -- so stylish with hair flowing freely -- seemed to welcome us as if onto a life raft. Women pulled off their scarves, wine was poured, and we flew west with the raw footage of a program we hoped would humanize a proud country of 70 million people.

"(CNN) -- Deep-sea explorers say they have solved ""one of the greatest mysteries in naval history"" with the discovery of what was ""the world's mightiest and most technically advanced warship"" when it sank in 1744. The HMS Victory sank in 1744. The HMS Victory -- the predecessor to a historic British flagship of the same name -- was found ""far from where history says it was lost,"" Odyssey Marine Exploration said in a news release Monday. The find in the English Channel exonerates Adm. Sir John Balchin, one of ""the greatest admirals in English history,"" because it shows that the ship went down in a violent storm, not due to any mistakes he made, Odyssey said. It did not specify the ship's exact location. Maritime lore said the ship went down in the northern part of the Channel Islands, south of England near the coast of France. Stories about treasures -- including gold -- that may have been on the ship have existed ever since its disappearance. This HMS Victory was a predecessor to the historic British ship that took the same name and which served as Admiral Nelson's flagship in the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. In court papers seeking exclusive salvage rights, Odyssey says the wreck site ""consists of cannons and other unidentified objects. Odyssey believes that potentially valuable cargo may be located at or near the site."" The papers were filed in U.S. District Court in Tampa, Florida, where Odyssey is based, seeking exclusive salvage rights. There were nearly 1,000 people aboard -- ""900 sailors, plus a complement of marines and 50 volunteers drawn from the noblest families of England,"" Odyssey said in information about the ship released together with the Discovery Channel, which chronicled the find. Based on reports from the time, there may be as much as four tons of gold on the ship, Odyssey and the Discovery Channel said. ""Additional research indicates that there were large quantities of both silver and gold coins aboard. ... Research suggests that this prize money will also likely be located at the wreck site. ""... However, no coins have been located at the site to date, and no accurate assessment as to their value can be made prior to location, recovery and analysis."" The potential treasure also comes in another form -- bronze weaponry. ""The site's anticipated ordnance collection"" includes ""the single largest collection of bronze cannon in the world"" and ""the largest consignment of bronze guns ever manufactured and preserved today,"" Odyssey said. Two cannons have been recovered -- ""a 12-pounder featuring the royal arms of George II"" and a ""42-pounder bearing the crest of George I,"" it said. ""The huge 42-pounder recovered is the only known example of a gun of this type and size currently in existence on dry land. The only other artifacts recovered to date were two small brick fragments that were brought into U.S. federal court in order to file an admiralty arrest of the site."" Admiralty arrest is a step mandated under international maritime law. The discovery could set up a legal battle with the British government. If it really is the HMS Victory, ""her remains are sovereign immune,"" the British Ministry of Defense (MOD) said in a statement on its blog Monday. ""The wreck remains the property of the Crown. We have not waived our rights to it. This means that no intrusive action may be taken without the express consent of the United Kingdom."" In its statement, Odyssey said it ""has been cooperating closely"" with the ministry, and ""all activities at the site have been conducted in accordance with protocols agreed with MOD and Royal Navy officials."" The ship has deteriorated to the point that recovering it is impossible, Odyssey said. ""A plan is being developed for an archaeological excavation of the site, and artifacts will be recovered in accordance with a scientific project plan, which will be submitted to the UK MOD for review and approval."" The company has proposed that it be paid ""with either ... a percentage of the value of the collection that has been recovered, conserved and presented to the UK government, or a percentage of the coins or other artifacts that the government decides to (sell)."" The ship was found nearly 100 km (62 miles) ""from where the ship was historically believed to have been wrecked on a reef near the Channel Islands,"" Odyssey's statement said. ""Having discovered it in deep water far from where history says it was lost has served to exonerate Admiral Balchin and his officers from the accusation of having let the ship run aground on the Casquets due to faulty navigation,"" said Greg Stemm, Odyssey's chief executive officer, in the statement. Odyssey said the ""prevailing belief"" about the ship's fate was that it had ""smashed into the Casquets, a group of rocky islets"" north of Guernsey, the second largest of the Channel Islands. But the evidence, Odyssey's statement said, suggests ""the ship sank as the result of a violent storm and suggests that the design and construction of the ship contributed to her loss."" Odyssey released press materials about the ship in cooperation with the Discovery Channel, which chronicled the find and will be showing it in a program this week called Treasure Quest. ""The English Channel is a treacherous place to navigate,"" Discovery Channel President John Ford told CNN Radio. ""The ship was returning from Portugal and got caught up in a storm. And despite being judged unsinkable at the time, sort of like the Titanic was, this very, very large ship went down in a storm and vanished without a trace.""

"(CNN) -- Madonna said she hopes the Malawian girl she wants to adopt and the boy she already adopted ""will one day return to Malawi and help the people of their country."" A judge has rejected Madonna's adoption application. A Malawian judge this month rejected the American pop star's petition to adopt 3-year-old Chifundo ""Mercy"" James, but her lawyer has filed an appeal. ""I want to provide Mercy with a home, a loving family environment and the best education and health care possible,"" Madonna said in an e-mail to The Nation, a Malawian newspaper. ""And it's my hope that she, like David, will one day return to Malawi and help the people of their country."" Madonna's statement, which her publicist provided to CNN, steered away from commenting on her legal battle. ""Though I have been advised that I cannot publicly discuss the pending appeal regarding my desire to adopt Mercy, I do want to say how much I appreciate the level of support that I have received from the people of Malawi and my friends around the world,"" she said. The judge who ruled against the adoption said she had ""a gripping temptation"" to approve it, but decided doing so would open doors to child trafficking, court records show. ""Anyone could come to Malawi and quickly arrange for an adoption that might have grave consequences on the very children that the law seeks to protect,"" Justice E.J. Chombo wrote in her ruling. The judge also said she thought the child was in good hands at an orphanage. Another Malawian judge approved Madonna's adoption of David Banda in 2006. Chombo's ruling followed weeks of criticism by human-rights activists, who accused the mother of three of using her fame to circumvent a residency law for foreigners adopting in the southern African country. Save the Children UK had also urged Madonna to let the child be raised by her relatives in her home community. The denial was applauded by a coalition of Malawian nonprofits. ""Inter-country adoption is not the best way of providing protection to children. ... Supporting children from outside our country only helps five of the 1.5 million orphans we have,"" said Mavuto Bamusi, national coordinator of the Malawi Human Rights Consultative Committee. Malawi government officials have said that they supported Madonna's second adoption. The recently divorced singer was married to British filmmaker Guy Ritchie. She has been involved with Malawi for several years and made a documentary, ""I Am Because We Are,"" to highlight poverty, AIDS and other diseases devastating children in that country. She also co-founded a nonprofit, Raising Malawi, which provides programs to help the needy.","Madonna is appealing a Malawian judge's rejection of her adoption petition .

"LOUISVILLE, Kentucky (CNN) -- Chilling winds and more snow were expected for Kentucky on Tuesday, bad news for more than a quarter of a million people still without power after an ice storm. Ice covers nearly everything in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, Tuesday. Forecasters said as much as 3 inches of snow could fall in areas of Kentucky, one of several states dealing with snow. The snowfall could hamper efforts of Kentucky National Guard troops that have been going door-to-door to check on families. The storm has been blamed for at least 16 deaths, several from carbon-monoxide poisoning caused by exhaust from generators, authorities said. Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear has called the ice storm ""the biggest natural disaster that this state has ever experienced in modern history."" Beshear toured areas in western Kentucky over the weekend, the hardest hit area, where National Guard troops also were focusing their efforts. In a statement, Beshear said the call-up of troops ""represents the strongest possible effort to relieve human suffering and ensure the safety and well-being of our citizens."" iReport.com: Share photos of icy, snowy weather in your town . One of the people guard members checked on was 83-year-old Paul Jenkins, who was using water stored in buckets, had no power and was relying on kerosene for heat. ""When we lose power, we're in trouble 'cause all we got is electric,"" said Jenkins, who lives in Breckinridge County west of Louisville. Kentucky wasn't the only place battling icy conditions. The National Weather Service put out winter storm advisories Tuesday for areas in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Virginia. In many areas, trees remain in roads or even on homes. Louisville resident John Randolph pointed to tree branches that fell onto his two-story suburban home. ""Just the overall power of the branches falling was actually pretty frightening"" when the ice storm was setting in, Randolph said. He added: ""The baby slept through the night and didn't wake up once. My wife and I, once we heard the first branches falling, we didn't go back to sleep the whole night. We didn't know what to do. ... Ultimately, we sort of just stayed in our bedrooms, and I just kind of went outside periodically and assessed the situation."" Randolph's home -- which escaped serious damage -- is among those without power.  See images of the ice storm's aftermath » . Arthur Byrn, mayor of Mayfield -- one of the cities suffering from the storm -- told CNN Radio that authorities were conducting a ""door-to-door welfare check of the entire Graves County area, which is 38,000 people."" Graves County is in the southwest corner of Kentucky, near the Missouri and Tennessee lines. Byrn said it could take as long as two months for the county to have 100 percent of its power back. iReport.com: Tour ice storm damage in Elizabethtown, Kentucky .

"(CNN) -- Norway has condemned the ransacking of the Sri Lankan embassy in Oslo by Tamil demonstrators. The entrance to Sri Lanka's embassy in Oslo on Sunday. Video posted on Norway's TV 2 Web site showed demonstrators smashing through re-enforced glass at the embassy on Sunday. The aftermath showed embassy offices that had been trashed, with furniture, artwork and potted plants dumped on the floor. Countertops had been bashed and splintered. ""Please help the Tamils. Stop the massacre of Tamils,"" a sign carried by one of the demonstrators said. The foreign ministry said it has requested that police tighten security at the embassy, which is located in an office building. ""I deeply deplore the fact that unauthorized persons unlawfully forced their way into the Sri Lankan embassy in Oslo and caused extensive damage,"" said Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Store. ""This is a violation of Norwegian law and an action that is totally unacceptable."" Rohitha Bogollagama, Sri Lanka's foreign affairs minister, called for authorities to ""seek immediate arrest of the perpetrators of this serious act of terror"" during a CNN interview in New Delhi, India. The attack came as Sri Lanka's president ordered military troops to restrict their offensive against Tamil Tiger rebels while the nation celebrates the Sinhala and Tamil New Year. The two-day celebrations began Monday. The order was meant to allow the thousands of Tamils trapped by the fighting to travel for the New Year, said a statement from the office of President Mahinda Rajapakse. Troops are in the midst of an intense military push in northern Sri Lanka, where they have snatched back large swaths of land from the Tamil rebels. The rebels have fought for an independent homeland for the country's ethnic Tamil minority since 1983. The civil war has left more than 70,000 people dead. A statement on the Sri Lankan defense ministry Web site called on Norway to ""bring the perpetrators to justice immediately."" ""The perpetrators can be readily identified on the CCTV recording which has been made available to the authorities,"" the statement said.

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN)  -- Florida Law enforcement officials said Monday they had launched an investigation into a tragic boating accident near St. Augustine, Florida, that took the lives of five people and seriously injured seven others. CNN affiliate WJXT shows the scene of the deadly boating accident near Jacksonville, Florida, on Sunday. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission has taken over as the lead agency involved in the investigation. The incident took place on Sunday around 7:15 p.m., in the intracoastal waterway in St. Johns County, Florida, about 20 miles north of St. Augustine. According to FWC investigators, a 22-foot boat with 12 people on board rammed into the rear and right side of a 25-foot tugboat. ""We are still investigating and haven't come to any conclusions yet,"" said Carol Pratt, spokeswoman for FWC. She said they still do not know who was driving the boat. They also are waiting for victims' next of kin to be notified before releasing any of their names and ages. The tugboat was at a dock and boat launch under construction on the Intracoastal Waterway in Palm Valley, said Jeremy Robshaw, a spokesman for St. Johns County Fire and Rescue. Robshaw said rescuers couldn't initially reach the end of the unfinished dock, but laid plywood sheets on the structure to get to crash victims. No one was onboard the tugboat, which is registered to F&A Enterprises in St. Augustine. The seven injured were taken to Shands Jacksonville Hospital in Jacksonville, Florida. Two patients remain in critical condition, one is considered serious and three are in fair condition. A hospital spokesman did not have information on the seventh victim. FWC told CNN that they hope to release more information on the incident and on their investigation. As in any accident, toxicology studies will be done on the driver of the boat, to determine whether he or she was impaired, spokesman Carol Pratt told CNN.","Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission takes lead in the investigation.

"(CNN) -- Chris Nowinski's professional wrestling career didn't end with a pink slip or a celebratory sendoff, but with a swift kick to his chin. Chris Nowinski was a WWE wrestler when he suffered a concussion, but didn't realize how badly he was hurt. Nowinski played college football at Harvard -- a defensive tackle. He was a promising newcomer to World Wrestling Entertainment. At the time he suffered the injury -- the hit that would cut his career short -- he was performing in a summer 2003 tag-team match as his WWE character, Chris Harvard, a blonde, blue-eyed symbol of Ivy League elitism. Nowinski didn't know he had suffered a concussion. He didn't know that he shouldn't have been wrestling immediately afterward, and he didn't know that this was probably the sixth concussion of his athletic career. There was a lot Nowinski didn't know about concussions. Hard hits were nothing new to Nowinski, 28, a tree of a man who had played sports since childhood. Blows to the head punctuated many of the games and matches in his career, he said. Sometimes he blacked out. ""The sky would change colors, or I would see stars, and get really dizzy, and I would just collect myself on the field or in the ring, and continue going, because that's what I thought I was supposed to do,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview. ""I didn't realize that it was a serious brain injury."" Nowinski continued to wrestle, which aggravated the injury, he said. He developed post-concussion syndrome, a condition characterized by prolonged concussion symptoms. ""After my last concussion ... I was stuck with four years of headaches and immediate memory problems and depression and sleep-walking,"" Nowinski said. He said he still endures migraines and memory loss. ""My head just feels differently all the time,"" he said. Concussions are common, particularly among athletes in heavy contact sports. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that at least 300,000 sports-related concussions occur annually in the United States. Nowinski waited a year and a half for his head to clear so he could return to the ring -- a day that never came. So, the fallen wrestler decided to change what he considers the sports world's biggest liability. He's now on a mission to eliminate the ""damage"" from head injuries in athletics. His task is two-fold: To educate coaches, parents and athletes about identifying and treating concussions and to help facilitate research to pin down the injury's long-term effects. ""I knew I had the information that could prevent suffering for a lot of people, a lot of people that I cared about,"" said Nowinski. ""It wouldn't have been right for me to just go on with my life, make money, do whatever, while that information just sat in my head."" He wrote ""Head Games: Football's Concussion Crisis from the NFL to Youth Leagues,"" published in 2006. He's been speaking before youth leagues, sports conferences and other public events for more than three years. And he and a group of top neurologists have recently formed The Sports Legacy Institute. Part of that organization's purpose will be to study the effects of multiple head injuries, investigating cases of a condition called chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, Nowinski said. CTE is a dementia-like condition caused by repetitive blows to the head over an extended period of time, according to the National Institute of Health. Hoping to prove to the rest of the world that multiple concussions have permanent, sometimes ruinous consequences, Nowinski began to work with a University of Pittsburgh neuropathologist, Dr. Bennet Omalu, who found the condition in the brains of two deceased former National Football League players, Terry Long and Mike Webster. With Nowinski's help in obtaining the brain tissue, Omalu diagnosed the condition in two other former players who died, Andre Waters and Justin Strzelczyk. Both Long and Waters committed suicide. In the case of Waters, Omalu said, ""Major depression was the cause of his suicide ... And the underlying causation here was trauma."" But aside from the research and studies that garner headlines and national attention, a large part of Nowinski's task lies in his clear-spoken testimony. In smaller groups, in schools and other events, often away from the stare of the cameras, Nowinski tells people what he knows. Despite the repeated occurrence of concussions amid practice, games or matches, Nowinski says many coaches and players -- from youth leagues to professionals - still don't know how to properly treat concussions or even how to identify them. And what's worse, he said, just like in his case, athletes often try to play while they are still injured. A second concussion suffered while a player is recovering from the first could result in death, according to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons. Furthermore, some studies show that there are cumulative long-term effects from multiple concussions. Nowinksi says he's had mixed reactions to his message. Some, like Carmen Roda, president of the Westport, Connecticut-based PAL football program, say Nowinski's lecture is imperative for coaches. ""Bottom line, if they care about kids, they should listen to this lecture,"" Roda said. Others have shown more resistance. ""I['ll] go to schools to speak, and the football coach will refuse to show up to the talk,"" Nowinski said. But the former wrestler says the biggest hurdle to better practice and treatment of concussions are the professional sports leagues. He is particularly critical of the NFL. ""They need their best players on the field to sell tickets,"" Nowinski said. ""And a lot of these problems from playing through concussions don't show up until these guys are retired. So their incentive to protect them while they're players is not where it should be."" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell says the league puts its players' interests as first priority and the individual teams ""do an excellent job in the care and management of concussions that affect NFL players."" Dr. Joseph Maroon, the neurosurgeon for the Pittsburgh Steelers and a member of the league's committee on mild-traumatic brain injury, applauds the NFL's efforts to protect its players. Asked about studies that suggest long-term damage from concussions, Maroon said there are other factors that could affect the ability of a person's brain to function normally. ""It's extremely difficult and quite impossible to ascribe problems that develop 20 or 30 years after someone played to a concussion that's experienced 20 or 30 years before,"" he said. Nowinski said players still do not understand the seriousness of concussions. They need to be educated, he said, and the ""tough-it-out"" culture inherent to football and other sports needs to change. ""If within a few years, everybody doesn't know that playing through concussions is a terrible idea, then I'll be surprised and disappointed,"" he said. ""The idea is we make the change that needs to be made as quickly as possible,"" Nowinski said. ""And then I can do something else.""

"AUGUSTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Walking into the Colur Tyme Tattoo Parlor is a lot like walking into a head shop. One wall is lined with gang monikers and symbols, the other with bongs for smoking marijuana and other drugs -- one even shaped like a skull. The Colur Tyme Tattoo Parlor was set up by authorities to get at the heart of gang members. Only this head shop was a setup. It was a police front in a sting operation to bust gangs in this Georgia river city that most people associate with the Masters Tournament -- not violent thugs with high-powered weapons. Authorities said some guns sold to the shop were used in crimes just hours earlier. The tattoo parlor was the brainchild of Richmond County Sheriff Ron Strength, who wanted to snuff out gangs carrying out violent crimes in his east Georgia community. The idea was to create a place where the gang members would feel right at home, said sheriff's Lt. Scott Peebles. And that they did. ""We put the idea in their heads that there's no way these guys are in law enforcement,"" he said. On Wednesday, more than 100 sheriff's officers, state investigators and agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives carried out a major bust after an 18-month joint investigation into the gang activity.  Watch cops set up tattoo parlor » . Sixty-eight suspects were arrested on charges ranging from trafficking of illegal weapons to serious drug offenses. Authorities seized more than 300 weapons, including high-powered assault rifles. Rich Marianos, a special agent with the ATF, said such gang activity is spreading across the nation, with small-town gangs increasing their ties with gangs in major cities. For instance, New York gangs have begun moving as far south as the Carolinas, where they set up operations to buy and sell guns and drugs, he said. Chicago gang activity extends more than 60 miles into the Illinois city's suburbs for narcotics and weapons trading. In fact, Marianos said the ATF has begun seeing some Chicago gangs establishing a ""pipeline"" for illegal arms more than 500 miles away in Mississippi. ""It's not just an urban problem,"" Marianos said. ""We're seeing it all over the country."" The ATF, he said, has seen one of the most dramatic increases in gang activity in the last three years and is cracking down. ""We want to look at a way to go after these offenders and prevent it before it happens,"" he said. ""[We're] making the community safer by disarming the bad guys -- not taking guns away from the American citizen, but going after the people who shouldn't have them in the first place."" That's why setting up a tattoo parlor in Augusta was key. Strength, the Richmond County sheriff, said he remembers when the worst crimes in these parts were lawn mower thefts and vandals pushing over birdbaths. But those days are long gone, with gangs such as the Georgia Deadly Boys and Fairington Gangster Thugs causing mayhem on a regular basis. ""In the past 2 1/2 years, we've noticed some major changes,"" he said, ""with the type of criminal offenses they were involved in."" So he devised the undercover business. The Colur Tyme Tattoo Parlor on Tobacco Road was set up on the outskirts of Augusta. It's a location not heavily patrolled by police, but staffed 100 percent by undercover agents. Business was slow at first, but then things took off. Gang members soon began dropping in to sell guns, drugs and even stolen cars, authorities said. Every transaction was recorded by surveillance cameras around the store. Soon the shop had so much business the Richmond County Sheriff's Office had to call in reinforcements from the ATF. Four federal agents helped the sheriff's deputies man the counters; others worked behind the scenes. Vanessa McLemore, ATF special agent in charge, said the teams had to coordinate their behaviors so it seemed like they fit in the store. ""They spent a lot of time together learning each other's mannerisms, learning each other's body language. It had to be a brotherhood,"" she said. On the store counter was a jar of colored markers to invite clients to write their favorite gang affiliation on the wall. Peebles said agents used the wall for intelligence.

"(CNN) -- Bolivians are widely expected to approve a new constitution Sunday that would allow leftist President Evo Morales to run for another term this year, which he can't do under the current document. The new constitution would eliminate term limits and allow President Evo Morales to run again for president. The new constitution would replace the 1967 charter and give greater voice to the indigenous people who make up most of the country. It would also give more power to the central government. Morales, speaking at rallies in La Paz and Cochabamba this week, said the new document will propel the nation. ""Once approved, this will be the refoundation of Bolivia and the refoundation of a new state where there will be equality and we will all have the same rights and the same obligations,"" he said. Others say the referendum is a way for Morales to keep himself in power, a move that could plunge the country into further violence, division and uncertainty. That effort, critics say, is in ample evidence as some regions fight to break away and as the deaths of up to 30 peasant government supporters a few months ago led to accusations of a right-wing massacre. ""What will be opened is a new chapter of violence,"" said Carlos Toranzo, an investigator in La Paz with the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, a policy institute associated with the Social Democratic Party of Germany. As campaigning on Sunday's referendum came to a close Thursday with massive festive rallies for each side, Bolivians gave voice to the chasm that separates them. ""What this constitutional project does is divide us,"" said Fernanda San Martin, who was at the final opposition rally in the city of Santa Cruz. ""What it does is feed hate and racism in the country."" Efrain Tico Quispe, at a rally in favor of the new constitution, sees it from a different perspective. ""For them, it's division. It doesn't benefit them,"" he said. ""But for humble people of our class, it serves us well."" The referendum has two parts: a straight yes-or-no vote on adopting the new constitution and a question asking Bolivians whether the maximum amount of private property that can be owned should be 5,000 or 10,000 hectares (12,355 or 24,710 acres). The wide-ranging constitution would give the government a greater role in the economy and more control over natural resources, broaden nationalization of private industries and increase the rights of indigenous people. The new document also would eliminate term limits for all elected offices and would allow the president to run for re-election to a second consecutive five-year term. The current constitution limits the president to one five-year term. Under provisions of the new constitution, current terms would not be counted, so Morales could run in December and in 2014. In return for support for the constitution, Morales reportedly has agreed not to run in 2014 if he wins this year. But Morales, who was elected in December 2005 by the largest margin since civilian rule was restored in 1982, would still be in office for nine years. That part bothers those who see the vote as a way for Morales to keep himself in power. Peter Hakim, president of the Inter-American Dialogue policy institute in Washington, warns against politicians ""who use democracy to concentrate power."" Sunday's vote comes after a long and troubled path that saw the referendum postponed three times. Morales, who campaigned on a promise to change the constitution, convened a constitutional assembly in July 2006, with a referendum scheduled for August 2007. The assembly did not have a draft document ready until December 2007. After much wrangling and accusations that opponents were locked out of crucial votes, the Bolivian congress approved a referendum in February 2008, scheduling it for May. But the government suspended that vote in March because some of the nation's nine departments, or states, wanted to hold local referendums on greater autonomy during the May balloting. In August, Morales said the referendum would be held in December. That vote also was postponed after unrest in Pando department in which pro-government peasants were killed. In October, an agreement was reached to hold the referendum January 25, 2009. Hakim and others understand why many Bolivians are eager for the vote, particularly in a country with 85 percent indigenous or mestizo lineage and only 15 percent white. ""There's a certain amount of ethnic identity that's involved. That's really important,"" said Peter DeShazo, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ""People believe that somehow this is going to translate into something positive for their lives."" A turning point came with the election of Morales, the nation's first Indian president. ""In Bolivia, you have a society that was very segregated,"" Hakim said. ""There was a lot of repression against Indian groups. There's a lot of impatience in the country. They feel that past governments have neglected them. They feel that the international communities and the United States have ignored them."" Morales, who won a recall vote last summer by a two-thirds margin, also is eager for a vote. The referendum is as much about him as it is the constitution. ""It's a very important development,"" said Erasto Almeida, an analyst with the Eurasia Group, a political research and consulting firm. ""Morales came into office with an agenda of radical change. The new constitution is an important step to consolidate this agenda."" Analysts and everyday Bolivians agree that the referendum is nearly certain to pass. DeShazo notes that more than 100 new laws will be required to put the constitution into play. That will take time. Almeida points out that Morales had to compromise on many issues ""as the result of a long and difficult negotiation."" More than 100 of the 411 articles in the constitution Morales' party drafted in 2007 were changed as a result of negotiations with congress, DeShazo said. ""The fact that Morales made concessions and made the constitution more moderate makes the constitution more resilient,"" Almeida said. He sees a couple of ways in which the opposition might try to make trouble for Morales. ""He's going to get about two-thirds [of the vote]. That's what's expected,"" Almeida said. ""If he gets lower, you could have more tension because the opposition will be emboldened."" If Morales gets significantly more of the vote than expected and tries to ram through his agenda, the opposition also could be energized, Almeida said. Toranzo, the La Paz investigator with the Ebert Foundation, has a more dire forecast. ""From Monday on,"" he said, ""Bolivians won't know what to respect: what was before or what will come. This will destabilize the country."" He also thinks Bolivia's faltering economy may factor into Sunday's vote. The constitution was formulated, he said, ""during a time of fat cows, but it is being voted on during a time of skinny cows."" Though spirited, the campaign has been relatively trouble-free. About 3.8 million Bolivians are eligible to cast ballots in the mandatory voting. Jennifer McCoy, director of the Americas Program at the Carter Center, is head of a nine-person group of observers sent by former President Carter, who frequently monitors elections. The Organization of American States has sent a 65-person delegation, and the European Union has 45 observers, she said. ""It's fairly quiet now. It's fairly calm,"" she said Friday. ""There were some protesters. There was a little bit of rock-throwing. But there has been no real violence, no deaths. There's more real calm than previous events in Bolivia."" Hakim agrees, to a point. ""It's a drama that's playing itself out now,"" he said. ""The degree of polarization and friction does not leave me terribly optimistic. On the other hand, things haven't gotten out of hand.""

"(AOL Autos) -- Regular readers of AOL Autos know that we have done a series of stories on the development and increasing popularity of cars that run -- or will eventually run -- on alternative fuels. The mandatory use of CNG in public service vehicles began in New Delhi, India in 2000. We've written about hybrids, clean-diesel engines, fuel-cell technology, ethanol and more. That brings us to another entry in the auto industry's ongoing research and development of green-technology: compressed natural gas (CNG). Scientists are trying to determine which alternative fuel will best strike a balance between being environmentally friendly and commercial viability. CNG might be the answer. Vehicles running on CNG have actually been around since the early 1990s, but have not been a dominant force in the marketplace mostly because the infrastructure (i.e. re-fueling stations) is not yet in place to support high-volume sales of CNG-powered cars. Presently, there are only about 1,600 CNG refueling stations in the U.S, compared with up to 200,000 gas stations. Currently there is only one CNG-powered model sold on the consumer market that is actually manufactured as a CNG-powered car. That's the Honda Civic GX, which boasts an EPA-estimated fuel economy of 24/36 miles per gasoline-gallon equivalent. AOL Autos: Best hybrids . Rich Kolodziej, president of Natural Gas Vehicles for America said there are other natural-gas-powered vehicles on the road -- about 130,000, he estimates -- but that the vast majority of those are part of commercial or transit fleets or have been converted from gasoline-powered cars. ""They're mostly fleet vehicles, like transit buses, delivery trucks, and the fleets maintained by the gas company, the electric company, etc,"" he said. ""We don't have hard figures about conversions, but I'd bet that about 25 percent of those 130,000 were once gasoline-powered vehicles that have been converted to CNG vehicles,"" Kolodziej said. ""There are a growing number of companies making certified conversion systems and installing them."" NGVAmerica maintains a list of certified conversion systems on its Web site: www.ngvc.org. AOL Autos: Fuel-efficient used cars . Some of those 130,000 are also natural-gas-powered vehicles manufactured and sold by Ford, Chrysler and GM back in the early '90s, he says -- back when the U.S. manufacturers were still in the business of making CNG-powered cars. But we'll get back to that later. But with the price of gasoline currently averaging over $4 a gallon nationally, Kolodziej predicts there will be more and more demand for CNG-powered vehicles like the Civic GX. ""I went to a conference a couple of months ago, and every manufacturer we talked to said that their phones were ringing off the hook, from people who are saying they'd be interested in buying a CNG-powered car,"" Kolodziej said. ""And there are more and more people and companies who want to get into the conversion business."" AOL Autos: Hybrid SUVs . The cost of conversions varies by the type of vehicle, Kolodziej noted. ""But most cost in the $10,000 range. Most conversion systems are certified for Ford and GM models, among others,"" he said. On the financial side, natural gas is about 30 percent less expensive than gasoline when it is purchased at a refueling station. It's about 50 percent less expensive when you fill 'er up at home, via home refueling appliance that tap into your natural gas line, Kolodziej said. Owners of the Honda Civic GX in New York and California who have natural gas piped into their homes can purchase the ""Phill"" re-fueling system for about $3,500. This Phill system can be used whether your CNG vehicle was manufactured that way or converted, he said. AOL Autos: Luxury cars with best gas mileage . ""The Phill is about the size of a pay phone, and you hang it on the garage wall, and vent it like a dryer and plug it into a gas line and also into an electric socket,"" Kolodziej explained. The primary environmental benefit of a CNG car is that it produces 90 percent fewer smog-forming pollutants (oxides of nitrogen), compared to the output of a conventional gas engine, said Steve Ellis, manager of alternative fuels for American Honda Motor Co. The Civic GX has reaped many environmental awards. This year, it was named by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) as the ""greenest vehicle in the nation -- for the fifth consecutive year."" The GX, which was first introduced in 1998, has the cleanest internal combustion certified by the EPA, Ellis noted. AOL Autos: Most-popular fuel-efficient cars . The Civic GX is not a high-volume vehicle in terms of sales. Ellis said annual sales have fluctuated between 500 to 1000 units a year since it was rolled out, with sales of 1,100 units last year. He expects that to go up in 2008. For comparison purposes, about 40,000 Honda Civic Hybrids were sold last year, with sales of 48,000 anticipated for this year. Most of the sales of the Civic GX are concentrated in southern California, followed by Phoenix and Salt Lake City -- primarily because those markets are where many of the 1,600 re-fueling stations are presently located. ""As the infrastructure builds up, we'll sell more of them in other markets,"" Ellis predicted. ""Right now, this is a car that people use regionally. If you live here in Los Angeles, you can drive to Las Vegas and back and not worry about being able to find a refueling station. As for cost, the GX natural-gas vehicle is priced at about $24,500, compared to $17,000 for a comparably-equipped Civic LX, Ellis said -- except that buyers get a $4,000 tax credit on the purchase of the GX. And until recently, California buyers got an additional $3,000 rebate from the California Air Resources Board. ""But the program was so popular, they are out of funds, and looking to add more money to the coffer so they can continue with the rebates,"" Ellis said. ""But people who buy a Civic GX, when we ask them about the math, in term of comparing those two Civics, they sort of give us blank stares,"" Ellis continued. ""Most of these folks who are buying the GX are trying to get out of having to commute to work every day in a pick-up truck, SUV or even a passenger car that's only getting 15 or 20 miles a gallon. And they're also the same kind of people who've said they'd pay $25 or $50 a week to be able to drive in the car-pool lane."" Interestingly, many of the automakers, like Volkswagen, Mercedes, Fiat, GM Opel, Ford Europe, Peugeot and Renault, do produce CNG-powered vehicles for other countries, said NGVAmerica's Kolodziej, who noted that ""about 1.5 million of the natural gas vehicles have been sold in Brazil, another 1.5 million in Argentina, another 1.5 million in Pakistan, and so on."" And, once upon a time, in the early '90s, U.S. automakers did sell CNG vehicles in the United States. ""But the federal government kept adding more loopholes to the energy policy that was supposed to encourage the increased manufacture and sales of CNG vehicles,"" Kolodziej said. ""Then the government opted not to expand the coverage of the program the way the law allowed -- or the way the automakers expected. Without that demand pull, the U.S. automakers didn't believe they could sell enough of them here."" ""U.S. automakers zigged when they probably should have zagged"" added Ellis of American Honda. ""They turned their backs on CNG and began to focus on bio-fuels."" But, noted Ellis, ""We're definitely keeping our stake in the CNG business, because we know we can add it to other platforms. We used to think of the Civic GX as 'The Little Engine That Could' -- you know, saying, 'I think I can, I think I can' in terms of becoming more commercially viable. ""But, with gas prices going up and up, now we're thinking more along the lines of 'I know I can, I know I can.' And more and more people are genuinely interested in going more green because of the environmental impact,"" he said. ""A lot of people got into the hybrids, and then, after a while, began to ask, 'How can I do more?' And they're looking to natural-gas-powered cars as the answer to that. ""So, we're in this for the long haul,"" noted Ellis, who said the company is definitely looking to do bigger business and make a profit from the GX. ""Now, it's just a matter of society continuing to change, and to continue to become more environmentally-minded. As they do, we think there will be increasing interest in CNG, and we'll see a shift in emphasis toward CNG and away from bio-fuels.""","Scientists trying to determine which alternative fuel is best for future .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- A mother and her teenage son are kidnapped. The kidnappers place a cell phone in the car of the boy's father so they can communicate their ransom demands. The son is burned with a blowtorch. The mother implores the father to pay the ransom. A terrifying scenario, but one that the FBI and police say was all orchestrated by the mother to get some fast cash from her ex-husband. The mother, Alejandra Arriaza, her boyfriend, Angel Ponce, and his nephew, Joel Boza, were charged Tuesday with federal kidnapping counts. If convicted, they could be sentenced to life in prison. According to an FBI affidavit, all three have admitted their roles in the phony kidnapping. ""We took it very seriously and believed a couple of lives were at risk,"" said Jim Leljedal of the Broward County, Florida, sheriff's office. ""And then to find out that one of the victims was involved in the plot was pretty surprising."" The three suspects will have a detention hearing Wednesday in a federal court in Miami, Florida. The U.S. attorney's office would not comment on the case. According to the FBI affidavit, written by special agent Scott Wilson, the plot was Arriaza's idea. It began, court papers say, when she and her boyfriend found out her ex-husband had recently come into some money from the sale of a business, and that he kept a large amount of cash in his home. The father and son are not named in the affidavit, which refers to the father as ""H.P."" and to his 17-year-old son as ""N.P."" The affidavit says that the plot began Thursday when Arriaza told her son she wanted to take him to Wal-Mart to purchase an Apple iPhone. When they got back to their car, a masked intruder appeared from the back seat, pointed a gun at the son's back and told him and his mother that they were being kidnapped, according to the affidavit. The kidnapper placed thick tape over the son's eyes and instructed his mother to drive to a mobile home in southwest Miami, where a second person, who introduced himself as ""El Negro,"" was waiting. The affidavit says the men forced N.P. to sit in a chair, where they bound his hands. His torso was bound to the back of the chair with shrink wrap, and his legs were bound with tape. The boy's head was wrapped in thick tape from the top to the tip of his nose, and he was put in a closet, where he spent the night. The next day, according to the FBI affidavit, the kidnappers called the boy's father on a cell phone they had placed in his car. The father then called authorities, who began to record the phone calls. At one point during the abduction, the son told the kidnappers that his father had about $50,000 in a bank, the affidavit says. When the kidnappers felt that the father was not complying with their demands, they threatened to burn his son, and at one point, according to the affidavit, ""the kidnappers put a lit blowtorch close to the phone, so he could hear it."" During another phone call, Arriaza, who is the father's ex-wife, told him that kidnappers were burning their son's feet. She implored him to pay the kidnappers their ransom, the affidavit says. At one point, Wilson wrote, the kidnappers held the blowtorch so close to N.P. ""that it burnt the hair off his leg."" ""I think they wanted to impress him with the seriousness so that he would relay ... to his father to come up with some money,"" Leljedal said. Under the FBI's guidance, the father arranged to pay the ransom. But late in the evening of April 10, before the ransom was paid, law enforcement located the mobile home and rescued the son, who immediately identified his mother's boyfriend, Angel Ponce, as one of the men inside the unit where he was being held. A search of the home turned up a fake gun, a blowtorch, tape and three cell phones. According to the affidavit, Ponce said Arriaza came up with the idea to have herself kidnapped, along with her son, to get money from her ex-husband. Arriaza later admitted her involvement in the kidnapping and said her son had no involvement in the ruse, according to the FBI. ""We don't think she meant to harm to her son. She just wanted to collect from her ex,"" Leljedal said. In the end, he said, it was all about one thing: ""The basic motive of greed.""","Woman, boyfriend, third man charged in bizarre fake kidnapping .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- After about 30 hours of deliberation, a jury on Monday convicted music producer Phil Spector of second-degree murder in the death of actress Lana Clarkson more than six years ago. Phil Spector will not remain free on bail pending his May 29 sentencing. Wearing a black suit with a red tie and pocket square, Spector showed no reaction as the verdict was announced. Now 69, he faces a sentence of 18 years to life in prison when he is sentenced May 29. Asked if he agreed to the sentencing date, Spector quietly answered, ""Yes."" Prosecutor Alan Jackson said he believed the jury reached the correct verdict, and he acknowledged the strength and backing of Clarkson's family. But defense attorney Doron Weinberg said Spector's defense team disagreed and planned to appeal. ""We don't believe justice was done,"" Weinberg said. Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler declined to allow Spector to remain free on bail pending sentencing, citing Spector's years-long ""pattern of violence"" involving firearms.  Watch the lawyers give their views of the verdict » . ""This was not an isolated incident,"" Fidler said, noting Spector's two previous firearm-related convictions from the 1970s. ""The taking of an innocent human life, it doesn't get any more serious than that."" Spector's wife, Rachelle, was in the courtroom to hear the verdict Monday, as was Clarkson's mother, Donna. Clarkson, 40, was found dead, slumped in a chair in the foyer of Spector's Alhambra, California, mansion with a gunshot wound through the roof of her mouth in February 2003. A mistrial was declared in Spector's first trial in September 2007. After deliberating 15 days, jurors told Fidler that they were unable to reach a verdict. Spector was also charged with second-degree murder in that trial. Jurors deadlocked 10-2 in favor of conviction. In closing arguments at the retrial, prosecutor Truc Do called Spector ""a very dangerous man"" who ""has a history of playing Russian roulette with women -- six women. Lana just happened to be the sixth."" Weinberg argued that the prosecution's case hinged on circumstantial evidence. He said the possibility that Clarkson committed suicide could not be ruled out. Do pointed out, however, to jurors that Clarkson bought new shoes on the day of her death -- something a suicidal woman would not have done, the prosecutor said. A female juror who declined to be identified told reporters the jurors considered all the evidence and testimony to reach their verdict. ""This entire jury took this so seriously,"" she said with tears in her eyes, before adding that ""it's tough to be in a jury,"" because another person's life is in the jury's hands. Clarkson starred in the 1985 B-movie ""Barbarian Queen"" and appeared in many other films, including ""DeathStalker,"" ""Blind Date,"" ""Scarface,"" ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" and the spoof ""Amazon Women on the Moon."" She was working as a VIP hostess at Hollywood's House of Blues at the time of her death. In the 2007 trial, Spector's attorneys argued that Clarkson was depressed over a recent breakup and grabbed a .38-caliber pistol to kill herself while at Spector's home. But prosecution witnesses painted Spector as a gun-toting menace. Five women took the stand and claimed he had threatened them with firearms. His driver testified that he heard a loud noise and saw the producer leave the home, pistol in hand, saying, ""I think I killed somebody."" Spector's retrial began in October. Fidler ruled that jurors could consider the lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter against Spector. Spector's professional trademark was the ""Wall of Sound,"" the layering of instrumental tracks and percussion that underpinned a string of hits on his Philles label -- named for Spector and his business partner, Lester Sill -- in the early 1960s. iReport.com: What do you think of this verdict? The roaring arrangements were the heart of what he called ""little symphonies for the kids"" -- among them No. 1 hits like the Ronettes' ""Be My Baby"" and the Righteous Brothers' ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'."" Spector co-produced the Beatles' final album, ""Let It Be,"" and worked with ex-Beatles George Harrison and John Lennon on solo projects after the group broke up. His recording of Harrison's 1971 benefit concert for war relief in Bangladesh won the 1972 Grammy award for album of the year. Spector has won two Grammy Awards and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989, but he stayed out of the public eye for two decades before his 2003 arrest in Clarkson's death.","NEW: Defense says it will appeal; ""We don't believe justice was done""

"(CNN) -- Rapid-fire TV news bulletins or getting updates via social-networking tools such as Twitter could numb our sense of morality and make us indifferent to human suffering, scientists say. Scientists say updates on networking tools such as Twitter are often to quick for the brain to fully digest. New findings show that the streams of information provided by social networking sites are too fast for the brain's ""moral compass"" to process and could harm young people's emotional development. Before the brain can fully digest the anguish and suffering of a story, it is being bombarded by the next news bulletin or the latest Twitter update, according to a University of Southern California study. ""If things are happening too fast, you may not ever fully experience emotions about other people's psychological states and that would have implications for your morality,"" said researcher Mary Helen Immordino-Yang. The report, published next week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Online Early Edition, studied how volunteers responded to real-life stories chosen to stimulate admiration for virtue or skill, or compassion for physical or social pain. iReport.com: Growing pains for Twitter, Facebook? Brain scans showed humans can process and respond very quickly to signs of physical pain in others, but took longer to show admiration of compassion. ""For some kinds of thought, especially moral decision-making about other people's social and psychological situations, we need to allow for adequate time and refection,"" said Immordio-Yang. She said the study raises questions about the emotional cost, particularly for young people, of heavy reliance on a torrent of news snippets delivered via TV and online feeds such as Twitter. She said: ""We need to understand how social experience shapes interactions between the body and mind, to produce citizens with a strong moral compass."" USC sociologist Manuel Castells said the study raised more concerns over fast-moving TV than the online environment. ""In a media culture in which violence and suffering becomes an endless show, be it in fiction or in infotainment, indifference to the vision of human suffering gradually sets in."" Research leader Antonio Damasio, director of USC's Brain and Creativity Institute, said the findings stressed the need for slower delivery of the news, and highlighted the importance of slow-burn emotions like admiration. Damasio cited the example of U.S. President Barack Obama, who says he was inspired by his father, to show how admiration can be key to cultural success. ""We actually separate the good from the bad in great part thanks to the feeling of admiration. It's a deep physiological reaction that's very important to define our humanity."" Twitter, which allows users to swap messages and links of 140-characters or less, says on its Web site that it sees itself as a solution to information overload, rather than a cause of it. This function, it says, ""means you can step in and out of the flow of information as it suits you and it never queues up with increasing demand of your attention.""","USC study says rapid-fire Twitter and news updates are too fast for brain .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Listen closely and you'll hear squeals of disgust from a watchdog group tracking congressional pork in the nation's capital. Research on swine odor is one of the projects listed in the ""Pig Book,"" released Tuesday. Citizens Against Government Waste is out with its annual ""Pig Book"" -- a list of lawmakers whom the group considers the most egregious porkers, members of the House and Senate who use the earmarking process to funnel money to projects on their home turf. Fittingly perhaps, the list includes nearly $1.8 million for swine odor and manure management research in Iowa. ""In fiscal year 2009, Congress stuffed 10,160 projects into the 12 appropriations bills worth $19.6 billion,"" the group said in a report released Tuesday. The amount marks a 14 percent increase over 2008. The ""Pig Book"" also names dozens of what it considers the most blatant examples of pork-barrel spending.  See a list of those projects »  ""Taxpayers are ready to revolt,"" said Tom Schatz, the organization's president. ""Despite repeated claims by members of Congress that earmarks have been reduced, the Pig Book belies that claim."" Included in the funding is $3.8 million for the Old Tiger Stadium Conservancy -- a group dedicated to finding a new use for the stadium that the Detroit Tigers baseball team played in from 1896 through 1999. An additional $1.9 million went to the Pleasure Beach water taxi service project in Bridgeport, Connecticut, requested by then-Rep. Chris Shays. A bridge fire more than a decade ago means beach-goers have to travel a couple of extra miles to get to the beach. Alaska led the nation in pork per capita, at $322 a person. At the bottom of the list was Arizona, with less than $12 per resident. Sen. John McCain does not request earmarks for his home state.  See where each state ranks » . Mississippi Sen. Thad Cochran, the ranking Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee, topped the list of senators receiving earmarks, with a total of $653 million. The chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, was second, with $445 million. Hawaii Reps. Neil Abercrombie and Mazie Hirono, both Democrats, topped the list for earmarks in the House of Representatives. Abercrombie's pet projects received a total of almost $257 million; Hirono's received almost $153 million. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, was granted the organization's so-called ""Porkasaurus"" award for earmarking $143,000 for the Las Vegas Natural History Museum. ""Sen. Reid is fond of saying that earmarks have been around since we were a country. Now he must be blaming it on the dinosaurs,"" Schatz said. Some recipients of the earmarks disagreed with the characterization of their projects as ""pork."" Kathleen Wendler, a member of the Old Tiger Stadium Conservancy's board of directors, argued that the $3.8 million dedicated to the old ballpark was critical to revitalizing the surrounding Detroit neighborhood. The money ""is not pork at all,"" she said. The ballpark, if properly utilized, can be an ""economic development generator for the local business district. This project will help draw younger people into the neighborhood. It will help save the neighborhood in the long run."" To qualify for the ""Pig Book,"" a project must meet at least one of these standards: It was requested by only one chamber of Congress; was not specifically authorized; was not competitively awarded; was not requested by the president; greatly exceeded the president's budget request or the previous year's funding; was not the subject of congressional hearings; or served only a local or special interest. -- CNN's Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","NEW: Senate Appropriations Committee leaders from both parties top earmarks list .

"Editor's note: Annette Gordon-Reed won the 2008 National Book Award for ""The Hemingses of Monticello: An American Family."" A law professor at New York Law School and a history professor at Rutgers University, she will speak at the dedication of a new visitors center Wednesday at Monticello. Annette Gordon-Reed says Thomas Jefferson's ideals have been a powerful force in American life. (CNN) -- Does the legacy of Thomas Jefferson speak to Americans today? Or perhaps we should ask about Jefferson's legacies, for there are many. His fingerprints are everywhere. Politics, government, race, slavery -- our third president's life and words touch on so many aspects of the nation's journey from rebellious colony to world superpower that it is impossible to understand the country's history without dealing with him in some fashion. Even today, Jefferson's name is regularly invoked in the news -- the latest example being writers harking back to the forceful action he took against the Barbary pirates 200 years ago. His soaring language in the Declaration of Independence -- ""all men are created equal"" and pronouncement of the right to ""life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness"" -- galvanized many during his lifetime. Those words have resonated across the years with diverse groups of Americans seeking to gain full citizenship in the United States. Working-class whites, blacks, women, immigrants, gays -- all have turned to the Declaration as a form of promise, a credo for the nation to live up to. It is particularly interesting to ponder Jefferson's legacies at this moment in American history. The election of the country's first African-American president has brought an intense focus on America's past, specifically the history of relations between the races. Again, it is not possible to consider that history in any serious way without thinking of Jefferson. The great and often remarked-upon paradox is that the man who wrote about the equality of all mankind, and who wrote insightfully and forcefully about the evils of slavery, was also a lifelong slave owner in a racially based slave system. He was not alone in this, of course. Some of the most prominent founders -- including four of the first five presidents -- owned slaves, too. All these men, at various points in their lives, claimed to abhor the institution that provided their sustenance. Jefferson tends to be held to a higher standard on this question largely because he, not George Washington, James Madison or James Monroe, wrote the Declaration of Independence. And, as hard as it may be for some to believe now, he early on developed a reputation as a dangerous radical. There was his attitude toward religion. Jefferson did not believe in the divinity of Jesus Christ and, to the consternation of many, insisted upon the separation of church and state. There is no doubt that he would enthusiastically endorse President Obama's statement on his recent trip to Turkey that ""one of the great strengths of the United States"" is that it does not consider itself ""a Christian nation or a Jewish nation or a Muslim nation. We consider ourselves a nation of citizens who are bound by ideals and a set of values."" And, of course, there was his politics. Jefferson was, in the eyes of many, a ""leveler"" bent on destroying all social distinctions; a move that his detractors felt would eventually lead to the breakdown of racial barriers. Indeed, during the period leading up to the American Civil War, later generations of white Southerners emphatically repudiated Jefferson's Declaration and, in some cases, the man himself. They knew that whether he truly believed those words or not, the ideas embodied in the Declaration mattered greatly. The logic of Jefferson's words, the conclusions that one could draw from them, could not be contained. They would transcend their original context and find meaning for generations of Americans yet unborn. Those who feared that outcome -- and those who welcomed it -- were right: Jefferson's words have made a profound difference. Then there is Jefferson's life, more specifically the place where he lived it: Monticello, the image on the back of the American nickel. Each year, thousands of people from all over the world make the trip up the 867-foot little mountain to visit a place that was home not only to Jefferson, but to hundreds of enslaved blacks who labored in his fields, plantation industries and house. Indeed, enslaved men and teenage girls shaved off the top of the mountain, digging with their hands and shovels to level the ground to make it ready for Jefferson's architectural masterpiece. And then, other enslaved people helped build the house and maintained it over the years. Tangled bloodlines are also a part of the Monticello story. Jefferson's wife, Martha, brought to the mountain the six children her father, John Wayles, had with an enslaved woman named Elizabeth Hemings. Later, long after Martha's death, one of those children, Sarah (Sally) Hemings, would have children with Jefferson, playing out a common scenario in the plantation South. Many enslaved families lived at Monticello for generations; some spending far more actual time on the land than Jefferson or any member of his legal white family. Take Betty Brown, a Hemings, though not a child of John Wayles. She came to the mountain in 1772 as the 15-year-old personal maid to Martha. She was, probably, the last person to leave the place, residing there into the 1830s, long after Jefferson's death and long after his property, including human beings, had been sold to pay the enormous debts on his estate. So Monticello, perhaps the most well-known slave plantation in the world, stands as one of Jefferson's most important and enduring legacies. It is more than just a white family's legal residence, a place of arresting beauty. It is a site where some of the most compelling and tragic dramas of American history were played out. Slavery in all its aspects -- forced labor, separated families, the whip, the owners and the owned linked together by slavery's law and by blood -- can be found there. For many Americans -- most importantly the numerous school children on field trips -- Monticello has been, and will be, their only firsthand experience of an American slave plantation. For that reason, as we have grown and matured as a nation, it has become a place not only to celebrate the contributions and genius of one man -- although there is that, and rightly so. It is a place to learn much and to think hard and intelligently about America's past -- the awe-inspiring and the awful -- a vista from which to contemplate and prepare for America's future made possible, in part, by Jefferson's vision. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Annette Gordon-Reed.","Annette Gordon-Reed: Thomas Jefferson still relevant today .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- If you're a comedy fan, you've probably heard of him by now. Comedian Brian Regan, 50, is famous for his clean jokes about everyday life. He is on tour. Famous for his clean jokes about everyday life, comedian Brian Regan is at the peak of his career, gaining new followers with every performance. On a recent Saturday night, he dazzled a sold-out audience of more than 2,000 people near Atlanta as part of his 2009 comedy tour. The easygoing 50-year-old comedian with a boyish smile and energetic presence pranced back and forth across the stage Saturday telling jokes that brought laughter to issues both serious and silly -- from the stressful economy to the quirks of text messaging. Regan, a Miami, Florida, native, has been performing stand-up comedy since 1980 by starting at small venues and comedy clubs. His breakthrough came in the late 1990s after the release of his album ""Brian Regan Live,"" which sold 150,000 copies despite the comedian's relative obscurity at the time. The album featured simple routines that made fun of childhood memories such as Little League baseball games and seat belts. His witty, clean style of humor on the album, which resonated with a wide audience from college kids to grandmothers, catapulted him to success. Since then, he has gone on to release three DVDs. Punchline Magazine, a comedy publication, named Regan's most recent DVD, ""The Epitome of Hyperbole,"" one of the top five comedy DVDs of 2008. Nowadays, he routinely appears on television, including specials on Comedy Central and slots on the ""Late Show With David Letterman."" His tour this year will visit more than 80 cities, nearly twice as many as four years ago. CNN.com sat down with Regan to learn more about his brand of comedy and what's in store for the future. CNN: How did you become interested in comedy and stand-up? Brian Regan: This isn't the main reason, but when I was in college [Heidelberg College in Ohio], my name was Rip for Rip van Winkle. I had a 7 a.m. class, and I missed it almost every day. I would wake up and run across campus. I remember thinking, ""What's going to happen if I don't wake up for things?"" And then a comedian performed at our college, and I went to the show, and I noticed the show started at 8 p.m. and I was like, well, the hours are good. I can handle a job that starts at 8 p.m. CNN: Who are some of your influences? Regan: I love Steve Martin. He took silliness to a level of brilliance, I think. CNN: How do you get your ideas? Regan: I used to try and sit down with a blank piece of paper. I would stare at the paper, and it just continues to stay blank. I've learned that for me, it's easier for me to go out and live my life and do my thing. CNN: You don't really use the crass language many comedians rely on. Is there a reason for that? Regan: I don't really know those words [laughing]. I used to have a few jokes here and there with a four-letter word in it. I was always 90 to 95 percent clean with my jokes anyways, and I'm kind of anal so, why be 95 percent something when you could be 100 percent something? It worked out, and people really seem to respond to it so I guess that other 5 percent wasn't that important anyways. CNN: Do you try to incorporate the economy into your jokes? Regan: I do a few jokes about the economy but from an everyday person perspective. People like to laugh, and they especially like to laugh during difficult circumstances. One of the best shows in New York I had was the week after 9/11. I was surprised this comedy club was even going to have a show. They said people were looking for a diversion. I went up and said I'm not trying to make light of what happened, I'm just trying to forget about it for an hour. I find it's similar to what is happening with the economy. Obviously, it's not as serious as 9/11, but people are looking for an escape. I think people want to laugh. CNN: How can comedy help people through tough times? Regan: I think comedy is a good way to deal with anything. I hear about people in the hospital who are ill, and they use humor to help them through it. I think it's a great remedy for many things. They say a formula for comedy is comedy equals tragedy plus time. A difficult or uncomfortable situation takes place, and then you laugh about it later down the road. Sometimes I wonder if I could be so mentally healthy to subtract the time part. Like what if there is a flat tire, and it's raining outside? Instead of laughing a month later, why not laugh while you are changing tires in the rain? CNN: Your fan base has really grown in the last five years. How does the fame feel? Regan: It's been a slow gradual thing for me. I've never had a single event or television show that did it. I just pick up a couple more fans and a few more fans, and before you know it, it's like hey man, things are going OK. CNN: What's in store for the future? Regan: This is what I like doing, and I will hopefully do it forever. If something else comes along, I'd be open to that. CNN: What about a television show? Regan: I'm not really interested in being an actor. But I would like to get on a television show that would capture my comedy and in that role do a little acting. I'd like to do something that has to do with my comedy.","Brian Regan has become a top-ranked comedian by keeping material clean .

"(CNN) -- Penny Ireland's family is so scattered around the world that Facebook, the popular social networking site, has become the family's No. 1 way to communicate. The fastest-growing age group on Facebook is women older than 55, Inside Facebook says. ""We call it our living room,"" the 56-year-old mother said by phone from her home in Houston, Texas. ""Everybody can tell what everybody else is doing."" ""Everybody"" includes Ireland's five kids and her 83-year-old mother, who has a Facebook profile she accesses daily, Ireland said. While online social networks like Facebook, Twitter and MySpace are known hang-outs for younger adults and teenagers, older generations in recent months have been taking to the medium at a faster rate than any other age group, according to industry reports. Many of these older folks use social networks to keep tabs on younger family members and they often find fruitful connections with their peers after they've friended all of their kids and grandkids, according to an informal survey by Stanford University professor BJ Fogg. Join a conversation on this topic at CNN's Facebook page . The trend is still relatively confined. Only about 7 percent of people older than 65 have online social-networking profiles, according to research from the Pew Internet & American Life Project. But Facebook's popularity is growing most quickly among women older than 55, according to a site called Inside Facebook, which tracks Facebook's growth. There are now about 1.5 million female users older than 55 on the site, the group says -- roughly a 550 percent increase over six months ago. By comparison, membership among people younger than 25 grew by less than 20 percent over the same period, Inside Facebook says. Facebook now says it has 200 million users, making its user base larger than the populations of all the world's countries except China, India, the United States and Indonesia. Such a vast presence, coupled with news media buzz about all social media, has pushed online social networking to a ""tipping point,"" said Amanda Lenhart, a senior research specialist at the Pew Internet & American Life Project. Fogg, the Stanford instructor, said the trend has spread outward from college towns, where Facebook was first adopted, and inward from the American coasts. Facebook today has a global presence, with 70 percent of users living outside the U.S., the site says. ""We've reached critical mass where there's been enough talk about Facebook and people have gotten so many invitations from their friends, they're going, 'OK, what is this Facebook thing? I've got to get onboard or I'm going to be left in the dust,' "" Fogg said. Parents who are interested in their kids' online activities contribute to the sharp increase in older users on Facebook, said Linda Fogg-Phillips, a 49-year-old who, with her brother, co-taught a six-week class at Stanford called ""Facebook for Parents."" ""Parents are finally at the point where they realize this is not going away. They better figure out how to get on it and they'd better figure out how to use it,"" said Fogg-Phillips, who is a mother of eight in Las Vegas, Nevada. ""It's a snowball effect. It's viral in a good sense."" Older people often must overcome fears about privacy issues before they will join Facebook, Fogg-Phillips said. Once they do, they often find unexpected uses for the network, she said. iReport.com: Facebook, Twitter growing pains? That was the case for Craig Costa, a 55-year-old fly-fishing guide in Park City, Utah, who said family members forced him to join Facebook. Costa still finds parts of the site annoying, and isn't comfortable having his personal information made public, but he has connected with old friends he wouldn't have otherwise -- including his ex-wife, who now is a Facebook friend of his current wife. ""It's been really interesting because so many people have a connection to me,"" he said. ""I was married before and my wife is now talking to my ex-wife. And some of her old friends are telling old stories about me to my wife. It's just bizarre for me."" Costa said he also can more easily keep up with his 28-year-old son, who lives in New York and also keeps a Facebook page for his dog. Karen Essman, 61, uses Facebook but said she has trouble convincing her peers to join social-networking sites. They often don't understand the interface or are afraid of scams, she said. ""It's a little bit more difficult for older people,"" she said. Margaret Brooks, 63, of Idaho Falls, Idaho, joined the site because there was no other place for her to see her 18-year-old grandson's artwork. She asked to be his friend online, and at first she worried he wouldn't respond. ""I did think, 'Oh my goodness, I'm old grandma. He doesn't want to have anything to do with grandma on Facebook,' "" she said. ""But he did, and every time I send something to him he sends something to me."" Joanne Woeppel joined Facebook so she could keep tabs on her 13 grandkids. But the Web site also has helped the 71-year-old keep up with other people without changing her routine. ""I'm pretty much what you would call a loner. I'm content in my own company. I can find things to do to entertain myself that I don't need to be out and about,"" she said by phone from her three-bedroom house near Dallas, Texas. ""I don't go out to socialize."" A former call center worker and aspiring sci-fi author, Woeppel visits the online social network about once a day. Spending time on Facebook, which she joined in September, helps her feel connected to family all over the country -- especially to the youngsters, she said. She has family members who live nearby, but says she's found a way to communicate with them in their own language through Facebook. ""Let's face it, kids that age aren't really interested in talking to people my age very much. It's more, 'Hi grandma how are ya? ... Bye!' "" she said with a laugh. ""That's basically what I get from my grandkids, so if I can engage them through just a little bit of chit-chat [online], it's a lot more than I can get over the phone.""","Women older than 55 make up the fastest-growing age group on Facebook .

"MANAMA, Bahrain (CNN) -- Efforts to protect ships from pirates in the waters off Somalia's east coast face a tremendous challenge: The vastness of the area makes it difficult to get to ships that are in danger. The crew of the Maersk Alabama talked with media after the ship docked in Mombasa, Kenya. ""To put it in perspective, draw a box from Houston to Chicago to New York City down to Jacksonville, Florida. It's an immense body of water,"" U.S. Navy Vice Adm. Bill Gortney told reporters Sunday. When the Maersk Alabama, a U.S.-flagged cargo ship, reported an attempted attack by pirates the day before the pirates successful attempt on Wednesday, ""our closest vessel from all the navies that were out there -- we have 16 navies that are patrolling those waters -- and the closest one was the USS Bainbridge, and it was over 300 nautical miles,"" Gortney said. The next day, when the Maersk company reported pirates had boarded its ship, ""we were closing Bainbridge as quickly as we [could], but 22 knots, 300 miles, it takes a while to get there.""  View a timeline of the attack and its aftermath » . He added, ""There's about a 10-minute window from when the pirates are able to get onboard that we have time to act."" Things are different on the north side of Somalia, in the Gulf of Aden, where many piracy incidents have taken place. That area is ""a little bit more concentrated,"" Gortney said, speaking from Bahrain. ""We've had more successful attempts"" at breaking up piracy efforts in that region, he said. ""But out on the east coast of Somalia, such a vast area, we simply do not have enough resources in order to cover all those areas."" Gortney spoke to reporters by telephone Sunday after Navy snipers shot and killed three pirates who had held Maersk Alabama Capt. Richard Phillips hostage since Wednesday. Phillips was freed by the U.S. Navy uninjured.  Watch how U.S. forces believed Phillips was in danger » . Phillips graduated from the Massachusetts Maritime Academy, which trains mariners on the dangers of piracy, the president of the academy said. ""The sea is a dangerous place -- pirates [are] just one of the many dangers,"" Adm. Rick Gurnon of the academy told reporters after the rescue. The academy ""tries to educate you and prepare you to keep you from danger, but it doesn't always work."" He noted that while Phillips' story had a happy ending, more than 200 mariners remain captives at sea, and called on the international community to beef up security in the waters by arming crews, increasing warships and reducing the ability of Somalis to obtain ships from coastal safehavens. ""It will certainly take hard work and money and focus,"" he said, ""but we've got to stop it or we begin to risk lives in areas of the world that are vital for national security."" Chris Voss, former FBI international kidnapping negotiator, told CNN that the pirates from the impoverished, war-torn nation need an alternative way to make money. ""Unfortunately, they found themselves in a position where they could start piracy in the region and it's become a virus,"" Voss told CNN. ""It's easy money ... and once it gets into a culture, it's very difficult to get out, and the only way to get it out is attack on multiple levels."" Asked whether he was concerned that this incident, including the deaths of three of the four pirates involved in the hijacking of the Maersk Alabama and the kidnapping of Phillips, could escalate violence in the region, Gortney responded, ""Yes ... This could escalate violence in this part of the world. No question about it."" But some experts believe the rescue may help set a tone that will eventually deter piracy in the region. ""This one incident, if it is the only time that we take this robust action, will not deter,"" retired U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt told CNN. ""But this incident, the next incident, the next incident after that -- a long term pattern will certainly have a deterrent effect against piracy.""","U.S. Navy Vice Adm.

Patrons at the cafe managed to capture the shooter, a 45-year-old man, and hold him until police arrived, Rotterdam Police spokesman Gerde Jung told CNN. Police arrested the man and recovered his weapon, Jung said. The shooting was probably the the result of a quarrel the man had earlier, but details of that argument were unclear, Jung said.

"(CNN)  -- A roadside bomb in southern Afghanistan killed a female Canadian soldier and wounded four other troops, the Canadian military said Tuesday. Trooper Karine Blais, 21, is the second Canadian female soldier to die in Afghanistan. Trooper Karine Blais was killed Monday when the troops' armored vehicle struck the bomb. The attack occurred north of Kandahar in the Shah Wali Kowt District of Kandahar province. Blais' death was the 117th Canadian troop fatality in the Afghan war, and she is the second Canadian female soldier killed in Afghanistan. The first, Capt. Nichola Goddard, was killed in a May 2006 firefight with insurgents in Kandahar province, where Canadian troops have been based during the conflict. Brig. Gen. Jonathan Vance, commander of Canadian troops in Afghanistan, called the 21-year-old Blais ""an energetic soldier who gave 100 percent to every challenge she faced using a unique sense of humor based on her honesty and frankness."" Vance said Blais ""demonstrated the qualities of a future leader"" and was ""respected by all members of her squadron."" ""Our thoughts are with the friends and family of our fallen comrade during this difficult time,"" the Canadian Forces said in a news release. ""All members of Task Force Kandahar are thinking of the family and friends of our fallen comrades during this sad time. We will not forget their sacrifice as we continue to bring security and hope to the people of Kandahar province."" Blais, from the 12th Canadian Armored Regiment at Valcartier, Quebec, near Quebec City, was serving with the 2nd Battalion, Royal 22th Regiment Battle Group. A chopper evacuated the four other troops to a medical facility at Kandahar airfield.

"(CNN) -- The declaration of a state of emergency in Thailand following violent clashes between anti-government and security forces marks the latest escalation in a long-running political crisis which has plunged the southeast Asian country into frequent bouts of disorder and instability. The scene from the streets of Bangkok on Monday showed widespread protests against the government. This weekend's protests, which included forcing the postponement of a summit of Asian leaders in the southern coastal city of Pattaya and demonstrations on the streets of Bangkok, were orchestrated by red-shirted supporters of the controversial and corruption-tainted former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Thaksin -- a multibillionaire media tycoon elected in 2001 on a populist platform that promised universal healthcare and cash handouts to poor villagers -- was ousted from power in a bloodless army coup in 2006 and has been in exile abroad since being sentenced last October to two years in prison after being convicted of a corruption charge by Thailand's Supreme Court. But Thaksin remains a polarizing figure in Thailand, commanding substantial support in the countryside. Until last year, Thaksin's allies had remained in power with the government headed by the exiled prime minister's brother-in law, Somchai Wongsawat, despite disruptive protests by the opposition People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD), whose supporters dressed in yellow and represented Thailand's traditional ruling class, suspicious of Thaksin's populist model of democracy. But the PAD achieved its goal of ousting Somchai in December after a week-long occupation of the prime ministerial Government House offices and blockading Bangkok's main airports, stranding thousands of tourists. Thailand's Constitutional Court subsequently disbanded Somchai's People Power Party for electoral fraud and barred Somchai from office for five years, paving the way for Thai lawmakers to elect opposition leader Abhisit Vejjajiva as prime minister. iReport.com: ""Red shirts"" take to streets . But Thaksin's supporters insist that Abhisit was not democratically elected and have vowed to protest until fresh elections are held. On Sunday, Thaksin told protesters via a video link from an unknown location that he would return home to lead them in a march on the capital if necessary. ""Now that they have tanks on the street and the soldiers are coming out, so it is time for the people to come out for a revolution,"" Thaksin said. Writing in a blog, CNN's Bangkok Correspondent Dan Rivers said he saw five possible scenarios emerging from the current crisis. Firstly, Abhisit could call a snap election, which he would be unlikely to win because Thaksin's allies continue to lead polls. Secondly, he could resign, resulting in the creation of another coalition which would struggle to unify the rival factions, leaving open the likelihood of further protests from one side or the other. Thirdly, Thaksin could return from exile to lead a red-shirted uprising; a scenario which Rivers describes as ""messy and bloody."" iReport.com: ""Numerous buses set ablaze"" Fourthly, the army could again intervene, as it has done in the past, although Rivers says that would do little to heal the deep divisions between both sides. Finally, Rivers said, Abhisit could choose to ride out the protests or ""get tough."" But both strategies would likely damage his standing. ""Trying to ignore the protests will leave him looking even weaker; ordering a violent crack-down may simply harden the resolve of the red shirts and provide fodder to their questionable claims that Abhisit has dictatorial tendencies,"" Rivers said.","Thai state of emergency is latest episode in ongoing political crisis .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Male singers regularly photographed wearing a hat are usually covering up a receding hairline. Jason Aldean has had six Top 10 country singles. His new album, ""Wide Open,"" is just out. But not Jason Aldean. He has a full head of hair, and wears a cowboy hat to signify his commitment to country music. The same is true for his well-fitting jeans and cowboy boots. It's a formula that seems to be working. The 32-year-old rising star has just notched his sixth Top 10 country single with ""She's Country,"" the lead track off his third CD, ""Wide Open"" (Broken Bow). We caught up with the Georgia native in his dressing room before a recent sold-out show at the House of Blues in Los Angeles, California. The following is an edited version of the interview. Jason Aldean: Definitely a cowboy hat in L.A. makes you stand out a little bit. CNN: It's a fashion statement in L.A. Aldean: It is! You've got to wear it with confidence, too.  Watch Aldean talk about his new album » . CNN: Are you nervous about your new album? Aldean: I wouldn't say I'm nervous. If you have an album that you're kind of on the fence about, then yeah, you would be kind of a little nervous. CNN: Have you ever had one of those -- or if you had, would you admit it? Aldean: When we went in to record the second album (2007's ""Relentless,"" which went gold), I think it was a good album, but I felt like I was under a lot of pressure recording that album -- more than the other two. You hear people talking about the sophomore slump and all that stuff, and so I think all that stuff sort of got to me after a while. Combined with being on the road 200 to 250 days [a year], I just didn't have that much fun recording it. I was exhausted. And so going into this third album, I just feel like mentally, I was back in the right place. CNN: As an artist, do you ever really think you got it right? Aldean: If at any point you're recording an album and you think it's the greatest thing that you've ever done, and you'll never be able to top it, then you should probably quit. Michael Jackson -- he made ""Thriller,"" so I can see why he might have said, ""I'm done."" But even he kept making records. CNN: Were you a Michael Jackson fan growing up? Did you moonwalk as a kid? Aldean: Of course! I had my glove and everything. Used to wet my hair so it looked like a Jheri curl. (Cracks up) CNN: Who else did you listen to as a kid? Aldean: Guns N' Roses -- the '80s rock stuff. Then I was into John Mellencamp, and Bob Seger and a lot of the Southern rock stuff -- the Allman Brothers, Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Marshall Tucker Band. I listened to a lot of different kinds of music. CNN: Are you finding that the economy has affected ticket sales? Is it harder to sell out shows these days? Aldean: I think everybody has kind of seen a little bit of a hit. We're no different. We've tried to make it more affordable for people to come to a show with lower ticket prices [most of the time in the $20-40 range]. Maybe go in and play a show for less money than we would normally go in to play a show for, just so people can afford to come out and buy a ticket. I mean, you're looking at 200 bucks if you've got a wife and two kids -- and then by the time you come there and buy a couple of T-shirts, or some drinks or whatever, you're spending three, four hundred dollars, and right now, people are a little hesitant to do that. CNN: What do you consider an expensive ticket? Aldean: If Elvis was still around, I don't know if I'd pay 80 bucks to go see him. I surely would not pay 80 bucks to go see me! CNN: From a financial standpoint, touring is more important to an artist than selling records these days. Aldean: The music industry is so different now than it was even when I hit the scene in 2005. If you go to Wal-Mart and you want a song, you've got to buy the whole album for ten bucks -- or you can go to iTunes, and if you want a song, you can pay a dollar to get it. So in return, the record label is going to make less money, which is us making less money to pay them back. The way it works is the record label basically fronts the money for us to record an album. As the money comes back in off of that, they take that and repay the debt that we owe them. So if they're not making enough to repay that debt, they're not going to keep us employed on the label for very long. CNN: As an artist, do you worry about that? Aldean: Oh, absolutely. I think every artist worries about that. As a consumer, I think iTunes is a great thing. As an entertainer, not so much. I would much rather have somebody buy an album as a whole. Bad thing about purchasing singles -- if you have an artist you like and you keep doing that, there's not going to be music enough for you to go and get, because they're not going to have a deal anymore. But who knows? Record labels may one day be out all together, and people may be making their own music and selling it on their Web sites. CNN: That seems to benefit established artists more than up-and-coming ones. Aldean: Radio's really accepted us, and proven that they're really going to play my stuff as long as I give them something good to play. Fans are coming out to the show, so I mean what more could I ask for? My original plan when I got started in this deal was just to be able to make a good living for my family and play music. I've been able to do that, which is all I've ever wanted.","Jason Aldean riding high with new hit, ""She's Country""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The National Transportation Safety Board began four days of hearings Tuesday on how to stem the ""drastic increase"" in medical helicopter accidents. Smoke rises from Spectrum Health Butterworth Hospital in Grand Rapids, Michigan, after a helicopter crash in May. Over a recent 12-month period, the board probed nine fatal medical helicopter accidents that killed 35 people, a development that one board member called ""alarming."" Medical helicopters ""provide an important service to the public"" in swiftly transporting ill and injured patients and donor organs, the board said on its Web site. Chopper pilots must operate ""safely and quickly"" in bad weather, at night or on ""unfamiliar landing sites,"" the board added. ""This hearing will be extremely important because it can provide an opportunity to learn more about the industry so that possibly we can make further recommendations that can prevent these accidents and save lives,"" said Robert Sumwalt, chairman of the hearing's board of inquiry.  Watch Sumwalt's remarks at hearing » . Flying at night in poor weather conditions likely contributed to the crashes in Texas and Alaska of three medical helicopters that killed 11 people, the NTSB said. The three crashes occurred near South Padre Island, Texas, in February 2008; Huntsville, Texas, in June; and Whittier, Alaska, in December 2007. iReport: Watch smoke pour from a medical chopper crash in Michigan . A December 2007 accident in Cherokee, Alabama, was likely caused by the pilot flying too low over trees, the NTSB said. The helicopter was shining a searchlight on a hunter who had been lost as rescue personnel on the ground tried to reach him. The pilot, a paramedic and a flight nurse were killed, the NTSB said. Among the issues to be discussed at the hearing will be flight operations, aircraft safety equipment, training and oversight. Expert witnesses such as pilots, medical personnel, managers and Federal Aviation Administration officials will give sworn testimony on what has been an ""ongoing concern"" of the safety board, which issued a report on emergency medical services operations in 2006. The NTSB said there were 55 EMS-related aviation accidents -- both fatal and nonfatal -- between January 2002 and January 2005 that could have been prevented with ""simple corrective actions."" In those crashes, 54 people were killed, and 18 were seriously injured, the NTSB said. The agency recommended to the FAA in January 2006 that all medical chopper operators be required to develop and implement risk evaluation programs, use dispatch and flight procedures that include up-to-date weather information, and install ""terrain awareness and warning systems"" on their aircraft. A fourth recommendation would require medical flight operators to follow federal regulations regarding their flights. The recommendations have not been fully implemented, the NTSB said.","Transportation safety board beginning four days of hearings .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Firefighters will need at least until midweek to get control of wildfires that have destroyed more than 900 homes and other structures in Southern California, a Los Angeles County Fire Department spokesman says. High winds have fanned blazes from Santa Barbara to Anaheim since Thursday, scorching an estimated 40,900 acres of land. Sustained winds eased Monday, but locally gusty conditions and humidity in the single-digit range could continue into Tuesday, the National Weather Service predicted. ""If we were being very optimistic, we would be looking at the middle of the week,"" Los Angeles County fire Capt. Dennis Cross said. ""If the weather forecast holds and we continue to get the great work being done in the last 24 hours, we're hoping midweek."" The most extensive losses have been in the Oakridge Mobile Home Park in the Sylmar district of Los Angeles, where winds clocked as high as 70 mph drove a wall of flames across the hillsides and destroyed nearly 500 of the park's 608 mobile homes on Saturday. iReport.com: Map shows fire's devastation . A two-day search that ended Monday found no human remains amid the scorched wreckage, authorities said.

"(CNN)  -- The head of the U.N. Children's Fund has expressed concern over a Saudi judge's refusal for a second time to annul a marriage between an 8-year-old girl and a 47-year-old man. UNICEF's Ann Veneman said consent cannot be free if either party is too young to make an informed decision. ""Irrespective of circumstances or the legal framework, the marriage of a child is a violation of that child's rights,"" said Ann Veneman, executive director of UNICEF. ""The right to free and full consent to marriage is recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Consent cannot be free and full when either party to a marriage is too young to make an informed decision."" The most recent ruling, in which the judge upheld his original verdict, was handed down Saturday in the Saudi city of Onaiza, where late last year the same judge rejected a petition from the girl's mother, seeking a divorce for her daughter. Have your say by clicking here . A relative said the judge, Sheikh Habib al-Habib, ""stuck by his earlier verdict and insisted that the girl could petition the court for a divorce once she reached puberty."" The family member, who requested anonymity, added that the mother will continue to pursue a divorce for her daughter. The case, which has drawn criticism from local and international rights groups, came to light in December when al-Habib declined to annul the marriage on a legal technicality. The judge ruled that the girl's mother -- who is separated from her father -- was not the girl's legal guardian and therefore could not represent her in court, Abdullah al-Jutaili, the mother's attorney, told CNN at the time. The girl's father, according to the lawyer, arranged the marriage in order to settle his debts with the man, who is a close friend of his. At the time of the initial verdict, the judge required the girl's husband to sign a pledge that he would not have sex with her until she reaches puberty, al-Jutaili told CNN. The judge ruled that when the girl reaches puberty, she will have the right to request a divorce by filing a petition with the court, the lawyer said. Last month, an appeals court in the Saudi capital of Riyadh declined to certify the original ruling, in essence rejecting al-Habib's verdict, and sent the case back to him for reconsideration. Under the complicated Saudi legal process, the appeals court ruling meant that the marriage was still in effect, but that a challenge to the marriage was still ongoing. The appeals court in Riyadh will now take up the case again and a hearing is scheduled for next month, according to the relative. The issue of child marriage has been a hot-button topic in the deeply conservative kingdom recently. While rights groups have petitioned the government for laws to protect children from such marriages, the kingdom's top cleric has said that it's OK for girls as young as 10 to wed. ""It is incorrect to say that it's not permitted to marry off girls who are 15 and younger,"" Sheikh Abdul Aziz Al-Sheikh, the kingdom's grand mufti, said in remarks last January, according to the regional Al-Hayat newspaper. ""A girl aged 10 or 12 can be married. Those who think she's too young are wrong, and they are being unfair to her."" Al-Sheikh reportedly made the remarks when he was asked during a lecture about parents forcing their underage daughters to marry. ""We hear a lot in the media about the marriage of underage girls,"" he said, according to the newspaper. ""We should know that sharia law has not brought injustice to women."" Sharia law is Islamic law. Saudi Arabia follows a strict interpretation of Islam called Wahhabism. CNN was unable to reach government officials for comment. Christoph Wilcke, a Saudi Arabia researcher for Human Rights Watch, told CNN in December that his organization has heard of many other cases of child marriages. ""We've been hearing about these types of cases once every four or five months because the Saudi public is now able to express this kind of anger -- especially so when girls are traded off to older men,"" Wilcke said. Wilcke said that although Saudi ministries might make decisions designed to protect children, ""It is still the religious establishment that holds sway in the courts, and in many realms beyond the court."" In December, Zuhair al-Harithi, a spokesman for the Saudi government-run Human Rights Commission, said his organization is fighting against child marriages. ""The Human Rights Commission opposes child marriages in Saudi Arabia,"" al-Harithi said. ""Child marriages violate international agreements that have been signed by Saudi Arabia and should not be allowed."" He added that his organization has been able to intervene and stop at least one child marriage from taking place. Wajeha al-Huwaider, co-founder of the Society of Defending Women's Rights in Saudi Arabia, told CNN that achieving human rights in the kingdom means standing against those who want to ""keep us backward and in the dark ages."" She said the marriages cause girls to ""lose their sense of security and safety. Also, it destroys their feeling of being loved and nurtured. It causes them a lifetime of psychological problems and severe depression.""","UNICEF: Marriage of a child is a violation of that child's rights .

"(Mental Floss) -- Benjamin Franklin said that nothing is certain in this world but death and taxes. The federal government allows taxpayers a $500 exemption for housing victims of a Midwestern disaster. In our more fast-paced times we might add the certainty of having to replace our iPods at least once every two years, but you get the point. Taxes are a part of the fabric of modern human society, yet they are totally beguiling to most ordinary folk. With laws like this, it's no wonder. 1. The jock tax . You can thank Michael Jordan for this one. After Jordan's Chicago Bulls put the hurt on the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1991 NBA finals, the state of California began to enforce a nonresident income tax on visiting performers, especially athletes. Basically, the tax applies to any income earned while competing or performing in California, and it allowed California's Franchise Tax Board to reach into the pockets of Jordan, Pippen, et. al. to extract some revenge for the hard-court beatdown. Not to be outdone, Illinois, and eventually 18 other states, instituted a jock tax, making a patchwork quilt of tax laws that basketball, baseball, and other sports figures have to consider. Thanks to these regulations, it's more difficult to file a professional athlete's tax return than to map the human genome on a Commodore 64. 2. The crack tax . In 1983, Arizona became the first state to implement a ""Cannabis & Controlled Substances Tax"" in order to boost state revenues and further punish those found guilty of possession. It works like this: if you are in possession of an illegal drug or illegally produced liquor (aka moonshine), you need to go down to the state tax collection agency and pay the tax on your illegal substances. You are then given tax stamps to affix on your illegal goods. Sounds insane, right? Well, part of the code now on the books in more than 30 states says that the tax collection agency is not allowed to rat you out to the local law enforcement agency. This should put every drug dealer's mind at ease, yet so few of them pay their required taxes. The truth is, many of these taxes are levied in arrears after the local constabulary has caught the criminal dealer. It's really an additional fine for dealing that gets paid straight to the state coffers. And what of those few people that pay the tax? Records show that the vast majority of them are stamp collectors. Mental Floss: 10 controversial stamps . 3. Take in a midwesterner . For 2008 and 2009, the IRS is allowing a $500 exemption for each person that you help house from a Midwestern disaster (e.g. the floods in Iowa and surrounding states). In typical IRS fashion, the rules dictating who can and cannot be counted for this charitable act are both coldly technical, and moderately vague. Need more info? Check out the scintillating IRS Publication 4492-B. It's a great beach read. 4. It's not a tattoo tax, it's a body art tax . Arkansas has added getting a tattoo to its list of services that require an additional 6 percent state tax. One other service that's subject to the tax is electrolysis. Mental Floss: Your tattoo might not mean what you think . 5. Hide the window, the taxman is coming . You'll never have to worry about this last tax since it was repealed in 1851, but it's just too silly not to mention. In 1696, a tax was placed on British homes based on the number of windows the home had. Previously the tax was levied per household, no matter the size of the house or the number of residents. The law changed, however, to levy higher taxes on larger homes with, presumably, more windows. Instead of paying the higher taxes, people just bricked up the windows that they found to be extraneous. An astute visitor to England can still see evidence of this law today in the scores of walled up windows in older buildings throughout the country. Mental Floss: 4 other times our economy tanked .

"(CNN) -- Perhaps it really WAS destiny. ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" the little film that overcame tremendous odds simply to earn an American release, won eight Oscars Sunday night at the 81st annual Academy Awards, including best picture. ""Most of all we had passion and we had belief, and our film shows if you have those two things, you have everything,"" said producer Christian Colson, surrounded by many members of the film's huge cast and crew. It was a supremely unlikely success story. ""Millionaire,"" which combines elements of Bollywood melodrama and documentary grit, features no stars. It's set largely among the poverty-stricken districts of Mumbai, India, and one-third of the film is in Hindi. Its initially reluctant director, Danny Boyle, is better known for brash British films such as ""Trainspotting"" and ""28 Days Later."" And the film almost went straight to DVD in America, thanks to the folding of initial studio Warner Independent Pictures (like CNN, it's a unit of Time Warner). But the film's orphaned, poverty-raised hero, played by Dev Patel, overcomes his challenges to earn a spot on the game show ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"" -- not necessarily to win money, but to connect with his lost love. On the show, he's told that perhaps he is a figure of destiny. ""It is written,"" the show's smarmy host tells him, somewhat mockingly, after Patel's character aces several questions. List of winners, nominees . ""Slumdog's"" filmmakers were jubilant at the wins, which also included Oscars for best director (Boyle), best adapted screenplay (Simon Beaufoy), score (A.R. Rahman), cinematography (Anthony Dod Mantle), song, sound mixing and film editing. Boyle jumped up and down as he accepted his award, saying he'd told his children that if he ever won, he'd bounce like Tigger from ""Winnie-the-Pooh."" Rahman was equally appreciative. ""All my life I've had a choice between hate and love, and I chose love, and now I'm here,"" he said.  Gallery: See what the stars are wearing » . ""Slumdog's"" main competition, ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,"" won just three Oscars, all in minor categories. The film had led the pack with 13 nominations. The rest of the Oscar broadcast alternated between host Hugh Jackman's smooth song-and-dance numbers, some comic moments from Steve Martin, Tina Fey and Ben Stiller, and politics, generally focused on gay rights and California's anti-gay marriage Proposition 8. Sean Penn won best actor for playing Harvey Milk in ""Milk,"" the story of the first openly gay man elected to major public office. Penn earned laughs and applause for his speech. iReport.com: What do you think of the winners? ""You commie homo-loving sons of guns,"" the sometimes truculent actor began, to laughter. ""I did not expect this, and I wanted to be very clear that I do know how hard I make it to appreciate me, often. But I am touched by the appreciation."" After a series of thank-you's, he turned serious in talking about gay marriage. ""For those who saw the signs of hatred as our cars drove in tonight, I think it's a good time for those who voted for the ban against gay marriage to sit and reflect on their great shame and their shame in their grandchildren's eyes if they continue that support,"" Penn said. ""We've got to have equal rights for everyone."" Dustin Lance Black, who won original screenplay for ""Milk,"" also gave an impassioned speech in favor of gay rights. ""I think [Milk] would want me to say to all the gay and lesbian kids out there tonight ... that you are beautiful, wonderful creatures of value, and that no matter what anyone tells you, God does love you and that very soon, I promise you, you will have equal rights, federally, across this great nation of ours."" Heath Ledger won best supporting actor for his performance as the Joker in ""The Dark Knight."" His parents and sister accepted the award for the actor, who died in January 2008. ""This award tonight would have humbly validated Heath's quiet determination to be truly accepted by you all here -- his peers -- within an industry he truly loved,"" said Ledger's father, Kim. Ledger is only the second actor to win a posthumous actor. Peter Finch won best actor for 1976's ""Network"" two months after he died in early 1977. Other winners included Kate Winslet, who won best actress for her performance in ""The Reader""; Penelope Cruz, who won best supporting actress honor for ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona""; and ""WALL-E,"" which won best animated feature. Most of the winners, if not foreordained, were expected. The evening's sole shock came with best foreign-language film, which went to the Japanese film ""Departures."" Among the films it beat were France's ""The Class"" and Israel's ""Dances With Bashir,"" two of the best-reviewed films of the year. The Oscars moved at a steady pace, largely thanks to Jackman's brisk, jokey work. Only the introductions to the four acting categories, in which previous winners read tributes to current nominees as if they were about to appear on ""This Is Your Life,"" considerably slowed the show, which ran close to three and a half hours. At various points, Jackman cracked wise about downsizing -- ""Next year,"" said the ""Australia"" star, ""I'll be starring in a movie called 'New Zealand' "" -- performed songs about each best picture nominee in various musical styles, and paid tribute to various celebrities as if pointing out VIPs in a nightclub. He even physically carried Anne Hathaway on stage to play Richard Nixon in a ""Frost/Nixon"" send-up. Blog: Behind the scenes . But it was ""Slumdog Millionaire"" that carried the evening. At one point, Resul Pookutty, who won for sound mixing, seemed overwhelmed as he accepted his Oscar. ""I dedicate this award to my country,"" he said.

"LOUISVILLE, Colorado (CNN) -- While the economy sputters here on Earth, space entrepreneurs in Colorado are looking to the heavens. Diane Dimeff and Scott Tibbitts of eSpace, a not-for-profit that helps aerospace companies test space technology. In a cavernous testing facility called the ""Incubator,"" specialized equipment recreates the unique conditions of a journey into space -- from platforms that mimic the violent shaking at liftoff to chambers that replicate space's bitter cold and complete vacuum. This is home to eSpace: The Center for Space Entrepreneurship, a not-for-profit partnership between SpaceDev, Inc., a private aerospace company, and the University of Colorado. Launched last month, eSpace helps fledgling aerospace companies try out new gadgetry and meet NASA specifications. ""One of the most important things in making space hardware is that it's going to [have to] work in space, because you can't repair it,"" said Scott Tibbitts, executive director of eSpace. ""It's up there, it has to work."" Tibbitts believes that in the near future, NASA's programs will be supplemented more often by entrepreneurial space ventures. He thinks eSpace can help these companies work toward making space exploration more affordable and accessible to private citizens. ""Our goal is to help small aerospace companies to get off the ground,"" said eSpace director Diane Dimeff. eSpace will help entrepreneurs ""to commercialize their technology and to help develop the work force that will fuel their growth."" The center's Incubator doubles as the headquarters of SpaceDev, which Tibbitts founded almost by accident more than a dozen years ago. He developed a paraffin actuator, a mechanism filled with a waxlike substance that melts when it reaches a certain temperature, flipping a switch. The device worked on hot-water heaters, but Tibbitts thought it might have high-tech applications elsewhere. ""I ended up contacting NASA and they said yeah,"" Tibbitts said. ""So we started building them for spacecraft instead of water heaters, and the business was built around that."" But it wasn't quite that simple. The first actuator for NASA cost $32,000 to make, and Tibbitts had to sell his Triumph sports car to raise the money. Also, Tibbitts' specialty was hot water heaters, not spacecraft. Products for NASA have to go through rigorous testing and be made to strict specifications. ""I knew nothing about it,"" he said. ""We'd ask NASA, 'Can we use Super Glue?' And they'd say, 'No, you can't use Super Glue.' "" Tibbitts' goal with eSpace is to help entrepreneurs avoid making the same mistakes. eSpace mentors new companies and helps guide them on the long journey from the workbench in the family garage to the launch pad. A important part of the process is access to the sophisticated testing equipment at the Incubator, located in a suburb northwest of Denver. ""The people making the hardware can test the hardware in that chamber and see if it's going to work in the harsh conditions of space,"" said Tibbitts while leading a tour of the facility. ""This is a half-a-million-dollar chamber. That's not something a small company can afford."" Dimeff hopes eSpace's collaboration with the University of Colorado will help guide young engineers into careers in space technology. To facilitate this, eSpace will fund three hands-on projects for graduate students to design aerospace technologies with commercial applications. ""They have great skills for the aerospace industry, and they would never have thought of going into the aerospace industry but for this program,"" Dimeff said. A few miles down the road, another space hardware company is hoping to benefit from eSpace's programs. ""I think the eSpace concept is really a very important one,"" said Michael Tupper, executive vice president of Composite Technology Development Inc., which makes resins, thermal insulation and other products. ""We can be much more effective when we are working with other entrepreneurial companies and combining our capabilities and technologies,"" he added. ""So eSpace will both create a network of companies and will also help with the educational basics."" Tupper sees huge growth ahead in space technologies and in technologies developed for space making their way back to Earth. High-temperature insulation his company developed for space is being repurposed for use in wind turbines and geothermal equipment. In that way, eSpace could help prepare engineers for a variety of jobs beyond the aerospace field -- a key benefit in a battered economy. ""The space market is a vital market, and it does require a lot of jobs,"" Tupper told CNN. ""But I think it's quite clear the terrestrial market has more jobs in larger industries. We're going to be needing to hire more and more people.""","The eSpace center helps fledgling aerospace companies try out new gadgetry .

"(CNN) -- Call it the second coming. Jennifer Connelly and Keanu Reeves star in ""The Day the Earth Stood Still."" Klaatu the spaceman first visited these parts in Robert Wise's 1951 Cold War classic ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" when he threatened to blow us all up unless we stopped threatening to do the job for him. Klaatu wasn't exactly greeted with open arms back then -- he was shot and hounded for his troubles -- and if the earth has moved on over the past half century, you wouldn't know it from the trigger-happy welcoming committee that surrounds his luminous snowball of a space craft in New York's Central Park. Where sci-fi films in the 1950s used to see red(s), today they go green. Directed by Scott Derrickson (""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"") and scripted by David Scarpa (""The Last Castle""), ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" 2.0 ditches the Cold War theme. Klaatu (Keanu Reeves) means to save the planet, but war isn't the problem. Mankind is the problem. The filmmakers have come up with an effective Spielbergian prologue, cutting from the Himalayas in 1928 to contemporary biology professor Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly), whisked from her home by uniformed men in response to an undisclosed national emergency. It's strange to think that in the final hour the government will turn to molecular biologists for guidance, though true to form (as in the 1951 original) the scientists are quickly overruled by the politicians. But once Keanu-Klaatu emerges from his blubbery placenta spacesuit, the movie shifts into familiar fugitive thriller terrain and the tension slowly drains out of it. Dr. Benson helps him escape to New Jersey where he can meet with an alien undercover agent in McDonald's, and she can introduce him to a true world leader, a Nobel laureate played by John Cleese. If you're going to cast a top star as an alien being, Reeves seems a solid choice. He's always been able to process human emotion with a Spock-like detachment. ""This body is going to take some getting used to,"" Klaatu cautions shakily in his first scene, but in fact he gets the walking-talking thing down pat in no time. He's a messianic figure -- he fires lasers out of his wrists, like a reverse-stigmata and he has the power to resurrect the dead (though unlike Jesus, Klaatu killed the guy in the first place). The climax even includes a plague of robotic locusts. But the movie never comes up with a convincing explanation for why his superpowers don't extend to, say, picking up a telephone. Apparently the aliens have been monitoring us for at least 70 years, but Klaatu is taken aback to discover our emotional side. Mostly he learns this from Jaden Smith, who plays Dr. Benson's stepson Jacob. It's not necessarily a good emotional side: Jacob is a whiny, obstinate and disobedient little boy that would lead most extraterrestrials -- and not a few of the rest of us -- to reach for the destruct button. Still, it's surely remiss to wipe out the species before lending an ear to Johann Sebastian Bach. The original movie is beginning to show its age, but at least it holds up as a story. That's more than you can say for a preachy, draggy blockbuster that espouses a radical message of Luddite technophobia at the same time as it conspicuously plugs Honda and LG Electronics, and dresses up its half-baked thinking in blinding (but not that brilliant) CGI wizardry. Johnny Carson used to joke that his 1964 bomb ""Looking for Love"" was so bad it was transferred to flammable nitrate film stock. If they're so determined to be green, perhaps the producers of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" would consider something biodegradable.

McLendon, the gunman in the American South, murder 10 people, why did Tim Kretschmer, the gunman in the German South, murder 15 people -- but even when a tentative answer is arrived upon, it almost certainly won't mean much. Because the real answer we're searching for -- the answer that will stop these bursts of bloodshed -- seems destined to ever elude us. There is always an impulse to blame obscene killing sprees on outside stimuli. In the years just after World War II, comic books were cited as an incitement for young people to harm each other. Violent television programs were subsequently blamed, as video games sometimes are today. The connective theory has long been: if society desensitizes people to violence, if violence becomes a commodity, then it will proliferate. If people are passively taught that violence is everywhere, then violence will sprout, if not everywhere, then many wheres. But to place the brunt of the blame for this on outside forces is to duck a truth that we are understandably reluctant to face: the impulse to murder without remorse seems to be, in some people, almost like a learned language, deriving from somewhere deep and difficult to find. Thankfully, it remains relatively rare, although during weeks like this one it is not easy to take much comfort in that. Yet with each new torrent of killings, with each new demonstration that, to some among us, the idea of spreading heartache and horror is not only acceptable, but attractive... With each new demonstration of that, we find ourselves once again looking for lessons, in a search that can seem perpetually futile. Are the gunmen in cases like these out to make a name for themselves? If so, they are ordained to fail; there was a time when multiple, random murders were enough to give the perpetrators such notoriety that their names became catchphrases. Charlie Starkweather, whose name means nothing to most people today, had more than one movie made about him after his killing spree on the American Plains in the 1950s. There was a time when we could ascribe, to people who murdered without mercy, a dark desire for the worst kind of fame. But that's gone. Those names you read in the second paragraph of this story -- Michael McLendon, Tim Kretschmer -- may be freshly in the news today, but you will have forgotten them in a month or two. That's one more numbing sign of just how ordinary extraordinary violence has become: the names fail to stick. The protagonists are interchangeable. How to stop this? There has long been a debate over whether the death penalty is a deterrent to murder, but this week the murderers themselves are both dead, and almost certainly they considered that probability before they set out to kill. The learned language of violence seems to contain a concession, on the part of those who absorb it, that their acts may very well conclude with their own dying -- and that the price, in their minds, is acceptable, even, perhaps, sought. Which may be the most chilling lesson of all. Because if even death for those who do it is not enough to stop the profane slaughters around the globe, then our impotence in the face of this feels all the more profound. Whatever our need may be to grasp for answers, the killers, by dying on the day they kill, deny us the chance for even that scant solace. It's the ultimate taunt; it is as if they are saying: You want to know why? You'll never know. Which leaves us with only one certainty: . Before long -- in a matter of days, or weeks, or months -- we'll be asking these questions again. The names will change; the specks on the map will be different. But somewhere, someone who has learned the wordless language of spreading hurt and grief will do this once more, and we will pause anew in our daily lives to wonder what has become of us. And feel all the more empty at the silence that greets our question. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: The real reason mass murderers kill people is elusive .

"(CNN) -- Canadian researchers say they have discovered the smallest known North American dinosaur, a carnivore that roamed areas of the continent 75 million years ago and weighed less than most modern-day house cats. Researchers say Hesperonychus, whose name means ""western claw,"" was about 1.6 feet tall. Hesperonychus elizabethae, a 4.4-pound (2-kilogram) creature with razor-like claws, ran through the swamps and forests of southeastern Alberta, Canada, during the late Cretaceous period, the researchers said. The diminutive dinosaur likely hunted insects, small mammals and other prey, perhaps even baby dinosaurs, said Nick Longrich, a paleontology research associate in the University of Calgary's Department of Biological Sciences. ""It's basically a predator of small things,"" Longrich said. Longrich co-wrote a paper on the dinosaur with University of Alberta paleontologist Philip Currie. The paper appeared in Monday's Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The researchers said the clawed dinosaur was slight, ran on two legs and had dagger-like teeth. It had an enlarged sickle-shaped claw on its second toe, the researchers said. Although fossilized remains of Hesperonychus were collected in 1982, they remained unstudied until Longrich came across them in the University of Alberta's collection in 2007, the university said. Because of their size, some of the fossilized parts had been thought to be from juveniles. Longrich said he suspected the claws had come from another, smaller adult species, but said finding a fossilized pelvis in which the hip bones were fused -- which happens only once an animal is fully grown -- convinced him. ""The claws were kind of a bread-crumb trail that we followed along,"" until finding the well-preserved pelvis, Longrich said. Longrich and Currie determined that Hesperonychus, whose name means ""western claw,"" stood about 1.6 feet (50 centimeters) high. Albertonykus borealis, a 2.5-foot-long insectivore, had been previously thought to be the smallest North American dinosaur. Longrich came across the dinosaur's bones in storage at the Royal Tyrrell Museum in Drumheller and decided to analyze them, Canadian Broadcasting Company reported in September. A dinosaur smaller than Hesperonychus has been found in China, Longrich said. He said he found searching through museums' storage more productive in the short term than working in the field. ""People collect stuff so much more quickly than they can process,"" he said. CNN's Taylor Gandossy contributed to this report.","Hesperonychus elizabethae, a 4.4-pound carnivore, lived 75 million years ago .

"(CNN) -- A military junta that toppled Guinea's government announced its new leader Wednesday in a nationwide radio address. Capt. Moussa Dadis Camara wrapped in the Guinean flag Wednesday. Capt. Moussa Dadis Camara declared himself president of the National Council for Democracy, which he called a transitional body that will oversee the country's return to democracy. In effect, that would make Camara president of Guinea, which was thrown into turmoil Monday after the death of President Lansana Conte. Camara also declared a curfew from 8 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. local time. Guinea's parliament is holding negotiations with the military, Africa News reporter Mamdou Dian Donghol Diallo told CNN. ""For the time being the situation is calm and negotiations are under way,"" Diallo said. ""There is no traffic. Everyone is staying inside their homes."" Camara, previously the spokesman for the National Council for Democracy, suspended the government, constitution, political parties and trade unions, Diallo said from Conakry. The newly formed government, made up of 26 military personnel and six civilians, is negotiating a power-sharing deal that would reflect its ethnic make-up, Diallo said. But some in the military may not support the new leadership, he said. International institutions, including the African Union, have condemned the coup. Guinea, in western Africa bordering the Atlantic Ocean, has had two presidents since gaining independence from France in 1958. Conte came to power in 1984, when the military seized control of the government after the death of the first president, Sekou Toure. The country did not hold democratic elections until 1993, when Conte was elected president. He was re-elected in 1998 and 2003 amid allegations of electoral irregularities. Worsening economic conditions and dissatisfaction with corruption and bad governance prompted two massive strikes in 2006, the CIA World Factbook says. A third nationwide strike in early 2007 sparked violent protests that resulted in two weeks of martial law. To appease the unions and end the unrest, the Factbook says, Conte named a new prime minister in March 2007. Guinea is one of the poorest countries in the world, despite its mineral wealth, according to the British charity Plan UK. The country hosts large refugee populations from neighboring Liberia and Ivory Coast.","NEW: Capt. Moussa Dadis Camara named de facto president of Guinea .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Jewish students and faculty at California universities fear for their safety on campus because of threats aimed at them over the Middle East conflict, the father of a slain Wall Street Journal reporter said Friday. Judea Pearl, the father of slain reporter Daniel Pearl, says anti-Semitism is on rise on college campuses. Judea Pearl, whose son, Daniel Pearl, was kidnapped and killed by al Qaeda extremists while on assignment in Pakistan in 2002, told reporters at a news conference that anti-Semitic e-mail and verbal threats have escalated since Israel's three-week invasion of Gaza in January. Pearl teaches computer science on UCLA's Westwood campus. On the school's Web site, UCLA Chancellor Gene Block issued a statement about the university's policy. ""The conflict in the Middle East and current events in Gaza are some of the most highly controversial issues of our time, stirring deep emotions on all sides,"" the statement read. ""We have a responsibility to protect the freedom of expression. We also all have a responsibility to listen and engage -- respectfully -- even as we must understand that not every campus forum on a controversial topic will satisfy passionate and concerned members of the campus and broader communities,"" said Block. Pearl and officials at the Simon Wiesenthal Center, where the news conference was held, are concerned that administrators on college campuses across the country are not doing enough to foster freedom of expression while protecting Jewish students and faculty members from acts of intimidation on campuses. ""The verbal abuse is there, the intimidation is there, the feeling of helplessness is there, not only among students but among faculty,"" said Pearl. Pearl cited an incident several years ago in which he was threatened. ""I received hate messages from someone at UCLA who did not identify himself and said, 'I saw you in Ackerman Union and I know where your office is and I'm going to beat the (expletive) out of you,'"" Pearl said. ""I handed it to the campus police, and they did not do anything."" UCLA spokeswoman Elizabeth Boatright-Simon told CNN there is no record of Pearl's complaint to campus police but said the university plans to meet with him. Wiesenthal Center officials cited another incident three weeks ago at San Jose State University where the consul general of Israel was verbally abused and forcibly driven from the stage during a guest-speaking engagement aimed at fostering understanding of Jewish culture. The diplomat, Akiva Tor, had to be escorted out of the room by security officers and campus police before the event ended, according to Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Wiesenthal Center and Michelle Salinsky, president of Spartans for Israel, the group which co-sponsored the speaking event. ""We were extremely concerned about our safety and Mr. Tor's safety,"" said Salinsky, a senior majoring in political science. ""Mr. Tor said he's never felt more disrespected. This was clearly an infringement of our expression of free speech. I think a lot of Jewish students do not feel safe on campuses because of the escalation of hate perpetrated against Jews."" San Jose State University spokeswoman Pat Harris told CNN the sponsors of the event were responsible for moderating the speaking forum but maintained that officers and security personnel acted appropriately. In a statement, the university president Jon Whitmore defended the university's policies but expressed concern about the event. ""Our campus places high value on the free exchange of ideas in a manner that is inclusive and respectful of differing views,"" the statement read. ""At a recent campus event, numerous members of the audience with views differing from the invited speaker were so vocal in their expression of opposition and so uncooperative with the moderator's requests for orderly means of handling questions and answers that they disrupted the event and did not allow the speaker to respond to posed questions. The university fully endorses the free expression of ideas and opinion, but does not condone behavior and methods of expression that disrupt free and orderly discussion."" As part of an effort to promote tolerance, the Wiesenthal Center announced plans to unveil a public service campaign next month which will be distributed online at Columbia University, UCLA, UC-Berkeley, San Jose State University and the University of Chicago, among other campuses. ""There are a lot of Jewish kids in California and elsewhere who are beginning to look elsewhere and saying maybe the UC system is not a user friendly place to go and we can't accept that,"" said Cooper.","Judea Pearl says anti-Semitism on rise since January's Gaza conflict .

"(CNN) -- Police on Saturday arrested a registered sex offender suspected of luring a 15-year-old girl on Myspace.com, authorities said. William Joe Mitchell, a registered sex offender, is suspected of luring a 15-year-old girl online. William Joe Mitchell was apprehended at a ""The Flying J Truck Stop"" just outside of Winchester, Virginia, authorities said. Virginia State Police arrested him without incident. Detectives received a tip Saturday that he was at the truck stop, located off Interstate 81, according to the Polk County sheriff's department.    Personal items belonging to the teenager were found in his car, according to the sheriff's statement. Mitchell had allegedly been communicating with Alyssa Frank on the popular Web site Myspace.com, officials said. Mitchell, 46, told Frank he was 24 years old, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd told CNN.   Virginia and Polk County, Florida, authorities and the U.S. Marshals Service in Tampa, Florida, were working together on the case. Polk County Sheriff's detectives found Frank earlier this week, one day after she disappeared. She was found wandering around a Wal-Mart store in DeFuniak Springs, Florida, and had apparently been abandoned by her alleged abductor. A store employee called police after noticing the girl. Mitchell took Frank to the store in an apparent attempt to ""dump her,"" Judd said.   Mitchell, in leaving the girl, told her not to draw attention to herself or he would kill her, Judd said in a statement.  Frank is believed to have left her house in Bartow, Florida, before dawn Monday to rendezvous with Mitchell, Judd said. He then apparently took her to Alabama. Mitchell brought her back to DeFuniak Springs, which is between Pensacola and Tallahassee on the Florida Panhandle. Polk County authorities said Mitchell faces charges including solicitation to commit a lewd act; enticing a child via the Internet; interference with custody; and traveling to meet a minor. He also is sought on warrants from Jacksonville, Florida, and Alabama, said Polk County sheriff's spokeswoman Donna Wood. The teen's father, Rodger Frank, told CNN Saturday he had no idea his daughter had been communicating with Mitchell. He urged parents to talk to their kids about what they are doing online. ""We've had serious talks about [not putting] information of your own out there to the people,"" he said. ""The Internet is for information. It's not a playground."" Frank said he is installing spy software on his computer to help him monitor what his daughter is doing. ""We think our children are well-behaved,"" he said. ""We have to watch them harder. We don't know everything."" Speaking with Rodger Frank, Judd warned others who are trying to take advantage of young people. ""We'll hunt you down like the felon and criminal you are,"" he said.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A 31-year-old Ecuadorean man who was beaten last Sunday in what New York City authorities say may have been a hate crime has died at a Queens hospital, his brother said Saturday. Jose Sucuzhanay was beaten after leaving a party at a Catholic church. Jose Sucuzhanay and his brother, Romel, had left a party on December 7 at St. Brigid's Roman Catholic Church when several men approached them in a car in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn, police said. The men allegedly began shouting anti-gay and anti-Latino vulgarities at the two men. Jose Sucuzhanay suffered severe head trauma and was taken to Elmhurst Hospital. He died Friday night from his injuries. Romel Sucuzhanay, 38, escaped with minor scrapes and has talked with detectives on the case. City Council Speaker Christine Quinn said she was ""horrified to learn that anti-LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transsexual) and anti-Latino slurs were used by one or more of the assailants, raising this event to the level of a hate crime.""  Watch how attack has outraged the Latino community » . Quinn said she was in touch with the NYPD's Hate Crimes Task Force. According to police, however, the attack has not been categorized as a hate crime. ""This is a wake-up call and shows how far we still must come to address the devastating problem of hate crimes in our communities,"" said Diego Sucuzhanay, Jose's brother, in a written statement. ""Only by exposing these crimes and working together will we be able to make a difference."" No arrests have been made in the case. Police are offering a $22,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in the attack. Sucuzhanay's mother arrived Saturday in New York from the family's home outside Quito, Ecuador, only to learn that he son had died, said family spokesman Francisco Moya. He said the victim had lived in the United States for more than a decade and was a legal resident, working as a real estate broker. A news conference is expected to be held Sunday afternoon.","Immigrant dies from injuries sustained in possible bias attack .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The number of homicides in New York City rose about four percent in 2008 compared with the previous year, preliminary figures from the city's police department showed. There were 516 homicides in New York City in 2008, according to preliminary police figures. The NYPD's CompStat data showed 516 homicides in the city last year, up from 496 in 2007. That's still a dramatic change from 1990, when 2,262 homicides earned New York the title of ""murder capital"" of the nation. Though the figures are subject to change, the 2008 tally also represents a drop from the 596 homicides investigated in New York in 2006. The NYPD, which began compiling the report in 1963, cited its Operation Impact as a chief reason for the improvement in recent years. The operation places more uniformed officers in concentrated areas where crime rates are high, the NYPD said.","There were 516 homicides in the city last year, up from 496 in 2007 .

"(OPRAH.com) -- It's probably good that I'm not rich. Money, it seems to me, sends people in one of three directions: . Lisa Kogan cites the increase in intelligent, witty, creative women as a reason she can be cheerful. It accelerates an innate inclination to be generous, or it accelerates a kamikaze inclination to party with the Olsen twins, or it sucks away your sense of purpose and produces a desperate need to eat nothing but those little white cheddar Cheez-It crackers while staring blankly at an endless cycle of ""Will & Grace"" reruns. I like to think that if I were rich, I'd be the kind of person who looks at the world and decides to fund cancer research and build schools and feed the hungry, and save whoever needs saving, but there's an excellent chance I'd be the kind of person who looks at the world and decides never to get out of bed again. In fact, despite my very real (and utterly inconvenient) need to earn a living, I'm still the kind of person who leans toward the whole Cheez-It thing. To begin with, I have a slight tendency toward depression (think Sylvia Plath listening to a freshly downloaded acoustic set from Leonard Cohen). And when this particular brain chemistry is confronted with the incredibly unsettling knowledge that people no longer work like dogs to get ahead, they work like dogs just to stay where they are, well, a girl starts needing a few good reasons to get up, put on a little lipstick, and venture out. But it's no secret that it's not pretty out there. Food prices are soaring, the housing market is plummeting, the middle class is disappearing, the climate is changing, and Madonna is touring. This is all the more reason to keep a soothing thought or two close at hand. Someday soon, I promise, we can sit down together and come up with a breathtaking bucket list that finally commits us to skydiving with Morgan Freeman just as we've secretly prayed we would, but today I'm offering a different kind of list. Oprah.com: How you (yes, you!) should live your life . Good reasons to put on a little lipstick and venture out (or at least put on clean pajamas and raise your window shade a couple of inches): . • Junior high is just one long daisy chain of nonstop mean, and you have officially survived it.

You will never have to read ""Beowulf,"" be groped by a 13-year-old reeking of his father's Aqua Velva, or feather your bangs again. The enormity of this revelation must not be underestimated. • Javier Bardem walks among us. • My delightfully decadent friend Stephen Whitlock recently discovered a recipe for bacon ice cream (DavidLebovitz.com), and get this -- the first step involves candying the bacon!

First came the polio vaccine, then Neil Armstrong made a giant leap for mankind, and today we actually have the technology to combine pork fat with butter fat, salty with sweet, crunchy with creamy. I firmly believe that what chicken soup does for the common cold, bacon ice cream will one day do for the premenstrual woman. • One word: Spanx. We can now have our scoop of bacon ice cream and wear a clingy Diane Von Furstenberg jersey wrap dress too. • Intelligent, witty, creative women appear to be on the rise. I like men. I like men so much that I even had a baby with one of 'em, but the baby is now 5, and it's nice to be able to show her some brilliantly talented females -- Rachel Maddow (MSNBC host), Mindy Kaling (playwright, producer, actress, ""The Office""), Janice Lee (her debut novel, ""The Piano Teacher"", hits stores in January, and it's an absolute knockout) -- who are very good at what they do. As role models go, Dora the Explorer only takes a mom so far. Besides, check out Dora's expressionless little brow -- I'm pretty sure it's coursing with Botox. • Ordinarily, I would not include houseguests on my list of bright spots, but Mabel, the dog I am currently babysitting, is causing me to rethink my position. Mabel suffers from a chronic greeting disorder that manifests itself as follows: I leave the room for 10, maybe 12 seconds. Upon reentry, Mabel welcomes me with a level of enthusiasm usually reserved for soldiers returning from three years in a POW camp -- a one-dog mariachi band of pure, unmitigated joy. Unless my boyfriend and our daughter sense that I'm carrying a pizza, my return from nine or 10 hours at the office rarely merits more than a mumbled ""They never came to fix the dishwasher.""

But the other night at our local diner when Julia accidentally catapulted her chocolate milk shake across our booth, there was my pal Valerie, dry cleaner's pen, ice water, and paper napkins at the ready. Val is just one of those intuitive, insightful, ironic, wildly generous, deeply adorable women who, despite working two jobs, is quietly, unequivocally there for the people she loves.

"(CNN) -- A woman accused of killing her 2-year-old daughter and dumping her body in Texas' Galveston Bay went on trial Tuesday on capital murder charges in the child's death, court officials said. Kimberly Dawn Trenor has pleaded guilty to an evidence-tampering charge, her attorney says. Kimberly Dawn Trenor, 20, pleaded guilty last week to tampering with evidence in the case, but she pleaded not guilty to the capital murder charge, said her attorney, Tom Stickler. Trenor's husband, Royce Clyde Zeigler II, 25, also faces capital murder and evidence-tampering charges, but is being tried separately and has not been arraigned. The body of Trenor's daughter, Riley Ann Sawyers, was found in October 2007 in a large plastic blue container on an uninhabited island in Galveston Bay. Jurors in Trenor's trial also will determine her sentence on the evidence-tampering charge, which carries a penalty of two to 20 years in prison, according to The Houston Chronicle. Riley Ann's case drew national attention after a fisherman found her body. Authorities were unsure of her identity, and police dubbed her ""Baby Grace."" After authorities distributed composite sketches of the girl nationwide, Sheryl Sawyers, the girl's paternal grandmother, contacted police from her Ohio home to say the drawing resembled her granddaughter. DNA testing confirmed the child's identity. According to an affidavit, Trenor told police Riley had been beaten and thrown across a room and that her head was held under water before she died on July 24, 2007. She said the couple hid the girl's body in a storage shed for one to two months before they put it in the plastic container and dumped it into the bay. The disposal of the girl's body led to the evidence-tampering charge. A medical examiner said Riley's skull was fractured in three places, injuries that would have been fatal. A capital murder charge carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison, the Chronicle reported. A cross has since been erected on the island where the toddler was found, which was named Riley's Island in her honor, according to the Houston newspaper. Trenor and the girl moved to Texas from Ohio in May 2007 to be with Zeigler, whom Trenor had met on the Internet. While in custody, Trenor gave birth this summer to another child, who is now in the care of relatives, her attorney, Tom Stickler, said.","Kimberly Dawn Trenor accused of killing her 2-year-old known as ""Baby Grace""
