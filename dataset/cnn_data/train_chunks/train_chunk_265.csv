"(CNN) -- The defense and prosecution were hammering out a plea deal Tuesday in the court-martial of Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Sinclair, but no matter what the negotiations hold, the defense says three things are off the table. First, Sinclair won't plead guilty to sexual assault, said Josh Zeitz, a spokesman for the general's defense team. Nor will he plead guilty to any charge that will land him on a sex-offender registry. And lastly, Zeitz said, Sinclair will not plead guilty to threatening his accuser or her family. No developments are expected Tuesday or Wednesday, and Zeitz said the negotiations could last for weeks. Col. James Pohl, the judge in the case, dismissed the jury ""for the time being"" Tuesday morning to return to their duty stations, a spokeswoman for Fort Bragg in North Carolina said. On Monday, a day when Sinclair's accuser was slated to continue her testimony from Friday, Pohl dismissed the jury because of 22 pages of e-mails that emerged over the weekend. The e-mails include a January communication in which a senior military lawyer wrote Fort Bragg's chief of military justice casting doubt on the credibility of Sinclair's accuser and a February correspondence in which a lieutenant colonel with the Judge Advocate General's Corps asked for a colonel's ""thoughts/opinion"" on Sinclair's offer to enter a plea. Pohl indicated there may have been ""undue command influence"" by Pentagon officials. While Pohl would not grant the defense's request to drop charges against Sinclair, he ordered that the general be provided a possible plea deal, in addition to several other options. The defense team is evaluating several options after the release of the e-mails, Zeitz said. Sinclair's attorneys have also filed a FOIA for all Pentagon e-mail communication including keywords in the Sinclair case. About 10,000 e-mails among 12 senior Pentagon officials were identified, and the Pentagon is reviewing the communications, Zeitz said, adding the defense expects the e-mails to be released slowly. If a plea deal is reached and something pivotal emerges in the e-mails, the defense would file a new motion for dismissal of charges, he said. Sinclair, formerly one of the top Army commanders in Afghanistan, pleaded guilty to several charges last week, including committing adultery, engaging in inappropriate relationships with three women, conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman and obstruction of justice, the public affairs office for Fort Bragg said. The government's lawyers dropped two counts -- one of conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman, and the other for cruelty and maltreatment -- while Sinclair still stands accused of ""sodomy ... by force and without the consent"" of his alleged victim, an Army captain. Charges also loom for alleged cruel and maltreatment of subordinates and defrauding the government, according to Fort Bragg.

"(CNN) -- With a breezy sweep of his pen President Vladimir Putin wrote a new chapter into Crimea's turbulent history, committing the region to a future returned to Russian domain. Sixty years prior, Ukraine's breakaway peninsula was signed away just as swiftly by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. But dealing with such a blatant land grab on its eastern flank won't be anywhere near as quick and easy for Europe's 28-member union. Because, unlike Crimea's rushed referendum, everyone has a say. After initially slapping visa restrictions and asset freezes on a limited number of little known politicians and military men, Europe is facing urgent calls to widen the scope of its measures to target the Russian business community in particular. The logic of this is that those who run Russia and own it are essentially two sides of the coin. Alexei Navalny, one-time Moscow mayoral contender now under house arrest for opposing the current regime, called for Europe's leaders to ban everyone -- from Vladimir Putin's personal banker to Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich from keeping their money and loved ones abroad. Asset freezes and visa restrictions are especially palatable options for the EU because they can be rolled out on a discretionary basis, without requiring cumbersome legal procedures and recourse. In fact Russia cancels visas for people it doesn't like all the time. Just look at Hermitage Capital founder Bill Browder who lost both his right of entry and Moscow-based money in 2005 and dare not go back. Russia also banned the adoption of its orphans by Americans in retaliation for the US's implementation of an anti-corruption law named after Sergei Magnitsky, Browder's lawyer who died after a year in a Moscow detention center, apparently beaten to death. Yet in playing the 'money talks' card, Europe must be ready for the consequences of such action. Because money also walks. As such EU leaders must be ready to accept sanctions are a two-way street and will hurt both sides. Targeting Russia's peripatetic business community would be one way of sapping their tenuous support for President Putin. And such a strategy might also turn out to have a silver lining: awarding EU countries a chance to finally deal with some of the more unpleasant sides of their patronage, including money laundering and corruption, which have inflated prize assets like London property and Picasso paintings for years. Where Europe should hold fire though is trade. Two decades of post-Soviet rapprochement and almost $500 billion worth of commerce is a lot to put at stake. It's true that any trade war would hurt Russia far harder than it would the EU - not least because 15% of the former's GDP comes from exports to the bloc. But Europe - with its hefty reliance on Russian gas - would have a hard time keeping its factories going and citizens warm without power from the east. And while Putin flexes his political muscle, open trade channels keep the dialogue going giving all sides a chance to change the subject and talk less tensely. No one can afford to cut off that lifeline, especially now with Europe's economy on the rebound and Russia's one on the wane.","Nina dos Santos says Europe must be ready to accept sanctions will hurt both sides .

"(CNN) -- ""The fastest man in rugby"" could soon be showing his sprinting skills in the NFL after the Detroit Lions signed United States sevens international Carlin Isles. Isles was a college sprinter in the 60 meters at Ashland United and has completed the 40-yard dash in under 4.3 seconds. His fastest 100m time of 10.13s would have qualified for the semifinals at the London 2012 Olympics. A winger in rugby, he will be a wide receiver in the Lions' practice squad. The 24-year-old, who took up rugby in 2012, was given his chance following a trial after tight end Matt Veldman was promoted to the Lions' active roster. ""If you want to develop one of those guys you have to give some guys a chance here or there and this was an opportunity to be able to do that because of the way our roster is and bringing some of the guys up that we have, we have a spot open,"" Lions coach Jim Schwartz told the NFL's team website. The move does not mean Isles will pack in rugby altogether as he confirmed on his official Twitter account that he will be taking part in the next round of the Sevens World Series in Las Vegas on January 24-26. ""Rugby is quite similar to American football,"" Isles told CNN's Rugby Sevens Worldwide show last month. ""Besides the blocking and no pads, the tackling is similar. But American football you've got breaks -- rugby, you don't have no breaks, you've got to keep running and running."" Isles, who played gridiron at high school and college in Ohio before becoming a professional athlete, isn't the first player from another sport to attempt the transition. Indianapolis Colts gave former rugby union player Daniel Adongo two games earlier this year, while Lawrence Okoye, a discus thrower at the 2012 Olympics, is on the books of the San Francisco 49ers. ""He's a legit track guy,"" said Schwartz of Isles. ""I mean, his background happened to be rugby, but it's probably more track and that speed -- that's not unusual at all to see track athletes get chances."" And the Lions coach is confident Isles can successfully make the switch. ""An athlete's an athlete,"" said Schwartz. ""There are skills that you can develop, and if you see something you like then you can work with him. ""I think our personnel department does a really good job of searching that. There's a lot of layers to stuff like that, but whether it's a rugby player or a basketball player, if they can bring something to the table that is unique and make it worth working with them then we're open to it."" The Lions are looking to improve next year after a disappointing campaign in which the team has dropped from a 6-3 record to 7-8 ahead of this weekend's regular-season finale against Minnesota Vikings.","Detroit Lions sign United States rugby sevens international Carlin Isles .

"(CNN) -- A third person has died as a result of last week's incident in which a driver plowed into people at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, police said Monday. Austin Police spokeswoman Veneza Bremner identified her as Sandy Thuy Le, 26. A family spokesperson said Le's family was by her side at the hospital in Austin when she died Monday morning. Stuart Gates, Le's brother-in-law, described her as a ""free spirit"" -- quirky, fun and always smiling. According to Gates, Le's family lives in Pass Christian, Mississippi, and her funeral will be held in her home state in the next few days. Gates also said Le's family has been through a lot in recent years, first losing their home in Hurricane Katrina, then their shrimping business was financially hurt by the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill. Authorities said Rashad Charjuan Owens drove into people and vehicles at the festival while he was intoxicated early Thursday. Owens, 21, was charged last week with two counts of capital murder. Police said Owens drove into the crowds after refusing to stop for an officer who tried to pull him over. Besides the first two people who died, 23 people were initially hospitalized, some with multiple internal injuries. Most of the victims are in their 20s, said Dr. Christopher Ziebell, medical director at the University Medical Center Brackenridge. A Travis County grand jury will determine whether Owens will face any more charges because of the third death, Bremner said. CNN's John Branch, Jason Hanna and Justin Lear contributed to this report.","Sandy Thuy Le, 26, has died of injuries suffered when a car plowed into crowds last week .

"(CNN) -- Travelers who get kicks out of posing with huge Buddha statues have 10 more reasons to head to China this year. The company responsible for Hong Kong's 34-meter-tall Tian Tan Buddha and Hainan's 108-meter-tall Guanyin of the South Sea of Sanya statue plans to throw up 10 more huge Buddha replicas during 2014, according to the Chinese magazine New Weekly (Chinese only). The new builds have been inspired by the success, and profits, at Lingshan Park in Wuxi, Jiangsu province, which features an 88-meter-tall Buddha statue also built by Aerosun Corporation, and drew 3.8 million visitors last year. The statue helped earn the park more than RMB 1.2 billion ($194 million) in 2013 according to the South China Morning Post. Tourism excellence . Of the 408 visitors who reviewed the park on Tripadvisor.com, 205 people rated the attraction as ""excellent."" ""Lingshan tourist center is a great afternoon out, sure there is a lot of captive marketing but after spending that amount of money on such a beautiful place they deserve to make a few RMB out of us,"" wrote KeefieG from East London, South Africa in November. Mr Xie X from Dobbstown was more skeptical: ""This is a tourist trap if I ever saw one. I mean really, over two hundred RMB to see a statue? And not even any historical relevance,"" he wrote in his review. Other big Buddhas . The world's tallest Buddha is also the world's largest statue -- China's Spring Temple Buddha in Lushan County, Henan Province totals 208 meters from the base of its pedestal to the top of its head. The world's largest stone Buddha -- the 71-meter-high Leshan Giant Buddha -- can be found in Mount Emei Scenic Area, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in China's Sichuan Province. It was carved out of a hillside more than 1,200 year ago. Hong Kong's Tian Tan Buddha is a relatively diminutive 34 meters tall. Its total height would barely reach the Spring Temple Buddha's knees. Nevertheless, the Hong Kong tourism board estimates more than one million people visit the Buddha each year, many of whom get there via the 20-minute Ngong Ping cable car ride.","Construction of more than 10 Buddha statues are planned in China this year .

"(CNN) -- A suspect in a two-state kidnapping plot involving a prosecutor's father made an initial appearance in federal court on Thursday, authorities said. Quantavious Thompson, 18, was arrested late Wednesday in Atlanta. He waived his right to an identity hearing, FBI spokeswoman Shelley Lynch said. His detention hearing is scheduled for April 23. Another suspect, Jakym Camel Tibbs, 21, was still being sought, Lynch said. The FBI has offered a $25,000 reward for the two men, but Lynch said Thursday that it is too soon to determine whether the offer played a role in the capture of Thompson. Thompson's apprehension marked the sixth arrest in the April 5 abduction of Frank Janssen from his home in Wake Forest, North Carolina. He was rescued by police five days later at an apartment in Atlanta. The kidnappers sent demands to Janssen's family ""for the benefit"" of Kelvin Melton, an inmate at Polk Correctional Institution in Butner, North Carolina, according to an affidavit in support of a search warrant related to criminal complaints against the defendants. Janssen's daughter, Colleen Janssen, is an assistant district attorney in Wake County and had prosecuted Melton, officials said. Melton is serving a life sentence without parole. Authorities said they traced a call to Melton's prison cell, from where he communicated with the kidnappers. The FBI said the group planned to kill Janssen and bury him at the apartment complex, which is near the federal penitentiary in Atlanta, according to CNN affiliate WXIA. CNN's Vivian Kuo and Ralph Ellis contributed to this report.","NEW: Quantavious Thompson appears in court Thursday .

"(CNN) -- Mike Ellery was always used to having his little sister trying to copy him -- but not even he saw her latest stunt coming. While the 24-year-old was always destined to be a rugby star for England, never did he think that he'd be traveling across the world with his sister, Megan, in tow. For the first time ever, England's squad has a brother and sister competing on the international stage -- just a bit different from tackling each other inside the family home. ""I can show you several scars and bruises from our upbringing,"" Megan told CNN's Rugby Sevens Worldwide show. ""I think we are quite a standard competitive brother and sister, so anything he'd do, I'd try and do better. ""We used to play across the landing at home whenever Mike wanted to try out his new steps, and yeah, it didn't end well for me."" Rugby sevens -- the faster and shorter form of union -- is one of the world's fastest growing sports and will make its Olympic debut at Rio de Janeiro in 2016. Mike, who signed a two-year deal to play sevens for England in 2012, learned his trade in the north of the country under the guidance of his father, Nick, in the family's hometown of Penrith. It was here, while watching her older brother impress, that Megan dreamed of doing similar. ""Penrith is absolutely rugby mad,"" she told CNN. ""The whole town, the rugby club is just a huge community so we've been brought up with just a passion for rugby. ""When I was a lot younger, I used to spend a lot of my upbringing on the sidelines watching him play. ""I sort of had an interest in rugby since then and played from when I was about 11 to when I was about 13, then haven't really played it since. ""But watching him compete in the Sevens circuit, it's just such an exciting game. I really, really wanted to get involved so went along to the open trial and here I am."" Megan's presence at November's Dubai Sevens was a big shock to both siblings -- especially since she had been trying her luck at netball while at university. Mike thought that his sister would be going away on a gap-year following her graduation -- only for her to ghost in on the blindside and turn up right next to him. With just three years between them, the pair remain close even if they do not get to see each other too often, with Mike traveling around the world on the men's circuit. ""I don't get to see her much at home as I only go home at Christmas time maybe,"" said Mike. ""It's nice to see her but then I'm immensely proud of her. Especially as she only started playing properly about seven or eight months ago. ""She's picked it up quite quickly and she's obviously got quite a lot of natural talent. I'm very proud of her."" Megan showed off her talent in Dubai in impressive fashion -- scoring four tries to finish the tournament as England's highest points scorer. For somebody who made the England squad after playing just a handful of games for her university side and development squad, Megan's rise has been remarkable. She will now hope to shine once more in Atlanta when the women's second round gets underway on February 15, while Mike will be with the men in Las Vegas for their fourth leg of a nine-country swing in late January. But for Megan, it is her brother's achievements which will always inspire her. ""It's kind of against my instincts to pay him a compliment, but obviously I have quite a lot of admiration for Mike and what he's achieved in the game.""","Mike and Megan Ellery both play rugby sevens for England .

"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- Police armed with rubber bullets were patrolling neighborhoods in Johannesburg on Tuesday in an effort to quell a recent spree of violence aimed at foreigners that police say has killed 22 people and displaced an estimated 13,000. A crowd armed with clubs, machetes and axes rioted on the outskirts of Johannesburg on Tuesday. Many of the victims are Zimbabweans who have fled repression and dire economic circumstances in their homeland. Evidence of the violence was seen in smoke rising from burned homes in one Johannesburg neighborhood. Locals angry about the rising number of foreigners arriving in South Africa had set homes ablaze. Firefighters said they had fought more than 100 such blazes since Thursday. Standing outside a row of charred homes, Diamond Minnaar said there is a solution for foreigners. ""Most of them just have to go back to their country and leave us in peace,"" Minnaar said. ""That is the only solution. Or they are just going to get killed. Look at how many shacks have burnt down."" The attacks and looting have drawn condemnation from South African officials and other African leaders. iReport.com: Are you there? Send photos, video . The violence began a week ago in Johannesburg's Alexandra Township, police say, and has been concentrated in the city's poorest areas. ""People are angry because they are unemployed, poverty-affected people struggling for basic needs every day,"" said Dean Christopher Barends, a local Lutheran minister. ""This will explode into something."" One person victimized was Pascoal Sendela Gulane, a Mozambican man, who said gangs broke into his home and stole his belongings. He fled to a church with his family and is now living with his children in his car on the church's property. For him and many others, churches and police stations have become safe havens.  Watch footage of the attacks » . On Monday, South African President Thabo Mbeki called for an end to the violence. ""We dehumanize ourselves the moment we start thinking of another person as less human than we are simply because they come from another country"" he said in a statement. ""As South Africans, we must recognize and fully appreciate that we are bound together with other Africans by history, culture, economics and, above all, by destiny. I call upon those behind these shameful and criminal acts to stop! Nothing can justify it."" He has called for an investigation into the violence. Also Monday, the Nelson Mandela Foundation issued a statement condemning the ""senseless violence."" South African police have arrested more than 200 people in connection with the violence for offenses including rape, murder, robbery and theft. Police director Govindsamy Mariemuthoo said that at least one foreigner was burned alive over the weekend, while others saw their houses torched, their shops looted and their possessions stolen. Tuesday there was a large police presence in the neighborhoods were the violence had occurred, according to a CNN producer on the scene. Despite the police presence, sporadic looting still took place in several townships east of Johannesburg. Mbuso Mthembu, provincial manager at the Red Cross office in Johannesburg, said that the number of people fleeing is continuing to grow and that violent attacks seem to be spreading into other areas. His organization has made an emergency appeal for people to donate 1 million rand (about $135,000) to help support the estimated 13,000 who have fled their homes. Many had to flee quickly, leaving all their belongings behind, Mthembu said. ""We have delivered blankets, kids clothing, baby formula,"" he said. ""But we need more.""","An estimated 13,000 people fled homes after violence targeting foreigners .

"CHATTANOOGA, Tennessee (CNN) -- An annual family fishing trip to the Florida keys took a bloody and life-changing turn for Jordan Thomas. Noah Parton, 6, got prosthetics from foundation started by Jordan Thomas, right. ""It was a beautiful day and we were going to go out spear fishing that night,"" said Thomas, who was 16 during the 2005 trip. But when he jumped into the water, the boat's wake dragged Thomas hard into its sharp, whirling propellers. He immediately knew what was about to happen. ""I looked down -- my black fins were gone and all I saw was red just everywhere,"" said Thomas, an athletic teen who was captain of his high school's golf team. ""But I had this unbelievable calmness over my body.""  Watch video of Thomas telling his story » . His father and mother, both doctors from Chattanooga, Tennessee, jumped into action. ""All of a sudden, my 16-year old, happy-go-lucky captain of the golf team was potentially dying,"" said Dr. Liz Kennedy-Thomas. She worked to stanch the blood flow from her son's legs while his father rushed the boat to shore and fetched paramedics. Thomas was rushed to a hospital where he spent the next two weeks -- undergoing several surgeries on what was left of his legs and, along the way, discovering what would become his life's work. While there, Thomas visited other amputees. ""I just remember seeing so many kids who didn't have parents, didn't have health care,"" he said. ""I just knew that the future was grim for them."" The top-of-the-line prosthetics Thomas was fitted with -- the ones that helped him return to the golf links -- cost about $22,000. He learned that many insurance plans only cover about $5,000. That's especially tough on child amputees, who will outgrow several limbs before adulthood. ""I had no clue,"" he said. ""It's one of those things, unless you're affected by it, you just don't know."" Thomas knew he was lucky. With a financially stable family, he'll always be able to afford good legs. He asked his family to give a donation to help others, but ultimately they decided to launch a fundraising foundation together. ""By the time we got home, we had bracelets -- all kinds of stuff,"" Kennedy-Thomas said. ""The foundation was just sort of started by the time we got home."" The Jordan Thomas Foundation has raised $350,000 through bracelets, charity golf tournaments and cookouts. Some of that is paying for prosthetics for three children until they reach age 18. One of them is Noah Parton. The precocious 6-year-old born with a congenital heart defect had a complication with a tube inserted in his right leg, leading to an amputation above his knee. His family's insurance would only pay for what's called a ""stubby"" -- a wooden artificial leg without a bendable knee. ""His first bendable knee ... didn't have a certain number or something that would apply and they refused to pay for it,"" said Noah's mother, Nancy Parton, who lives with her son about an hour north of Chattanooga, in Evensville, Tennessee. Noah couldn't run and play with other children. And even day-to-day activities were tough. ""It was hard to put him in the car because his leg stuck out straight and I'd have my seat up as far as it would go and it would still hit the back of the seat,"" she said. Thomas's foundation stepped in, buying Noah several knee devices -- a new one for each new leg he needs as he grows. Now, his mom said, Noah is unstoppable. ""He loves to climb stairs now; he tries to ride bicycles,"" she said. ""You name it, he does it. ""Take him to the park [with] any other kid; he'll just blow you away."" As Congress debates overhauling the nation's healthcare system, prosthetics are quietly getting some attention. In May, Rep. Robert Andrews, a New Jersey Democrat, introduced the Prosthetic and Orthotic Parity Act, which would require insurance companies to cover prosthetics at the same rate they do surgery. ""It's pretty simple,"" Andrews said. ""Prosthetic devices are not cosmetic. You can't walk without one or you can't lift something without one and I think one of the reasons people are so upset about the health care system in this country is they had hassles like this."" Seventeen states have passed similar laws, most recently Missouri. But amputee advocates say there needs to be a national law. Kendra Calhoun, president and CEO of the Amputee Coalition of America, says there are 1.8 million amputees in the United States and at least 25,000 of them are children. Calhoun said that with more sweeping healthcare legislation taking all the attention, ""our biggest hurdle [for a prosthetics law] right now is being heard."" Some insurance companies have argued that premiums would go up for everyone if they're forced to cover prosthetics to the extent advocates want. Advocates cite a study they say shows it would cost beneficiaries about five cents per month. Meanwhile Jordan, who's now a junior in college, says he'd like to become a voice for otherwise voiceless children. ""I'd really like to move into advocacy, giving a voice to the amputee community and just helping as many people as possible,"" he said. ""Just making a difference and letting these kids live normal and happy, productive lives."" CNN's Doug Gross contributed to this report.","Fishing trip turned tragic for 16-year-old Jordan Thomas .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- About half of the staff of the National Hurricane Center have signed a petition calling for the ouster of the center's director, saying its ""effective functioning"" is at stake as the Atlantic hurricane season heads toward its peak. National Hurricane Center Director Bill Proenza said he was reprimanded for comments about replacing a key satellite. ""An unfortunate public debate is now occurring over the ability of the National Hurricane Center to meet its mission,"" the petition, released Thursday, says. ""The undersigned staff of the National Hurricane Center has concluded that the center needs a new director, and with the heart of the hurricane season fast approaching, urges the Department of Commerce to make this happen as quickly as possible."" Twenty-three people signed the petition -- about half the center's total staff, but about 70 percent of those who were available and discussed the statement Thursday, said James Franklin, a senior hurricane specialist. The center's current director, Bill Proenza, took over in January after the retirement of Max Mayfield. Proenza caused an uproar last month with comments about a key hurricane satellite called QuikScat. The satellite is five years beyond its life expectancy and operating on a backup transmitter. Proenza said if it were to fail, forecast tracks could be thrown off by as much as 16 percent. He told CNN that Washington reprimanded him for the comments -- ""They wanted me to be quiet about it."" But one of the center's veteran forecasters said Proenza's comments were misguided. ""QuikScat is another tool that we use to forecast,"" Lixion Avila said. ""The forecast will not be degraded if we don't have the QuikScat."" The Commerce Department this week launched an unscheduled review of the hurricane center after word of the staff's dissatisfaction started to become public, The Associated Press reported. Hurricane center staffers told CNN's John Zarrella they were not consulted before Proenza made the remarks and replacing the satellite would not be one of their priorities. But they said their dissatisfaction stems not only from Proenza's comments, but also from the environment at the center -- one of closed doors and the public airing of dirty laundry. Staffers say they are worried the hurricane center's mission is being undermined and that public confidence in the center could erode -- meaning the public might not take the center's storm warnings or evacuation alerts seriously, for instance. The statement was not sent to the Commerce Department, Zarrella said, but was sent to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's public affairs office. The National Hurricane Center is under NOAA's authority. E-mail to a friend .","23 staff members sign petition asking for director's ouster .

"Medolla, Italy (CNN) -- The death toll from a 5.8-magnitude earthquake in northern Italy rose to 17 after the discovery of another body, officials said Wednesday, as questions were asked about why factory buildings collapsed. The latest body was found in the rubble of the collapsed factory in the area of Medolla, Italy's civil protection agency said. The prosecutor's office in the province of Modena, where the quake was centered, opened an investigation Wednesday into the cause of death of the quake victims, many of whom were factory workers. Investigators will examine how the factories were built and why they couldn't withstand an earthquake of Tuesday's magnitude. Modena's chief prosecutor, Vito Zincani, told CNN that as modern buildings, they should have remained standing. Most of the modern structures in the area were not damaged, he said, so the fact that some factories collapsed ""shows an anomaly that needs investigation."" Look at high-resolution images of the disaster . The earthquake, which forced thousands of people from their homes, came nine days after a 6.0-magnitude quake struck the same region, killing seven people. Tuesday's quake, which struck at about 9 a .m. local when many people had begun work, was followed by dozens of aftershocks. The U.S. Geological Survey recorded one of 5.6 magnitude. Italian ministers met Wednesday morning and decided on several measures to be taken in the aftermath of the quake. The government declared a state of emergency in the quake area and set June 4 as a national day of mourning, according to a press statement. An extra two-cent tax will also be added to gasoline to help finance the recovery effort, it said. Italy's President Giorgio Napolitano, Prime Minister Mario Monti and the speakers of both Italian houses of parliament on the earthquake met later Wednesday at the presidential palace in Rome to discuss the disaster. The towns of Mirandola and Cavezzo, northwest of the city of Bologna, were closest to the epicenter, civil protection authorities said. Witnesses reported on Twitter that Cavezzo was about 70% destroyed. Pictures purportedly from the town, as well as a video stream from Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, show damaged and destroyed buildings. Churches and historic structures were among the affected buildings. In the small town of Novi di Modena, a 65-year-old priest died inside his church as he tried to save its statue of the Madonna. Construction workers who were out surveying the damage in Medolla were emotional as they spoke of their experiences a day earlier. Mohmammed Mouhalhal told CNN he was at work when the earthquake struck. He and his fellow construction workers now fear for their jobs and their safety, he said. He said no one could sleep Tuesday night and they stayed outside for fear of further quakes. Some 50 tremors were felt in the area overnight. Italian authorities are still assessing the economic impact of the earthquakes on the region, which lies in northern Italy, the heartland of the country's manufacturing industry. Leaders of agricultural and industrial organizations, speaking to Italian media, have estimated the cost of the disaster at nearly one billion euros. The Italian daily newspaper Repubblica puts the damage to the biomedical industry in Medolla alone at about â‚¬600 million ($751 million). Many cheese makers are also among those affected. Stefano Berni, president of the consortium that makes Grana Padano, a hard cheese similar to Parmesan, told CNN that some 350,000 whole cheeses, each weighing 40 kilograms (88 pounds), had been shaken to the ground. No more than 40% of those are likely to be salvageable, he said, leading to estimated losses of â‚¬70 million ($88 million). About 600 cheese producers located in the area north of the earthquake epicenter have suffered damage to their production centers and warehouses, he said. About 50,000 families, including the milk producers and cheese makers, work for the industry. Other factories and warehouses that have not been damaged by the quake will still suffer losses because they have had to halt production for safety checks. Geophysicist Antonio Piersanti, of the National Institute of Geophysics and Vulcanology, told Corriere della Sera that it was possible more earthquakes could follow in the coming weeks. The last significant earthquake in this area was in 1571. It was followed by about four years of aftershocks.

"(CNN) -- National Hockey League veteran Rick Rypien was found dead at his rural Alberta home Monday. ""We are deeply saddened to confirm Rick's passing,"" said a statement released by the Winnipeg Jets Hockey Club. ""His hunger for the game made him a valued team member both on and off the ice. This loss has impacted us as more than just a hockey team."" The 27-year-old forward was found dead at his Crowsnest Pass home, Royal Canadian Mounted Police officials told the Toronto Globe and Mail. His cause of death did not appear to be suspicious. Rypien, who had spent his entire six-season NHL career with the Vancouver Canucks, signed a one-year contract with the Jets last month, the team said. ""Rick has been a beloved member of the Canucks family for the past six years,"" Vancouver said in a statement. ""Rick was a great teammate and friend to our players, coaches and staff."" Rypien also played for the Manitoba Moose of the American Hockey League and the the Western Hockey League's Regina Pats during his professional career.

"London (CNN) -- Something strange is going on in Britain. Some of the biggest TV stars of the 20th century are donning luscious wigs and scaring the wits out of children. And Queen Elizabeth isn't in a position to stop them either -- she's guilty of joining in herself. Overweight men are squeezing themselves into dresses, young women are prancing about on stage incessantly slapping their own thighs, and everywhere families are wildly screaming ""He's behind you!"" It doesn't make any sense. But then, that's pantomime -- or ""panto"" as the British fondly refer to it -- a musical comedy unleashed across theaters every Christmas season and like nothing you've ever seen before. Imagine your favorite childhood fairy tale -- ""Peter Pan,"" ""Cinderella,"" or ""Robin Hood."" Now subvert it with cross-dressing, topical references, audience participation, big song and dance routines, and you've pretty much got the idea. Small stage, big names . But wait. What's this? Recently panto has been getting a celebrity makeover. Once the realm of local actors, now international stars are getting involved. Henry Winkler, better known as ""The Fonz,"" from TV show ""Happy Days,"" and David Hasselhoff, better known as, er, ""The Hoff,"" are wearing Renaissance wigs, badly drawn mustaches, and 45 kilograms of embroidered velvet as they bring to life one of the most infamous panto characters of all -- Hook. ""For me, there's no other part,"" said 68-year-old Winkler, who has been playing the Peter Pan villain since 2006, resurrecting him again at London's Richmond Theater this year. ""All of a sudden you just hear the tiniest voice on the planet either yelling 'Booooo' or 'Peter! He's behind yoooouuu.' Then when Peter is banishing me from Neverland you hear this voice go 'Yay!' and I turn to where it's coming from and say 'Well, I didn't like you much either.' It's just great."" Read this: Step inside master clown's fairy tale home . And it's true, one of the great joys of panto is seeing the audience erupt with lines that have been passed down through generations; youngsters standing on their seats to yell ""Oh yes he is!"" while parents laugh at the sexual innuendo flying just above their heads. ""It's not the kind of theater-going experience where you have to sit still and shut up and feel that you have to be very educated to understand,"" said professor Katherine Newey, chair in theater history at the University of Exeter. ""I think one of the joys of seeing it with children is that you've got an excuse to be a child again."" English eccentricity . Not even Queen Elizabeth is immune to the magic of panto, with a treasure trove of old photos recently revealing she wore her own curly wig when she played the male lead of Prince Florizel in a palace production of ""Cinderella"" in 1941. Swimming in lace ruffles and silk knickerbockers, the then-15-year-old Elizabeth starred opposite her 11-year-old sister Margaret -- who took the title role. ""It's the one opportunity for us to let our hair down,"" said Newey. ""It seems like this weird, eccentrically British thing -- so of course we keep doing it because part of our national self-image is taking delight in being a bit odd and eccentric. ""Yes, the pantomime dame is a man dressed as a woman. Yes, the princip boy, the hero, that's a woman dressed up in tights and knee-high boots, slapping her thigh. Obviously."" Happy Days . And then there's the larger-than-life villain. Enter The Fonz. ""Everyone who is 35-and-up recognizes me from 'Happy Days,' said Winkler, today a grandfather-of-three. ""And they can call me The Fonz all they want because they have also gone with me on my journey -- I've never been restricted in my career by it,"" adds the man who tells me that over his career he's produced 19 years of TV series if you watched them back-to-back, and in 2011 received an Order of the British Empire for his work with dyslexic children after also suffering from the condition. Read this: 342 takes for one movie scene . The native New Yorker admits he never heard of panto before getting involved. But now he's, ahem, hooked. ""It's the story of Peter Pan with Vaudeville in the middle -- it's like chocolate candy with this delicious melted syrup in the center,"" said Winkler. ""As Hook, I'm wearing about 100 pounds of velvet, I'm wearing a King James wig with curls down to my shoulders, I'm wearing a hat. If you don't make that animated, you will get swallowed up and then I would just be lost. So the movement is very calculated. It's a very important part of bringing the character to life."" Rich tradition . Today, panto is seen as a uniquely Christmas tradition, but it wasn't always the case. ""Pantomime as we know it now really emerges in the second half of the 19th century,"" said Newey. ""The original pantomimes had an opening scene, generally a fairy tale, with characters which wore these big masks and were often quite satirical of contemporary politics or events."" When Victorian writer Charles Dickens began writing about Christmas and pantomime, the two became cemented in the national psyche, with panto even spreading to other Commonwealth nations. And with many Britons having Boxing Day -- December 26 -- off work, it became an ideal time of year to enjoy the show. With The Fonz and The Hoff now tackling panto, does that finally make it cool? ""I never knew it wasn't,"" says Winkler.","Cross-dressing, audience participation, dance routines. It's got to be ""panto""

"(CNN) -- Google has revealed a prototype of its latest driverless car -- and this one doesn't even have a steering wheel. The car will only have a stop and go button. No steering wheel. No pedals. Unlike Google's previous self-driving vehicles, which have been based on conventional cars adapted to navigate around without a driver, this model has been designed from scratch. ""They won't have a steering wheel, accelerator pedal, or brake pedal... because they don't need them,"" Google said in a statement. The car can carry two passengers and has a maximum speed of 25 miles per hour. Google says the car's most important feature is its safety. ""They have sensors that remove blind spots, and they can detect objects out to a distance of more than two football fields in all directions, which is especially helpful on busy streets with lots of intersections,"" the company said. With its front designed to look like a friendly smiley face, the Google autonomous car is not just efficient and futuristic, but also cute to look at. Google said it planned to build around 100 prototypes, which it will start testing in a few months. The company started developing its self-driving cars in 2005, and is testing previous models across the U.S. They are expected to be available to buy by 2020.

"(CNN) -- The battle for men's tennis supremacy in 2012 will boil down to the U.S. Open at Flushing Meadows, according to former world number one Jim Courier. The American Davis Cup captain has watched the world's top players at close quarters this year and believes there is nothing to divide Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic, Wimbledon winner Roger Federer and Olympic gold medalist Andy Murray. Rafael Nadal would also come into that category, but the French Open champion will miss the New York event with a knee injury which also prevented him taking part at London 2012. ""The winner of the final slam of the season will have added a second major title to their record and can justifiably claim to be No.1,"" Courier told CNN's Open Court ahead of Monday's opening matches at the two-week hard-court tournament. The four-time grand slam champion said Murray's Olympic triumph in the men's singles this month, when where he beat Federer in straight sets in the final, had elevated him to the same status as the other three. ""It used to be three and a half, now it's the big four,"" Courier said. ""Murray has momentum with him and has been unbelievably consistent."" But when pressed to predict the winner in New York, Courier opted for defending champion Djokovic, believing he can return to the form which saw him totally dominate in 2011 ""and on his best surface."" The Serbian started his North American hard court swing by easily retaining his Toronto Masters crown where he beat Richard Gasquet in straight sets in the final. He can't reclaim the No. 1 ranking from Federer even if he wins the September 8 final, but it would set him up for the end-of-year honors ahead of November's ATP World Tour Finals. Murray upbeat about U.S. Open despite crashing in Cincinnati . World No. 4 Murray won his opening match in Canada but then withdrew with a knee injury, and suffered a shock early exit in Cincinnati as he failed to defend his title. With Federer also in superb form, thrashing Djokovic in the Cincinnati final, Courier cannot see outside the top three seeds. But he nominated 2009 champion Juan Martin Del Potro, who took Olympic bronze at Wimbledon, French world No. 6 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and John Isner, who has performed heroics in the U.S. march to the semifinals of the Davis Cup, as dangerous outsiders. ""You would not have any of those in your part of the draw,"" he said. For Courier, who won two Australian Opens and two French Open crowns, the choice of women's champion is easier. ""Serena Williams,"" said the 42-year-old, who lost in the finals of the 1991 U.S Open and Wimbledon two years later. ""She played ridiculously well in the Olympics."" Wimbledon champion Williams will be bidding for her fourth U.S. Open crown and 15th grand slam title, but she surprisingly lost to Australian Samantha Stosur in last year's final when looking similarly invincible. She also slipped up in the WTA event in Cincinnati this month with a quarterfinal loss to Angelique Kerber -- her first defeat since exiting early at the French Open in June. After the U.S. Open, Courier will take the U.S. team to Gijon to face Davis Cup champions Spain as the Americans bid to reach the final for the first time since 2007. They thrashed Federer's Switzerland team 5-0 in February and beat Tsonga's France 3-2 in April. ""We're not going to beat the Spaniards -- but we weren't going to beat the Swiss or the French either,"" Courier said. ""You look on paper at our matches this year -- away, on clay, against great teams -- we should be playing a relegation match now rather than the semifinals. ""The Bryan brothers, they've won everything, done everything. Isner's been a real threat to everyone he's played in Davis Cup and Mardy Fish came up big for us in Switzerland with a singles win and doubles win. We've put together a true team effort."" Courier will be taking on some of the finest tennis players in modern history in the 12-city Powershare Champions Series that he helped create. John McEnroe, Andre Agassi, Jimmy Connors and Michael Chang will be among the big names taking part in a whistlestop tour of the U.S. from mid October to the end of November.","U.S. Open next month pivotal in deciding player of year in 2012 .

"(CNN) -- With his quicksilver speed and ability to score breathtaking tries, Carlin Isles is blessed with a god-given talent. But the ""fastest man in world rugby"" is looking for divine inspiration as he weighs up the most difficult decision of his life. Isles is a standout for America's rugby sevens team, which is one of the sport's growing forces and has a realistic chance of qualifying for its Olympic debut in Rio in 2016. But he is also being courted by the NFL -- after training with the Detroit Lions he has signed a practice contract, the first step towards gaining a full-time place on the roster. So ultimately Isles will have to choose. Either a shot at Olympic gold or the chance to earn untold riches as a wide receiver or running back in American football. The 24-year-old from Ohio professes to be not influenced by money, but told CNN that he is being guided the power of prayer in making the toughest of choices. ""When it comes down to the Olympics vs. the NFL I have to choose wherever God wants me to go,"" he says. ""I have to listen to my heart and do things for the right reasons."" Isles' value to the American Eagles squad was no more apparent than at the HSBC Las Vegas Sevens last weekend, where his electrifying pace helped the United States team to win the Shield competition with a 31-0 rout of Spain to finish ninth overall. He suggested after the tournament that Vegas might have been his last sevens outing, but he has been included in the U.S. team for this weekend's event in Wellington, New Zealand. A former collegiate track and field star with a personal best of 10.13 for the 100 meters and the ability to run 40 yards in 4.2 seconds, he is relatively new to rugby union, but since finding a spot on the American team in 2012 has terrorized the defenses of even the top nations such as New Zealand. Collections of his best tries have gone viral on YouTube, but may also have alerted the scouts from gridiron that a very special talent was under their noses. Lions impressed . As well as his track and field exploits, Carlin played college football as a wide receiver for Ashland University, a NCAA Division II school, and did enough in his week with Detroit to persuade them to take a further look at him as he signed a reserve/futures contract on January 10. ""When I went there to train it was a lot different. There's a lot of rest time, I can tell you that much,"" he says. ""They were impressed with my stamina and very impressed with my speed, I must say, which is a big key. ""But for me, my work ethic and my stamina from playing rugby sevens played a big factor."" While clearly flattered to have the chance to play in one of the most lucrative sporting leagues in the world, the dilemma for Isles is there for all to see. ""Even thinking about it I've been stressed,"" he admits. ""You know because it's a big decision, both of them are both blessings because rugby has been the biggest blessing to me in my life and I love rugby to death. ""To juggle the two is going to be a little difficult, but I thank God I have the ability to focus and always stay hungry."" Ultimate goal . Under young coach Matt Hawkins, the American squad has been training full-time at the U.S. Olympic facility in San Diego with a constant reminder of the history and tradition of the Summer Games. Every day the drive through the gates with the Olympic rings above acts as a prompt of the importance of the ultimate goal and Isles knows that the 2016 Games is getting ever closer -- almost within touching distance. ""Yeah it's coming up fast because this season is almost over and then 2015's about to come, so two years is going to come quick,"" Isles acknowledges. By a quirk of Games history, the United States, hardly a rugby superpower in the intervening years, would be defending the title it won back in 1924 in Paris when rugby was last part of the Olympic program. Then it was the full 15-a-side game, but when the IOC voted to reintroduce rugby for the Summer Games, it opted for the seven-a-side version of the game. With less players on a big pitch, players with the pace and trickery of Isles are literally worth their weight in gold and it offers nations such as the United States the chance to compete on more equal terms with the likes of world champions New Zealand and other traditional powers such as Australia, South Africa and England. Calendar clash . Hawkins has gone on record to say he will support Isles whatever he ultimately chooses to do with his talents. ""We understand that we can't hold on to everyone, and for some people our program is a stepping stone to other goals and achievements,"" Hawkins told CNN. ""We have enjoyed our time with Carlin and wish him all the very best for his new venture and we will be watching closely to see how he progresses."" If his star player does eventually make the breakthrough to the NFL, the calendars of the respective sports will collide -- the HSBC Sevens World Series stretches from October to May. ""If I end up choosing just to do football, of course I won't be able to play as many tournaments and basically I'd have to focus on football,"" Isles admits. ""I'm just trying to work out things and figure out what's going to be the best for me."" Lions coach Jim Caldwell will be hoping the gamble of his sacked predecessor Jim Schwartz on the slight but lightning quick Isles -- who at 5 foot 8 inches (1.72 meters) and 159 pounds (72 kg) would be dwarfed by some of imposing physiques in the NFL -- does indeed provide a winning return. For Eagles coach Hawkins, ahead of next year's Olympic qualifying program where Canada is likely the main opposition for a place in Rio, the decision Isles eventually makes could also influence his future. ""The door is always open for Carlin,"" he said.","Carlin Isles is one of the stars of the HSBC Sevens World Series .

"(CNN) -- The simmering warfare and political instability in Iraq are probably far from over, and U.S. military involvement there could very well last years beyond the end of 2011 -- when all U.S. troops are scheduled to depart the war-torn nation, analysts who study Iraq say. Think-tank analysts who've written about what's next in Iraq after the U.S. combat mission formally ends Tuesday say economic and infrastructure conditions need to be improved. And, they envision a persistent American presence in an Iraq that remains unstable -- despite many improvements in the country's security forces and political culture. While U.S. and Iraqi officials point out that violence there has dropped, the attacks, like the wave of coordinated strikes across Iraq last week, will continue, they say. ""The Iraq War is not over and it is not 'won,' "" wrote Anthony Cordesman, who holds the Arleigh A. Burke Chair in Strategy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Iraq still faces a serious insurgency, and deep ethnic and sectarian tensions."" Analysts say a unified government is key to stability in Iraq and the failure of lawmakers to form a new government after the March 7 national elections could exacerbate violence. Manal Omar, director of Iraq programs of the U.S. Institute of Peace, said the ""primary fear"" people have with the U.S. combat mission ending is that ""political parties will resort to violence to force alliances in power sharing"" and ""the Iraqi citizens will pay the price."" U.S. and Iraqi officials point out that troops could remain past the end of 2011 if the Iraqi government requests a new deployment and both countries agree. Michael O'Hanlon, a Brookings Institution senior fellow who spearheads the organization's Iraq Index, says a full removal of Americans troops by the end of next year would be a tall order. He said ""too many sectarian wounds"" are ""unhealed"" and there are ""unresolved"" disputes -- like the territorial fight between Arabs, Kurds, and Turkomens around Kirkuk. ""Pulling all of our remaining troops out of Iraq by the end of 2011, as presently required under a U.S.-Iraqi understanding negotiated by President (George W.) Bush and Prime Minister (Nuri al-) Maliki in late 2008, seems too risky,"" O'Hanlon wrote in an article in The National Interest. ""Our calming presence is useful, as Iraqis themselves agreed in a recent poll by a considerable margin, and there is no military or strategic need to rush for the exits."" O'Hanlon also said that any ""renegotiation"" of the December 31, 2011 date "" requires a new Iraqi government -- and there is no sign of one emerging."" Noah Feldman, an adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former senior adviser to the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq, wrote a column for the Wall Journal that said ""Iraq faces a raft of difficulties if it is to become an effective, self-governing nation, and all of them point to the need for a continuing U.S. role in security and beyond."" He noted that the U.S. troop surge blocked setbacks, such as civil war, and that only the United States ""can offer a credible guarantee"" that the government ""is not about to collapse."" ""This is the reason that many observers, including Ryan Crocker, former U.S. ambassador to Iraq, expect Iraq's elected leaders to ask for troops past the planned pull-out target,"" Feldman wrote. He said Iraq's politicians have the most to lose from the pullout. ""The cost to Iraqi politicians of asking the former occupier to stick around is likely to be offset by the tremendous gains in public confidence associated with a prolonged American commitment -- especially if they ask early in their own election cycle,"" Feldman said. Feldman said the situation in Iraq is similar to South Korea, where the United States left troops after the 1953 armistice for stability and security. There are nearly 30,000 U.S. troops in South Korea almost 60 years after the end of the Korean War, he said. He said the United States was in South Korea when it ""was governed by a succession of military dictators"" and into the 1980s as South Korea ""blossomed into a free and functioning democracy."" ""In the coming year, the Iraqi government (once it is formed) is likely to ask the U.S. to keep some significant number of troops in the country after the pullout date of summer 2011. If so, President Obama may well agree, because it is just about the only way to avoid a resurgence of civil war and continue Iraq's tenuous progress toward consolidating democracy,"" Feldman said. Iraq is known for its oil wealth and the U.S. Department of Energy projects oil production will expand into 2035. But Cordesman said that despite the oil industry, Iraq's ""economy is one of the poorest in the world in terms of real per capita income."" ""It is the second year of a budget crisis that has force it to devote most state funds to paying salaries and maintaining employment at the cost of both development and creating effective security forces,"" Cordesman said. The 30 years or so of conflict in Iraq has taken its toll, Cordesman said, and ""it will be years before Iraq can overcome"" their effect. ""Moreover, the bulk of a massive international aid effort has either been wasted or consumed in dealing with the insurgency, and aid is phasing down to critically low levels at a time Iraq lacks both the funds and capability to replace aid or even take transfer of many aid projects."" Rachel Schneller, a U.S. Foreign Service officer who is now a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, in an essay for Chatham House, cautions any United States withdrawal from Iraq must be responsible and added that ""getting the country electrified"" would be a key stride. ""Nothing would stabilize Iraq more than reliable electricity, which would allow business growth and employment of those who might otherwise join militias to support their families,"" she wrote. Cordesman said Iraq in the future can be an asset in the region. It can help limit Iran's influence, divide Iran and Syria, give Turkey a ""key alternative to economic involvement with Iran, and ""play a key role in securing the entire Gulf."" ""The fact remains, however, that Iraq is a truly vital national security interest of the United States, and of all its friends and allies,"" he said.","Political stability is important for Iraq, analysts agree .

"(CNN) -- When the HMS Birkenhead, a British ship carrying troops, began to sink off the coast of South Africa in 1852, the captain and military officers on board famously allowed women and children to board the lifeboats first. The captain and many of the troops stayed on the ship until the last, perishing in the ocean as the women and children made their way to safety. Their chivalrous act of self-sacrifice is considered to have helped set the standard for noble conduct at sea. Other displays of courage by captains and crew members who put their passengers first have punctuated the decades since, like Capt. Edward J. Smith who went down with the Titanic. But such bravery has been conspicuously absent from two major maritime disasters in recent times. Capt. Lee Joon-seok of the Sewol, the South Korean ferry that sunk last week, has come under heavy criticism for abandoning the ship while hundreds of passengers remained on board. Dozens of them died and more than 200 were still missing Monday. Lee's actions have prompted comparisons to those of Capt. Francesco Schettino who was in command of the cruise ship Costa Concordia, which crashed into a reef off the Italian coast in 2012, killing 32 people. Witnesses said Schettino jumped into a lifeboat to flee the ship, even though hundreds of passengers were still on board. In his trial, the captain said he fell into a lifeboat when the ship listed sharply. Schettino is now on trial on charges of manslaughter, causing a maritime disaster and abandoning ship with passengers still on board. He denies wrongdoing. The cases of the Sewol and the Costa Concordia have raised questions about a captain's obligations to passengers when a vessel runs into trouble. Go down with ship? By leaving the Sewol soon after it began sinking, Lee reneged on some of his key duties, experts say. ""The captain's first obligation is for the safety of his crew and passengers,"" Capt. James Staples, a maritime consultant, told CNN. ""He should stay on board that vessel until he knows everybody is safely evacuated. ""And then the other reason he stays on board the vessel is for salvage rights. For the captain to leave the vessel in an early situation, it's not the way it should be done."" An international maritime convention on the safety of life at sea makes a captain responsible for the vessel and all the people on board, but it doesn't stipulate that the captain stay on the ship throughout the crisis. ""You don't necessarily want a captain dying with a ship. But he has a responsibility for the safety of everybody on board that ship,"" said Cade Courtley, former Navy SEAL and president and founder of SEAL Survival. ""He's got to be there and take care of that,"" Courtley told CNN. ""And this guy didn't do that. He was one of the first off. I mean, that's kind of unforgivable, basically."" Murky waters cloud horror facing divers . Criminal charges . Some countries, including Italy and South Korea, make abandoning ship a maritime crime. And similarly to Schettino in Italy, Lee is facing criminal charges over his role in the disaster, including abandoning his ship, negligence, causing bodily injury and not seeking rescue from other ships. South Korean President Park Geun-hye has likened the actions of Lee and some of the ferry's crew members to murder. Schettino and Lee are not alone in leaving a doomed ship before their passengers, though. As well as the role of honor for captains who went down with their vessels, there is hall of shame for those who jumped ship. In one example, the Italian steamer Sirio was wrecked off the Spanish coast in 1906, killing more than 150 people. Its captain was reported to have abandoned the ship at the first opportunity, but he died the following year of ""a broken heart"" according to a report in The New York Times. Delayed evacuation . Lee has drawn particular criticism for apparently ordering passengers to delay the evacuation of the Sewol as it foundered. ""The captain should have been passing honest and clear information on to everyone as to the situation, not telling them to just sit,"" said William Doherty, a retired captain with the U.S. Merchant Marines. Lee has defended his actions. ""It is a fairly fast current area, and the water temperature was cold,"" he said, according to local media. ""I thought that abandoning the ship without discretion would make you drift off a fairly far distance and cause a lot of trouble. At the same time, the rescue ship did not come, and there were no fishing boats or supporting ships around to help at that time."" Anguish amplified by misinformation . Leadership vacuum . Lee's early departure may have exacerbated the crisis on board the ship, said Doherty, who teaches safety management at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy. ""When the leadership cuts and runs, it leaves a vacuum that is almost impossible to fill,"" he told CNN. ""There should have been crewmembers going to the life raft stations. There should have been crew members mustering the passengers. So you know your head count. If there are missing people, there should have been other crew members searching the vessel to find those people."" Although U.S. law doesn't specify abandoning ship as a crime, it's a long-standing tradition that the captain be the last one off a sinking ship, according to legal experts. ""Generally speaking, the captain is the last person to get off that vessel,"" Staples said. 'Safer than any other vehicle' He cautioned, though, that not all the details have emerged of Lee's actions during the crucial moments on the Sewol. ""We don't know if the coast guard demanded him to get off at that time,"" he said. ""They may have been alongside and told the captain he had to get off at that time. We're not sure what happened there."" Lee appears to have been confident of his ability to ensure the safety of passengers in the past. In a promotional video from 2010, he is pictured in the wheelhouse of a ship, looking out to sea through binoculars. He praises the security a ship provides to its passengers. ""I believe it is safer than any other vehicle,"" he says, ""as long as they follow the instructions of our crew members.""","Captains should stay on board until everybody is safe, experts say .

"Panama City, Panama (CNN) -- Four days have passed since Panamanian authorities discovered undeclared military weapons hidden aboard a North Korean ship, and the painstaking process of examining the entire vessel is crawling at a snail's pace. The ship has five cargo holds, only one of which has been emptied as of Thursday. ""The technicians on board have told us that this cargo was loaded in a way that makes it difficult to unload,"" Panamanian Security Minister Jose Raul Mulino said. The North Korean crew had resisted the Panamanian authorities and cut the cables to the onboard cranes. Panamanian investigators brought their own cranes, but removing the containers inside the cargo holds has been an ""odyssey,"" Mulino said. The ship originated in Cuba, and the Cubans have admitted to owning the military equipment, claiming it was being sent to North Korea to be repaired and returned. But many questions remain. If the weapons were not a secret, why were they hidden under sacks of sugar? Why the did the captain attempt to commit suicide? A public prosecutor is charging the captain and 35 North Korean crew members with illegal possession of weapons and international arms trafficking, Panamanian government spokesman Eduardo Camacho said. North Korean officials, meanwhile, asked for Panama to release the cargo ship and let the crew go. Panama has formally asked the United Nations for guidance on how to handle the case. ""For us, it is important to finish this operation, wait for the United Nations to come, and they will decide"" how to proceed, Mulino said. ""Panama is completely transparent in this; we have no experience in dealing with this type of problem."" Because it is pursuing nuclear weapons, North Korea is banned by the United Nations from importing and exporting most weapons. Scene at the port . At the port of Manzanillo, inspectors opened shipping containers in front of reporters. Heavily armed troops stand guard. In the first cargo hold, six shipping containers were found underneath sacks of brown sugar, in two stacks of three. The tops of some of the containers were caved in because of the weight of the sugar. Inside the containers lies the military equipment. Inspectors walked inside the containers, taking pictures. Cuban officials have described the materiel as ""240 metric tons of obsolete defensive weapons"" sent to North Korea ""to be repaired and returned to Cuba."" The equipment was manufactured in the mid-20th century and included two anti-aircraft missile systems, nine missiles in parts and spares, two MiG-21 jets and 15 motors for this type of airplane, the Cuban foreign ministry said. U.S. involved in investigation . The United States and Panama had been tracking the ship as it crossed the Panama Canal to Cuba and then back, two U.S. officials said. And a U.S. State Department spokeswoman said Wednesday that the United States would help in the investigation. The Panamanians asked the United States for imaging equipment and technicians to fully examine the boat and determine what is on board, according to a U.S. official who declined to be identified because the person was not authorized to speak publicly. Speculation has surged since Panama announced its find, with some warning that it was a troubling sign of weapons deals between North Korea and Cuba, and others disputing whether any dangers lay within the antiquated haul. Cuba says the weapons are ""obsolete."" And experts who identified early Cold War relics such as the Soviet-designed SA-2 air defense system among the ship's cargo say that's not far from the truth. ""Today there is no reason for any Western pilot to be hit by an SA-2. If you get caught by one of them, you've done something bloody stupid, or you've got very bad luck,"" said James O'Halloran, editor of Jane's Land Based Air Defence and Jane's Strategic Weapon Systems. ""No modern country wants to be seen with those."" But others saw the weapons haul as a more ominous sign. In a letter to U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a frequent critic of the Cuban government, described the weapons shipment as a ""flagrant violation of multiple United Nations Security Council Resolutions."" CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet in Atlanta and journalist May Lee in Panama contributed to this report.","NEW: Captain, crew face weapons trafficking charges .

"(CNN) -- The champagne wishes and caviar dreams of the person in Indiana holding April's winning Powerball ticket will officially remain just those -- wishes and dreams, if not a nightmare -- after failing to claim their $1 million prize. Indiana's 180-day window for lottery winners to come forward came to a close Monday for the unlucky soul who purchased the lucky ticket in the April 10 drawing at the Circle K in Jeffersonville. ""It is rare, but not unheard of, that a prize of such magnitude goes unclaimed,"" Indiana Lottery spokeswoman Stephanie McFarland said. When it comes to ""unclaimed magnitude,"" whoever missed out can at least take solace in the fact they didn't set a record for being the biggest loser among gambling Hoosiers: In 2002, someone in Indiana missed out on a $50 million Powerball jackpot, McFarland said. Absentminded lottery players can provide big boosts for state coffers, because unclaimed prize money is retained by the state. Chuck Strutt of the Multi-State Lottery Association told CNNMoney in a recent article that $800 million in lottery winnings went unclaimed nationwide in 2011. McFarland told CNN that the state makes no special effort -- such as reviewing Circle K's surveillance tape -- to try to figure out who this, or any other ""winner,"" is.

"(CNN) -- For 20 years, the warts studding Dede Kosawa's hands and feet multiplied and sprouted like gnarled roots. Doctors believe Dede Kosawa's unusual appearance occurred because of a immune defect and HPV. His hands looked like contorted, yellow-brown branches extending 3 feet. Unable to clamp his hands into a fist or pick up a fork, he made his living by performing in carnivals in rural Indonesia. He became known as the Treeman. ""His life was taken away from him,"" said Dr. Anthony Gaspari, an American dermatologist who traveled twice to Indonesia to treat Kosawa. ""He was severely disfigured and was sent into a rural isolated village where he was sheltered from his peers. With good reason, he was a sad man. He wanted to be cured and he wanted hope."" The growths encrusting his arms accounted for nearly 12 pounds of his 100-pound body. Kosawa, 36, often became exhausted after taking a few steps because of the dense warts on his feet. The growths that carpeted his limbs were posing more problems. ""He was getting infected,"" said Gaspari, chief of dermatology at the University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland. ""He had insects living in the base of the wood-like material."" Doctors believe that Kosawa's case was a perfect storm, created by a genetically inherited immune defect and a type of human papillomavirus, or HPV. Kosawa told doctors that the warts started appearing after getting a cut in his skin as a teenager. There are hundreds of types of  HPV, some of which are linked to cervical cancer and others that cause common warts that can be acquired through cuts. ""The HPV-2 virus that causes common warts is the same exact wart virus that he's infected with, except it was growing out of control,"" Gaspari said. Kosawa has a deficiency of white blood cells, which are crucial in fighting infections, and his weakened immune system couldn't fight the HPV. The virus hijacked his skin cells, causing it to produce massive amounts of keratin, a protein found in hair and fingernails.  The warts sprouted into dense growths known medically as ""cutaneous horns"" on his hands and feet. ""I had never seen anything this severe,"" said Gaspari, a dermatologist for 25 years. ""I shared this case with my colleagues, and no one had ever seen this before."" He became involved in Kosawa's case after being approached by a dermatology journal and Discovery Health Channel. His travels to Indonesia are chronicled in the channel's documentaries and the second chapter, ""Treeman: Search for the Cure,"" which  premieres Sunday on Discovery Health. Earlier in his life, Kosawa sought help from local doctors, who followed the prescribed treatment by removing the warts. ""It grew back after the operation,"" he says in the documentary. ""It grew back faster."" The skin treatments didn't work, because they didn't address his weakened immune system, and Kosawa could not afford more medical procedures, Gaspari said. ""Here's a man with chronic immune defect that had bad wart virus that went untreated for 20 years,"" he said. ""In an industrialized country, this individual would have come to the attention of the health care system and would have interventions that would prevent it from progressing. That's the reason why it developed into an extremely bizarre, unusual appearance."" As Kosawa aged, his condition worsened. The horns clustered on his limbs, where the body temperature is lower. They grew at a rate of 5 millimeters a month. Warts that looked like barnacles began to clump around his eyes and nose. ""I am afraid that it will cover all my face,"" Kosawa told an Indonesian journalist. ""I won't be able to see. I won't be able to eat."" The growing of the warts was not painful, Gaspari said.  But the cutaneous horns were attached to the skin, and Kosawa would feel pain if they were pulled or entangled. As the growths took over his hands and feet, Kosawa lost his independence, and his wife left him. He had worked in construction and fishing but could not longer work. Kosawa's siblings and parents cared for him, feeding and cleaning him. His condition is not contagious, and his family members have not been infected with similar skin growths. ""He has a wonderful family,"" Gaspari said. ""That's why he was able to survive as long as he did."" To support his two teenage children, Kosawa joined a traveling performance group with people who have various skin deformities. ""I try to be a good father, but I can't give them what they need,"" he said in the documentary.""I feel sad, because I cannot touch them."" Similar cases of uncontrollable wart growths have been reported in China and Romania. In 2007, Chinese researchers reported two unrelated male patients who developed cutaneous horns on their limbs. Both patients had the same type of HPV infections, according to studies. In 2007, as word spread about Kosawa's condition, he was brought into an Indonesian hospital for treatment. About 12 pounds of cutaneous horns were sawed from his hands and feet. Skin grafts were taken from his back and buttocks and placed on his forearm. Gaspari often disagreed with the Indonesian doctors' procedures such the skin grafts, saying it was invasive and could be infected with the virus. After several surgeries, Kosawa has been able to walk, lift a fork and write. He was discharged from the hospital in early September. The warts have been reappearing, but Kosawa is receiving chemotherapy to stop the virus. Gaspari continues to monitor Kosawa's progress through e-mails and teleconference calls with Indonesian doctors. ""You can see the outlines of his hands,"" Gaspari said. ""It's still covered in warts. Before, you couldn't tell the top from the bottom. He has definitely made progress and gained some weight."" The experts are waiting to learn more about Kosawa's reaction to the medical treatments, Gaspari said. ""The story has not fully unfolded yet.""","A man from rural Indonesia cuts his skin as a teenager and develops warts .

"(CNN) -- As a mother, you send your children off to their first day of kindergarten with pride, anticipation and excitement. But a part of you can't shake those nagging questions: Will they make friends? Have someone to play with at recess? Be bullied? As director of PACER's National Center for Bullying Prevention, and the mother of a child with Down syndrome, those questions don't just go away with time. And that worry only intensifies. My 14-year-old son, David, was born with Down syndrome. Before he turned 3, he had undergone three open heart surgeries and a tracheotomy, and his breathing required a ventilator. Heading into kindergarten, David was nonverbal, had delayed cognitive abilities and received his nutrition from a feeding tube. There was no doubt about it: My son wasn't like his peers. Because of his differences -- and research showing children tend to single out peers with characteristics like his -- I feared that David could become a poster child for children expected to be the targets of bullying. We live in a small community, where David has known all of his classmates since kindergarten and will eventually graduate high school with most of them. They have the same classes, eat lunch at the same time and attend field trips together. For all of these reasons, I decided the best way to address my concerns about David would be to become his advocate -- not only with adults, but with his peers. During his first year of school, I started visiting David's classroom to talk with his classmates about Down syndrome. I discovered that most children weren't concerned about his cognitive issues; they were actually more fascinated with why he didn't talk. At this time, I also networked with his teachers, his paraprofessionals and even made sure the lunchroom workers knew me. I hoped the more these people felt comfortable with me, the more information they would share. Now, years later, David has just started the eighth grade. He's not bullied, and more than that, he loves school. It's the place where his peers give him high fives in the hallway, ask him to sit by them at lunch and -- best of all -- genuinely accept him. I have been David's advocate, but I can't take all, or even most, of the credit for David's acclimating so well to school. That credit belongs to his teachers, school staff and classmates, particularly a group of students who received training in sixth grade on how to prevent bullying and speak out on David's behalf. We call them his peer advocates, and if they see bullying, they intervene, ask the bully to stop or report the situation to an adult. The concept sounds simple, but because my son can't tell me what happens during the day, I depend heavily on these peers to act as his voice. Now, what started as four kids in sixth grade has evolved to a schoolwide project with more than 40 students volunteering to become peer advocates so they can help David and other students who are different. I know all too well that not every parent of a child with a disability has this good fortune. Although I've found that power comes from sharing and being direct, I realize this approach won't work in every classroom where bullying exists. But there are always ways that parents, teachers and students can develop strategies and begin to teach young people the importance of inclusion, acceptance and -- most important -- respect. The act of bullying hurts not only the children involved, but the entire community. That's why PACER Center has organized National Bullying Prevention Month in October, a time for communities nationwide to unite and promote bullying prevention through creative resources designed to engage, educate and inspire. Ignoring the problem is not the answer. Instead, our communities can take steps to raise awareness of bullying and start teaching young people that the end of bullying really does begin with them. Bullying has affected too many for too long. But there is hope. Hope for the teachers who want bullying to end. Hope for the students too afraid to go to school. And hope for the mothers and fathers of children with disabilities -- that one day, they will drop off their children on the first day of kindergarten without having to worry about whether they will be bullied. Instead, they can expect their children will be included and respected by their peers for everything they are. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julie Hertzog.","National Center for Bullying Prevention's Julie Hertzog feared for Down syndrome son .

"(CNN) -- For Poland's National Ballet, the present no longer means reveling in the fleet-footed legends of past stage glories. Instead, the focus is on creating a program as international and challenging as that of any major company on the planet. The country's national ballet has been up and running since April 2009 (when it was given artistic autonomy within the existing structures of the Teatr Wielki ""Grand Theater"" in Warsaw), pushing out exciting new works and stage shows to wide acclaim. Polish ballet's reputation has subsequently been given a new lease of life and the company's output has been positively received. See also: Why you should get to know Polish literature . At the helm of this transformation is Krzysztof Pastor, a globally renowned choreographer from Gdansk, northern Poland. Pastor returned to the land of his birth from the Netherlands -- where he still holds a post as a resident choreographer at the Dutch National Ballet -- to take up the post of director when the new company was formed. ""For everyone in Poland, not only for ballet dancers but also in other jobs, you know one has to be innovative, creative,"" Pastor explained. ""That's the importance of art. We should be sort of avant-garde (with) this creativity and innovation,"" he added. Representing modern Poland . Pastor's mission is to create a dance company that reflects Poland's rebirth after a turbulent century of wars, occupations and repression. According to the Teatr Wielki, ballet has played a prominent role in Polish culture since as far back as the 16th century when the first choreographed displays began appearing in the country's royal courts. During the romantic period of the 19th century, the Warsaw Ballet was even considered one Europe's leading ensembles. But Poland's traumatic experiences in the 20th century meant a lower output than in previous generations on the ballet front: not anymore. See also: Polish street art goes large . ""Somebody asked me what I think and how the company should be in the future,"" Pastor said. ""I think it should reflect the society, you know, with ambitions."" Attracting international talent . With scores of dancers and productions, the complex artistic operation is far from a one-man-show. But according to prima ballerina Marta Feidler the potential of this dance company could only have been fulfilled with Pastor's homecoming. ""We were really happy because we felt that it was really (an) opportunity for us to change something from the old years, when everything was so strict and closed actually, not opened for the world. ""So he (Pastor) changed a lot of things of thinking, of showing the dancers how it's supposed to work,"" she added. Part of being open and creative means the national ballet is now an international company and a place where people from outside Poland want to dance and work. See also: Explore Poland's majestic cultural heritage . For Pastor, this means attracting the best talent to Poland from around the world. ""Our mission is to go outside and show that we are a young, dynamic, innovative and creative company. I think I have accomplished something but I'm also aware that there is still a long way to go,"" he said.","Poland's National Ballet is going from strength to strength .

"(CNN) -- The jury weighing the fate of a white Florida man accused of killing a black teen during an argument over loud music concluded its second day of deliberations Thursday after asking a judge for details about a letter written in the months after the shooting. The jury was scheduled to resume deliberations Friday at 9 a.m. ET. The question was the latest posed by the jury considering the evidence in the case against Michael Dunn, who says he acted in self-defense when he opened fire on four teenagers in an SUV in Jacksonville in November 2012. Prosecutors contend it was an act of murder. Dunn has been charged with first-degree murder in the killing of 17-year-old Jordan Davis. He also has been charged with three counts of attempted murder. If Dunn is found guilty, he faces up to life in prison. The questions came during the second day of deliberations in a case that has drawn parallels to the trial of George Zimmerman in the killing of teenager Trayvon Martin, which also had racial overtones and claims of self-defense. Jury questions . Among the requests from the jury was to see surveillance video from the gas station where Dunn shot Davis. The video contains 20 minutes of footage from multiple angles, though a shorter version showing only one angle was slated to be shown in court. The jurors posed another question later in the day: ""Can we get that dummy with the sticks?"" -- a reference to a flexible mannequin and three dowels used to demonstrate the angles of the bullets as they entered Davis' body. Judge Russell Healey said he'd grant the request if both the prosecution and defense agreed, but after examining the dummy, defense attorney Cory Strolla said he felt the dowels in the body had been repositioned and objected to the jury seeing it again. Then the jury asked the judge when the letter was written. The answer: June 2013. In closing arguments Wednesday, prosecutors said inconsistencies between Dunn's words and actions undermined his assertion he acted in self-defense when he fatally shot the teen. His attorney countered the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt his client was guilty. He pleaded with jurors to find Dunn not guilty. In testimony Tuesday, Dunn said he fired in self-defense after the teen threatened him with a gun. ""My intent was to stop the attack, not necessarily end a life,"" he said. ""It just worked out that way."" Defendant says he was 'crazy with grief' 'There was no gun' But Assistant State Attorney Erin Wolfson said Wednesday that Dunn's claims don't add up. She noted that Dunn fired 10 shots at the SUV, three of them while the car was fleeing. He never took cover -- but instead opened his car door -- even though he would later tell detectives he had seen a weapon, she said. ""There was no gun,"" Wolfson told jurors. In addition, she said, he did not tell his fiancee, Rhonda Rouer, that he had seen a weapon until more than a month later. Dunn also left the scene of the shooting, went back to a hotel where they were staying and walked his dog, she said. And he returned the next day to his house -- more than two hours away -- all without calling 911, Wolfson said. ""This defendant didn't tell anyone because he thought he had gotten away with murder,"" she said, adding that Dunn had no idea a witness had taken down his tag number. Opinion: Did Florida shooter make his case on the stand? 'Rap crap' Dunn has testified he described the music to his fiancee as ""rap crap."" In the parking lot, as the music blared, ""his blood started to boil; he didn't like the music that was coming out of the car next to him; he got angrier and angrier,"" Wolfson said. Dunn rolled down his window and asked the youths to turn it down, which they did, but then turned it back up, Wolfson said. ""He got angry at the fact that a 17-year-old kid decided not to listen to him,"" she said, adding that Dunn then pulled a 9 mm gun out of his glove box and shot ""systematically and methodically"" at the SUV. ""Nobody denied that Jordan was talking back. But this defendant took it upon himself to silence Jordan Davis forever."" Dunn testified Tuesday that he saw Davis reach down and pick something up, and that he saw about ""4 inches of a barrel"" from a 12- or 20-gauge shotgun above the window. Opinion: Florida shooter saw black, thought 'threat' 'You're not going to kill me' He muttered aloud to himself, "" 'You're not going to kill me, you son of a bitch,' "" as he opened the glove compartment, grabbed his pistol, dropped the holster at his feet, chambered a round and began firing, he said. Nine of the 10 rounds hit the car, and three of them struck Davis, one of them cutting through his liver, his lung and his aorta. Wolfson rejected Dunn's assertion he had been trying to de-escalate the situation and he feared for his life. Strolla, the defense attorney, noted that no witnesses had accused Dunn of using any hate words and testified that his client had just come from a wedding, where his ex-wife said he had appeared to be in a good mood. Strolla noted that the SUV departed the gas station after the shooting and was gone for three minutes before it returned, enough time for the youths to have dumped a gun. Detectives did not search the area for days after the shooting, he said. Strolla cited testimony from another passenger in the car with Davis who acknowledged he may not have heard all the conversation between the two men. 'You have reasonable doubt' Witnesses testified that child locks on the SUV were engaged, and that Davis -- who was seated in the rear -- could not have gotten out of the back seat to threaten Dunn. But Strolla said the teen could simply have opened the door by putting his hand out the window, which was open. ""You have lack of evidence, conflicts of evidence and reasonable doubt,"" he told the jurors. On rebuttal, Assistant State Attorney John Guy appealed to the jurors' ""common sense."" ""That defendant didn't shoot into a car full of kids to save his life,"" he said. ""He shot into it to preserve his pride. Period. That's why we're here."" Though Davis may have had a big mouth, he had no weapon, Guy said. Though he acknowledged minor inconsistencies in witness accounts, he said that was to be expected. ""It's not like television,"" he said. ""In real life, there are inconsistencies."" The court has decided not to release the identifications of the jurors, fearing they could be the subject of threats, but a document obtained by CNN affiliate WTLV-TV in Jacksonville showed the makeup of the jury. It has four white females, two black females, four white males, an Asian female and a Hispanic male, plus four alternates. CNN's Tom Watkins and John Couwels contributed to this report.","NEW: Jury suspends deliberations for the day .

"Khartoum, Sudan (CNN) -- Sudanese police cracked down on protesters Saturday after days of demonstrations against government austerity measures and calls for the president's ouster. The head of Sudan's police force told his officers Saturday how to deal with riots, groups targeting property, and arbitrary road closures by protesters ""in accordance with the laws,"" state television reported. At the same meeting with Gen. Hashim Osman Hussein, police called on residents of Khartoum to ""cooperate with the police in doing its job to enforce the law aimed at securing the homeland and its citizens,"" state TV reported. Growing numbers of protesters have rallied in the capital against government spending cuts and other measures. The protests have in some cases turned violent, with people throwing stones at police, burning tires and police trucks, and cutting off roads. After Friday prayers, crowds called for the toppling of President Omar al-Bashir. ""Leave, Bashir, leave!"" they chanted. ""Khartoum, people, please revolt against humiliation and dictatorship."" Police and security agents intensified their crackdown Saturday, detaining a number of opposition figures and surrounding the buildings of two of the country's main opposition parties. Officers used batons to disperse the demonstrations and police vehicles patrolled throughout the capital. In a televised speech on state media last week, al-Bashir urged citizens to understand the new harsh austerity measures, which lifted fuel subsidies and cut the Cabinet by half to reduce expenses. Sudan has faced soaring inflation since it separated with South Sudan a year ago -- taking with it more than 70% of Sudan's oil reserves. The nation's inflation has gone up by 30%, according to Sudanese Finance Minister Ali Mahmud. Protesters have vowed to hold mass rallies June 30, when the ruling party celebrates 24 years in power. Organizers are also calling for mass action using social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook, where they are posting pictures and details of upcoming protests. The government has described the weeklong protests as small and urged citizens to avoid them. Government officials were not immediately available for comment. In similar protests in January last year, students vowed to replicate the Arab Spring that has swept over the Middle East.","NEW: Police are told how to deal with riots and violence .

"(CNN) -- The parents of a 3-year-old in a ""vegetative state"" are suing a Kailua, Hawaii, dentist, alleging negligence and dangerous conduct that left the girl with massive, irreversible brain damage. The lawsuit filed against Lilly Geyer and her practice, Island Dentistry for Children, alleges improper medications with incorrect dosages were administered to Finley Boyle on December 3, 2013, according to court documents filed this week. ""As a direct and proximate result of the medications administered to (Finley) by defendants, (Finley) suffered cardiac arrest during her dental procedure,"" the lawsuit said. It also alleges that as a further result of administering improper medications, Finley ""suffered severe and permanent brain damage."" Geyer and Geyer's attorney, John Nishimoto, did not respond to repeated requests by CNN for comment. The Island Dentistry website states it has been permanently closed and directs patients to an e-mail address. The lawsuit, filed Monday in Hawaii's First Circuit Court, also alleges Geyer did not have a plan or procedures in place to respond to medical emergencies, such as the one Finley suffered. It seeks unspecified damages. Finley's mother, Ashley Boyle, said she first took her daughter to the dentist in November, when she was told her daughter needed six fillings and four root canals, she said. They returned to the dentist in December to undergo the root canals, Boyle said. The parents allege that Finley was sedated and left unmonitored for 26 minutes. Finley was moved from a hospital to a hospice in late December. ""She will probably not be with us much longer,"" Boyle said. Finley's pediatric neurologist, Dr. Gregory Yen, said the girl has been in a ""persistent vegetative state"" since she was brought to him a month ago. Finley has undergone four MRIs on her brain, which have shown severe damage, the doctor said. It is difficult to say how long Finley will be alive, Yen said.","A lawsuit alleges Finley Boyle, 3, suffered massive brain damage during a dental procedure .

"Washington (CNN) -- A pre-dawn raid by elite U.S. forces in southern Somalia, in the heart of territory controlled by the al Qaeda subsidiary Al-Shabaab, targeted an Al-Shabaab commander connected to one of the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings, a senior Obama administration official said Sunday. The suspected foreign fighter commander is named Ikrima, a Kenyan of Somali origin about whom little is known. The official said Ikrima is associated with two now-deceased al Qaeda operatives who played roles in the 1998 bombing of the U.S. embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, and the 2002 attacks on a hotel and airline in Mombasa, also in Kenya. A recent Kenyan intelligence report alleged that Ikrima was behind several foiled terror conspiracies against targets in Kenya between 2011 and 2013. The most recent was a plot to attack Mandera Airport in Kenya's North Eastern province in April. Kenyan officials said last year that Ikrima had a significant role in recruiting and training Kenyans in Al-Shabaab. He is thought to have been a close associate of Saleh Ali Nabhan, a fellow Kenyan and senior al Qaeda operative in east Africa, who was killed by U.S. forces in 2009 in Somalia. He is thought to have been a close associate of the Saleh Ali Nabhan, a fellow Kenyan and senior al Qaeda operative in east Africa, who was believed to have been connected to the embassy attacks. (Ali Nabhan was killed by U.S. forces in 2009 in Somalia.) Ikrima also appears to be close to Al-Shabaab leader Mukhtar Abu Zubayr, who also goes by Ahmed Abdi Godane. How the raid happened . U.S. Navy SEAL members traveled by sea to reach the coastal villa frequented by top Al-Shabaab commanders, storming the house early Saturday. Until Sunday, no U.S. official disclosed the target of the raid. The SEALs' mission didn't go as planned, however. The U.S. commandos encountered heavy fire and had to withdraw, not knowing whether their target was dead or alive. Al-Shabaab is the U.S.-designated terrorist group that claimed responsibility for last month's siege on a Kenyan shopping mall that killed 67 people. Residents of the port city of Barawe said the home belonged to Al-Shabaab leader Mukhtar Abu Zubayr, also known as Ahmed Abdi Godane. An Al-Shabaab spokesman had said Godane was the target of the attack. The group said one of its fighters was killed in the attack. No SEAL members were killed or hurt, a U.S. official said. It was one of two raids carried out by elite U.S. forces in Africa on Saturday against targets connected to the 1998 embassy bombing in Nairobi. The other was an operation in Tripoli, Libya, by the U.S. Army Delta Force against Abu Anas al Libi, indicted in the United States for helping to plan the Nairobi embassy attack. Delta Force members captured al Libi, who will eventually be taken to New York to face federal charges. In the 2002 attacks, three suicide bombers detonated a car bomb outside the Israeli-owned Paradise Hotel in Mombasa, killing the bombers as well as 12 Kenyans and three Israelis. The same morning, a missile attack unsuccessfully targeted an Israeli airliner taking off from Mombasa's airport. Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for both Mombasa attacks. U.S. forces strike in Libya, Somalia, capture al Qaeda operative . 'Most wanted terrorist' al Libi nabbed in native Libya . Witness accounts . Residents of the port city of Barawe said about a dozen ""foreign forces"" went from a nearby warship to a smaller, faster boat before jumping onto the Somali mainland. Before long, the sounds of heavy gunfire and several large explosions echoed across the city, locals said. After coming under fire, the U.S. forces -- members of the Navy special forces unit known as SEAL Team Six, the same unit that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011 -- made a ""prudent decision"" to pull back, a senior U.S. official said. Barawe ""is a main center, if not the center"" for Al-Shabaab, said Matt Bryden, the former head of the U.N. Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea. ""It's a big source of revenue for them. It allows for trade,"" said Bryden, now the director of a Kenya-based think tank, Sahan Research. They ""fully control the town"" and hold large exercises on the beach, including target practice and even sack races. Once a tourist destination, the city is now an important port for charcoal, a common fuel in Somalia, Bryden said. That makes it a revenue source for the jihadists, with the charcoal trade bringing in as much as $25 million a year to Al-Shabaab, the United Nations estimated in July. Al-Shabaab's growing menace . Al-Shabaab, designated a terrorist organization by the United States, has a relationship with al Qaeda that goes back several years. Last year, the two groups effectively merged, said CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen. Bergen: How Al-Shabaab picks its targets . Al-Shabaab hopes to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state but has launched attacks in other countries as well. In 2010, Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for two suicide bombings carried out in Kampala, Uganda, amid crowds of soccer fans watching televised screenings of the World Cup final. The bombings left 74 people dead. The group said at the time the attacks were retaliation for Ugandan participation in the African Union Mission in Somalia, known as AMISOM. One AMISOM goal is to support Somali government forces in cracking down on Al-Shabaab. Al-Shabaab has also mounted many smaller attacks against targets in Kenya, hurling hand grenades into nightclubs, restaurants and schools. The group has also kidnapped tourists and aid workers. Its attack on the Westgate mall in Kenya on September 21 killed at least 67 people. Al-Shabaab said the attack was retaliation for Kenya's involvement in the African Union effort against the group. In recent months, Al-Shabaab's haven in south-central Somalia has been been increasingly squeezed as Kenyan forces fight the group from the south and African Union forces come down from Mogadishu, the Somali capital. Journalist Omar Nor contributed to this report from Mogadishu, Somalia; CNN's Tim Lister, Nima Elbagir, Holly Yan, Emma Lacey-Bordeaux, Melissa Gray and Greg Botelho also contributed to this report.","NEW: Kenyan officials said Ikrima helped recruit Kenyans into Al-Shabaab .

"(CNN) -- I'm crossing the Damaraland desert of northern Namibia on foot -- a few hundred kilometers -- clutching my ""bear banger."" This device looks like a pen and fits in my pocket. Triggered, it will explode with a loud bang, scaring animals without harming them. I'm with my guide, Lloyd Camp, on the trail of the elusive black rhino in one of the few truly wild places left in the world. ""The worst thing we could do is to run away from an animal -- we'll be finished,"" Lloyd warns me. Tragedy of the rhino . Driven to the brink of extinction, the black rhino's story is one of the most tragic wildlife crimes. Due to poaching, 92% of the population has been wiped out over the past 30 years, and there are now just 5,055 left in the world. These numbers are an improvement, however, from the lowest point of 2,500 in the 1980s and are thanks to conservation efforts and, perhaps surprisingly, tourism. Firstly, in the early 1980s, Save the Rhino Trust (SRT) was formed to offer poachers a more secure livelihood as wildlife rangers. In 2003, SRT partnered with Wilderness Safaris, an eco-tourism operator. Their common vision was to view the rhino discreetly. By accommodating tourists willing to pay money to track rhinos on foot, they provided employment for locals and income for monitoring and research. After 30 years of work and 10 years of responsible tourism, rhino numbers increased fivefold. Desert tracking . Damaraland is now home to the largest concentration of black rhino on Earth. The green crowns of ana trees dot the brown palette of the landscape, carrying thick, curled reddish brown fruits that desert elephants love. Hours-old footprints of a bull elephant give us our first tracking opportunity. We eventually catch up to him as he's eating from the thorny branches of an ana tree. Waves of emotions rush through me as we stop and stand still. He knows we're here. The encounter has begun. ""He's not bothered by us,"" Lloyd whispers to me. ""It's a respectful sighting, the type that I really enjoy."" The next day at 6 a.m. the rangers and I leave Wilderness Safaris' Desert Rhino Camp. After an hour's drive we see fresh rhino tracks on a riverbed and follow on foot. Tracking soon becomes difficult, as there are no footsteps anymore, just rocks that have been moved. Finding them is an exercise in mindfulness. Tracking epitomizes abilities that humans have almost completely lost: to read the landscape and be aware of its smallest details. As they walk, the rangers wave their hands as if in an ancient dance: open hands, palm forward, indicating each track or to inform others of a new direction. Nobody talks, just a gentle whistle to attract attention. Then we find fresh dung. One of the rangers, Martin Nawaseb, squats to check its temperature. It's still hot. Feeling close, we increase our pace and come to view a riverbed. The rhino is there, grazing. He raises his head toward us; he knows something's up. Keeping ourselves at a distance, we sit in silence and enjoy the tranquil landscape. Martin writes down the GPS position in his logbook. Tracking is an effective way to understand animal behavior. The importance of pride . Rangers in Damaraland are proud of their job and the community looks up at people like Martin. ""Poaching is essentially not an issue anymore in Namibia because conservation efforts put local communities at the center,"" says Jeff Muntifering, a scientific advisor at SRT. ""It's become socially unacceptable; poachers are viewed as stealing from the community."" He says in Mozambique it's the opposite: poachers crossing the border to kill animals in South Africa are considered Robin Hoods, risking their lives to bring back to the community the little money paid by international syndicates trading in illegal ivory. How to keep it going . While examples like STR in Namibia and tourism ventures such as the Rhino Desert Camp are the success stories of conservation, their effectiveness is being threatened again by a recent surge in poaching. Fueled by a growing demand for rhino horn in Asia, 1,004 rhino were killed in 2013, up from 668 killed in 2012 and just 13 killed in 2007. In response to these alarming figures, 46 countries agreed in London earlier this year on a declaration to tackle wildlife crimes. The hope is that this is the turning point for the fight against poaching.","Poaching has wiped out 92% of black rhino population in the last 30 years .

"(CNN) -- A Danish entrepreneur is trying to end poverty in Africa through microcredit -- funding African businesses by connecting them with investors from around the world. Tim Vang is the co-founder of MYC4, a web-based marketplace that lets investors bid to provide loans to small and medium-sized African businesses. Bidders compete in an online auction, with those offering money at the lowest interest rates financing the loan. Typically, around 50 investors will part fund a single loan. All the businesses applying for a loan have been vetted and judged to have good growth prospects. MYC4 says the model gives African entrepreneurs access to credit at low interest rates, while allowing lenders to make a profit from the interest. It's a system MYC4 claims can help eradicate poverty in Africa by building its economies from the bottom up. Over 18,000 investors from 107 countries have so far invested more than €12 million in 6,346 African businesses, according to MYC4. Vang discussed his business-oriented approach to fighting poverty with CNN's Max Foster. CNN: In terms of where you got the idea from, what were the needs you discovered? Tim Vang: Six years ago, I met the other co-founder Mads (Kjær) in a cab in London by coincidence and he had been working the last two decades within and for Africa, whereas I hadn't. We actually got inspired by how we can help Africa -- we read everywhere that Africa is growing, the GDP growing 5% a year, but actually the access directly to these small and medium-sized enterprises is hard, so we said ""could we create an infrastructure that was investing directly in African entrepreneurs?"" We will have a completely different story -- it's not about waiting for the U.N. and others to save the world, it is about you and I having a tool at our fingertips to be able to help and save the world, make it a better world. CNN: So we get the story of someone that is looking for some finance and then you can offer a loan. Explain how that works through the site. TV: Round numbers -- an entrepreneur is looking for €1,000, we're 10 people each with €100 and we go in and bid. There's a Dutch auction -- so you come with a very attractive offer of 3%, I'm trying to optimize my bid and come with a 28% and altogether the average weighted interest is that it fulfills the borrower's need -- and then person number 11 comes in and says, ""Tim, you are too expensive,"" and kicks me out with a lower interest rate and I can come back into the auction. CNN: So someone with some money can offer a loan and the one with the cheapest rate at the end gets to give the loan. TV: Yes, not just one, there could be several. We've seen loans with one lender, we've also seen several hundred lenders within each loan. CNN: And how do we know a borrower isn't using some of the money that your businesses lent him on a project which isn't the project that you think you are investing in? TV: We have providers which are our partners in Africa, financial institutions, that are doing the vetting of the business, looking at their business plan  -- can they repay? Do they have the ability? Also we run spot checks, ensuring that the loan they are asking for is also used for the business growth. CNN: How do I know that is safe? Because you are not a bank, so you are not regulated like a bank. Where does the regulation come from? TV: We work together with banks, we are, popularly said, a platform on top of banks, meaning your money will never be in our platform, it will be in a bank and that bank will transfer it to another bank in the local country that is being disbursed. CNN: What are you appealing to in terms of the loan givers? You are offering them a chance to get involved in charity, or is it just pure business in an economy which will inevitably grow? TV: I think it is a combination; these two things go hand in hand. A smart two liner would be business must be for profit, but profit must be for a purpose. For some it is an obvious ""I want to make a profit,"" for others it is clearly the social upside of helping other people.","Tim Vang co-founded MYC4, a platform helping African entrepreneurs find money .

"(CNN) -- There are dozens of ships, aircraft and helicopters searching for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in an area nearly as big as the continental United States. Now, 4-day-old satellite images have provided a much-needed lead: two objects spotted bobbing in the southern Indian Ocean, about 14 miles apart. The race is on to find those objects -- which experts caution could just as well be lost shipping containers as a chunk of fuselage or wing -- and by analyzing currents and other data perhaps locate the site where the plane might have gone down. Let's say they find it. Would the mystery be solved? Hardly. Finding the aircraft is just the beginning. Assuming that the plane crashed and that it's on the bottom of the ocean, search crews would face myriad obstacles in recovering parts of the plane and in piecing together what happened. And the treacherous waters of the southern Indian Ocean would only add to the challenge, said John Blaxland, a senior fellow at the Australian National University and expert on Australia's radar systems. ""The problem is that that piece of flotsam and jetsam is not where it was when the photograph was taken four days ago. The currents have taken it a long way eastwards,"" he said. ""So the aircraft are looking, in poor visibility, and this is the area that we used to call the 'Roaring Forties'; this is in the 19th century the kind of waters that ships got wrecked in. So this is really treacherous stretches of water, not easy to work in, very hard to detect things in."" The cases of TWA Flight 800 and Air France Flight 447 hint at the difficulties that might lie ahead. The first demonstrates how tedious reconstruction work is and how important that work is to explaining exactly what went wrong, while the second shows just how long an ocean recovery can take. ""First thing to do is get back those recorders because ... there's a huge amount of data in the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder. Get those back, and then we can see what we need to do next. But, you know, time is of the essence,"" said Tom Haueter, former director of the National Transportation Safety Board's Office of Aviation Safety. He knows what he's talking about. How do passenger jets change flight paths? Debunking conspiracy theories . Haueter investigated the July 1996 crash of TWA Flight 800, which exploded in midair shortly after takeoff from New York, killing all 230 people on board. His job began at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. U.S. Navy and other divers spent more than 1,600 hours scouring for clues. ""We found pieces from just forward of the center section of the wing. Then we found the nose of the aircraft. And then we found the wings and the tail, the engines and everything else further down the flight path,"" Haueter said. The NTSB ruled that the explosion was caused by an electrical short circuit, which detonated the fuel tank and caused the Boeing 747 to break into pieces in the waters off Long Island. The evidence was pieced together from a debris field of 75 square miles. Thousands of fragments were pulled from a tangled web of wires and airplane skin. ""We map the bottom. You start recovering things. You get back seat cushions, victim remains, and what you do is X-ray everything, because you're looking for an explosion. You're looking for fast particles that may have been captured by a seat cushion or a body."" Haueter said. As awful as it is to think about, recovered bodies can provide critical clues about a flight's final moments. Haueter said, ""Take a look at all the information. Is there burning on the bodies beforehand? We'll get autopsies. Is there soot in the trachea showing that there's fire on board?"" In the case of TWA Flight 800, extracting the wreckage from the water and reconstructing it was critical to debunking various conspiracy theories. Witnesses said they saw a streak of light and a fireball, leading to suspicions that terrorists struck the plane with a rocket. Others blamed a meteor or a missile. Piecing the aircraft together was necessary to get a fuller picture. ""We take a look at everything we have here, and what we couldn't find anywhere in TWA was any evidence of being hit from a missile from the outside,"" Haueter said. Why were there no phone calls? Findings released three years after flight . Like that flight, the experience of Air France Flight 447 provides clues about what could happen if Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is found at the bottom of the ocean. On June 1, 2009, Air France Flight 447 was en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris when communications from the Airbus A330 ended suddenly. Its last known position -- two to four days by ship from the nearest ports -- and the ocean's depth hindered search efforts. It took four searches over the course of nearly two years to locate the bulk of the wreckage and the majority of the 228 bodies in a mountain range deep under the surface. It took even longer to find the cause of the disaster. ""We had three autonomous underwater vehicles -- basically unmanned submarines that swim programmed tracks over the sea floor. They'd go back and forth using acoustic sensors to map the sea floor, and from those maps, we could detect the wreckage site,"" said Mike Purcell with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. In May 2011, the aircraft's voice recorder and flight data recorder were recovered from the ocean floor after an extensive search. It was not until July 2012 that investigators published their report, which blamed the crash on a series of errors by the pilots and a failure to react effectively to technical problems. Malaysia has warned that it does not have the kind of submarine technology used to find the voice and flight data recorders for Air France Flight 447. So there's no time to be lost in tracking them down before the batteries powering their locating device run dry. David Gallo, also with Woods Hole, helped lead the search for the recorders of Air France Flight 447. He described what would happen once some debris from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is found, though he stressed there's still no evidence the plane hit the water. Because of currents, the wind and new information, the search area is getting bigger by the day. ""Once a piece of the debris is found -- if it did impact on the water -- then you've got to backtrack that debris to try to find the 'X marks the spot' on where the plane actually hit the water, because that would be the center of the haystack,"" Gallo said. ""And in that haystack, you're trying to find bits of that needle -- in fact, in the case of the flight data recorders, you're looking for a tiny little bit of that needle,"" he said. 'We are flying partially blind' Blaxland is similarly blunt about the challenges even in finding the two objects picked up the satellite in the southern Indian Ocean, let alone finding a potential crash site and recovering the plane. Even with the help of the ""best surveillance technology on the planet"" on the P-3 and P-8 maritime surveillance aircraft, ""it's still really hard in this kind of environment to pick up these little, semi-submerged blips,"" he said. ""You're looking for something that potentially isn't even there any more."" Although the technology will pick up subsurface objects, he said, ""the problem is, you've got limited resources; you've got limited flying hours. ""This is a long way away from the Australian shore. This is at the upper reaches of the flight capacity of these aircraft. They can only stay out there for a couple of hours, and this is a massive stretch of water we are talking about trying to cover. ""So, unfortunately, are flying partially blind here. We've got out-of-date information. The currents have moved the flotsam and jetsam to another location which we cannot locate. ""There's no emanations we are picking up to identify where that would be, and this means it's really a needle in the haystack."" Pinger locators . The southern Indian Ocean is often described as one of the most remote locations on Earth. Recovery specialists -- as well as the U.S. Navy -- often use locators to find the ping emanating from a flight recorder of a commercial aircraft. ""If the debris is verified, then there are pinger locators that are simple (boat-)towed hydrophones that can look for the signals of those pingers while they're still within that 30-day life expectancy of the battery,"" said Mike Williamson, who runs a Seattle engineering firm specializing in deep-sea searches of planes and shipwrecks. ""If that's possible, that can really give a much better idea of where the wreckage is,"" he added. The middle of an ocean is a daunting environment, however. ""But in those conditions and the remoteness of the area, I'd be rather surprised if they can get a pinger locator out there and get any thing -- because at this water depth, the range is very limited on listening to those pingers,"" Williamson said.

When they're gone, their loved ones must carry on. Taryn Davis' husband, Army Cpl. Michael Davis, was 22 when he died in Iraq five years ago. She was 21. She was young, she was told; she'll meet someone else, marry someone else. She was given the names of support groups, but they were filled with people much older. She felt adrift. It wasn't until she met the widow of one of her husband's comrades that she found her way forward. ""For me, it was inspiring,"" Davis, a 2011 Top 10 CNN Hero, said. ""Like, 'Man, if she can get up every day and do this with a child, I can do this. ... I can't let her down.'

Jay Choe is part of an uncommon group: widowers of war, a creation of the changing landscape of the U.S. military, as CNN's Wayne Drash observed. Choe is also the father of a young girl. ""I was thrust into a role I wasn't familiar with,"" Choe said. The years since have been difficult. Most challenging has been raising his daughter as a single father.

But Marlantes was haunted by his experiences in Vietnam. He had nightmares. He felt guilt. He could get angry. Finally, he sought help. He was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Counseling made a difference; so did faith. He's written two books about his experiences, a novel and a memoir, books that are both inspirational and cautionary. Now he wants others to remember, too. ""When the peace treaty is signed, the war isn't over for the veterans or the family,"" he says. ""It's just starting."" Braydon Nichols, on the other hand, always wants to remember. Nichols was the 10-year-old boy from Missouri who lost his father, Bryan, in Afghanistan and sent an iReport to CNN as a way to commemorate him. The story inspired more than 230 iReports and received thousands of responses. Not only is there a college fund for Braydon; the Special Operations Warrior Foundation set up accounts to handle college tuition and room and board expenses for the children of every Army family who died in the Chinook helicopter crash that killed Braydon's father, an Army officer. Braydon, for the most part, is doing well. But his uncle, Monte Nichols, says the boy's father remains in the family's heart. ""Bryan is with us all the time, every day his memory is alive for us."" Memory is important. Rose Mary Sabo Brown spent just one month with her husband, Army Spec. Leslie Sabo Jr., before he left for Vietnam in 1969. Six months after that, he was dead. It took more than 42 years, but Leslie Sabo Jr. was finally awarded the Medal of Honor earlier this month for his bravery in battle. He'd been recommended for it by his unit, but somehow the recommendation was overlooked. President Obama presented the medal to Sabo Brown on May 16. ""I've never stopped thinking about him,"" she said of her late husband. ""My heart is filled with pride that you can't even imagine."" Pride. Pain. It's a terrible double-edged sword, memory is. At its best, it fills us with tenderness; at its worst, it racks us with grief. And when it comes to the fallen, it's hard to face the blade. But some people, we should recall, don't have a choice.

"(CNN) -- A pea-sized seahorse, the world's longest insect, a ""ghost slug"" and the world's smallest snake were among the top 10 species discovered in 2008, a committee of scientists said Friday. A tiny seahorse and the world's longest insect were among the top 10 new species discovered in 2008. These unusual critters were among thousands of species found last year, many in remote or tropical regions of the planet, that hint at the breadth of the Earth's undiscovered biodiversity. ""Most people do not realize just how incomplete our knowledge of Earth's species is,"" said Quentin Wheeler, director of the International Institute for Species Exploration at Arizona State University, which announced the top 10 new species list. ""We are surrounded by such an exuberance of species diversity that we too often take it for granted,"" Wheeler added. The ASU institute and an international committee of taxonomists -- scientists devoted to species exploration and classification -- compile the top 10 list of new species each year. Also on the 2008 list are a caffeine-free coffee plant, a snail whose shell twists around four axes, a palm that flowers itself to death and microscopic bacteria that live in hairspray.   See photos of the new species » . Here's the complete list: . 1. Pygmy seahorse: Classified by its Latin name, Hippocampus satomiae, this species measures about half an inch long and was found near Derawan Island off Kalimantan, Indonesia. 2. A plant that kills itself: Found in a small area of northwestern Madagascar, a rare genus of palm -- Tahina spectablilis -- produces huge, spectacular flowers and then dies and collapses. Fewer than 100 have been found. 3. Decaf, please: Known as Coffea charrieriana, this plant found in Cameroon is the first record of a caffeine-free coffee species from Central Africa. 4. Spray-on species: An extremophile bacteria, Microbacterium hatanonis, was discovered in hairspray by Japanese scientists. 5. A stick that moves: The world's longest insect, with a body length of 14 inches (22.3 inches including legs), Phobaeticus chani resembles a stick and was found in Borneo, Malaysia. 6. The Barbados Threadsnake: Leptotyphlops carlae measures only 4.1 inches long and is believed to be the world's smallest snake. 7. A pale ""ghost slug"": Selenochlamys ysbryda was a surprising find in the densely populated area of Cardiff, Wales. 8. A very limber snail: This unique species, Opisthostoma vermiculum, is found on a limestone hill in Malaysia and has a shell that twists around four axes. 9. Damsel in the deep blue sea: Chromis abyssus is a beautiful species of damselfish found in deep-reef habitat off the coast of Ngemelis Island, Palau. 10. Fossil mama: A fossilized fish, Materpiscis attenboroughi, is an extremely rare find from Western Australia and shows a mother giving birth 380 million years ago. Scientists are still classifying species found around the globe in 2008, so final data for that year are not available. But on Friday, the taxonomists issued a State of Observed Species report card that states 18,516 species new to science -- about half of them insects -- were discovered and described in 2007. The vast majority of the 18,516 species named in 2007 were invertebrate animals (75.6 percent), vascular plants (11.1 percent) and vertebrates (6.7 percent). The report was compiled by ASU's International Institute for Species Exploration in partnership with other scientists. ""Charting the species of the world and their unique attributes are essential parts of understanding the history of life,"" Wheeler said. ""It is in our own self-interest as we face the challenges of living on a rapidly changing planet."" According to Wheeler, a new generation of tools is coming online that will vastly accelerate the rate at which humans can discover and describe species. The annual release of the top 10 new species list and State of Observed Species report commemorate the anniversary of the birth of Carolus Linnaeus, who initiated the modern system of plant and animal names and classifications. An estimated 1.8 million species have been described since Linnaeus initiated the modern systems for naming plants and animals in the 18th century. Scientists estimate that there are between 2 million and 100 million species on Earth, though most set the number closer to 10 million, according to ASU. ""It is estimated that the approximately 1.8 million species named since 1758 represent no more than a fraction of the world's species,"" the report states. ""Rapid environmental changes around the world highlight the urgent need to accelerate our exploration of Earth's species,"" the report says. ""Millions of species -- the majority not yet known to science -- face an uncertain future. Among these species are keys to understanding the history of the origin and diversification of life on our planet.""","A committee of scientists named the top 10 species discovered in 2008 .

"FORT HOOD, Texas (CNN) -- The bumper sticker reading ""Allah is Love"" was torn off and the car was keyed. A police report was filed in the August 16 incident involving Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan's Honda, and a neighbor was charged with criminal mischief. But what kind of impact that incident, and possibly others, had on Hasan remains a mystery. While few official details have been released about Hasan, his family and others have given some insight into the man accused of killing 13 people and wounded 38 others in Thursday's massacre at Fort Hood Army Post in Texas. Relatives say Hasan, a U.S.-born citizen of Palestinian descent, was a ""calm"" individual who had been taunted after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Others describe him as a vocal opponent to the war on terror whose rhetoric concerned colleagues. The bumper sticker incident at Hasan's apartment complex in Killeen, Texas, is the first known example of harassment that has surfaced since the shooting. Apartment manager John Thompson said Friday that he reported the situation to police after the girlfriend of then-resident John van de Walker told him that he did it. Thompson said he saw van de Walker apologize to Hasan and that a police report was filed. He added that the bumper sticker said ""Allah is Love"" in Arabic, but that van de Walker knew that Hasan was Muslim before seeing it. Thompson said the last time he asked Hasan about the incident, Hasan said he was still waiting for reparations for damage to his 2006 Honda Civic. Efforts to reach van de Walker on Friday were unsuccessful. Hasan's cousin, Mohammad Munif Abdallah Hasan, said the Army major had wanted to leave the military because he felt disrespected over his religion. ""There was racism towards him because he's a Muslim, because he's an Arab, because he prays,"" the cousin said in a CNN interview in the Palestinian city of Ramallah. ""They used to see him dress in traditional Muslim clothing, so he was a bit irritated because of this. Also, the fact that they wanted to send him to Iraq. He decided to leave the Army for good and hire a lawyer because of this matter."" ""They wouldn't treat him as if he is one of them. He was a major in the Army and other majors wouldn't treat him equally as a major should be treated,"" the cousin said. "" 'Yes, you are a major in the U.S. Army, but you are still an Arab, a Muslim, you have your own traditions and values and we have ours.' He was bothered by that a lot. He wasn't respected as he should have been."" The cousin added that he wanted to leave the Army, especially after getting deployment orders. Army officials have indicated that Hasan was to deploy to Afghanistan to work with a unit already there as part of behavioral health support. It wasn't clear when Hasan was scheduled to go overseas for what would have been his first deployment. Dr. Val Finnell, a former medical school classmate of Hasan's, described him as ""a very outspoken opponent of the war"" in the classroom and in public settings. ""He equated the war against terror with a war against Islam,"" Finnell said. He added that he was shocked by Thursday's shooting. ""However, that said, given the things that Maj. Hasan has said to me in the past and to other people, I am not surprised."" There are about 3,500 Muslims in the U.S. Army, less than 1 percent of the total number of soldiers. The investigation into the shootings is ongoing, and Army officials have not indicated any evidence of Hasan being harassed among the ranks. Hasan's cousin said that despite the concerns over discrimination, a motive behind the shootings still was incomprehensible. ""If he had killed one or two, I could say that he was defending himself. I could say that there could have been a problem between two sides which led to the use of weapons. But for one to kill 13 people and injure more than 30, I personally don't think that it was because someone was bothering him. There is a bigger reason that this happened and no ones knows it besides Nidal."" Mohammad Hasan remembered his cousin's trip to Jerusalem, 6 miles from Ramallah, 15 years ago to learn about his roots. ""He acted normal."" More recently, Nidal Hasan may have attended a lecture in January at George Washington University involving the Israeli ambassador to the United States and other officials discussing Israel's offensive into Gaza last winter. Video from the lecture shows a person who appears to be Hasan dressed in military fatigues seated in the audience taking notes. In a statement Friday, Hasan's family in the United States said, ""We are mortified with what has unfolded and there is no justification, whatsoever, for what happened. We are all asking why this happened -- and the answer is that we simply do not know. ""We cannot explain, nor do we excuse what happened yesterday. Yesterday's violence in no way reflects the feelings, beliefs, or principles of our family,"" the statement continued, adding that the family is cooperating with authorities. Hasan's neighbors on Friday said he cleaned out his apartment the morning of the shootings and gave copies of the Quran to several residents. His next-door neighbor, Patricia Villa, said he gave her his furniture and paid her $60 to clean his apartment hours before the shooting. ""He told me he was leaving for Iraq or somewhere,"" Villa said. ""I didn't think much of it."" Another neighbor, Willie Bell, said Hasan had helped him set up his laptop and regularly tapped into Bell's wireless service. Bell, a maintenance man at Fort Hood who didn't show up for work Thursday, said he was interviewed by the FBI for four hours that day and the laptop was seized. He said he received two calls from Hasan early Thursday, one at 2:37 a.m. asking Bell to turn on the wireless service and again at 5 a.m. to say he was moving. An owner of a 7-Eleven convenience store at Fort Hood said Hasan, whom he knew as ""Maj. Nidal,"" came in for coffee and hash browns most mornings, including the morning of the shootings. Surveillance video from the store obtained by CNN shows a man who the store owner said is Hasan at the cashier's counter about 6:20 a.m. Thursday -- about seven hours before the shooting -- carrying a beverage and dressed in traditional Arab garb. While the owner said he was too busy to chat with Hasan on Thursday, he said that through his brief talks with Hasan he learned the officer didn't speak Arabic well. He added that Hasan didn't wear a wedding ring and joked several times about whether the owner knew a bride for him. Hasan would also ask the owner whether he planned to attend Friday prayers, a mainstay of Islam, to which the owner would say that he was too busy. Hasan was known to attend Friday prayers in Bethesda, Maryland, before he arrived at Fort Hood this year, said Imam Yahya Hendi, the Muslim chaplain at the National Naval Medical Center. ""I met him a few times and I saw him at services ... he appeared to be a very loyal American,"" Hendi told CNN's ""Situation Room."" ""I know he told me once that he joined the military because he wanted to do something for America in the aftermath of September 11. ""He also told me once that he believed that Muslims who speak a language of exclusivity should not have room in the Muslim community -- that we must reject them,"" the chaplain continued. ""And that's why for me, when I saw the footage yesterday about him, I said, 'Wait a minute -- is this the same guy I met a few years ago?' ""","Maj.

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- A South African pensioner has died while waiting in a queue to buy tickets for the soccer World Cup, with people lining up for 20 hours in some cases and system problems causing further delays. Cape Town police spokesperson Ezra October confirmed to CNN that 64-year-old Ralph van Heerden collapsed and died while waiting to purchase 11 World Cup tickets on Thursday morning. He was certified dead by paramedics when they arrived on the scene at around 7:15 a.m. local time (0515 GMT). It is believed that he had a heart problem. According to police, paramedics tried to resuscitate him but failed. The man had waiting in line for five hours and was number 565 in the queue. ireport: Send us your pictures and videos of buying your ticket . South Africans across the country have been queuing since Wednesday afternoon in a last-minute bid to be part of the first football World Cup on the continent, with 500,000 tickets still available. Are you going to the World Cup? Click here to become a CNN Super Fan. CNN's Nkepile Mabuse was in a queue outside the Sandown ticketing center in Johannesburg, one of 11 across the country. She said the first person in line there had been waiting for 20 hours -- and then he had to wait an extra hour due to problems with the ticket machines. ""I talked to a member of the local organizing committee and he said the system had crashed. The tickets couldn't be printed,"" Mabuse said. The tickets will be available only to South Africans until 1600 GMT, and from then overseas people will also be able to purchase them through the Web site of soccer's governing body FIFA. FIFA said 1,610 tickets were sold to 310 customers nationally at the ticketing center within the first hour on Thursday morning, with 2,166 tickets bought by 470 fans at branches of the First National Bank. ""There was a massive demand for tickets this morning, which we are delighted with. We experienced some delays in issuing tickets at the outset, but we have been working on improving the response time of the system,"" said James Byrom of FIFA's official ticketing service provider MATCH. Mabuse said it is likely there will be empty seats at some of the tournament's group-stage games, especially outside the main cities, despite South Africans being offered tickets at a discounted rate of $18. ""It is going to be very difficult to sell them all -- only 220,000 were sold at the last phase,"" she said. Many of the 500,000 tickets made available had been returned from overseas affiliates. ""There are fewer foreign fans coming than originally expected. There were 450,000 expected but it will be nowhere that, people have been saying it'll be more like 300-350,000."" Another problem for local organizers is that South Africans are used to buying tickets on the day of events. Tickets had previously been only available via the Internet and one South African bank, but organizers have been forced to allow supermarkets to become outlets as well as the 11 official sales centers. ""It has been very difficult for South Africans to get tickets,"" Mabuse said. ""The majority of people here are poor and they can't afford to buy tickets. And only 10 percent of the population have access to the Internet."" FIFA gave away many tickets at the Confederations Cup in South Africa last year to avoid the prospect of empty stadiums, but Mabuse said that was unlikely to be repeated at the World Cup. ""I asked FIFA general secretary Jerome Valcke and he said that was not going to happen again -- they would rather have some empty seats than give tickets away,"" she said.","A 64-year-old man dies while waiting to buy tickets for the soccer World Cup in South Africa .

"(CNN) -- Federal authorities were at the apartment of deceased bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev on Sunday, executing a search warrant, an FBI spokeswoman said. Amanda Cox said, ""There is court-authorized law enforcement activity"" at the home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that Tsarnaev shared with his wife and young daughter. Workers in white hazmat suits were at the apartment, CNN affiliate WCVB reported. Cox said the search stopped for the day in the early afternoon. It was not immediately clear whether workers had taken anything from the home. On Friday, a source briefed on the investigation said investigators found explosives residue in the small apartment. It has turned up in at least three places, the source said: the kitchen table, the kitchen sink and the bathtub. Tsarnaev's younger brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, has said they built the bombs there, U.S. law enforcement officials briefed on the progress of the investigation said. On Sunday, Tamerlan Tsarnaev's body remained at a funeral home, where his uncle said he was trying to deal with the logistics of readying the body for burial. ""I'm here to prepare his body, to wash it, shroud it, to prepare his body,"" Ruslan Tsarni said. Tsarni said he was the only family member at the funeral home and had not had contact with Katherine Russell, Tamerlan's widow. The funeral home owner, Peter Stefan, said he still has yet to find a cemetery willing to accept the body for burial. A day earlier, he had said that if no gravesite is found, he plans to ask the government to find a grave. Three cemeteries that Stefan contacted said they feared reprisals, but the funeral home owner said you can't pick and choose when it comes to a burial. ""This is what we do in a civilized society, regardless of the circumstances,"" Stefan said. ""As I told some of them, at the immediate moment, you may fear (reprisal), but later on, when things calm down, people are going to resent you because you didn't do it."" Tsarnaev's death certificate has yet to be filed with the Boston city clerk, and there is no burial plot, according to the funeral home. The city manager of Cambridge said Sunday he would not allow Tsarnaev to be buried in the city if requested by the funeral director or Tsarnaev's family. ""The difficult and stressful efforts of the citizens of the City of Cambridge to return to a peaceful life would be adversely impacted by the turmoil, protests, and widespread media presence at such an interment,"" City Manager Robert W. Healy said in a statement. Tsarnaev died April 19 after he and his brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, shot a university police officer to death, carjacked an SUV and hurled bombs at officers pursuing them, according to authorities. A few days earlier -- April 15 -- he and his younger brother allegedly bombed the Boston Marathon, killing three and wounding more than 260. CNN obtained a copy of Tamerlan Tsarnaev's death certificate, which lists the cause of death as ""gunshot wounds of torso and extremities"" and ""blunt trauma to head and torso."" The document notes that Tsarnaev was shot by police and run over and dragged by a car. It lists the manner of death as homicide and notes that he was ""DOA,"" or dead on arrival. Authorities have said his younger brother may have run him over as they resisted arrest days after the marathon attacks. Separately, 12 people remained hospitalized with bombing-related injuries on Saturday, according to a count by CNN. None was in serious condition. Also, the frantic manhunt more than two weeks ago for the surviving bombing suspect drew the attention of gun rights advocates at their convention in Houston. National Rifle Association Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre said residents were ""imprisoned"" in their homes with no means to protect themselves while police searched for the younger Tsarnaev. ""How many Bostonians wished they had a gun two weeks ago?"" he asked. ""Boston proves it. When brave law enforcement officers did their job in that city so courageously, good guys with guns stopped terrorists with guns,"" he said. 'Everyone deserves to be buried' Tamerlan Tsarnaev's body remained unclaimed until Thursday, when Tsarni, who had previously publicly condemned his alleged attacks, had a funeral parlor pick up the body. Tsarni had decried the bomb suspects as ""losers"" after the attacks. Their parents in Dagestan have said they will not fly his body back to Russia for burial, spokeswoman Heda Saratova said. WCVB reported that the hearse that picked up Tsarnaev's body ferried it to a funeral home 30 miles from Boston, near the Rhode Island state line. Residents of North Attleboro, Massachusetts, took to the streets to boo Tsarnaev when they heard about the presence of the corpse in their town, The Sun Chronicle reported. Others took to social media to vent anger at the funeral home for accepting the body. It was later transported to Stefan's funeral home, Graham Putnam & Mahoney Funeral Parlors in Worcester. ""Everyone deserves to be buried,"" Stefan said. The marathon bombings . Authorities say the brothers carried out the Boston Marathon bombings using explosive devices made with pressure cookers. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, is being held at a federal Bureau of Prisons medical facility in Devens, Massachusetts, charged with using a weapon of mass destruction, which carries the death penalty. He is being treated for gunshot wounds to the head, neck, legs and hands that he received in the shootout with police that led to his brother's death. Other target, possible cover-up . The marathon was not the original target, the law enforcement officials said. The brothers had set their sights on a suicide attack on the city's massive Independence Day celebration, which draws about 500,000 people and is televised nationally. But the bombs were ready sooner than anticipated, and a day or two before the Boston Marathon, they changed their plans, the officials said. They spoke on the condition that their names not be used because they were not authorized to discuss the matter with the media. One key question involves whether intelligence, law enforcement and homeland security agencies could have done more in their investigation of Tamerlan Tsarnaev in recent years before the attack and whether they shared information effectively enough. An independent government review is under way. In an interview with Univision published on its website on Saturday, President Barack Obama said that cooperation among agencies can always get better. But he again defended U.S. efforts. ""I think we can continue to improve and refine how we're engaging and countering terrorist activity,"" Obama said. ""I don't think it's fair to say though that law enforcement dropped the ball."" It is very difficult to prevent attacks when dealing with individuals who are self-radicalized and not part of a massive conspiracy or network, he said about the current belief of investigators looking at the origins of the Boston bombing. Tamerlan's widow; Dzhokhar's friends . Tamerlan Tsarnaev's widow, Russell, has remained largely out of view since her husband's death, staying in her parents' Rhode Island home. Her attorney, Amato DeLuca, says the 24-year-old knew nothing about plans to bomb the race, and reports of her husband's involvement came as an ""absolute shock"" to Russell and her family. Three of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's friends have been accused of covering for the bombing suspects. Azamat Tazhayakov and Dias Kadyrbayev, both from Kazakhstan, were charged Wednesday with conspiring to discard potentially incriminating items from Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's dorm room. Robel Phillipos, a U.S. citizen, was charged with making false statements to investigators. All three are accused of removing items from Tsarnaev's dorm room after the bombings. According to FBI affidavits released this week, they left with the backpack and Vaseline -- which Tazhayakov believed could be used to make bombs -- and Tsarnaev's laptop. Investigators found the backpack, fireworks and Vaseline in a landfill last week after a two-day search. The laptop was turned over by Kadyrbayev on April 19, the same day the FBI raided the apartment he shared with Tazhayakov, Kadyrbayev's attorney Robert Stahl said. The FBI is examining the laptop, two federal law enforcement officials told CNN. Authorities have said they believe the Tsarnaev brothers acted alone but are investigating whether they could have learned from or been aided by terror groups, including groups overseas. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Susan Candiotti, Eric Feigel, Carol Cratty, Marina Carver and Deborah Feyerick contributed to this report.","NEW: Cambridge official says he won't allow burial in his city .

"(CNN) -- Roy McConnell and his three sons left their wives and children to go see the film ""Predators"" in St. Petersburg, Florida, Saturday night. They were enjoying a family reunion with a week at the beach. Around 4:30 a.m. Sunday morning, Anais McConnell woke up and noticed her husband, Nathan, wasn't lying beside her. She got out of bed and woke up the other women in the house. They waited on the sofa for the men to return, hoping they hadn't been carjacked. They saw a television report about an accident involving a black car, similar to the one the men drove to the movies, that left four people dead, but they didn't want to consider the possibility that it could be their loved ones. Anais McConnell said police weren't returning their phone calls. Hours later, authorities showed up on their porch to bring them the news: Their husbands were dead. Anais McConnell, as well as her sister-in-law and mother-in-law, were widows. Nathan, 24; his father, 51, and his two brothers, Elroy III, 28, and Kelly, 19, were killed by a drunk driver who ran a red light, police said. Their widows spoke about their losses during a  news conference Tuesday in Orlando, Florida, holding framed photographs of the men. They said they hope that sharing their story will make people think twice before getting behind the wheel after drinking. ""He wanted to teach our son how to play football and how to treat a girl right,"" said Elroy McConnell's wife, Sandie. ""I know that people will drink and drive, but know that this could have been any of you. I hope and pray that the next time you drink and drive you think about this."" Demetrius Jordan, the driver of the other car, has been charged with four counts of manslaughter while driving under the influence and one count of serious injury while driving under the influence, according to a report from the St. Petersburg Police Department. Jordan, 20, and his passenger, Mario Robinson, also 20, were taken to Bayfront Hospital with serious injuries soon after the midnight accident. The McConnell men were pronounced dead at the scene, according to the report. Kelly McConnell had celebrated his 19th birthday with his family and girlfriend the day before, a family member said. As the women described the men's accomplishments and characters, there were some chuckles and many tears. One of the women, debilitated by grief, was carried off in the middle of the news conference. The reality was still hard to accept, but they didn't want to dwell on why this happened to them, a few said. ""I hope we could work toward forgiveness,"" said Amy Voelker, Roy McConnell's widow, who also lost her three sons. ""We want to honor our guys... it would be tragic to let that young man's decision affect us in a negative way."" Voelker said the family members who stood beside her during the news conference represented only a fraction of the people affected by the men's deaths, and she hoped others could learn from the horror that had befallen her family. ""I'd hate for anyone else to have to bear this type of tragedy,"" she said. As the news conference ended, family members placed the men's photographs around a tree, where others could see and remember.","Roy McConnell, three sons were killed in a crash in St. Petersburg Saturday night .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- U.S. Army Staff Sgt. David Julian believed in America's mission in Iraq. Soldiers David Julian, left, and Ernesto Cimarrusti were killed along with three other comrades on March 10. ""It's not all fame and glory. There are a lot of hard times out here. But without Americans willing to pay the price, who's going to?"" Julian told CNN in September when we first met him and the men of Delta company. The 31-year-old father of a young girl believed that the long, exhausting hours in Iraq and the ""miserable as hell"" living conditions at his base were all worth it -- especially for Iraq's children. ""You go downtown and you got 15 kids that run up to your Humvee ... telling you how much they like you, running right up to you like you are a king,"" he said. ""Makes it worth it to know you can help with a future for the kids."" On March 10, Julian and four other soldiers and their interpreter were killed when a suicide bomber walked into the middle of their patrol and detonated himself. The soldiers killed with Julian were Staff Sgt. Shawn Suzch, 32; Staff Sgt. Ernesto Cimarrusti, 25; Cpl. Scott McIntosh, 26; and Cpl. Robert McDavid, 29. More than two months later, the surviving members of Delta company remember the fallen every second of every day. And they have no choice but to control their emotions and press on with their daily duties.  Watch soldiers push on in battle while still mourning » . ""It's hard because the thought -- the possibility of losing more guys -- it's a possibility that happens every day we go out,"" Pfc. Erroll McHugh says as he carefully scans the Baghdad streets, perched in the gunner's hatch of the Humvee. ""But it's what they would want. They wouldn't want us just sitting around mourning for them. They would want us out doing our job."" On the day of the attack, McHugh was on foot, about 25 to 30 feet away from the bomber. ""There's not a day gone by that I don't see the incident over -- that I don't think about it. I'm not going to lie, it makes me mad. I feel a lot of hatred, but it's my job. I was trained for it."" Sgt. Robert Hutson also remembers that day well. ""I was mounted,"" he says. ""There were four people on the trucks at the time. [The bomber] walked right between two of my trucks -- right behind me, like 10 feet behind me. The vest was plastered to him. There was no way we could tell. And he just set himself off."" Hutson pauses. Shrapnel tore through his helmet, and he was forced to become the senior commander on the ground because his top three commanders were felled by the blast. ""Pretty rough day."" Lt. Gregory Fredlund, the platoon commander, was in America on leave. He received the news on the phone. ""When I came back to Iraq, the platoon was in pieces. All their leadership had fallen,"" Fredlund says. Around him, his soldiers now joke and give each other a hard time to keep their thoughts from drifting. Fredlund smiles. ""It's good to see them that way. They weren't that way for some time after the tragedy."" According to the latest numbers from the Department of Defense, 4,080 U.S. troops have lost their lives in Iraq.  iReporters share their memories of the fallen » . For the soldiers still fighting the war, they draw strength on the strong bonds created among their units -- a bond strengthened by the horrors they experience in the field and a pure desire to help each other get home alive. And so they persevere. ""To tell you the truth, I have got soldiers underneath me,"" Hutson says. ""If I break down, then they won't know what to do. I mean I kind of have to do it for them. And you can't show emotion over here. If you do, you just get ate up. You just can't let it get to you."" Capt. Wes Wilhite, the company commander, says he knows a lot of his soldiers have ""some form of pent-up anger in them, but at the same time they are trained"" to deal with the loss of comrades. ""I am really proud of these guys,"" he says. ""Those five, just like everybody else who has laid down their life out here, they gave up everything, they sacrificed everything for what America is all about."" Spc. Thomas Weber says he'll most remember Julian and Suzch for becoming proud fathers of little girls while they were stationed in Iraq. ""I am glad that they got to meet their daughters -- something [the girls] won't remember, but when they grow up their mothers will be able to tell them that they met their fathers. They were all good men. What happened to them shouldn't happen."" This Memorial Day there won't be a ceremony at this small base. The pain of what happened two months ago is just too raw. Fredlund says he wishes all his soldiers were returning to America alive to be with their families at the end of their tours. ""I would have loved to bring all my men home. I would love that more than anything,"" he says. ""To not be able to do that, it's going to be very bittersweet going back.""","Staff Sgt.

"(CNN) -- At the heart of a $600 million complex of Miami condominium and office towers, a network of holes in the ground has provided new insight into the people who were there first. The holes lay out the foundations of a prehistoric settlement of the ancient Tequesta tribe at the confluence of the Miami River and Biscayne Bay. The Tequesta lived in what's now metro Miami until the 1700s, and the holes held pine posts that framed their thatched buildings. ""We got to the point in recent months where we realized this wasn't an isolated circle or structure but a whole complex of buildings,"" said archaeologist Bob Carr, whose company was hired to conduct a historical analysis of the building site. The settlement is likely to have been home to hundreds of people, perhaps as many as 1,000. ""In some ways, I would say it's probably the best-preserved prehistoric town plan in eastern North America,"" Carr said. Since October, his team has unearthed several thousand holes carved into the limestone that makes up Miami's bedrock. In addition to the circular layouts, the team found linear structures Carr said may have been boardwalks for the waterfront settlement. The site also houses the foundations of the Royal Palm Hotel, one of the resorts built by legendary Florida developer Henry Flagler in the late 19th century. But the post holes and various pieces of pottery recovered at the site over the years date back to 500-600 B.C., Carr said. The discovery means a new hurdle for the Metropolitan Miami complex, which is nearing completion after more than a decade of work. The site is slated to house Met Square, a residential/retail building with a movie theater, but city officials still have to sign off on the final plans. ""This is the last element of a very extensive downtown development project, all of which has been hugely successful,"" said Gene Stearns, a lawyer for the Metropolitan Miami developers. The developers have proposed cutting out a section of the limestone, rebuilding a Tequesta structure on top of it using the original post holes and putting it on display in Met Square. The structure would be paired with a model of the native village based on the layout Carr's team has discovered, Stearns said. ""The point of it is to create knowledge -- not just to save things but to understand them,"" Stearns said. The company's plan would allow the public to learn more about the site than they would if the site were simply preserved as is, as another Tequesta site nearby -- the ""Miami Circle,"" identified in 1998 -- has been, he said. But the plans will need to be approved by Miami's Historic Preservation Board, which meets on February 14, and then the City Commission. Met Square ""is a critical element of the entire plan, and the developer needs to meet the schedule,"" Stearns said. ""It's already been delayed for the years it took to do this analysis, and it's time here to move on."" Ryan Franklin of the Archaeological and Historical Conservancy told CNN Miami affiliate WFOR he is concerned that the historic integrity of the site could be lost, even with the proposal to display a section. ""If you have a book and you tear out a chapter, you lose the integrity of the book,"" he told the station. ""You might have this part of it, but you lose part of the story."" The Tequesta lived in south Florida for roughly 2,000 years, Carr said. But they had disappeared by the time Britain took control of Florida from the Spanish in 1763, with the remnants of their population believed to have migrated to Cuba, he said. 8 very old sites in the New World . 10,000-year-old house, other ancient finds unearthed .","Miami dig lays out ""a whole complex of buildings"" in a prehistoric town .

"(CNN) -- So, just what is Russia up to now? On April 17, at the same time Russian President Vladimir Putin snarled at Ukraine and the West at a press conference in Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov signed a conciliatory agreement in Geneva with the United States, the European Union and Ukraine. On the face of it, the foreign minister seemed to repudiate the President and betray the pro-Russian terrorists in eastern Ukraine. Whatever Putin and Lavrov's game, the statement signed by Lavrov in Geneva represents a major stand down by Russia. To be sure, given the Kremlin's past mendacity and slipperiness, the agreement is ultimately nothing more than a piece of paper. If Putin could breach the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances (wherein the United States, the United Kingdom and Russia agreed to guarantee Ukraine's security and territorial integrity), he could easily tear up the Geneva statement if and when it suits him. In his press conference, true to form, Putin denied the existence of Ukrainians as a separate nation, reserved to himself the right to intervene in Ukraine, and supported the pro-Putin armed commandos who have caused havoc in eastern Ukraine. Here's Putin on Ukrainians as really being Russians: ""The desire to get Russia and Ukraine to quarrel, to divide what is essentially a single people has been an object of international politics for centuries."" It gets worse. Putin says the fanatical Bolsheviks and their reactionary White opponents agreed on one thing only: that Ukraine and Russia were a ""part of a common, united space and a single people."" And, he adds, ""They were absolutely right."" Ukrainians, naturally, beg to differ. And they worry. If Ukraine has no right to exist as a separate nation, then why shouldn't Putin bring Ukrainians ""home"" whenever he chooses to follow in the footsteps of the Bolsheviks and the Whites? Here's Putin on the right to intervene to ""help"" Russians and ""Russian-speaking citizens"" in Ukraine: ""But we know exactly that we ought to do everything to help these people defend their rights and independently determine their fate. This is what we will fight for. Let me remind you that the Federation Council of Russia gave the president the right to use armed forces in Ukraine. I very much hope that I will not have to exercise this right and that, through political and diplomatic means, we will be able to resolve all the acute, if not indeed very acute, problems in Ukraine today."" Unsurprisingly, Putin's insistence that he has a right to aid Ukrainian citizens spooks Ukrainians, especially as his invocation of that right is coupled with the continued massing of thousands of battle-ready Russian troops along Ukraine's borders. Finally, here's Putin on the pro-Russian commandos who have terrorized southeastern Ukraine in the last week and thereby compelled Kiev to try to regain control of the region: . ""Now we hear of calls (by the West) to the people in the southeast to lay down their arms. ... But then (the Ukrainian authorities should) pull back the army from the civilian population. ... All right, the east will disarm, all right, let's assume the army will withdraw -- why have the (Ukrainian) nationalist groups not been disarmed yet?"" One of the central points of the Geneva statement undermines Putin's concerns: ""All illegal armed groups must be disarmed; all illegally seized buildings must be returned to legitimate owners; all illegally occupied streets, squares and other public places in Ukrainian cities and towns must be vacated."" Geneva made it clear that all groups should be disarmed and all buildings and streets be vacated -- immediately. There is no talk in the statement of one side's disarming first and then the other's disarming next. Because virtually no Ukrainian armed groups are in Ukraine, nor are they occupying buildings -- the groups have been disarmed in the last few weeks -- the statement applies almost exclusively to the Russian-supported, Russian-funded, and Russian-directed commando-terrorists. Lavrov also signed the following statement: ""Amnesty will be granted to protesters and to those who have left buildings and other public places and surrendered weapons, with the exception of those found guilty of capital crimes."" This is, indirectly, a recognition of the Ukrainian government's legitimacy, something that Putin repeatedly denied at his press conference. After all, who is to capture the terrorists and determine if they committed capital crimes? The Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs, the procurator's office, and the Ministry of Justice, of course. If the government is illegitimate, then so, too, they are illegitimate. Conversely, if they are legitimate, then so, too, is the government. President Obama was absolutely on the mark to be skeptical of Russian intentions. ""Our strong preference would be for Mr. Putin to follow through on what is a glimmer of hope coming out of these Geneva talks,"" he said. ""But we're not going to count on it until we see it. And in the meantime, we're going to prepare what our other options are."" Even so, the Geneva document is important. It represents a standard against which the reduction of terrorist activities in eastern Ukraine and Russia's behavior toward them can be measured. Thus far, the evidence is neither encouraging nor discouraging. Russia insists the Ukrainians have to move first, the extremists in Sloviansk and Donetsk have insisted the agreement does not affect them, and their comrades in Kramatorsk have seized more buildings. On the other hand, extremists in Yenakievo abandoned the buildings they had occupied and the Donetsk separatists have promised to vacate two floors and the conference hall of the state province administration building. Regardless of the desultory response by Russia and its supporters, both the United States and Ukraine have, correctly, insisted that Russia stick to the agreement and convince its supporters in eastern Ukraine to surrender their arms and abandon the buildings they seized. Kiev has also agreed to an amnesty for those extremists who did not, as the document insists, engage in capital crimes. And Yulia Tymoshenko, the former prime minister-turned-political prisoner who is now running for president, has used the agreement as the basis for calling on the extremists to engage in roundtable discussions. The next week or two will demonstrate whether Russia is or is not serious about the Geneva agreement. If the terrorist groups do not abandon buildings and give up their arms, and if Russia does not stop infiltrating Russian intelligence agents into Ukraine, then Putin and Lavrov will effectively be declaring that they cannot be trusted and that their intentions in Ukraine are aggressive. Alternatively, if they adhere to the agreement, the document could lead to further forms of de-escalation, perhaps even including a permanent withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine's borders. Opinion: Why Geneva accord on Ukraine is tactical victory for Russia? Are Lavrov and Putin playing good cop-bad cop, hoping to convince the United States, the European Union, and Ukraine that Russia really is reasonable and has no aggressive intentions? If so, is this just a ploy to win time while war preparations continue? Or is their routine indicative of Russia's finally coming to its senses? Has Putin realized that invading or destabilizing Ukraine will bring him and Russia nothing except painful Western sanctions and the possible arming of Ukraine's military? Whatever the answer, it seems obvious that the West's consistent expressions of support for Ukraine and condemnation of Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea, along with Kiev's decision finally to resist Russian aggression, played some role in convincing Putin to have Lavrov make nice. The moral is clear: Talk tough and act tough, and Putin may just possibly listen.","Alexander Motyl: Putin belligerent about Ukraine as his minister signs accord .

"(CNN) -- After all the comparisons to George Zimmerman, Michael Dunn's fate turned out very differently. Dunn -- who also killed a black 17-year-old and said he did it in self-defense -- now faces decades in prison after he shot into an SUV full of teenagers during a spat over loud music. But this story is far from over. The prosecution wants another conviction. Dunn could appeal the convictions he already has. And once again, the country is at odds about whether race led to a young man's death. Meanwhile, Dunn's daughter told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that she's barely stopped crying since the verdict was handed down and she struggles to imagine ""life without him."" ""I love him so much. He's my best friend,"" Rebecca Dunn tearfully said. ""If he sees no other way than to bring out his gun, that's what he's going to do,"" she said. Both sides to keep fighting . After 30 hours of deliberation, a Florida jury on Saturday found Dunn guilty of three counts of attempted murder as well as a count stemming from shooting into the teens' vehicle. But jurors didn't convict him of murder for the death of 17-year-old Jordan Davis. State Attorney Angela Corey said prosecutors will seek a new trial in Duval County on the murder charge. ""Justice for Jordan Davis is as important as it is for any victim,"" said Corey, whose office also prosecuted Zimmerman for the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman was acquitted. Even without a murder conviction, Dunn faces a lengthy prison term. Each attempted second-degree murder conviction carries a minimum sentence of 20 years. There's also a possible 15-year sentence for the conviction on shooting into the teenagers' vehicle. ""You are looking basically at life in prison,"" Dunn's attorney Cory Strolla said. ""At 47 years old, that's a life sentence regardless of count one."" Strolla said he would challenge the convictions and would consider asking for a change of venue. ""For the retrial, I almost think we would have to,"" the attorney said. ""But again, I may not be the counsel at that point. We are a long ways away from that."" Opinion: An empty verdict, a hollow victory . Analysts disagree . Criminal defense attorney Carrie Hackett, who was not involved in Dunn's case, said she thinks the case may have been another example of overcharging. ""I think that there is an issue of overcharging because there's always a question when you bring a charge that involves intent,"" she told ""CNN Newsroom"" on Sunday. ""And in this first-degree murder charge, it's premeditation. When a jury has to look at -- did somebody plan? Was this strategic? Did they communicate this plan to somebody else? That's a situation where a jury could very easily get hung up on deciding, what was the person's intention?"" But another attorney, Mo Ivory, said she didn't think Dunn or Zimmerman was overcharged. ""What I do think is that the prosecution failed to give the jurors what they needed to know about that very intent,"" Ivory said. Ten bullets over music . On November 23, 2012, Michael Dunn pulled into a gas station in Jacksonville and parked next to a red Dodge Durango full of teenagers. Dunn didn't like the loud music -- ""rap crap,"" he called it -- coming from the teens' SUV. So he asked them to turn it down. What happened next depends on whom you believe. Dunn claimed Davis threatened him, and he took matters into his own hands after seeing what he thought was the barrel of a gun sticking out of the Durango. But prosecutors said Dunn lost control, firing three volleys of shots -- 10 bullets total -- at the SUV over music he didn't like. The prosecution also challenged what Dunn did next: He left the gas station and drove 40 miles to a bed and breakfast in St. Augustine. There, he walked his dog, ordered a pizza, then drank rum and cola. After learning almost six hours later that he had killed Davis, Dunn testified that he became ""crazy with grief,"" experiencing stomach problems for about four hours before taking a nap. ""My intent was to stop the attack, not necessarily end a life,"" he testified. ""It just worked out that way."" Yet his fiancee, Rhonda Rouer, testified that Dunn had never mentioned any weapon to her -- be it a shotgun, a stick, a barrel or a lead pipe. Police found a basketball, basketball shoes, clothing, a camera tripod and cups inside the teenagers' Durango, but no gun. And Dunn never called police. The first contact he had with them was at his home in Satellite Beach -- 130 miles south of St. Augustine -- as he was being apprehended. Arguing that he wasn't in a rational state of mind, Dunn admitted, ""It makes sense that I should have (contacted authorities). We didn't. I can't tell you why."" 'A little bit of closure' The lack of a murder conviction led protesters to march outside the Jacksonville courthouse, calling for Corey to lose her job. But Davis' mother, Lucia McBath, didn't express any anger when she spoke to reporters Saturday. She said her family is ""so very happy to have just a little bit of closure."" The verdict came the day before what would have been Jordan Davis' 19th birthday. ""It's sad for Mr. Dunn that he will live the rest of his life in that sense of torment, and I will pray for him,"" McBath said. ""And I've asked my family to pray for him."" CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin, Greg Botelho and Sunny Hostin contributed to this report.","NEW: Distraught daughter says she can't imagine life without her dad .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- A tsunami that followed a massive earthquake last month may have destroyed some of Japan's structures, but police say the honest practice of turning in lost items, especially cash, remains intact. Residents have turned in lost cash across the tsunami zone at a much higher rate than usual, the Miyagi Prefectural Police Department tells CNN. A police spokesman, who asked not to be identified, citing department policy, said he could not specify how much cash has been turned in to lost-and-found offices at police stations. But, he said, of the 24 police stations across Miyagi Prefecture, nine of them are on the Pacific coastline. Japan's cultural mores remain strong . Between March 12, the day following the earthquake and tsunami, and March 31, those nine police stations collected 10 times the amount of lost cash collected at the other 15 stations combined. Japanese children, from a young age, are taught to turn in any lost items, including cash, to police stations. The cultural practice of returning lost items and never keeping what belongs to a stranger has meant police departments like Tokyo's Metropolitan have an entire warehouse filled with lost shoes, umbrellas and wallets. Golfer donates winnings to Japan . In the tsunami zone, where personal items lie amid miles of rubble, it's meant that lost valuables have often gone directly to police, rather than the pocket of the finder. The lost cash hasn't been easy to handle, the Miyagi Prefectural Police Department says. Money found along with some identification is being returned, but officers have been able to return only 10% of the cash. Cash that wasn't in a wallet is left unclaimed at the police station. After three months, the person who turned in the cash is able to collect that lost money. But police say people are already waiving their rights to claim the cash when they turn it in. Flying drone peers into nuclear reactors . Unclaimed cash will eventually be sent to the Miyagi Prefectural Government, though police say they do not know how it will be used. Also found: Hundreds of safes that can't be opened. If the prefectural government allocates funding for opening the safes, police will start doing so. Prefectural police believe that these safes could contain not only currency, but bank books, stocks and land deeds, which could give a huge boost to the amount of lost money.","Japanese children are taught to return lost items to police .

"(CNN) -- Severe rain and thunderstorms pounded the Los Angeles suburbs again Saturday, causing more mudslides in Glendora and other towns. Mandatory evacuation orders for Glendora, Azusa, and Monrovia remained in effect, CNN affiliate KCAL reported. So far, no deaths have been reported. ""We've got people still evacuated only because we expect those thunderstorms, those high-intensity, short duration, type of rain storms,"" Glendora Police Chief Timothy Staab told KCAL. ""The hillsides are already soaked right now, and it may not take much to cause those mudslides to just come down out of the hills."" The hills can't hold water because so much vegetation was destroyed in wildfires and drought. ""These areas have the highest risk of being impacted by flooding/debris flows from rainfall due to the loss of vegetation from the foothills,"" the city of Glendora said in a statement to KABC, also a CNN affiliate. In Monrovia, people who choose not to leave will be asked to sign a form acknowledging they know the risk and assume liability for staying in their homes, KABC reported. The bad weather extended into Burbank, where rain and winds felled a 50-foot tree into an elderly woman's home. She escaped out the back door and wasn't injured. In Glendora, stories of close calls were easily found on Friday. Mario Vazquez grabbed his dog and got out of the way, as a stream of water and mud came gushing on to his streets. Since California has been in the middle of its worst drought in 100 years, it would seem that the sight of rain would be good news. But in Glendora and other towns in Los Angeles County, it wasn't. The rain has been much needed, but Friday's deluge -- coming down at more than an inch an hour at times -- landed on bone-dry hills scorched by recent wildfires in and around Los Angeles. With little vegetation left to stop them, walls of water have gushed into valleys below. They have spewed mud and debris into quiet residential streets, turning them into thick, brown creeks. More could hit before Saturday is up, the National Weather Service says. It has placed Los Angeles and Ventura counties under a flash flood watch. By the time it's over up to 6 inches will have landed on the foothills of Los Angeles County and as much as 10 inches on the ridge line. Weather weirdness . The West Coast rain is expected to end by Sunday, but will move eastward over the weekend. It will bring cold and snow to the central Plains to Ohio Valley late Saturday and Sunday and to the East Coast by Monday. Cities that will fall in the path of the heaviest snow include Louisville and Lexington, Kentucky; Pittsburgh and Philadelphia; and the Washington, D.C. area. Severe thunderstorms will be possible across central and eastern Texas and much of Louisiana on Sunday. Damaging thunderstorm winds will be the primary threat and a few tornadoes will be possible. Several cities will experience yo-yo temperatures. For example, the high in Atlanta will be 71 degrees on Sunday and drop to 54 on Monday. In New York, it will be 40 on Sunday and 26 on Monday; in Washington, 54 and 34, with a chance of 8-10 inches of snow. In Colorado, one person was killed and 20 were injured after a series of wrecks Saturday that involved an estimated 60 cars, Sonny Jackson, public information officer for the Denver Police Department, told CNN. Jackson said there were three different accident scenes within a short stretch of I-25 North, the first of which involved 45 cars. The storms brought the first rains since a powerful, persistent weather system collapsed that was keeping California parched. The same system was also at the root of a lot of strange weather around the globe -- all the way to Russia. A massive, sturdy ridge of high-pressure air had hovered over California, blustering rain clouds away. At the same time, it pushed the jet-stream way up into Canada and distorted it, said weather environmentalist Bill Lapenta. The stream then whipped south, pulling icy cold down into the Deep South, where it triggered snow storms. Then it dragged them up to Northeast, before crossing the Atlantic and bringing floods to Britain. It is also brought the unseasonably warm weather at the Olympic Games in Sochi, Lapenta said. The heavy California rains will not do much to alleviate the drought, according to the CNN Weather Center. A lot of the water is flowing right back out to sea, and the drought's effects have been enormous. Water reservoirs are running at minimum levels. For the first time in its history, the California Water Project - a system of canals and reservoirs that provide water to two thirds of the people in the state's Central Valley -- set its allocation for all of them to zero. Fire, then water . Floating in Glendora's silt were chunks of burned wood. Just weeks ago, flames were consuming the hills looming above them. Now, 1,000 homes in the valley have been ordered to evacuate, for fear of flash floods. Besides his dog, Vazquez left almost everything he owns behind to face the sludge. ""I got my laptop,"" he said. ""It's going to be fine. It's all replaceable."" It was probably quick thinking on his part. The rising waters caught many off guard. ""It wasn't like this 20 minutes ago,"" said resident Ryan Friend. He seemed aghast, as he watched a stream of thick brown pour down a street. CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report .","Rains are the first since the weather system behind the drought collapsed .

"(Parenting.com)  -- Is saving your child's cord blood a wise investment for future stem cell therapy? It wasn't until my second pregnancy that a brochure touting the benefits of umbilical cord blood banking caught my eye. It made a convincing case for giving my baby this potentially lifesaving health insurance should he develop a serious illness like cancer. I dialed the number and signed up with a private cord blood storage bank on the spot. I learned that in addition to the initial costs, I'll be paying an annual storage fee until my son is 18. If your family is considering making this decision, it's important to assess all the details. Here's a rundown of what you need to know: . Small price to pay . Cord blood is what remains in the vessels of the placenta and the portion of the umbilical cord still attached to it after birth. It's rich in blood-forming cells that can be used in transplants for patients with leukemia, lymphoma and many other life-threatening diseases. Parenting.com: 8 adorable ways your baby says 'I love you' Each private cord blood bank charges different fees. A recent study from the University of California, San Francisco, estimates the total average cost to be $3,620, which includes initial banking and storage for 20 years, at which point users must decide to either continue paying storage fees or donate or discard the cord blood. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) estimates the chances of a child needing her own cord blood stem cells in the future to be about one in 200,000. ""That means it's a very rare event for a family to bank cord blood and then actually use it,"" says Steven Joffe M.D.,associate professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. Parenting.com: 11 important baby cues you need to know . But who's to say that one family won't be yours? Gift of life . The AAP recommends discussing the issue with your doctor and storing cord blood at a private bank only if a family has knowledge of a sibling with a condition that could benefit from transplantation. Otherwise, families are encouraged to donate their newborn's cord blood to a public bank (if accessible in the area) for free, much like donating blood or an organ; in other words, the donated unit is not reserved for the family who provided it.

"(CNN) -- As the Ukraine players stood silent on the football field in Larnaca, Cyprus, they could be forgiven for allowing their minds to wander. This game, a friendly against the USA, was hardly significant given the scale of events which have taken place in Ukraine over the past fortnight. The contest, which was supposed to be played in Kharkiv, Ukraine, was moved to Cyprus where less than 2,000 people came to witness two teams go through the motions. It was not just the Ukraine players who may have been preoccupied, the performance of weakened USA side also raised questions over whether its squad had been affected by the late upheaval of switching the game. Some Ukrainian fans came with banners to support their country, while others appeared glad to have something to take their minds off what was happening at home. A 2-0 win thanks to goals from Andriy Yarmolenko and Marko Devic may not register on the national consciousness at this moment in time -- but it gave them a brief respite from the trouble their country has endured. History makers . Elsehwere, football history was being made as Kosovo made its long-awaited debut in international football. There were no national anthems -- there were no flags, and in the end, there were no goals. But that did not detract from an emotional evening in Mitrovica where Kosovo played its first ever FIFA sanctioned friendly. A goalless draw against Haiti in front of 17,000 people, came six years after Kosovo declared independence from Serbia. ""Bearing in mind our lack of preparation, the very difficult terrain ... and knowing the importance of this game we all have to be happy as we are all winners,"" Kosovo coach Albert Bunjaki told reporters. ""I am very happy with what I saw in this game. This is our first step in a very long journey ahead ... where our objective is (qualifying for the) World Cup. ""We have shown that we deserve to be part of world football."" Kosovo, which does not have a seat at the United Nations, is not a member of FIFA nor UEFA. It was only after negotiations with the Serbian Football Association that FIFA declared in January that Kosovo could partake in friendly games as long as it did not display any national symbols, sing its national anthem or have its flag raised. Mitrovica, which is home to some 5,000 soldiers in the NATO peace-keeping force, endured a 78-day barrage of air strikes between 1998-99. Record breaker . Elsewhere, Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice as Portugal thrashed Cameroon 5-1. Ronaldo scored his 48th and 49th goal for his country to become Portugal's all-time leading goalscorer. Meanwhile, France overcame Netherlands 2-0 in Paris thanks to goals from Karim Benzema and Blaise Matuidi, while Daniel Sturridge's late winner gave England a 1-0 victory against Denmark. Germany was made to fight all the way and was jeered from the pitch by supporters despite its 1-0 win over Chile. Mario Gotze scored the only goal of the game with the visitors hitting the crossbar and Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer making some impressive saves. ""That was a lucky win. I can understand the jeers and whistles,"" Germany captain Philipp Lahm told reporters. ""People pay good money to watch us and it's clear that we have a lot of work to do before the World Cup. But we always prepare well for a World Cup, so I am not worried."" World champion Spain defeated Italy 1-0 in Madrid courtesy of Pedro's strike. Brazil-born Diego Costa made his debut for Spain but failed to shine. Tim Cahill became Australia's all-time leading goalscorer after netting twice during his side's remarkable 4-3 defeat by Ecuador. Australia had cruised into a 3-0 lead before Ecuador launched a stunning second half fightback. Cahill, who now has 31 goals, leapfrogged former record holder Damian Mori. Elsewhere, Belgium was held to a 2-2 draw by Ivory Coast, Turkey defeated Sweden 2-1 and Russia overcame Armenia 2-0. Brazil . Neymar scored a stunning hat-trick as Brazil cruised to a 5-0 win over South Africa at Soccer City in Soweto. In the final warm-up game before its World Cup squad is announced, Brazil, which had won all four of its previous encounters against South Africa by a one-goal margin, was in prolific form. After Oscar had given Brazil a 10th minute lead, Neymar added two of his own before Manchester City midfielder Fernandinho struck a 30-yard screamer into the top corner. Neymar scored his third and Brazil's fifth in stoppage time from close range. Argentina . Lionel Messi vomited on the playing field during Argentina's goalless draw with Romania in Bucharest. The Barcelona forward was sick after seven minutes of the contest and looked out of sorts for the rest of the evening. Elsewhere, Colombia without injured talisman Radamel Falcao, was held to a 1-1 draw by Tunisia in Barcelona. Uruguay had to come from behind to secure a 1-1 draw in Austria.","Ukraine defeats USA in Cyprus .

"(CNN) -- Massachusetts investigators said Friday they think they have found the remains of Jeremiah Oliver, a 5-year-old boy who was missing for months before police were called. Though positive identification has not been made, Worcester County District Attorney Joseph D. Early Jr. said the body of a child found wrapped in a blanket inside a duffel bag near a central Massachusetts interstate matches the height and weight of Jeremiah. The case of Jeremiah Oliver was the result of what Massachusetts Department of Children and Families Commissioner Olga Roche called ""a serious failure."" Roche oversees the state's social workers, including those assigned to the Oliver household. ""The social worker assigned to this case did not conduct the required in-person, monthly checks on the family,"" Roche said in a statement when the boy was reported missing in December. ""And the supervisor failed to enforce that policy."" Roche fired both of them almost immediately. The last documentation of an interaction with Jeremiah was in May 2013, according to Department of Children and Families spokesman Alec Loftus. In June, Loftus said, the social worker was told that Jeremiah had moved to Florida to live with his grandmother, but did not follow up or verify that. The last visit to the home was in November, at which the social worker left behind a business card indicating it would be the Department of Children and Families' final visit, Loftus said. On December 2, Jeremiah's 8-year-old sister told counselors at her elementary school that her mother's boyfriend, Alberto Sierra, 22, had abused her, according to a police affidavit. After those statements, the girl and another brother were taken into protective custody, according to the affidavit. When police asked Elsa Oliver, 28, where her third child, Jeremiah, was, she told them he had moved to Florida, a law enforcement source involved in the investigation told CNN at the time. At a December 13 hearing before a state juvenile judge, Oliver was ""observed to have bruises, disheveled hair, and appeared to have been assaulted,"" according to court documents. She refused to divulge Jeremiah's whereabouts, according to the source, so she was arrested. In March, Oliver and Sierra, both of whom have been in custody since December, were indicted by a grand jury on charges related to Jeremiah's disappearance, as well as on charges of child abuse. Calls to the attorneys for both were not immediately returned Friday. An autopsy on the remains found Friday is expected to be completed over the weekend. CNN's Lawrence Crook III and Dave Stewart contributed to this report.","DA: Child's body found in duffel bag matches size of Jeremiah Oliver .

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi is widely regarded as the world's best footballer -- and now it seems the Argentina star is also unrivaled among his peers off the field. David Beckham has long been the sport's biggest earner even in his declining years, due to his lucrative endorsement deals, but the former Manchester United and Real Madrid superstar has been eclipsed by Barcelona's magician. The three-time World Player of the Year was unveiled by France Football magazine as the highest-earning player in soccer on Tuesday, collecting €33 million ($52 million) in wages and endorsements during 2011. The 24-year-old, who has scored 51 goals for the Catalan giants in all competitions, headed a list which placed Los Angeles Galaxy's former England captain Beckham in second on $50 million. Beckham recently signed a new contract with the Galaxy, and unveiled a clothing line with Swedish retailer H & M earlier this year. Messi's on-field rival Cristiano Ronaldo also featured highly. The Portugal forward's total earnings of $46 million in 2011 put him third ahead of Samuel Eto'o of Cameroon. Eto'o secured a lucrative move from Inter Milan to big-spending Russian team Anzhi Makhachkala in August 2011 and he has reportedly banked $37 million. Manchester United and England striker Wayne Rooney was fifth on the list with $32.6 million, while the Manchester City duo of Argentina's Sergio Aguero and Yaya Toure of the Ivory Coast took home $29.7 million and $27.8 million respectively. Completing the top 10 were Chelsea striker Fernando Torres ($26.4 million), Real playmaker Kaka ($24.5 million) and Bayern Munich's Germany captain Philipp Lahm ($22.6 million). France Football is one of Europe's leading sports magazines, and it formerly organized the Ballon d'Or awards for the continent's top achievers. The Ballon d'Or has now merged with ruling body FIFA's world player of the year awards.","France Football magazine declares Lionel Messi the world's highest-earning player .

"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- A Somali lawmaker was killed and another was injured when a bomb hidden in their car exploded while they were headed to a conference on security, officials said. Parliamentarian Isack Mohamed Ali, popularly known as Isack Rino, was killed, and lawmaker Mohamud Abdi-dhuuh was seriously injured, said Mohamed Abdiqadir Mohamed, district commissioner of Mogadishu's Hamarweyne district. Four passersby were also hurt. The parliamentarians were on their way to a national conference on security when the bomb, hidden under one of the car's seats, exploded. The Islamist rebel group Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for Monday's bombing in a statement posted to a pro-militant website. Prime Minister Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed said those behind the ""cowardly"" attack would be found.

"(CNN) -- Turkey shot down a Syrian fighter jet Sunday after the warplane strayed into its airspace, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said. ""Our F-16s went up in the air and shot that plane down. Why? Because if you violate my airspace, then from now on, our slap will be hard,"" Erdogan told supporters at a campaign rally. State-run media in Syria called the shoot-down an act of ""blatant aggression"" and said the downed plane was over northern Syria at the time. The pilot ejected and was rescued, SANA reported, citing a military source. The Turkish armed forces website reported that two Syrian planes were spotted and were warned four times about approaching Turkish airspace as they flew north in Syrian airspace. One plane left the area but the second plane continued, and entered Turkish airspace by approximately 1 kilometer (six-tenths of a mile). The plane turned west and continued to fly into Turkish airspace, according to the site. One of the two Turkish F-16s patrolling the area launched a missile at the Syrian plane and it crashed in the area of the town of Keseb, in Syrian territory near the border, Turkish armed forces said. Syrian government forces have battled rebel fighters in Syria's Latakia province since Friday morning after the opposition launched an offensive in the heavily Alawite populated areas of the country's Mediterranean coast. The province is still under government control despite some pockets of armed resistance. Warplanes have been striking at the opposition in Latakia, the home province of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, in hopes of preventing a rebel advance. One of the pitched battles on Friday occurred in Keseb, just 3 kilometers (2 miles) from Turkey. Sunday's SANA report said the Syrian jets were pursuing rebels in the area.

"(CNN) -- There are plenty of reasons to fall in love with a staircase. It's a home's conduit and connector. It ushers life along, makes a grand impression on visitors and serves as the backdrop for family memories. ""It's where my daughter took pictures for her first daddy-daughter dance,"" said Anisa Darnell, part of the Milk and Honey Home decorator team from Roswell, Georgia. Her home's staircase is also special to her because her grandfather posed with her daughter for a snapshot there before he passed away. The back staircase in Emily A. Clark's home is significant because it's mostly used by her kids. ""I've also caught them playing school on the little landing in the middle of the stairs."" Jacki Poovey and her husband designed their staircase to be a grand, welcoming part of their Cary, North Carolina home, but it's also at the heart of countless family memories. It still bears reminders of the time their puppy chewed every bit of molding from the edges of the newel post to the cap molding on the treads. ""It's a lived-in home,"" says Poovey. Massive undertakings, like DIY home renovations, can imbue a home's staircase with lasting impressions of the experience. ""If you paint three stories of spindles, you never forget it,"" Victoria Barnes said of the painstaking restoration she and her husband undertook in their 1890 Victorian home near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Barnes blogs about the ""really, really, really slow"" process of their work, which she calls wonderful and overwhelming. Christine Price, from Manchester, England, can relate, having spent 250 hours stripping, sanding and painting the staircase in her Edwardian home. ""The staircase is the first thing you see when you enter our home,"" she said. ""Now that it's restored it makes such a huge difference to the whole feel of the house."" For Jenna Burger, an interior designer and blogger, a staircase makeover led to an overhaul of every molding in her house. The staircase decor represents a significant change for her home's aesthetic, she said. ""I was unhappy with the worn, dated carpeted stairs before and desired a more updated, modern look,"" she said. So up went the carpet and down went paint and stain. Paint was also the key ingredient in Jae Vinson's economical transformation of her back staircase. With natural wood as the ""runner"" and crisp white paint on the sides of the treads, the previously dingy atmosphere was radically lightened. ""This is a garage entry staircase,"" Vinson said. ""It's something I use every single day going to and from my car. The space feels more welcoming now."" The feel of the staircase can be an important part of decorating a home, Darnell said. Obsessed with collages, she chose to decorate her staircase because it opened up to her family room and dining room, and its huge, blank wall stood out. ""I wanted it to be interesting and visually pretty,"" she said. Now photos, frames, decorative keys and even a lantern adorn the staircase, which she designed to be a tribute to her family. ""We have loved ones up there, wedding photos, engagement photos, our siblings, parents, grandparents, our daughters,"" she said. ""The staircase has personality."" Photo walls along staircases have come a long way since the ""wall of shame,"" full of unfortunate school photos and stilted professional portraits. Jill Hinson currently lives in Portland, Oregon, but her family moves often because of her husband's job. The black and white portraits she has taken of her two daughters since their births are a decorating element that makes each house they live in a home. ""The gallery wall tells the story of our family,"" Hinson said. ""Where we have been, the growth of our girls and what is personal and important to us."" The Hinsons moved into the Portland house two years ago, ""and as soon as I saw this gigantic wall going up the stairs, I new that it was the perfect place for a gallery wall."" Clark's staircase is lined with large and small works of art by her children, as well as canvases of their hand and footprints. ""Even my own kindergarten evaluation is framed and hung in the mix,"" she said. ""There's still lots of wall space, so this area will continue to be a work in progress. I'd love to fill it full of their colorful masterpieces,"" Clark said. The decor of the stairwell began with a decal of her favorite quote from the movie, ""The Help,"" which says ""You is kind. You is smart. You is important."" ""I love that quote,"" Clark said, ""and thought it was a sweet reminder for our kids as they bound up those steps, several times every day. It also reminds me of what they need to hear from me on a regular basis."" Are you obsessed with decorating your house? Show us your skills at CNN's Open House and your photo could be featured in next week's story. Our next focus: Inviting beds.","Staircases are important elements in home decor as well as family memories .

"(CNN) -- There is no evidence to suggest that the two men who used stolen passports to get aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 had anything to do with its disappearance Saturday as it was flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, an official said Tuesday. ""The more information we get, the more we're inclined to conclude that it was not a terrorist incident,"" Interpol Secretary General Ronald Noble told reporters Tuesday at his organization's headquarters in Lyon, France. Here's what we know about what happened, how it happened and why. WHO ARE THEY? The passengers are Delavar Seyed Mohammad Reza, 29, and Pouri Nourmohammadi, 18. They entered Malaysia on February 28 using valid Iranian passports. CNN obtained an iReport photo of what appears to be the two men with two of their friends. Metadata from the photo indicates that it was shot with an iPhone at 8:20 p.m. the night before the plane departed. CNN has blurred the faces of the other two men to protect their identities. WHAT HAPPENED? To fly out of Malaysia, Reza and Nourmohammadi used passports that were stolen in Thailand, a booming market for stolen passports. The passports belonged to citizens of Italy and Austria. ""Thailand remains a robust venue for the sale of high-quality, false passports (which includes altered, stolen passports) and other supporting documentation,"" said Paul Quaglia, who has been working in the region as a security and risk analyst for 14 years. The Italian, Luigi Maraldi, 37, told reporters he reported his passport stolen in August. The Austrian, Christian Kozel, 30, had his stolen in July 2013. Authorities said they don't know how Reza and Nourmohammadi came to possess the passports. HOW DID IT HAPPEN? On Saturday, Reza used the Italian's passport; Nourmohammadi used the Austrian's. According to Thai police, an Iranian man named Kazem Ali bought one-way tickets for the men, describing them as friends who wanted to return home to Europe. While Ali made the initial booking by telephone, Ali or someone acting on his behalf paid cash for the tickets, police said. The tickets were purchased at the same time from China Southern Airlines in Thailand's baht currency and at identical prices, according to China's official e-ticket verification system Travelsky. The ticket numbers are consecutive, implying they were issued together. Both were for travel from Kuala Lumpur to Amsterdam via Beijing. The ticket for the man who was using the Italian passport continued to Copenhagen, Denmark. The ticket for the holder of the Austrian passport ended in Frankfurt, Germany. Nourmohammadi was hoping to emigrate to Germany. The Iranian's mother had been expecting him to arrive in Frankfurt and contacted authorities when he didn't show up, said Malaysian Inspector General of Police Khalid Abu Bakar. ""If you read what the head of Malaysia police said recently, about (Nourmohammadi) ... wanting to travel to Frankfurt, Germany, to be with his mother, (this) is part of a human smuggling issue and not a terrorist issue,"" Interpol's Noble said. Interpol says the passports were recorded as stolen in its database. But no country had checked them against Interpol's list. Countries, not airlines, have access to Interpol's data, and many governments don't routinely check passports against the database. WHY DID IT HAPPEN? Phil Robertson, deputy director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch, has a plausible explanation. ""After the Green Revolution in Iran for human rights and democracy was crushed by Iranian authorities, there were many Iranians who fled to Malaysia,"" he told CNN's Kristie Lu Stout. Many Middle Easterners don't need a visa to enter Malaysia, which makes it a common destination for those seeking to emigrate for any number of reasons. But they can run into problems when they try to depart Malaysia for countries that do require visas. ""A stolen passport can be one way to do it,"" Robertson said. ""Unfortunately, this is quite common."" How do they get them? ""Often persons like this, if they are going to make a play to go to somewhere like Germany or other parts of Europe, they would need some sort of broker to help them make the arrangements,"" he said. ""So it's very possible you could have some sort of migrant smuggling group that's involved with this."" CNN's Tom Watkins, David Williams, Shimon Prokupecz, Katia Hetter, Karla Cripps, Khushbu Shah, Jethro Mullen and Jim Sciutto contributed to this report.","The two men were Iranians who used stolen passports .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti -- Extending U.S. trade preferences for Haiti could create as many as 100,000 jobs that would boost the earthquake-ravaged country's recovery, former President Bill Clinton said during a visit to the Haitian capital Monday. Clinton and former President George W. Bush visited Haiti on behalf of the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund, which was established to raise money for long-term recovery in the impoverished nation. In an exclusive interview with CNN, Clinton said that to help Haiti beyond the short term, the U.S. Congress should extend trade preferences that would allow Haiti to increase the amount of textiles Haiti can export into the United States. ""Because if we do, and we say we're going to do it for a longer period of time, we can get massive investment here (and) create tens of thousands or perhaps even 100,000 jobs,"" Clinton said. Korean businesses have already expressed an interest in investing in additional textile manufacturing facilities in Haiti if such an extension is passed, Clinton said. Brazil's foreign minister recently told Clinton that his country would follow in investing as well. On Monday, Clinton and Bush met with Haitian leaders, visited a camp for displaced Haitians and toured two small businesses in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. The U.S. presidents spoke with Haitian President René Préval at a news conference Monday. ""My mission is to work with President Clinton to remind the American people there is still suffering and work to be done here,"" Bush said. Clinton also said he supported the development of Haiti's domestic agriculture industry as a key to development and recovery. During the periods of the Clinton and Bush presidencies, the conventional wisdom was that by opening up countries like Haiti to subsidized agricultural imports from the United States and other developed nations, Haiti could industrialize faster. Both president's policies followed this logic, which Clinton now said was ultimately harmful and abandoned in recent years. Haitians were enthusiastic about seeing the American presidents, but shouted ""down with Préval,"" referring to their own leader. A 7.0-magnitude earthquake killed at least 220,000 people on January 12 and demolished large parts of Port-au-Prince. About 300,000 people were injured and 1 million were left homeless, government officials said. The two former leaders started the joint effort at the request of President Barack Obama. It aims to raise funds for relief and rebuilding work, economic opportunities and improving the quality of life for Haitians affected by the quake. Various celebrities have donated to the fund, including actor Leonardo DiCaprio who gave $1 million. The organization raised more than $37 million in the weeks after the disaster, according to its Web site. CNN's Lonzo Cook contributed to this report.","Clinton said Congress should extend trade preferences for Haiti .

"(CNN) -- The Jumpstart our Business Startups, or JOBS Act, is a win for entrepreneurship as well as bipartisan politics, and given economic hardship, unemployment and political bickering, it's time for a win. Next step: Declare victory and unleash an economic winning streak. On Thursday, President Barack Obama signed the JOBS Act with overwhelming bipartisan support. The bill makes it easier for startups to raise money, to stay private when they need to and to go public when the time is right. Overall, it promotes a pro-entrepreneurship agenda. What impact will the JOBS Act have? The bill's ""crowdfunding"" provision is getting the most attention. It allows entrepreneurs to raise small amounts of capital from large pools of individual investors. The Internet provides a tool for private citizens to form new marketplaces as social networks evolve to become more than just networks of friends. Web-based platforms such as Kickstarter and IndieGogo allow entrepreneurs to raise up to $1 million annually, as sanctioned by the new legislation. This provides a funding source for startups that might otherwise have never made it past the business plan stage. Many entrepreneurs finance their fledgling businesses with their own lines of credit, sometimes backed by the value of their homes. With the recent recession, lines of credit have been difficult to obtain, and the value of many homes has decreased. Crowdfunding opens a new source of capital, especially for underserved communities. Crowdfunding could invigorate local economies outside of Silicon Valley and other entrepreneurial centers. Further, the JOBS Act allows companies to stay private longer, which gives entrepreneurs the flexibility to decide how and when it's best to go public. Previously, companies with more than 500 investors were mandated to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The JOBS Act raises this number to 2,000 investors and excludes employees as shareholders in that number. This enables private companies to build revenue and develop sophistication before entering the capital markets. When the time is right, the JOBS Act makes it easier for a new class of ""emerging growth companies"" to go public. For businesses with less than $1 billion in revenue, the number of audited financial statements required is reduced. Young, high-growth firms are allowed up to five years to comply with certain Sarbanes-Oxley Act disclosures. Sarbanes-Oxley compliance is much more onerous for smaller companies than it is for larger entities such as General Electric, Johnson & Johnson or IBM. The JOBS Act helps smaller companies conserve resources. It also provides an ""IPO On-Ramp"" during which time emerging growth companies can protect sensitive information and competitive trade secrets. Of course, there is concern about the potential for financial fraud. Will there be scams? There always are. Will Uncle Ned lose his shirt chasing the latest crowdfunded investment idea? To protect investors, the JOBS Act includes an amendment that mandates companies to provide basic financial information to investors before seeking crowdfunding. It also requires third-party intermediaries, in the form of websites managing crowdfunding shares, to register with the SEC. The amendment also sets limits on the amount of money an individual can invest to prevent investors from taking too much risk. Individuals with an annual income or net worth of less than $100,000, for example, would be limited to investing 5% of their income in crowdfunding. In addition, Obama called on the Treasury Department, Small Business Association and Justice Department to monitor the new legislation closely and report regularly on their findings. Certainly, the JOBS Act is a win for entrepreneurs in America. But it is only a first step. The bill will help innovators reduce burdensome regulation and gain faster access to capital to grow their startup businesses. But we need to do more. We need to overhaul immigration to welcome foreign-born founders. According to a December study by the National Foundation for American Policy, immigrants founded or co-founded almost half of the 50 top venture-backed companies in the United States, and on average these companies created 150 jobs. We must enhance commercialization of research out of U.S. universities. One way to do this is to adopt a standardized licensing agreement for spinoffs. Another way is to make open-technology licensing a condition for universities to receive federal research dollars. Currently, the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 requires faculty innovators to work through their own university technology licensing offices. This creates significant delays. To catalyze our innovation economy, we need to increase collaboration between startups and larger corporations. One such example is the NYSE Big StartUp initiative that partners large companies with small businesses to provide corporate assistance with accounting support, legal services, marketing infrastructure and financial training. Small companies often lack resources to take their business to scale. Corporate America can help catapult fledgling entrepreneurs to the next level. America's competitive position in the world will increasingly depend on our entrepreneurs. The JOBS Act provides momentum. Let's not stop here. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Amy M. Wilkinson.","Amy Wilkinson says JOBS Act is a win for small business, bipartisanship, economic growth .

"(EW.com) -- In the posters for ""Divergent,"" Shailene Woodley has been given the stylized bod of a comic-book sci-action vamp, and her features are as coolly chiseled as her physique. But in the movie version of Veronica Roth's 2011 novel, Woodley, I'm glad to say, is a lot more recognizably human, and that goes for her acting too. Her character, Tris, spends most of the film learning to leap and toss knives and risk death like a badass, and when she puts those skills to the test battling her society's corrupt leaders, there's no doubt that she's a superior, market-tested YA role model, like Katniss in ""The Hunger Games."" But she is also, as Woodley plays her, an intensely vulnerable and relatable character. Tris, a.k.a. Beatrice, has been raised as a member of Abnegation, one of five factions in a walled dystopia that was formerly Chicago and still looks, strikingly, like a semiruined concrete-playground version of that city. The members of Abnegnation dress in plain gray frocks, like the Amish, and they're all about puritan self-sacrifice. The other four factions are Erudite (defined by their transcendent knowledge), Candor (who are compulsively honest), Amity (the naturally peaceful), and Dauntless (the fearless tattooed warrior jocks in black â€” in other words, the sect that anyone cool would want to be part of). Beatrice and her peers have the right to choose a -faction for themselves (it's like picking a college â€” you can go to Yale even if your folks didn't). But when she takes the test to learn which faction she's best suited for, it turns out that she's in the rare forbidden -category known as Divergent, which means she has the qualities of three factions at once: Abnegnation, -Erudite, and Dauntless. It may sound silly to say she's an outlaw because she's self-sacrificial, brilliant, and strong all at the same time, but what's really forbidden is -independent thought. Woodley, through the delicate power of her acting, does something compelling: She shows you what a prickly, fearful, yet daring personality looks like when it's nestled deep within the kind of modest, bookish girl who shouldn't even like gym class. Tris chooses to become part of Dauntless not because she has any special athletic skill but because it's her nature to go for broke. The first half of ""Divergent"" is a lean, exciting basic-training thriller, with Tris willing herself to do things like jump aboard speeding trains and fight with her bare knuckles. Woodley, at every turn, lets us feel as if we're in her shoes, not so much Dauntless as thrillingly daunted. The second half of the movie goes on a bit, with too many rote combat scenes. Yet the director, Neil Burger (the fanciful craftsman who made ""Limitless"" and ""The Illusionist""), keeps you invested, staging a rise-of-the-savior-heroine plot so that it seems less ritualistic than it does in the Hunger Games films. It helps that the drill sergeant, named Four, is played by Theo James, who's like an unflaky James Franco with a surly hint of T-shirt-era Brando; he brings off the neat trick of playing a hardass who is also a heartthrob. And it's nice to watch Kate Winslet go full ice-blood fascist as the Erudite leader who makes a scarily smart case for a society rooted in the fine art of -control. In many ways, she sounds similar to a movie executive, so I'm glad to see the launch of a dystopian franchise in which individuality, as embodied by Shailene Woodley, looks like it could mean something beyond hiply propping up the status quo.

"(CNN) -- When someone tells you to go jump in a lake, sometimes it's best to take their advice. For one golfer, it saved him from a world of hurt. At first, Pablo Larrazabal thought nothing was out of the ordinary when he swatted an insect away from his face at a tournament in Malaysia on Friday. The next thing he knew, he was being attacked by a swarm of hornets. ""They were three times the size of bees,"" said the Spaniard. ""They were huge and 30 or 40 of them started to attack me big time. ""I didn't know what to do. My caddy told me to run, so I start running like a crazy guy, but the hornets were still there, so the other players told me to jump in the lake. ""I ran to the lake, threw my scorecard down, took off my shoes and jumped in the water. ""It was the scariest moment of my career, for sure. I've never been so scared."" Thankfully, after some treatment, the 30-year-old was able to continue. Remarkably, he birdied the hole he was on when the attack occurred -- the 14th -- then completed his second round in four-under-par 68, which meant he made the halfway cut of the European Tour event. ""The referees and a doctor took me aside and gave me a couple of injections and told me to relax,"" Larrazabal said on the European Tour website. ""After the injections I felt a lot better and could continue. Without the help of the referees I couldn't have finished the round, because I was in no state to play golf. ""Tomorrow it will be very, very scary to play that hole. I'm not sure what I'm going to do, but hopefully I will play it as quickly as I can."" Larrazabal, ranked 65th in the world, has won one tournament this year -- at January's Abu Dhabi Championship, where he beat major winners Rory McIlroy and Phil Mickelson by one shot to claim the $2.7 million first prize. He will go into the weekend at the Malaysian Open tied for 25th place, trailing leader Lee Westwood by 11 shots. The Englishman, a former world No. 1, followed up his opening 65 with a 66 to be four clear of European Ryder Cup teammate Nicolas Colsaerts. The Belgian was tied for second with 327th-ranked Antonio Lascuna of the Philippines, who finished 90th in the Kuala Lumpur tournament last year.","""I've never been so scared,"" says golfer Pablo Larrazabal .

"(CNN) -- Scientists have found a wide-eyed primate -- a clawed fur ball that fits snugly in one hand -- in the first live sighting in more than 80 years of a creature that some thought was extinct. ""It was truly amazing,"" one scientist said. ""I couldn't conceive that we had actually caught one."" Over a two-month period, scientists working in Lore Lindu National Park on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi caught and released three pygmy tarsiers. They bear a striking resemblance to the Furby, an electronic toy that spoke its own fantasy language and dominated children's wish lists in the late 1990s. They caught two males and one female, said Sharon Gursky-Doyen, a Texas A&M University anthropology professor who led the expedition. The group spotted a fourth -- high in the tree canopy -- but were unable to catch it. The species had not been observed alive in more than eight decades, since they were collected for a museum in 1921. Many scientists had believed them to be extinct until eight years ago, when two scientists trapping rats in Sulawesi accidentally trapped and killed one. ""I needed to go myself ... to confirm in my own mind,"" whether they were there, Gursky-Doyen told CNN on Wednesday, after recently returning from Indonesia. And, on the second night of trapping in August on moss-covered, chilly Mt. Rore Katimbo, her group caught the first small nocturnal creature in a mist net. ""It was truly amazing,"" she said. ""My whole body was shaking ... I couldn't conceive that we had actually caught one."" The second trapping didn't come until three weeks later, but that first sighting ""kept us going,"" Gursky-Doyen said, amid the cold, drenched conditions. The pygmy tarsier, or Tarsius pumilus, weighs about 50 grams (1.7 ounces), and has dense fur, large, protruding eyes. In addition to seeming as a living, breathing version of the Furby, it also appears as though it ought to have had appeared in the 1984 movie ""Gremlins."" Unlike other primates, the pygmy tarsier -- endemic to a specific area of Indonesia -- has claws instead of nails on its fingers. It is half as big as the Philippines tarsier, which has similar features. For their part, the pygmy tarsiers may have been more frightened than elated at being discovered. ""I was bit once, but I take responsibility for that,"" Gursky-Doyen said, explaining that the animal nipped her as she was trying to attach a radio collar -- to track its movement -- to its neck. The task isn't an easy one, she said, because the animal can swivel its head around 180 degrees. Despite another person helping to hold the animal still, he turned and bit her, she said. They have ""pointy, triangular teeth,"" she said. It was ""very painful."" But for the most part, they appeared very ""passive,"" she said. Other tarsier species give alarm calls, but these didn't, at least nothing that a human could hear, she said. Gursky-Doyen said she would like her graduate student, Nanda Grow, also on the expedition, to return to the field site for her dissertation, to learn more about the number of animals and how altitude and other variables affect them. ""I do believe that the density of these animals is very low,"" she said, noting that many villages are located within Lore Lindu National Park. ""That threatens them,"" she said.","Pygmy tarsiers thought to be extinct for more than eight decades .

"(CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama begins a key European trip Monday during a pivotal moment of his presidency. He will use a series of key meetings this week to re-assert U.S. global leadership at a time when the United States, and the wider West, has appeared to be on the back foot following Russia's incursion into Ukraine and subsequent annexation of Crimea. The immediate focal point will be an emergency meeting of the G7 which will take place at The Nuclear Security Summit (NSS) Monday and Tuesday in The Hague. The G7 session will convene on the margins of the NSS to discuss next steps for tackling the crisis in Ukraine, including deterring the prospect of Russian military moves into eastern and southern Ukraine. The agenda here is at least two-fold: bolstering the new leadership in Kiev, and threatening further economic punishment of Moscow. On the former, Ukraine signed last Friday an agreement on closer economic and political cooperation with the EU. Moreover, Washington has confirmed that it is providing Kiev with ""non-lethal assistance"" that could include intelligence and satellite imagery, and/or key equipment such as night-vision goggles. Coordinated new waves of sanctions against Russia will also be discussed. The United States and the 28 member EU have already imposed travel bans and selective asset freezes against key Russian and Crimea officials, and a bank deemed to have close ties with the Kremlin. It is recognized, however, that further escalation may be needed, and Obama will seek to find consensus on this given the differing bilateral interests with Russia of the G7 countries. Potential measures include widening the punitive measures against targeted Russian and Crimean officials and institutions; an arms embargo; Moscow's expulsion from the G8; and wider, more politically sensitive economic sanctions. The scene was set for the latter last Thursday when Obama signed an executive order expanding the U.S. government's authority to take financial and trade measures with the European Union against key Russian industries. In the face of some strident recent domestic U.S. criticism of his foreign policy, Obama will also have platforms to showcase presidential leadership at both the EU-U.S. summit on Wednesday, and the NSS where he will meet with more than 50 national leaders including Chinese President Xi. Nuclear terrorism . The NSS, which will focus on measures to enhance security of nuclear material stockpiles and facilities across the world, is the brainchild of Obama who believes that nuclear terrorism represents ""the most immediate and extreme threat to global security."" The downturn in relations between Russia and the West is unfortunate here given that Moscow is a pre-eminent player in attempts to counter the nuclear terrorism threat. Indeed, this issue first came prominently onto the international radar screen following the collapse of the Soviet Union when major concerns were raised about safeguarding its nuclear weaponry. More recently, the urgency of tackling this agenda was given impetus by the September 2001 attacks. This was widely interpreted as a ""wake-up call"" about the possibility that a terrorist group could detonate a small nuclear weapon, or a radiological dispersal device (a so-called ""dirty bomb""). While the conventional wisdom is that the probability of a major nuclear terrorism event is very low, the consequences would be so dramatic that it remains a major pre-occupation of the international community. Given the difficulties of terrorist groups obtaining weapons grade material, perhaps the bigger danger is a dirty bomb attack. Here, conventional explosives would be used to spread radiation from a radioactive source. Such radioactive sources are relatively widely available, including at hospitals. Only last December, law enforcement authorities in Mexico discovered a vehicle believed to have been stolen by thieves which contained radioactive medical materials that could have been used to power a dirty bomb. Nuclear Security Summit goals . Amongst the ambitious goals for the NSS include: ratification of the amended Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material by more countries to ensure that the amendment enters into force as soon as possible; more frequent reviews of state security structures by the International Atomic Energy Authority; national registration and protection of highly radioactive sources (e.g. medical equipment); and a greater role for industry in nuclear security to enhance the security culture and existing regulations. Following up on the summit, a significant body of further work will be needed to achieve Obama's stated ambition to ""secure all vulnerable nuclear material around the world"" during his presidency. The next NSS will be in Washington DC in 2016 and will coincide with his last year in the White House. Given recent criticism of his foreign policy, and conscious of his place in history, Obama sees enhancing global nuclear security as a key part of his presidential legacy, especially following the agreement he signed with Moscow on the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (NEW START) which will see both countries reduce their deployed nuclear arsenals. Building upon this success, he will now seek to secure the strongest possible outcomes from the NSS process, and also push hard for a comprehensive nuclear deal to be reached with Iran to follow-up on last year's breakthrough preliminary agreement.

"(CNN) -- ""You are making our work here very difficult"". It is a side remark, uttered politely and quietly. Near the start of the ""Kony 2012"" video, a man says this. If you have seen the video -- and chances are you have -- you might have missed this small interaction just four minutes into the film. The man who is worried about having his work made more difficult tries to interrupt the filmmaker who is interviewing a child in the northern Ugandan city of Gulu. I don't know who that man was or what he was trying to do. The footage is so old it will be hard to establish. But his words turned out to be prophetic: ""You are making our work here very difficult."" Jason Russell, the most prominent face of the group Invisible Children, has made the work of bringing about change very difficult indeed. Invisible Children's campaign is a well-packaged call to leave the state of affairs untouched; their message seems so modern because their tools are. The point made is conformist: Fight violence with violence, dismiss intricate steps of social change and make a narrow ideology mass-compatible by having millions of unquestioning people raise their fists in support. For the U.S., Europe and other generally comfortable corners of the world, this is a worrying picture of a mass culture that easily falls for propaganda. For the world's less cozy places, to which the areas in which the Lord's Resistance Army has been active belongs, mass support for maintaining the status quo is a tragedy. So what is the status quo? Well, it is indeed complicated. But suffice to say that for decades, this has been an intricate mix of violence that causes more violence, a violent government that garners international support by vilifying one side of the conflict, and international attention often reduced to uninformed celebrities expressing shock and horror. Crucially, it has been part of Ugandan government propaganda to make this war seem like the tour of personal madness of one man: Joseph Kony. This is the status quo that needs to be challenged. What is the Invisible Children campaign doing? Advocating fighting violence with more violence? Garnering international support for a violent government? Having uninformed celebrities express shock and horror? Focusing this conflict on one person only? Having millions of people punch the air in cries for war and U.S. troops? And to what end? The campaign advocates a narrow worldview. It is also a costly one. From 2006 to 2008, the situation regarding the conflict between the LRA and the government of Uganda looked promising. Violence subsided. The LRA left Uganda because they had signed up for peace talks -- slow, unpredictable and often irritating peace talks that did not come with a success guarantee. But the peace talks made the situation almost instantly better. Two years of talking cost less than $15 million. There was no video with a mass appeal to the world to support the peace process. There was no call to the U.S. government to stop working with the Ugandan army, one of the perpetrators of violence in this war. The Invisible Children -- who visited the peace talks at various points -- decided not to take this slow and long-winded attempt at peace seriously. Invisible Children believe in war. They manage to make millions of people believe war is the best way to bring peace. Peace talks turned into war in late 2008: Kony was reluctant to sign the agreement as it stood at the time. Invisible Children supported U.S. involvement; the U.S. supported the Ugandan army in upping the military pressure. Social change through peaceful means was given a deadline when the Ugandan army used U.S. planning help to bomb the LRA camp. War, the status quo, was back on. In the first few days of the ill-conceived military operation, a fighter plane worth millions of dollars was lost and thousands of people displaced or killed. War is a lot more expensive than peace. War as advocated through this campaign has few subtleties. Video propaganda coupled with action kits and precise orders for what to do next leaves little room for thinking. A focus on one man who simply does not hold the reins in this conflict in the way that Invisible Children portray is myopic. Social change needs subtleties. It needs room for negotiation, compromises, and shifting the debate. It also needs really boring things: tedious days of discussion and engagement, mind-numbingly unsexy drafting of agreements, and an open mind at all stages. And it needs very invisible people committed to working away on these things through small, but important contributions. These are not people who buy action kits and re-tweet. These are people who have just been told by the Invisible Children campaign that hanging a poster and wearing a bracelet is a better way to bring about social change, that the difficult political context in which they operate everyday, often at great personal risk and expense, can easily be solved if one man is removed.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A blogger believed to be the target of the attack that brought down Twitter Thursday has told CNN the cyber assault was politically motivated and timed to coincide with the one-year anniversary of the Russia-Georgia conflict. Cyxymu's Twitter account was said by Facebook's security officer to be the target of Thursday's attack. ""Cyxymu"" has identified himself to CNN as ""George,"" and the owner of the Twitter, Facebook and LiveJournal accounts named by Facebook's security officer as being the target of a coordinated online attack. George told CNN in an e-mail his username is ""the name of my home town, the capital of Abkhazia (Sokhum) written in Russian and typed in Latin letters."" He confirmed he is 34 years old and based in Tbilisi, Georgia, but declined to give further information which may reveal his identity. George told CNN his blogposts may have ""irritated"" someone enough to incite a cyber attack. His recent posts include: ""How Russia was preparing military agression (sic) against Georgia, how they were training soldiers and mobilizing military equipment, what kind of provocations were carried out by the separatists prior to the war."" ""Seems somebody did not like such a chronicle of events,"" he told CNN. ""I was also writing about all reforms implemented in Georgia in recent times so that all people outside Georgia could have proper information."" He said the main purpose of his blogs was to promote the resumption of relations between the Abkhazian and Georgian people. ""I assume the above-mentioned could irritate those who are the authors of the given cyber attack and who will never accept the idea of the United, independent, democratic and prosperous Georgia,"" he said. Twitter -- a micro-blogging site where users post 140-character messages to their followers -- went down for around two hours Thursday. Twitter said the site's blackout was caused by a ""denial-of-service attack,"" which likely means a hacker used a number of infected computers to send enough automated requests to the site to overwhelm it. Facebook and LiveJournal, a blogging site, also experienced problems. In a statement, Facebook said the attack, ""resulted in a short period of degraded site experience for some visitors. No user data was at risk and the matter is now resolved for the majority of users."" Facebook security officer Max Kelly told CNet news Thursday the attack was designed to silence an outspoken blogger known by the username, ""cyxymu."" ""It was a simultaneous attack across a number of properties targeting him to keep his voice from being heard,"" Kelly told CNet. ""We're actively investigating the source of the attacks and we hope to be able to find out the individuals involved in the back end and to take action against them if we can."" The Georgian government has confirmed it's investigating potential links between the attacks and the user in Tbilisi, Georgia, according to Shota Utiashvili, head of the Department of Information and Analysis at the Ministry of the Interior. Although they had no details yet, the spokesman said there were suspicions that the attack may have come from Russia, but it will take ""some more time"" before they could reach any conclusions. The Interior Ministry could not confirm the user's identity. Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant at computer security firm Sophos told CNN it was unlikely the attacker intended to cripple Twitter, or to cause widespread disruption. ""I suspect that whoever did this didn't really want to bring down the likes of Twitter and cause problems for those other sites, they just wanted that material off because they objected to what it was saying, perhaps for a political reason,"" he said. Cluley said Thursday's attacks started with a spamming campaign, called a ""joejob,"" which is designed to tar a victim's online reputation by appearing to be the source of a wave of spam. ""The first thing they did was they started spamming out e-mails, using his name, pointing to Web pages he has on those Web sites,"" Cluely said. ""Some people have speculated that the 'denial-of-service' happened after people received these e-mails and clicked on the links. But I think that's poppycock. I don't think many people would have clicked on the links. ""I think that instead what happened is that whoever had a vendetta against it took it one stage further and decided to launch a 'denial-of-service' attack against his pages, hoping of course that the pages would be taken down and he'd been taken off these sites."" Cluely said ""denial-of-service"" attacks were reported last year when Russia deployed troops to South Ossetia to repel Georgian forces. ""We saw a series of denial of service attacks coming both from Russia and from Georgia a year ago when the conflict took off."" Read more about recent conflict in the region . ""It's not unusual now, when there's a tense part of the world where there's conflict happening, for hackers to take matters into their own hands and to take potshots like this,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- You'll find his name and initials everywhere you go at the French Open -- the famous green and brick red logo stamped on everything from parasols and caps to towels and tennis balls. But ask most people who Roland Garros was and they'll tend to double fault. ""For a lot of people in France and abroad, Garros is a tennis man, or a sometime president of the French Tennis Federation (FFT),"" says Michael Guittard, head of collections and cultural mediation at the FFT. ""Everybody knows the name of Roland Garros, but nobody knows who he was. That's why we have an exhibition to explain that he is not a tennis champion, but a hero of World War One."" Garros' elevated status wasn't earned down in the trenches, but up in the skies above the Western Front, as the exhibition at the FFT museum entitled ""Moi... Roland Garros"" explains. Born in 1888 on the French island of RÃ©union in the Indian Ocean, Garros had won fame before the war, notably becoming the first man to fly across the Mediterranean Sea in September 1913. The following year, he switched from peacetime record-breaker to intrepid war pilot. Pioneering propellers . Although he never reached the status of flying ace -- he is officially credited with shooting down four enemy aircraft during the war -- Garros gained notoriety another way by developing a means of allowing a machine gun to be fired forward through a plane's propeller arc. ""He was an early pioneer in the development of fighter aviation,"" says Peter Jakab, chief curator at the U.S.'s Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. His method of attaching wedge-shaped steel plates to the propeller blades may have been crude, but it worked, says Jakab. ""The rate of fire was that most of the bullets would miss the propeller, but every so often one would strike it. So this was a way to deflect the bullets from the propeller,"" Jakab told CNN. ""It wasn't very efficient, but in the very early months of the war when airplanes were either defenseless or carrying hand-held weapons, this technique made his aircraft more lethal than anything flying. ""Over a very short period of time he shot down a number of German airplanes and created quite some terror among the German pilots."" Piloting his Morane-Saulnier, Garros' first victory came at the beginning of April 1915 and two more quickly followed. But his luck ran out later that month when a clogged fuel line forced him to crash-land behind enemy lines. Captured by the Germans, Garros remained a prisoner of war for almost three years before escaping in February 1918. Short-lived success . Undeterred by the prospect of another incarceration or worse, Garros was soon airborne again, this time piloting a SPAD biplane. The pioneering airman showed he had lost none of his shooting skills as he downed his fourth German plane of the war in early October 1918. But it wasn't long before disaster struck. On October 5, a day before his 30th birthday and five weeks before Armistice Day on November 11, Garros was shot down and killed near the French town of Vouziers, close to the Belgian border. His demise came at the hands of a German airman flying a Fokker D VII plane fitted with a synchronization gear that stopped bullets hitting the propeller altogether. Designed by Dutch aircraft manufacturer Anthony Fokker, the device was far more efficient than Garros' earlier deflector plates and caused numerous deaths of allied airmen when introduced in mid-1915 -- prompting the British press to coin the phrase the ""Fokker Scourge."" Garros had, it seems, become a victim of the rapid progress that he had started. ""What you see in the First World War is this laboratory or crucible for development of what we know as air power today -- from a tactical/mission perspective as well as a technical design perspective,"" Jakab says. ""A guy like Garros was one of the early pioneers of developing a tactic in an aircraft-specific role. But ideas of formation flying and how squadrons would tactically engage had evolved after he was in prison. ""So when he came out, he was still pursuing fighter aviation like he had done in 1915, but it was a different ball game by that point,"" Jakab said. ""He was surpassed by the war and by this technique that he had pioneered. But he was a great war hero."" It was a status reaffirmed a decade after his death when a new stadium built to host the international teams tennis tournament now known as the Davis Cup was named in Garros' honor. After beating the U.S. at Philadelphia's Germantown Cricket Club in 1927, France, led by the ""Four Musketeers"" (Jean Borotra, Jacques Brugnon, Henri Cochet and Rene Lacoste) went on to win five consecutive Davis Cup titles at the new stadium in Paris' 16th arrondissement beginning in 1928 -- the same year the French Open was first held at the clay-court venue. Pre-war records . Garros' high-standing among the French public wasn't built solely on his efforts during the war. Prior to 1914, he had been a highly successful member of a new burgeoning aircraft community which had rapidly grown in the wake of the Wright Brothers' (Wilbur and Orville) first powered flight at Outer Banks, North Carolina in December 1903. ""A lot of people don't realize how much aeronautical activity was going on before the First World War,"" says Jakab. France was at the heart of this development, Jakab says, noting Louis Bleriot's first crossing of the English Channel in an airplane in July 1909 which was followed a month later by the world's first air meet at Reims in the Champagne-Ardenne region. ""It took place over a two-week period and upwards of 200,000 people came out to see the flying,"" Jakab says. ""This was not an obscure event and by 1910, '11, '12 you have the foundation of an aircraft industry in Europe not just in France, but the UK, Italy, Germany and Russia."" As the FFT exhibition notes, Garros was inspired to take up flying after attending the Reims event and it wasn't long before he was making a name for himself. In 1912, two years after making his first flight, he won the prestigious Circuit de Anjou race before becoming the first man to fly across the Mediterranean Sea on September 23 the following year, as Flight International magazine reported. ""Tuesday last saw Roland Garros achieve his ambition of flying across the Mediterranean from France to Africa... ""Leaving the Frejus Aerodrome at St. Raphael at 5.45 a.m., and steering straight across the Mediterranean, over Sardinia, he made a safe landing in Bizerta, in Tunisia at 1.45 p.m. The distance between the two points is about 460 miles, and after his eight hours flight there still remained in the tank five liters of petrol."" ""The 1913 flight across the Mediterranean was his great flight,"" Jakab says. ""From a pre-war point of view, he was one of the key pioneering aviators who established the viability of the airplane as a technology in terms of these long-term flights."" These days, the only aviators you are likely to find at Roland Garros stadium are pairs of sunglasses perched on patron's noses court side at Philippe Chatrier (who actually was a former FFT president). The pilot's story may be lost on most of them, but 100 years after the Great War began, Garros' fighting spirit lives on in more frivolous forms of battle. ""Garros had two big qualities -- a lot of courage and a lot of determination,"" Guittard says. ""Those two words are perfect for our champions."" The ""Moi... Roland Garros"" exhibition can be seen at the FFT museum at Roland Garros stadium. Entry is free of charge to ticket-holders during the tournament.","Early 20th-century aviator was credited with developing fighter aviation .

"(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho's Chelsea exerted a tactical stranglehold on hosts Atletico Madrid to earn a goalless draw in the first leg of their Champions League semifinal Tuesday. If the expectant capacity crowd in the Vicente Calderon were anticipating a night of free-flowing football then they would have quickly become disillusioned as Mourinho's men restricted Atletico to few chances. Chelsea, who entertain the Spanish League leaders in the return leg in London next Wednesday, also had to cope with losing goalkeeper Petr Cech and captain John Terry to injury in each half, but Atletico were unable to take full advantage. After central defensive lynchpin Terry limped off, Atletico had their best spell with Gabi forcing a fine save from Cech's veteran replacement Mark Schwarzer while Raul Garcia and substitute Arda Turan headed wide from Juanfran crosses. Chelsea's Fernando Torres, returning to the club where he spent six successful years, cut a lone figure up front for the English Premier League side and aside from one fine run and shot had barely a sight of goal. Torres' Atletico counterpart, Diego Costa, who has been linked with a big money move to Chelsea, was also largely frustrated aside from two late headers, the first blocked by Gary Cahill, the second, better chance, headed straight at the excellent Schwarzer. The 41-year-old Australian told ITV Sport after the draw that it had been a job well done. ""We knew if we could match their determination, that our quality could come through. We didn't create too many chances, but we did a good job tonight,"" he said. ""It's very tough for the second leg but we've got to take each game as it comes. Before that, we've got a massive game at Liverpool on Sunday."" Chelsea, who must win at league leaders Liverpool to revive fading English Premier League title hopes, will be hoping to reach a second Champions League final in three years with their home leg against Atletico still to come. But they will have to do without Cech, who dislocated his shoulder after falling awkwardly in tipping over an early corner, and Terry, who limped off in the 72nd minute. The bad news was confirmed by Mourinho. ""Petr Cech's season over. Don't ask me technically, but season over,"" he said. ""And John (Terry) -- we have to play the final for him to play with us."" Chelsea will also be missing midfielders Frank Lampard and Jon Obi-Mikel for the second leg after picking up yellow cards, the same fate also befalling Atletico's Gabi. Atletico, who were beaten finalists to Bayern Munich in the 1974 final of Europe's premier club competition, will return to league action with a match against Valencia Sunday as they bid to hold off Real Madrid and Barcelona in La Liga. Their city rivals Real play reigning title holders Bayern Munich in the Spanish capital Wednesday in the second semifinal of the Champions League.","Atletico Madrid and Chelsea play to scoreless draw in Champions League .

"(CNN) -- While many Western leaders have distanced themselves from the often controversial Winter Olympics, Chinese President Xi Jinping has been an enthusiastic guest in Sochi. In an exclusive interview with Rossiya, Russia's state news channel, a smiling Xi declared he was ""absolutely satisfied"" with the development of China-Russia ties. ""This period of Sino-Russian relations has the strongest foundation, the highest trust, and the greatest regional and global influence,"" said Xi, according to a transcript provided by Chinese state media. Xi has been eager to demonstrate his commitment to Russia, choosing it as the destination for his symbolic first foreign visit both last year, when he took office, and again this year. Xi's trip to Sochi is the first visit by a Chinese leader to an Olympics opening ceremony outside of Beijing. But according to Professor Jean-Pierre Cabestan, the chair of the Department of Government and International Studies at Hong Kong Baptist University, the relationship is not as rosy as it looks. ""I think China wants to keep a very close relationship with Russia, but there's a bit of asymmetry,"" he told CNN. ""Russia is also cultivating a better relationship with Japan -- they do not want to see China becoming too powerful."" Noting that Xi Jinping was seated far apart from Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe during the Games' opening ceremony, Cabestan said the placement was ""meaningful."" ""Putin wanted to keep some balance between China and Japan,"" he said. ""He sees Japan as a kind of balance against Chinese influence in the far East. That's Putin's policy, but he won't say it."" In the interview, Xi also opened up about the challenges of reforming his home country. ""After 30-plus years of reform, China has entered deep water,"" said Xi. ""You could say that the easy reforms - the ones that would make everyone happy - have been completed. The tasty meat has been eaten up, what's left are the tough bones that are hard to chew."" In the last two years, China has faced flagging growth, environmental issues, and social problems as migrant workers move en masse to the big cities. But Xi said the country would move forward with ""courage."" ""We should dare to wade into dangerous rapids,"" he said. At the end of the interview, the leader was asked if he had a favorite sport. The first one he named? Swimming.","Xi says he is ""absolutely satisfied"" with the development of China-Russia ties .

"(CNN) -- In 2009, when Meb Keflezighi won the New York City Marathon, The New York Times noted that he was attacked in the media and online for being ""not really an American runner."" Although the runner emigrated to the United States as a 12-year-old and has called America home ever since, Darren Rovell, then of CNBC, called the ""headline"" that an American had won the race ""empty,"" and compared Keflezighi to ""a ringer who you hire to work a couple hours at your office so that you can win the executive softball league."" (Rovell later apologized for his comments.) Now, winning the Boston Marathon a year after the bombing, a race longing for nationalist pride, Keflezighi's victory was greeted with onlookers erupting in chants of ""U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!"" It was a wonderful moment. In its coverage of this year's race, the Boston Globe website said: ""Keflezighi is first American to win men's race since 1983."" The story on Keflezighi doesn't even note that he was born in Eritrea. A year later, runners 'take back that finish line!' A year ago, the finish line of the Boston Marathon was blown up, allegedly by two brothers, Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev. A Boston Globe story on the Tsarnaev brothers, written a day after their identity was learned, notes in the first paragraph that both are ""from Cambridge"" but just two paragraphs later, highlights their foreignness -- ""ethnic Chechens, born in the former Soviet territory now known as Kyrgyzstan and transplanted to a working-class Inman Square neighborhood."" Keflezighi and the Tsarnaevs: Which of them is more American? Because it turns out that while the geography of our nation is fixed, our identity is treated as malleable -- and, especially for immigrants and people of color, revocable. What makes someone an American? It's a profoundly complicated and rich question for us, our identity having been forged out of many strands -- some willingly incorporated, others against their will, over generations and generations. But what seems to emerge from the Keflezighi/Tsarnaev example is the ephemeral nature of American identity. After all, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is a naturalized American citizen and his brother had a green card and reportedly hoped to naturalize. Keflezighi is also a naturalized citizen of the United States. On paper, at least, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Meb Keflezighi are the same as far as citizenship goes. But not in terms of fitting the popular conception of what is ""an American."" When the Tsarnaevs were identified, the Washington Post wrote: ""With their baseball hats and sauntering gaits, they appeared to friends and neighbors like ordinary American boys. But the Boston bombing suspects were refugees from another world -- the blood, rubble and dirty wars of the Russian Caucasus,"" hinting at the idea that the Tsarnaevs resembled dangerous wolflike immigrants in sheepish American clothing. In a similar vein, although immigration reform advocates call our nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants ""aspiring Americans,"" conservative opponents label these moms and dads and children ""criminals"" who ""broke the law."" Immigrants who grew up in the United States, who work day in and day out to contribute to our economy and our communities, are denied their essential American-ness. And worse. Called illegal ""aliens."" ""Cockroaches."" Not only not American, but rendered as animals. The message is clear. Although America the place was forged as a safe harbor for diverse peoples from difficult backgrounds, America the identity is often treated as a ranking, a way of separating the good from the bad, the deserving from the less-than. Who gets to be in which group often eerily tracks according to skin color. It's a practice that stands in direct violation of the values that make our nation great. When people commit heinous acts, we try to distance ourselves from them, physically and emotionally. If we believe those acts were carried out by people who are nothing like us, not people like our friends and neighbors but ""others,"" it's a psychological attempt at self-protection. That's human. But our culture teaches us to maintain our distance with nationalism, and especially racialized nationalism. In America, we make people we don't like the ""other,"" especially people who commit evil. But some groups of people are more readily dismissed than others. I'm not saying we should embrace the Tsarnaev brothers as examples of patriotic Americans. Of course not. But to deny their American-ness not only rejects our core values but perpetuates a dangerous blind spot about the realities of home-grown terrorism. According to a study by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, right-wing American terrorists -- most of whom were white Christian males -- perpetrated 145 ideologically motivated homicides between 1990 and 2010. During the same period, ""al Qaeda affiliates, al Qaeda-inspired extremists, and secular Arab nationalists"" committed 27 homicides in the United States, ""involving 16 perpetrators or groups of perpetrators."" Still, in the moments after news broke this month of yet another shooting at Fort Hood in Texas, before any details were known, conservative filmmaker and Breitbart.com contributor Pat Dollard tweeted, ""If there is even one more act of Muslim terrorism, it is then time for Americans to start slaughtering Muslims in the street, all of them."" The 2014 Fort Hood shooter was an American (and not of the Muslim faith) -- though news reports routinely noted he was from Puerto Rico. Imagine someone making a remark like Dollard's about conservative Christians or Christians in general. In the wake of the Oklahoma City bombings, Timothy McVeigh was called many things. But was his American identity stripped away? To the contrary, an autobiography about McVeigh is called ""The All-American Monster."" For people of color and immigrants in the United States, the grasp on American identity can be tenuous and temporary. Consider the black man whose citizenship and American-ness were routinely questioned even after he was elected president of the United States of America. Meb Keflezighi's victory in the Boston Marathon conjured up a sense of national belonging to which all parts of America should be entitled -- in our moments of victory, and our moments of defeat or worse. Rep. Paul Ryan once said, ""America is more than just a place. America is an idea."" Yes, and that idea -- that identity -- must never be allowed to flicker with discrimination or hate.","Sally Kohn: Boston Marathon winner was rightly described as ""an American""

"Asuncion, Paraguay (CNN) -- Paraguay's president, a former Roman Catholic bishop, has admitted he is the father of a 10-year-old boy, his attorney said. ""I have just had a meeting with the president. I have received instructions to begin today the paperwork for the recognition of the minor,"" Marcos Farina, the president's lawyer, told reporters. Narcisa de la Cruz, the boy's mother, said she met President Fernando Lugo when she came to him for spiritual guidance while he was bishop. ""Since I was having problems with my husband, I got close to him,"" she said. She is the fourth woman to claim having a child with the president. In 2009, Lugo admitted to fathering a son with one other woman, prompting an opposition senator to call on the Vatican to excommunicate him. Several days later, another woman came forward, claiming Lugo was her son's father. The paternity case for that boy is still pending. A judge dismissed another paternity case after DNA testing revealed Lugo was not the father. De la Cruz said that even though Lugo had not officially recognized the boy, she had been receiving money monthly from him. She said she made the paternity case before the media after she and her son were denied access to the president. ""Many times he went to (the president's official residence), and he was not allowed in. This made him feel very bad. 'Why,' he said, 'why are so many people entering with him, and I, his son, cannot enter?' "" she said. Many Paraguayan officials have declined to comment on Lugo's latest revelation, but some said that the president had done the right thing. ""What is important, above all, is that sooner or later, he assumed the responsibility of his paternity,"" Health Minister Esperanza Martinez said. Lugo was made a lay Catholic in 2008, about the time he assumed the presidency. The leftist leader is entering the final leg of his term, which ends in August 2013.

"(CNN) -- A 60-day state of emergency imposed on Bangkok and several surrounding areas has come to an end, giving the tourism industry hope that lagging arrival numbers in the Kingdom will improve. The state of emergency came into effect on January 22 in the run-up to the February 2 general election -- held amid widespread anti-government protests throughout the city -- and gave authorities the power to impose curfews, detain suspects without court permission, censor media and declare parts of the capital off limits. It has been replaced with the Internal Security Act (ISA), which will be in effect until April 30. This still gives authorities power to impose curfews, set up checkpoints and restrict the movement of demonstrators but is considered less severe. The Bangkok Post reports the ISA is needed to maintain law and order during the Senate election on March 30 and reruns of the general election, expected in April. The caretaker government, led by Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, said the decision to lift the state of emergency a few days early was designed to reverse the negative impact Thailand's political crisis has had on the country's tourism industry and overall economy. ""The use of the Internal Security Act will help project a positive image of Thailand, particularly in terms of business, investment, and tourism,"" said the government in a media briefing on the situation. Tourism industry expected to recover quickly . More than 20 people have been killed and hundreds wounded since protests erupted in Bangkok in November, hitting the tourism industry hard as the news made global headlines. The November to February period is Thailand's tourist high season -- record numbers of visitor arrivals were anticipated. Since the protests started, tourist arrival expectations for 2014 have been revised downward 3% from 28.1 million (a prediction made in July 2013) to 27.5 million, according to a report by the state-run National News Bureau of Thailand. Ending the emergency decree will help the tourism industry recover within a few months, it added. In February, demonstrations were scaled back and various protest sites throughout the city closed. Anti-government protesters, still intent on ousting Yingluck, now congregate at central Bangkok's Lumpini Park. ""Provided the protests remain subdued then we believe tourism in Bangkok (it was relatively unaffected in the rest of the country and in the beach resorts) will gradually pick up,"" Andrew Yates, head of equities at Asia Plus Securities, told CNN. The lifting of the emergency degree should also have a positive impact on the conference and incentive travel business, which brings a lot of high end travelers to Thailand, he said. ""These trips are generally discretionary travel or can be relocated quite easily,"" said Yates. ""They are extremely sensitive to political disturbances or health issues like SARS and avian flu."" Insurance is another major issue for many tour groups, as travel insurance tends to be invalidated by civil disturbances and a state of emergency would meet the definition of most policies, he said. ""Even though a tourist's chances of being killed or injured in a protest are slight, it happened to several in 1991, and most tour operators won't take any chances. There is also the risk of being stuck, if airports are shut down."" Travel advisories now a key issue . ""The removal of the state of emergency decree is clearly encouraging for Thai Tourism stakeholders,"" Martin Craigs, CEO of the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA), told CNN. ""However the key issue is how this will effect travel advisories."" Yates had a similar take. ""Thailand would want to see either a lifting or easing of the travel warnings issued by various embassies, this should help [win] back the mass market tourists, especially from China who are more concerned with safety than a cheap room,"" he said. ""These warnings were in relation to the street protests, not the SOE itself."" More than 40 countries issued warnings to their citizens relating to Bangkok since protests began in November. In January, Hong Kong gave the Thai capital a ""black"" designation -- a dubious honor shared only with Egypt, the Philippines and Syria. Martin says PATA research showed air travel bookings from Hong Kong to Thailand went down in January over 50%. On Wednesday, Hong Kong updated its warning. ""In view of the latest situation in Bangkok, and the fact that the state of emergency in Bangkok and the surrounding provinces was lifted by the Thai Government, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government today (March 19) adjusted the Outbound Travel Alert (OTA) for Thailand (Bangkok) to amber -- the same as for other parts of Thailand,"" said a government spokesman. Thailand's Tourism Authority is reportedly now planning a large marketing campaign to promote the country globally. The main theme will be ""Thailand: Best Friend Forever (BFF)."" ""While the state of emergency has caused little inconvenience to travelers to Thailand, its lifting is a sign that things are fast returning to normal in Bangkok,"" said Thawatchai Arunyik, governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand.","Thailand lifts state of emergency on Bangkok and surrounding areas .

"CANNES, France (CNN) -- Dark glasses are de rigueur on the sun-kissed French Riviera, but this year glamorous cineastes attending the opening night of Cannes were matching another kind of face wear with their tuxedoes and designer dresses. The crew of ""Up"" pose for photographers ahead of the animated movie's premiere at Cannes. The audience donned 3D glasses as they attended the premiere of Pixar's ""Up,"" an animation in 3D, which marked the start of world's most prestigious film festival. It is the first time in the festival's 62-year history that Cannes has opened with an animation. ""Up"" will show out of competition. John Lasseter, chief creative officer of acclaimed filmmaker-led animation studio Pixar described the moment as ""one of the greatest things that has happened to us in our careers."" He said: ""To have your movie actually open it is really, really exciting -- and to be the first 3D film too."" The festival's surprise choice, in the wake of the recent success of 3D pictures ""Coraline"" and DreamWorks' ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" earlier this year, is perhaps the boldest message yet that 3D is being embraced by the mainstream as the format of the future. According to Lasseter, who is also chief creative officer at Walt Disney Animation Studios, Pixar's tenth film also marks a major shift for both studios. ""All of our films from now on will be made in 3D both at Pixar and at the Disney Animation Studios as well,"" he said. ""Up,"" co-directed by Pete Docter and Bob Petersen, tells the story of a grouchy 78-year-old widower who ties thousands of helium balloons to his ramshackle house and floats away to realize his dream of visiting South America. The heart-warming tale, which took four years to complete, is visually stunning, using 3D to make the screen like a window into the world of the film. ""We really tried to use depth in the same we use color and cinematography, and that is to further the emotion of the scene,"" said Docter of the philosophy behind the team's use of 3D in ""Up."" The computer animated drama showcases the strength of the format to immerse viewers in the narrative -- especially when it is in the hands of talented storytellers. Docter and Petersen steer clear of using 3D to create wow factor with the visual gags the format can provide. Lasseter agrees that 3D should be used as an aid to storytelling and not just for cheap visual thrills. ""3D has a tendency, especially when you do all that 'comin'-at-you' stuff, everybody laughs, but now they're out of the story, so we try to restrict that."" Lasseter who co-founded the legendary animation studio behind animations ""Toy Story' (1995), and ""Monsters Inc."" (2001), is one of many high profile 3D advocates. DreamWorks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg has said that 3D is a film revolution akin to the inception of sound, which ushered in the era of the ""talkies"" in the early 20th Century. Pixar made its first 3D film, ""Knick Knack"" in 1989. ""The problem was that there was no theater in the world that you could see it in,"" said ""Up"" producer, Jonas Rivera. ""We were waiting 16 or 17 years to see it in 3D."" The problem of 3D screens has been solved by digital cinema, and although the roll out of 3D-enabled cinemas has been dealt a blow by the economic downturn, exhibitors are continuing to install screens all over the world. Hollywood is also squarely behind 3D, green-lighting features from directors like Tim Burton and George Lucas. The studios hope it will be the format global audiences will be watching films in the future -- in the cinemas and not in their living rooms. In April, DreamWorks Animation's latest feature, ""Monsters vs. Aliens,"" opened on 2,000 3D screens in the U.S and there are high hopes that James Cameron's 3D title ""Avatar"" will be a 2010 Christmas blockbuster. This year at Cannes, there are even some 3D films screening in the market including, ""Station 21,"" a sci-fi thriller from French director, Olivier Parthonnaud. Pixar's innovation in filmmaking will be honored later this year at the Venice Film Festival, when the studio will be presented with a Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement -- the first time in the festival's history that a studio has been awarded this prize.","Pixar's ""Up"" is first animation to open world's most prestigious film festival .

"(CNN) -- Police in Kansas City are telling motorists to remain vigilant in the wake of 13 shooting incidents in the past month on major highways and roads around the Missouri city. Some drivers are nervous, CNN affiliate KCTV reported. ""A little uneasy. It's unaimed, not targeted. You don't know who they are shooting at. It could be anybody,"" Ashley Quinn told the station. Some drivers said they were taking secondary roads, especially after nightfall. No shootings have been reported since Sunday, police said in a news release. But three people have been shot since March 8. None of the victims suffered life-threatening injuries. Most of the cars have been shot in the driver's or front passenger's doors. There have been 10 reported shootings in Kansas City and one each in Blue Springs, Leawood and Lee's Summit. Police are also looking into other claims to see if they should be added to the total. Some of those reports were for incidents before March 8, police said . Police are not giving many details on what witnesses have reported, but said at least several of the shootings were linked.

"(CNN) -- A brush fire near Disney World prompted authorities to bar traffic in both directions along a major central Florida highway for several hours at the beginning of the busy Memorial Day weekend, a police spokeswoman said. Large plumes of white and gray smoke hovered over and around Interstate 4 for much of Friday afternoon, footage from CNN affiliate WKMG showed. Flames about 6 feet high could be seen rising from one section off the highway, just off an exit ramp to Epcot/Downtown Disney and South International Drive. Firefighters aboard what looked like a red pickup drove up to it and shot water to subdue that part of the fire. Other overhead footage showed a tractor-like vehicle roving through lightly forested areas off a highway, where small patches of fire were evident. A small section of grass could be seen burning along one stretch of road, mere feet from where cars were buzzing by. By 3 p.m., eastbound lanes of that interstate highway had been shut down around Osceola Parkway because of the fire, according to Kim Montes, a spokeswoman for the Florida Highway Patrol. Soon afterward, state troopers shut westbound lanes of the same highway, shuttling that traffic onto U.S. 528. But the situation improved considerably over the course of the afternoon, with increasingly fewer flames and less smoke visible. By 5:30 p.m., Interstate 4 had reopened in both directions, according to Montes. ""All you have to do is look in your own yard to see how dry it is right now. It takes nothing for a small fire to become a big fire,"" Orange County Fire Rescue Battalion Chief David Sullivan told reporters. ""Luckily no one has been hurt, no one has been displaced, nothing has been damaged,"" he added. Joseph Sikon, a 21-year-old who attends medical school in Orlando, said he noticed the blaze after getting out of a movie theater Friday afternoon in Downtown Disney, part of the Walt Disney World Resort. ""It was this large cloud of pluming smoke,"" said Sikon, a CNN iReporter. ""Obviously, it was a very large fire."" David Charlton, a Shelbyville, Kentucky, resident staying at the Gaylord Palms Resort and Convention Center in Kissimmee, said he noticed smoke about 1:30 p.m. Within 15 minutes, the situation had deteriorated significantly. ""It was pretty smoky and irritating to breathe,"" said Charlton, who submitted photographs to CNN iReport from outside the hotel that showed Orange County fire vehicles directly across the street. He said activities at the resort were initially called off because of the fire. But later in the afternoon, there was an announcement that the fire was under control. Charlton's iReport photo .

"Eastern Cape, South Africa (CNN) -- The journey from boyhood to manhood is a poignant time in any community. This goes double for the Xhosa men that live in South Africa's Eastern Cape. Males between the ages of 18 and 20 undergo an initiation, whereby the don traditional robes and paint their faces in clay before they are circumcised by traditional healers. ""We have to go through an initiation process, where we have to go to the initiation school for about a month, and learn about manhood protocol and learn about our culture as well,"" explains Laduma Ngxokolo, a leading knitwear designer, and himself a Xhosa man from the Eastern Cape. But for six months after initiation, as a symbol of their journey, Xhosa men swap their traditional clothing for formal wear -- typically tweed jackets, khaki trousers and checked caps -- all distinctly Western in their origins. ""For me, that's awkward because we are practicing a traditional culture and yet wearing clothes which are Western,"" Ngxokolo says. Spotting an opportunity, Ngxokolo decided to create menswear that incorporated more local designs and materials through his label MaXhosa. ""I decided to come up with something that would speak a language of the Xhosa, and actually use some of the aesthetics which is well known among Xhosa."" He uses patterns inspired by Xhosa bead work, and uses wool and mohair available in the Eastern Cape. It's a look that has resonated, not just at home, but in the global fashion community as well. Last year, he exhibited at Labo Ethnik Fashion Week in Paris. But even as his popularity grows overseas, he remains proudly South African. ""There are a lot of products coming into the country that don't support the economy and which don't resemble any of the heritage and culture around us,"" he explains. ""I would prefer to celebrate what I have here before going abroad and celebrating things that are out there.""","In South Africa, Xhosa boys undergo an initiation when entering manhood .

"(CNN) -- The writing was on the wall for Liverpool. Some 25 years after the stadium disaster that cost the lives of 96 supporters, the club is marching towards its first English title since the season immediately following that tragedy at Hillsborough. The team's players could understandably be nervous about the prospect of ending such a long wait for Liverpool's next championship -- its 19th overall and first since the advent of the Premier League. But, after title rival Chelsea stumbled on Saturday, Brendan Rodgers' side showed no such anxiety in dispatching struggling Norwich 3-2 to move five points clear at the top of the table. And the manager said his charges had drawn inspiration from the speech by the leader of the Hillsborough Support Group, Margaret Aspinall, who spoke at Tuesday's memorial service for the victims and survivors of the 1989 stadium crush. ""I used some words of Margaret Aspinall -- we put them up on the wall,"" the Northern Irishman told Liverpool's website after Sunday's away win, the team's 11th in a row. ""She talked about stress and how it can prove difficult for you, but it can also offer you great determination to fight. ""Those were the words that we gave the players before the game today. This is a club that is one club at this moment in time, and we're all fighting to achieve the ultimate goal."" The victory sets the scene for next Sunday's visit by Chelsea to Anfield, and puts more pressure on third-placed Manchester City to win against another team battling to avoid relegation -- West Brom -- on Monday. Liverpool and Chelsea have three games left, while 2012 champion City has five -- but is nine points off the lead. ""In the changing room before they go out, we just remind them to go and lose themselves, just focus on the ball and focus on the team,"" said Rodgers, whose team is now guaranteed a place in the European Champions League for the first time since 2010. ""If you can do that, then we can be a real force. You saw all the characteristics of our team -- wonderful invention, creativity, arrogance on the ball, young players and senior players all playing in a structure that allows them to express themselves. ""And they had to show the courage to dig in and fight, away from home against a team that's fighting for their life to stay in the division. It's going to be a brilliant game next weekend. The supporters will be right up for it, as will the team."" Liverpool took a 2-0 lead inside 11 minutes through young winger Raheem Sterling, with a long-range effort, and top scorer Luis Suarez -- who became the first player to net 30 times in the league for the club since Ian Rush in 1987. The Uruguay striker is now just one short of the Premier League record for a 38-game season, held by Alan Shearer and Cristiano Ronaldo. Norwich, just two points above the relegation zone, hit back through striker Gary Hooper following the halftime break but England World Cup hopeful Sterling restored Liverpool's advantage just after an hour before Robert Snodgrass' header set up a tense finish. ""He is the best young player in European football at the moment,"" Rodgers said of Sterling, who set up Suarez's 12th goal in five games against Norwich. ""At 19 years of age you don't see anyone better. His intelligence with the ball, his movement and he's scoring goals. His first goal was a wonderful strike. He's just shifted it, got his shot off; to beat a goalkeeper of John Ruddy's quality shows you the quality of the strike. ""His pass for Luis' goal was like a top midfield player, so there's an assist, and his position for the counter attack when he broke away and obviously gets a bit of luck on the deflection -- but his overall performance, he's shown so much maturity."" Arsenal's chances of qualifying for the Champions League for the 15th successive season remain in the London club's own hands after Sunday's 3-0 win at 14th-placed Hull. Germany forward Lukas Podolski followed up his midweek double in the 3-1 victory at home to West Ham by scoring twice more following Aaron Ramsey's opener -- the Wales midfielder's ninth in the league this season and first since this month's return from long-term injury. Everton closed to within a point of fourth-placed Arsenal by beating Manchester United 2-0 in Sunday's later game -- billed as a clash between managers Roberto Martinez and David Moyes. It was a bitter blow for former Everton boss Moyes, who has had a miserable first season with defending champion United -- and now knows that next season the club will not be playing in the Champions League. A penalty from Leighton Baines and another goal from striker Kevin Mirallas before halftime left United 13 points behind Arsenal.","Liverpool five points clear in English Premier League after beating Norwich 3-2 on Sunday .

"Washington (CNN) -- House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa demanded Wednesday that the Federal Election Commission turn over records of more than five years of communications with the Internal Revenue Service -- a move that significantly expands the California Republican's ongoing probe of alleged federal targeting of conservative groups. In a letter to FEC Chairman Ellen Weintraub -- a Democrat -- Issa cited CNN reporting on Monday that raises ""the prospect of inappropriate coordination between the IRS and the FEC about tax-exempt entities."" Among other things, Issa asked for records of all communications between the IRS and the FEC dating back to the start of 2008. He also requested records of any FEC discussions relating to tax-exempt applications or organizations since 2008. The letter was co-signed by Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan, a prominent member of Issa's panel. FEC vice-chair says email raises questions of improper contact with IRS . Iss'a letter came after Don McGahn, the vice chairman of the FEC and a Republican, told CNN that he saw an e-mail from an FEC investigator to Lois Lerner, the former head of the IRS division responsible for reviewing applications from various groups for tax-exempt status. The investigator asked Lerner, herself a former FEC employee, to discuss the status of the American Future Fund, a conservative political advocacy group. McGahn noted that after Lerner was contacted, the IRS sent a questionnaire to the American Future Fund. Lerner, the figure at the center of the congressional investigation into alleged IRS targeting of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status, invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when called to testify before Issa's panel in May. ""Dealing with Lois Lerner is probably out of the ordinary,"" McGahn said, stressing that FEC commissioners had not given their staffers permission to reach out to the IRS on the matter, a step typically required for such inquiries. Last week, GOP congressional investigators disclosed several e-mails between Lerner and an FEC attorney inquiring about the status of both the American Future Fund and another conservative outfit, the American Issues Project. IRS, Issa escalate fight over investigation . Issa's letter identifies the FEC attorney as William Powers, an official in the commission's Office of the General Counsel. The e-mails between Powers and Lerner were initially uncovered by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp, R-Michigan, who sent a letter last week to acting IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel requesting additional details about the controversial contact. While the prospect of potential FEC involvement with the IRS raises the prospect of a broader federal targeting effort, Democrats continue to insist there is no conspiracy, and stress that the publicly released contact between the two agencies was nothing more than requests for information already in the public domain. McGahn told CNN, however, that additional e-mails he has seen do not clearly state whether the FEC was only seeking public data. Requesting private data would likely violate federal law. For her part, Weintraub told CNN Monday she does not know about the e-mails between the FEC investigator and Lerner to which McGahn is referring. ""If there was any evidence or targeting based on ideology, that would be extremely serious, but I have not seen any evidence of that,"" she said. ""I am not aware of requesting or receiving any confidential taxpayer information. I am not aware of any requests for anything that wasn't publicly available."" Issa wants the FEC to turn over the records no later than August 21.

"(CNN) -- Russia hit back at Prince Charles after reports emerged that the heir to the British throne compared Russian President Vladimir Putin to Adolf Hitler. According to the Daily Mail newspaper, a woman claims Charles made the offhand comment during a tour Monday of the Canadian Museum of Immigration in Halifax, Nova Scotia. ""I would like to say that if these words were truly spoken, then without a doubt, they do not reflect well on the future British monarch,"" Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich said Thursday. The spokesman accused the royal family in general of using the media to smear Russia's involvement in the Ukraine crisis. ""That's why we view the use of the Western press by members of the British royal family to spread the propaganda campaign against Russia on a pressing issue -- that is, the situation in Ukraine -- as unacceptable, outrageous and low,"" he said. Charles was talking with a 78-year Polish woman who escaped the Nazi Holocaust by sailing to Canada in 1939 -- just before Germany seized the city of Gdansk, the Daily Mail said. ""I had finished showing him the exhibit and talked with him about my own family background and how I came to Canada,"" the newspaper quoted Marienne Ferguson as saying. ""The prince then said, 'And now Putin is doing just about the same as Hitler,' "" the newspaper quoted her as saying, referring to Russia's disputed annexation of Crimea. Ferguson said she agreed with Charles. CNN could not independently confirm the conversation. Representatives for Charles declined to comment. Also, Russia's deputy ambassador to the United Kingdom is meeting a senior UK Foreign Office official Thursday in London amid the controversy over the reported comments.

"(CNN) -- With only a 45 minute flight separating Lagos and Accra, you'd think I'd have been to Ghana at least once in my 22-year existence. Unfortunately until July 2013, the concepts holiday and Africa have never gone together in my head. Holiday was Italy and structurally unsound towers; or America and discount shopping or France and baguettes. Not Ghana, longstanding ""frenemy ""of Nigeria, with the football team we all rooted for in the last World Cup. Yet, that's no reason to actually visit the place. I went for a family wedding. If not for love, perhaps another 22 years would have passed before I made it to Accra. The first thing that struck me almost as soon as I stepped off the plane was the manner of the people. Now I know it is hackneyed and passÃ© and terribly clichÃ©d to praise the hospitality of the locals and so I make the next statement knowing that I tread on imperial ground: Ghanaians are nice. The friendly coconut seller in the photo above is just one of the myriad of fresh produce vendors that are dotted around the city. You spy a coconut, you pick a coconut, he splits the coconut and you drink the water out of it, right there and then on the roadside. No preservatives, no plastic bottles, just coconut. Read this: 7 amazing mountain climbs in Africa . I've often wondered why the global indexes drawn up only rank things like ""Ease of Doing Business"" or ""Democracy,"" with criteria that leave African countries nearer the bottom than top. If only someone would draw up a ranking for Fresh Produce Consumption. This love of fresh food was on one occasion, however, taken to a rather bizarre extreme. My hotel restaurant didn't have half the dinner menu because the necessary ingredients were always bought fresh from the market and the market was closed! Speaking of hotels, due to exceptionally bad planning, I found myself staying in three hotels over eight nights. The last, The University of Legon Guesthouse, was the best value for money. For $60 a night, I got an air-conditioned ensuite double room, beautifully landscaped grounds, the fastest internet I have used in West Africa and reasonably priced meals in the restaurant. Read this: Ghana, the jewel of West Africa . Now, as an original Lagosian, I haven't been to a place unless I've gone shopping in a place. I hit Oxford Street, Osu, on my second day in town. It's a roadside market that caters to the cravings of an ankara lover like myself, or 'African print' to those not quite in the know. However, for more upmarket shoppers who want their air-conditioning and shopping trolleys, there's the Accra City Mall in East Legon where Ghanaian designers sell their work alongside international brands. In my humble opinion, local content was winning but I'm a little biased. There are of course conventional touristy things to do in Accra. For the reasonable sum of six cedis, you can enjoy The Kwame Nkrumah Memorial Park, final resting place of the first President of Ghana. It's a serene venue for contemplation. The museum on site sheds some light on the man behind the leader that was a pivotal part of the independence movement in Africa. Yet I also like to see the places not fashionable enough for the beaten track, places that probably wouldn't make it into a glossy tourist brochure. Ghana, beautiful as it is, is still a developing country. There are shopping malls and skyscrapers -- one born every minute -- but there is also Nima, where I met a lady who chops firewood every evening to cook her meals. Read this: Artists take epic Africa road trip . I had open access to Nima thanks to the organization Invisible Borders and their partnerships in the area. Perhaps not all the Millennium Development Goals have been met in Nima but there were other signs of development that international agencies don't often look for. I had my first private art viewing in Musa's studio in Nima. Only a stone's throw away from that was a photography exhibition in Nima Roundabout. It wasn't all sightseeing and games though. I also went to Accra for the very serious business of book promoting. I've never been on radio in West Africa. It's no different from being on radio in England except the presenters on Joy and Citi FM understood my accent. I left Accra determined to go on holiday in more African countries.

"(CNN) -- ""Our Nixon"" is mostly comprised of Super 8 home movies made by three of President Nixon's closest aides: H.R. ""Bob"" Haldeman, John Ehrlichman, and Dwight Chapin. A lot of people have asked us how we got our hands on their home movies, and whether we had to license them. The short answer is that we got the films from the Nixon Library (which is part of the National Archives and Records Administration), and we didn't have to license them because they are in the public domain. But how they ended up in the Nixon Library, why they are in the public domain, and what happened when we found out there were multiple copies of the whole collection (of widely varying quality!) is an interesting story. Haldeman, Ehrlichman and Chapin were enthusiastic amateur cinematographers. Between 1969 and 1973, they filmed more than 500 reels of Super 8. And the United States Navy Photographic Center fueled their enthusiasm by providing them with free film and processing, as well as copies of their films to share with each other. Dwight Chapin also told us that they had planned to donate copies to the official presidential records. Four lessons from Nixon's failed presidency . But the home movies took an unexpected path during the Watergate investigation, when the FBI confiscated the contents of Ehrlichman's office, including a box of a duplicate set (copies) of the home movies. Thus, the home movies were among the evidence given to the Watergate special prosecutor. (We are speculating, but we're going to go out a limb here and say they were not of any use at all in that investigation.) When Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, he arranged to have his presidential papers sent to his home in San Clemente, California, assuming that they were his personal property. His assumption was warranted, as all his predecessors had taken possession of their papers after their terms of office. Attorney General William Saxbe agreed that the papers belonged to Nixon, but also concluded that the government had to respond to subpoenas covering the papers. Accordingly, Nixon agreed to deposit his papers with the administrator of General Services, with the understanding that some of the papers would eventually be donated to the United States. Under the agreement, Nixon retained title to his papers and could prohibit their use. The inner demons that drove Nixon . Congress was concerned that Nixon would destroy papers relevant to the Watergate investigation, so it passed the Presidential Records and Materials Preservation Act of 1974 (""PRMPA""), 44 U.S.C. Â§ 2111 (1988). The PRMPA authorized the administrator of General Services to take possession of and provide access to Nixon's presidential papers, including the secret White House tapes. Regulations issued under the PRMPA allowed interested parties to object to the release of particular documents, and authorized the administrator to return purely personal materials to Nixon. Nixon immediately challenged the constitutionality of the PRMPA. While the Supreme Court ultimately upheld the PRMPA, it did not determine whether Nixon was entitled to compensation for his papers. Nixon v. Adm'r of Gen. Services, 433 U.S. 425 (1977). In 1980, Nixon filed an action for just compensation under the Takings Clause, which he eventually won, after more than a decade of litigation.Nixon v. U.S., 978 F.2d 1269 (1992). In 2000, the Justice Department agreed to pay the Nixon estate $18 million. In response to the litigation over Nixon's presidential papers, Congress passed the Presidential Records Act of 1978 (""PRA""), 44 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2201-07, which took effect on January 20, 1980. The PRA provides that Presidential and Vice-Presidential records are the property of the United States, and establishes procedures for their preservation, including eventual public access. As a result of the PRMPA, Nixon's presidential papers became the property of the United States and were deposited in the National Archives. The Nixon collection included 44 million documents, 3,700 hours of audiotapes, thousands of photographs, and -- getting back around to where we come into this -- the box of Super 8 films that came from Ehrlichman's office! Under the PRMPA regulations, purely personal material was removed from the home movies and returned to Haldeman, Ehrlichman and Chapin. Everything that remained was optically printed to 16mm color negative film for preservation. Serendipitously, we happened to know the guy (Bill Brand) who had been contracted to make these preservation prints. So, that's how we heard about the home movies. Just hearing about them from Bill was enough to make us think there was a very special film in there, just waiting for someone to make it. We paid for the National Archives to make standard definition video transfers of the preservation negative, and we began editing ""Our Nixon"" with these. They were pretty low resolution, being copies of copies, but we decided we could live with the quality since the content was so astonishing. But about a year into our edit, we learned that the Haldeman family had donated another set of copies of the Super 8 films. Consulting with Nixon Library archivist Ryan Pettigrew, we discovered that this collection contained originals rather than copies. The difference in image quality, detail and resolution was stunning! We had actually already locked picture with the lower-quality telecines, but we gulped hard and decided it was worth it, both in terms of money spent and additional work in post-production, to make a whole new set of scans so that ""Our Nixon"" would look as good as it could possibly be. Since at the time the Nixon Library did not have a budget allocated to apply their standard 16mm inter-negative preservation technique to this collection, and since we desperately wanted to use it in our film, we proposed to pay for archival-quality digital scans. We hired Jeff Kreines, inventor of the Kinetta film scanner, to travel to the Nixon Library and make the scans. He scanned every frame of the entire collection at a resolution much higher than HD video, and delivered them to us as digital files. This suited both our needs as filmmakers and the Nixon Library's interest in experimenting with an affordable method of digital film preservation. Of course, it also meant we had to manually replace every frame of our film with the new scans -- a saga unto itself -- but it was worth it!","Three of Nixon's aides documented their experiences with home movie cameras .

"(CNN) -- It's a hold-your-breath kind of place. Machu Picchu, one of the world's greatest treasures, this weekend marks the 100th anniversary of its rediscovery by explorer Hiram Bingham. This majestic and mysterious ancient Inca settlement sits in splendid repose high on an Andean mountaintop. The well-preserved site is the leading tourist attraction in Peru, the third-largest country in South America. If you are planning to experience its magic, here are some things you'll need to know: . Getting within range . Most visitors fly to Lima, Peru's capital, then fly southeast to Cusco, located in a deep Andes valley. You'll need to spend a few days there to get acclimated to the higher elevation, nearly 11,000 feet above sea level. Cusco was once the capital of the Inca world, but today it's a city that comfortably caters to the hordes of visitors who stop over. After catching your breath, it's time to travel to Machu Picchu. Most tourists take the train and there are different classes of service, from inexpensive to luxury. If you're taking the train, make your reservations early, particularly in the high season from May to September. Hardy folks will hike the Inca Trail, which can take three or four grueling days to complete and is no walk in the park. The number of people allowed on the trail each day is limited, so you'll need to book with an Inca Trail outfitter months in advance and arrange for permits. Reaching the mountain . Trains take explorers to Aguas Calientes, a neat and tidy town at the base of the mountain where Machu Picchu rests. You buy two important tickets in the town center: bus tickets to Machu Picchu and entrance tickets for the ruins themselves (you can't buy tickets to the ruins at the entrance). Purchase Machu Picchu tickets at the Machu Picchu Cultural Center in Aguas Calientes. It's best to bring cash for the tickets, although there is an ATM in town. You can also buy advance tickets to Machu Picchu in Cusco at the Institute of National Culture. Tickets cost about $44. Buy tickets for the bus before you get on at the ticket office near the departure point. The ticket office opens and the first buses head to Machu Picchu around 5 a.m. The bus ride up the mountain takes 20 minutes but seems like forever, negotiating the stomach-churning switchback road to the top. Seeing Machu Picchu . It is also called the Citadel, imperious and fortresslike on the mountain summit. Machu Picchu means ""Old Mountain"" in Quechua, the language of the Incas. This old mountain is often covered in clouds, and the sheer drop at the edges of the ruins can be unsettling. There are two very distinct sections. The agricultural area leads to the impressive urban sector, where the religious, astronomical and residential structures still stand. The entire site is about two square miles. The Incas worshipped what they knew and built an impressive Temple of the Sun high above the residential zone. The days of the solstice were deeply special and spiritual to them. But there are also impressive places where the residents lived and worked, even spent time in prison for offenses committed. What's the mystery? The Citadel is not only enshrouded in mist but also in mystery. No one knows precisely its genesis, intended purpose, how many lived there or why they left. It appears to date from the period of the two great Incas, Pachacutec Inca Yupanqui (1438-71) and Tupac Inca Yupanqui (1472-93), according to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Bingham found Machu Picchu -- purely by accident -- on July 24, 1911, while heading a Yale University expedition to Peru. He was camping along the river near Aguas Calientes when he met a local campesino, or farmer, named Melchor Arteaga. He led Bingham up from the river to what were then jungle-covered ruins atop the Old Mountain. And the rest, as they say, is history. Bingham was actually looking for the famed ruins of Vilcabamba, some 60 miles away, known as the last stronghold of the Incas. The Incas were chased relentlessly by Spanish conquistadors, who began subjugating Peru in 1533. The Spanish probably never knew about Machu Picchu, either, because they pursued the Incas in the opposite direction. The best way to experience the Citadel . Machu Picchu is too important to rush. Most tourists spend part of just one day at the site. They arrive in Aguas Calientes in midmorning by train, visit the Citadel for a few hours, then catch the late afternoon trains back to Cuzco. I think it's worth staying over in the town known for its hot springs and cold-running rivers. Aguas Calientes offers plenty of shops, restaurants and hotels. Begin your visit early in the day and stay late, when crowds thin and you'll feel you have Machu Picchu all to yourself. The ruins are open from dawn to dusk every day. A stay of two days is optimal. On the first you can see every nook and cranny of the ancient settlement. Then on the second day, you can attempt to climb the mountains adjoining Machu Picchu. One is Huayna Picchu, which means ""Young Mountain."" Healthy hikers can make the trip in about an hour, but the path is very steep. If you can't make that trek, there are two smaller peaks: Huchu Picchu, which is the smallest, and Wychu Picchu. Machu Picchu is unquestionably a popular place. In fact, many scientists worry that the relentless crush of crowds is harming the ruins and could cause the Citadel to fall down the side of the mountain as soils shift . But for now the crowds still come. Every day is unique and mystical at Machu Picchu. Take your time and see it in all its glory.

"(CNN) -- Up until very recently, conventional wisdom held that shipping was a minor player in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. That all changed in October last year. Leaked details of a report by the International Association of Independent Tanker Owners (Intertanko) got into the press, and revealed an uncomfortable truth about the shipping industry -- its emissions could be double the amount everyone previously believed. Ships emit twice as much greenhouse gases as planes, according to at least one report. And that would make it's carbon footprint double that of the aviation industry. The aviation industry emits around 650 million tons of greenhouse gases every year, representing around 3 percent of the global total. If the leaked documents from research submitted for the Interanko report are to be believed, the shipping industry's contribution is more than twice the amount previously believed (600 million tons) -- which would mean ships emit as much as 1.2 billion tons of greenhouse gases a year. That would mean ships contribute between 5 percent and 6 percent of all the world's greenhouse gases. To put that in perspective, according to law firm Earth Justice there are only six countries in the world with greater carbon dioxide emissions than the shipping industry: the United States, Japan, Germany, Russia, India and China. Quick facts about the shipping industry: . • Ships consume at least 2 billion barrels of oil a year;  • They emit 20 percent of all sulphur dioxide emissions; • 30 percent of all nitrogen oxide emissions;  • As much as 1.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide;  • Ships are responsible for at least 60,000 pollution-related deaths a year . In addition to contributing to global warming, the airborne particles ships release from burning fuel (which is less refined than plane fuel) have been responsible for a high number of land-based premature deaths. A report by the University of Delaware believes at least 60,000 people die each year from lung or heart failure, caused by airborne particles small enough to enter the blood. They believe that number will increase by 40 percent by 2012. The people who may be getting it worse are those who live near the world's ports. A recent study by Bluewater Network suggests that a single cruise liner stopping off at a port can emit as much greenhouse gas as 12,400 cars during its stay there. (It is suggesting a system whereby docking ships can ""plug in"" to the local electricity grid which, they say, would slash smokestack emissions by nearly 100 percent.) Global trade pushes shipping . The reason the shipping industry's carbon footprint is so large is essentially because of global trade. At least 90 percent of all global trade is served by the shipping industry. Why? Because ships can carry a whole lot more stuff than planes, making them a much more cost-effective means of transporting goods. As a result, while the aviation industry transports around 40 million tons of freight a year, the shipping industry carries 6 billion tons of it. Ships carry products over a collective distance of 6 million kilometers (3.7 million miles) every year. It's not so surprising then why they get through so much fuel. In 2001 alone, they gobbled up as much as 280 millions tons of it. That's more than twice as much fuel as the entire aviation industry gets through (130 million tons) a year -- and twice as much as Germany uses up. Some believe a virtuous circle has been created by advances in shipping technology and the explosion in international trade. The opening statement of a 2005 report issued by the OECD's Maritime Transport Committee is quite revealing in this regard: . ""The study confirms what was already known. The adaptability of regular cargo shipping lines and advances in technology -- mainly containerization -- have accompanied or even encouraged the vigorous growth in the trade of manufactured goods and the transfer of their production to regions and countries offering significant comparative advantages, mainly in terms of labor costs."" In short, as more goods get made in poorer countries, there will be more need to transport them to their customer markets around the world. The increase in the global transfer of goods will therefore dictate the levels of ships' fuel consumption, and therefore their negative impact on the environment as well. By 2020 some estimates put the amount of fuel ships will need at as high as 400 million tons -- just to sustain the increase in business they receive from the growth in global trade. If nothing is done to come up with cleaner ways to power ships, maritime emissions could balloon by as much as 75 percent within that same time period, some estimates go. So how come ships have fallen below the radar for so long? Some believe the reason has a lot to do with an imbalance of public pressure, which has traditionally focused on cars and planes. The thinking goes, most people know who the airlines and car makers are, while they would be hard-pressed to name the world's largest ocean shipping company (it's Denmark's Maersk). Others, like WWF say it has been difficult to regulate the shipping industry  because ""international law limits the ability of coastal nations to impose and enforce their own environmental and navigational regulations on foreign ships passing through their waters"". For this reason, it says, countries have traditionally followed conventions set by international organizations such as the International Maritime Organization. But WWF argues the beaurocratic processes involved in these types of international bodies can mean issues take an unnecessarily long time to resolve (neither aviation nor shipping is included in the Kyoto Protocol, for example, and discussions to include these two polluting industries in the follow-up agreement to Kyoto are only happening now). Essentially, the only countries that tend to push issues are the ones that are directly impacted. And that means even if issues are recognized early on, until enough interested countries push the agenda, those attempting to bring these issues to global attention remain lone voices. As the WWF points out on its web site: ""It was only after the single-hulled Exxon Valdez went down off the coast of Alaska in 1989 that the U.S. introduced a phase-out of these old tankers...It took the sinking of the single-hulled Erika ten years later off the coast of France for the member states of the IMO to accelerate the global phase-out to match that of the US."" However law firm, Earth Justice believes nations could do a whole lot more to enforce both international rules when ships dock at their ports, as well as introducing their own rules. To that effect it has recently filed a petition, on behalf of a number of environmental NGOs, with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to pressure it to enforce stricter rules on both US and foreign-owned ships stopping off at its ports. Earth Justice says the EPA does, in fact, have legal authority once ships come within 200 miles of the country's coastline, so it can enforce its own strict pollution standards on ships, regardless of whether they are locally or foreign-owned. The NGOs involved essentially wants to see stricter rules on fuel efficiency as well as the use of cleaner fuels. Oceana, one of the environmental groups petitioning the EPA is warning that if nothing is done, ""shipping pollution will increase substantially, potentially doubling from 2002 levels by 2020 and tripling by 2030.""

"(CNN) -- Jurors heard differing stories Thursday about the final moments of a 55-year-old Florida woman, with prosecutors claiming her millionaire husband callously shot her while his lawyers characterized her death as a ""tragic"" accident. After three days of jury selection, James ""Bob"" Ward's trial kicked off in Orlando with opening statements and testimony. Ward, 63, is charged with second-degree murder over the September 21, 2009, death of his wife inside their upscale Windermere home. ""Diane Ward was killed by a single gunshot wound as she struggled with her husband over a loaded a gun,"" the defendant's attorney Kirk Kirkconnell said. ""This entire incident happened in a blink of an eye. Her death was an unexpected and tragic accident."" But prosecutors painted a very different picture, casting doubt on Ward's unruffled demeanor and what they characterized as his ever-changing story of what happened. ""This case is about the fact that it was Bob Ward that shot her almost dead between the eyes,"" said Assistant State Attorney Robin Wilkinson in her opening statement. She brought up the 911 call, placed at 7:50 p.m. that night, in which Ward called and flatly said, ""I just shot my wife."" But later in the call, according to Wilkinson, he started to change his story: ""It becomes an accident and he doesn't know what happened ... Diane just ended up on the floor."" According to the arrest affidavit from Orange County Sheriff's Office, the victim was found in the master bedroom -- ""a large pool of blood at the top of her head (and) a .357 Magnum hand gun (in) the top drawer of a nightstand next to the bed."" Ward told police that the couple were the only ones in the house at the time, besides their four dogs. Wilkinson also brought up how Ward acted upon arriving at the police station, during which investigators described him as ""calm, polite and not really in distress."" In several videos from an interrogation room -- which the prosecutor promised would be played in court -- Ward offered an array of stories in phone conversations with family and friends, from ""It was a tragic accident"" to ""Diane killed herself."" The next day, medical examiner Joshua Stephany determined preliminarily that the mother of two college-age children had been killed in a homicide. Prosecutors, in opening statements, highlighted the financial troubles facing Ward -- who, along with his wife, had been set to testify in bankruptcy proceedings related to one of his companies a few days before the shooting. Kirkconnell, though, insisted that in no way did his client benefit from his wife's death: ""From a financial standpoint, the death of Diane Ward ruined Bob Ward financially,"" he said.","James ""Bob"" Ward is charged with second-degree murder in wife's death .
Prosecutors say he shot Diane Ward, then tried to change his story .

"(CNN) -- I'm a little nervous about flying right now. You can guess why. An airplane takes off from Malaysia's main airport and disappears. An international coalition of countries has been searching for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 for more than a week without success. How does an airplane disappear? Closer to home, a U.S. Airways flight blows a tire on takeoff and smartphone pictures show the plane's nose hitting the ground. Fortunately, the pilot manages to land without seriously injuring anyone. A Delta Air Lines aircraft loses a panel on one of its wings during a flight from Orlando, Florida, to Atlanta. It also lands safely. These scary-sounding mishaps are smaller reminders that things can and do go wrong . Despite how rare airline accidents are, many travelers get nervous when major -- and even relatively minor -- incidents occur. It's not rational thinking. The odds of dying in an airplane crash are really low. There were 35.1 million commercial flights worldwide, and 15 fatal accidents with 414 fatalities in 2012, the last full year for which the International Air Transport Association has Ascend Flightglobal data. And the odds are even better if you only flew within the United States: There were no airline fatalities in the U.S. in 2012, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. You know you're more likely to die in a car crash. More than 33,000 people died in motor vehicle crashes in 2012 in the United States alone. Also specific to the United States, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's 2012 Traffic Safety Facts Data reports a fatality rate of 1.14 fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled. Over the course of your lifetime, you're more likely to die by killing yourself (1 in 106), drowning (1 in 1,112) or choking on your food (1 in 3,842), according to the National Safety Council. Now that we know all that data, why do air disasters still unnerve us? The mind was built to flee . From an evolutionary perspective, the mind's primary objective is to look out for anything that might harm us and avoid it at all costs, says Julie Pike, a psychologist at the Anxiety Disorders Treatment Center in Durham, North Carolina. This has helped people live longer for thousands of years, she says. This discomfort over this latest airline incident reminds us how little control we have over many aspects of our lives. ""We like to be able to see, hear and control where we're going and what we're doing; we like situations in which we believe we could make an exit if necessary, grab the wheel, or jump out of the way,"" says Pike, via e-mail. ""With flying, that's impossible."" This is one weird airline mystery . Commercial airline pilot and aviation author Patrick Smith says the intense media coverage causes people to lose track of the fact that, despite occasional tragedies, commercial flying has never been safer than it is right now. ""Worldwide, the trend over the past several years has been one of steady improvement, to the point where last year was the safest in the entire history of commercial aviation,"" says Smith, who blogs about air travel at askthepilot.com, via e-mail. ""Hopefully their number continues to diminish, but a certain number of accidents will always be inevitable."" ""In some ways, the weirdness of the Malaysia Airlines story speaks to how well we have engineered away what once were the most common causes of crashes. Those that still occur tend to be more mysterious and strange than in decades past."" Airline fatalities are rare, but the possibility is still scary. What can we do about it? Face your fear . Don't try to run from the fear, suggests Pike. ""Rather than trying to control the plane, work on accepting the desire to control it,"" she says. ""Thank your mind for trying to protect you. Focus on simply noticing the thoughts, feelings and sensations without attaching to them or trying to make them go away."" Tell the crew you're scared, suggests flight attendant Heather Poole, author of ""Cruising Attitude: Tales of Crashpad, Crew Drama, and Crazy Passengers at 35,000 Feet."" ""If we know you're scared, we'll go out of our way to be reassuring if the airplane does encounter a few bumps,"" says Poole, via e-mail. ""We'll update you on whatever information the captain passes along to us regarding delays, mechanicals, weather or turbulence. I've gone as far as to sit in an empty seat beside someone and hold their hand."" Poole, who's been a flight attendant for 18 years, suggests passengers who hate turbulence sit close to the cockpit -- the front of the plane isn't as bumpy as the rear. Passengers can also download the MyRadar app to track the bumpy weather. Or how about a prayer? Artist's Way author Julia Cameron writes out prayers for her specific fears of flying: takeoff, turbulence and landing. She also takes a nice stack of gossip magazines: ""Buy tabloids. Celebrity gossip is engrossing. Celebrity cellulite can make you forget turbulence.""","The disappearance of Malaysia Flight 370 has made some nervous fliers more nervous .
Statistics are on the flier's side: More people die in car accidents than in airplane crashes .

"(CNN) -- Michael Dunn will have to wait another day -- at least -- to learn his fate. He is charged with first-degree murder in the November 2012 death of 17-year-old Jordan Davis, one of four black teenagers who were in an SUV shot by Dunn -- who is white -- in violence that flared from an argument over loud music. The Jacksonsville, Florida, jury in Dunn's case deliberated all day Friday, only to send a message to the judge shortly before 7 p.m. that they had ""reached a wall for the evening."" In other words, for the second straight day they hadn't reached a decision. With that, Judge Russell Healey gave them the OK to head back to their hotel so that they could return for deliberations around 9 a.m. Saturday. ""This is one admirable group,"" Healey told the court shortly before dismissing the jury. ""They are clearly taking this thing as seriously as they should. And I couldn't be more proud of them for how hard they are working."" This announcement capped a relatively uneventful day Friday, after what had been an emotional and eventful trial. The closest thing to news came shortly before 5 p.m., when Judge Healey answered a question from the jury: Is it possible to not reach a verdict on one count and reach a verdict on other counts? To which Healey responded: Yes. Prosecutors contend that Dunn's firing into the SUV equates to an act of murder. In addition to that count, Dunn also has been charged with three counts of attempted murder. If found guilty, he faces up to life in prison. A ""comprehensive public safety plan"" has been established ahead of a verdict in the case, according to the Duval County joint information center handling the Dunn trial. ""All contingencies have been planned for,"" the Duval County statement said. ""We will not discuss the specifics of any security plan. We will continue to protect the rights of those who choose to peaceably demonstrate."" Trial draws comparisons to another Florida case . The Dunn case has drawn parallels to the trial of George Zimmerman in the killing of teenager Trayvon Martin, which like the current trial had racial overtones and claims of self-defense. Dunn defense attorney Cory Strolla told CNN's Chris Cuomo on Friday that the Zimmerman and Dunn cases aren't so similar in his mind. There was a physical confrontation between Zimmerman and Martin, and police gave Zimmerman the benefit of the doubt about defending himself, Strolla said. ""My client did not wait to become that victim; my client did not wait to either get assaulted by a weapon or have someone potentially pull a trigger,"" he said. Unlike the Zimmerman case, police rushed to charge Dunn with murder, the defense attorney said. ""They already made up their mind before they even had the evidence basically looked at and put together,"" he said. Even though a weapon was never found, Strolla maintains the youths could have had one. Dunn felt threatened and acted to defend himself, he said. ""Now, does it sound irrational? Of course it sounds irrational. But have you ever been in that situation?"" Strolla said. Jurors on Thursday asked to see surveillance video from the gas station where Dunn shot Davis. The video contains 20 minutes of footage from multiple angles, though a shorter version showing only one angle was slated to be shown in court. In closing arguments Wednesday, prosecutors said inconsistencies between Dunn's words and actions undermined his assertion he acted in self-defense when he fatally shot the teen. His attorney countered the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt his client was guilty. He pleaded with jurors to find Dunn not guilty. In testimony Tuesday, Dunn said he fired in self-defense after the teen threatened him with a gun. ""My intent was to stop the attack, not necessarily end a life,"" he said. ""It just worked out that way."" Defendant says he was 'crazy with grief' 'There was no gun' But Assistant State Attorney Erin Wolfson said Wednesday that Dunn's claims don't add up. She noted that Dunn fired 10 shots at the SUV, three of them while the car was fleeing. He never took cover -- but instead opened his car door -- even though he would later tell detectives he had seen a weapon, she said. ""There was no gun,"" Wolfson told jurors. In addition, she said, he did not tell his fiancee, Rhonda Rouer, that he had seen a weapon until more than a month later. Dunn also left the scene of the shooting, went back to a hotel where they were staying and walked his dog, she said. And he returned the next day to his house -- more than two hours away -- all without calling 911, Wolfson said. Opinion: Did Florida shooter make his case on the stand? 'Rap crap' Dunn has testified he described the music to his fiancee as ""rap crap."" In the parking lot, as the music blared, ""his blood started to boil; he didn't like the music that was coming out of the car next to him; he got angrier and angrier,"" Wolfson said. Dunn rolled down his window and asked the youths to turn it down, which they did, but then turned it back up, Wolfson said. ""He got angry at the fact that a 17-year-old kid decided not to listen to him,"" she said, adding that Dunn then pulled a 9 mm gun out of his glove box and shot ""systematically and methodically"" at the SUV. ""Nobody denied that Jordan was talking back. But this defendant took it upon himself to silence Jordan Davis forever."" Dunn testified Tuesday that he saw Davis reach down and pick something up, and that he saw about ""4 inches of a barrel"" from a 12- or 20-gauge shotgun above the window. Opinion: Florida shooter saw black, thought 'threat' 'You're not going to kill me' He muttered aloud to himself, "" 'You're not going to kill me, you son of a bitch,' "" as he opened the glove compartment, grabbed his pistol, dropped the holster at his feet, chambered a round and began firing, he said. Nine of the 10 rounds hit the car, and three of them struck Davis, one of them cutting through his liver, his lung and his aorta. Wolfson rejected Dunn's assertion he had been trying to de-escalate the situation and he feared for his life. Strolla, the defense attorney, noted that no witnesses had accused Dunn of using any hate words and testified that his client had just come from a wedding, where his ex-wife said he had appeared to be in a good mood. Strolla noted that the SUV departed the gas station after the shooting and was gone for three minutes before it returned, enough time for the youths to have dumped a gun. Detectives did not search the area for days after the shooting, he said. The court has decided not to release the identifications of the jurors, fearing they could be the subject of threats, but a court document shows the jury is made up of four white females, two black females, four white males, an Asian female and a Hispanic male, plus four alternates.

"Washington (CNN) -- Julian Castro, the mayor of San Antonio, and Mike Villarreal, the city's representative in the state legislature, saw potential in an historic, amoeba-shaped park parcel near the city's convention center. So, the two set to work. They secured the civic support, government approval and funding needed to turn HemisFair Park into a place where playgrounds and mixed income housing will one day overlook a grassy span and the Tower of the Americas â€” an observation tower marking the park's location as the site of the 1968 World's Fair. As President Barack Obama's choice to become the next housing secretary, a focus on helping revitalize inner-city areas, colleagues in Texas say, will stand the 39-year-old mayor in good stead. ""Based on his focus here in San Antonio on working to improve housing in the city's core and inner city, I suspect he would advance an agenda that has in mind family and children,"" said Villarreal, who is vying to replace Castro as mayor. ""I think you're going to be seeing a secretary of housing who understands housing on a human level."" Obama 's new pick for HUD secretary . If confirmed, Castro would head an agency that is still reeling from fallout from the housing crisis â€” including meeting mushrooming demands for affordable rental housing. He will also be tasked with helping the financially beleaguered Federal Housing Administration, which has been struggling to cope with a record number of home mortgage defaults. Obama noted during the nomination ceremony that Castro ""never forgets where he comes from."" He also highlighted Castro's mention of his Mexican-born grandmother in his keynote address to the Democratic convention in 2012 as an immigrant who worked hard to provide a home for her family. ""For her and generations like her a home is more than just a house,"" Obama said. Castro will likely face questions in his confirmation hearings why San Antonio did not follow federal guidelines when it spent millions in HUD funds aimed at helping address the housing crisis during his tenure as mayor, according to a 2012 report by the agency's inspector general. The report found the city did not use a competitive bid process when it awarded $2.5 million for renovation contracts and that it did not follow federal affordability guidelines designed to target lower income residents when it spent just over $1 million to buy and fix up homes. A call to Castro's San Antonio office seeking comment about his HUD nomination was not immediately returned. Still, supporters feel Castro has the right mix of experience to lead the agency. ""This economy has not been as robust as we would have hoped,"" Henry Cisneros, a former HUD secretary and former San Antonio mayor told CNN on Friday. ""Part of the reason for that has been because the housing sector has been on the sidelines. But now housing can get into the fray and, as HUD secretary, Castro is well-poised to do that."" Cisneros, who says he has discussed housing-related issues with Castro in the past and plans on having additional conversations with him, said that as mayor of San Antonio, the younger man dealt with issues of poverty, homelessness and home affordability and is well suited to the task. Opinion: Why Julian Castro said yes to Obama . Texas political consultant Bill Miller also feels Castro is up to the challenge. ""He'll be a cool customer. He's not going to get supercharged or over wrought over anything,"" said Miller who is a founding partner at HillCo Partners in Austin, a state political consulting group. ""If there have been problems and challenges at the agency he's not going to be let's throw the baby out with the bathwater."" Castro's appointment also would be a win for Democrats looking to add diversity to its national roster of potential candidates and put Texas in play in 2016 as well as help smooth over tensions with Latinos who are frustrated over a lack of an immigration reform overhaul, said Julian Zelizer, a Princeton University historian and CNN contributor. ""In terms of the Democrats and Obama, it is at least symbolic of the party's commitment to immigration and immigration reform,"" Zelizer said. ""It does elevate his status. It makes him a national figure rather than a local figure."" Castro, the son of political activists, is the youngest mayor of a major American city. His meteoric rise from local government to being called upon to take on a Cabinet-level position is a political narrative tailor-made for primetime. He and his twin brother, Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, were picked to take the stage at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte. The congressman introduced his brother who in turn gave a keynote address that was memorable for both his young daughter's charming hair flip and his tale of a second-generation, Mexican-American immigrant's successful rise. ""My grandmother never owned a house. She cleaned other people's houses so she could afford to rent her own. But she saw her daughter become the first in her family to graduate from college,"" he said during the 2012 address. ""And my mother fought hard for civil rights so that instead of a mop, I could hold this microphone."" Mayors' stories out of school . Beyond the immigrant son-made-good narrative, Castro brings a ""new energy"" to the President's second term, said Trey Martinez Fischer, a Democratic Texas state representative who heads that body's Mexican American Legislative Caucus. ""It's very important to note is that he brings a fresh perspective and new energy to this President's second term, Fischer said. ""He could serve as a pick me up for an administration that's been in place for some time.""","Julian Castro is a Democratic rising star tapped by president to head HUD .

"(CNN) -- Potential jurors in Casey Anthony's first-degree murder trial were asked during jury selection in May if they could look at the remains of a victim as simply evidence and not let their emotions sway them one way or the other. This week, jurors in the Florida mother's trial for the death of her daughter, Caylee, were put to the test. Week 3 of the trial began with forensic testimony about how someone searched for ""chloroform"" and ""neck-breaking"" on the computer in the home Anthony shared with her parents in Orange County. By Thursday, panelists were fully immersed in the physical reality of the 2-year-old's death: bones, decomposition, odor and all. The prosecution called key forensic witnesses, who described in graphic detail, the state of Caylee's remains when she was found in a wooded area on Dec. 11, 2008, six months after she went missing. ""This is the skull with the hair and tape along with some leaf litter and other debris that was received at the same time as the other specimens,"" Orange County Chief Deputy Medical Examiner Dr. Gary Utz said on Thursday as he described a photo of Caylee's remains. Jurors saw images of the tiny, decaying shorts and Winnie the Pooh blanket found with Caylee's remains. Animals had chewed up Caylee's bones by the time law enforcement discovered them, according to testimony. At times, the typically stone-faced defendant bowed her head and tried to avoid looking at graphic images of her daughter's remains. On Thursday, Anthony broke into tears and was deemed ""ill"" by Judge Belvin Perry. Court ended abruptly to allow her to recover. Anthony, 25, faces seven counts in Caylee's death, including first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse and misleading investigators. If convicted, she could face the death penalty. Anthony has denied having anything to do with her daughter's death. Her defense team asserts Caylee's death was an accidental drowning that ""snowballed out of control."" Defense lawyer Jose Baez attorney said in his opening statement that Caylee drowned in the family pool shortly after her family last reported seeing her and that Casey Anthony and her father, George Anthony, panicked upon discovering the body and covered up her death. George Anthony denied that scenario in his testimony the first week of the trial. Beginning Thursday, jurors saw dozens of photos and heard hours of testimony on the remains. Despite objections from the defense, jurors saw a video in which images of Caylee's skull and the duct tape found across the front of it at the scene were superimposed over a photo of a Caylee alive, smiling, with her mother. The prosecution argued the video showed how the duct tape could have covered both Caylee's nose and mouth, while the defense argued it was only designed to appeal to juror emotions. Dr. Jan Garavaglia, star of the Discovery Channel's ""Dr. G. Medical Examiner"" and chief medical examiner in the case, offered some of the most compelling testimony of the week. Garavaglia, who examined the child's remains, testified Friday she could not say for sure how Caylee died . But, homicide is ""the only logical conclusion,"" she said. During cross-examination, defense attorney Cheney Mason questioned Garavaglia's method of evaluating the manner of death, suggesting that forensic evidence, and not outside facts of the case, should determine her conclusion. Garavaglia defended her method, saying the cause of death can rarely be determined without outside information. ""The fact that it's tossed in a field to rot in bags is a clear indication that the body was trying to be hidden,"" Garavaglia said during cross examination. ""It being put in a bag is a very big red flag for homicide, never seen in an accidental death for a child, and the fact that there's duct tape attached anywhere to that child's face is to me indication of a homicide."" The trunk . By Saturday, testimony reached discussion of bugs and larvae found in Anthony's trunk, where the prosecution alleges Caylee's body was kept in garbage bags for days after her mother knocked her out with chloroform and taped her nose and mouth. While forensic entomologist Neal Haskell credited the bugs to decomposition, the defense argued and Haskell admitted the bugs could be attributed to a trash bag found in the trunk. The prosecution also called Arpad Vass, a senior research scientist at Tennessee's Oak Ridge National Laboratory, who testified Monday about his examination of items from the trunk. Vass said he was ""shocked"" by the high level of chloroform in the trunk carpet sample and had an immediate reaction when he opened the can containing the sample. ""I essentially jumped back a foot or two,"" Vass said, before confirming to Assistant State Attorney Jeff Ashton that he believed the smell was human decomposition. ""The odor was extremely overwhelming. I was shocked that that little bitty can could have that much odor associated with it."" During a combative cross-examination, defense lawyer Baez attempted to cast doubt on Vass' testimony, accusing him of having a financial interest in the case and questioning his testing methods. Vass acknowledged that he has a pending patent on a device designed to detect clandestine graves. But he rejected the suggestion that his testimony in the high-profile trial could potentially inspire interest in the device and its applications. The dogs . Tuesday and Wednesday brought key testimony of the four-legged variety. Deputy Jason Forgey of the Orange County Sheriff's Office, and Sergeant Kristin Brewer of the Osceola County Sheriff's Office, detailed the efforts of cadaver dogs Gerus and Bones, who searched critical areas in search of human remains. Gerus detected human decomposition in both Anthony's car and in the Anthony's back yard, Forgey testified. Brewer told jurors that Bones picked up the possible presence of human remains in the backyard near Caylee's playhouse. Images of Caylee's bright plastic playhouse were shown to jurors for demonstration. During cross examination, Forgey and Brewer agreed that the dogs are not infallible when it comes to identifying remains and, ""like humans,"" are imperfect. The computers . Though Wednesday and Thursday's testimony on computer forensics was less graphic compared to what was to come, it represented some of the prosecution's most critical evidence so far. Through the testimony of three computer experts, the prosecution worked to establish premeditation, a factor essential to convicting Anthony of first-degree capital murder. Searches conducted on the Anthony family computer on March 17 and 21 of 2008 included ""chloroform,"" ""how to make chloroform,"" ""household weapons"" and ""neck-breaking,"" according to testimony. ""Chloroform"" was searched for 84 times, according to the testimony of John Bradley, who developed the computer program used by investigators to locate the searches. During cross examination, Bradley agreed it is impossible to know for sure how much time was spent on each page viewed, and that some of the terms searched, like ""hand-to-hand combat"" and ""self defense,"" appeared to have no relation to a case involving the death of a 2-year-old. Week 4 is expected to bring the close of the prosecution's case and possibly the start of the defense. Only a few prosecution witnesses remain, including a trace-evidence analyst and a tattoo artist Casey Anthony visited in the weeks following her daughter's disappearance.","First part of week's testimony focuses on computer searches for ""chloroform,"" ""neck-breaking""

"(CNN) -- The Army-Navy game this Saturday marks the 120th anniversary of the great football rivalry. Their first game, played on a gridiron laid out on southeast corner of the West Point Parade Ground, was so sparsely attended that spectators could move up and down the field as the line of scrimmage shifted. We have come a long way from that first encounter, but as Army and Navy get ready to play again, the legacy of that 1890 game is worth recalling. In 1890 Army had only one player with any real football experience -- Dennis Michie, in whose honor today's West Point's football stadium is named. As a result Army was trounced 24-0 by a Navy team that had been playing football since 1886. The next year Army hired a part-time coach, played a series of early-season games, and with Michie (who would die tragically in the Spanish-American War) once again leading the way, Army avenged its earlier loss by a 32-16 score. Both teams could now claim bragging rights. Their competition had gotten off to the perfect start. Five years before the advent of the modern Olympics, the two service academies had turned their new athletic rivalry into front-page news. The Army-Navy game, as those reporting it noted, quickly became as much about character as physical skill. ""Pluck was the most conspicuous feature of the game of football at West Point on Saturday between the cadets of the Naval and Military Academies,"" an 1890 account observed. ""Where bravery was so common and so notable it would be unfair and unjust to cite one man as braver than another."" The public's response to that first encounter worked to the advantage of both schools, and they went out of their way to make sure their rivalry remained consistent with the military values they sought to display on the gridiron. When in the wake of the 1893 game, which drew a crowd of 8,000, animosities between the two academies reached such a fever pitch that a retired rear admiral and a brigadier general came close to fighting a duel, the game was canceled for six years by order of the secretary of war and secretary of the Navy. The lessons the cancellation taught were absorbed by both sides, and when the game resumed in 1899 on a neutral site, Franklin Field in Philadelphia, before 27,000 people, everything went so smoothly that Army and Navy officials decided that the game must be played annually. Making sure their football rivalry did not deteriorate into petty squabbles paid further dividends two years later when President Theodore Roosevelt and 30,000 fans attended the 1901 Army-Navy game. The president became so excited about the play, which featured a 105-yard kickoff return by Army's star quarterback, that at one point he left his seat and moved to the sidelines to get closer to the action. But Roosevelt was careful, despite having served as assistant secretary of the Navy, to maintain public neutrality. At halftime he inaugurated the presidential tradition of moving from one team's side of the stadium to the other's. Since TR's time, the Army-Navy football game has always had a life of its own. In his memoir, ""You Have to Pay the Price,"" legendary Army coach Earl ""Red' Blaik wrote, ""The primary objective of Army football must be victory over Navy. It cannot be achieved by anything less than complete dedication."" For Navy's coaches victory over Army has the same priority. Coaches at both schools know that success in the Army-Navy game is crucial to keeping their jobs. How far this pressure to win goes is epitomized by the story former Army coach Paul Dietzel tells in his autobiography, ""Call Me Coach,"" of a dinner party at the home of Gen. William Westmoreland, later commander of American troops in Vietnam, who while superintendent of West Point hired Dietzel in 1962 to revive Army's football fortunes. ""There's one thing you'll need to understand right from the beginning,"" the general's wife, Kitsy, told Dietzel. Then, turning around, she flipped up her skirt to reveal a pair of blank panties with ""BEAT NAVY!"" printed on them in bright gold letters. In 1944, when Army, led by its All-American running backs ""Doc"" Blanchard and Glenn Davis, was ranked No.1 in the nation and Navy, with a line superior to Army's, was ranked No.2, they played an epic game, won by Army, that helped sell more than $58 million in war bonds. At the game's conclusion, sports' columnist Allison Danzig wrote, ""The country can now return to the normalcy of fighting the most terrible war ever inflicted upon mankind. The Army-Navy game has passed into history."" But an even more revealing comment on the place the Army-Navy football game had come to occupy in World War II America was summed up by a telegram that General Douglas MacArthur, then leading American forces in the Pacific, sent to Army's coach in 1944. ""THE GREATEST OF ALL ARMY TEAMS,"" MacArthur wired. ""WE HAVE STOPPED THE WAR TO CELEBRATE YOUR MAGNIFICENT SUCCESS."" MacArthur's hyperbole was deliberate, but there was nothing exaggerated about his belief that the Army-Navy game should serve as an antidote to dark times. When the Army-Navy game of 1963 was canceled as a result of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, it was played a week later at the request of the Kennedy family, and the coin that President Kennedy would have flipped to decide which team received the opening kickoff was sent as a gift by Secretary of the Army Cyrus Vance to Navy's winning football captain Tom Lynch. The following year, with the Vietnam War in its early stages, retired President Dwight Eisenhower, then living in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, put his own stamp on the Army-Navy game. Ike, a 1915 West Point graduate, had desperately wanted to be a football star, and in 1912 he was heralded as one of the best running backs in the East. A knee injury ended his football career and kept him out of the 1912 Army-Navy game, but over the years, Ike maintained his interest in Army football. When he was asked by a cadet interviewing him for West Point's student-run Pointer magazine to send the 1964 Army team a telegram on the eve of the game, he happily complied. The telegram was designed to rally Army's players, who had lost five straight games to Navy, then led by All-American quarterback and future Dallas Cowboys star Roger Staubach. But what emerged from Ike's telegram was much more than a call for victory. For Ike, the essence of the Army-Navy game was the pressure it put on everyone who participated in it to hold nothing back. ""You will always have what you give today. The more you give the more you will keep!"" Ike wrote in a message that is as relevant today as it was in 1964. Army-Navy football remains a stellar attraction but it has suffered from the increased competition for fans' attention at the pro and college ranks. That doesn't, however, take away from what the game stands for. This year's game, like those of the past, marks the last time most of both teams' seniors will ever step on a football field. As they have known ever since they arrived at West Point and Annapolis, what awaits them is not a tryout in the National Football League or a lucrative job in business, but active service, which these days amounts to a five-year commitment. In no other athletic rivalry is the price of participation higher. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nicolaus Mills.","The Army-Navy game on Saturday marks the 120th anniversary of the football rivalry .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Days after thick snow brought London to a standstill, the traditional drizzle has returned and it is business as usual in the bustling British capital. The snowmen who populated London during the heaviest snowfall in 18 years are looking worse for wear. The pavement might be slippery with ice but the resumption of the bus and rail services means that you'll at least be able to move around the city. All airports in the south are operating normally -- albeit with some delays -- so there's no excuse to stay away. With that in mind, CNN Business Traveller has compiled a guide for visitors to the city. It is still wise to bring an umbrella, but this week you may want to throw in a couple of ski poles. Time zone: London is currently on Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), five hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time and eight hours behind Hong Kong. From the airport: Non-stop train services link Gatwick, Heathrow and Stansted aiports with central London. The Heathrow Express takes 15 minutes to Paddington Station and costs from $24 (£16.50) for a single journey. The London Underground costs only $6 (£4) but takes an hour. A breakfast meeting: Visitors with a healthy budget and appetite might want to start the day at the Grand Café in The Wolseley (160 Piccadilly, W1J) where you where you can buy a traditional fry-up or ""The English"" for just shy of $20 (£13.50). A budget option with no less of a London flavor can be found at the The Cock Tavern (East Poultry Avenue, EC1A) in the heart of Smithfield Market. Meat has been traded there for 800 years and early in the morning you can still see butchers plying their trade in bloodied coats. For dinner: Impress with a table at one of London's most famous restaurants, Le Gavroche (43 Upper Brook Street, W1K) or Gordon Ramsay at Claridge's (Brook Street, W1K) . For a cheaper option try a traditional pie and mash shop, the once staple of working class East London life. One of the oldest is M Manze (87 Tower Bridge Road, SE1) that sells jellied eels as well as pie and mash amid the traditional decor of tiled walls, wooden benches and white marble table-tops. For a drink: Two of the oldest London pubs include Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese (145 Fleet Street, EC4A) in the City of London and The Prospect of Whitby (57 Wapping Wall, E1W) a short walk along the Thames from Canary Wharf. For one of the best hotel bars try the Lanesborough (Hyde Park Corner, SW1X) and One Aldwych (1 Aldwych, WC2B). High-flyers can also take in the view over a drink at Vertigo 42, the champagne bar atop Tower 42 (25 Old Broad Street, EC2N). Tipping: Expect to tip around 10 percent in restaurants and cabs, but no tips are expected in bars. On a fine afternoon (they do exist):  Visit St James's Park to seek out its pelicans and to catch a view of Buckingham Palace from the bridge on the lake. Then walk via Westminster Abbey to Waterloo Bridge for spectacular views of The Palace of Westminster, Somerset House and Victoria Embankment. Finish with a ride on the London Eye. Staying dry: Improve your swing at one of London's indoor golf centers. Urban Golf (Soho and Smithfield) features eight simulators, two putting greens, a bar and lounge and coaching. Shelter can also be found in some of London's iconic department stores. Harrods and Harvey Nichols are both in Knightsbridge. Opening hours: Most shops and businesses are open from 9 a.m. or 10 a.m. until 6 p.m. Larger stores in central London stay open till 7 p.m or 8 p.m. and later on Thursdays. What to avoid: The crowds of tourists in Leicester Square, the Trocadero and the ubiquitous Scottish Steakhouses in London's West End. Transport: Be warned: a single-stop tube journey in central London costs $8 (£4). To save money buy an Oyster card, which can be used on London's underground (£1.60 per single-stop journey), buses, trams and some overland rail services. Black cabs can be hailed anywhere. Fares are high but the pay-off is that all drivers must pass the ""Knowledge"" -- an in-depth exam on navigating around London -- which means they really do know where they are going. Don't miss in February: In 2009 the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew (Richmond, TW9) is celebrating its 250th anniversary with a ""Tropical Extravaganza"" of exotic plants in one of its conservatories. The Natural History Museum (Cromwell Road, SW7) is commemorating the bicentenary of Charles Darwin's birth and 150th year of the publication of On the Origin of Species with a major exhibition. A number of star-studded plays have also just opened in London's theatreland. Imelda Staunton, star of Harry Potter, is in Joe Orton's Entertaining Mr Sloane (Trafalgar Studios until April 11). James McAvoy is in Richard Greenberg's Three Days of Rain (Apollo Theatre until May 2). What to pack: February is a particularly bleak and cold month in Britain so pack an umbrella and warm clothes. For a handy keepsake of the city, buy an umbrella on arrival from James Smith & Sons (53 New Oxford Street, WC1A). The shop has hardly changed since it opened in 1830 and offers an impressive range of umbrellas and essential gentlemen's accessories. Oh, and don't forget to pack thermals and some decent footwear.

"(CNN) -- The recent spate of stories about the Rev. Al Sharpton's history as an informant for the FBI don't exactly qualify as breaking news: solid newspaper reports at least a quarter century old, detailing Sharpton's maneuvers at the treacherous intersection of federal agents, violent gangsters, and shady music industry operators. In his autobiography, Sharpton himself writes about the days in the late 1980s when he wore a wire and collected data on criminals for the feds. But the publication of FBI memos naming Sharpton, (aka Confidential Informant #7) seems jarring because of how far Sharpton has traveled into the political mainstream. Back in the 1980s, he was a street agitator with a relentless hunger for media attention. Today he hosts a top-rated national television show and a three-hour radio talk show that airs in dozens of markets nationwide. The Sharpton of the 1980s registered on the political radar of City Hall as a nuisance, dismissively dubbed ""Al Charlatan"" by then-mayor Ed Koch. This week, Mayor Bill de Blasio will speak on the opening day of Sharpton's annual conference, and the keynote address will be delivered by President Barack Obama, who regularly gives Sharpton exclusive interviews and private visits to the White House. That's why Sharpton took offense to the disparaging tabloid headlines referring to him as ""Rev. Rat"" and as a snitch. ""I was not, and am not, a rat because I was not with the rats. I'm a cat,"" Sharpton told a group of reporters at a news conference, chastising reporters for suggesting that his efforts to help nab criminals were motivated by such things as avoiding prosecution, rather than a genuine civic effort to help law enforcement officials. Whatever Sharpton's reasons, he did society a favor by helping to expose the outright criminality that was prevalent in the music industry. For decades, crooks had a stranglehold on popular music, according to ""Hit Men,"" Frederic Dannen's 1990, eye-opening book about the hoodlums, artists and executives who routinely resorted to blackmail, extortion, payola and outright violence as business tools. Among the tales picked up on Sharpton's wire was information on Morris Levy, a legend in the music business who owned nightspots, including Birdland, in New York, and the rights to scores of hit songs. Levy, a roughneck from the Bronx, described himself as a boyhood friend of Vincent (The Chin) Gigante, who eventually rose to become boss of the Genovese crime family. Levy had deep financial ties to members of the organization, selling part of one of his record companies to a gangster named Tommy Eboli, who was later shot to death in 1972, according to the Los Angeles Times. Levy also reportedly set up a friend and enforcer named Nate McCalla with his own record label, called Calla, which made records for soul singers. McCalla was found murdered in a Florida hotel room in 1980. And according to Sharpton's secret recordings, Levy was in up to his neck with Gigante and the Genovese organization financially, using his legitimate businesses to help the mobsters acquire property and -- allegedly -- move heroin. Levy was eventually sentenced to 10 years in prison for conspiracy to commit extortion. He'd arranged the severe beating of a record industry associate who owed money, but wouldn't pay. Levy died of cancer shortly before he was due to report to prison. These were the types of men Sharpton was dealing with in the 1980s as he tried to work with independent black music promoters trying to break into the business. Having served for a decade as road manager for singer James Brown, Sharpton knew the industry gangers were not to be trifled with. When Genovese associates threatened to kill Sharpton for challenging their stranglehold on music, Sharpton says, he ran straight to the FBI, who in turn asked him to wear a wire and help gather evidence against the mobsters. The strategy seems to have worked: Many of the Genovese hoods that Sharpton spoke to or heard about ended up behind bars, including Gigante, who died in prison in 2005. The good reverend, meanwhile, moved further into mainstream grassroots politics and maintains to this day that he did nothing wrong. Sharpton, in fact, makes the valid point that many black communities suffer high crime rates because of a destructive ""stop snitching"" attitude of non-cooperation with police -- and that his wearing a wire for the FBI represents a move in a more positive direction. He's right. When confronted with death threats from organized crime, the logical action for law-abiding citizens is to report the problem to the authorities and help bring the criminals to justice. That is what Sharpton did, and you don't have to like his politics to conclude that, in this case, he made the best of a scary situation.","Errol Louis: Al Sharpton under new criticism for informing on criminals for FBI in 1980s .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- From today, travelers visiting the United States under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) risk being detained at airports and sent home if they don't comply with new U.S. immigration rules. Thousands of travelers risk being detained and sent home from U.S. airports and ports. The introduction of the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) means visitors from 27 VWP countries -- including most of Western Europe, New Zealand, Japan and Australia -- must now register their details online at least three days before departure. ESTA -- which came into effect today -- replaces the written green I-94 form and allows travelers under the VWP to enter the U.S. without a visa and stay for up to 90 days. The measure is designed to tighten security and make it harder for terrorists who are citizens of the participating countries to easily obtain entry to the U.S. Critics fear the new rule will be an inconvenience for business travelers and the British Foreign Office is concerned that travelers who have not heard about the new rules may be caught out. A British Foreign Office report on travel trends for 2009 predicted that 13 percent of British travelers are more likely to visit the States now Barack Obama has been elected.

"Charlotte, North Carolina (CNN) -- A smiling Ted Scott strides into the bustling caddy area at the Wells Fargo Championship in Charlotte, North Carolina, and sets down the golf bag marked ""Bubba Watson"" that defines his working life. The fresh-faced 37-year old is one of the lucky ones. Caddies for the top PGA Tour golfers can bring home as much as $250,000 a year in the modern game, traveling the world and taking a cut of everything their player earns along the way. Such rewards make for a fiercely competitive industry. These days, most caddies are college-educated and strong players in their own right -- a long way from the stereotype of disheveled, drunken hobos portrayed in movies like Caddyshack. ""It's changed a lot since I've been out here,"" says Scott, who took his first job in 2000, and counts 2008 U.S. Ryder Cup captain Paul Azinger among his former employers. ""There used to be guys in the parking lot at tournaments, and you could pick up a bag. Now I've got friends who are great caddies and can't get a job. You can earn a living out here, that's what's made the difference."" Scott's player is the big-hitting Watson, and the 32-year-old American is doing better than most. He's already won two PGA Tour tournaments in 2011, cashing checks for over $3 million and handing around 10% to his good friend on the bag. The pair started working together in 2006, when their mutual friend Ben Crane introduced them at the PGA Tour's weekly Bible study group. Watson agreed to give him a two-week trial and they've been together ever since. ""We're like brothers, brothers that Mom and Dad left alone -- and they left him in charge,"" Scott says. ""Sometimes I just want to punch him, but I love him. And I know he feels the same about me. But don't let anybody else say anything bad about us. We'll go into battle for each other."" Like a good number of his fellow PGA Tour caddies, Scott's first intention was to make it as a player. But after turning professional he struggled to make an impact, and ultimately had to make do with the next best thing. ""I turned pro and thought, 'I'm not ready for this,' so I went out to caddy to see what I needed to work on with my game. Here I am 10 years later,"" Scott says. ""Being a caddy wasn't my dream, but it's a dream now. To caddy for a great player, a guy that treats me well. If you have a nice player to work with it's a great job."" With a wife and two young daughters back home in Lafayette, Louisiana, Scott accepts there are sacrifices to be made for a life on the road. But while he often goes a week or two without seeing his family, there's a clear upside to his schedule. ""I sat down to work everything out once and there's no question I get more time with my wife and kids doing this, than I would in a normal job,"" Scott says. ""I work about half of the time, and the rest of the time I'm home all the time. I can take my daughter to school and pick her up. I don't just have to wait for the weekends. The only hard part is not getting to my wife and kids every day."" When it comes to the job in hand, Scott sees his role stretching a long way beyond the guy who hands Watson his clubs and measures yardages on the golf course. Watson is an emotional golfer, and the presence of a calming influence alongside him has proved invaluable in his recent successes. Scott is an integral part of what Watson calls ""Team Bubba,"" and he's been credited with bringing a new focus to one of the most naturally gifted golfers on the Tour. ""It takes a long time to learn someone. And that's the art of caddying -- you have to learn your player,"" Scott says. ""For Bubba it's about keeping him in the middle emotionally. You don't want him to get too excited, or too mad. He's extremely emotional. It's about trying to watch him and getting back to that middle point where he plays his best."" So what exactly does being Watson's caddy entail on a typical tournament day? ""I try to get to the course at least an hour and a half early. Bubba comes out about an hour before to start warming up, and I have to make sure I've got the bag ready -- make sure I've got a clean towel and all the rain gear ready,"" Scott says. ""We'll go to the putting green first and Bubba will putt for about 20 minutes. Then we'll go and hit balls, then Bubba will come back and putt some more. And then we'll go out and play the round."" Following the pair around the Quail Hollow course in Charlotte, it was obvious they share a tight bond. After five years working together Watson and Scott still have plenty to talk about, and appear completely relaxed in each other's company. When a tournament round ends, Scott can count himself fortunate Watson is ""not a big practice guy."" While some of his fellow caddies are out on the range for hours afterwards, tending to their players as they hit balls until the sun goes down, Scott has it easy. ""If he (Watson) didn't like a certain shot he might go and hit one or two, just to get a positive feel for it, but after that I'm off for the rest of the day,"" Scott says. ""So I go play golf myself, or play tennis, or hang out with my friends. Whatever I can do to entertain myself to the next day."" All in all it sounds like a pretty good life being a PGA Tour caddy -- especially when your player is as relaxed a character, and as a good a player as Watson is. Scott is one of the lucky ones, and he knows it. But while he and Watson have a friendship that's the envy of his fellow caddies, he's never in any doubt of who wears the pants in their relationship. ""We love to hang out, and have a lot of common interests. But we knock heads too, and he's in charge so I always have to submit,"" he says.

"(CNN) -- Belching smoke and fire, SpaceX's unmanned Dragon spacecraft successfully blasted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, Friday afternoon on a resupply mission to the International Space Station. ""I'm feeling pretty excited. This is a happy day,"" said SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk on NASA's space blog after the craft roared into space atop a Falcon 9 rocket. The Dragon is scheduled to rendezvous with the International Space Station Sunday morning. The station's robotic arm will capture the space freighter, bringing it in for a berth at the Harmony module port, NASA said. The space freighter is carrying 2.5 tons of cargo in its third resupply mission to the ISS, according to a NASA statement. The spacecraft's payload includes some 150 experiments that range from growing plants efficiently in space to investigating how the human immune system functions in microgravity. William Gerstenmaier, NASA's associate administrator for Human Exploration and Operations, said the planned experiments represent important research for the space program. The research ""will help us improve our understanding of how humans adapt to living in space for long periods of time and help us develop technologies that will enable deep space exploration."" The cargo mission will also deliver a set of high-tech legs for Robonaut 2. The legs will allow the robotic torso, which is already aboard the orbiting laboratory, better mobility to help with a variety of tasks aboard the space station. SpaceX is achieving some success with tests on reigniting the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage on descent, Musk said on the NASA space blog. The hope is that by refiring the stage for a soft ocean landing, it can be recovered intact and reusable. Also on Friday, the Falcon 9's second stage ejected five small satellites, called CubeSats, which will serve a number of research functions. The Dragon will remain at the ISS for a month. When it leaves, it will bring back almost 3,500 pounds of scientific experiments, hardware, supplies and tools. It's scheduled to splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, west of Baja, California, on May 18.","""This is a happy day,"" said SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk .

"(CNN) -- A man who police say was recently stabbed by the accuser in the 2006 Duke University lacrosse scandal has died, the Durham County, North Carolina, medical examiner's office confirmed Thursday. Reginald Daye, 46, died Wednesday at Duke University Hospital as a result of the stabbing earlier this month, Durham police said. Crystal Mangum, whose accusation of rape against three Duke athletes generated national attention and sparked debate over class and race, was charged with assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill and inflicting serious injury in the stabbing of Daye. Officers responding to a call found a man who had been stabbed in the torso and who was taken to the hospital for treatment of serious injuries, police said. They said they later arrested Mangum, described as the man's girlfriend, and that the stabbing occurred during a quarrel at the couple's shared apartment. Mangum, 32, was placed in the Durham County Jail without bond. As of Thursday morning, no additional warrant had been served against Mangum. Her next court date is April 25, officials said. ""The case remains under investigation and we do anticipate upgrading the charges,"" police spokeswoman Kammie Michael said. ""No new charges have been filed at this time and there is no court hearing scheduled for today."" In March 2006, Mangum claimed to have been sexually assaulted by three players on the Duke lacrosse team while performing as a stripper for a team party. North Carolina's attorney general later found no credible evidence that the attacks occurred and the charges were dropped. The scandal, however, forced the cancellation of the men's lacrosse season that year and the resignation of team coach Mike Pressler. It also led to widespread criticism of Durham County District Attorney Mike Nifong, who was later disbarred for his handling of the case. Mangum was arrested in February 2010 on attempted murder charges after a fight with her then-boyfriend. She also was accused of arson, identity theft and resisting arrest, among other charges. CNN affiliate WTVD-TV reported the arrest happened after she set fire to a pile of the boyfriend's clothes while her children were at home. In a June 2010 interview with the station, Mangum said her boyfriend had attacked her, and she said that her involvement in the Duke lacrosse case had influenced police handling of the case. ""I do feel that I am being unjustly treated because of preconceived notions about my character in the media,"" Mangum said at the time. In December, a jury found Mangum guilty of child abuse in the case but could not agree on a first-degree felony arson charge, which could have resulted in a seven-year sentence, WTVD reported.","The Duke lacrosse case garnered national attention .

"(CNN) -- Russia's annexation of Crimea should not affect the country's sports teams, says Russian national football team coach Fabio Capello. The Italian, who previously coached England, has dismissed calls for Russia to be kicked out of the upcoming World Cup in Brazil and for it to be stripped of the right to host the 2018 tournament. When asked by CNN if he understands why people could choose to boycott a World Cup in Russia, Capello said: ""I don't understand why you would boycott the World Cup or other sport competitions. ""Sport is out of politics, for me. I don't understand when someone boycotts a competition."" Two U.S. senators recently wrote a letter to football's global governing body FIFA calling for Russia to be expelled from the 2014 World Cup while also being stripped of its right to host the 2018 event. Two Russian politicians responded by sending a letter of their own to FIFA demanding the U.S. be kicked out of Brazil 2014 for previous aggressive actions against Yugoslavia, Iraq, Libya and recent action in Syria. Political controversy -- Russia's anti-gay propaganda law and a $50 billion budget -- also dominated the build-up to the recent Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics. Russia topped the medal table with 13 gold medals; success which Capello says has ramped up the pressure on his players ahead of the World Cup -- which begins on June 12. ""We are euphoric because a lot of medals go to Russia,"" said Capello. ""We are really proud of the results. ""But I've lived my career with pressure. I've managed really important teams and when you manage these teams you need to win -- the pressure is every day."" Russian president Vladimir Putin took a keen interest in the country's performance at Sochi 2014 and he will surely be hoping for a strong showing from the hosts at the 2018 World Cup. If Russia is to compete when it welcomes the world, Capello says it must work on developing a new generation of talented players to replace an aging squad. ""They need to prepare the under-21s, under-20s to find new players,"" said the former AC Milan and Real Madrid coach. ""I need to speak with the managers. We need to put some young players in the first team. This is the problem. ""We've got seven foreign players every game, and four Russian players. If one of the best players is injured, we lose a lot. ""But I always think positive, and I hope we will be the surprise in Brazil.""","Fabio Capello says Russia should not be banned from the 2014 World Cup .

"(CNN) -- Mara Urshel had seen enough heartache to fill her 35,000-square-foot Manhattan bridal salon, Kleinfeld. ""Wedding dress sample sizes are all size 10,"" says Urshel, explaining that plus-sized brides previously could not try on gowns but could only look at them being modeled. ""But a bride is a bride is a bride, no matter what. She shouldn't have to be destroyed because some other woman has to try on dresses so she can decide how she wants to look on her big day."" That is why, six years ago, Urshel decided that Kleinfeld -- now known for being the store showcased in TLC's ""Say Yes to the Dress"" and ""SYTTD: Big Bliss"" -- would stock plus-size dress samples, which brides could order up to a size 32. ""We give the bride whatever she wants,"" says Urshel. ""She is the customer."" Oh, for a world in which that were true for the rest of us, says Gwen DeVoe, the executive producer of the just- completed Sonsi Full-Figured Fashion Week in New York. Still in its infancy, FFW was created on the premise that plus-sized women are generally ignored by American designers, every trendy mall store, all the glossy magazines -- and they're tired of it. ""Let's call it frustrated,"" said DeVoe. DeVoe has not appointed herself the spokesperson for all plus-sized women in America, but she could. Her goal three years ago in putting together FFW was to get fashion designers and their customers together because she just didn't think the people who are paid to do that in this country were doing it very well. She thinks the designers and retailers don't get it. She thinks they don't respect the plus-sized customer. Furthermore, she thinks they are leaving gobs of big-girl cash on the table. ""They say we don't spend money on clothes? That's bananas,"" DeVoe says. ""We're a very loyal customer. But we don't buy the magazines because we don't see ourselves in them. We don't go to their shows because we aren't invited -- and by the way, neither are you."" FFW's Saturday night finale brought together 1,000 of those previously uninvited designer-friendly customers who are ready to buy. Showcasing more than 25 designers, the event was what DeVoe had imagined -- a toast to the curvy figure, proof that women can eschew the cultural norm of model-thinness and wear the best clothes and be worthy of Italian Vogue. The fact that the show looked like a million and could rake in likewise was not to be lost in the shuffle of any such runway extravaganza either. DeVoe says designers -- she cites Jean Paul Gautier -- think runways are about fantasy and ""nobody fantasizes about being fat."" ""I just want to look good in clothes. How about you?"" By the numbers . Despite DeVoe's protestations, only 17% of women's apparel dollar was spent last year on plus-sized clothing, according to Marshall Cohen, chief retail analyst for the NPD Group. This happened even though plus-sized women had 28% of the purchasing power, he said. It makes you wonder about the higher math. The average-sized woman in America is either a 14 or 16 -- depending on who you ask and what style she's got on (and sometimes which afternoon she's trying it on). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, she weighs 164.7 pounds. Now consider this: Most designers and some mall stores call a size 14 a plus-size. The United States is continuing to fill up with those larger-than-size-14s. Remember those numbers out of the CDC that say that two out of three Americans are overweight or obese and in need of a good workout? And yet with only 17% of the market dollar contributed, plus-sized women still plunked in more than $17.5 billion in sales in the 12 months ending in April 2011. So what we have is a potentially huge -- and getting bigger -- market for plus-sized fashion. According to Cohen, that market came close to $18 billion in the April 2009 to April 2010 buying season, but it backed away in the season ending April 2011. That's because when times got hard for retailers, the first product line they cut was, yes, the plus-sized line. Again, why the disrespect? Cohen says one reason is there's the perception, backed some by reality, that a part of the larger-sized market is not fashion-centric, ""not into clothes."" And, two, there is simply not enough product available for them to spend money on. ""If you don't give them more than 10% of the floor space of available retail floor space, "" he asked, ""what do you expect?"" Squeezed on to the Internet . They could go online. Well, yes. The big-name retailers openly invite them to by not actually carrying anything above, in some cases, a size 14. Gap, Old Navy, Ann Taylor, H&M and Banana Republic sell their plus sizes exclusively online. When times got tough for some retailers, like Liz Claiborne, their plus-sized line, like Elisabeth, was dropped altogether in 2009. (Gap, which owns its eponymous brand, Old Navy and Banana Republic, did not respond to a request for comment from CNN.com. Liz Claiborne Inc. declined comment.) Sonsi, a recent addition to the online world, just opened a year ago to the plus-sized customer. It has gathered 380 plus-sized retailers together in one place to make shopping easier for the e-consumer. Some of those outlets are the usual suspects -- like Lane Bryant and Fashion Bug -- but most are mom-and-pop start-ups that saw the need and filled it. Spokesperson Jill Hutchinson says the reaction from most of the people who find the website is ""where have you been all my life?"" Sonsi.com is also crafted as a social commerce site that merged fashion retail with magazine-style content and social networking, specifically for full-figured women who have loved the outlet as a way to talk about their lives. Some plus-sized women like shopping online. But as bloggers, customer complaint lines and retail analysts illustrate, it's not for larger women who: . • Want to try on the clothes before they buy them. • Want to cash in on sales. • Want to avoid shipping costs . • Believe they are being excluded from the store because the stores doesn't want fat people in there ruining the experience for the skinny people. Even in department stores, the concerns of the plus-sized woman aren't considered, said Cohen of the trend-tracking NPD Group. The dressing rooms aren't big enough, and some stores have gang dressing rooms, which are tough for those with acute body awareness issues anyway. ""Women don't want their self-esteem bashed when they walk into a department store,"" said Emme, the first plus-sized supermodel, head of emmenation.com and now an actress in New York. ""I don't think we're talking about anorexics or those morbidly obese. We're talking about what's real. The ""size-14 on top and size-16 on bottom"" mother and entrepreneur says: ""Look. We eat right. We exercise when we can. We take care of our kids. We want to look good. We aren't built like teenagers. Just once I'd like to see us take a day and not buy anything from a certain segment of stores and then they'd see how much buying power we have."" Point of view, sensibility and expertise . Some ask what is the problem? Surely the industry has seen the numbers? Robin Givhan, the Pulitzer Prize-winning fashion writer for Newsweek and The Daily Beast, is certain they have. ""High-end designers should be making size 14s. That's lunacy if they're not. But as the population as a whole has gotten bigger, the idealized model has gotten smaller. It's a way of denoting its rarefied status and exclusivity, in a sad way it reinforces the status of thinness."" She tells the story of when designer Tracy Reese opened up a store in Manhattan and stocked it full of all the standard sizes and was surprised to find that what size Reese ran out of first was Os and 2s. That is who the designer customer is. Givhan says that back in the 1990s, when Cindy Crawford ruled the runways, the ravishing brunette supermodel was a size 6. There were women out there with with breasts and thighs just like hers; they were not malnourished waifs. Givhan knows that size 6 is not size 16, but says maybe one day the cycle away from size 0s and 2s on the runway can come back around to what ""normal"" women wear. ""How big is too big? The average person knows the difference between voluptuous and obese. Do I think they should be hacking off their biggest customer base? No. But how much of their brand identification is based on their idealized customer? It's not just high-end designers who have idealized customers either. That's what brands are. It's why customers are drawn to them in the first place."" Then what's the answer for the disrespected and designed-disaffected on all price points on the fashion budget? Says Givhan: Get new designers who ""get"" that market. Right now, she says, the plus-sized market is asking for designers to increase its regular-sized proportions when maybe those designers just don't get what makes a plus-sized dress or skirt or blouse great. ""It's about point of view, sensibility and expertise,"" she says. You don't want a sportswear designer making your Oscar gown, she pointed out. ""The fit is wrong."" Cohen agrees, but adds: ""This is a loyal audience. They like where they've bought before, but once they've found you, they will stay with you. If you decide to start to get into that market and haven't been, good luck to you. You're going to have to earn your stripes. ""But it will be worth it. The market is there.""","Full-Figure Fashion Week producer says many designers diss big women .

"(CNN) -- [Breaking news update, Sunday, 3:20 a.m.] . People were crying out for help from underneath debris early Sunday after a landslide in Washington state, said City of Arlington fire Capt. Brandon Asher. Rescuers are trying to forge through the wreckage to get to them. [Original story, Saturday, 11:49 pm.] . 3 killed, 3 critically injured in Washington state landslide . (CNN) -- A devastating landslide Saturday killed three people, cut off a small town and a river and prompted an evacuation notice for fear of a potentially ""catastrophic flood event,"" authorities in Washington state said. The Snohomish County Sheriff's Office said, in addition to those dead, seven adults and a 6-month-old boy were rescued and sent to local hospitals. One of those hospitals, Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, reported that five patients had been airlifted there and were in its care. Three of those -- including the baby, a 58-year-old man and an 81-year-old man -- were in critical condition Saturday night, according to spokeswoman Susan Gregg. At least six houses were destroyed in the landslide, though the sheriff's office noted they are still assessing exactly how many structures have been affected. The first reports of the landslide came in around 10:45 a.m. (1:45 p.m. ET) along State Road 530, the sheriff's office said. Photos provided by the Washington State Patrol show floodwaters and sprawling debris covering a rural patch of that two-lane road, framed by woodlands and snow-capped mountains. CNN first learned of the landslide via Twitter. Groundwater saturation tied to heavy rainfall in the area over the past month was blamed for the landslide, which authorities say measured at least 45 yards wide. Because it blocked SR 530, the landslide cut off Darrington, a town of about 1,350 people located 75 miles northeast of Seattle and within close proximity to Round Mountain, Whitehorse Mountain and White Chuck Mountain. Part of the Stillaguamish River also was blocked. Residents got reverse 911 calls warning them of ""flooding upstream from the slide, as well as the possibility of a downstream flooding should there be a catastrophic breach by the river,"" said Shari Ireton, a sheriff's spokeswoman. The county later said ""we strongly recommend"" that those living in the north fork of the Stillaguamish River flood plain, from Oso to Stanwood, to ""evacuate your home immediately."" ""We are working on establishing shelters for those who have nowhere to go,"" county spokeswoman Rebecca Hover said in a statement. ""Until then, people should get to higher ground as soon as possible. ""Nightfall is approaching, and we do not want to take any chances."" Gov. Jay Inslee expressed dismay later Saturday about the ""tragedy in Oso,"" the remote community of about 180 people 15 miles west of Darrington. ""On behalf of all Washingtonians, my condolences to the families who lost loved ones in (the) mudslide today,"" Inslee tweeted. A number of agencies have responded, including the state transportation and emergency management departments, the U.S. Navy and fire departments across Snohomish County. Upon arriving at the scene, firefighters and state troopers heard calls for help, trooper Mark Francis said. The Snohomish sheriff warned people to stay clear of trestles or bridges or anywhere near the Stillaguamish River downstream of the slide. ""Water could break through at any moment,"" the sheriff's office tweeted. CNN's Michael Martinez and AnneClaire Stapleton contributed to this report.","NEW: 5 airlifted to one Seattle hospital, including a baby and 2 men in critical condition .

"(CNN) -- When one of his sparring partners said he was getting married, Manny Pacquiao helped the newlyweds buy a house. When the poor province in which he grew up in the Philippines needed a hospital, he ponied up some of the money for one. When his country had elections, Pacquiao ran twice for and finally won a post in congress. He helped start one program to give cattle to farmers and another to give small motors to fishermen for their boats. No doubt, the boxing champ has a soft heart. Except for one man, apparently: his opponent in Saturday night's HBO pay-per-view fight, Juan Manuel Marquez. They have fought twice before. After fighting to a draw in the first match, Pacquiao won by split-decision in the second. Marquez insists he won both fights. It's not unusual for a boxer to think he won a close match, but after a fight against Michael Katsidis last year, Marquez wore a shirt that said on the front, ""Marquez beat Pacquiao twice!!"" and on the back it said, ""Pacquiao, Your (sic) Next."" Those close to Pacquiao say the taunt angered him. Some say he has prepared for this fight with an intensity they haven't seen from him before. Asked by reporters last week about the animosity, the boxer said: . ""I have worked really hard for this fight ... and made a lot of sacrifices for this training camp,"" said the soft-spoken Pacquiao in halting English. ""If a knockout comes, that is a bonus for the hard work. I just wanted to make sure I was prepared 100% for this fight."" But trainer Freddie Roach admits that the T-shirt gave Pacquiao, rated by Ring Magazine as the best fighter in the world regardless of weight, an ""extra spark."" Pacquiao usually spars at 50% intensity, leaving some energy for the fight, said Roach. This time, during an extended 10-week training camp, the ""Pacman"" has upped it to at least 70%. During a recent talk with one of his sparring partners after a workout, the 144-pound Pacquiao exclaimed, ""I want this fight! I want this fight."" And earlier this week Pacquiao said Marquez had disrespected him and he was out to prove who was better, not for a huge payday. Pacquiao, 33, will earn many millions for this fight against Marquez, an often overlooked superstar who is rated by Ring as the fifth-best fighter pound-for-pound. Depending on pay-per-view sales Pacquiao will make more than $30 million. (The fight, for Pacquiao's welterweight title, will be televised on HBO PPV, which like CNN is owned by Time Warner.) Pacquiao's success in the ring and his generosity have made him a national icon. ""He came from extreme poverty,"" Bong Constantino, mayor of Malungon, told CNN's Talk Asia in 2009. ""Now that he has everything in life he still practices that extreme humbleness in his heart. That's why he is so loved by our people here."" When he was young, Pacquiao sold candy and cigarettes on the streets. There were days he didn't make enough to eat. At 14, he ran away -- stowed away, actually -- to Manila to help earn more money for his siblings and single mother. At first he was a laborer, but he soon learned he could earn 100 pesos (a few U.S. dollars) fighting unsanctioned bouts -- the kind where the losers occasionally died. Motivated by the death of a friend, Pacquiao eventually succeeded in turning pro. He won his first 11 fights, televised on Friday nights, making him a national celebrity. But the big money was in the United States, and eventually with a 33-2 record and a super-bantamweight (122 pounds) title, he moved to America in 2001 at age 22. He and his manager flew to San Francisco and took a bus to Los Angeles where someone directed them to the Wild Card Boxing Club in Hollywood. That's where Pacquiao met boxing-trainer extraordinaire Roach. The two are a strong team, said long-time trainer Emanuel Steward, who will serve as an analyst for the TV broadcast. ""There is an unbelievable chemistry there,"" Steward said. ""They really seem to understand each other. Freddie has done a great job with him."" That includes with letting Pacquiao be a free spirit when he's not boxing. You would think Roach would be upset with all the things Pacquiao does outside the ring -- politician, game show host, businessman, pitchman -- but the trainer embraces it. ""I like the separation,"" Roach said. ""He doesn't keep his mind on the fight all the time. When he gets in the ring, it's nothing but boxing. But if he wants to go on Jimmy Kimmel, if he wants to go sing, I have no problem with that. ...That's Manny Pacquiao."" Many Americans know of Pacquiao from the ring or his Hewlett-Packard commercials or his appearances singing on late night TV. But don't assume that just because he is the pound-for-pound best fighter that he'll easily handle Marquez, the WBC and WBA lightweight champion. ""Out of the 24 rounds they fought he's ahead by one point,"" Steward said. ""Manny -- sometimes when he goes forward he's so excited, he almost runs in and he gets his legs crossed up. And Marquez catches him after that when Pacquiao is off balance."" Steward said Roach has made Pacquiao a better fighter, helping him improve his lead right hand. That combined with the fact that Pacquiao throws amazingly quick punches from ""so many weird angles"" leads Steward to predict a Pacquiao victory. Although he would be a very nervous bettor, he said, if he were to lay money down. After the fight, it'll be back to work in congress for Pacquiao. It'll be every bit the battle as a fight in the ring, he said. Philippine politics are rife with corruption, he told CNN's Piers Morgan. ""That's what I am trying to do, to change politics in the Philippines,"" he said in an interview to be broadcast Friday night. ""I want (to show) to them that I am the good example, to serve honestly.""","Manny Pacquiao fights Juan Manuel Marquez for the third time on Saturday night .
The Filipino boxer fled his impoverished roots, took up boxing to make money for family .
Now he shares his fortune with others, helping to buy stuff for people in need .

"(CNN) -- Duwon Steven Clark is standing on the white rock patio, just to the right of the now-silent cannons of Ghana's Cape Coast Castle, trying to get himself around a memory he never had. Clark, a 21-year old Haitian-American student at Florida A&M University, came to Cape Coast to find his great ancestors, men and maybe women whose names he doesn't, and likely, won't ever know. What he found here was so much better, and so much worse. ""I just took a quick minute to look at the water crashing up against this castle,"" he says. ""It's just overwhelming."" Clark stares out at the sea, as if trying to figure the route the slave ships carrying his ancestors sailed from the shores of West Africa to Haiti, to the ""New World."" He is in Ghana studying abroad at the University of Ghana, trying, he tells me, ""to get that African experience, that experience of being home and being connected and learning about where I came from and where my ancestors came from."" Below his feet and all around him, he is finding diabolical answers. Tortuous voyage . Our guide tells us that between the late 17th and early 19th centuries, some three million West African slaves -- many traded to the British by African tribes -- were shipped out to the Americas from this ironically picturesque, fading white prison. Four in 10 never survived the tortuous transoceanic voyage, crammed barely alive in the hull below the deck. Here one learns, just surviving to get on board was a victory of the human spirit. Our guide takes our small group from the sunny bright patio into the tunnel that leads to the men's dungeons. In one dungeon, Clark studies the thick stone walls and looks toward the two tiny windows high up near the ceiling at the end of the room. He hears each word the guide says, grabs the words as they hang in the musty air: ""They put about 1,000 men at a time in this room, no light. Many went blind. They had to go on the floor, and live in it."" There's only a small channel running through the center of the room, their sewer. ""See this patch on the floor here?"" our guide says. ""This is what's left of human excrement, 300 years-old. ""This is what they lived in, died in."" The average stay was two to six months. Clark tells me, ""1,000 men. How did they lie down to sleep? How could they bear the smell?"" The guide says: ""Some slept sitting, others in rows, their heads between the legs of their fellows. After a while, they had no senses anymore. They were chattel."" Clark sees a lot in the dungeon's darkness. ""I was just standing there in the dungeon room,"" he says, ""and I was thinking, how many songs were sung to get them through the night? How many tears fell? How many solemn prayers were enough?"" The 'lucky ones' Prayers indeed. The British built their church directly above the men's dungeons. Our guide says the slaves likely could hear the Sunday prayers. In the women's dungeons, much smaller, the guide tells us, some 400 female slaves were kept. ""Can anyone tell me why they had women slaves?"" he asks. Clark listens, the words hang, suspended across centuries. The guide: ""Breeding. Slave buyers in the Americas wanted to make sure their slaves could produce more slaves, so they sent some women too."" A few women became the ""lucky ones."" When the castle's commander wanted companionship, the soldiers would march the women into the courtyard, and from a walkway above, the commander would pick one out. She was washed and brought to him. If she got pregnant, she was sent to a house in town and taken care of, and her mulatto child was sent to school and treated well. The words come slowly to Clark. ""So the ""lucky ones,"" he pauses, taking a breath of repulsed recognition. ""Those were the ones who were raped. They were the ""lucky ones."" Later, I realize this experience is so different for Clark than it is for most tourists, who are shocked by the barbarity but ultimately, one step removed. For them, it is history. But for Clark, it is personal. ""I can't feel disconnected,"" he explains. ""These are the people you heard stories about, the people who came through your grandmother, your great grandfather, your great uncles -- these are the people who I came through."" Condemned cell . We cross the patio and walk into another room, small, tight, the walls made of thick stone, no windows. The guide closes the door and all light disappears. A few people quickly become uncomfortable. After a few seconds, he opens the door, and light pours back in. He explains this is the ""Condemned Cell,"" where they put slaves who resisted. He says they threw them in here, behind three locked doors, and just left them, with no food, no water, no ventilation. On the floor and lower walls, you can see scratch marks. Clark thinks of those slaves, their last scrawls of hope and life, vanishing in the darkness, as they brutally died. Clark says he feels helpless, angry. He wants to do something, anything, but time is the insurmountable obstacle. ""I wonder what I could have done to help that person make it through the night,"" he says, ""to help him through that moment when he felt it was so necessary to scrape the ground."" And lastly, we walk toward the infamous door, the ""Door of No Return."" This is the doorway where slaves were led, to be loaded on to ships, their last moments in their native land. As we walk toward the Door down the corridor, the guide points off to the right, to a deep tunnel where the slaves were walked. He explains they never came to the surface, instead led through tunnels from the dungeons to the sea. Clark steps through the Door and looks out. Our guide explains, in those days, the water came right up to the door. Now it has receded several dozen meters. But for Clark, the water, the reality, is still right at his feet. 'So much anger' I asked him what he would say to those who ran this place. He looks down, seems to shake slightly. ""Anger, just so much anger. But I would have so many questions why. No religion, no amount of wealth, nothing can amount or perpetuate or give you that confidence or okay to think that it's okay to do this to another human being. I would just want to know why."" I asked him what he would say to his ancestors, who survived this place and the journey by ship to live in the Americas as slaves, still strong enough there to make a family, to give him life centuries later. ""I would say, hold on. What you're going through is not going to last long."" Clark named American civil rights leaders Dr. Martin Luther King Junior and Malcolm X, Congolese independence leader Patrice Lumumba, and Ghana's first president Kwame Nkrumah. ""It's up to us to carry on the legacy of those who came after our ancestors."" Unfinished story . For Clark, Cape Coast, and other slave forts like it up and down what they used to call the ""Gold Coast,"" is a story that is not finished. It is making him something better. ""Being here today is going to enable me to step into those lanes I was afraid to step into before, and just walk proud, to not be afraid to go after those things that I hope for and to stand for those rights I dream of."" He says he owes that to his ancestors who survived, and that it is a way of telling those who ran this place -- they did not win. Act of liberation . For Clark, what happened here centuries ago, is very much a part of the present. Clark is angry, yes, but this visit is also an act of liberation. In the early 2000s, the bones of two African slaves were repatriated from their U.S. graves to Cape Coast Castle. They were carried back from the beach through the Door of No Return. Our guide says, on that day, the horrific spell was finally broken. A sign over the door as one walks back through now says simply, ""Door of Return."" Clark walks back through it too. ""Just make sure whatever you're doing is for the right, for the just, and it's always positive,"" he says. He tells me he leaves with a new purpose: To walk back through the Door, to carry his ancestors back through it, every day of his life. The International Center for Journalists and the Media Foundation for West Africa sponsored David Gurien's reporting trip to Ghana.","Haitian American Duwon Steven Clark returned to Ghana in search of his ancestors .

"(EW) -- If ""The Wedding Singer"" is the ""Annie Hall"" of Adam Sandler movies, then ""Blended"" is his ""Anything Else."" Sandler and Drew Barrymore unite for a third time, after ""50 First Dates,"" but like an unhappy old married couple staring at the clock, they ran out of fresh and meaningful things to say years ago. Sandler plays a Dick's Sporting Goods employee named Jim who lost his wife to cancer and hasn't a clue how to raise his three daughters. The eldest, for example, is named Hilary (Bella Thorne) but Jim calls her Larry â€” presumably because she's good at basketball and has Larry Bird's 1979 hairstyle. 'The Giver' character posters: The eyes have it . Barrymore plays Lauren, a working single mom with two holy terror sons, one of whom is pulsating with puberty and a pornography obsession. Jim and Lauren get set up on a disastrous blind date, and both part ways hoping to never see the other again. But before you can say, ""Hey guys, it's Adam. I convinced a studio to finance our group vacation to South Africa as long as we make a movie with oodles of product placement,"" both families are thrust together at a luxurious resort that specializes in blended and nontraditional-family vacations. How and why? Does it really matter? Once in South Africa, mutual loathing turns to mutual respect, with Lauren giving Hilary a makeover and Jim helping Lauren's boys with sports. When Lauren discovers Jim's sensitive soul, and Jim sees Lauren in a sexy black dress ... well, I don't want to ruin the ending for you! 'Godzilla': The secrets behind the roar . ""Blended"" is dotted with familiar faces from previous Sandler comedies and a few hammy celebrity cameos, but only Kevin Nealon -- who plays a middle-aged dad enamored with his buxom new bimbo -- delivers any solid laughs. (Poor Joel McHale didn't even get to visit Africa for the lackluster assignment of playing Lauren's douche-y ex, whose one-line character description must've been, ""Craig Kilborn in 'Old School.'"") Though he's starring in promising upcoming films from directors Tom McCarthy and Jason Reitman, Sandler still seems shackled with the golden handcuffs of making easy, lucrative comedies, from ""Click"" to ""Bedtime Stories"" to ""Grown Ups.""

"Seoul (CNN) -- President Barack Obama arrives in South Korea on Friday looking to bolster ties with an ally at a moment when it's reeling from a ferry disaster that killed 180 people at last count. Obama, as he often does at home as ""consoler-in-chief,"" will offer support to survivors and victims' families as he pauses from the policy and diplomatic demands of his week-long trip to Asia. Last week, Obama called the disaster ""heartbreaking,"" a gesture that was noted and well received within the government in Seoul. The capsizing of the ferry Sewol carrying almost 500 people, including high school students on a field trip, has occupied most of South Korean President Park Guen-hye's time over the past week. Park has confronted outcry from South Koreans who want answers on why the ferry turned over. A criminal investigation is underway. The ferry disaster will no doubt overshadow some part the original intent of Obama's visit — to reinforce ties with a strong U.S. ally in the increasingly important Asia-Pacific region. United front against North Korea . Both countries want to display a united front against North Korea, which in recent days has stepped up activity at its main nuclear test site — possibly in preparation for another underground blast. The North Korean Foreign Ministry this week described Obama's trip to Seoul as ""a reactionary and dangerous one as it is aimed to escalate confrontation and bring dark clouds of a nuclear arms race to hang over this unstable region."" Obama, speaking Thursday, called on North Korea ""to start changing your behavior."" ""They are the most isolated country in the world. They are subject to more international sanctions and international condemnation than any country in the world. As a consequence, their people suffer as much as any peoples in the world,"" he said. Aims to reassure Pacific allies . Obama headed to Seoul from Tokyo, where a formal state visit — complete with a royal audience and a black-tie dinner — was meant to exhibit strong ties between Japan and the United States. White House officials hope the week-long trip to Asia will reassure Pacific allies the U.S. remains committed to turning its foreign policy focus to them. But he has few tangible ""deliverables"" to take home. In Tokyo at a news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Obama was pressed on whether he would use military force to defend an obscure set of islands controlled by Japan that are at the heart of a heated regional dispute with China. He said the U.S. security pact with Japan does extend to the islands -- known as Diaoyu to the Chinese -- and insisted his implicit offer to defend them against any Chinese incursion did not amount to drawing a red line around the contested land. ""The treaty between the U.S. and Japan preceded my birth, so this isn't a red line that I'm drawing,"" Obama said. ""There's no shift in position, no red line. Were simply applying the treaty."" Obama plays soccer with robot . The group of islands and rocks jutting out of the ocean is tiny and uninhabited. But the long-standing dispute over them has sent tempers flaring in Beijing and Tokyo, especially in recent years. The area around them in the South China Sea between Taiwan and Okinawa is believed to be rich in oil resources. Senkaku is administered by the Japanese, but the Chinese claim they are the rightful owners. The possibility of a war over the islands has been a thorn in the side of the United States, which says it is obligated by the common security agreement to back Japan. Obama repeatedly urged that Japan and China seek a peaceful resolution through dialogue. A pivot to Russia and Syria . In his second term, Obama has had limited success in issuing ultimatums in the hopes of halting aggression from nations like Russia and Syria. But he seized on the line of questioning over the islands to defend his handling of the crisis in Ukraine and Syria's bloody civil war. Warning a new round of sanctions against Russia are ""teed up,"" the President said he doubts Moscow will honor its commitment last week in Geneva to deescalate tensions in eastern Ukraine. ""Do I think they are going to do that? So far, the evidence doesn't make me hopeful,"" Obama said at the news conference, acknowledging Russia has yet to reverse course in the face of mounting economic pressure. But on Syria, Obama said his policy of diplomacy first had a direct effect on the removal of 87% of that country's chemical weapons stockpiles. ""The fact that we didn't have to fire a missile to get that accomplished is not a failure to uphold those international norms -- it's a success,"" Obama said. Asked if he was confident with Obama's assurances on Japan's security, Abe pointed to Obama's leadership in rallying the G-7 economic powers to apply sanctions on Russia. The missing plane . Seoul is the first of two stops on Obama's tour where citizens are coming to grips with major transportation disasters — on Saturday Obama flies to Malaysia, where government officials continue to search in vain for the Malaysian Airlines jetliner that disappeared more than a month ago. Those officials have come under withering censure, accused of botching the search and keeping family members of those on board in the dark. So far the White House has avoided faulting Malaysian leaders for the efforts, instead highlighting the U.S. efforts to help locate the plane. Obama has spoken publicly about the missing plane only once, during an interview in mid-March, offering U.S. assets to help in the search.

"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (CNN) -- A Malaysia Airlines flight to South Korea made an emergency landing in Hong Kong early Monday after its main electrical generator stopped working, the airline said. The plane, an Airbus A330-300, landed in Hong Kong safely around 3 a.m., Malaysia Airlines said, and the 271 passengers on board have been transferred onto flights with other airlines. The reason for the diversion of Malaysia Airlines Flight 066 was ""an inoperative aircraft generator, which supplies normal electrical power,"" the company said. Electrical power continued to be supplied by the plane's auxiliary power unit, it said. Malaysia Airlines is in the international spotlight following the disappearance more than two weeks ago of one of its passenger jets with 239 people on board. That plane, Flight 370, was on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when it vanished over Southeast Asia. The flight that was diverted Monday set off from Kuala Lumpur at 11:37 p.m. Sunday and was scheduled to arrive at 6:50 a.m. the next day at Incheon International Airport, the main airport serving the South Korean capital, Seoul. Hong Kong airport said it received a call at 2:30 a.m. alerting it of the flight's urgent change of course and placed local teams on standby. The plane made its emergency landing without any problems about half an hour later. The scheduled return flight from Incheon to Kuala Lumpur has been canceled, Malaysia Airlines said, and passengers have been placed on other flights. CNN's Sarita Harilela reported from Kuala Lumpur, and Jethro Mullen wrote this report from Hong Kong. CNN's Licia Yee contributed to this report.","The plane's electrical generator stopped working, the airline says .

"(CNN) -- After becoming the first team to defend the European Championships, adding a second continental title to the World Cup won in 2010, many observers have been quick to label Spain the greatest team in the history of international football. An emphatic 4-0 thrashing of Italy, the biggest margin of victory ever seen in a world or European final, continued a remarkable run which has seen Spain not concede a goal in a knockout match since the great Zinedine Zidane found the back of their net for France at the 2006 World Cup. Comparisons are now being drawn with teams like the Pele-inspired Brazil of the 1970 World Cup, which won six games at the tournament to become three-time world champions -- averaging 3.2 goals per game. So how do Spain, led by the ""illustrious"" Vicente del Bosque and built around the Barcelona-bred midfield axis of Xavi and Andres Iniesta, stack up against the ""selecao"" of 42 years ago, which featured icons like Pele, Jairzinho and Tostao? ""A team who win back-to-back European titles, and a World Cup in the middle, have a very strong claim to being the best ever,"" said World Soccer contributor and Brazilian football journalist Fernando Duarte. ""My pinch of salt would be the Brazil 1970 side, how many chances would they have had to play big tournaments? The South American Championship (now the Copa America) was always poorly organized."" La Roja's recent domination of international football has been underlined by goalkeeper and captain Iker Casillas, who, after Sunday's final in Kiev, became the first player to record 100 wins in international football -- accumulated over 137 matches. Blog: Spain make compelling case as best team ever . The Real Madrid goalkeeper's importance to his country was apparent as Spain conceded just one goal en route to retaining their European crown -- Antonio di Natale's strike for Italy when the two teams drew 1-1 in their opening Group C match. In contrast Mario Zagallo's samba stars shipped seven goals in just six games in Mexico in 1970. ""Spain have arguably one of the best goalkeepers to grace this world,"" said Duarte. ""Iker Casillas is unbelievably good. He's so good people now presume Spain has always produced good goalkeepers. ""Until the mid-1980s, Brazil were known for producing dodgy goalkeepers. Felix, the goalkeeper in 1970, was bad. Even by the standards of Brazilians, people used to say he wasn't the right guy."" But the success of Zagallo's team was not built on defense. Instead it was made possible through an irrepressible attack which, in powerful forward Jairzinho, boasted one of only three players to have scored in every match of a World Cup tournament. Jairzinho's goals, combined with the four scored by Pele and three from Rivelino, helped Brazil amass 19 in six World Cup matches, beating reigning champions England along the way. ""Jairzinho is a hero,"" said Duarte. ""He is like the typical striker every European team would love to have. That guy was like a bulldozer. ""They had Pele, in his swansong after two very mediocre World Cups in 1962 and 1966. They were a machine, a very efficient team. ""They could play the ball, they could do a lot of trickery. But on the other hand, they appealed to the Europeans because of the lack of 'samba' or dribbling. They were pretty much a European team."" Duarte also points to the physical prowess of Zagallo's 11, who helped shatter traditional preconceptions regarding the strength and fitness of South American players -- culminating in a thumping 4-1 win over Italy in the 1970 final. ""Brazil showed up in Mexico City with a bunch of horses,"" explained Duarte. ""Clearly they could play, but they were also fit. ""Italy beat West Germany in the semifinal and arrived in the final against Brazil tired, they were steamrollered by the Brazilians. Every second half in that competition, Brazil murdered everybody else."" The lasting appeal of this Brazil team, Duarte believes, is also linked to technology which allowed the 1970 World Cup to be beamed around the globe in color -- allowing viewers a first glimpse of the iconic yellow shirt. ""It was the first global World Cup. People sat in front of the television and watched it properly. ""No one remembers 1962 and outside of Europe people don't really remember 1966. It was a World Cup where TV technology was pretty much together. It was easier for people to see it."" Iniesta 'symbolized Euro 2012 success' Taking into account all of the statistics, considering Spain's domineering tiki taka possession-based style and Brazil's ""jogo bonito,"" which team will history remember as the better? ""I would love to see them play against each other,"" said Duarte. ""As a dynasty, Spain now are better. That Brazilian team was nothing like the team of four years earlier. The Spanish team has been largely the same since 2008. ""Head-to-head, I think some differences have to be observed. Spain doesn't have a Pele, they certainly don't have a Carlos Alberto (the captain who scored the iconic fourth goal in the 1970 final -- widely regarded as the finest in history)."" The next World Cup will be hosted by Brazil, bringing back memories of when the South Americans held the tournament in 1950, missing out on a first world crown by losing in the final match to Uruguay. ""The pressure of playing at home will be horrendous,"" explained Duarte. ""Even in a meaningless match, if Brazil don't score in the first five minutes the crowd start booing. Blog: Are Spain boring? ""South American champions Santos played Barcelona (of Spain) in the Club World Cup final last year, and that's one of the things which has Brazil scared. ""Santos were trounced and that sent shockwaves around Brazil. These guys were the basis of the Spanish team, and they just made fools of the best team in South America."" So is there any hope of Brazil lifting the World Cup trophy for a sixth time at a rebuilt Maracana stadium in two years' time? ""They have some very decent players emerging. Striker Neymar is a genius, you have players like attacking midfielder Ganso and playmaker Oscar,"" Duarte said. ""I am sure they will have a very good team in 2014. If you asked me right now, 'Will Brazil win the World Cup?' my answer is no. Can Brazil win it? Yes, if things change.""","Many observers have labeled Spain the greatest team in the history of the game .
Spain have won three major successive international tournaments.
Brazil's 1970 World Cup winning team won all six games in Mexico .

"(CNN) -- A Belgian football agent has stepped up his fight to prevent the sport's lawmakers from limiting the spending power of clubs, suggesting teams should be allowed to control their own finances if they pay a ""luxury tax."" Daniel Striani is questioning the legality of the Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules implemented by UEFA, European football's governing body. Striani teamed up with Jean-Louis Dupont -- the lawyer who in 1995 helped change European law and the freedom of football transfers in the landmark Bosman case -- to lodge a complaint with the European Commission in May. Now they have launched legal action in the Court of First Instance in Brussels, asking for it to ""judge on alleged infringements of both EU competition law and the right to free movement (of workers, services and capital)."" The duo are challenging UEFA's ""break-even"" rule, which dictates a football team cannot spend beyond its means. The regulation is supposed to ensure that bigger clubs do not gain an advantage by operating under huge debt guaranteed by wealthy owners. Striani claims the rule is illegal under European Union law as it is ""disproportionate."" He is suggesting that overspending should be allowed with certain conditions, such as if teams agree to pay a ""luxury tax"" or if there is a change in how revenue is shared in UEFA club competitions. ""This latest legal process is supported by a growing body of economic and legal opinion which argues the UEFA rule is ineffective, illegal and disproportionate given alternative measures available,"" read a statement released to CNN by Striani's publicist on Thursday. The European Commission process is ongoing, with a ruling expected in 2014. Dupont was part of the legal team which represented Belgian player Jean-Marc Bosman, whose successful battle to switch clubs at the end of his contract with Standard Liege changed the face of the football transfer market. Players are now allowed to move on free transfers when their deals with clubs expire. Striani works primarily with young, up-and-coming players. His two most high-profile clients are Yohan Benalouane at Parma in Italy and Denis Odoi at Belgian club Anderlecht. Malaga became the first major team to fall foul of FFP after UEFA claimed the club owed wages to players and had debts with other football sides as well as the Spanish tax authorities. UEFA hit the European Champions League quarterfinalists with a two-season ban from continental competition, which was later reduced to one season. The Spanish club's appeal against that punishment, which included a $400,000 fine, was rejected by the Court of Arbitration for Sport this month.","A Belgian football agent has stepped up his legal challenge against UEFA .

"Caracas, Venezuela (CNN) -- Venezuelan lawmakers have given President Nicolas Maduro special decree powers to fight an ""economic war,"" but the shape that fight will take is uncertain. Maduro has promised to use his new powers -- approved by the National Assembly on Tuesday -- to make sweeping changes to the way the economy is run in the oil-rich, but poorly managed South American nation. Among his priorities, Maduro says, will be to cap profits for businesses at between 15% and 30% and to enforce price controls on an expanding number of goods. Some see this as a movement to a fully socialist model; other see political opportunism. In recent months, Maduro has blamed capitalism for speculation that is driving high rates of inflation and creating widespread shortages of staples. The so-called ""enabling law"" that grants him decree powers could make it easier for him to set price controls, as he did recently to an electronics and appliance chain he accused of price gouging. The result was a run on the Daka chain of stores, as people mobbed to buy deeply discounted electronics in chaotic scenes that included some looting. ""Consumerism is not the path,"" the President said Tuesday. ""We are re-establishing prices so that the people's economic rights are respected, not to consume without control."" The underlying goal of these expanded powers are for Maduro to push a socialist agenda to the point of no return, said Jose Vicente Haro, a Venezuelan constitutional lawyer. ""What we've seen is just a little of what's coming,"" he told CNN en EspaÃ±ol. ""What Nicolas Maduro's primary objective is now is to regulate the profits of all companies that provide services or produce goods."" Those who agree with Haro fear that foreign investment in Venezuela will dry up as the government cuts their profits. But behind the blustery rhetoric, there may be hints at a more pragmatic approach, said David Smilde, a Venezuela expert and senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America. Faced with a difficult transition after the death of President Hugo Chavez, Maduro has adopted the economic war for political purposes, Smilde said. The bloc that supported Chavez has been difficult for Maduro to keep together. By putting a name and a face to the ""enemy,"" as he did by singling out the Daka electronics chain, the President is trying to unite voters behind his party ahead of local elections next month, Smilde said. ""Their idea is to have this carry them through the elections,"" he said. ""I think it's completely political."" Behind the scenes, there are signs that the Venezuelan government is taking a less controversial approach to its economy. To fight a shortage of dollars, Venezuela's state-run oil company announced it will sell $4.5 billion in bonds, for instance. There are also reports that it will try to make up even more ground by selling gold from its reserves. Facing shortages, Venezuela takes over toilet paper factory . Maduro hasn't highlighted these moves the same way he has trumpeted his new decree powers, but they are telling of a more pragmatic approach, Smilde said. The government's short-term goal, Venezuelan analyst John Magdaleno agreed, could be to gain an advantage at the polls. Once the election is over, the government will have to take unpopular steps, such as devaluing its currency, to curb inflation. ""I think it's inevitable that to face the current economic situation the government will have to take some measures that will have a negative impact on the lower classes,"" Magdaleno said. On the streets, some Venezuelans see the economic war that their leader is waging as a necessity, or as a dangerous blank check. ""There's no merchandise, and what's available is expensive,"" said Leonardo Guerrero, who sells fish. He has seen variety falling and costs rising, and would like to see a ""fair price,"" for more products, he said. U.S. expels three Venezuelan diplomats .

"Payerne, Switzerland (CNN) -- With the wingspan of a jumbo jet and a scooter-sized engine, the Solar Impulse is a one of a kind. Thanks to nearly 12,000 solar cells and four electrically-powered propellers, it's the first aircraft in the world that can fly without any fuel -- day or night. The 63-meter wide, 1,600 kilogram plane is already a record breaker, staying in the air for 26 unbroken hours in 2010. But it's about more than just flying, says pilot Andre Borschberg. ""We want to show what can be done with these technologies,"" Borschberg said. ""We can keep our quality of life but reduce our energy consumptions, reduce our dependency on oil and nuclear energy."" The idea for Solar Impulse came from Bertrand Piccard, the first man to travel non-stop around the world in a balloon. ""We almost failed (because of) lack of fuel,"" Piccard said of his epic journey back in 1999. ""At that moment, I made a promise that the next time I would fly around the world it would be with no fuel at all. And that's how the vision of solar impulse was born,"" he said. But it wasn't until he met Borschberg seven years ago that he began to fulfill that promise. With a budget of $134 million at their disposal, the Solar Impulse team have the sponsors and the support to realize their goal of flying around the world without fuel in 2014 -- a first in aviation history. ""Everything we do is new. Each time it's a pioneering step,"" Piccard said. ""When the Wright Brothers did that first flight in 1903, it took 25 years for Charles Lindbergh to cross the Atlantic. He did it alone. (It then took) another 25 years to have 100 passengers flying over the Atlantic."" With fair winds behind them, Piccard and Borschberg are confident that the future of solar flying is bright and that Solar Impulse will soar into the record books, securing their place in aviation history as 21st century pioneers of flight.","The Solar Impulse is a unique aircraft which uses solar energy .

"(CNN) -- The auction hammer is ready to go down on a remarkable collection -- it offers you a once in a lifetime opportunity to sample the fine wines collected by legendary football manager Alex Ferguson. During 26 years at Manchester United, Ferguson raised a glass to many memorable wins and toasted countless vintage performances. Auction house Christie's is selling off part of Ferguson's private collection valued at a mouth-watering $5 million, with bidding set to open on nearly 500 lots -- roughly 5,000 bottles -- across three auctions running between May 24 and June 23 in London and Hong Kong as well as online. ""My interest in wine began during a scouting trip in France and, over time, my enjoyment of discovery and collecting grew,"" Ferguson, who retired in May 2013 after guiding United to 13 English Premier League titles and two European Cups, said in a statement. ""The importance of collecting wine was that it served as a distraction and gave me a balance in my life that helped me in dealing with the intensity and demands required of me as the manager of Manchester United. ""In retirement, I now have the time to visit the places and people that will feed my passion, so I felt it made sense to release a large number of the wines I had collected over the years. I hope many will enjoy exploring my collection."" The lots span over a quarter of a century, including six bottles of Romanee-Conti Grand Cru 1999 from the year United won an historic Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League treble. Valued at between $84,000 and $109,000, the lot also comes with a signed United shirt from their Champions League final win over Bayern Munich 15 years ago. ""While Alex Ferguson's reputation and standing in football is renowned the world over, we are thrilled at Christie's to be able to showcase his exceptional taste in fine wine,"" said David Elwood, Christie's head of wine. ""This collection includes a roll call of impressive wines, including one of the most comprehensive groups of Domaine de la Romanee-Conti that we have ever offered at auction. ""It is remarkable to see that Sir Alex's talent of picking quality players for the pitch also extends to picking sensational wines for the cellar.""

"Washington (CNN) -- ""Flight"" lands in theaters this weekend, but don't look for the movie on the in-flight entertainment menu the next time you're on a plane. The film opens with a catastrophic aircraft malfunction, forcing seasoned pilot Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) to make a crash landing. First lauded as a hero for saving nearly everyone onboard, investigators later find out Whitaker had alcohol in his system. It's just one of the nightmares played out in a host of Hollywood films you'd probably rather be on terra firma to watch. ""I keep saying this was born out of my two greatest fears: drinking myself to death and dying in a plane crash,"" screenwriter John Gatins told CNN. ""It's like, wrap those two fears together and put it in this movie."" Review: Washington keeps ""Flight"" grounded . ""I much prefer my disasters to happen in a movie than in real life,"" said ""Flight"" director Robert Zemeckis. ""I'm not afraid to fly. I read the statistics, and I do believe that flying is the safest form of transportation, much safer than driving in a car."" Not all of the cast share the same confidence. John Goodman, who plays Whip's best friend and enabler won't be watching ""Flight"" or any other airplane disaster movie while flying. ""Oh, God I hope not,"" Goodman said. ""I do better without thinking, but I've had trouble flying for a long time."" Washington shrugged off any suggestion that his work on the film could make him a nervous flier. ""I mean, it's just a movie,"" Washington said. ""Well, worrying about it isn't going to change anything, so I don't worry about it."" Melissa Leo, who plays a National Transportation Safety Board investigator in the film, is similarly unconcerned about life imitating art. ""You know, I've done a handful of 'Law & Orders' in my day. What, am I going to worry that I'm gonna become a murderer?"" she said. ""As I pass the pilots in the airport, I like to feel that they're incredibly responsible people who understand the responsibility they're taking on."" While flying is certainly statistically very safe, ""Flight"" brings to mind more than a few films that could make even the most confident passenger jittery. Here are 10 more movies that might be better to watch on the ground. ""Airport"" This 1970 drama takes off with a blizzard, closed runways and a suicide bomber planning to blow up a Boeing 707 so his wife can collect the insurance money. The blockbuster includes what Variety called ""a cast of stars as long as a jet runway,"" including Dean Martin, Burt Lancaster and George Kennedy. It won an Academy Award and was nominated for nine others, including best picture. Three sequels followed, including ""Airport 1975,"" in which a small plane slams into a 747, ""Airport '77,"" in which a 747 crashes and sinks to the bottom of the ocean with passengers trapped aboard, and ""Airport '79: The Concorde,"" in which the supersonic jet has to avoid attack and make an unusual emergency landing. ""Airplane!"" While ""Airport"" played terror in the sky as a serious drama, ""Airplane!"" (1980) , starring Leslie Nielsen, Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty plays it as farce. When the pilots are sickened by their fish dinners, it's left to Ted Striker (Robert Hays) to land the plane safely. ""It is sophomoric, obvious, predictable, corny, and quite often very funny. And the reason it's funny is frequently because it's sophomoric, predictable, corny, etc.,"" wrote critic Roger Ebert at the time. Honorable mention: ""Zero Hour,"" the 1957 film that took virtually the same plot seriously and contributed much of the dialogue for ""Airplane!"" almost verbatim. ""United 93"" This intense drama takes place on the flight hijacked on 9/11 that eventually crashed into a field in Pennsylvania as passengers tried to regain control. The movie, made five years after the attacks, was described in 2006 by Entertainment Weekly as ""a harrowing, documentary-style reenactment, in real time, of what might have happened on the one airplane that didn't fulfill the terrorists' intended goals on Sept. 11."" Included in the cast are some Federal Aviation Administration and military employees who were on duty and dealt with the hijacked plane on the day of the attacks. ""Cast Away"" Even if you're traveling with an anthropomorphic volleyball, the movie ""Cast Away"" (2000) could make you a bit jittery. A FedEx executive, played by Tom Hanks, is the only survivor of a plane crash and is forced to learn to live stranded on a deserted island with only a Wilson volleyball as a companion. ""Snakes on a Plane"" ""All anyone really needs to know about this amusingly crude, honestly satisfying artifact is snakes + plane + Samuel L. Jackson,"" wrote The New York Times at the time of the 2006 release. Crate loads of hyped-up serpents start killing the cast in creative ways as Jackson's character tries to figure out how to save the aircraft and the FBI informant onboard. ""Alive"" This 1993 drama tells the true story of a plane crash in the icy Andes Mountains of South America. The crash is only the start of the survivors' ordeal as they are forced to live on the treacherous mountainside facing starvation, the elements and the fact that they may never be rescued. ""Passenger 57"" Charles Rane picks the wrong plane to hijack because of the man who happens to be passenger 57. ""Wesley Snipes quips, glares, and kung fus his way through the role of John Cutter, a terrorism and hijacking expert who happens to be aboard the same plane as a terrorist hijacker,"" wrote Entertainment Weekly at the time of the film's 1992 release. A battle of wits ensues between Cutter and Rane on the L-1011 aircraft and in a Louisiana carnival. ""Twilight Zone"" A gremlin on the plane's wing at 20,000 feet could make anyone's flight a bit nerve-racking. The 1983 film (with Jon Lithgow) and the TV episode (with William Shatner) 20 years earlier both feature men who see something out to sabotage the plane on the wing but can't get anyone else to believe them. ""Die Hard 2, Die Harder"" In this 1990 sequel, Bruce Willis returns as John McClane to fight terrorists trying to free a captured Latin American general by taking over Dulles Airport near Washington and trying to force planes circling overhead to run out of fuel. McClane, whose wife is on one of the planes, ""places first in every event, including wrestling for guns, jumping onto conveyor belts, being ejected from cockpits, leaping onto the wings of moving airplanes and fighting with the authorities,"" Ebert wrote. ""The Terminal"" If you think you are out of the woods when your plane touches down, you might want to keep ""The Terminal"" (2004) stowed away. The film starring Tom Hanks revolves around a man trapped in legal limbo at JFK Airport. Unable to return to his home country and unable to clear customs and enter the United States, he's forced to figure out how to survive inside the terminal. Would you watch these on a plane? What films would you add to our list?","While flying is statistically very safe, many films dramatize worst-case scenarios .
The new film, ""Flight,"" starring Denzel Washington, is probably not a film to watch on a plane .
""Airplane!"" turns the conventions of an in-flight nightmare upside down, playing them as comedy ."

"(CNN) -- Qatari Sheikh Joann Al Thani has broken the world record paid for a yearling filly by splashing out $8.38 million for a daughter of 2001 Epsom Derby winner Galileo at the Tattersalls bloodstock auction in Newmarket, eastern England. Galileo also sired the unbeaten Frankel, who retired last year as the world's highest rated racehorse after 14 straight wins. The mare, Alluring Park, is a half-sister of the 2008 Epsom Derby winner New Approach. Sheikh Al Thani, the son of a former emir of Qatar, won Europe's most prestigious race, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, Sunday with the filly Treve and will be hoping his new purchase can achieve similar success. Nicolas de Watrigant, the agent who bought the filly on the Sheikh's behalf, spelled out the reasons for the record breaking purchase, the most paid at auction in Europe for a horse of any age. ""She is a magnificent specimen,"" he said. ""We bought her sister last year and we think she could be special. ""We didn't want to miss this one -- let's hope she is the next Treve."" Bidding on the filly, a sister of 2012 Epsom Oaks winner Was, was brisk with Irish owner John Magnier competing strongly for the purchase. ""We didn't expect to pay that sort of price, but Al Shaqab Racing (Ali Thani's operation) was keen to invest, said de Watrigant. Treve is trained by Criquette Head-Maarek but the record breaking filly will be sent to French rival Andre Fabre for race preparation. Trading at the famous Tattersalls October auction has been brisk all week and on the opening day Magnier purchased another Galileo sired offspring, a colt, for $6 million, briefly a European record for a yearling. The prices paid fall well short of the record for a Thoroughbred horse, the $16 million paid for a two-year-old colt called Green Monkey at an auction in United States in 2006. The horse, a descendant of the famous sire Northern Dancer, suffered injuries and his racing career was limited to three starts without a victory.","World record price paid for a yearling filly .

"(CNN) -- At least 29 students died in a February 25 attack on a college in Buni Yadi, northeastern Nigeria, during which several buildings were torched. The attackers escaped the scene, but Nigeria's military suspects that the militant group Boko Haram, which has wreaked havoc in the region for several years, are the perpetrators. The Nigerian government is struggling to control the bloodshed between the mainly Muslim north and Christian south that has claimed more than 3,000 lives since Boko Haram came to prominence in 2009, according to Human Rights Watch. Who are Boko Haram? Boko Haram means ""Western education is a sin."" The group's ambitions range from the stricter enforcement of Sharia law -- which is derived from the Koran as the ""world of God"" -- across the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria, to the total destruction of the Nigerian state and its government. What's causing the unrest? Armed militant groups in Nigeria's northeastern region are nothing new, but Boko Haram has taken the violence to unprecedented levels since 2009, murdering and kidnapping Westerners and bombing schools and churches. In late 2013, Human Rights Watch said Boko Haram had abducted scores of women and girls and used children as young as 13 in their campaign of violence. The country's immense oil wealth is concentrated in the south, while the predominantly Muslim north remains extremely poor. There were riots and accusations of vote-rigging when former military ruler Gen. Muhammadu Buhari, much of the north's favored candidate for president, lost to Goodluck Jonathan, who hails from the south, in the 2011 national election. What's the Nigerian government doing about it? In mid-May the Nigerian government declared a state of emergency in three northeastern states -- Adamawawa, Yobe and Borno state -- and created the Joint Task Force wing of the military to try to stamp out the insurgency. A media blackout has also ensued, which ensures that communications in and out of the remote area are nearly impossible and that the Nigerian military can operate out of the media spotlight. The military has been accused of committing atrocities against civilians by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. After raising concerns with Nigeria's foreign minister last May, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said: ""The government has acknowledged that there have been some problems ... they're working to try to control it."" In November 2013, Nigeria's national assembly extended the state of emergency for a further six months at the President's request. Is the violence a purely sectarian dispute? While it's easy to frame the violence as Christians versus Muslims, it's much more than sectarian. Boko Haram will attack other Muslims when they feel they're not adhering to strict Sharia law. Meanwhile, the Joint Task Force's actions in the region aren't winning them any fans -- and there are also vigilante thugs who stop and search cars entering northeastern cities like Maiduguri. Why has Boko Haram attacked mosques in the past? Boko Haram doesn't view all Muslims as supporters and allies -- and there have been suggestions that the group is attacking certain mosques because members of that mosque have assisted the Joint Task Force in tracking members of the militant group. Does Boko Haram enjoy support from the people? Although the northern populace mostly abhors the violence, there is considerable local sympathy and support for Sharia law, seen by many as the only way to put an end to what is widely regarded as a corrupt and inept government. Northern Nigeria has some of the worst human development indicators in the world -- and as the military struggles to stop the spread of attacks from Boko Haram's base in the northeast, the militant group is winning perhaps its most important battle: making Nigerians question the competency of their government. Could the violence spread to other countries? It already has. Boko Haram is active in neighboring Cameroon, where a French family was kidnapped in February 2013, as well as a French priest in November that year. And in a video released in August 2013, the group's leader, Abubakar Shekau, said: ""Our strength and firepower is bigger than that of Nigeria. Nigeria is no longer a big deal to us, as far as we are concerned. We will now comfortably confront the United States of America."" The U.S. says the group has links to the al Qaeda affiliate in West Africa, and extremist groups in Mali. In March 2011, Gen. Carter Ham, then the commander of U.S. Africa Command, warned Congress that Boko Haram elements ""aspire to a broader regional level of attacks,"" including against United States and European interests. Why isn't the international community stepping in? In November 2013, the U.S. State Department designated Boko Haram and its offshoot Ansaru as ""terrorist organizations,"" legally enabling Washington to take various steps against the groups, their members and their supporters. A year earlier it had designated the leader of Boko Haram as a terrorist and put a $7 million bounty on his head, in addition to providing technical and financial support to the Nigerian teams fighting on the ground. But there's a growing international reluctance to put boots on the ground unless there's a direct national security threat to the West, like in the case of the French intervention in Mali last year. Why is Nigeria so important to the region and rest of the world? What's the role of oil? Nigeria, with nearly 175 million people, is considered the political and economic powerhouse of West Africa. Rich in oil, the country is a key U.S. partner and has a massive banking sector. China is the biggest trade partner for Africa, and Nigeria is the hub of global business in the region.

"(CNN) -- Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos rescued sunken treasure in the Atlantic this year: components of two F-1 rocket engines. Now he says he has verified that they are engines from Apollo 11, the first mission that took U.S. astronauts to the moon. The timing, as Bezos is aware, is appropriate. Saturday is the anniversary of the 1969 moon landing. ""44 years ago tomorrow Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon, and now we have recovered a critical technological marvel that made it all possible,"" Bezos wrote on his blog. Bezos congratulated the conservation team at the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center in Hutchinson, Kansas, for its efforts. One of the conservators discovered that the number ""2044"" had been stenciled in black paint on the side of one of the massive thrust chambers. He found it while using a black light and a special lens filter. This 2044 was not a mystery. According to Bezos, it corresponds to NASA number 6044, the serial number for F-1 Engine No. 5 from the Apollo 11 mission. The conservator continued his work on this thrust chamber and, after removing more corrosion, found a stamp on the metal surface that said ""Unit No 2044."" ""Conservation is painstaking work that requires remarkable levels of patience and attention to detail, and these guys have both,"" Bezos said of the Kansas conservators. An Internet retail mogul might seem an unusual patron of Apollo 11 artifacts and history. But Bezos said he was inspired to dream big by watching the original moon mission as a 5-year-old in 1969. More in space news: OK, everybody, wave at Saturn! The Amazon chief announced in March that his team of researchers had discovered a set of giant rocket engines that he described as ""an underwater wonderland -- an incredible sculpture garden of twisted F-1 engines."" They were found in 14,000 feet of water off the Florida coast. F-1 engines powered the Saturn V rocket carrying Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins on the Apollo 11 mission to the moon. At an altitude of about 38 miles, the first stage of the spacecraft, including the engines, separated. These parts were considered destroyed or lost forever. Bezos had said in 2012 that he wanted to find the Apollo 11 rocket engines but noted that many serial numbers are completely or partly missing. ""The components' fiery end and heavy corrosion from 43 years underwater removed or covered up most of the original serial numbers,"" he wrote on his blog Friday. More in space news: Gold comes from collisions of dead stars, scientists say . Each of the engines weighs nearly 9 tons, and they came in a cluster of five. They provided 32 million horsepower by burning 6,000 pounds of fuel every second, and together, they lifted the largest rocket in history 38 miles above the Earth in less than three minutes. After separation, the rocket engines made their re-entry at 5,000 miles per hour, Bezos said, and then plummeted into the ocean. That's where they remained, undiscovered for decades, until Bezos' team found them using sophisticated sonar. ""The technology used for the recovery is in its own way as otherworldly as the Apollo technology itself,"" Bezos wrote in March. ""The Remotely Operated Vehicles worked at a depth of more than 14,000 feet, tethered to our ship with fiber optics for data and electric cables transmitting power at more than 4,000 volts."" His team felt the echoes of the moon mission as they probed the icy depths of the ocean: ""The blackness of the horizon. The gray and colorless ocean floor."" Having taken space venturers to the moon, the engines are now the treasure of a different breed of explorers. Bezos said he intends to put the hardware on display ""where just maybe it will inspire something amazing."" Follow Elizabeth Landau on Twitter at @lizlandau .

"New York (CNN) -- A new medical device that could save thousands of lives by preventing opioid overdoses was approved Thursday by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The hand-held auto-injector is designed for family and caregivers to administer a single dose of a drug called naloxone, which rapidly reverses the effects of heroin and other opioids. Called Evzio, the emergency treatment works like the well-known EpiPen -- an epinephrine auto-injector for serious allergic reactions -- as it is injected into the muscle and does not require training, making it more user-friendly. Once injected, the naloxone stops heroin and other opioids from slowing a person's breathing down to the point that it stops. The FDA approved the prescription treatment after just 15 weeks under priority status. Naloxone has long been used in ambulances and hospitals, but Evzio now allows nonmedical personnel to carry the drug in a pocket or to store it in a medicine cabinet. As use of the new tool becomes more widespread, New York state is doing its part to help combat the epidemic. That was New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's message Thursday as he announced a new program to provide all state law enforcement officers with naloxone and train them to use it. It's the first state in the nation to do so, using $5 million in seized drug money to fund their Community Overdose Prevention (COP) program. Currently, most law enforcement agencies are using the nasal spray version of the antidote, which is slightly different than the auto-injector. It comes in a kit that costs about $60. With a shelf life of two years, every kit has two pre-filled syringes of the drug, along with other items to help use it safely. Schneiderman says using naloxone allows victims to be brought back ""from the brink of death and buys more time to get to a hospital."" Noting that there were more than 2,000 opioid overdoses in New York in 2011, Schneiderman said, ""It isn't every day that we can announce that we will save lives."" More than 500 lives were saved last year in Suffolk County, where police officers have been part of a pilot program since 2012 to carry naloxone, Schneiderman said. The antidote saved the life of Angie Ruhry's son, Peter, in 2009. Though he died 18 months later, Ruhry said ""Those 18 months were a gift. Anyone that's lost a loved one knows that even one more day is a gift."" She emphasized her support of the program, saying, ""People are dying and we have this powerful tool to save lives in the midst of the epidemic.""","Evzio is an auto-injector for naloxone, which reverses effects of heroin overdose .

That is what I tell my negotiation students when they give blustering ultimatums and ignore what the other side wants. And that is what I wish someone would tell the parties in Washington battling over the budget and a looming default. So, what do you do when you realize you're in a negotiation where everyone will be worse off if no one finds a path out? Consider the following: . 1) The immediate problem is not how you got here, it is how you are going to get out. There will be plenty of time later to learn and teach lessons. Right now you need to find a path to a better outcome. Accusations, dissections of past mistakes and allocations of blame will only make it harder to get there. 2) There is no ""they"" on the other side. Parties in negotiation tend to say, ""They are unreasonable,"" ""They are negotiating in bad faith,"" or ""They are crazy!"" Of course, in the current congressional struggle, pundits and politicians are saying far worse (such as ""They are anarchists"" and ""They are fascists.""). But thinking of the other party as ""they"" empowers the most extreme people on the other side. Instead you need to figure out who is most sympathetic to your position and who is least. And you need to negotiate in a way that empowers those most sympathetic and marginalizes the rest. When a party's position is extreme, responding in an extreme way only unifies the other side's moderates with their extremists. 3) Don't just throw the steering wheel out the window. I recently heard a ""negotiation expert"" on the radio. He said that when you are in a game of negotiation chicken, you should throw your steering wheel out the window and then tell the other side that you can't turn. But what happens when both sides follow his advice? There is a reason you don't see many real games of chicken. And there is a reason that no one actually throws the steering wheel out the window if he or she does play chicken. Those people don't live very long. 4) Keep your eye on your goal and don't get lost in the negotiation game. Strategizing, positioning and winning the negotiation game is exhilarating. But don't get so caught up in the maneuvering that you lose sight of your goals. When Congress agreed that it would give back pay to furloughed employees but not return them to work, everyone lost sight of the goal. Is there someone in the political spectrum who thinks we need to spend just as much money but get nothing for it? 5) Negotiation is not about always meeting in the middle . If negotiations always met in the middle, that would just encourage everyone to take extreme initial positions. Meeting in the middle only makes sense if you are meeting between two reasonable positions. So, an effective negotiator searches for the possible area of overlap between the parties and then tries to maximize the value the negotiator takes away. An ineffective negotiator looks only at what he or she wants and then views negotiation as inflating the negotiator's demands in order to meet back in the middle. 6) Fear can be good. Anger is bad. Too many negotiators focus entirely on trying to scare the other party into making a deal. Not enough negotiators realize they also need to give the other party hope that a deal is possible, and that the deal would be better than walking away. And far too many negotiators push the other side beyond fear to anger. Making others in a negotiation angry just makes it harder to get the deal you want. Why would you ever want to anger the person who has to say ""yes"" for you to have a deal? 7) Insulting the other parties is just throwing away your negotiating capital. If members of the other side feel insulted, they will get angry, and it will be harder to get them to say ""yes"" to anything. And the biggest problem is that it won't matter if you intended to insult them. So, when your worldview is very different from another party's view, be careful that what seems obvious to you is not perceived as insulting by the other party. 8) Playing chicken is for people who love risk, don't value relationships and don't mind losing deals. If you find yourself playing negotiation chicken, make sure you have something to do if you crash. And figure out if the other side is actually prepared to crash. Chicken is for people who like the thrill of winning. Chicken is for people who value getting a marginal advantage in some deals, at the cost of losing other deals entirely. And chicken is for gamblers. Are you one of those kind of people? And, if you are a lawyer, negotiator or member of Congress, are the people you represent those kind of people? Because if they are not, they are likely to be very angry if you crash. And I have already mentioned that anger is bad for negotiators.

"(CNN) -- Florida health officials say they've confirmed eight cases of dengue fever. Those infected have no history of recent international travel, the Florida Department of Health said Tuesday, ""so exposure was likely from local mosquitoes."" The cases were reported in two southeastern Florida counties: Martin and Miami-Dade. Dengue acquired from local mosquitoes is rare in the United States, Florida health officials said, urging residents to take steps such as wearing repellent to protect against mosquito-borne illnesses. Dengue fever is passed from person to person by mosquitoes. Unlike malaria, there are no drugs to prevent it. It also is difficult to treat and thus far, attempts to develop a vaccine have been unsuccessful. The World Health Organization estimates that there are between 50 million and 100 million infections each year. Dengue is most common in Asia and India, but more cases have been popping up in the Caribbean and Latin America in recent years. In mild cases, dengue fever causes a high fever, rash and joint and muscle pain. In extreme cases, it can cause death. According to the World Health Organization, about 12,000 people die of dengue fever each year. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say dengue rarely occurs in the United States. But this isn't the first time Florida has dealt with dengue. In 2009 and 2010, officials documented 28 locally acquired cases in Key West. As dengue cases increase, Honduras declares state of emergency . CNN's Miriam Falco and Jennifer Bixler contributed to this report.","Health officials say local mosquitoes in Florida spread the disease .

"(CNN) -- At least seven people were killed in southwest Guatemala when security forces clashed with protesters blocking a highway, a hospital official said. More than 30 others were hospitalized with injuries, 15 of them in serious condition, Damaris Juarez, a spokeswoman at Jose Felipe Flores Hospital, said Thursday. Most of the victims suffered bullet wounds, she said, although the government says its forces were unarmed in the confrontation, which took place in the country's Totonicapan department. Protesters from 48 local communities had gathered Thursday at a stretch of highway known as Cuatro Caminos to express their opposition to high energy prices, among other issues. The leader of the protests, Carmen Tacan, blamed security forces for the deaths and demanded an investigation, according to a government news release. Guatemalan President Otto Perez Molina ordered an investigation but suggested that the shooting originated from the protesters. ""We are willing to make available the weapons that they may have been carrying, although they -- the soldiers -- had no weapons, but were equipped with tear gas,"" Perez Molina said. ""We have information that it may have been the civilians who initiated the shooting and upon hearing this, the contingent of soldiers exited their vehicles to disperse and avoid harm."" The president said he ordered police and military forces to retreat from the area where the protesters were. In addition to high energy costs, the protesters also oppose an educational reform that will increase the duration of studies needed for a teaching degree from three years to five years. CNN's Nelson Quinones contributed to this report.","More than 30 others were hospitalized, most with bullet wounds, a hospital reports .

"(CNN) -- Sacha Baron Cohen's new movie, ""The Dictator,"" is a modern-day minstrel show judging from the trailer and Cohen's comments promoting the film while dressed as the film's star, ""Gen. Shabazz Aladeen,"" the leader of a fictitious Arab country. Cohen, who is not of Arab heritage, plays this Arab character while sporting a long fake beard and speaking in a strong Arabic accent, which would be fine, except the character is showcasing the worst stereotypes of Arabs. For example, at a news conference in New York City this week promoting his film, Cohen exclaimed: ""Welcome devils of the Zionist media and death to the West."" He then joked about liking TV shows that showed Arab terrorists killing Americans and admiring fashion designer John Galliano for hating the Jews. To me, this is essentially the same as white performers in blackface portraying black people in buffoonish negative stereotypes for the enjoyment of white America. But I am not advocating a ban on offensive comments or the telling of culturally insensitive jokes. I certainly am not calling for more PC comedy. I'm not calling for a boycott of anyone nor asking for one more insincere ""I'm sorry to all those who were offended by me"" from a celebrity. I'm in no way arguing that Arab culture is off-limits or cannot be mocked. I'm a comedian of Arab heritage and have performed comedy shows not only for Arab-American groups across the United States, but also in the Middle East, from Egypt to Qatar to Saudi Arabia. I find the biggest laughs are elicited when performers hold up a comic mirror to Arab culture. But for some reason, the entertainment industry appears to truly enjoy ridiculing ""brown"" people, Arabs and Indians, and has no qualms about casting people not of our heritage to portray us. Indeed, just last week Popchips snack company found itself embroiled in a controversy because an ad showed Ashton Kutcher playing an Indian character in brownface, similar to what Cohen is doing in ""The Dictator."" Here is my simple request to the entertainment industry: If you are going to mock and ridicule us for profit, can you at least cast Arabs and Indians to play us? And while we're at it, why not include us in the creative process as co-writers and directors? If you look at the names of the writers, co-stars and director of ""The Dictator,"" none is of Arab heritage. Ben Kingsley, who is of Indian heritage, co-stars, but if you don't know the difference between Arabs and Indians, go to Google. And let's be honest, these types of buffoonish ""brownface"" stereotypes would not be permitted if it were any other minority group.  What would the reaction be if a white actor in blackface mocked African-American culture? Or if an actor of Arab heritage pitched a movie about the leader of a fictitious Jewish state in which he would portray the Jewish leader and showcase the worst stereotypes of Jews? Is there any chance that film would get the green light from a Hollywood studio? I understand that the entertainment industry is about making money, not correcting negative stereotypes -- even those they helped perpetuate. But why not cast a person who is actually Arab as the sidekick to the star who is pretending to be Arab? Arabs and South Asians have long been ghettoized in Hollywood, playing almost exclusively cab drivers, deli workers, terrorists and the occasional ""good"" guy who works with law enforcement, and who is usually killed later in the movie by a bad ""brown"" guy. But here's the thing Hollywood: Adding people of our heritage to the movie is actually good business. It would help the film rise above the superficial and cliched material we have seen for years when it comes to Arabs and Indians on the screen. For example, the jokes in ""The Dictator"" trailer sound like a less clever version of the material you would hear from comedian Jeff Dunham's ventriloquist dummy ""Achmed the Dead Terrorist."" Hollywood learned this very lesson years ago when it made mafia movies with no Italian-Americans involved in the creative process or as stars. Those films failed because they lacked any true understanding of Italian culture, which would have enhanced the film. That changed when Paramount Studios hired Francis Ford Coppola, then a little-known director, to helm ""The Godfather."" In turn, Coppola hired talented but unknown Italian-American actors such as Al Pacino and John Cazale (""Fredo Corleone"") to be co-stars. The rest is cinematic history. In time, there will likely be an Arab and Indian-American Denzel Washington and Spike Lee. And that will come from a combination of the artists in those communities creating their own projects -- which is increasingly happening -- but also being cast in the bigger budget Hollywood movies. The big studio movies have the greatest reach and are the ones which create stars who then have the ability to get movies made that would present their culture in a more nuanced and entertaining manner. ""The Dictator"" may turn out to be a blockbuster hit or a big budget miss. But I can assure you that the film would have been better if it included some input from the very community being ridiculed by the film.

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- India issued an ultimatum Thursday to the manufacturer of BlackBerry smart phones: Allow access to highly encrypted information by August 31 or face a blockage of two popular messaging systems. The real-time messaging services have been under scrutiny because the encryptions make it impossible for intelligence agencies to monitor and, thus, India says, pose a potential national security threat. India wants law enforcement agencies to gain access to the BlackBerry Enterprise Service and the BlackBerry Messenger Service. ""If a technical solution is not provided by 31st August, 2010, the government will review the position and take steps to block these two services from the network,"" a news release said. What hangs in the balance is the use of BlackBerry for millions in a country with a booming wireless market. Calls placed by CNN to Research in Motion (RIM), the Canadian manufacturer of BlackBerry, were not immediately returned. The Indian government has expressed grave security concerns over the use of highly encrypted services. Some find it hard to believe that the world's largest democracy is taking such a tough stance. But India also has deep security concerns as one of the most-attacked countries in the world. India was shaken after suspected Pakistani militants attacked Mumbai in November, 2008, leaving more than 160 people dead. In that incident, the government eventually tapped into satellite phone conversations between the terrorists and their handlers, but the attack was already under way. Vikram Sood, a retired Indian intelligence agent, said India would be completely blindsided if terrorists used BlackBerries to plot an attack and the devices were inaccessible by the government. ""So what do you do? React after the fact?"" Sood asked. ""If you react after the fact, the explosion has taken place or a terrorist act has taken place, 100 people, 150 people have died. ""Who is liable for that? Is BlackBerry going to be liable because it was withholding information in a manner of speaking? So isn't it better to share? Knowledge and information from all sources is necessary, there are no two ways about it."" The situation brings up an old debate brought on by new technologies -- the government's right to know versus consumers' rights to privacy and free flowing information. The decision will have huge ramifications in India, one of the fastest growing telecommunications markets in the world. More than 600 million Indians use cellular phones, according to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India; 1 million of those are BlackBerries. So the loss for RIM is potentially huge in India. If it loses some of the services it offers, it could have a harder time attracting customers. Telecom operators in the country seem to be hedging their bets. They're working up contingency plans, but not really expecting to lose BlackBerry services, especially considering that RIM was able to make concessions and strike a deal with Saudi Arabia to avoid a ban. The United Arab Emirates has also threatened RIM with a shutdown of services if access to encrypted information is not granted. ""We think it will all be worked out,"" said Sanjay Warke, chief executive officer of telecom giant Vodaphone's India operations. CNN's Sara Sidner contributed to this report.","NEW: After August 31, India will take steps to block two popular services .

"(CNN) -- A slow-moving landslide the size of two football fields is steadily tearing apart a hilltop house from the inside and has prompted the evacuation of about 50 people and several businesses in the well-known skiing town of Jackson, Wyoming, officials said Saturday. The slow movement, however, has only a 5% chance of becoming the sort of violent landslide that killed 36 people last month in rural Washington state, said Roxanne Robinson, Jackson assistant town manager. ""You know, I think that's on everybody's mind, but I think our slide is different because it's slow moving. Theirs was catastrophic, and ours has been slowly creeping down the hill,"" Robinson said Saturday. The 100-foot-deep landslide is moving so slowly that local officials have been able to see how ground cracks are emerging and growing by inches each day the past week. Crews use binoculars to keep an eye on the hill while they stand at a fire truck across the road. A mandatory evacuation order issued Thursday to 46 residential units in the landslide zone remained in place Saturday. Authorities count about 57 residents in the landslide area, but only 48 people have reported to a Red Cross check-in station, Robinson said. The remainder are still residing in their homes or may be away from home, she said. ""There are people living there who have refused to leave. That's their choice because we can't forcibly remove them,"" Robinson said. ""On one side of the (hillside) road, we did have a sinkhole develop, and it's not safe to dig it out and put a man in the hole. On Saturday, about 43 people were escorted to their homes to remove personal items and check on the security of their belongings, according to a press release from the town of Jackson. Emergency personnel will continue to escort residents to their home Sunday. Starting Monday, escorts back to residences will be by appointment only, according to the press release. Red Cross personnel trained a dozen local people Saturday to staff a public shelter they plan to open Sunday evening. For now, officials are doing testing extending 100 feet underground to determine how big of a threat the slide is and what they can do to limit its impact, Robinson said. The town has hired a geologist to examine the matter. At a minimum, a house atop a hill is unlikely to be inhabitable again because its interior wooden floor is splitting into two, Robinson said. The driveway is cracked by a 6- to 12-inch upward fissure in the ground, she added. ""What really struck me is the wood flooring, which is separating,"" she said. ""One half of the house looks like it's on side of the slide area and the other half is definitely at the crest of the slide. ""We did a media tour yesterday,"" she said Saturday, ""and after we did that, the geologist said, 'You can't do that anymore. It's dangerous.'"" The slow landslide began March 4 when the event moved a town water pumphouse and broke a 16-inch water main, sending water gushing into a two-lane highway, Robinson said. The landslide is occurring about a mile west of the town center, on a stretch of highway that's home to a Walgreens that opened with the new year, two restaurants and a liquor store -- all of which are closed for now, Robinson said. The broken water main forced local officials to lay a two-inch water line up the steep hill's surface to connect to 46 residential units -- houses and apartments -- in the landslide zone, Robinson said. On Saturday, crews installed water tanks on the hill as a fire prevention measure because the temporary two-inch water line isn't sufficient for potential firefighting, Robinson said.","A slow landslide in Jackson, Wyoming, is tearing apart a house inch by inch .

"(CNN) -- An X-Box and games, a silver iPod, a Nintendo Wii -- and a wooden knife holder missing two knives -- are among the items removed from the home of the Pennsylvania teenager suspected of going on a stabbing rampage at his Pennsylvania high school, according to court papers. Authorities removed those things from a home owned by the parents of suspect Alex Hribal, according to an affidavit CNN has obtained. Sixteen-year-old Hribal is alleged to have seriously injured at least 20 students and a security officer at Franklin Regional Senior High School in Murrysville, Pennsylvania, on April 9. The teen has been arraigned as an adult. He faces four counts of attempted homicide and 21 counts of aggravated assault.

"(CNN) -- An assistant high school football coach was found guilty of two misdemeanors in connection with the Steubenville, Ohio, rape case that captured national attention in 2012, the state attorney general's office said Tuesday. Matt Belardine, a volunteer coach at Steubenville High School, was sentenced to 10 days in jail Tuesday. He's the first adult sentenced to jail time in connection with the case, in which two members of the school's football team were convicted of raping a severely intoxicated 16-year-old girl. Belardine was the only adult present at an August 2012 party held at his home and attended by both players, Ma'lik Richmond and Trenton Mays, and the victim, Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine's office said. Belardine pleaded no contest to serving alcohol to a minor and making a false statement, charges that carried a six-month maximum sentence each. ""It's very unfortunate the events that transpired that night, you know, with the girl and everything,"" Belardine said in court. He said he believed he made ""the right decisions,"" but ""I didn't make the decisions quick enough."" He said he learned ""a very good lesson -- that no matter what, you should always tell the truth."" In addition to the jail time, Belardine was ordered to serve 40 hours of community service and pay $1,000 in fines. Dan Tierney, a spokesman for the Ohio attorney general's office, tells CNN Belardine was ordered to report to jail on Friday. Two other charges, obstructing official business and contributing to the unruliness or delinquency of a child, were dismissed. He's one of six people indicted by a special grand jury investigating adults involved in the rape case, and his case is the fourth of those to be resolved. William Rhinaman, the director of technology for Steubenville City Schools, is also expected to appear in court Tuesday for a pretrial hearing. He has been indicted on charges of tampering with evidence, obstruction of justice, obstructing official business and perjury. Steubenville City Schools Superintendent Michael McVey faces three felony charges. He's due back in court on a motion hearing on May 5. Richmond, then 16, was released from juvenile detention in January. He'd been sentenced to serve a year in a juvenile correctional facility, but he was credited for the time he served before the trial. Mays, who was 17 when he was convicted, also was found guilty of disseminating a nude photo of a minor and was sentenced to two years. The teens were convicted in March 2013 after a trial that divided the football-crazed Rust Belt town. Lurid text messages, social media posts, as well as cell phone pictures and videos helped raise the national profile of the case, which revolved around Richmond and Mays' actions during a series of end-of-summer parties. The case attracted the attention of bloggers, who questioned everything from the behavior of the football team to the integrity of the investigation. Richmond and Mays have been classified as Tier II sex offenders and will be required to report to their local sheriff's office every six months for the next 20 years.

"(CNN) -- Scott Asheton, who co-founded and played drums for the influential proto-punk band the Stooges, has died. He was 64. The death was disclosed by singer Iggy Pop, who formed the band with Asheton, Scott's brother Ron and Dave Alexander in 1967. ""My dear friend Scott Asheton passed away last night,"" Pop wrote Sunday on Facebook, not mentioning the cause of death. ""Scott was a great artist, I have never heard anyone play the drums with more meaning than Scott Asheton. He was like my brother. He and Ron have left a huge legacy to the world."" Ron Asheton died in 2009. The Stooges were punk well before punk rock came along. At a time when even hard rock bands were putting forth a little peace and love, the Stooges were brash, forthright and polarizing, relying on the brute force of power chords and Pop's peanut-butter-smearing antics to establish a core of followers. ""Taking their cue from the over-amplified pounding of British blues, the primal raunch of American garage rock, and the psychedelic rock (as well as the audience-baiting) of the Doors, the Stooges were raw, immediate, and vulgar,"" Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote on Allmusic.com. Pop told CNN in 2010 that the sound happened partly by accident. The band was a little too ""studious"" in the early days, but after their manager ""pulled the plug on our rehearsal room,"" in Pop's telling, the singer started stalking the manager around the place. Pop's anger rubbed off on the Asheton brothers. ""When I did that, they played differently. Ron and Scott started playing really furiously, and we were rocking,"" he recalled. Iggy Pop roars with a renewed 'Power' The Ann Arbor, Michigan-formed band's first two albums, ""The Stooges"" (1969) and ""Fun House"" (1970), exemplified their sound. The songs were deliberately basic -- two- and three-chord sledgehammers with titles such as ""No Fun,"" ""Dirt"" and ""I Wanna Be Your Dog."" ""Artistically, what our group had to offer really was ahead of its time,"" Pop told CNN. The late Kurt Cobain of the grunge band Nirvana called the Stooges' 1973 album, ""Raw Power,"" his favorite album of all time. The band wasn't immune to its own behavior. The albums didn't sell, and drug abuse took its toll. After ""Raw Power,"" the Stooges broke up, and Scott Asheton joined several other bands. The Stooges reunited in 2003 and released a fourth album in 2007. The Stooges were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010. Social media responded to Asheton's death. ""Deeply (saddened) by the loss of my mate #ScottAsheton,"" wrote photographer Mick Rock on Twitter, who was very much a part of the '70s scene. ""We all lost a hell of a drummer today. Scott Asheton of the Stooges is gone. MC5, Lou Reed, Iggy... These bands changed me and changed music,"" tweeted actor Linden Ashby. Asheton is survived by his wife, Liz, and a daughter, Leanna.

"(CNN) -- Dan Bucatinsky is a gay dad in real life, and he also plays one on TV. The 47-year-old actor, producer and author recently won the Outstanding Actor in a Guest Role Emmy award for his work on ABC's mega-hit ""Scandal."" Along with Lisa Kudrow, Bucatinsky co-produces the TLC show ""Who Do You Think You Are?"" in which celebrities trace their family roots. Off-screen, he and his husband, writer and director Don Roos are parents to two young children, Eliza and Jonah. Bucatinsky wrote about their road to becoming a family in his memoir, ""Does This Baby Make Me Look Straight?: Confessions of a Gay Dad."" CNN spoke with Bucatinsky about the challenges and commonalities same-sex parents find in a world where the definition of ""family"" is evolving. An edited transcript is below. CNN: When you were growing up and coming to terms with being gay, did it ever cross your mind that you might someday be a father? Dan Bucatinsky: It wasn't something that I dared to aspire to. I lived a lot of years in denial. I spent a lot of my teen years promising myself that if it turned out to be true, that I would kill myself. I'm really glad that I didn't fulfill that promise. Even early in my 20s when I came out of the closet, I wasn't really thinking about marriage. I focused on my career, and I didn't have a clear picture of my future as being in a relationship, having kids and having a domestic life. By 27, I was settling down, and it became clearer to me that it was something I was subconsciously craving. I was so envious of the gay men I'd meet who wore wedding rings. I remember feeling some kind of pang in my mid-to-late 20s. Maybe it was too painful to really picture. I felt like it wasn't in my cards. I met Don when I was 27, and we didn't have kids until I was 40. For 12 years we talked about it, but not seriously, until the last five years. I didn't believe it was possible, so now, when I think about it, it's just surreal. CNN: When you talk to young, gay men about parenthood now, do their expectations differ from that? Bucatinsky: It's amazing how different it is now to talk to someone who is exactly my age when I met Don -- a 27-year-old out, gay man (who has probably been out since he was 15). It's a foregone conclusion that if they want it, marriage and kids could be in their future. Parents used to say, ""I love you just the same that you're gay, but it's such a sad, lonely life,"" but that can't be said anymore. CNN: When parenthood was finally happening for you and your husband, did you worry about not having a blueprint for it? Bucatinsky: While we were expecting Eliza, I was in such shock and denial that it was really happening. It didn't occur to me what would happen when we took that baby home. I didn't really think it through. Nor did my spouse and I have long enough discussions about our parenting styles. We have subsequently discovered our differences, which hopefully leads to a little yin and yang with the kids. There were parents that to me were just the ideal. Many of them were straight moms who have just been great, supporting, warm, funny and tough, at least in my perception of them. I'm sure they all had their own bouts of self-doubt. They became my role models, and I hoped I could be as good as them; their kids turned out so great. CNN: Is motherhood necessarily tied to femininity? Dan Bucatinsky: It's not. What I discovered inside me that I didn't realize was there, was mommyness. But by definition of the fact that I'm not a mommy, if I'm finding qualities that I'm describing as ""mommyness"" then why do I have to attach a gender to them? Why can't we move to a time where ""parent"" is an umbrella term that encapsulates a lot of things: discipline, nurturing, sustenance, support and boundaries? When you're a gay dad, you get the question, ""Which one of you is the mom?"" I used to get offended by it, but now I just answer: I am. If you're asking me in the way that I'm using the term ""mom"" loosely, then yes, I have fallen into those more mommyish kinds of roles. Don has fallen more into the daddyish roles, but that doesn't mean that he doesn't do bath time. But straight parents, too, any modern dad now is doing the same kinds of things. It doesn't really have to do with gay or straight anymore. CNN: There's a line in the book: ""We have the added challenge or privilege to expand who we are with our kids."" What is it like to not have these distinct boundaries? Bucatinsky: While there's a certain freedom, it's scary because you have to figure it out and navigate it and negotiate it with the other parent in a way that a lot of my straight friends don't really have to. For them, it's a given: dad just being a dad, and mom acting the way all the moms act. Our roles bounce back and forth a lot. We cover all the bases in a way that might be in a more traditional family: mom does this, dad does that. When you're two men, things are going to be different. Someone naturally falls into the role of the cook, cleaner and Band-Aid putter-oner. Those things were discoveries for us and sometimes challenges, because we both want to make decisions and have to negotiate. CNN: How do you frame ""family"" to your children? Bucatinsky: We refer to a lot of our closest friends as ""aunt"" and ""uncle,"" which is an honor that is usually based on bloodlines. It may be symptomatic of living in a big city where you surround yourself with disenfranchised people who become your chosen family. Straight couples face this; people expect you to have kids and how do you call yourself a family if you don't? Don and I became a family the minute we made a home together. We've introduced two kids into it, but we were a family before that. There were friends in our lives who were just like family, if not closer. Then there's the notion of calling ourselves the ""fathers"" of our children. We're not their biological fathers, but does that make me any less their father? If you can adopt children and be nonbiological parents, you can be nonbiological aunts, uncles, cousins, brothers and sisters. As time goes on and we redefine marriage and commitment and parenthood, we're opening up the ability to define words differently, and I think it's a good thing. CNN: There weren't really portrayals of same-sex parents on TV when you were growing up. How does it feel to be a role model for gay men growing up now? Dan Bucatinsky: You can only imagine how blessed and shocked I feel that I'm not only living the life of a gay father, but also get to play one on television and also portray the struggle between career, family and marriage. Portrayal of same-sex parents have been few and far between, but it's really important that in (""Scandal"" creator) Shonda Rhimes' writing, she does the ""just happens to be"" story about the act of being a parent, which is something that's completely universal. The parents just happen to be both men, both women or single. I grew up watching the same shows everyone else did, ""The Brady Bunch,"" ""The Waltons."" There were so many portrayals of the perfect mom and dad on TV, you would think each person would grow up with the idea that this was the kind of mom or dad they wanted to become. There were no portrayals of gay parents. It wasn't an option, which in a way is one of the most liberating things. You can emerge and forge your own path and not feel like you have to live in the footsteps of any media portrayal. CNN: What do you want your kids to look back and remember about how they were parented? Bucatinsky: There's a reasonableness I aspire to. I don't want to be extreme in any way. I hope that when my kids are older and think back to their upbringing that though they may or may not feel some sense of having missed out on something like having a mom, which they would have every right to feel and explore, they don't feel like they were in want of any love or support. I hope they understand as they grow older that we love them unconditionally, and they derive a sense of self esteem of having lived this way and had fun.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Phil Lesh is on the phone. Bob Weir and Phil Lesh will be taking part in The Dead's April-May tour. ""I wish I could say I once quit my job to follow the Grateful Dead in my VW bus,"" I tell him. ""But honestly, I'm just not that cool."" The bass player chuckles. ""It's mostly trust-fund kids,"" he confides. ""They're the only ones who are able to do that."" I guess you could say I'm a wannabe Deadhead. Like many Americans, I'm fascinated by tales of the Grateful Dead's improvisational live shows and colorful sense of community. Some 40-odd years after the group rose out of San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury scene of the mid-1960s, there's even a popular Sirius Satellite Radio channel devoted solely to the legendary jam band. A few days ago, the four surviving members of the Grateful Dead dropped a sweet New Year's gift on fans -- they'll reunite for their first concert tour in five years. Just as they did on their last outing, Lesh, guitarist Bob Weir and drummers Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann will perform under the shortened moniker The Dead. It's a reverent nod to their iconic lead guitarist, Jerry Garcia, who died from a heart attack in 1995 after a long struggle with drug addiction. Under the banner, ""An Evening With,"" the trek will encompass 19 shows in 16 cities, kicking off April 12 in Greensboro, North Carolina, and wrapping up May 10 in Mountain View, California. The quartet will be joined by guitarist Warren Haynes and keyboardist Jeff Chimenti. iReport.com: Step back to the 1970s . The reunion is something that's been rumored since Lesh, Weir and Hart headlined a ""Deadheads for Obama"" concert in San Francisco last February. Kreutzmann was in Hawaii that night, but he was there in spirit. iReport: Are you grateful for a Dead tour? ""We've never, ever endorsed a candidate -- ever,"" Lesh states emphatically. ""Not even Robert Kennedy. It was a big deal for all of us. But this was the time, and this was the man."" Accompanied by his wife, Jill, and their youngest son, Brian, Lesh even traveled to Reno to knock on doors, in an effort to get out the vote in Nevada -- a battleground state that ultimately went to Barack Obama. Did anyone recognize him when they answered the door? ""Not really. Reno is not really a stronghold of Dead-dom,"" he deadpans. Lesh downplays the band's legacy as founding fathers of a jam band scene that now includes such free-form artists as Phish, the String Cheese Incident and Blues Traveler. ""All we did was steal what jazz musicians did and apply it to rock 'n' roll. If we didn't do it, someone else would have,"" he says. For the tour, look for The Dead to continue their trademark three-and-a-half to four-hour shows (because of their marathon set, there's no time for an opening act). ""We've been accused of being under-arranged. We've also been accused of noodling,"" says Lesh. ""We make it different, make it new every night. We never play the same licks or the same fills twice. There is a set list -- more or less -- but Bobby, in particular, likes to stick things in."" iReport.com: Spending time with Bob Weir poolside . The upcoming tour will feature mostly ""Grateful Dead classics -- the things people like to hear,"" he says, so expect performances of ""Truckin',"" ""Casey Jones,"" perhaps the band's sole Top 10 hit, ""Touch of Grey,"" and maybe even the Holy Grail of Dead jams, ""Dark Star."" Presale tickets go on sale January 13 -- and even though sold-out shows have been a way of life for The Dead, Lesh isn't taking their fan base for granted. ""It's rough times. Of course it's an object of concern,"" he says. ""All you can do is play the best music you can, and hope people can get out to hear it."" iReport.com: Colorful tie-dyes and painted buses are never out of style . All The Dead's members are in their 60s, with Lesh the elder statesman at 68. Two years ago, he underwent surgery for prostate cancer. ""I'm pretty much recovered from that now. I eat right, exercise and work out with weights three days a week,"" he says. He listens to jazz and classical music in his free time, and continues working on his side project, Phil Lesh and Friends. Two of his musical ""friends"" are his sons, Brian, a student at Princeton, and Grahame, who will be graduating from Stanford this year. Lesh hopes they'll make a guest appearance when The Dead hits their town -- if it doesn't interfere with their finals. iReport.com: Young fan sneaks out for rally show . When The Dead announced this tour, Bob Weir released a statement. ""We've got some unfinished business,"" he said. Lesh goes a step further. ""We've got some unfinished music,"" Lesh clarifies.

"(CNN) -- On Tuesday, the CBO released its update to the budget and economic outlook. Many in the media got it wrong. This isn't the first time that's happened. In early 2011, after winning a decisive victory in the House of Representatives, the newly Republican Congress brought H.R.2 -- a legislation that would repeal Obamacare -- up for a vote. It was called ""Repealing the Job-Killing Health-Care Law Act."" It was named under the notion that the Affordable Care Act would result in the loss of millions of jobs. The claim was based on a CBO report on the Budget and Economic Outlook published in summer 2010. But the words ""job killing"" never appeared in the report. What was said (on page 48 for those interested), was that the ACA would reduce the amount of labor used in the economy by about one-half of 1%, mostly ""by reducing the amount of labor that workers choose to supply."" The fact that there would be a reduction in the supply of labor was because the ACA would provide benefits to people. Giving some people Medicaid and others subsidies to help them pay for insurance would leave some people more flush with resources. They might choose to work fewer hours, or not at all. A number of people just under age 65 might have liked to retire before the ACA, but they knew they couldn't get insurance without a job. Since the ACA now would guarantee them more affordable options, they might choose to retire earlier. Also, a number of would-be entrepreneurs might have liked to have struck out on their own, but feared they wouldn't be able to get insurance for the same reason. The ACA would protect them. They might leave their jobs to start businesses. All these projections are considered by most people to be good things. But they all result in people voluntarily leaving the work force. They constitute a reduction in labor, caused by the ACA. And that's what the CBO was talking about. But opponents of the ACA spun this into something bad. And so the ""job-killing"" meme was born. Flash forward to February 4, 2014. The CBO updated its Budget and Economic Outlook for 2014 through 2024. Once again, the CBO reported that there would be a reduction in the labor force because workers will choose to work less because of the benefits they receive. In fact, the CBO thinks that these choices will result in a reduction in the labor force of about 2 million fewer full time positions in 2017. This time the key passage is on page 117-8: . ""The estimated reduction stems almost entirely from a net decline in the amount of labor that workers will choose to supply, rather than from a net drop in businesses' demand for labor, so it will appear almost entirely as a reduction in labor force participation and in hours worked relative to what would have occurred otherwise rather than as an increase in unemployment (that is, more workers seeking but not finding jobs) or underemployment (such as part-time workers who would prefer to work more hours per week)."" Again, for many people this is a good thing. The ACA is letting some people who would rather stay at home -- perhaps to raise their children -- do so because benefits are improving. It's letting people who want to retire early do so because they don't have to wait for Medicare. These things are consequences the people who wrote the law intended, and the CBO reports them as such. I understand why opponents of the ACA have long tried to twist these facts to support a position that declares the ACA is hurting the economy and increasing unemployment. But I'm baffled as to why the media failed to see that the key piece of evidence, the CBO report, didn't uphold their claims. There's a big difference between a reduction in the supply of labor and a reduction in the demand for labor. It's time we all learned the difference. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aaron Carroll.","The CBO updated its budget and economic outlook; many in the media got it wrong .
Aaron Carroll: The claim that CBO projects millions of jobs lost because of Obamacare is false .
He says CBO says there will be a reduction in supply of labor; this is actually a good thing .
Carroll: Because Obamacare would provide benefits, people can choose to stop working ."
"(CNN) -- The 15-year-old who sneaked onto a flight from California to Hawaii has been facing difficult times at school, a man identified as his father said in a published report. The boy, originally from Somalia, ""did not receive education when he was in Africa,"" the man told the Voice of America's Somali service. ""Since we came here, he had learning challenges at school. He was not good at math and science, and I think he had a lot of education problems bothering him."" The boy's story has stunned people around the world because he somehow managed to survive the flight to Maui hidden in a wheel well of a Boeing 767. ""When I watched the analysis about the extraordinary and dangerous trip of my son on local TVs and that Allah had saved him, I thanked God and I was very happy,"" his father said, according to VOA. He described his son as a ""really cool boy,"" a ""very quiet person, always busy with watching the TV and using computer."" ""He was always talking about going back to Africa, where his grandparents still live,"" the man said. ""We want to go back, but due to the current living conditions, we can't go back."" The teen -- who has not been publicly identified -- has told investigators that he was trying to get to Somalia to see his mother, and had no clue which plane went where, a law enforcement official told CNN. He is said to have hopped a fence at San Jose International Airport shortly after 1 a.m. on Sunday, the dark of night cloaking his intentions. He stayed on the grounds for six hours without getting caught, a government official said. The boy told authorities that he crawled into the wheel well and lost consciousness when the plane took off. He survived the nearly five-hour flight in subzero temperatures at oxygen-depleted heights as high as 38,000 feet, authorities believe. Discovered after he apparently regained consciousness in Hawaii, the boy has been recovering at a hospital, according to a state health official. He is in the custody of Hawaii Child Welfare Services workers, said Kayla Rosenfeld, spokeswoman for the state's Department of Human Services. ""He was really soft-spoken and appeared to be tired. His answers were a little slow initially coming out,"" Maui District Airport Manager Marvin Moniz told CNN affiliate KGO. ""We did get him some food prior to the paramedics getting here. We asked if he was hungry. He indicated yes, he was. We got him some teriyaki meatballs and rice and a package of cookies and a bottle of water,"" Moniz said. Once he's ready to go home to California, he'll have access to counselors and psychologists, Santa Clara High School Principal Gregory Shelby told KGO. The teen, who recently transferred to Santa Clara High, is now the talk of the school. Emanuael Golla, a senior, said the boy was extremely shy.

"Giglio, Italy (CNN) -- Engineers succeeded Tuesday in righting the Costa Concordia cruise liner off the Italian island of Giglio, where it had capsized when it ran aground in January 2012, killing dozens of people. ""She is standing upright better than anyone thought she would be,"" said Nick Sloane, the senior salvage master, about the vessel three football fields in length. ""When she started moving, she moved slowly but surely. There was no twisting at all. It was exactly as the plan said it would be."" In an unprecedented and painstaking process that involved massive pulleys, cables and steel tanks, the 500-person salvage crew from 26 countries rolled the 114,000-ton vessel off the rocks on which it had rested since it ran aground. ""It was a perfect operation, I would say,"" said Franco Porcellacchia, the head of the technical team for the cruise line Costa Crochiere, owned by American firm Carnival Cruises. The effort began at 9 a.m. Monday. By midnight, despite delays caused by thunderstorms and the need to tighten a slack cable, the ship had been hauled off the rocks and upward about 25 degrees. That was far enough for the salvage crew to start drawing water into massive steel boxes attached to the exposed side of the hull and then use the weight of that water to finish rolling the hulk onto a steel platform built off the sea floor. Four hours later, the wrecked ship was resting on the platform, said Franco Gabrielli, the head of Italy's Civil Protection Authority. Once the ship was righted, a slashing, diagonal line could be seen separating the white paint of the exposed hull from the brownish muck that had collected on its starboard side. There appeared to be no sign of leaks, Gabrielli told reporters -- a promising sign, as the wrecked liner is full of spoiled food and chemicals in material such as paint and lubricants. ""The sides of the ship will need major work and repair, but today we have really taken a clear step to allow the ship to be taken away,"" Gabrielli said. But first, authorities will temporarily take back possession of the site to look for the bodies of two crew members still missing, Sloane said. Once the salvage crew regains possession of the ship, they will find much work remains, Gabrielli said. A robotic submarine equipped with surveillance cameras will survey the damaged side of the ship and create models needed in planning for the next phase of operations -- the attachment of more buoyancy chambers called sponsons to the starboard side. Once those are installed, water will be pumped out of the sponsons to refloat the vessel. Organizers expect the ship won't be towed away for dismantling until the summer of 2014. ""We will have a lot of things in the next few days to understand what needs to done to bring this venture to a conclusion,"" Porcellacchia said. But Tuesday's predawn accomplishment was met with applause from the people of Giglio, a tiny island that was transformed by the disaster. ""We are not at the end of the operation, but this is a very important achievement,"" Giglio Mayor Sergio Ortelli said. No sign of lost victims' remains . The Costa Concordia ran aground off Giglio in January 2012, killing 32 of the 4,200 people on board. The remains of Russel Rebello of India and Maria Grazia Trecarichi of Sicily have not been recovered. Rebello, 33, was a cruise waiter who was last seen helping passengers off the ship. Trecarichi was on the cruise to celebrate her 50th birthday with her 17-year-old daughter, who survived. The nearly $800 million effort is the largest maritime salvage operation ever, according to Costa Crochiere and its partners, Florida-based Titan Salvage and the Italian marine contractor Micoperi. Reporters and sightseers lined the port and the hillsides during the operation. A complex process . Monday's process, known as parbuckling, was the first step in the plan to remove and scrap the 952-foot ship. The Concordia was rotated onto giant platforms 30 meters (about 98 feet) below the water level, which leaves parts of the ship that have been dry for months submerged and filled with water. No ship this large or heavy had ever been parbuckled before. Normally, crews would have blown up the ship or taken it apart on site -- a cheaper route than what's being done now. But officials say that wasn't an option with the Costa Concordia, because the ship is filled with noxious substances and because the two bodies are believed to be either trapped beneath or inside the ship. What's inside of wrecked cruise ship? Hundreds of people and dozens of companies have collaborated on the preparations, but the parbuckling came down to 12 people, including salvage master Sloane and specialized technicians, who guided the operation from inside a prefabricated control room set up on a tower on a barge in front of the ship. In preparation for Monday, towers were anchored onto the rocky shore and fitted with computer-operated pulley-like wheels. When the rotation began, the wheels guided thick cables and chains that pulled the middle third of the ship from under its belly toward Giglio. At the same time, more chains and cables attached to the sponsons welded onto the ship's port side pulled the ship from the top toward the open sea. Has master mariner in charge of salvage met his match? Noxious substances, other items on board . If things had gone wrong, the ship could have broken apart, causing the toxic contents of the ship to leak. They include thousands of liters of lubricants, paints, insecticides, glue and paint thinners as well as 10 tanks of oxygen and 3,929 liters of carbon dioxide. Refrigerators filled with milk, cheese, eggs and vegetables have been closed tight since the disaster. And the freezers that remain intact contain the rotting remnants of what were once 1,268 kilograms of chicken breasts, 8,200 kilograms of beef, 2,460 kilograms of cheese and 6,850 liters of ice cream. The salvage operators set up two rings of oil booms equipped with sponges and skirts that extend into the water to catch any escaping debris.

"(CNN) -- There are two groups of Republicans: Those who pander to nativists by encouraging anti-Latino prejudice and exploiting the fear and anxiety that come from changing demographics, and those who tolerate the first group. Both groups are spoiling the Grand Old Party. And they're making life too easy for Democrats, who -- while never particularly good at addressing the needs and concerns of Latino voters -- have lately excelled in the neglect department. The more Latinos are antagonized by Republicans, the more they get ignored by Democrats. Ain't that swell? The result for America's largest minority is a political paradox, where the media insists this community has tremendous power while those of us within the community know the opposite is true. We're not getting stronger. We're getting weaker. Such is the misfortune of today's Latino voter, and it's the goal of Democrats to bring it up. When you don't have much to offer, you cling to what little you have -- even if it's just a bumper sticker slogan: ""Vote Democrat. Because we're not as bad as Republicans."" Look at what happened with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California and Rep. Steve Israel, D-New York, when he made remarks about Republicans and racism on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. And recently, Pelosi was asked by reporters if she thought race factors into how Republicans deal with the Obama administration. Pivoting to a hot topic, Pelosi responded: ""I think race has something to do with the fact that they're not bringing up an immigration bill."" First, that took chutzpah. This is the same Nancy Pelosi who, when she wielded the gavel from 2007 to 2009, deliberately kept immigration off the congressional agenda. This was no secret. Her top lieutenant at the time, Rep. Rahm Emanuel, who talked openly about his reluctance to engage the issue, went so far as to label immigration the ""third rail"" of American politics. Did the Democrats' failure to bring up immigration during the two years they controlled both houses of Congress also have something to do with race? It seems only fair to ask, given what Pelosi said about the GOP. The real reason Democrats put immigration on the back burner wasn't racial but political. Labor leaders give lip service to backing the idea of giving legal status to the undocumented, but the rank-and-file aren't sold. Democrats are no more eager to divide their party than Republicans are to divide theirs. Democrats benefit from Republican missteps. If the GOP acts as an obstacle, it saves the Democrats from having to play the villain. Pelosi is right about race -- or more precisely, ethnicity, since Latinos aren't a race -- having a lot to do with why House Republicans won't bring up an immigration bill. Since most immigrants to the United States, both legal and illegal, are now Latino, Republicans are afraid that -- whichever way the debate goes -- they'll be painted as ""anti-Latino,"" which will lead to another beating at the ballot box. Besides, if they restart the immigration debate, Republicans can count on someone in their party saying something idiotic or incendiary that will turn off Latinos. Then along comes Israel. When asked by reporters to comment on what Pelosi had said (notice how helpful the liberal media can be in advancing the narrative that Republicans are hostile to minorities), Israel said, ""To a significant extent, the Republican base does have elements that are animated by racism. And that's unfortunate."" Israel has a point. Many Americans approach the immigration debate by succumbing to racism. They have for 250 years, starting when Benjamin Franklin railed against the Germans in the mid-1700s. That's a ready made constituency. In the last 20 years, a faction of the GOP has stepped up to service it. And whereas, a hundred years ago, the political piÃ±ata would have been the Irish or the Italians, today it's the Latinos. Yet, that's only half the story. Here's the rest: Racism isn't limited to one party. It never has been. Today, you'll find anti-Latino elements of the Democratic Party. Democratic politicians are careful not to say anything ugly. But rank-and-file Democratic voters are more uninhibited with their comments. Travel the country, as I have, and you'll hear the same remarks from Democrats that you hear from Republicans -- about how Latino immigrants are defiant, dangerous or deficient. This is why you see resistance to legalizing the undocumented from normally liberal voters in the South, Midwest and Northeast. Listen up, Latinos. We don't have political power, and we're suffering through a litany of bad choices. But there's a way to improve our lot, and it has nothing to do with demographics. We have to avoid oversimplifying our predicament by blaming only Republicans for the poisonous mood of the immigration debate. Over the years, leading up to the Obama administration's dubious record of deporting 2 million people in five years, Democrats have done their share of damage. Are racism and nativism part of the immigration debate? Of course they are. But the antidote to such bigotry isn't tolerance or open-mindedness. It's respect. And there is only one way for Latinos to get it, and that's by staying in play and making both parties compete for our votes. That's not politics. It's common sense. And oftentimes, one doesn't have anything to do with the other.","Ruben Navarrette: Anti-immigration Republicans are spoiling the Grand Old Party .

"(CNN) -- A 19-year-old woman charged with killing a Pennsylvania man she met through Craigslist has given a second jailhouse interview and provided specific details about other killings she claims to have committed. Miranda Barbour told the Daily Item newspaper of Sunbury, Pennsylvania, that she killed men in Big Lake, Alaska; Mexico Beach, Florida; and Raleigh, North Carolina. In her first jailhouse interview in mid-February, she told the Daily Item reporter she had killed at least 22 men over six years across the country but didn't provide any specific locations. Sunbury Police Chief Chief Steve Mazzeo told CNN he passed along the information to other jurisdictions. ""I'm not saying I do or don't believe it,"" Mazzeo said Sunday. CNN is seeking a response from law enforcement authorities in those three cities. Sunbury police have charged Miranda Barbour and her husband, Elytte Barbour, 22, in one death, the November 2013 stabbing and strangling of Troy LaFerrara, 42, in their car. They connected with him through a Craigslist companionship ad, police said. Investigators tracked the couple through phone numbers in LaFerrara's phone. Police said the couple just wanted to kill someone together for the thrill. They had been married for only three weeks at the time of the slaying and had moved from North Carolina to Pennsylvania after tying the knot. After Barbour's first interview, authorities said they had not corroborated any of her claims, including statements that she was involved in Satanism. ""They are looking for full bodies,"" Barbour told the Daily Item in the second interview. ""They won't find any. But they will find body parts"" of runaways and individuals she described as bad people in Big Lake and Mexico Beach. She told the paper she dumped a body off Interstate 95 in Raleigh but gave no other details. Her lawyer, Edward Greco, told CNN on Sunday he had no comment. In the recent interview, Barbour told the Daily Item that two other men responded to her ad for companionship but never showed up to meet her. ""I tried it a few times, but it never worked out,"" Miranda Barbour told the Daily Item, referring to the couple's plan to kill someone together. ""I knew we were going to do this since the day we met, and we tried, but the others just didn't show up.""

"(CNN) -- There is no mystery to the popularity of the HBO series ""True Detective."" Solid writing, excellent acting by stars Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson and the greatest of all TV currency these days: positive social buzz. The first season of the series ended Sunday night and was apparently so popular that it crashed the HBO to Go app during the time it was on (full disclosure: HBO is owned by CNN's parent company). For those fortunate enough to watch the episode, there was plenty of debate as to whether it was a satisfying ending to a thrilling eight episodes. EW writer Darren Franich noted that ""It was a lot to take in -- an hour that veered more towards philosophy than final-act thrills (although it had plenty of that, as well)."" That publication's TV critic, Jeff Jensen, wrote, ""Culminating a remarkable first season in fine, moving form, 'True Detective's' finale, titled 'Form and Void,' took us to the heart of darkness at the vortex center of its weird fiction -- as well as the final stage of its meta-commentary on the stories we tell ourselves, about ourselves, for better and worse."" Time's James Poniewozik found some flaws in the ending even as he said, ""True Detective was an artfully written, remarkably acted, stunningly visualized portrait of Marty and Rust trying to find the path in an overgrown world of decay."" "" 'True Detective' was the closest thing American TV has done in a while to the British model of drama, a story told in one season, from the keyboard of a single writer (and the lens of one director),"" Poniewozik wrote. ""There was nobody to dilute the creator's perspective, or to call b.s. on it. A more collaborative show, in the typical American model, might have fixed many of its problems."" The Atlantic took the approach of having a ""round table"" of writers discuss the season finale. Spencer Kornhaber, Christopher Orr and Amy Sullivan each weighed in with their thoughts on the show's wrapup. Sullivan said she ""vowed to watch the finale as a fan, not as someone trying to figure it all out."" ""But even as a fan, I still found these dangling threads and implausibilities frustrating because the show practically begged us to get into the weeds, to wade into swampy waters,"" Sullivan wrote. ""That's okay if it winds up giving viewers some extra insight. But it's another thing entirely if the show is just messing with us."" The show attracted plenty of famous fans also. Mario Lopez tweeted, ""I can now say that True Detective had the best first season of any show I've ever seen..."" And according to his Twitter account, actor Colin Hanks was scrambling to find somewhere to watch the show in Canada and finally lucked out.

"(CNN) -- A 15-year-old Massachusetts boy was indicted Friday on an additional count of aggravated rape in connection with the death of his high school math teacher, authorities said. Philip Chism pleaded not guilty last December to murder, aggravated rape and robbery charges stemming from the killing of Colleen Ritzer, 24, on October 22 in the girls' bathroom of Danvers High School. Police said a box cutter Chism had taken to school was the murder weapon. The Essex County district attorney's office said Friday that it presented a grand jury with additional evidence. The new youthful offender indictment alleges that Chism forcibly had sexual intercourse with the victim. ""Aggravated rape is charged when there is serious bodily harm and/or when the rape was committed during the commission of another felonious and assaultive crime,"" the district attorney's office said in a statement. Denise Regan, Chism's public defender, could not be reached for comment. Chism, who is being held without bail, is set to appear January 30 in Salem Superior Court for a pre-trial conference. According to a police affidavit, a ninth-grade student told investigators that Chism became visibly upset when Ritzer spoke after class on the day of the crime about his home state of Tennessee. When Ritzer noticed that Chism was upset, she changed the subject, said the unidentified student, who described Chism as ""talking to himself."" The affidavit includes testimony from witnesses as well as a school video surveillance timeline showing Chism and Ritzer in the same area of the school during the teacher's final moments. In the video, Ritzer appears to enter a second-floor girls' restroom -- apparently a faculty restroom was occupied -- and Chism, wearing gloves and red sweatshirt with the hood pulled over his head, appears to enter the restroom about a minute later, according to the affidavit. Shortly after, a female student enters the bathroom and then quickly walks out, according to the court papers. She told investigators she saw the back of a person who appeared to be changing clothes; the person's rear was exposed, with clothes piled on the floor. The video shows Chism leaving the restroom, returning later with a recycling barrel, and again leaving the restroom pulling the barrel -- this time with a black mask on his forehead, the court papers say. He pulls the barrel outside the building and toward the student parking lot. Investigators said the video shows what appear to be blood stains near the bathroom and on Chism's pants. Court papers detail horrifying final moments of teacher's life . After Chism was reported missing by his mother on the evening of October 22, police had his cellular phone company ""ping"" the location of his phone. The phone was found to be in the vicinity of the Hollywood Hits Theater, where investigators learned the teen had purchased a movie ticket and then left. The affidavit said that, when Chism was spotted by a police officer the next day, he was carrying a knife; a search of his backpack turned up a bloodstained box cutter. Asked where the blood came from, Chism allegedly responded: ""The girl."" He was also allegedly carrying credit cards and driver's licenses belonging to Ritzer, as well as a pair of woman's underwear. Friends, relatives bewildered by arrest of 'storybook kid' in teacher slaying . The armed robbery indictment alleges that Chism robbed Ritzer of credit cards, an iPhone and her underwear. Police discovered Ritzer's body in a wooded area near the school, covered with leaves and debris in an apparent attempt to conceal it, the court papers said. Her throat was slit.

"(CNN) -- The golden boy of Russian Winter Olympic sports Evgeni Plushenko is at the center of a whodunnit mystery in Sochi. Was the four-time Olympian told to compete by the Russian skating federation despite suffering from a back problem? The 31-year-old pulled out of the men's individual competition at the Iceberg Skating Palace because of the injury, on which he has had multiple operations -- just before he was due to skate the short program. Earlier in the Games, he helped Russia to team gold. In an interview with CNN's Amanda Davies, Plushenko said officials had asked him to skate, despite the potential risk and that he had offered to give up the one space eligible in the competition to Russia to a fellow athlete. Asked in a question if he had been forced to skate, Plushenko replied: ""That's right,"" adding that he had wanted to compete but that he simply couldn't. ""I tried,"" he told CNN. ""When we came to the team event everybody understands, OK we can win silver or bronze. We came first and won the Olympic Games. So after that the federation says: 'OK do you want to skate, how do feel?' ""Well, I feel not so good. I feel a problem in the long program of the team event, I missed two jumps -- a triple salko and a triple loop. ""I feel the muscles are sore. I explained to my federation, that maybe somebody else is going to skate. I asked them. They said ... well, what happened, happened."" Shortly after, the 31-year-old announced his retirement from skating. National tragedy . Plushenko's story has read like a national tragedy in the Russian media, and he said the answers to questions over his pullout would eventually come from the president of Russia's figure skating federation Alexander Gorshkov. The federation was not immediately available for comment. ""I'm not able to say right now what happened,"" said Plushenko. ""If you ask the president of the Russian federation, he's going to explain everything. He's going to explain why I tried to skate, why I didn't skate against the other skaters."" Later on Monday, Plushenko backtracked on the version of events he gave in the CNN interview. ""I want to make clear that the federation put no pressure on me,"" Plushenko said in a statement posted on the website of the Russian figure skating federation, citing his poor English for the confusion over the reasons for his withdrawal. ""I don't speak English fluently so my answers could have been incorrectly interpreted. I also could not always understand the sense and nuance of the questions,"" he said. In an interview with Russia's Sovietsky Sport on Saturday, Plushenko said he had offered to step back in favor of Maxim Kovtun after the team competition but the 18-year-old was nowhere to be found and turned out to be unwell. ""They did not find him immediately and then it turned out that he was ill. And they told me, 'You can carry on skating'. I tried to do everything for the country, for the sport,"" he told Sovietsky Sport. So, Russia had no representation in the men's individual competition. Plushenko's wife Yana Rudkovskaya has become involved in the controversy, criticizing journalists for writing ""rubbish"" about her husband, who is due to see a specialist about his back after the Winter Olympics. ""Stop putting pressure on Yevgeny and all his family, it's already simply impossible,"" she said. Rudkovskaya's intervention followed criticism of Plushenko from the likes of triple Olympic gold medalist and pro-Kremlin lawmaker Irina Rodnina, and outspoken lawmaker Vladimir Zhirinovsky -- who told state television: ""Kovtun is shoved aside while this invalid has brought shame on us."" Plushenko made his Olympic debut at Salt Lake City in 2002, winning silver, before taking gold in Turin four years later and picking up another silver in Vancouver in 2010. Gay rights . Meanwhile the skater also hinted he could use his prominent position to help change Russia's approach to gay rights. Russian lawmakers' passage last year of legislation known as the anti-gay propaganda bill makes it illegal to discuss homosexuality in front of children. Plushenko insisted, ""It's not my job,"" when asked about the current law but added: . ""Maybe I can change something. If I can do something I am open. I know many people who are not traditional orientation. Maybe I can help, maybe not. We'll see, we're going to work in this direction.""

"(CNN) -- It is a tragic irony that two countries in Africa -- Nigeria and Uganda -- that for many years experienced the subjugation of colonial rule have recently enshrined into law discriminatory practices that dehumanize their own citizens. In Uganda, a draconian bill recently signed by President Yoweri Museveni makes it a crime to be gay. Any person convicted of ""the offense of homosexuality"" faces life imprisonment. Anyone found guilty of ""funding or sponsoring homosexuality or other related activities"" will be sentenced to a seven-year jail term. Apart from being a flagrant abuse of human rights, the new law will severely impede the efforts of any organization conducting HIV prevention and outreach programs serving gay men in Uganda. Gay men, other men who have sex with men, and transgender individuals are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS -- in Uganda and the world over. Driving a community that is already stigmatized further into the shadows will seriously undermine progress on the global epidemic, progress that depends on reaching the most vulnerable populations. Opprobrium from the U.S. and other nations is greeted by Uganda's leaders with a familiar refrain: Stop trying to impose your values on us. But the United States is as entitled as any nation to espouse a set of values, and if those values enshrine the right of all people to be treated with dignity and respect, then we should make every effort to export them. The struggle against HIV/AIDS, now in its fourth decade, has always also been a human rights issue. In the early days of AIDS in the United States, when confusion, ignorance and hysteria reigned, there were those who called for people with HIV to be quarantined or tattooed. Until recently, HIV-positive people were barred from entering the United States. Fighting for its life in the early 1980s, the gay community rose up and the struggle for gay rights became the civil rights struggle of the tail end of the 20th century. It is far from over, but with the repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell,"" which sanctioned anti-gay discrimination in the military, and victories on same-sex marriage in 17 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, we have made substantial progress. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has called gay rights one of ""the defining civil rights challenges of our time."" Responding to the passage of the anti-homosexuality law in Uganda, President Barack Obama said it would ""complicate"" the United States' relationship with Uganda. Instead, the passage of this blatantly discriminatory piece of legislation should fundamentally alter our relationship with Uganda, a country that receives close to $500 million annually from the U.S. in foreign assistance, largely for HIV/AIDS programs. To make its position abundantly clear, the U.S. should redirect its assistance for HIV/AIDS and other health and development concerns toward nongovernmental and civil society organizations working in Uganda. Indeed, if protecting the human rights of gay people is in fact a priority of U.S. foreign policy, then we should re-examine our relationship with all countries receiving foreign aid and restructure our relations with those that criminalize homosexuality. As Archbishop Desmond Tutu rightly declared in condemning the Ugandan anti-homosexuality law: ""There is no scientific justification for prejudice and discrimination, ever. And nor is there any moral justification."" What does exist, however, is the very real possibility that this cancerous bigotry will spread to other countries wishing to scapegoat an easily targeted minority. If they have an ounce of humanity, the governments of Uganda and Nigeria will repeal these odious laws without delay. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Harry Belafonte and Mathilde Krim.","Harry Belafonte, Mathilde Krim: Uganda passed law that makes it a crime to be gay .
They say this drives HIV/AIDS vulnerable population into shadows; undermines AIDS fight .
They say U.S. has made big progress in human rights crisis of discrimination against gays .

"(CNN) -- A multistate kidnapping targeting a North Carolina prosecutor turns out to be a complicated web of mistaken identity and intrigue, court documents show. Nine people stand accused of participating in a conspiracy to kidnap a Wake County assistant district attorney who had prosecuted Kelvin Melton in 2012. But one of the suspects bungled an Internet search and came up with an address for her father, 63-year-old Frank Janssen, who was kidnapped earlier this month and abused before being rescued from an Atlanta apartment five days later. The plot seemingly begins and ends with Melton, according to a federal indictment handed down from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina on Tuesday. After a jury convicted Melton of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill, he was sentenced to life in prison without parole at Polk Correctional Institution in Butner, North Carolina. It was there, federal documents say, that Melton obtained a cell phone and contacted Patricia Kramer and Tianna Maynard, accused of orchestrating the scheme. Melton instructed Maynard and Kramer to ""assemble a team to travel to North Carolina and kidnap the (assistant district attorney),"" the indictment says. ""Maynard used the Internet to research what she thought was the address of the ADA,"" federal documents say. ""Unbeknownst to Maynard, she had actually found the address of the ADA's father."" Melton oversaw the four-member kidnapping team with a heavy hand, documents say, even instructing each person on their specific role during the abduction and advising them to wear khakis and collared shirts. On April 5, the team left Georgia and arrived at Janssen's home in Wake Forest. One kidnapper stayed with the car. Two more, armed with a handgun and stun gun, lay in wait, while the fourth knocked on the door with a clipboard in hand, according to the indictment. When Janssen opened the door, the assailants ""forced their way into the house and abducted him,"" the indictment reads. Janssen was shocked with the stun gun, pistol-whipped, then restrained and forced into the car for the drive back to Georgia. The ride was not pleasant. ""The ADA's father was forced to remain lying on the backseat floorboard and a blanket was put over his body,"" the indictment says. Kidnapping suspects Quantavious Thompson and Jakym Tibbs ""also restrained the victim with handcuffs, pistol whipped him, and used the stun gun on him dozens of times."" Janssen would remain held against his will at an apartment complex in Atlanta, taped to a chair inside a closet, for the next several days, the indictment says. On April 7, Melton dictated text messages to one of his accomplices to send to Janssen's wife, according to court documents. ""We will send him back to you in 6 boxes, and every chance we get we will take someone in you [sic] family to italy [sic] and torture them and kill them, we will do a drive by and gun down anybody in you [sic] family and we will throw grenades in you [sic] window,"" read one text, according to the indictment. The messages ordered that ""various demands benefiting Melton must be satisfied,"" the document said, and warned that harm would come to more family members and the prosecutor herself if ""cooperation was not forthcoming."" A photo of Janssen, tied to a chair in a closet, was sent to Janssen's wife two days later, along with another text: ""Tomorrow we call you again an [sic] if you can not tell me where my things are at tomorrow i will start torchering [sic]."" The kidnappers did not know the authorities were by then aware that Melton was allegedly masterminding the abduction from his jail cell and that the FBI was already watching two homes in Georgia where members of the plot were staying. That evening, Melton received a chilling text message, court documents show: ""we got car, spot, and shovel."" After Melton allegedly exchanged texts with his co-conspirators ordering them to kill Janssen, bury him and cover up the crime, authorities moved in, the documents say. Just before midnight, the FBI rescued Janssen, and by the next morning, most members of the kidnapping plot were in custody. On Wednesday, Kramer, the only member of the conspiracy who wasn't in custody when the indictment was filed Tuesday, surrendered to the FBI in Atlanta and had a first appearance in court. Kramer, Melton, Thompson, Maynard, Jakym Tibbs, Clifton Roberts, Jenna Martin, Michael Gooden and Jevante Price each face several counts, including a federal conspiracy kidnapping charge. None has entered a plea.","Nine people face charges in kidnapping of Frank Janssen, a prosecutor's father .

"(CNN) -- ""Game of Thrones"" has never strictly followed the book series it's based on, but that fan frustration turned disturbing on Sunday's episode. In the third installment of the fourth season, ""Breaker of Chains,"" fans were flabbergasted by a scene in which Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) forces himself on his sister, Cersei (Lena Headey). It wasn't the incest viewers were taken back by -- Jamie and Cersei's relationship is a crucial thread in the books and on the HBO series -- but the rape. It was a confusing and jarring plot twist, not only because Jaime and Cersei's trysts have been consensual, but because the scene doesn't play out that way in George R.R. Martin's ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" series. As excerpts show, Martin did envision Jaime being the more enthusiastic participant at this point in the story, and Cersei as more hesitant. But, as Martin makes clear on his blog, she wasn't raped. ""Though the time and place is wildly inappropriate and Cersei is fearful of discovery, she is as hungry for him as he is for her,"" he says. That said, ""Game of Thrones"" has made some chronological changes to the storyline, meaning ""neither character is in the same place as in the books, which may be why (the scene) played ... differently,"" Martin went on. ""But that's just my surmise; we never discussed this scene, to the best of my recollection."" It sounds like the director and the two actors starring in the scene didn't talk much about it either. As the episode's helmer Alex Graves told HitFix's Alan Sepinwall, ""nobody really wanted to talk about what was going on between the two characters, so we had a rehearsal that was a blocking rehearsal. ... By the time you do that and you walk through it, the actors feel comfortable going home to think about it. The only other thing I did was that ordinarily, you rehearse the night before, and I wanted to rehearse that scene four days before, so that we could think about everything. And it worked out really well. That's one of my favorite scenes I've ever done."" Graves also appears to have a different understanding of what was portrayed on screen. ""Well, it becomes consensual by the end, because anything for them ultimately results in a turn-on, especially a power struggle,"" he said. Although Martin didn't have a conversation about the controversial moment before it arrived on air, he did always intend for that moment ""to be disturbing,"" the author says on his blog. ""But I do regret if it has disturbed people for the wrong reasons.""","Sunday's ""Game of Thrones"" featured a controversial scene .

For most, crowding around a TV with salty snacks, cold beer and good friends is still the classic way to experience America's biggest sports event. Fox has secured exclusive U.S. broadcast rights to the game, with the telecast beginning officially at 6 p.m. ET Sunday, although pre-game coverage will start four hours earlier. Fox is adding a splash of high-tech wizardry to this year's event -- being played outdoors in chilly northern New Jersey -- with infrared cameras that will show the players' body temperatures. You can employ your own tech tools to enhance the Super Bowl viewing experience -- especially if you can't get near a TV set. Here's a tech primer to enjoying Sunday's festivities: . Stream the game online . Both NFL.com and SuperBowl.com will direct viewers to Fox's live stream of the game, hosted by Fox Sports Go. The FoxSportsGo.com website and iPad app will have a free stream of coverage available to any viewers on a computer or iPad in the U.S., starting Sunday morning at 12AM Eastern Time and ending at 3AM Monday morning.

Officials said they will block live streaming over Wi-Fi and cellular networks in the East Rutherford, New Jersey, stadium because it eats up too much bandwidth. Watch it on (some) smartphones . Fox and the NFL have made some interesting distinctions between smartphones, tablets and computers. While you can stream the game through the Fox Sports Go website on a computer and tune in with the mobile app on an iPad, you can't do the same on a smartphone. The NFL is streaming the game through its official smartphone apps, but there are a couple of catches. To see the game live on a smartphone you have to be a Verizon customer and also pay $5 a month for the premium features. The free app is available for Android, iOS, Windows Phone and BlackBerry devices and will show scores and push custom alerts to people who aren't premium subscribers.

When I step on board I see a frenzy of men with video cameras and flight attendants trying to stop them. But there's no Snowden. So we wait, nervously glancing between the door and the tarmac. There is an unusually high number of men in police-like uniforms surrounding the plane. A hungry media pack is desperately looking for any sign of the man as the clock ticks down to our departure time. The door closes. The plane pushes back. But hope is not dead. He could still be whisked out to meet the plane. That's not what happens. Minutes later the Snowden-less jet is in the air bound for Cuba. The story remains on the ground somewhere in Moscow. After takeoff, we do a row-by-row search. We look in the galleys, the washrooms. I stick my head in the curtained-off rest area for the flight crew. A grey haired Russian man stares back with confusion in the dark space. ""Izvinite."" Excuse me. It all confirms what we were already pretty sure of. Read more: No-show leaves reporters stuck on plane . There's only one area we can't check - the cockpit. It seems unlikely Russian authorities or Aeroflot would allow Snowden to travel in the secure pointy end of the aircraft. But the circumstances of this story fit the general rule I've developed through living in Russia. Anything, no matter how logic defying, is possible. I keep a close eye on the crew coming and going from the cockpit just in case. Frustrated journalists huddle around seat 17a. Its emptiness mocks us. Some earlier reports said this was where Snowden would be sitting. A good part of the flight is spent debating theories on Snowden's plans for escape and his chances of success. What role Russia and Ecuador? It's all just speculation with a little logic thrown in. In other words, like so many people around the world right now, we're all just guessing. But at least we knew he wasn't on the aircraft. Back on earth, my colleagues at CNN had no way of being so certain. Moments before takeoff, I'd communicated by phone there was no sign of Snowden. But that didn't mean he wasn't on board somewhere. And as we crossed the globe I had no way of passing on the results of our detailed search. Neither Aeroflot nor the Russian government had confirmed or denied if he was on the flight. So my news organization was still tracking its path across Russia, Northern Europe, the Atlantic, Canada and the eastern states of America. We even flew very close to CNN's world headquarters in Georgia. Read more: How hunt humiliated U.S. It was not until the aircraft doors opened at our destination and I first felt the sticky, warm Havana air that I was able to call in again and confirm definitively Snowden had not left Russia on that flight. Ah Havana. A much dreamed of travel destination for this Australian journalist. Those dreams would remain unfulfilled. I'd arrived with no accreditation or visa. I couldn't legally enter the country. My Cuban adventure involved one hour in the transit lounge desperately negotiating with officials to allow me back on the same aircraft for the return flight to Moscow. No rum. No sweet cigar scent. No music. But during my brief time in the soulless transit area there were still many incredibly warm Cuban smiles. The return flight was even less eventful. Time was spent writing this account and editing the video story of our travels. In total we endured around 30 hours of pretty darn comfortable business class travel for little journalistic result. It's not the stuff that inspires enormous work satisfaction in my trade. But after arriving back in Moscow and while sitting in this city's horrific traffic, one senior CNN editor thanked me for making the journey. He said the time consuming, sleep depriving, costly act necessary to confirm Snowden wasn't on that flight was highly valuable in our coverage of a story where basic questions remain unanswered.

"(CNN) -- As the song goes: ""Summer lovin', had me a blast."" But for dads with daughters who are falling in love for the first time, it might be anything but a blast. Unless that KABOOM! is the sound of Dad's heart exploding in sadness. Summer can take a harrowing turn when family vacations and young romance intersect. Suddenly daddy's little girl who a year ago wanted to play tennis with you has now completely forgotten you exist. No, she's too busy texting, curling her lashes and scouring the beach for Todd the surfer dude. ""In a certain way dads really do feel jilted, bereft even,"" says neuropsychiatrist Dr. Louann Brizendine. ""They almost feel like they've been left at the altar. Often they think, 'what did I do wrong? How do I get her back?' They'd had this really special, close relationship between dad and daughter then all of a sudden she takes the off-ramp from that relationship."" I remember taking that off-ramp. His name was Mark and he was older (27 to my 18), mysterious and gorgeous. And while my hormone-fueled brain was acutely aware my dad was having a hard time coping -- his wide, frightened eyes might have given it away -- the Mark vortex had rendered me incapable of caring much (Sorry, Dad!). Here's what dad has to say about the experience: . ""When my daughter began a serious relationship with someone several years older, beyond my sphere of influence and probably not to my liking, I felt threatened and powerless. While I may have wanted to feel that she had become independent and in control of her life, I felt a genuine sense of loss and a nagging fear that I may have not done enough to prepare her for the journey. It was one of the more difficult transitions I had to negotiate."" Oh man. Again -- sorry, Dad. Kirsty Ewens says her father had a ""total meltdown"" when she indicated she wanted to live with her boyfriend. So he came up with a solution. He built another house on his property for her and her beau to live in. ""My dad has always overreacted in any fear he would lose my companionship,"" Ewens said. Ya think? ""He calls me 2-3 times a day,"" she says. ""We live (300 feet) apart."" While Kirsty's example would make a fantastic episode of a reality TV show about extreme parenting, much like my dad's angst back then, it's merely illustrative of the intensity wrapped up in the father-daughter bond. A kind of courtship: Finding a mom friend in the big city . ""I think an awful lot of men have a visceral connection with their daughters which is unlike any connection they've ever had with anybody,"" says Joe Kelly, a father to twin daughters and author of the book ""Dads and Daughters."" ""It's just a very mysterious experience. It's also one we never talk about, which adds immensely to the complication of how (the daughter's first love relationship) plays itself out."" ""The silence is really intense and then you combine that with 'OK she's now a teenager and she's rejecting me and rejecting her mother' -- that's part of the process. ... And you know how powerful the love from this female has been in your life and now you see it other-directed. It's a really hard transition."" Kudos to my dad for trying to talk to me about his feelings during that life-altering summer. He'd dropped me off at work one day and as I'd stepped out of the car a gust of wind blew my skirt up, prompting me to force it down with my hands. ""I'm Marilyn Monroe!"" I said with a laugh. Dad told me a few days later that he burst into tears as he drove away. Nice story, Dad, I'd thought, then escaped to my room to lie on the bed, stare at the ceiling fan and listen to very loud Sade music while contemplating Mark's thighs. Sure, dads make the usual jokes about this phase, about how they'll be sitting on the porch cleaning their guns as the new boyfriend arrives to pick up the daughter for a date. They might tell their friends with a wink and a nudge they're imposing a no dating rule until their daughter turns 35. Then there's the whole ""men know what men are like"" thing. Dads remember how they were at that age: sex-hungry, salivating pimply monsters who see girls as random shapes with boobs attached. But there can be so much more to it. Especially for dads who have been invested in their relationships with their daughters. ""It's like he got left for a younger man,"" says Brizendine. ""He feels like an older gentleman who's being discarded. And he basically is. We've done our reproductive duty when (our kids) hit that age. We had babies, created the next generation -- now get out of the way."" I'm jealous of my baby -- a Mother's Day confession . While Brizendine, author of ""The Male Brain"" and ""The Female Brain,"" isn't afraid to remind us of the hard truths surrounding our biology, she's all too aware that these feelings are hugely unpleasant. Some of her patients who are fathers are so torn up, she says, they pick fights with their wives out of frustration. They'll even look outside their marriages for comfort. ""Men may be more vulnerable to having an affair as a reaction to this time in their life when the daughter is completely pulling away and he's feeling dissed and heartbroken, and maybe his wife isn't so understanding about it all,"" she said. And -- cringe alert! -- a dad's confusion over daughter's budding body could also be a factor. ""Nothing scares a dad more than if for any reason he has any sexual feelings towards his daughter,"" says Brizendine. ""If she comes out in a really hot outfit as she starts to develop and he finds himself reacting a little bit like a guy, he's often just mortified. It's a normal reaction."" And poor mom! It's not like she's feeling great about daughter's first romance either. There's a good chance she's being confronted with the reality of her own aging. Your daughter is overflowing with seductive fertility while yours may well be waning. She's rocking miniskirts while magazines are telling you that at your age, you should have long given up on anything that lands above the knee. Was that guy hot for my baby bump? Who knew that a daughter's first love -- while normal and necessary and precious and unbelievably important to her -- could so brutally shake up the whole family, shining the light ever so brightly on that thing we call the cycle of life? Take heart, dads, there are some Band-Aids you can apply when your relationship with your daughter hits the skids that aren't dangerous distractions like affairs and fast mid-life-crisis cars. ""Talk to other fathers,"" says Kelly. ""It's a really important thing to do. Veteran dads are valuable."" So is trust. ""Trust your daughter,"" says Kelly. ""It's much easier to do if you've been able to trust her all along. View trusting your daughter as a way of building her strength, as the most effective way to protect her because then she can learn how to protect herself."" Just because she'd now rather go get a bikini wax than wax philosophical with you doesn't mean she no longer values your approval. Celebs and civilians alike expected to 'bounce back' after baby . Scott Monaghan, a father to three teenage girls, says he just tries to focus on being as reassuring as possible. ""My challenge has been to fight the message that the culture sends: that being beautiful with the perfect figure is what is important,"" he says. ""I have tried to teach that it's who they are, not what they look like, that is most important. All that being said, they are going to have to turn over a whole lot of coal before they find their diamond. I have let them all know I will always have their back."" Brizendine likes to reassure forlorn dads that their daughters' transformation isn't designed for the sole purpose of making their fathers miserable. ""Dad should just realize that this is a really normal part of life for the daughter to be going off on her own...into the young woman stage of life,"" she says. ""And he is going to have to give up part of that special relationship with her. And know that she will come back to him in another five or 10 years as a more grown up young woman."" Mark, the guy from the ""Marilyn Monroe summer,"" is so far out of the picture now that his face is a blur. But Dad is still around. He was here yesterday, in fact, drill in hand, assembling a curtain rod in my daughter's nursery. Later he stood at the window, baby in arms, pointing out fat pigeons while she counted them and cooed. There's Dad, years later, helping prepare another little lady for the big wide world.

"Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda (CNN) -- The forest was in charge. I knew it the moment I gazed at its dense green overcoat, searching for cracks of daylight in its chaotic folds. Inspiring in the morning kiss of gentle light rays; sulky under a black afternoon cloud; serene in the falling dusk, as the haze of twilight accentuated its mystery. I was in Uganda's Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, part of a guided trek to see some of its 300 endangered mountain gorillas. The moment I stepped in I surrendered. It was humid and dark and the dense, feisty foliage that enveloped me was dismissive at times, taunting at others. All the trekkers were handed a tall narrow stick to help navigate through the slippery slopes. The moist leaves scattered on the soil demanded balance, stinging nettles and hiding holes urged utmost caution, centuries-old greenery wrapped its arms around me, challenging me to hack through the twisted vines and untested trails. It tripped me over again, slipping, sliding. I grit my teeth knowing the forest was forcing me to want the prize it hid in its shape-shifting bosom. The target: a group of eight gorillas, one silverback and his eight babes. Three sweltering hours that drew blood and inflicted bruises, yet I pushed on, realizing the forest would not give me something for nothing. One Olympic obstacle course after the other, crisp slices of machetes hacked the twines, daring the forest to dissuade us. Three hours of grueling walking scattered with hard landings. No matter how contorted I became, the forest kept a piece of itself handy to cling on to, a mini consolation prize hinting that it was, after all, on my side. I could almost hear its heaving chuckles as I disentangled myself from ropes of thorns. ""Keep going,"" the rangers called out as I felt the sweat dribble down my back. No matter how much I wanted out, I had to push on, because there was no way out without rangers slicing pathways through the wild bush. I received a painful sting from a large black creature with loud wings; I ignored it and walked on with my muddy water-logged shoes, and the threat of rain. ""We're here,"" the lead ranger whispered, stopping dead still and turning up the drama, punctuated by a light breeze that picked up along with a list of rules of gorilla engagement, which we absorbed. ""Stay seven meters away."" ""If you want to cough or sneeze, turn away, you could infect them with your germs."" ""One hour only."" It was a rare 60 minutes, the shortest, the most fascinating. I lifted my eyes and there she was, a giant gorilla clinging onto a tree trunk, sucking the bark out of an apparently delicious eucalyptus tree, getting tipsy; sitting in shade, munching shoots and leaves, and then nonchalantly striding by. I observed their powerful arms, elegant posture, and the occasional eye contact made me feel connected. They are intimidating and gentle, protective and patient, flirtatious and fearsome, at the same time. Protected by a hardcore ring of black backs, a mother nursed a three-week-old gorilla. It was a rare and moving sight. She hid her offspring under her belly, ""protection from vultures,"" we were told. Immersed in their world, listening to their language, the beat of their group, the simple raw reality of their lives and tribe, I forgot my complex world.

"(CNN) -- There is one essential truth emphasized by every former killer whale trainer who appeared in ""Blackfish,"" a film featured on CNN and recently nominated by the British Academy Film Awards for best documentary: . They all speak movingly about how they respect and love the animals with which they shared their days and had a deep, special bond with them -- as do all professionals who work for zoological parks and aquariums. But ""Blackfish"" ignores the essence of parks and aquariums -- their dedication to wildlife research, conservation, education and rescue of stranded marine mammals. And, most importantly, it ignores their commitment to the animals' welfare, providing them with loving, state-of-the art care based on the latest advances in science and insights of experience. Marine parks help wildlife, inspire, educate . Conservation scientists and wildlife researchers need marine parks and aquariums to learn how to better save animals in the wild. There's not a single mention of this in ""Blackfish."" Today's pressing conservation and scientific questions cannot be answered by studying only marine mammals in the wild. Much research depends on detailed case histories or the control of experimental variables. Aquariums fund studies on the diets, reproduction and immune systems of marine mammals as well as evaluate contaminants affecting certain species to help understand and improve animals' health in the wild. The world's longest running study of a wild dolphin population is led by a zoological society. Marine parks have explored technologies to protect wild animals from fishing gear that cause many deaths each year. Also, animals in human care are surrogates for studies of wild, endangered species that would be impossible to complete without disturbing their vulnerable wild counterparts. Research is also ongoing with dolphins that could help scientists discover what triggers diabetes in humans. The National Marine Mammal Foundation's website hosts reams of research funded by aquariums and undertaken by marine mammal scientists, including studies that ensure the exceptional health care provided whales and dolphins in aquariums. Educators at zoological parks and aquariums are a dedicated group of amazing, caring individuals who play a major role in alerting the public to the plight of our oceans and the challenges facing killer whales and all marine mammals in the wild. School programs, summer camps and off-site programs developed for teachers, schoolchildren and community groups reach millions annually. Tens of millions learn about marine mammals yearly through marine parks' computer learning programs, websites, publications and television programming. Educators emphasize a humane approach to wildlife, teaching compassion and respect for all animals. They motivate and inspire children and adults to become better stewards of the environment. Seeing these beloved marine mammals up close at parks and aquariums drives home these important conservation messages. One former trainer spoke briefly in ""Blackfish"" about the benefits of education programs at parks and aquariums. But not a word about these important conservation activities appears in the documentary. In ""Blackfish,"" Howard Garrett, co-founder and director of the Orca Network, talks about killer whales' natural history, languages and family bonds. What you don't hear in the film is the Orca Network's concerns about killer whales in the inland waters of Washington state and British Columbia. According to the organization, Chinook salmon -- orcas' main food source -- is in ""historic decline throughout the region. Habitat degradation, industrial poisons such as PCBs, PBDEs, and other impacts of human activities are taking their toll on the orcas we have come to know and love."" Saving stranded animals . It is not uncommon for hundreds and even thousands of sick, injured or orphaned marine mammals to become stranded on U.S. beaches annually. Marine parks and aquariums and other dedicated stranding centers are the unsung heroes that nurse the animals found alive back to health and release them back into the ocean. They study the causes of strandings, most recently about 1,400 young California sea lions that beached on the West Coast and the morbillivirus outbreak the killed hundreds of wild dolphins along the mid-Atlantic coastline. On these extraordinary, caring activities, ""Blackfish"" is again silent. Parks and aquariums alone spend millions of dollars each year responding to, rescuing, providing veterinary care for and safely releasing stranded animals; underwriting hundreds of hours of their professionals' time; and organizing about 60,000 hours of volunteers' time to meet these challenges. The movie ""Dolphin Tale"" gave the public a glimpse of the lengths to which parks and aquariums go, not only to keep their marine mammals healthy but also to save stranded animals. The film depicts the adaption of human medical technologies to enhance animal care -- working collaboratively with human medical specialists on creative solutions. Many more heartwarming examples have not made it to the silver screen. The accumulated knowledge, collective experience and resources of marine parks and aquariums are the primary factors in successful rehabilitation efforts of stranded dolphins and whales. Every visitor who walks through the gates of a marine park or aquarium is a partner and a major financial contributor to these educational, research, conservation and stranding accomplishments. These facilities count hundreds of millions of such partners each year and have earned overwhelming public support. ""Blackfish"" did not include a single individual to speak compellingly about the benefits of these activities. Much of what ""Blackfish"" chose to highlight is old news -- activities occurring decades ago that are as out of date as your grandfather's old black-and-white TV set. Like many documentaries aimed at persuading audiences to a particular point of view, ""Blackfish"" has no obligation to present a balanced narrative nor do the rules for documentary awards require a filmmaker to do so. Marine parks and aquariums that share these wonderful marine mammals with the public remain immensely popular because of their effective and important work to educate children and adults and to inspire wildlife conservation action. If you want your children to understand the vital importance of protecting marine mammals and conserving our environment, there is no better, engaging way to reach them than to see animals up close at an accredited marine park, aquarium or zoo.

"(CNN) -- West, Texas, isn't just a town. It's a family. That's why it hurt so much one year ago Thursday when an enormous explosion at a fertilizer plant claimed 15 lives while destroying 120 homes and damaging 200 others across 37 blocks, shattering windows well beyond that. The blast was earth-shattering, registering on seismographs as a 2.1-magnitude earthquake and shaking homes 50 miles away. The 10-foot crater the blast left behind pales in comparison to the holes left in the hearts of the town's 2,800 residents. ""No one's life was untouched,"" says Mimi Montgomery Irwin, owner of the Village Bakery, a local gathering spot. Everyone felt the blast: Those who buried loved ones and the neighbors who consoled them. The displaced students learning Shakespeare in trailers because their schools were condemned. Homeowners left without a home and the friends who took them in. Mayor Tommy Muska is ""not surprised at all"" by how his community came together. Some might attribute this spirit to the resiliency of the Czechs who helped settle and still help define the community. Others may credit the strong faith of its residents. Or it may be a product of life in a place where everyone knows everyone and won't leave their neighbors behind. It's telling that, in a town of 2,800, very few left. ""(Residents) pulled themselves up, shook themselves off and started moving forward."" Muska says. ""They just did what needed to be done."" Thanks to this hard work, this unity, these values -- not to mention well-placed, much-needed government assistance -- the mayor says, ""We're going to have a new normal someday."" But that day isn't here. And the old normal in West isn't coming back. Newly released video shows moment of deadly blast . War zone now a construction zone . Still, the evidence is everywhere that West is rising again. It is happening brick by brick, shingle by shingle, prayer by prayer. What once looked like a war zone is a construction zone. Already, 25 new homes are finished, with about 60 others nearing completion, according to the mayor. A new emergency services facility has replaced a tiny construction trailer. Work has begun on rebuilding the West Rest Haven, a nursing home and once one of the town's biggest employers. Downtown storefronts, which last year had boarded windows, are bustling with business. ""We can see something happening,"" says Dr. George Smith, West's director of emergency medical services. ""There is light at the end of the tunnel."" The view was hard to envision that fateful Wednesday night last spring. Smith was in West Rest Haven, where he is medical director, when the building's ceiling and windows collapsed on him. Somehow, he and the facility's residents were able to escape. The very next morning, city officials, including the mayor and several council members who themselves had been left homeless, went to work. Nonprofit groups from the Red Cross to faith-based groups to volunteers who just wanted to help flocked to the small town. In the three days after the blast, the Texas A&M Veterinary Emergency Team treated more than 120 animals -- horses, sheep, chickens and a cow and her calf in the field, household pets like dogs, cats, rabbits, even a bearded dragon -- says spokeswoman Angela Clendenin. Twelve months later, authorities still haven't pinpointed the cause of the blast, but an electrical malfunction, a spark from a golf cart or an intentional act haven't been ruled out. For now, the state fire marshal's office and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives will only say their joint investigation ""is active and ongoing."" While nothing publicly has changed on the investigative front since May, the status of federal assistance took a big step forward in August when President Barack Obama's administration issued a disaster declaration that paved the way for funding for things like new infrastructure and millions of dollars for new schools. When they open in fall 2015, those new school buildings will be better than what they replaced. There will also someday be a park and memorial. The 120-bed nursing home is expected to be state-of-the-art. New infrastructure and homes likewise will be improvements. As Smith notes, ""In the long run, we're actually going to be better"" as a town in many ways. Muska concurs, while in the same breath adding: ""Anything we get as a benefit for this is too much a price to pay for the 11 firemen, two civilians who helped out and two civilians killed."" Loss of lives hits small town hard . In a community full of strong people, the mayor said among the strongest are the 13 women who lost their husbands. ""They are doing as well as can be expected,"" Muska says, acknowledging that Thursday's memorial may reopen some of the wounds. ""It's not going to ever go away. The sting of losing a loved one radiates long after they are gone."" Adds Montgomery Irwin, whose bakery specializing in kolaches and other Czech foods is a frequent meeting place for residents, ""Time does heal. But you don't forget."" Even with reconstruction abounding, she adds, ""From an emotional standpoint, it seems like it was just yesterday."" Some say the tragedy contributed to more than the initial loss of life. West Rest Haven's residents dispersed to about 10 facilities after the explosion, leaving their friends and caretakers behind. Over the past year, these elderly people died at about twice the rate that would have been expected, Smith says. ""People ask me if it had anything to do with the explosion,"" he says. ""And I say, 'Yes, it certainly does.'"" The loss of the nursing home didn't just affect its residents. Emil ""Sonny"" Fridel, 91, misses his almost daily trips to visit friends at West Rest Haven and misses the weekly masses there, according to his daughter, Mary Ann Kubacak. A reunion a few months ago cheered up the nursing home's former residents, as did the recent groundbreaking on the new facility. Their feelings are similar to many others displaced by the blast, Smith says: ""Most of them want to get back to West as soon as possible."" Ray Snokhous lost two cousins, both firefighters, in the explosion. A lawyer who returned a decade ago to West, where his father had been the town blacksmith, Snokhous says, ""It's difficult to put into words"" how his and other families are able to rebound emotionally. But reflecting on the town's history of settlers who fled oppression in Europe and of sending men like himself, a Korean War veteran, to serve in the U.S. military, Snokhous said the people of West have shown their resilience time and again. ""We're survivors,"" said Snokhous, who is the Czech Republic's honorary consul general in Texas. ""And we are also fighters. ... God gives us a wake-up call every so often, and we respond to it."" 'We will put it back together' Residents say their faith has been instrumental in understanding and dealing with last April's tragedy. Montgomery Irwin says the anniversary falling so close to Easter -- with its message of resurrection and renewal -- is especially appropriate for the people of West. Snokhous lauds not just his own Catholic church, but churches of other denominations that helped heal the mourning community. ""What I have seen is a community come together like (one) could have never imagined,"" he says. ""... We have the blessings of the life remaining. And we will put it back together."" Whoever one talks to, that word -- community -- comes up again and again. Notes Kubacak, who grew up in the town and still visits regularly, ""The people of West have always helped each other."" Montgomery Irwin was living and working in New York, where she was a vice president in Macy's marketing division, after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The scale of the destruction and suffering was immense, but even then there were many people in the city who didn't know anyone personally affected. That's not true for West, to which Montgomery Irwin returned seven years ago after her father's death. It's still a place where everyone seemingly runs into each other every day, be it at her bakery, the supermarket, the hardware store or church. A lot of people don't readily complain or ask for help, but they now more than ever realize their neighbors will open their doors, wallets and hearts when it's needed. What's most different now is that, through this terrible tragedy, people the world round have gotten to know West. It's not just a town on the east side of I-35, a dot on the map between Dallas and Austin. ""People know now that West is truly a place,"" says Montgomery Irwin. ""And actually, quite a special place."" CNN's Jason Morris and Jessica Ravitz contributed to this report.","15 died, hundreds of homes destroyed or damaged in West, Texas, blast last April .

"(CNN) -- About 300,000 people are now estimated to be internally displaced in Kyrgyzstan by ethnic violence, the U.N. refugee agency said Thursday, citing information from the Kyrgyz interim government and non-governmental organizations. Families and host communities were sheltering many of them, but at least 40,000 people were in need of shelter, according to the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. The violence between Kyrgyz and Uzbeks in southern Kyrgyzstan has calmed down after it erupted late last week. The UNHCR saying as many as 180 have died and around 1,900 have been injured. The agency said the situation in Osh and nearby villages ""appears to be volatile"" and conditions in Jalal-Abad are tense. Many families have left from Osh and Jalal-Abad for Bishkek and other areas. UNHCR and other U.N. humanitarian agencies are working to get supplies into the region. Internally displaced people are those who have left their homes but remain inside their country, and refugees are people who have fled the country. As for Kyrgyz refugees, Uzbekistan has been providing assistance and shelter to an estimated 100,000 people who've fled there, a flight that has strained the health care and food sectors of Uzbekistan. Several dozen female refugees crossed the border pregnant and have given birth, the United Nations said. The United Nations said it is assessing the situation for refugees now, and Elisabeth Byrs, spokeswoman for the U.N. Office of Coordination for Humanitarian Affairs, said an appeal for help will be issued soon. China, meanwhile, said it had removed 1,299 Chinese nationals across Kyrgyzstan's eastern border into China, the state-run news agency Xinhua said. The Chinese government chartered nine flights to bring its citizens from Osh to Urumqi, capital of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region over a three day period, Sun Dali, a spokesman for the foreign ministry, told Xinhua. Some Chinese nationals chose to remain in Kyrgyzstan, Sun said.","NEW: Nearly 1,300 Chinese nationals evacuated to China .

"(CNN) -- The Soma mining disaster is already the deadliest industrial catastrophe in Turkey's history. Yet Turks are unable to grieve for the appalling loss of human life. Utter shock and fury are the overriding public sentiments against the brazen lack of humility and sense of responsibility displayed by those in positions of power, both in the government and private sector. But Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's scandalous attempt to justify the death of more than 280 miners by pointing to mining disasters that occurred in France, Britain and the United States more than a century ago reveals more than the worldview of a ruthless politician with a skewed sense of chronology. It also exposes Turkey for what it has become: a grim 21st-century Dickensian dystopia, where a new class of political and business elite grows rich and powerful on the back of cheap labor and expendable lives. The comparison with 19th century Europe is hardly superfluous: worker's rights have been systematically weakened and are routinely violated in Turkey since the 1980s, to the extent that the country was ""blacklisted"" by the International Labor Organisation (ILO) in 2008. Trade unions, once powerful and influential, have been emasculated and seen their ranks dwindle. Over a million subcontracted workers in the public and private sector are without job security, deprived of their right to join unions and participate in collective bargaining. Cheap labor and weak regulation make Turkey an attractive destination for industrial production and fuel the country's construction sector, which has been driving growth over the past decade. Yet they also come with a terrible price tag: the ILO ranked Turkey first in Europe and third in the world for fatal work accidents in 2012. Coal mining is among the deadliest of professions. According to a 2010 report by the Turkish think tank TEPAV, the ratio of deaths to production capacity in Turkey was five times the figure for China and 361 times the figure for the U.S., two of the world's leading coal producers. An overwhelming majority of the work related deaths are caused by poor working conditions, inadequate training and a general lack of job security, and are thus preventable. Erdogan seems to disagree. ""Dying,"" he declared following an explosion that killed 30 workers at a Zonguldak mine in 2010, ""is the fate of the miner."" In Soma, he casually suggested that accidents were in the nature of this work; they were ""usual things."" As he spoke, his normally animated face remained calm and expressionless, devoid of any visible sign of remorse or empathy. He accepted no responsibility, including for his party's rejection of a parliamentary proposal by the opposition CHP only three weeks ago to investigate a string of past accidents and deaths at the very mining facility in Soma. It would appear that Erdogan views such ""accidents"" as unfortunate but unavoidable side effects of Turkey's rise as a regional power under his leadership. After all, no empire is built without the blood and sacrifice of the nation, whose ""will"" he claims to embody and grandeur he seeks to restore. As in Britain and France at the turn of the last century, tales of imperial glory constitute a central part of the ruling AKP's populist discourse. And in a country that is deeply divided along identity issues, especially along the secular versus religious fault line, such discourse has powerful appeal. But even Erdogan cannot sustain his tremendous popularity through nationalist propaganda and perpetuated feelings of social resentment, if he and his aides continue to dismiss the plight of ""his people"" and respond to their ultimate sacrifice with kicks and punches. In this regard, the Soma disaster may turn out to be a watershed moment. Numerous times in recent years, the government's security apparatus harassed those who were experiencing unspeakable agony for having lost loved ones, some at the state's own hands. The families of those killed in an airstrike near the Kurdish village of Roboski in December 2011, in the terror attack in Reyhanli in May 2013, or during the anti-government protests across the country since last June have been deprived of their right to grieve and forced into a continuous state shock and outrage. But these were mostly poor Kurds, Alevis or secular Turks, who are unlikely to support Erdogan's party. In Soma, on the other hand, the AKP is popular. It carried the town comfortably both in the general election in 2011 and the municipal election held in March this year. And it is here that the AKP's headquarters have been ransacked, and the prime minister hackled and called on to resign by furious residents. In Huxley's Brave New World, ""soma"" was the hallucinogenic substance used by the state to induce a feeling of contentment and happiness among citizens. It remains to be seen whether in Erdogan's Brave New Turkey, Soma will have the opposite effect.","Karabekir Akkoyunlu: Disaster exposes Turkey as 21st-century Dickensian dystopia .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Friday that he regrets the deaths of 35 civilians in a military airstrike in a Kurdish area on the border with Iraq. Speaking to reporters in Istanbul, he said, ""It is an unfortunate outcome. It is a sad outcome."" Pledging a full investigation, he said those killed late Wednesday were smuggling cigarettes and fuel, with almost half of them below the age of 20. Erdogan said Turkey's military had been monitoring the area because it was in constant use by terrorist groups and that security forces had become suspicious because of the size of the group and number of donkeys used. The funerals of the victims, who all came from three villages in the Uludere area of Sirnak province, should now have been conducted, he said. His words came a day after a senior member of a Kurdish separatist group urged Kurds to rise up against Turkish authorities over what he called a massacre. Bahoz Erdal, a member of the command council of the armed wing of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, issued the call for action on the group's official website. ""We urge all the people of Kurdistan, especially the people of Hakkari (province) and Sirnak, to react to this massacre and seek a settling of accounts through uprisings from the perpetrators of this massacre,"" Erdal said in a statement. Some observers have sounded the alarm in recent months about escalating tension between Turkey and its Kurdish minority, warning it may reignite a conflict that has simmered since 1984 and claimed more than 30,000 lives. Turkey has been going on the offensive against Kurdish separatists based across its border in northern Iraq with bombings and incursions. Erdal dismissed comments made by the Turkish military general staff Thursday, however, as having ""nothing to do with reality,"" saying the attack occurred inside Turkey, not in northern Iraq as the general staff said. The general staff statement said the airstrike late Wednesday was in the Sinat-Haftanin area of northern Iraq, where many militant training camps are situated and there are no civilian settlements. Surveillance by unmanned aerial vehicles showed a group moving from Iraq toward the border with Turkey in an area ""mostly used by terrorists,"" it said. Erdal disputed that claim, saying the strike by Turkish air force jets was 30 kilometers (19 miles) away from Sinat-Haftanin in Uludere, in a Kurdish-populated area of Turkey. ""We do not have any camps, bases, activity or movement in the area as claimed. This massacre is an attack against our patriotic people of Botan,"" he said, using the Kurdish term for the Sirnak area. Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said Friday that Turkey did not discriminate between its citizens, only between civilians and terrorists. ""Every citizen is so valuable for us,"" he said, quoted by the semi-official Anadolu news agency. He described Wednesday's airstrike as an ""exceptional incident"" that should be investigated according to the law. Turkey's President Abdullah Gul also said the incident was unfortunate, Anadolu reports. A senior member of Turkey's governing Justice and Development Party (AKP) also said Thursday that indications were that those killed were civilians smuggling cigarettes. ""These people were thought to be terrorists; however, the first initial investigative information we have from the local authorities, especially from Sirnak Governor's office, indicate that these people are involved in cigarette smuggling,"" said the AKP's deputy chairman and spokesman Huseyin Celik. He said the strike had killed many members of the same family. ""Even if there was a situation 100% that these people were smugglers, these people should not have been subjected to this, they should not have been bombed. It is out of question,"" he said. Celik promised a full investigation into the incident. The general staff statement released Thursday said the military had received intelligence that militants were planning to attack border outposts following recent action against Kurdish separatists. In October, an attack killed 24 Turkish soldiers in the southeastern section of the country, where Turkey borders Iraq. The Turkish government blamed terrorists for that attack, and the United States pinned responsibility for the attack on militants from the PKK. Earlier this month, Turkish police detained dozens of people in a wave of raids focused on pro-Kurdish media organizations. The Kurds represent the largest ethnic minority in Turkey. For decades, they were the target of repressive government policies, implemented by officials who sometimes referred to them as ""mountain Turks."" The PKK is designated as a terror organization by Turkey and the United States.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Retirement terrifies sports stars. The end of a glittering career can feel like falling off a cliff to an athlete who thrives on fame and fortune. And the longer the career, the harder the end game seems to be. For living legends, it's especially tough to know how to quit. World heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield turned 50 this year -- but he still wants to box professionally. ""I'm not retired,"" he says. ""If I can get a championship fight, I will."" He won't fight just anyone, though -- only top boxers. Because he holds five heavyweight titles, he tells CNN that young boxers could want to challenge him just because they have something to prove. Holyfield can still draw a crowd, nearly 30 years after his professional debut. During a recent visit to CNN Center in Atlanta, fans swarmed him, taking pictures and shaking his hand. Holyfield: I want to be a heavyweight champion again . ""I keep myself right at the (professional) level, in case somebody feels froggy and says, 'I think I'm going to whup the old man,'"" he says. ""And they'd be shocked."" He says he trains every day, so that he always feels ready to fight at the top level. But Holyfield also faces a fight outside the ring: He lost his Atlanta-area mansion to foreclosure in 2012. So he understands the perils of quickly rising from modest means to riches -- then back again. He is trying to get his financial house in order. He recently took a sales role with Primerica, a financial services company. Holyfield sees it as an opportunity to teach others how to manage money. ""When I was 21 years old, I was a millionaire,"" he says. ""You're talking about a guy making $8,000 a year, working 40 hours a week, made the Olympic team, went to the Olympics, two weeks later -- a millionaire."" When Holyfield signed his first million-dollar contract three decades ago, he had been working three jobs that together earned him less than $10,000. ""It was just all of a sudden,"" he says. ""I came into boxing, I made big money."" But getting used to big swings in the bank account isn't the only challenge celebrity athletes such as Holyfield face. They also have to learn how to live without the constant cheer of the crowds once they're out of the spotlight. CNN PROFILES: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's 'giant steps' Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, 65, was one of the world's most famous basketball players. He remains the record all-time scorer in the National Basketball Association. He still has to duck to get his 7-foot, 2-inch frame through most doorways. But when he retired as a player in 1989, after 20 years of professional play, he was at a loss. He told CNN: ""The first training camp that I missed, I was like, 'Jeez, what am I going to do now?'"" He quotes another sports legend -- Jackie Robinson -- to describe how he felt when he retired. ""He said that athletes die twice,"" Abdul-Jabbar said. ""You know, when that first career is gone, that's a death."" That adjustment was harder for Abdul-Jabbar to process than his cancer diagnosis in 2008. He has chronic myeloid leukemia, a blood cancer that he manages with drug therapy. ""I think that (retirement) was the more difficult adjustment because you don't know what to do,"" he said. ""I'd had this incredible career."" But when he started to cultivate his talents off the court, he discovered a new calling. Now, he says, he wants to be known for his writing -- not just his basketball prowess. Faster, stronger, longer: Olympians live longer than the rest of us . ""I always tell people I can stuff a basketball into a hoop, but I also have a mind,"" he said. He has written seven books, including one for children, that focus on contributions from African-Americans to U.S. culture. Inspiring young people to pursue paths in science, math, engineering and other disciplines beyond professional sports is a passion. Because of his reputation as a famous athlete, his advice resonates with young fans.""It's really important that young people get ... that there's more to their life than sports and entertainment,"" he said. Abdul-Jabbar also works as a paid spokesman for Novartis Pharmaceuticals, which makes Tasigna, the drug therapy he takes to manage his CML. He says this role exposes him to a new fan base. ""People come up to me now and start talking to me about someone in their family, or a friend, or a loved one that has some type of leukemia."" He said the experience has opened up a new world to him. Sports psychologist Jack Llewellyn says that very few professional athletes want to think about coming to the end of their careers while they're still playing. ""As a consequence, very few of them are prepared for that next chapter."" Finding a passion off the court while she was still playing in major tournaments helped Martina Navratilova. The tennis superstar, now 55, played professionally well into her 40s. She said that after retiring, ""you become irrelevant really quickly."" But because she never defined herself solely through tennis, she was able to accept the transition. ""My sense of self-worth did not depend on winning matches,"" she said. Navratilova still is committed to keeping fit: she runs with her dogs, skis, cycles and plays hockey. ""And of course, I play tennis."" Navratilova serves as fitness ambassador for AARP, which she says she loves. And she wrote ""Shape Your Self: My 6-Step Diet and Fitness Plan to Achieve the Best Shape of Your Life."" Her advice to other athletes, professional and amateur? Play a new game when you get older. ""Find another sport that you can really improve at, that you can get excited about, and have fun,"" she said. Athletes can still satisfy their competitive drive, without comparing their current game to how they used to perform when they were younger. Shaquille O'Neal tweets that he's retiring . Like Navratilova, Kevin Willis played professionally much longer than most others in his sport. His career with the NBA stretched into his 40s. But he still didn't want to retire. ""If it wasn't for the simple fact that I'm older, I would (still) be playing,"" he said. He finally stopped because he says he didn't want to wear out his welcome. Willis spent half of his prolific career playing for the Atlanta Hawks. The president of the team, Bob Williams, acknowledged that most NBA athletes don't want their playing days to end. ""It's hard to give up the adrenaline rush,"" he said. He noted that Willis is exceptional in carefully orchestrating his next step after the NBA, and other players could follow suit. ""He's leading by example,"" Williams said. Willis already had a post-NBA pursuit lined up when he stopped playing for good five years ago. He started a clothing brand, Willis and Walker, back in 1988. It caters to men who are 6-foot-3 inches and taller, a demographic the 7-footer understands very well. Speaking from his boutique in Atlanta, he told CNN: ""The relationships that I built over those 21 years from basketball, I tapped into ... to help me build this."" His clients include former and present professional athletes. Having two decades worth of NBA earnings helps Willis to finance the endeavor. He says he has poured more than $1 million of his own money into the brand. Willis turned 50 this year, but he can still carry his weight -- and then some. He says he can still bench press 315 pounds, just as he did when he played professionally. But now, instead of lifting one set of that weight, he completes five sets of five or six repetitions. ""And how did that happen?"" he said. ""I don't know, man. It's just in the genetics, I guess."" Without the rigors of the NBA game schedule, Willis has more time to train -- and to reflect on his recent milestone birthday. ""That's a lot of life,"" he said of turning 50. ""And I'm always thankful for a lot of stuff, but when you reach that milestone, it's like: 'Wow!'""","Heavyweight boxing champion Evander Holyfield says he hasn't retired .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The United States on Saturday removed North Korea from its list of states that sponsor terrorism, State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said. ""Based upon the cooperation agreement North Korea has recently provided ... the secretary of state this morning rescinded the designation of the DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] as a state sponsor of terrorism, and that was effective as of her signature,"" McCormack said. McCormack said the United States and North Korea had reached agreement ""on an number of important verification measures"" of North Korea's nuclear program. These include participation by all members of the Six Party Talks, the role of the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency, access to all of North Korea's nuclear facilities and what procedures would be used in the verification process. ""Every element of verification that we sought is included in this package,"" McCormack said at a news conference. A senior State Department official said earlier that President Bush made the decision Friday night to remove North Korea from the terrorism list.  Watch how North Korea escaped the terror list » . The official said verification of North Korea's statements about its nuclear program will start right away, and the North Koreans will immediately reverse actions they have taken in recent weeks to restart their reactor and reprocessing facilities that produce plutonium for nuclear weapons. The North Koreans are expected to make a separate announcement Saturday, McCormack said. McCormack said Japan had agreed to formalizing the agreement at the Six-Party level, although the issue of North Korea's abduction of Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 1980s has not yet been addressed.  See why North Korea was on the terror list » . President Bush spoke Saturday morning with Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso, telling him that the United States ""will never forget the abduction of Japanese citizens by the North Koreans,"" White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said. ""We will continue to strongly support Japan's position on the abduction issue and will urge North Korea to take immediate steps to implement the commitments it made this summer as part the agreement reached with Japan,"" he said. North Korea was added to the list of state sponsors of terrorism in 1988, the fourth country to be added. Cuba, Syria, Sudan and Iran remain on the list.  View details about the countries on the list » . Countries designated as state sponsors of terrorism are subject to limitations on foreign aid, a ban on defense exports and sales, restrictions on exports of ""dual use"" items -- those that could be used for defense or non-defense purposes -- and a variety of financial and other restrictions. In recent weeks, North Korea objected to the way the United States and its allies were proposing to verify that North Korea was revealing all its nuclear secrets. The question of removing North Korea from the terror list had been under intense deliberations in the Bush administration over the past several days, since the U.S. point man in the negotiations, Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill, had returned from talks in North Korea. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had talked by phone to her counterparts in China, Japan and South Korea, and according to a spokesman on Friday, she expected to talk to Russia's foreign minister in coming days. Speculation had been rising in Washington that the Bush administration would decide to ""de-list"" North Korea, despite fierce opposition from some of Bush's fellow Republicans. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida, the ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, issued a strongly critical statement after Saturday's announcement. ""While I am not surprised by today's decision, I am profoundly disappointed,"" she said. ""Given the regime's decision to restart its plutonium reactor at Yongbyon and actions barring access to the site by inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, it is clear that North Korea has no intention of meeting its commitment to end its nuclear program."" Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain put out a statement Friday opposing taking North Korea off the terrorism list. ""I have previously said that I would not support the easing of sanctions [against] North Korea unless the United States is able to fully verify the nuclear declaration Pyongyang submitted on June 26,"" McCain said. ""It is not clear that the latest verification arrangement will enable us to do so."" McCain's Democratic rival, Sen. Barack Obama, had a more positive view, calling North Korea's agreement to the verification measures ""a modest step forward."" But, he said, any failure on Pyongyang's part to follow through with its side of the agreement must be met with swift action. ""President Bush's decision to remove North Korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism is an appropriate response, as long as there is a clear understanding that if North Korea fails to follow through there will be immediate consequences,"" Obama said. ""If North Korea refuses to permit robust verification, we should lead all members of the Six-Party Talks in suspending energy assistance, re-imposing sanctions that have recently been waived, and considering new restrictions."" Participants in the Six-Party Talks, besides the United States and North Korea, are South Korea, China, Japan and Russia.","N.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The ""crime scene cookies"", ""baaji custard"" and ""sponge shafts"" depicted in Oliver Beale's letter of complaint to Virgin Atlantic struck a chord worldwide. Mean cuisine? Airline industry experts insist standards of in-flight food are improving. The missive he sent to Virgin chairman Sir Richard Branson about a meal he received on board a Virgin flight from Mumbai to London in December spread across the web and email with a vengeance. Not only was this a complaint letter par excellence, but it hit upon one of the most emotive subjects of long-haul air travel: the in-flight meal. Read the letter here. ""Food gets everybody going, whether they are sitting at the back end or the front end of the plane,"" says Peter Miller, marketing director at Skytrax, a UK-based aviation research organization. ""Apart from the sheer fact you might be hungry, it is there to alleviate the boredom. Because of that people tend to focus on it more."" But the criticism passengers target at airline food is not always warranted, Miller argues. Skytrax has been tracking airline service for a decade and every year it ranks airlines according to catering in economy, business and first class. Miller acknowledges that there have been cut backs on catering across short-haul flights and a decline in spending on food in long-haul economy. But Skytrax's research has also revealed a general improvement in standards over the last five years. ""We are actually strong supporters of the overall quality that is served up across most airlines in most parts of the world,"" says Miller. Standards have improved firstly as a result of greater competition between airline catering companies, says Miller. What do you think? Are in-flight meals getting better or worse? What was your worse meal? Sound off below. Austrian catering company DO & CO has transformed the food served onboard Austrian Airlines and Turkish Airlines flights. Skytrax reported a 35 percent increase in customer satisfaction for Turkish Airlines since DO & CO was hired in 2007. ""In the last 15-20 years, the industry has focused on lean production. But we believe [airline catering] is not the job of a car manufacturer,"" says Attila Dogudan, CEO of DO & CO. Good quality airline food not only depends on the quality of raw ingredients, he says, but also the intangible elements of good cuisine. ""If you have chefs doing 3,000 filets on the grill, after 300 they lose the passion,"" says Dogudan. To inspire enthusiasm in its kitchens, DO & CO says it employs an unusually high ratio of chefs to work on a greater variety of dishes. They say they also insist on training cabin staff in food service; they replace the dreaded disposable food trays with crockery; and give passengers menus explaining where their fresh, local ingredients come from. Airlines also use food as a marketing tool and improve standards to attract premium customers. Austrian Airlines has won the Skytrax award for Best Business Class Catering for the last two years. As Michael Braun, spokesman at Austrian Airlines says, ""the current situation in the airline industry is tough and costs have to be cut. But the competition is also very tough, so we need something that makes us unique compared to other airlines."" And for Austrian Airlines, one unique selling point is its food. There is an on-board chef on every Austrian Airlines flight who puts the crucial finishing touches on premium-class meals. The airline also offers a ""Vienna coffee house in the air"" and one quarter of flight attendants are trained sommeliers to guide passengers through the extensive wine list. Airlines worldwide also hire celebrity chefs to add prestige to their culinary efforts. British chef, Gordon Ramsay is one of Singapore Airline's ""Culinary Panel""; Juan Amador works with Lufthansa; and United Airlines enlisted the services of U.S. chef Charlie Trotter to inspire its in-flight menu. Chefs help airlines design meals that perform at high altitude. As Michelle Bernstein, Delta's celebrity chef has said, palates weaken in pressurized air cabins, which means dishes need to be made a more flavorful and seasoned than they would be on the ground. Miller at SkyTrax is skeptical about the true benefits a celebrity chef can bring to onboard catering. After all, Gordon Ramsay isn't actually in the cabin sautéing the potatoes. But he does acknowledge that some chefs have influenced a new style of in-flight cuisine. Chef Neil Perry, hired by Qantas in 2003, initiated a move to healthy eating in first and business class. His work has since influenced standards across catering in all classes. Qantas won the Skytrax award for Best Economy Class Catering in 2008 partly as a result of simple enhancements such as the availability of fresh fruit between meals and from the self-serve bar in economy on its A380 aircraft. But as airlines grapple with a deepening recession, can passengers expect treats to vanish from food trays? Across short-haul flights, making cuts is an ""easier game,"" says Miller. Passengers notice it far less if an airline switches a sandwich for a packet of biscuits and a plastic cup of coffee, he says. But on long-haul flights, airlines are restrained in what they can cut. Miller: ""People measure the standard of their flight by the quality of the food or the size of the portion they get. If a meal is cut back too severely they are going to walk away."" How important is food for you on flights? Is it good enough? Sound off below.","In-flight food has been the butt of much criticism for the airline industry .

"New York (CNN) -- A confessed terror plotter calmly told a jury how he acquired the ingredients to make the bombs that he and his co-conspirators planned to detonate on New York subway trains during rush hour, killing many. If the attack was against the United States, then it was ""moral,"" Najibullah Zazi said Wednesday during his second day of testimony in federal court in New York. Zazi, the mastermind behind a plot to rig backpacks with explosives and blow them up on trains, is testifying this week against Adis Medunjanin, the only member of the trio on trial. During his testimony, Zazi detailed how he bought the chemicals from beauty shops and other ingredients from Walmart and Lowe's and then searched for crowded areas to detonate the explosives. Zazi, an immigrant from Pakistan, and Zarein Ahmedzay, an immigrant from Afghanistan, have already pleaded guilty to terror charges. Zazi said the group was trained in Pakistan by al Qaeda in 2008 and 2009 and then returned to the United States with instructions to attack. The group decided to detonate three bombs on a busy subway train during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, also around the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, Zazi said. He testified that one of his al Qaeda handlers told them the attack should send a message to incoming President Barack Obama to pull American troops from Afghanistan. But e-mails monitored by authorities may have helped to foil the plot. Prosecutors in court showed several e-mails they say that Zazi sent in which he asks a person in al Qaeda about a formula for a bomb. During cross examination, Robert Gottlieb, Medunjanin's attorney, tried to show that his client had had a falling out with Zazi before the plot was created. Medunjanin's trial is expected to last three weeks. Authorities widely regard the plot as the most serious al Qaeda attempt to launch an attack on American soil since 9/11. CNN's Kiran Khalid and CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank contributed to this report.","Confessed subway bomb plotter Najibullah Zazi testifies against alleged co-conspirator .

"Reyhanli, Turkey (CNN) -- Rage grew in a Turkish town on Syria's border Monday in the aftermath of weekend bombings as the government blamed Marxists with Syrian connections for the deadly attacks. Gathered before the ruins left when two explosive-laden cars went off Saturday, residents of Reyhanli called on Turkey's government to step down, alleging that it has gotten their country too involved Syria's troubles. Hours later, rescuers pulled another corpse from the rubble and placed it in a black body back for transit, said CNN Senior International Correspondent Ben Wedeman. It brought the death toll to at least 47. Another 100 or so have been injured, authorities have said. The Turkish government places the blame for the attacks on local perpetrators. ""For the time being, there is no evidence suggesting that al Qaeda was involved,"" Interior Minister Muammer Guler told Turkey's state news agency, Anatolia. The nine suspects in custody are all Turkish nationals, he said. Guler and other Turkish officials accuse a former Marxist terror group that they say maintains relations with Syria's intelligence services. The U.N. Security Council condemned the violence. ""The members of the Security Council reaffirmed that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security, and that any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed,"" a written statement from the Security Council said. Sunday anguish . Funeral prayers echoed across Reyhanli on Sunday. The families of the dead huddled under umbrellas in the town cemetery to lay their loved ones to rest, while others cried in streets still strewn with broken glass and twisted metal. Of the 50 people who remained hospitalized late Saturday, 29 were in critical condition, Guler said. Source: Patients from Syria being tested for chemical weapons . As they bury their dead and watch efforts to recover more bodies, local residents fear that more violence from the conflict raging in the neighboring country will spill over into the town. Some resent the flood of refugees that Ankara's generosity toward Syrians fleeing the violence has brought on. Turkey is trying to accommodate nearly 300,000 refugees from Syria's 2-year-old civil war, according to the U.N. high commissioner for refugees, and the attacks fueled anger at some of the Syrians who have taken shelter in Reyhanli. One Syrian trying to talk to CNN was stopped by two men on a motorcycle yelling, ""Don't talk to them"" and ""Go away."" They yelled at the Turkish man hosting Syrian refugees, ""How can you let them talk?"" One Reyhanli resident, Abu Marwan, said Saturday that people began grabbing sticks and ""going after Syrians"" in the aftermath of the bombings. ""We almost have more Syrians here than Turks, and people are getting angry,"" he said. Syria's information minister, Omran al-Zoubi, said the Damascus government was ""saddened"" by the deaths. But he denied that his country had any involvement and said Turkey was to blame for allowing rebel fighters -- whom Damascus dubs ""terrorists"" -- to operate from its territory. ""He added that the Turkish government has been facilitating the delivery of weapons, explosive devices, car bombs, money and killers into Syria,"" the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said of al-Zoubi. Turkey detains 9, alleges Syrian link to car bombings . Blasts struck government buildings . The first blast occurred at about 1:55 p.m. Saturday at Reyhanli's city hall. A second, more powerful blast occurred in front of the post office. Marwan said the bombings left ""body parts everywhere."" ""Buildings and the walls of buildings are collapsed,"" he said. ""The windows, the cars, everything is burned around it, people are burned. So many injured. The scene is outrageous, may God grant us peace."" The blast drew swift condemnation internationally, including from U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who vowed that Washington will ""stand with our ally Turkey."" Syrian opposition group: Regime fires shells toward Reyhanli . The Local Coordination Committees for Syria, an opposition group, has reported that Syrian government forces had fired several shells in the direction of Reyhanli, which is in Turkey's southern province of Hatay. Several Syrians were among the casualties, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, another opposition group.

"San Diego (CNN) -- Smartphones have made it more difficult to separate work from personal lives. Corporate managers tend to embrace smartphones because they make workers constantly accessible, but the devices have proved to be a headache for the departments concerned with keeping data secure. Devices that transmit and receive sensitive business files should be locked down from being accessed by most third parties, experts say. And some companies are encouraging employees to keep their two worlds separate. Contrary to many workers' wishes, corporate-information chiefs would prefer they not harvest virtual farmland or fling angry avians on the same device they use to review their companies' financial documents. That's not necessarily due to worries over lost productivity (that's the boss's concern). Instead, technology departments fear that amidst all the innocent games and other applications a person installs, malicious software could sneak in and gobble up e-mails, files and contact lists. A solution may come in the form of new phones with split personalities. AT&T, LG and heavily financed startups are presenting their own takes on the concept. Each company is trying to sell companies on their wares so that they'll install the security packages on employees' phones. These security systems are primarily being designed for hardware that runs Google's Android platform. In addition to being the most popular smartphone operating system, Android is perceived as the most vulnerable to attacks because Google doesn't review apps before they are posted to its online store, like Apple and Microsoft do. Developers can embed their programs deep within Android's file system, unlike with competing software. A service introduced this week called AT&T Toggle separates an Android phone into personal and work environments, and the user can switch between the two. AT&T's stance is that -- much to the chagrin of IT professionals -- the bring-your-device-to-work trend is inescapable. And the Toggle concept is the natural antibiotic, said Glenn Lurie, the president of AT&T's emerging devices group. Toggle is based on work by Enterproid, a company that has taken venture capital from Google's ventures arm and from mobile-chip maker Qualcomm. Enterproid has said it plans to release a version for iPhone. For security-minded executives attending the wireless-trade group CTIA's enterprise conference this week in San Diego, Enterproid's concept has been a popular topic of conversation. Phone manufacturer LG has its own take on this, which Ki Kim, a vice president for LG Electronics' business-to-business unit, calls the ""dual persona."" It incorporates technology from VMware, which develops virtualization software that lets a worker access his office computer's desktop from home. ""Google continues to develop (Android) with a focus on a consumer market,"" Kim said. ""So far, data security has been a bottleneck."" Samsung is forgoing the dual-persona approach for now, but its Stratosphere, an Android phone for Verizon Wireless that hit stores on Thursday, is being marketed heavily to businesspeople, said Ryan Bidan, a marketing exec for the company. The Stratosphere is the company's first handset with a new set of security features that will probably make their way into other Samsung phones, he said. Bidan, who defected a few months ago from BlackBerry maker Research in Motion, said Samsung's position is promising, especially ""having come from RIM and being on the losing end of the bring-your-own-device trend,"" he said. ""We've been very consumer-focused,"" Bidan said of Samsung's business. However, ""we want to make it easy on the (chief information officers)."" This split-personality approach to phone usage hasn't caught on yet, but security experts see it as a promising alternative to asking workers to carry around BlackBerrys in addition to their personal cell phones. Many companies favor RIM for their work forces because the company handles the message encryption on its own servers. The downside of that approach is that when RIM's servers go down, as they did this week, so does a company's access to mobile data services. For RIM's competitors, perhaps there is no better time than now to try to shift big corporate buyers to a new platform, where reliability along with security will be a major selling point.","Software makers are looking to solve security issues in Android .

"(CNN) -- North Korea has launched a vitriolic attack on South Korea's President Park Geun-hye over comments she made about the country's nuclear program, accusing her of ""blabbering"" like a ""peasant woman."" At a nuclear security summit in The Hague Monday, Park warned that North Korea's nuclear devices could end up in the hands of terrorists, and said that a nuclear meltdown at the country's main nuclear complex in Yongbyon would be more devastating than Chernobyl. In response, a North Korean official said that if the president is serious about improving cross-border ties, she should ""have discretion"" and ""refrain from making reckless remarks."" The spokesman for North Korea's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea accused Park of violating a pact reached at a rare high-level meeting last month, that pledged to end ""slander"" between the two sides. The official accused the president of being a ""faithful servant and stooge"" of the United States, in an English version of the statement published on the website of North Korea's state-run KCNA news agency Thursday. Although that statement did not contain much of the colorful language reportedly used in an earlier version of the statement. ""Even if someone else wrote the dumb speech for her to read from, she should at least know what and what not to say,"" AFP reported the official as saying Thursday. ""She should realize she is no longer a peasant woman blabbering to herself in the corner of her room but the occupant of the (presidential office),"" the statement said. South Korea's government said the comments were ""deeply regrettable and lacking in the most basic etiquette."" The war of words came after North Korea launched two ballistic missiles into the sea off its east coast Wednesday, violating United Nations resolutions that prohibits Pyongyang from conducting such tests. The U.N. Security Council condemned the move Thursday and is considering an ""appropriate response,"" the council's president U.N. Ambassador Sylvie Lucas told reporters. South Korea's defense ministry believes the North Korean missile tests were in reaction to the sideline meeting between President Park, U.S. President Barack Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the The Hague's Nuclear Security Summit Monday, as well as ongoing joint U.S.-South Korean drills around the Korean peninsula. It's not the first time North Korea has resorting to name-calling against its southern neighbors. A previous attack on Park described the president and her government as ""made up of ignorant hooligans hell-bent on hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of (North Korea) and on eclipsing the bright sunlight.""","North Korea accuses South Korea's president of slander .

"VAVUNIYA, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- After visiting a displacement camp in Sri Lanka on Saturday and flying over the site of the last battle in the country's recently ended civil war, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called the sites ""appalling."" Internally displaced Sri Lankan watch through barbed wire during a visit by the U.N. secretary-general. ""I have traveled around the world and visited similar places, but this is by far the most appalling scenes I have seen,"" Ban told CNN. ""I sympathize fully with all of the displaced persons."" Ban called for better humanitarian aid after interviewing some of the people regarding shortages of water and medicine. Ban toured Manik Farm, a sprawling camp for internally displaced people in the country's north, days after Sri Lanka declared victory in a 25-year civil war against the Tamil Tigers rebels. About 250,000 to 300,000 people are refugees in the country, according to humanitarian groups and U.N. figures. Some in the camp have experienced fierce fighting in recent months, saying they did not believe at points that they were going to survive. ""I have seen the complete devastation here, and there must have been in the crossfire many civilian casualties. There simply must have been,"" Ban told CNN's Sara Sidner. The Sri Lankan government has said it doesn't believe many civilians were injured or killed in the fighting. While the war's end elicited celebrations in some parts of the country, humanitarian groups and the United Nations worry over those uprooted by the fighting. Ban arrived in the South Asian island nation Friday, saying he came to offer help and partnership. ""I hope my visit today can help begin a process of national recovery, renewal and reconciliation for all Sri Lankans,"" Ban said in a written statement issued Friday. ""That is why I am here."" Ban met with Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa and asked that humanitarian organizations be given unrestricted access to provide more aid to the displaced. The president seemed open to the idea, Ban said. Ban said earlier he would urge the government to expedite the screening and processing of refugees and ensure that displaced camps have adequate supplies of food, medicine and water.

"(CNN) -- This Sunday, my family will be among the 110 million people gathered in front of their TVs to watch the Super Bowl, and with ad revenue projected at $300 million, we can expect advertisers to be as outrageous as ever, with spots promoting junk food, alcohol and erectile dysfunction drugs and depicting violence, sex and gender stereotypes. This said, TV ads -- even during the Super Bowl -- might be the least of parents' concerns. Digital media has dramatically changed the advertising landscape, and includes immersive websites, ""advergaming,"" viral marketing, mobile ads, social media marketing and precise behavioral and location targeting. More than ever before, advertising and entertainment are inextricably linked. In many cases, the content is the ad, and this can be particularly confusing for children, who are less able to understand persuasive intent. Common Sense Media just released a research brief -- ""Advertising to Children and Teens: Current Practices"" -- to provide an inventory of advertising practices aimed at kids and teens and calling for research to quantify exposure and examine the effects. The report finds that the integration of advertising and content across so many platforms -- from product placement to online games and Facebook apps -- has made it much more difficult for researchers to measure the exposure and impact of advertising on kids. While traditional advertising and its effects on kids have been well researched, no one knows the impact of these new media platforms. The concern isn't just what products are sold to kids or what messages are sent to them, it's that new modes of advertising are insidious and particularly troubling for kids and teens, who are less able to differentiate advertising from entertainment and whose sense of self is still developing. What does it mean for a tween or teen girl to receive weight-loss ads, targeted to her based on her age, gender, location, the foods she likes and the topics she searches? We need to understand the impact of this type of advertising on young people, what it means for their consumption habits, self-esteem, and right to privacy. Kids are also becoming a critical part of the product-selling cycle, without being paid (or even knowing, in many cases). Even Super Bowl advertisers are relying on our kids in large part to spread the word for them. For example, Doritos' ""Crash the Super Bowl"" ad contest has been seeking votes all over the Web -- including the kids' game site Addicting Games -- where information can be collected, and where likes, shares and views are the new measure of success. And a young person's ""liking"" or ""sharing"" of a product may appear in their friends' newsfeeds as endorsements or testimonials. No longer can you simply hit the mute button or fast-forward through the Viagra ads. Millions of kids will be on phones and tablets while watching the big game and the ads they interact with on these little screens -- that might not even register as ads -- have far greater implications for kids' healthy development. Media and ad savvy is now an essential skill and it's imperative we teach our kids to view media critically -- to understand what's being sold and what methods are used to sell products. And we must call upon the research community to develop new methods to quantify and analyze the effects of advertising on young people, not just to limit what's negative but to have a better understanding of how to reach kids with positive messages. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Steyer.","Kids will see Super Bowl ads for junk food and booze, with violence, sex and sexism .

"(CNN) -- When we think of the perfect summer blockbuster, we think of action -- and July's ""The Wolverine"" will have more than enough, star Hugh Jackman says. The 44-year-old is back for another round as the ferocious mutant Logan/Wolverine, but James Mangold's take is somewhat darker than its predecessors. As the trailers have shown, the typically sly Logan appears to be in a pretty serious funk as he's haunted by thoughts of Jean Grey (Famke Janssen). When a man whose life he once saved summons him to Japan, the ageless mutant is presented with an offer of mortality as a so-called expression of gratitude. ""He's sort of interested in it, because if your life is not great and there is a lot of regret and pain, would it be great to live on and on?"" Jackman said of his character's dilemma. And yet, as Wolverine hints in the trailer, the time hasn't come where he has nothing left to live for. Fans are anticipating seeing the iconic ""X-Men"" character put up an intense fight against his foes -- part of which happens atop a bullet train, as previews have shown. ""The only bad thing about filming a scene on the bullet train is that the wind machines are so powerful that when you watch it back on the monitor, you're like, 'man, I got to get a facelift because there's just skin flying everywhere,' "" Jackman joked. ""When I was lying on that train, I would just get pushed back -- and a couple of times, I just fell off of the train."" But, as a guy who loves the ""popcorn element"" of summer movies, he knows those sorts of action sequences are what audiences are hoping for. ""Yes, ('The Wolverine') is a character piece, and I would say it may be a little darker in tone than the others, and it certainly feels a little different, (but) it's just as much fun,"" Jackman said. ""The action is probably in this is more inventive than we've ever had before."" CNN's Nischelle Turner spoke with Jackman about how he bulked up once again, his character's vulnerable side and why Wolverine makes a pretty solid wingman for a teen. CNN: Looking at you, the only thing I can say is, ""Wolverine is back!"" Hugh Jackman: He's back, and I couldn't be happier. I never in a million years would've thought (that) I'd still be playing this character (12 years later). It kind of really is shocking to me, but at the same time, it's such an instant gratitude, because I love this character. CNN: So you know him now, really know him? Jackman: I hope so. I feel like I do. I certainly feel proprietorial over him, and, you know, I have now read a lot of (the) comic books. Being someone who had never read the comic books, when I first heard about the audition, I was like, 'They want me to play Brian Maddox?' who is the lead of this Aussie rock band called the Uncanny X-Men. ... So I knew nothing. It's been a great ride. CNN: This picks up after ""X-Men 3,"" so we do know that Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) has met her demise -- but I've seen the trailers. She's there! Jackman: I don't want to give away too much. She is there in the way that loved ones are always there ... in a very real way, she's there. CNN: Is it safe to say that Wolverine, especially in this movie, is a little bit of a sensitive superhero? Jackman: He's certainly more vulnerable. CNN: He's a broken man, a bit. Jackman: Oh, yeah. I mean, Wolverine is the toughest superhero. I may be biased, but I think he's the toughest. He doesn't necessarily have the strongest powers on paper, but ... he's the one guy who you don't want to be on his bad side. In this movie, however, you kind of see the toll of that; we start with him questioning everything. His life has been dominated by pain, by regret, mistakes ... CNN: He loses the love of his life. Jackman: (He) loses the love of his life, (and) we've seen that impact. He's one of those people where whenever he gets close to someone, bad things tend to happen. So in a way, not only for himself but for the world, he decides to just completely go off the reservation and sort of deny who he is and be like a recluse. CNN: But there is something that's bringing him back . Jackman: There is something bringing him back. ... He just can't help himself, you know? I think the thing I love about him is, you know, he's reluctant, he doesn't want to get involved, he's not an idealist, but at the end of the day when there is an injustice, he can't help but rise to the occasion. CNN: He's such a great character. (Playing him) had to raise the cool factor by 20 million with your kids. Jackman: It does, yeah. Except now my son's turning 13, and he's like, ""you're really nothing like Wolverine, are you?"" CNN: Does he use that to attract girls? Jackman: This is very weird, but on some level, I'm kind of a wingman for my son, who's turning 13. This sounds very politically incorrect, but it's weird because most of the time, he doesn't want to talk about it with me. He doesn't talk about it much; he just wants me to be Dad. But I spotted him at the beach a couple years back, and he was talking to some girl who must have been 14 or 15. I was like, ""Hmm ... like father, like son."" And all of a sudden, he's pointing at me, and he walks over towards me. And he's sort of walking ahead of the girl, he's about 20 yards in front of the girl, and he's going, ""Dad ... Wolverine. Just give an autograph, will you?"" And I was like, ""OK."" CNN: You sealed the deal for your son! Jackman: For my then-11-year-old son! I know! If you see me in bars in about 10 years time, stop me! CNN: Does the process of bulking up ever get tedious? I mean, there's muscles everywhere. Jackman: I'll be honest with you, I kind of love it; I love the challenge of it. My personality is, 'I have to be in better shape than the last time."" ... I feel really blessed to have the role, and I want to do it better every time, and so for me, the physicality of Wolverine is everything. I've realized it's preparation, it's time. Like in some of the old movies, you could see I didn't have time to prep. And I'm 44 now, so I need the time. CNN: How much time did you spend getting ready? Jackman: Three hours a day. I had a mentor, Dwayne Johnson, the Rock. We're mates, and I said, 'Mate, I need to know what you do."" And he said, ""Tell me you've got six months? ... You need six months to do this."" He told me the diet -- 6,000 calories -- (and that) you have to train like no one else. CNN: What does 6,000 calories a day consist of? Jackman: It's six meals, with each meal having some kind of protein -- chicken, steak, fish, eggs -- a lot of it. Brown rice. If you're lucky enough, as you're bulking, you get brown rice or sweet potato. And then in the last month, I cut all the carbs out, and then it's a lot of steamed veggies. It's pretty plain, there's no salt, very little seasoning. And that's the big that gets hard. This is what I learned: When I started, I used to think, ""You want to be bigger? You want to be in better shape? Train harder, train harder, train harder!"" It's not not (that), it's the food. Seventy percent of the way you look is your diet, 30% is your training. So if there's anything you've got to concentrate on, it's the food. CNN: When you're done, what's the first thing you go for? Jackman: Lasagna, ice cream, desserts, pizza ... All that stuff. CNN: That's probably one of the happiest days of your life. Jackman: So good. I love it so much. I eat pretty much everything. ""The Wolverine"" opens in the U.S. on July 26.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Scientists think they have uncovered conclusive proof that human activity is responsible for rising temperatures in both polar regions. Changes in polar temperatures are not consistent with natural climate changes say scientists. Research carried out at the Climatic Research Unit at the UK's University of East Anglia (UEA) demonstrates for the first time that anthropogenic climate change is responsible for warming at the Arctic and Antarctic. Previous studies have observed rises in temperature at both poles, but none, until now, have formally attributed the cause to human activity. Using up-to-date gridded data sets, scientists led by the UEA observed mean land surface temperatures in the Arctic over a 100 year period. For the Antarctic the observation period was shorter -- 50 years -- as there is no station data available before 1945. They then applied an average simulated response using two models. The first examined natural forcings -- events like solar cycles and volcanic activity which can affect temperatures. The second model simulated natural combined with anthropogenic forcings -- which included greenhouse gases, stratospheric ozone depletion and sulphate aerosol. Scientists discovered that the observed changes in Arctic and Antarctic temperatures are not consistent with internal climate variability or natural climate drivers alone. One of the report authors, Dr Alexey Karpechko told CNN: ""In both cases the accelerations are not consistent with natural forcing, which means that natural forcing alone cannot produce such a warming. So in a sense, we can say conclusively that this [warming trend at the poles] is due to human influence."" The paper ""Attribution of polar warming to human influence"" is published in the science journal Nature Geoscience. The Antarctic data is of particular interest given that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fourth Assessment Report in 2007 notes that anthropogenic climate change had been detected in every continent except Antarctica. This new data appears to demonstrate that man-made warming is indeed happening on the continent as well. The report may go some way towards silencing climate skeptics who point to evidence that most of Antarctica has been cooling for some time. ""There is strong warming in the Antarctic peninsula,"" Karpechko said. ""But for several decades there has been a slight cooling of the rest of the continent. This slight cooling is due to circulation changes which are partly caused by ozone depletion. ""This is why there has been a bit of confusion as to what is happening in Antarctica. But we expect a recovery of the ozone layer in the future. We may also expect that the Antarctic warming trends will emerge more clearly."" Commenting on the study conducted by the UEA, Professor David Vaughan, a Glaciologist at the British Antarctic Survey told CNN: ""This is exactly the sort of study we need. The poles are extremely important in the climate change debate and the rapid warming in the Arctic is one of the icons."" Professor Vaughan, who is studying the patches of warming happening in Antarctica, concedes that the cooling that's occurred in the past 30 to 50 years is ""a little perplexing"". But he agrees with Dr Karpechko over the effects of the ozone hole. ""The likelihood is that over the next century the ozone hole will be substantially reduced,"" Professor Vaughan said, ""And it may mean that the Antarctic warming becomes much more apparent in that period."" Climate modeling might not convince everyone that warming is taking place, but as Professor Vaughan points out: ""Simulations are built around physical principles and an understanding of the physical world"". Climate modeling is a relatively new area of expertise but Professor Vaughan said that the UEA is widely recognized as one of the world leaders in this field. As previous IPCC reports have pointed out, the effects of warming at the poles are already being felt by indigenous polar species and communities. This new report is confirmation of the culpability of humans in contributing to these rising temperatures. ""I'm afraid that there will always be people that don't believe that we are making all these changes,"" Dr Karpechko said. ""Some people are waiting for the science to say that a particular heat wave is caused by humans. But attributing specific effects to human activities is much more difficult than attributing global changes. I don't know if we should wait for that because it will be too late. ""I see from the data that there is warming. This is really frightening.""","Scientist claim to have uncovered proof that polar warming is influenced by humans .

"(CNN) -- Plaid feels right for this fall, when the wooly weave of Scottish tartans is likely to show up on store shelves. It appeared in the fall runway collections of designers like Marc Jacobs, Michael Kors, Louis Vuitton and Tory Burch. It's no surprise: From Chanel's famous tweeds to Alexander McQueen's voluminous gowns to Tommy Hilfiger's preppy sportswear, the interplay of colors and crossing lines in a tartan weave allow designers to communicate a range of emotions. Think of the outrageous punk statements from Vivienne Westwood or the staid, aristocratic panache from Ralph Lauren. ""You can expect to see plaid on just about everything,"" said Jasmine Snow, the accessories editor for Seventeen Magazine. While stores are always filled with plaid in the fall, she said, this year, coats, long pencil skirts, shoes and already otherwise-printed shirts are getting the plaid treatment for crowds of all ages. ""Red and black buffalo plaids are the hottest right now,"" she said, and teens especially will be looking for unique plaid combinations for the once-again trendy grunge look. But then again, plaid has been on trend for a long, long time. Plaid's long history . In fact, it's been around since at least 1500 BC, according Patrice George, an assistant professor of textile development for the Fashion Institute of Technology. That's the age of the oldest surviving piece of plaid in the world. ""As soon as people learned to weave, they figured out that if you put different colored yarns in the two directions the yarn went, you got an interesting crossing (pattern),"" George said. ""Color combinations became associated with power and status. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the Scottish highlanders really developed this into a system, and that's where we get the tartan concept."" Tartan is a plaid woven in wool, designed in Scotland that identifies different clans, aspects of Highland society and political allegiance. Centuries ago, Scottish men used yards of tartan to wrap around their bodies, keeping them warm on the windy mountainsides. That piece of woven wool was called a pledd -- it's where the word plaid comes from, George said. Modern Americans often use ""plaid"" and ""tartan"" interchangeably, she said, although ""plaid"" is also the word for a check weave that's not an official tartan. But fashion designers and plaid enthusiasts have Queen Victoria to thank for its popularity, said Patricia Campbell Warner, a historian and University of Massachusetts Amherst professor emerita. Because Queen Victoria was so enamored of Scotland and Scottish tradition, she adopted tartan in her own clothing, and made it quite formal, Warner said. The bold blacks, reds, blues and greens used in many clan tartans today come from the Victorian era, she said, when chemical dyes became widely available. Before then, tartans were made from naturally dyed wool, which is drab in comparison. ""What Queen Victoria did, people copied,"" Warner said. ""Tartan went into high fashion with women's dresses from the middle of the 19th century, on."" Fashion has always followed the ""trickle-down theory,"" Warner said: When the highest echelon of any society does something, everyone else follows. And nobody copied Queen Victoria's penchant for plaid better than the Americans, Warner said. An American tradition? Americans are known to look to Europe for fashion inspiration -- it's an old habit. In colonial times, Americans were well connected with their families in Britain. It took only six weeks to get to the colonies by boat, Warner said, and the latest fashions and fabrics were often sent to American women by their relatives. As the United States and Canada grew, Americans of Celtic heritage helped to establish tartan's place on the continent. During the late 1880s, one Scottish immigrant trader was known to share his clan's tartan with Native Americans in exchange for buffalo hides, said George of the Fashion Institute of Technology. The pattern of red and black check (which became a favorite of lumberjacks, cowboys and hunters) was a big hit, she said, and soon became known as ""buffalo plaid."" The Pendleton Company in Oregon was also responsible for the homogenization of tartan and plaid in the United States, she said. Around the turn of the last century, the wool weaving mill served people living in the West, who mainly wore plaid shirts and leather pants during the frontier development of the 1880s and '90s. Pendleton ""started weaving traditional Scottish plaids but then they also started making up their own,"" George said, using ""more American"" colors like browns, golds and greens. Pendleton plaids went on to became associated with genteel country lifestyles -- say, a weekend in Vermont or a gentlemanly ranch in Montana. The very idea of a tartan has also left footprint on North America. Many U.S. states, branches of the military, universities and institutions have their own tartan. National Tartan Day, a holiday dedicated to Scottish-Americans, is celebrated on April 6. You can make your own tartan on the Web and it will be internationally recognized as such. There's even a museum dedicated entirely to tartan in Franklin, North Carolina. Jim Akins, who proudly claims Scottish heritage on both sides of his family, spends his retirement volunteering at the museum. He enjoys pointing out examples of his family tartans to visitors. ""People see me in a kilt and they automatically think, 'OK, he's Scottish,' but when this voice came out,"" he said, of his thick Southern accent, ""you could see the surprise on people's faces."" He regularly wears a kilt to church or even shopping with his wife. ""I think it's great that people would wear tartan, regardless of whether it's a shirt or a kilt,"" he said. ""It's the most comfortable garment that you'll ever wear.""","Many fashion designers incorporated plaids into recent fall and winter collections .

Vivino, M.D., associate professor of clinical medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and chief of rheumatology at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center, in Philadelphia. ""A lot of patients look a lot better than they feel."" How well are you managing your RA? Take a test . In Sjögren's, the white blood cells attack moisture-producing glands. The most common symptoms are persistent dry eyes and dry mouth, but the syndrome can lead to complications including extreme fatigue, joint pain, and problems with the kidneys, lungs, liver, pancreas, and central nervous system. Health.com: 12 nice things you can do for someone in pain . Because the symptoms are similar to those of many other conditions, Sjogren's is difficult for even the most experienced doctors to diagnose. It often takes years for a patient to receive a diagnosis after first experiencing symptoms. Elite athletes like Williams are no more or less likely to come down with the syndrome, but they may be more likely to receive an earlier diagnosis. ""An elite athlete might notice symptoms sooner,"" Vivino says. ""When you're running around huffing and puffing, your mouth is more likely to dry out sooner. Another important symptom -- fatigue -- will slow them down and affect their performance. And if they develop joint and muscle pain [that] persists, that leads to further testing to try to figure out what's wrong."" Health.com: Pain relief for athletes -- what works best? There is no known cure for Sjögren's syndrome, but symptoms can be managed with both over-the-counter products like artificial tears and sugar-free lozenges and prescription immunosuppressive drugs. The condition disappears suddenly in about 5% of cases, but the majority of people have lifelong problems. That doesn't necessarily mean Williams is done with tennis for good. ""Most manifestations are treatable and in most cases we can restore people to healthy and productive lives,"" Vivino says. ""Whether we can return an elite athlete to competition, that's another story, but we do feel the treatment makes a big difference.""

"New York (CNN) -- Two workers were rescued more than 550 feet above the streets of midtown Manhattan on Wednesday afternoon after their scaffolding buckled near the top of the Hearst Tower, the New York Fire Department said. The agency's chief of special operations told CNN the workers, who spent 90 minutes dangling near the top of the building, suffered ""no immediate medical incidents."" William Seelig said firefighters cut through a double-paned window on the 45th floor and brought the workers in through the newly created hole. It took about 30 minutes for authorities to cut through the glass and send a firefighter onto the scaffolding to assist the workers. Moses Neslon, a paramedic who attended to the men, said one was in his 20s and the other was in his 40s. They were smiling throughout the whole ordeal, he said. ""All this for us?"" one of the men jokingly asked him. The firefighter who helped guide them into the building, Tom Gayron, told reporters it wasn't especially windy, despite the height. He said the workers stayed calm as he helped them. Seelig said the scaffolding, which bent sharply near the middle, was secured and passers-by on the street were in no danger. The workers were doing building maintenance, another fire official said. The Hearst Tower is 46 stories tall and is the global headquarters of the 126-year-old media company. It rises out of a six-story Depression-era, Art Deco facade with landmark status. The original design was for a skyscraper, but construction came to a halt when the Great Depression hit. In the latter half of the 20th century, a commission approved a plan to add on the modern skyscraper while preserving the original facade.","The two workers were performing maintenance on the Hearst Tower in New York .

"(CNN) -- He racked up two within the space of a month in 2008, but six years on Padraig Harrington will once again find himself watching a major from afar. The two-time British Open winner's frustrating 2014 continued Monday after he failed to qualify for the U.S. Open for the first time in 15 years. Harrington was unable to advance from the 36-hole qualifying event at Walton Heath's New Course, falling six strokes short after recording rounds of 75 and 71. The disappointment follows on from the 42-year-old's failure to qualify for the Masters for the first time in 14 years last month, with his five-year qualifying exemption from his 2008 U.S. PGA Championship win having expired. ""The damage was done in the morning with that 75,"" Harrington told the PGA Tour's official website. Harrington felt his unfamiliarity with the New Course played a part in his downfall. ""[I] just made a few mistakes in not knowing the golf course and I was never comfortable with the pace of the greens, as there was a number of three-putts thrown in there,"" he added. Harrington's recent setbacks are all the more remarkable given that in 2008 he secured his second British Open title, before adding a maiden U.S.PGA Championship just a month later. The Irishman's form has suffered a dramatic decline in recent years and he is still searching for a first win on the European Tour or PGA Tour since claiming the U.S. PGA Championship. Harrington, who revealed that he had undergone skin cancer treatment in February, has slipped to 214th in the world rankings. The six-time Ryder Cup player is now set to take a week's break before returning to the PGA Tour for the FedEx St. Jude Classic in Memphis, which takes place from June 5-8. Harrington's compatriot Shane Lowry, meanwhile, built on his second-placed finish at the European PGA Championship Sunday to finish top at Walton Heath. Lowry, who missed out to Rory McIlroy by a shot at Wentworth, carded rounds of 69 and 67 to secure his spot at the U.S. Open. It is the second time in five attempts that the 26-year-old has been successful at Walton Heath in qualifying for the tournament. ""It was really tough out there. I played okay and putted really, really well. I holed a lot of six to eight footers for par and carried a lot of momentum in from yesterday to get the job done,"" he told the European Tour's official website. ""I was three under this morning and this afternoon chipped in for eagle to get to five, so that got me going. ""I just tried to play steady from there and not lose my head. It was tough last week and then 36 holes in this weather was very tough. I'm looking forward to my bed tonight."" Meanwhile, two-time major winner Jose Maria Olazabal missed out on qualification after finishing alongside Harrington at two over. The 114th U.S. Open takes place from June 12-15 at Pinehurst Resort and Country Club.","Padraig Harrington fails to qualify for next month's U.S. Open .

"(CNN) -- The seersucker suit is having a moment. Recently worn by the likes of Jay Z, Kanye West, and Leonardo DiCaprio (as designed by Brooks Brothers in the movie ""The Great Gatsby""), seersucker has jumped out of its humble beginnings and into the modern dandy's closet. And if you think seersucker will make you look like Colonel Sanders, Trent Lott or some preppie named Biff, it's time to think again. The hip hop world and famous athletes are leading the modern seersucker movement, said Esquire's fashion market editor Nic Screws. Instead of wearing a frumpy seersucker suit, these men are tailoring their summer wear to show off their physique, she said. ""I think seersucker is always having a moment during the hot months,"" she said. ""The reason it seems like a trend is that menswear (now) has guys upping their game."" Men have become bolder in their fashion experimentation, Screws said, and are now willing to take on a fabric that is fashionably more advanced than chino or denim. This season's advances with seersucker include shoes, bags and belts, she said. Menswear ""is a lot more aspirational than it's been in a long time,"" she said over the phone from Esquire's 80th anniversary October cover photo shoot. Seersucker is one of a handful of fabrics -- like denim and jersey -- that has cultivated a distinctly American identity. Even though the fabric has ancient roots in Persia and India -- its name derived from a phrase that translates as ""milk and sugar"" -- it has been used to outfit men (and women) up and down the U.S. East and Gulf coasts for more than a century, according to Brooks Brothers' in-house historian, Kelly Nickel. In America, seersucker started out as a blue-collar fabric, used by service staff and factory workers to cope with soaring temperatures in and out of pre-air conditioned buildings. But an interesting social phenomenon happened in the 1920s, thanks to the advent of the seersucker suit, as popularized by Ivy Leaguers and high society men outfitted in Haspel and Brooks Brothers. Haspel of New Orleans lays a claim to originating the seersucker suit, circa 1909. Joseph Haspel had a business producing seersucker overalls for Louisiana factory workers at the turn of the 20th century, when he put his sewing skills into a practical and stylish suit. In a flamboyant sales pitch, Haspel wore his seersucker suit to the beach, jumped into the ocean and was dry by dinner, said his great granddaughter and current president of the company Laurie Aronson. ""We're the originators, not the imitators,"" she said. ""Haspel still does it best."" Brooks Brothers started selling seersucker suits in the 1920s, said Nickel. While the origin of the seersucker suit may lay with Haspel, Brooks Brothers is the one who popularized it, she said. Both companies' classic takes on the seersucker suit have left an indelible impression in this country about what a seersucker suit should look like. The most iconic image of the outfit comes in the form of Gregory Peck's turn as Atticus Finch in the 1962 film ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" While defending field hand Tom Robinson, Finch wears a three-piece seersucker suit in a hot courtroom. Aronson's grandfather personally fitted Peck in a Haspel suit for the role. That iconic look, said Screws, is all about nipping and tucking in the right places. ""It's about showing off your waist, having the right length, showing a little bit of sock, showing a little bit of ankle, making sure you have the right amount of cuff hanging out of your jacket,"" she said. The 1980s helped develop the association of seersucker with Northeastern preppies, said Nickel. The look emphasized seersucker in a pastel rainbow of colors, even as plaid, festooned with outrageously colored socks and polo shirts. Author Tom Wolfe's ""go to hell pants"" epitomized the brazen use of seersucker in this fashion movement. When Trent Lott organized ""Seersucker Thursdays"" in the Senate in 1990s, plenty of senators -- men and women -- joined in the tradition. Billy Reid, a Southern gentleman and fashion designer based in Florence, Alabama, prefers the classic approach. ""I prefer to keep it simple,"" Reid said. ""Solid shirts and subtle ties, belts and shoes that compliment not scream out. The seersucker is a enough to make your statement."" ""Seersucker is not something that whispers,"" Nickel said.","Frumpy, boxy seersucker is out, tailored seersucker is in.
Men are boldly experimenting in fashion, using seersucker in new ways .
Haspel and Brooks Brothers helped popularize the cool fabric ."
"(CNN) -- Former U.S. Open champion Michael Campbell is to miss out on an emotional return to Pinehurst after withdrawing from this year's tournament. The New Zealander, who won the 2005 edition of the grand slam on the North Carolina course, has pulled out citing personal and injury problems. Campbell explained that he had only just recovered from an ankle injury and had recently separated from his wife Julie. ""Sorry I have been off the radar since playing at the 2014 Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship,"" a statement on his personal website read. ""I have had some problems with a tendon in my left ankle that stopped me from playing for 2 to 3 months. The good news is that I am back swinging and now managing to play 18 holes. ""On a personal note, I have some sad news. Unfortunately Julie and I have separated. Our children remain our number one focus as we move forwards -- as parents first and foremost while remaining both friends and business partners. ""As I do not feel that I am either fully physically or mentally ready to play tournament golf at the highest level, after much deliberation, I have decided not to play in the BMW PGA Championship, the US Open or the events in between. ""I want to get back to my best and I believe this is the best strategy to achieve this."" The 45-year-old has endured a lean period since his 2005 U.S. Open triumph, all eight of his career wins coming in 2005 or before, but his is still one of the enduring major championship wins. Campbell only secured his place at the 2005 tournament after making a birdie on the final hole of a qualifying competition at Walton Heath in England. Then he held off the challenge of current world No. 1 Tiger Woods -- who was then at the peak of his major-winning powers -- to claim the title by two shots. He became the first Kiwi in 42 years to claim a major championship, and though he finished tied for sixth at that year's US PGA Championship his game rapidly deserted him. His third place at the Portugal Masters in October 2012 was his best finish since 2006 though he did record a handful of top-25 finishes in 2013. Campbell's win at Pinehurst gave him a 10-year exemption at the tournament, meaning 2015 will be the last year he doesn't need to quality, but he now won't be able to relive any of those fond U.S Open memories at Pinehurst.

"Washington (CNN) -- Another month, another weak jobs report. And don't expect Congress to do much about it anytime soon. With unemployment stuck above 8%, congressional Democrats and Republicans blasted each other Friday for blocking legislation that would help create new jobs and spark stronger economic growth. Both parties have a number of proposals on the table, but with the campaign now in full swing neither side expects anything to pass before Election Day. ""The president needs to stop betting on his failed policies and start working with Republicans to remove government obstacles to job creation,"" said House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. ""We've passed more than 30 jobs bills -- he should call on Senate Democrats to stop stalling them."" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, ripped the Republicans for deciding ""they would rather focus their energy on political grandstanding and empty, partisan exercises that will not create a single job."" Who's right? It depends on your point of view. Congress is not completely incapable of action. In April, for example, legislators passed the Jumpstart Our Business Startups -- or JOBS -- Act, which provides small businesses in need of capital with a range of options that were previously out of reach. The provisions are aimed primarily at helping fast-growing operations like biotech and tech companies. Last week, Congress cleared a $105 billion bill funding transportation projects for two years and preventing a doubling of the student loan rate. But most analysts believe growing campaign pressure and Capitol Hill's cavernous ideological divide will combine to make further legislative progress nearly impossible. Next week, the GOP-controlled House will likely pass -- for a second time -- a bill repealing Obamacare, the president's controversial health care overhaul. Republicans know the measure is dead on arrival in the Democratic-controlled Senate, but they're trying to score political points by keeping the issue front and center in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling upholding the law. Boehner has also promised votes later this month on a Republican tax reform measure and a bill to, in the speaker's words, ""curtail excessive government regulations."" Reid, meanwhile, is promising a vote next week on small business tax cut measure ""designed to reward hiring and provide incentives for payroll growth."" The bill, sponsored by Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, would offer substantial writeoffs for new equipment purchases while also extending new tax credits for payroll expansions. For their part, Obama and presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney both have a number of proposals on the table. Obama rolled out a $447 billion job growth plan last September, but the blueprint was never approved by either chamber. Democrats then broke the measure up into a number smaller parts -- including the JOBS Act. The strategy met with mixed results and now appears to have stalled. Romney's plan includes a 20% cut in marginal tax rates, a repeal of both the estate tax and Alternative Minimum Tax, and a cut in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 25%, among other things. He'd also repeal the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory reform bill and give a green light to complete construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, a project that splits Democratic labor and environmental groups, and has been put on hold by Obama. The bottom line as far as Congress is concerned, however, is that Obama embraces traditional Democratic stimulus ideas like expanding the public sector workforce, spending more on infrastructure, and pushing targeted tax cuts aimed primarily at middle and lower income families. Romney and his congressional allies hew to a more traditional Republican agenda of sweeping tax reduction and slashing federal red tape for domestic energy producers and others. Don't expect a divided Congress to give either side a win -- especially before voters go to the polls on November 6.","Democrats and Republicans blame each other for Congress's failure to pass a new jobs bill .

"(CNN) -- Voting in Egypt's presidential election will be extended into a third day Wednesday to allow citizens a greater chance to vote, election officials announced Tuesday in a move criticized by both candidates' campaigns. It wasn't immediately clear whether the candidates' complaints would have any effect on the decision by the country's election commission. The election, initially scheduled only for Monday and Tuesday, pits former army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi against Hamdeen Sabahy. ""We strongly denounce the (election commission's) decision to extend voting another day. Extending the voting period for no real plausible reason will open the door to possible vote violations and rigging,"" said Hussein AbdelGhany, a top adviser to Sabahy. The election commission extended the voting in part so that people living in areas away from where they are registered can return to vote, the state-run Middle East News Agency reported. No numbers have been released, but the move comes amid concerns expressed in Egyptian media that the turnout has been low. TV hosts this week openly criticized voters for not participating. At the few dozen polling places that CNN visited or drove by in the Cairo area this week, there were no significant lines of people waiting to vote. The move also comes after Egyptian Prime Minister Ibrahim Mehleb, late Monday night, declared Tuesday a public holiday ""in compliance to citizens' wishes,"" state TV reported. The decision was thought to be a move to increase turnout. Both campaigns said they filed complaints against the commission's extension. AbdelGhany said Sabahy would consider withdrawing from the race if his complaint was ignored. The election was called because then-President Mohamed Morsy was removed from power in July in a popular military coup. El-Sisi, who was army chief at the time, stepped down from his military post this year to run for president.","Both candidates object to extension, their campaigns say .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal took another big step towards a ninth French Open title Saturday while one of his chief rivals in his half of the draw Andy Murray hovered on the brink of elimination before play was halted in fading light. Wimbledon champion Murray and Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber were locked at 7-7 in the fifth and final set on Suzanne Lenglen. The British seventh seed will be ruing several lapses of concentration, seeming to have the match in his grasp when a break up in the fourth set and again in the decider. Each time Kohlschreiber, who won the Dusseldorf event last week, hit back and survived some nervous moments in the final game on his own service to keep the match alive. The pair will come back Sunday with the winner to face either home favorite Richard Gasquet or Fernando Verdasco in the fourth round. Gasquet trails . Verdasco led 12th seed Gasquet by two sets and it was 2-2 in the third set when their match was also halted in the gloom. Earlier, top seed Nadal dispatched Leonardo Mayer in straight sets 6-2 7-5 6-2 and has yet to drop a set, while his Spanish compatriot David Ferrer also went through in fine style against Italy's Andreas Seppi. Ferrer is a potential quarterfinal opponent for Nadal but first the four-time defending champion must get past fast-rising Serb Dusan Lajovic. Match of the middle Saturday at Roland Garros may well have been Gael Monfils' five-set defeat of Italian 14th seed Fabio Fognini. Ever popular Monfils prevailed 6-2 in the decider after dropping the fourth to love. Halep hopes . While the established order is, in the main, still on top in the men's draw, Simona Halep, a 22-year-old Romanian, is the highest surviving seed in the women's tournament. The fourth-ranked Halep was impressive again in a 6-4 6-0 win over Spain's Maria-Teresa Torro-Flor, but standing in her way for a quarterfinal place is Sloane Stephens of the United States. Stephens, 21, reached her sixth straight grand slam fourth round, the best record on the WTA Tour, with a 6-3 6-4 win over Russian Ekaterina Makarova. Stephens, who many see as a natural successor to Serena Williams, says she is more motivated at the big four events rather than regular tournaments. ""I just peak at four tournaments a year. Every other tournament just gets me ready for these,"" she told the official French Open website. Stephens next . Halep is determined to make amends for a defeat to Stephens the only time they have met. ""I played her in Australia a couple of seasons ago and she beat me very fast. Now I think I'm more prepared than I was then. I have confidence I can take revenge."" Former French Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova will be a representative of the ""old guard"" in the last 16, with the 28-year-old, a 100-1 outsider at the start of the tournament, emerging as a real threat. She battled to a 6-7 6-1 9-7 victory over Czech fifth seed Petra Kvitova, her 10th appearance in the last 16 at Roland Garros in 11 years. Ivanovic beaten . She will next play Lucy Safarova, who continued the string of upsets with a 6-3 6-3 win over 2008 champion Ana Ivanovic. Only one player from the top six of the rankings, Halep, is in the last 16, with seventh seed and 2012 champion Maria Sharapova favored by many to claim a second French Open title.

"(CNN) -- Divisions between sexes start with pink and blue clothes for babies, move into dance classes and football practice and later into single-sex book clubs and bowling leagues. Those divisions, for the most part, are accepted and definitely don't make headlines. That's not the case for a renowned golf course in the Deep South that's raising lots of questions about the relevance and fairness of exclusive, male-only clubs in the 21st century. Since opening in 1933, Augusta National Golf Club has not allowed women to join, although women can play as guests of members. But conversation swirled around the men-only membership policy at the prestigious Georgia club as it prepared to open the Masters Tournament on Thursday. IBM sponsors the tournament, and the club has always extended membership to the company's officers. But IBM's new CEO is a woman, Virginia Rometty. Critics have called on Augusta National to offer her its traditional green jacket. When it comes to the famed club -- and the dwindling number of exclusive men-only social clubs around the country -- it's not about enjoying the company of a single gender, critics say, and it's definitely not about golf. ""It really is ultimately about power, and Augusta National is a big symbol of the last bastion of male hegemony over economic issues, the place where big business deals are done among the biggest, most influential corporations in this country,"" said Gloria Feldt, author of ""No Excuses: 9 Ways Women Can Change How We Think About Power."" Men and women, boys and girls can still benefit from time apart, some critics say, but not when the separation deprives another group of influence. Even now, gender-restricted environments start early, when children join Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts or other gender-specific activities. K-12 education has seen a boost in single-sex schools since 2006, when the Bush administration relaxed regulations on how public schools could implement it. Single-sex programs help children explore their identities during developmentally crucial years, said Dana Edell, president of SPARK, a nationwide coalition of girls-only programs. ""Boys' and girls' experiences are different growing up. It's valuable to have spaces for both girls and boys to explore issues that are unique to their experiences,"" she said. But even in those environments, the lines are becoming blurry. Girls can participate in the Boy Scouts through its subsidiary group, Exploring, and a Girl Scout troop in Colorado allowed a 7-year-old transgender child into its ranks last year, although some later protested with cookie boycotts. Private colleges are moving away from single-sex education as historically all-girls schools join forces with male counterparts or align themselves with bigger universities, according to Lisa Maatz, director of public policy and government relations for the American Association of University Women. Adult civic organizations began to open their doors to women in the 1970s and 1980s after a series of lawsuits. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1987 that Rotary clubs could not exclude women. Most of the private mahogany-paneled city clubs of New York and Washington, opened membership to women after being sued, said Martha Burk, former chair of the National Council of Women's Organizations  A few men-only social clubs remain, such as New York's Racquet and Tennis Club, where a manager told CNN ""we don't respond to any questions"" before hanging up. Other private golf clubs such as Preston Trail Golf Club in Dallas and Burning Tree Club in Bethesda, Maryland, don't specifically say ""men-only,"" in their rules, but they only refer to men's clothing requirements and locker rooms. Richard Lapchick, director of the Institute for Diversity and Ethics In Sport at University of Central Florida, said men-only clubs are fading as professional sports embrace diversity, but change is slow. ""I think you're going to see less of them in the future, but unless someone puts the spotlight on a club, nobody is going change because they prefer things the way they are,"" he said. ""For two weeks, [the media] is writing about Augusta National, but for the other 50 weeks, the club's policy continues."" Augusta's chairman dodged the prickly issue of women's membership Wednesday, saying it was a private matter. ""Well, as has been the case, whenever that question is asked, all issues of membership are now and have historically been subject to the private deliberation of members,"" Billy Payne said. ""That statement remains accurate; it remains my statement."" Critics say Augusta and other men-only golf clubs are more than just places to tee off with the guys. They're places of business for corporate elite, where connections are made and deals are brokered. ""The no-girls-allowed rule keeps women from accessing that power where they can conduct business and rise in professional development and create their own power networks,"" said Veronica Arreola, assistant director of the Center for Research on Women and Gender at the University of Illinois-Chicago. The idea of golf clubs as power hubs has become so entrenched in corporate culture that women's groups have hosted clinics to teach the game to women so they can hold their own on the green, Arreola said. The same kinds of discussions aren't necessarily happening in women's book clubs or at the local Curves gym, the ubiquitous franchise marketed to women. ""Million-dollar deals are not going down at Curves, but they are going down at golf clubs,"" said Terry O'Neill, president of NOW, which has men on its board and among its membership. ""The world turns on human connections; when power brokers hang together, they do business together,"" Feldt said. ""It really is a big barrier for women to be excluded from a place like Augusta that is so well-known for being the source of power-brokering opportunities. That's really different from sweating side-by-side on treadmills."" Activists say the Augusta National controversy shows gender discrimination is taken more lightly than racial discrimination. ""If this was the first black male CEO of IBM, and he was not allowed to join, IBM would not even be considering remaining a sponsor or having any other executives in the club,"" said Burk, who made Augusta's policy a national issue in 2003. ""Because it's sex discrimination, they feel empowered to ignore that or treat it as a lesser evil."" Several states, including New York and California, have ""public accommodation"" laws that say no one can be excluded from private establishments that sell food to the public or show films, exhibitions or athletic teams -- or places whose operations affect commerce ""among the several states"" -- like clubs where business meetings over lunch might result in corporate mergers. Georgia, however, is not one of those states. ""Of course everyone is entitled to a peer group that they enjoy,"" Burk, who is also the author of ""Your Voice, Your Vote: The Savvy Woman's Guide to Power, Politics, and the Change We Need,"" said. ""That's different from keeping out people who are qualified and ought to be included in what is essentially a business club, for reasons that have nothing to do with anything except an immutable characteristic such as race and gender."" Because of its status in the corporate world, activists are watching closely to see where the controversy ends up. The implications of Augusta opening its membership to women are far greater than if Curves or the Junior League were to suddenly start courting men, said Feldt, author of ""No Excuses."" ""We'll know feminism has won the day,"" she said, ""when men are trying to beat down the doors to women-only organizations.""

"(CNN) -- Exploring the mysterious nation of North Korea just got a lot easier -- at least if you're Chinese. A new scheme has been announced that provides Chinese citizens with an (almost) hassle-free visa to North Korea within a day, specifically for cycling day trips. The trip, including the visa, costs around $50. Some 35 Chinese tourists embarked on the first short cycling tour on May 2. They cycled across the border from Tumen, in the northeast of China, and visited Nanyang City in North Korea before returning to China the same day. The group visited Nanyang train station, the Korean War Hero Martyrs Monument, a portrait of Kim Il Sung, The Tower of Immortality, attended a show and sampled local snacks from a small farm market behind Nanyang International Hotel. That hotel is where Kim Il Sung reportedly met Zhou Baozhong, a famous Chinese World War II general. The first trip took a little more than three hours. Zhao Xin, one of the cyclists on the trip, told Xinhua, China's state news agency, ""In North Korea, the food was pollution-free: vegetables, fish, eggs, they all tasted not bad. We had no worries eating there."" First look at North Korea's new luxury ski resort . Rise of North Korea tours in China . Tumen, part of Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in China's Jilin Province, is a popular border city for travel to North Korea. Travel to North Korea from China has grown recently, with North Korea approving more tour routes from some Chinese cities. About 10,000 Chinese tourists visit North Korea each year through organized tours, according to Xinhua. ""The biggest advantage of Tumen in cross-border travel to North Korea is the efficiency in organizing a visa,"" said Zhong Shi-jiu, the deputy mayor of Tumen, in an interview. ""If travelers register up front with related travel agencies in Tumen as well as Tumen City Tourism Bureau, then you can get a visa and your trip approved the same day you apply for one here."" That would make travel to North Korea easier than travel to Hong Kong, at present, for Chinese mainlanders. The trip isn't available to non-mainland Chinese travelers. Tumen also offers walking tours between the two countries. It recently relaunched a train service between China and North Korea's Mount Chibo.

"Montreal, Canada (CNN) -- A United Nations aviation agency agreed Tuesday that global airline flight tracking is needed in the wake of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370's disappearance and established a September deadline for ""near-term implementation plans for applicable solutions."" Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu, president of the U.N.'s International Civil Aviation Organization, made the announcement after officials from more than 40 countries met in Montreal to examine a framework for worldwide standards aimed at preventing similar mysteries. ""ICAO will continue to provide the necessary leadership to ensure all issues are considered expeditiously to enable a 'performance-based' International Standard for global airline flight tracking,"" Aliu said in a statement. ""As ICAO considers the requirements for global flight tracking, we will also be looking closely at the most effective means of sharing tracking data when needed with applicable search and rescue and accident investigation authorities,"" he said. Flight 370 has been missing since March 8 despite an international search. Global flight tracking is not a new issue, but there is new urgency as the global aviation community looks closely at more robust flight tracking in response to the disappearance of the Malaysia Airlines commercial airliner carrying 239 people. ""Public perception is that in a world where every move seems to be tracked, there is disbelief both that an airplane could simply disappear and that the flight data and cockpit voice recorders could be so difficult to recover,"" the International Air Transport Association said in a submission to the meeting. Flight 370, a Boeing 777-200ER, disappeared on a routine flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing. Its transponder went off and its maintenance reporting system stopped functioning. It lost contact over open waters between Malaysia and Vietnam. Radar is not reliable over the ocean or, as is possible in this case, at low altitudes. It's unclear whether the transponder -- a radio transmitter in the cockpit that works with ground radar to identify a plane's position, speed and direction -- and the maintenance reporting system, which transmits periodic flight data to the ground, were intentionally disabled or malfunctioned. The search for the plane is concentrated in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Perth, Australia. Damage to search vehicle . Meanwhile, the sole underwater vehicle searching for the plane was temporarily taken out of service because of damage, a U.S. Navy official told CNN. The tail section of the Bluefin-21 was badly damaged when it struck the side of the Australian vessel Ocean Shield in the last 24 hours. But the submersible has been repaired and probably will be redeployed when daylight arrives in the southern Indian Ocean, the U.S. Navy official said. The accident occurred when searchers, who were experiencing communications problems with the vessel, were hoisting the Bluefin to the deck to examine it, said Michael Dean, deputy director of ocean engineering for the Navy. ""They had 20-knot winds and 3- to 5-foot seas,"" Dean said. ""They got the vehicle on deck, but in the process of doing so, the vehicle was damaged. They essentially had torn the propeller, the tail section had ripped away, and so there was some damage back aft (in the area of) the main electronics bay. There were quite a few components that we had to troubleshoot. ""The good news is the vehicle is repaired,"" he added. Dean said the Bluefin was repaired with spare parts loaded on the Ocean Shield during its recent refueling trip to port. He said it is likely the team will wait until daylight before deploying the Bluefin-21 on its next mission. The vessel is ""probably more than halfway through"" searching the location of ""Ping 1,"" considered the second most likely place to find the wreckage of Flight 370. No wreckage was found during its search of ""Ping 2,"" considered the most likely location of the plane. During the mission in which it was damaged, the Bluefin-21 never reached the ocean floor, so no data was collected. Key topics for the ICAO . The key consideration at this week's ICAO meeting was developing protocols for tracking aircraft. The members listened to a brief presentation about several flight tracking technologies, but do not plan to prescribe a specific one. ""Let me also clarify that performance-based standards differ from 'prescriptive' standards in that they do not restrict operators to specific technological solutions,"" Aliu said. ""This systems-based approach acknowledges that what will best service airlines and manufacturers over the longer term will be the flexibility to choose from amongst the latest and most cost-effective innovations that meet their global flight tracking needs."" One potential standard could be preventing anyone from being able to turn the off flight tracking systems. This is not the first call for such international standards. Air France Flight 447 crashed in 2009 in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Brazil, killing more than 220 people. It took five days to find wreckage and nearly two years to find the underwater debris field. The French accident investigation board recommended that authorities ""study the possibility of making it mandatory"" for commercial airlines to regularly transmit basic flight parameters, including position, altitude and speed. The ICAO changed some standards after the Air France accident, which will go into effect in November. In what documents describe as ""initial steps,"" airlines were told to make better use of existing communication links, introduce mandatory warnings sent to air traffic control when a plane deviates from the cleared route, and improve procedures to ensure better connections. ""This was also identified as a low-cost solution, using existing (equipment) and technology,"" the ICAO secretariat wrote in working papers presented to this week's meeting. Now the organization is considering going further, mandating more frequent and more detailed flight tracking information. Separately, a satellite communications company proposed a free global tracking service ahead of the meeting. Inmarsat, the company whose satellite had the last known contact with Flight 370, said the service is offered to the 11,000 passenger aircraft already outfitted with an Inmarsat connection. It said the tracking would cover ""virtually 100% of the world's long haul commercial fleet."" Hunt for plane is the most difficult in history . CNN's Aaron Cooper contributed to this report from Montreal and Michael Martinez wrote and reported from Los Angeles.","A U.N. agency studies flight tracking technologies .

"(CNN) -- Rory Fallon scored the only goal of the game to help New Zealand qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1982 as they ran out 1-0 winners in their playoff with Bahrain. Bahrain had begun the Asia/Oceania playoff knowing a score draw would be enough to see them qualify and they had showed the early attacking intent at the Westpac Stadium in Wellington. But New Zealand -- nicknamed the 'All Whites' -- started to gain a foothold in the game and Leo Bertos and Chris Killen both struck the woodwork before Fallon grabbed the crucial breakthrough. The 27-year-old striker, who plays for English Championship side Plymouth Argyle, scored the decisive goal just before the half-time break when he headed home from a Bertos corner. Bahrain were handed a chance to level the scores in the 51st minute when Tony Lochhead fouled Abdulla Omar inside the penalty area and the referee pointed to the spot.

"(CNN) -- This Friday marks the 50th anniversary of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, one of history's most notable figures. Despite holding office for less than a full term, he has long been perceived by the U.S. public as one of the best occupants of the White House. Yet JFK's presidency is inspiring not just to Americans, but also to many others around the world too. And it offers key lessons for today, ranging from U.S. policy in the Middle East post-9/11, to how to best engage a ""rising"" China. At a time when U.S.-Soviet rivalry was becoming heavily militarized, JFK's political genius was to appreciate that the superpower contest was as much a battle for ideas as strength of force. Through his skilful rebalancing of hard and soft power, he powerfully renewed U.S. global leadership, helping to thaw the Cold War. Here his projection of hope and optimism, and stirring rhetoric appealed to U.S. and international audiences alike, including those behind the Iron Curtain. Landmark speeches included the one he made in Berlin in 1963 when he offered U.S. solidarity with West Germany. And his desire to re-set U.S.-Soviet relations was expressed eloquently too, including a compelling speech at the American University after the Cuban missile crisis. This was described even by Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev as the ""the greatest speech by any U.S. president since [Franklin] Roosevelt."" Renewal of U.S. international policy was not just rhetorical, as initiatives like the Peace Corps and the South America-focused Alliance for Progress underline. And, through landmark achievements such as the International Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, JFK gave substance to his ambition of moving toward international peace. To be sure, an objective appraisal of JFK's period in the White House must highlight lows as well as the highs. In addition to successes such as his management of the Cuban missile crisis, there was also the Bay of Pigs invasion debacle. And JFK had a much more limited record of legislative success than his successor Lyndon Johnson. Professional historians therefore tend to rate JFK's presidency as ""good,"" rather than ""great,"" with reason. Of course, the circumstances of today are transformed from those of the early 1960s. As well as the end of the Cold War, the United States has experienced relative decline: for instance, its economy now accounts for less than a quarter of global GDP compared to around a third then. Yet, the relevance of JFK's insights about international cooperation and peace endure. As does the wisdom of much of the way in which he harnessed U.S. leadership and power to try to achieve these ends. Indeed, at a time of U.S. military cutbacks, and given the ongoing information revolution, the importance of achieving better balance between -- often expensive -- hard power assets and soft power resources is perhaps even more important today for Washington. And this is true right across the world from Asia-Pacific through the Middle East and South America. On China policy, for instance, some U.S. hawks advocate a much tougher stance toward Beijing. However, as JFK would have recognized, Washington has much to gain from cooperation with Beijing too, and it would be a mistake to view the relationship solely through a lens of threat and suspicion. To be sure, there remains a legitimate remaining need for maintaining significant U.S. military power in Asia, not least to re-assure key allies. However, on issues ranging from North Korea, terrorism, through to the future stability of the global economy, China has a potentially key role to play in concert with the United States. Here the role of soft power is key as Washington seeks to better integrate Beijing into a network of regional and global institutions and alliances. In so doing, this will help incentivize China even more strongly toward a path of constructive partnership. In the Middle East meanwhile, U.S. standing in numerous countries has unfortunately been at a low ebb now for at least a decade. Only 11% of the population in Pakistan, 14% in Jordan, 16% in Egypt and the Palestinian territories, and 21% in Turkey, currently have favourable views toward the United States, according to Pew Global. Despite some U.S. overtures, the challenge remains monumental. This is such a critical issue given the wide-range of U.S. priorities in Middle Eastern and other Muslim-majority countries, including the ""campaign against terrorism."" As JFK would surely have appreciated, there is a compelling need for redoubling efforts to win the battle for moderate ""hearts and minds."" This can be best achieved through a vigorous re-assertion of U.S. soft power, combined with prudent use of hard power. Such an agenda would require much greater resourcing for activities such as public diplomacy, broadcasting, development assistance and exchange programs. U.S. public diplomacy is in particularly strong need of revitalization, with a clearer long-term strategy essential. Taken overall, it is clear that JFK's key insights about international relations retain much relevance and appeal. And for this reason alone, his presidency will continue to hold not just enduring value, but also inspiration, right across the world for many years to come. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrew Hammond.","Friday marks the 50th anniversary of the assassination of John F. Kennedy .

"(CNN) -- This isn't supposed to be happening. Not now, anyway. Nine confirmed wildfires have already burned nearly 9,200 acres in San Diego County. Southern California is no stranger to wildfires, but this many fires this early is a shocker. ""This is May,"" Carlsbad police Capt. Paul Mendes said. ""This is unbelievable."" Wildfires aren't typically a problem in California until the summer or maybe even the fall, when things get even hotter and drier. So what gives? The short answer is: A crippling drought and record high temperatures. In other words, it's bone dry and brutally hot. Add to that gusty winds -- and you have a potent mix. ""It's really awful, unprecedented,"" CNN meteorologist Jennifer Gray said. ""We have never seen California this dry before. So this wildfire season could be one of the worst in history."" Historic drought . California is in the midst of a long drought that has left it abnormally dry. How bad is it? This is how Gov. Jerry Brown put it in January: ""the worst drought that California has ever seen since records (began) about 100 years ago."" The exact financial impact of the historic drought in California has yet to be calculated. But the financial blow could be in the billions of dollars. Record heat . It's hot, hot, hot in San Diego County this month. San Diego and El Cajon experienced record highs of 93 and 99 on Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service. Thursday's forecast includes a heat advisory for the region, including temperatures up to 105. ""This is extreme. This has gone from dry conditions to volatile conditions,"" said one firefighter in Carlsbad, after using a torch to ignite backfire. ""This isn't something we don't normally see until November or September."" Gusty winds . The third factor compounding the situation: strong winds that are fanning the flames. ""The wind doesn't make it any easier,"" Carlsbad resident Marisa Gustafson told CNN affiliate KFMB. ""The wind can change and all of a sudden, it just seems like we're going to be safe and we're not."" Thousands of homes have been evacuated in Southern California. So have a nuclear power plant, a university campus and parts of a military base. Even Legoland, a popular amusement park, has been forced to close. Officials have issued some 23,000 evacuation notices in Carlsbad alone. And with nine fires burnings, firefighters are pooling their resources to try and gain control. ""This is only going to get worse,"" meteorologist Gray said. The skeptics' take . While investigators know what's keeping the fires burning, they haven't determined yet what caused them to flare up in the first place. So many fires, so quick, all of them separate -- that has some skeptical that only nature could be to blame. Among those confounded are San Diego County district supervisor Bill Horn who says he hasn't seen anything like this in at least 20 years. ""I'm sure it could be by chance,"" he said. ""I just think there's too much of a coincidence here."" What to know about wildfires . CNN's Andrew Spencer contributed to this report.","This many fires this early is a shocker .

"Qunu, South Africa (CNN) -- The coffin carrying Nelson Mandela's body arrived Saturday in his ancestral village of Qunu, where he'll be buried Sunday amid the lush green hills of his boyhood. After a plane carrying his casket touched down in Mthatha, the closest airport to Qunu, it was taken in a procession past mourners who lined the roads to his rural home. The mood among the crowd was a celebration of his life, as well as sadness for his passing. The nation's first black president had often said he felt most at peace here at his rural home in the southeastern corner of the nation. ""Look, he loved these hills,"" his daughter, Maki Mandela, told CNN in an exclusive interview. ""He really believed this is where he belonged."" His burial Sunday comes after 10 days of mourning. Before Mandela's journey home, the ruling African National Congress bid him farewell Saturday morning at an air force base in Pretoria. Members of the ruling party stood, bowed and prayed around his black, flag-draped casket. ""Icon of our struggle. Father of our nation,"" read a giant poster bearing a picture of a smiling Mandela. His wife, Graca Machel, sat in the front row, dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief. ""We will miss him, he was our leader in a special time. Go well, Tata,"" President Jacob Zuma said, using the Xhosa word for father. ""You've played your part. You've made your contribution. We'll always remember you."" Helicopters hovered overhead as soldiers carried the casket into the military plane. It then took off for Qunu -- followed by fighter jets. 'He really wanted to die here' Thousands of mourners lined the streets from the airport as Mandela's remains were brought to the remote village where he spent much of his childhood. Mandela relished his time at the village, which is marked by endless open fields and velvety grass. It's where he herded cows and goats as a child; where his relatives are buried at the family farm. ""Even when my father was in jail, he had the most fondest memories of Qunu,"" Maki Mandela said. ""And he really wanted to die here."" Intimate tributes . The Rev. Jesse Jackson, the U.S. civil rights leader, told CNN that Saturday was ""a day of painful celebration."" ""People are beginning to realize what they've lost, but they know they've got so much left,"" said Jackson, referring to the sweeping political and social change achieved by the anti-apartheid leader. ""They know what he left in place stays in place."" He was planning to attend Mandela's funeral Sunday, where the tributes were expected to be more intimate. The military handed over his remains to elders at his home. And, in a symbol of the return of one of their own, the national flag that had covered his coffin was replaced with a lion skin, a traditional symbol of the Xhosa people. At dusk, tribal leaders and men in his family held a private vigil to honor traditions of his native Thembu clan. His casket was to lie overnight in his bedroom, which overlooks the hills and his grave site. What to expect as Nelson Mandela is laid to rest . Small village, giant spotlight . Mandela died last week at age 95. Events leading up to the burial included a memorial service Tuesday followed by three days of public viewing at Pretoria's Union Buildings, where he was sworn in as president in 1994. About 100,000 people paid homage to Mandela during the three days he lay in state, government officials said. The airport in East London, south of Qunu, will be used for their arrival and departure of dignitaries, with access closely controlled. Thousands were expected to make the trip to Qunu for the burial, thrusting the remote village into the international spotlight. The guest list of foreign dignitaries included Britain's Prince Charles, talk show host Oprah Winfrey and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. A private family prayer service will be held Sunday morning at Mandela's home. The funeral will take place in a white tent set up at the family farm. The Mandela family, Zuma and the Cabinet members will be present along with local and foreign dignitaries. About 4,500 people are expected. The military will again be charged with draping the flag over Mandela's coffin. Members of the military will perform a salute, and play the national anthem. The burial . About 430 family and friends will walk to the grave site to say goodbye to the man many consider to be the father of their nation. Mandela will be buried in the rocky soil of his childhood home. The burial area has been built for him; some of Mandela's relatives are already buried there. Security . Zuma has authorized nearly 12,000 members of the South African National Defence Force to serve alongside the police force. A tight military cordon is expected around the funeral site. As South Africa prepares to bury Nelson Mandela, young Africans are optimistic about the future . CNN's Robyn Curnow reported from the Mandela compound in Qunu, Faith Karimi wrote and reported from Atlanta and Laura Smith-Spark from London. CNN's Kim Norgaard contributed to this report.","Nelson Mandela's casket arrives in Qunu, where he spent much of his childhood .

"Washington (CNN) -- Some conservatives unhappy with House Speaker John Boehner's leadership are looking for a replacement, and recent moves by Texas Republican Jeb Hensarling are fueling speculation he wants Boehner's job in the next Congress. Hensarling, who was part of Boehner's leadership team two years ago but left to chair the House Financial Services Committee, gave an expansive speech last week hosted by Heritage Action for America, a group that frequently and publicly clashes with Boehner. Asked afterward if he was interested in running for speaker, Hensarling initially said he was ""flattered,"" and said, ""It's not something I've aspired to. It's not something I'm thinking about."" But then he left the door open, saying, ""No, I haven't been Shermanesque, again I'm not sure there's any opportunity I want to foreclose."" While Heritage Action's Chief Executive Officer Michael Needham told CNN that his group doesn't get involved in leadership races, the conservative group gave Hensarling a high-profile platform to outline his own conservative philosophy for governing. Needham said there is a ""real need to take on sacred cows in Washington at time when the party too often looks after K Street,"" a reference to the downtown D.C. address for corporate lobbyists. He said, ""Jeb Hensarling is a great spokesman and fighter for conservative values."" Boehner has said he's staying put . Boehner, in his 12th term in Congress and in his second as speaker, continues to insist he's not going anywhere and expects to remain in charge next year. But he raised questions earlier this month when he wouldn't commit to serving out another full term as speaker. At the beginning of the current Congress in January 2013, a dozen House GOP members voted for someone other than Boehner, or voted ""present,"" an expression of no confidence. Many in that small group are convinced Boehner won't run for his post after this year's midterms or that he won't have the votes to keep that title. If Boehner decides to step down from the position, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor is popular among conservatives, and most expect him to move up and take the speaker's gavel. In that scenario conservatives could wage an effort to fill in top House GOP posts. Boehner on the establishment and the tea party . Multiple House Republicans -- some who voted for Boehner in 2013 and some who didn't -- praised Hensarling as a solid conservative, but also told CNN there's a short list of others who are viable candidates. Many House Republicans interviewed by CNN declined to talk openly about potential leadership challenges, but admitted there are informal discussions about options. The names repeatedly raised include Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, who like Hensarling is a former chairman of the fiscally conservative Republican Study Committee; Louisiana Republican Rep. Steve Scalise, who currently heads that group; and Georgia Rep. Tom Price, another former study group leader who also served in Boehner's leadership team in the last Congress. ""The one consensus point is that we'd like to see more conservatives in future leadership posts,"" Louisiana Republican John Fleming told CNN. But he cautioned for now there's no single alternative emerging to Boehner -- or anyone who might want to challenge the speaker's current top lieutenants -- Cantor and GOP Whip Kevin McCarthy. He said he expected more serious discussions to ramp up by the end of the summer. Hensarling's recent speech at Heritage may be a way to ensure his name gets in the mix. The Texas Republican used the speech to position himself firmly on the right. He called out his own party for breaking with its free market roots, arguing that the party should be shifting away from policies designed to help big business and the well-connected and instead champion policies to help the ""Main Street competitive economy."" The thrust of Hensarling's speech lines up with the message many on the right flank of the House GOP conference have been pushing. Idaho Republican Raul Labrador has publicly criticized House GOP leaders for pushing a legislative agenda that positions the GOP as the ""party of big business"" and doesn't resonate with small businesses and entrepreneurs. Challenging the party . Hensarling argued those on Main Street are ""not looking for a subsidy, earmark, tax preference or legislated advantage."" On a series of issues -- tax reform, farm policy, reform of mortgage giants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae -- Hensarling challenged his party to hold votes on legislation that would restructure current federal systems. The bulk of Hensarling's ire was directed at the Export Import Bank, the 80-year-old credit agency that gives out loans to companies to promote U.S. exports. The bank's lending authority is due to expire at the end of the year. Hensarling defended 2013 GOP shutdown strategy . Hensarling held it up as the poster child of corporate welfare, citing that the vast majority of its taxpayer backed loans go to companies like aircraft manufacturing giant Boeing. He said getting rid of the bank ""is a defining issue for our party and our movement."" If Hensarling or anyone else is serious about mounting a challenge, the Republicans that CNN interviewed all agree that if they are serious they need to move soon. ""It seems to me that the odds of there being some type of change within the leadership team seem to be more likely than less, and so as long as there are members talking about it it's better to do so early than late,"" Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King told CNN. North Carolina Republican Rep. Walter Jones, who opposed Boehner in the last election, told CNN that he hears from Republicans in his district that it's time for a leadership change in Washington. ""There is a great deal of frustration,"" Jones said. He wasn't sure if Hensarling or someone else was the right fit, but said a successful campaign required several months or preparation. A few months ago unhappiness about Boehner's handling of government spending fights and concern he would negotiate with Democrats on a major immigration bill roiled the conference. But because members aren't coalescing around a single alternative, the vacuum gives Boehner some job security for now. Fleming said tension is down between conservatives and Boehner because the speaker agreed to form a select committee on the deadly Benghazi terror attack and hold a House vote that held former IRS official Lois Lerner in contempt for the controversy around her agency's targeting of conservative groups. He said ""there are less things that divide us -- but the one question would be immigration.""","Boehner has been speaker since 2011 and has said he's not going anywhere .

"(CNN) -- The ire and angst accompanying Facebook's most recent tweaks to its interface are truly astounding. The complaints rival the irritation of AOL's dial-up users back in the mid-'90s, who were getting too many busy signals when they tried to get online. The big difference, of course, is that AOL's users were paying customers. In the case of Facebook, which we don't even pay to use, we aren't the customers at all. Let's start with the changes themselves. Until now, the main thing that showed up on users' pages was a big list of ""updates"" from all the friends and companies and groups to which they were connected. It was a giant chronological list that made no distinction between an article (like this one) that may have been recommended by a hundred friends and the news that one person just changed his relationship status or had a funny dream. Facebook has now prioritized that flow of stories into a news feed that puts ""top stories"" on top, and the more chronological list of everything down below. Top stories are selected by an algorithm of some sort that ""knows"" what will be important to the user based on past behavior and numbers of connections to those recommending the story, and so on. Meanwhile, as if to make up for this violation of the what-just-happened-is-the-only-thing-that-matters ethos of the social net, Facebook added a live, Twitter-like stream of everything everyone else is doing or saying. It runs down the right side of the screen, almost like CNN TV's awfully distracting and wisely retired ""news crawl."" On an Internet where everyone and everything are becoming ""friended"" to one another, such a division of the relevant ""solid"" bits from the topic stream of data points makes sense. After all, updates from your closest friends and favorite bloggers should take priority over those from some relative stranger you ""friended"" because he said he was in your fifth grade class and you didn't want to insult him. If everyone ends up connected to everyone, Facebook will have to make some distinctions or the service will be useless. But users are bothered by all this. On the simplest level, they don't like change, particularly when it results in making their free time more complex and stressful. Facebook was always a lazy person's friend and time waster. Turning into a dashboard designed to increase productivity and relevancy turns it more into, well, work. Of course, if they stopped and thought about it, they would realize that Facebook is work. We are not Facebook's customers at all. The boardroom discussions at Facebook are not about how to help little Johnny make more and better friendships online; they are about how Facebook can monetize Johnny's ""social graph"" -- the accumulated data about how Johnny makes friends, shares links and makes consumer decisions. Facebook's real customers are the companies who actually pay them for this data, and for access to our eyeballs in the form of advertisements. The hours Facebook users put into their profiles and lists and updates is the labor that Facebook then sells to the market researchers and advertisers it serves. Deep down, most users sense this, which is why every time Facebook makes a change they are awakened from the net trance for long enough to be reminded of what is really going on. They see that their ""news feeds"" are going to be prioritized by an algorithm they will never understand. They begin to suspect that Facebook is about to become more useful to the companies who want to keep ""important"" stories from getting lost in the churn -- and less useful for the humans. Ultimately, they don't trust Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg and are suspicious of his every move. By contrast, Apple founder Steve Jobs took away his customers' hard drives, Flash movies, keyboards and Firewire ports -- and yet consumers put up with the inconvenience and discomfort every step of the way because they believed that Steve knew best, and trusted that he was taking them somewhere better. Apple users pay handsomely for the privilege of putting themselves in the company's hands. Facebook does not enjoy this same level of trust with its nonpaying subscribers. That's because on Facebook we're not the customers. We are the product. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Douglas Rushkoff.","Douglas Rushkoff: Many upset by Facebook changes, but they are confused .
He says changes are about monetizing your information for company's paying customers .

"(CNN) -- The first day of voting in Egypt's presidential election was relatively quiet, state media reported Monday, though one man connected to a campaign was shot to death. Polls will reopen at 9 a.m. Tuesday for the last day of voting. Egyptians are choosing between two candidates: Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Hamdeen Sabahy. Egyptian Prime Minister Ibrahim Mehleb declared Tuesday a public holiday ""in compliance to citizens' wishes,"" state TV reported. The decision is thought to be a move to increase turnout. Public service ads, media campaigns and the electoral ads of the el-Sisi campaign stressed that voting is a patriotic duty. The election was called because Mohamed Morsy, Egypt's first freely elected president, was removed from power in July in a popular military coup. A man working for el-Sisi's campaign was fatally shot near Cairo on Monday, Interior Ministry spokesman Alaa Mahmoud said. Mohamed Fathy, 35, was getting out of a taxi in the village of Kerdassa on the western edge of Cairo when he was shot in the head by unknown gunmen, Mahmoud said. Fathy was active in the el-Sisi presidential campaign and was a member of the Tamarod political movement, according to a statement from Tamarod. Police are investigating, but Assistant Interior Minister for Information Abdel-Fattah Othman has said the slaying has nothing to do with the election process. Tamarod has blamed the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood group, which had held a small protest in Kerdassa earlier in the day. Abdul Mawgoud Dardery, a spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood, criticized the election: ""What you have in Egypt now is not democracy but a militacracy. ... What we have now is Mubarak coming back. Sisi is Mubarak version 2014, and that is the tragedy."" Mahmoud also said a bomb was detected and defused at the Ahmed Sayed I school polling station in Giza. Egypt's state-run news agency MENA reported clashes in a polling station at Umraniya district but said they didn't disrupt the vote. Beni Suef Security Director Ibrahim Hadib said that seven members of the Muslim Brotherhood were arrested for trying to disrupt the electoral process in that town, MENA reported. A number of people hurled Molotov cocktails at the headquarters of el-Sisi's campaign in the town of Hosh Issa. No material damage or casualties were reported, MENA said. The Sabahy campaign similarly reported disruptions. ""The day has sadly witnessed many violations observed, documented and announced by the campaign, led by banning Sabahy delegates from entering polling centers, collective voting, physical assaults against delegates and lawyers, let alone some cases of intervention by police and army forces,"" it said in a statement. ""The campaign hopes that these violations would not repeat tomorrow."" Opinion: Egypt's youth needs more than tinkering at the edges .

"(CNN) -- Funny. Sexist. Sassy. Awkward. Seth MacFarlane was referred to with all these adjectives and more after his gig as host of the 85th Academy Awards on Sunday night. The ""Family Guy"" and ""American Dad"" creator received mixed reviews for his singing, dancing and jokes, with Time TV critic James Poniewozik dubbing MacFarlane ""American Dud."" ""In the run up to Sunday's Oscars, ABC promoted the broadcast as: 'Finally! An Oscars the guys can enjoy!' What did that mean, exactly?"" Poniewozik wrote. ""Time for me to turn in my Guy Card, I guess."" Talk Back: Did Seth MacFarlane hit or miss at the Oscars? MacFarlane is known for his male-centric humor. He is the creator of Ted, a profane stuffed bear who, during his appearance as an Oscars presenter, begged to be let in on the post-ceremony celebrity orgies he had heard so much about. So was there much surprise that one of MacFarlane's opening numbers was a little ditty titled ""We Saw Your Boobs""? ""I'll limit my discussion of 'We Saw Your Boobs' to noting how, um, nakedly it put into relief a recurring theme in last night's ceremony: A defensive anxiety about the ascendant power of women (emblematized, later on, by the pairing of the statuesque [Charlize] Theron with the wee Dustin Hoffman as awards presenters),"" wrote Slate's Dana Stevens. 'Oscars 2013: 'Argo' all the way . According to The Hollywood Reporter, the Anti-Defamation League slammed the host for a joke made by Ted (voiced by MacFarlane) about Jews in Hollywood. ""While we have come to expect inappropriate 'Jews control Hollywood' jokes from Seth MacFarlane, what he did at the Oscars was offensive and not remotely funny. It only reinforces stereotypes which legitimize anti-Semitism,"" the ADL wrote in a statement, according to the Reporter. ""It is sad and disheartening that the Oscars awards show sought to use anti-Jewish stereotypes for laughs."" There were a few uncomfortable moments, such as a date night/domestic violence reference to singer Chris Brown and Rihanna that earned some groans. And you could feel the audience wince when MacFarlane tossed off, ""This is interesting. Daniel Day-Lewis not the first actor to be nominated for playing Lincoln. Raymond Massey portrayed him in 1940's 'Abe Lincoln In Illinois.' This is true. I would argue, however, that the actor who really got inside Lincoln's head was John Wilkes Booth."" After more than a hundred years, can a joke still be too soon? USA Today's review called MacFarlane's hosting performance ""self-indulgent,"" noting that ""Oscars fans have seen a lot over the years, but this may be the first time they've ever seen a host use the awards to audition for his own variety show."" Memorable moments from the show . The Atlantic headlined its story ""The Banality of Seth MacFarlane's Sexism and Racism at the Oscars"" and opened with a vignette of the host's brief introduction of Meryl Streep: ""Our next presenter needs no introduction"" before walking away. ""If only he'd kept his shut more frequently,"" they said. Ouch. But Tim Goodman from The Hollywood Reporter praised the Academy's choice and pointed out that it clearly knew MacFarlane would be a ""polarizing choice."" ""In fact, MacFarlane was relatively tame if you know anything at all about his canon, and he was respectful through and through,"" Goodman wrote. ""As a guy who can actually sing and has recorded a successful album (fueling more jealousy and backlash from his detractors), his pick was more spot-on than anyone gave the Academy credit for."" Even Jennifer Lawrence, who won an Oscar for Best Actress for her turn in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and was name-checked in the boob song, found the humor in it. ""I loved the boob song. I thought he was great. I thought he was hilarious,"" she said backstage. But the critics always seem to have the loudest voices, especially the one place you can hear them shriek the loudest: Twitter. Salon pulled some of MacFarlane critiques from the microblogging site, including comic Michael Ian Black's take: .

"(CNN) -- Accepting my diagnosis of multiple sclerosis was probably the most difficult part of my MS journey. However, it also helped me retake control of my life. For years, I was in denial that I had MS. I thought if I didn't focus on my MS, then maybe it would just go away. It took the Nashville flood in May 2010 for me to ""wake up"" and decide it was time to take responsibility for what is, and what will be, my life with MS. My Mom, my sister and I lost our home and almost everything we owned in the flood. When we were rescued by boat, we were given another chance at life. I realized then that things can be replaced, but life and good health are invaluable. The stress from the flood brought on a relapse of my MS, which I could no longer ignore. At that point, I decided to accept that MS is part of who I am, and that I needed to learn how to manage it in order to continue living my dreams. I believe it was God who gave me another chance at life with the flood rescue and I wasn't going to waste it. I was determined to show this disease who was boss and that I would not let MS define my life's journey! I wanted to show the world that MS looks different for everyone and that MS does not mean you have to give up on your dreams. A diagnosis with any disease can be overwhelming, scary and confusing. Before, I, too, was scared and worried about how the world and the music industry would look at me if they knew I had MS. Would they judge me and stop booking me to sing places? Would I be able to continue playing shows? Would the dreams I'd been working toward my entire life be taken from me? If so, what else would I do? I can't say life is a piece of cake. Occasionally I still get asked whether my MS will interfere with my professional or personal life, but I respond every day by doing what I love. Can I continue to play my shows? Ask my fans who are there with me when I'm on tour around the world or playing a local nightspot. Can I write my songs? Listen to my current CD. Can I live a full and happy life? Come see the home I rebuilt after the flood. This doesn't mean I live my life in a haphazard way without a plan. I have developed a strong network of support, starting with my family. After hearing some positive things about my local MS Society chapter, I also reached out to it for information and found a mentor who has grown into a lifelong friend. I've learned to manage my MS by keeping all my options open. I have a neurologist who helps me control my MS with a disease-modifying therapy and address any symptoms that may appear. I am also much more than my MS and I manage my life through diet, exercise and my faith. I have learned that I do not have to give up on my dreams. I do still have the challenge of educating those within my professional field that MS won't stand in the way of performing concerts or being with my fans. It's a challenge I face head-on every day. I will continue to stand up for myself and those with MS and show the world that as people living with MS we can still do what we want to do.","Julie Roberts is a country music singer with multiple sclerosis .

"(CNN) -- A lot of folks in Lexington, Kentucky, are hoping for a ""Christmas miracle"" for the city's, and perhaps the world's, most-arrested man. It's a dubious honor, for sure, but Henry Earl, 64, has become a sort of celebrity, especially among students and police in the city of 300,000. To many, the homeless gent goes by James Brown, after the ""Godfather of Soul,"" and can often be found singing and shaking his moneymaker for change to buy his next drink. Hence, the arrests -- which have topped 1,500, according to The Smoking Gun, which is owned by CNN's parent company. Earl was scheduled to appear in a Fayette County court Thursday for a probation revocation hearing after being arrested for alcohol intoxication last week, landing him in jail for his third Thanksgiving in five years. He also spent his 64th birthday there in October, The Smoking Gun reported. ""There was a period where we couldn't access his arrests. We think he has likely passed 1,600, but decided to play it safe,"" site Editor William Bastone said in an e-mail. The Smoking Gun has become a sort of de facto repository for Earl's arrest statistics -- the site says he's logged almost 6,000 collective days in jail, for instance -- and in September 2008 corrected a local television station that aired a report stating Earl had been arrested for the 1,000th time. Not so, the site reported. Earl had been arrested 1,332 times as of August 31, 2008. The station, it turned out, hadn't accessed the records before 1992, omitting 264 arrests in the 1970s and 1980s alone, The Smoking Gun said. (Full disclosure: CNN misreported the 1,000th arrest as well.) ""We have literally been following Henry Earl's arrest history (and collecting his mug shots) for more than a decade. We even devoted a page to him in our last book,"" Bastone wrote. ""We have continued to monitor his arrests and the days he has been incarcerated as a result of those collars."" Man about town . Lexington police and Fayette County jail officials say they can't confirm an exact number because their records go back to only 1992 (Earl began his arrest career in 1970), but Lexington police spokeswoman Sherelle Roberts says Earl has ""definitely"" been in handcuffs more than 1,000 times. ""It's a weekly, if not every-two-or-three-days thing,"" she said. ""He's never doing bad or illegal things purposely. ... He's just so highly intoxicated that he's posing a danger to himself."" Almost all of his arrests have been for alcohol intoxication, though there's the occasional criminal trespass, Roberts said. There have even been times when Earl was released from the Fayette County Jail in the evening, only to return by midnight. One anecdote -- and there are many -- places a fresh-out-of-the-clink Earl in a sandwich shop near the University of Kentucky campus, telling jokes and dancing for change, wrote commenter Douglas Hurt on The Smoking Gun website. ""We walked outside and he said he needed a place to go and looked around like he was looking for someone. Next thing I know is that a cop drives by and Henry says, 'Welp... here's my ride' and grabs someone's drink and throws it at the cop car,"" Hurt wrote. Lately, judges have started handing down harsher sentences, jail spokeswoman Jennifer Taylor said. She said some of Earl's sentences in recent years have lasted three months. He's been arrested five times this year, she said. In the past, when his sentences were shorter, it was common for Earl to rack up dozens of arrests in a year, she said. ""Most people on the streets of Lexington know who he is,"" Taylor said. A local band, the Dangles, even wrote a song about him a few years back. The chorus goes, ""So tell Henry Earl I wanna be his girl/He's the sanest guy in town and he can dance just like James Brown/Unlike the other boys around that made me cry."" Glimmers of hope . There have been signs that Earl might change his ways. In 2009, he attended an alcohol-recovery program for about five months before falling off the wagon a few days shy of his graduation, said attorney Stephen Gray McFayden, who represented Earl three times in 2008 and 2009. Earl was en route to getting an apartment and food stamp benefits, so McFayden was particularly disappointed when Earl snapped his spate of sobriety in April 2009. ""He was telling me how sorry he was. He was actually in tears,"" the lawyer recalled. McFayden took up Earl's case pro bono after deciding that the town dipsomaniac was an easy target for police officers looking for a quick collar. ""He just gets in the car in his handcuffs and rides,"" McFayden said of Earl, adding that when Earl gets in front of a judge, ""He pleads guilty in five minutes."" Earl, who began drinking in his teens when his adoptive mother died, may have a ""fear of being sober,"" McFayden said. Several people have tried to help him, including Fayette County District Court Judge Megan Lake Thornton, who allowed him to go to rehab in 2009 even though the statute calls for 90 days in jail. ""She gave us a lot of leeway to work with Henry. A lot of his successes in the past are due to her giving him chances in the first place,"" the attorney said. ""Most judges are thoughtful about how wasteful it is to put someone away for 90 days for being drunk."" Despite that Earl lists no one as next of kin in his booking records -- and McFayden said the only family of which he is aware lives in Georgetown, about 13 miles north of Lexington -- Earl once declined an offer to relocate to Pittsburgh so he could get away from the elements that draw him back to drinking. He likes Lexington and doesn't want to leave. ""The good thing is, he knows where stuff is. The bad thing is, he knows where stuff is,"" McFayden said. Sobriety on horizon? The attorney is holding out hope for a ""Christmas miracle,"" though: seeing Earl kick the booze habit for good. He's not the only one. Ginny Ramsey, co-founder of Lexington's Catholic Action Center, said she considers the ""very pleasant"" Earl a friend. He occasionally drops by the center for a bed or a bite to eat, but he's ""pretty independent,"" she said. ""You can't help but love him, I tell you. ... He's as honest as the day is long,"" she said. ""With Henry Earl, you're going to hear the truth."" She said Wednesday that she might give Thornton a call and offer to house him at the all-volunteer nonprofit center, where putting a roof over his head will cost $2.50 a night rather than the $80 a day the jail costs taxpayers. But, she concedes, ""until someone is sick and tired of being sick and tired, it's not going to work."" The center's staff was ""within an inch"" of getting him on the right path last year, but Earl told her, with a trademark smile on his face, ""I'm not ready,"" she said. Maybe this year, it'll take. ""I don't think it's going to take many more winters, and this one may be the one,"" Ramsey said. ""There's never going to be a time when I'm not going to find something, even if it's one of our couches, for Henry Earl.""","Henry Earl will go before a judge Thursday for his latest alcohol-related arrest .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- A judge sentenced a rogue FBI agent to 40 years in prison on Thursday for the 1982 mob-related killing of a witness who was about to testify against Boston mob members, court officials said. Former FBI agent John Connolly ""crossed over to the dark side,"" a judge said. Disgraced ex-FBI agent John Connolly Jr. ""crossed over to the dark side,"" said Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Stanford Blake. The sentence will run consecutively to a 10-year racketeering sentence. Connolly, 68, was convicted in November of second-degree murder in the death of businessman John Callahan, an executive with World Jai-Alai. Callahan's bullet-riddled body was found in the trunk of a Cadillac parked at Miami International Airport. Connolly's fall from celebrated mob-buster to paid gangland flunky captivated a South Florida courtroom for weeks. In testimony at his sentencing hearing last month, he denied having any role in Callahan's death. ""It's heartbreaking to hear what happened to your father and to your husband,"" he told members of Callahan's family. ""My heart is broken when I hear what you say."" He explained, in the face of vigorous cross-examination, that rubbing elbows with killers and gangsters and winning their confidence was part of his job. His attorney argued that Connolly did what the FBI wanted him to do, and now was being held responsible. Connolly did not testify at his trial. Prosecutors had asked that Connolly be given a life sentence, saying the 30-year minimum was not enough because Connolly abused his badge. In a Boston Globe interview published last month, however, Connolly vigorously denied being a corrupt agent. ""I did not commit these crimes I was charged with,"" Connolly told the newspaper. ""I never sold my badge. I never took anybody's money. I never caused anybody to be hurt, at least not knowingly, and I never would."" During his two-month trial, jurors heard that Connolly told his mob connections that Callahan, 45, was a potential witness against them, setting him up for the gangland-style slaying. According to testimony, Connolly was absorbed by the very gangsters he was supposed to be targeting -- members of South Boston's notorious Winter Hill gang. His story was said to be the inspiration for the character played by Matt Damon in the 2006 Martin Scorsese movie, ""The Departed."" Connolly's tale was closely followed in New England, where he grew up in Boston's ""Southie"" neighborhood, the same area long dominated by the Winter Hill gang and its notorious leader, James ""Whitey"" Bulger. Sought in 19 slayings, Bulger is the FBI's second most-wanted fugitive. During the first two decades of his FBI career, Connolly won kudos in the bureau's Boston office, cultivating informants against New England mobsters. Prosecutors said Connolly was corrupted by his two highest-ranking snitches: Bulger and Stephen ""The Rifleman"" Flemmi. Connolly retired from the FBI in 1990 and later was indicted on federal racketeering and other charges stemming from his long relationship with Bulger and Flemmi. He was convicted of racketeering in 2002 and was serving a 10-year federal prison sentence when he was indicted in 2005 in the Callahan slaying. During testimony, jurors heard that Connolly was on the mob payroll, collecting $235,000 from Bulger and Flemmi while shielding his mob pals from prosecution and leaking the identities of informants. The prosecution's star witnesses at the Miami trial were Flemmi, who is now in prison, and mob hit man John Martorano, who has admitted to 20 murders, served 12 years in prison and is now free. Callahan, who often socialized with gangsters, had asked the gang to execute Oklahoma businessman Roger Wheeler over a business dispute, according to testimony. Martorano killed Wheeler in 1981 on a golf course, shooting him once between the eyes, prosecutors said. After Connolly told Bulger and Flemmi that Callahan was going to implicate them in the slaying, Martorano was sent to do away with Callahan, prosecutors said. But one star witness did not testify -- the former FBI agent who inspired the 1997 film ""Donnie Brasco."" He refused to take the stand after the judge denied his request to testify anonymously.","NEW: Ex-FBI agent ""crossed over to the dark side,"" judge says .

"(CNN) -- A federal judge ordered the Obama administration Friday to stop temporarily the forced feeding of a detainee at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and provide videotapes of past such feedings. U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler ordered the administration to preserve and turn over the videotapes of the forced feeding of detainee Mohammed Abu Wa'el Dhiab between April 9, 2013, and February 19, 2014, according to court documents. The judge also ordered the federal government to preserve all videotapes of forcible cell extractions of Dhiab. Dhiab, 42, a Syrian, was arrested in Pakistan in 2002 and has been detained in Guantanamo for more than 10 years, according to the London-based human rights group Reprieve. The group says it has been acting on behalf of Dhiab and his effort to secure 140 to 150 videos. Reprieve describes a forcible cell extraction as the Guantanamo base's process in which detainees who do not wish to be force-fed are restrained, sometimes ""violently,"" and taken to a force-feeding chair. The forced feedings are the U.S. government's response to hunger strikes by detainees. Dhiab, in court filings,seeks an injunction against ""abusive"" and painful force-feedings. U.S. Justice Department attorneys argued in court papers that although Dhiab was subject to forced feedings between March 2013 and February 2014, ""the medical records during that time period are not material to his current motion for preliminary injunction, which seeks prospective injunctive relief to stop (forced) feeding going forward."" Dhiab also hasn't shown which forcible cell extractions were ""unlawful,"" the government's attorneys said in court papers filed Thursday. ""His motion is completely devoid of any details regarding specific instances of mistreatment. Rather, he has only raised vague and speculative allegations of FCE abuse based almost entirely on statements of other detainees that provide no information about (Dhiab) whatsoever,"" the Justice Department attorneys said. Guantanamo, in southeastern Cuba, has been used by U.S. government for detainees suspected of terrorism since the 9/11 attacks in 2001. Dhiab was cleared for release by the Obama administration in 2009 and has never been charged, Reprieve's website said. Dhiab is in poor health with depression and uses a wheelchair, the rights group said. His return to Syria is now ""impossible"" because of that country's ongoing civil war, the group said. ""He urgently needs a country to step forward and offer him resettlement so that he can begin his life with his family again, in safety and in peace,"" Reprieve said. The judge scheduled a May 21 status conference on the videotapes and forced feedings.","Judge orders Obama administration to stop temporarily a detainee's forced feeding .

"(CNN) -- Life is never dull at Neuchatel Xamax, at least not since Bulat Chagaev took over the reins of the Swiss football club in May. In just seven months since the Chechen businessman bought previous owner Sylvio Bernasconi's majority stake, sacking has followed sacking, rumors have run rife, and controversy has never been far around the corner as a series of bizarre incidents has moved the team off the back pages and into the forefront of Swiss newspapers. Chagaev has, remarkably, fired four coaches, removed every local sponsor involved with the club from the previous season and dismissed his entire administrative staff, resulting in Xamax being unable to print any tickets for the opening match of the 2011-12 Swiss Super League campaign. He also sacked the entire coaching team following the 2-0 defeat to Basel in July, before a widely-reported incident in August when he burst into the dressing room with his bodyguards to berate the players following their performance in the 2-2 home draw with bottom club Lausanne-Sport. But Chagaev had not finished with his revolution, and in September he declared that the club would cut all ties with two of its biggest supporters' groups, who provided much-needed income for the club, thus alienating the hardcore fans he is trying to get on his side. Off the pitch, Chagaev is also battling various authorities on a number of fronts, with a raft of questions regarding the club's finances still remaining unanswered. Already fined $22,000 this season for flouting licensing rules after failing to respond to budget queries, the latest dramatic twist in the club's fortunes occurred in October when a court ruled against a player agent who tried to force Xamax into bankruptcy over a debt of 400,000 Swiss Francs ($444,000). But, in another twist, the public prosecutor of Neuchatel canton subsequently charged Chagaev with forgery, for allegedly falsifying a Bank of America document which was used as part of the evidence to prove his solvency in that trial. ""The Bank of America does not recognize the document as one of its own and contests that it has been produced by someone authorized to sign it in its name,"" the prosecutor said in a statement. Chagaev has subsequently accepted the documentation was false, but insists he had no idea how it came into the court's possession and that he was unaware of its existence -- and it will now be up to the courts to decide what part he played in its creation. However, the drama does not end there. A respected Swiss newspaper reported that Chagaev is illegally living in the country, because he does not have a valid residence permit. According to Le Matin, Chagaev has only a basic visa that must be renewed every six months, and only after leaving the country, and he was unable to produce a valid document when police visited him at his office in Geneva. ""He is an illegal immigrant that could be thrown out of the country at any time, just like any other foreigner who is on Swiss soil illegally,"" claimed the paper. Despite all this scrutiny into his affairs, very little is actually known about the reclusive Chagaev, who admits to having close ties with Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov. He rose to prominence in the 1990s as a member of the regional government of Chechnya and owned a successful export company. In Switzerland, Chagaev owns two Geneva-based firms, which reportedly oversee his oil and gas trading, real estate and construction empire, but it is his activities with Xamax which are causing greater concern, with some figures now fearing for the very existence of the club. Emmanuel Saraceno, sports editor of the French-speaking magazine L'Express, told CNN he believes Chagaev will eventually bankrupt Neuchatel. ""The whole club is in a real mess. Salaries are always paid late and November's wages have still not been paid, meaning players are going into the holidays without their wages,"" Saraceno said. ""It is hard to see a way out for the club at the moment. Chagaev says he has money, but cannot transfer it in Switzerland, which might be true, but there are so many things we don't know about him -- for example his relationship with the Chechen hierarchy. ""It is all a bit of a mystery because Chagaev does not speak French or German and access to him is very difficult."" Saraceno said the club faced a strike by players unhappy about their lack of payment. ""Some players are trying to leave because they haven't been paid for six weeks, although they need three months without pay to legally free themselves from their contracts. Either way, I have been told the players could strike before they are due to return on January 5,"" he said. ""I give the club only a 30% chance of surviving bankruptcy and Chagaev will go down with the club. For him it is all about pride and showing that he can succeed, because he is being criticized from all angles."" Florian Raz, sports editor for the Basel-based Tages Woche website, believes the Swiss authorities might decide to throw Xamax out of the Super League before the fixtures resume at the beginning of February. ""There are only 10 teams in the top division and they play each other home and away twice. Half those fixtures have already been played and if the league found financial irregularities with Xamax, they could throw them out without it disrupting the schedule,"" Raz told CNN. ""In Switzerland, you need to provide correct financial documentation to play in the Super League -- and this mess has happened because previous owner Bernasconi had the right documents, which then became Chagaev's when he bought the club. ""A club has never been sold after documents have been accepted -- and the league have now changed the rules to ensure each individual owner has to provide financial evidence. ""In March, the league will decide for next season, and it seems impossible that Xamax will be accepted under the current conditions."" With all this disarray in the boardroom, it is worth nothing that -- on the pitch at least -- current coach Victor Munoz is doing a decent job with the team. Xamax lie fifth in the table, just five points off second place, after a run of five wins and two draw in nine matches. But, with the festive period upon us, and wages still not being paid, it remains to be seen whether those players, or even the club, will still be around when the Swiss Super League finally returns to action.","Chechen-born Bulat Chagaev is the controversial owner of Neuchatel Xamax .

"(CNN) -- I never had the chance to meet Maya Angelou. But she has been in my life all along. In some of my darkest moments, her prose was a lit candle. When I felt alone, her words were my company. The times when I saw the glass ceiling hovering over my career, suffocating my joy, turning my hard-fought acceptance of my truth into a self-loathing cage from which I saw no escape, Maya Angelou came to me and said she knew why I sing. As much as she is known as a great defender of women's rights and lyrical curator of the black experience, I found so many of her words transcended the plight of any one particular group. She was so adept at linking us all through the human condition. I know I'll never be as good a writer as she was. But it's because of the effect her gift continues to have on me that I continue to try. I never had the chance to meet Maya Angelou. But her poem ""Phenomenal Woman"" found me. Hiding. Scared. Frozen in my seat decades ago when a well-meaning English teacher asked me to read a few stanzas out loud. A teenage boy is not supposed to say such things. A closeted teenage boy may be found out. Filled with anxiety, I abruptly refused and after a look, the teacher moved on, picking another student. Food, friends and freedom: Nikki Giovanni remembers Maya Angelou . But Maya Angelou stayed right there with me. ""Phenomenal Woman"" stayed right there with me. The images of the words resting in the recesses of my mind, until saying ""I'm a woman / Phenomenally. / Phenomenal woman, / That's me"" no longer threatened to define or paralyze me. Instead, when I finally had the courage, I found her words liberated me from the arbitrary rules of gender normality and my own internalized homophobia. I don't think I've ever shared that story with anyone before. Even as I was writing that passage, I was acutely aware that some readers will mock me for this disclosure. And it's because of Dr. Angelou that I smile at this prospect. ""You have no idea who you will inform because all of us are caged birds, have been and will be again,"" she said in 1998 at a fundraiser for the Human Rights Campaign. ""Caged by somebody else's ignorance. Caged because of someone else's small-mindedness. Caged because of someone else's fear, hate and sometimes, caged by our own lack of courage."" Maya Angelou remembered by those she inspired . An article in USA Today, written about her 80th birthday, touched on her rape at 7 by her mother's boyfriend. He was later murdered by her uncles. She stopped talking to anyone but her brothers for five years because she felt responsible for his death. She told the newspaper what her grandmother said about her silence: ""'Sister' -- she called me sister -- 'Momma don't care what other people say about you. Momma knows when you and the Lord are ready, you goin' to be a teacher.'"" The financial despair of newspapers, the decline of the neighborhood bookstore, the drop in book sales all suggest that the written word has lost its value. While it is true that electronic media have changed the vessel, that should never be mistaken for a decline in the value of the cargo it carries. Whether it be on a page of a magazine, a handwritten note or an e-mail, the power of the written word is still an inescapable force that can wound or heal. Deceive or reveal. Disregard or save. Maya Angelou: Some of her most powerful speeches . Consider the last thing Maya Angelou wrote: ""Listen to yourself and in that quietude you might hear the voice of God"" -- a tweet that is every bit as clear as any line found from her 1971 collection, ""Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Die."" I never had the chance to meet Maya Angelou. But when I needed encouragement, she came to me. In poems and in the songs of her album ""Miss Calypso."" She came to me through the familiar smell of aged paper that erupts from a book that hasn't been opened in quite a long time. She came to me when I met a subtle, homophobic slight at the office with a smile and knowing look that said, ""You may write me down in history / With your bitter, twisted lies, / You may trod me in the very dirt / But still, like dust, I'll rise."" I never had the chance to meet Maya Angelou. Not in this life anyway. But her words have always been a constant companion to me and I pray they will remain so until the day our two souls meet. And on that day I will say to her with tears in my eyes, ""Hello, dear friend.""

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- Japan's prime minister is in a world of political hurt right now. The latest poll numbers by the country's largest daily newspaper, The Yomiuri Shimbun, showed 24 percent of those polled approve of Yukio Hatoyama's performance, a nine-point drop from a month earlier, while 67 percent disapprove of him. So when Hatoyama recently opened the doors of his official residence to serve Japanese barbeque to ordinary voters for an event called the ""Real Hato Café,"" his earnest effort to talk to ordinary citizens didn't grab the attention of critic Don Konishi -- but his choice of clothing did. A multi-colored, throwback to the 1980s fashion disaster, Konishi explained, as he noted the prime minister's red, yellow, green, purple and blue-checked plaid shirt. The critic wrote a public condemnation about the shirt in a national magazine and warned the country that the multi-colored get-up represented what the poll numbers already show: Hatoyama is out of touch. ""This shirt comes from the '80s or '90s. His ideas and philosophy are old. Japan is facing a crisis and we can't overcome it with a prime minister like this."" It's the latest crime in a long fashion rap sheet, said Konishi, as he highlighted other multi-colored shirts, mauve coats, and what Konishi calls the biggest faux pas -- the hearts and pink blazer outfit. On the day Konishi spoke with CNN, he wore white-rimmed glasses, silver shoes and a small brimmed hat. ""A fashion designer like me can wear this, but not the leader of Japan,"" he said. Konishi feels so strongly about Hatoyama because the country felt passionately about the prime minister, who stormed into power last August in a historic wave of voter discontent. The Democratic Party of Japan unseated the Liberal Democratic Party, a ruling party that held power in the country for nearly 50 continuous years. In office, the prime minister and his wife have been a fascinating new sort of first couple for Japan. Mrs. Hatoyama, a published author, had previously published a tale in which she wrote that she had lived a previous life and in it, met American actor Tom Cruise. In another public admonition, she told a talk show that she gets energy by ""eating the sun."" The prime minister, shortly after his election, became a radio sensation when an old song of his -- a lounge tune recorded decades ago called ""Take Heart"" -- hit the airwaves. In the early months, the country embraced the quirks of the Hatoyamas. But then frustrating stalemates began to crop up in his administration -- primarily, criticism over Hatoyama's handling of the move of a U.S. base on the island of Okinawa. Those polled in The Yomiuri Shimbun said he has been wishy-washy on finding a solution for the Okinawans. The criticism of the shirt may seem catty and unimportant, but it's a bad sign, said Keith Henry, a government affairs consultant at Asia Strategy. ""As a politician, you want to have the focus on policy and your agenda. I think the press and the Japanese people have lost patience with him; patience to the extent that they're no longer paying attention to his policy proposals because no one has faith in his ability to implement them."" ""The press and the media are starting to nitpick on, really, things that are irrelevant to the future of the Japanese people but I would expect that to continue. Whether he's not dressing properly, goes to the wrong restaurants, spends too much on dinner, what his wife is wearing. It goes from the politics of policy to the politics of personality. And that doesn't help Japan."" The poll numbers are not lost on the man who is the subject of the study. Hatoyama told reporters: ""I take it seriously that my approval ratings are down significantly. But I'm not going to quit.""","Newspaper poll: 67 percent disapprove of Japan's PM Hatoyama .

"(CNN) -- If Pharrell Williams lived by Coco Chanel's rule and removed one accessory before leaving for the Grammy Awards Sunday, we all would have been worse for the wear. The producer/singer/songwriter showed up in a hat that became the conversation piece on a night when the conversation should have been about the music. Somehow, Pharrell's hat out-performed Taylor Swift, Willie Nelson, Imagine Dragons and Kendrick Lamar combined. When the artist first arrived on the red carpet, we couldn't wrap our minds -- nay, our eyes -- around what we were seeing. The headgear seemed to be as tall as it was wide, and we couldn't tell if Pharrell was channeling Smokey the Bear: . Curious George's hat-loving companion: . Or was just a devoted fan of Arby's. Of course it didn't take long until Pharrell's Hat got its own Twitter account. In the end, what appeared to be a fashion faux pas turned into a style win by the end of the night. Beyoncé's hair during her opening performance of ""Drunk In Love""? That's another story. The superstar took the stage with a short hairstyle of wet waves -- an obvious reference to the hair she wears in the music video for the song. But Twitter took one look at the water-logged locks and went wild: . We don't think Queen Bey suffered as much criticism as Madonna did, though. While the 55-year-old mom explained that her black suit, hat and cane were chosen by her son, David (who wore a matching outfit), that didn't make the armchair fashionistas any kinder. But, for all the talk about their outfits, all three artists walked away with bigger accomplishments last night. Beyoncé stunned on the red carpet and off it with her performance, Pharrell walked away with the producer of the year (non-classical) Grammy award, and Madge helped marry off 33 couples -- yes, 33! -- during a performance of Macklemore & Ryan Lewis' ""Same Love.""

"(CNN) -- Throughout history they've been humankind's most convenient, unwitting and trustworthy scapegoats for missing homework assignments and olfactory mishaps.

When Canton police responded to a 911 call Sunday for a vehicle that had gone into a local pond, the car's owner -- who police aren't naming -- said it was the doing of Rosie, his 5-month-old German Shepherd puppy.

"(CNN) -- Desperate times call for desperate measures. After a humbling League Cup defeat at the hands of lowly Sunderland, and with the reigning English champions a distant seventh in the Premier League table, Manchester United have broken the bank to bring in Juan Mata from Chelsea. A club record fee of £37.1 million ($61 million) was confirmed by the club late Saturday after the Spaniard passed a medical and agreed personal terms. The fee trumps £30.75 million ($51 million) that United paid Tottenham Hotspur for Dimitar Berbatov in 2008. WorldSportBlog: How not to appoint a football manager . In a statement released on Manchester United's official website Mata said: ""I am thrilled to be joining United. I have enjoyed some very happy years at Chelsea but the time has come for a new challenge. ""United is the perfect place for me and I am excited at the chance I have to be part of the next phase in the club's history. ""Chelsea is a top club and I have many friends there but you cannot turn down the chance to join Manchester United. I look forward to helping the manager and the team be successful in the coming years."" Manager David Moyes praised the 25-year-old describing him as ""one of the finest playmakers in the game today"" while drawing attention to his impressive haul of 32 goals and 28 assists during his previous two seasons at Stamford Bridge. ""I have been impressed with the excitement he has shown to be part of the new Manchester United. I know our fans have admired Juan for some time now -- he has always played well against us -- and I know they will be delighted to see him in the red of United, starting on Tuesday."" Mata's signing provides a much-needed fillip for a beleaguered Moyes who is enduring a nightmare start to his Old Trafford tenure. Moyes, 50, was the man chosen by the United hierarchy to replace Alex Ferguson, the legendary Scottish manager who retired in May after 26 years trophy-laden years at the helm having ensconced the club firmly at the pinnacle of domestic and European football. But elimination from both domestic cup competitions and a disastrous defence of the club's league title -- United sits 14 points behind leaders Arsenal -- have exposed the weaknesses in United's squad and led to suggestions former Everton manager Moyes can't cut it at football's top table. Moyes will be relieved to have finally secured the signature of a high-profile transfer target, following failed pursuits of star names such as Cesc Fabregas and a reported bid for Gareth Bale during the summer window. United's challenge has not been helped by injuries to key attackers Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney, with the latter casting a shadow over the early days of Moyes' by allegedly agitating for a move away from the club. The signing of Mata will bolster United's attack and the Spanish playmaker will be hoping he can propel his new team into the latter stages of the European Champions League and, in the process, secure his place in Spain's squad for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. United's participation in next season's Champions League is in doubt, with the team six points off fourth place and the final qualification spot for Europe's elite competition. Moyes' decision to plunge into the January market is at odds with the philosophy of his illustrious predecessor. ""Buying in January has seldom been a route we have taken,"" Ferguson said in December 2011. ""Unless a player we have always been interested in comes along ... it is not suitable for us."" Chelsea's decision to sell Mata has also been questioned. Mata has been voted Chelsea's Player of the Year in each of the past two seasons, but he has found himself an increasingly peripheral figure since Mourinho's second spell as manager of the Stamford Bridge club began in June. The former Valencia player has started just 11 of Chelsea's 22 league matches, with Mourinho deeming Mata surplus to requirements in his bid to win a third Premier League title with the London club.

"Khartoum, Sudan (CNN) -- The husband of a Sudanese woman sentenced to death for refusing to renounce her Christian faith fears for the lives of his family. Daniel Wani is asking U.S. officials to expedite the asylum process in the case of his wife, Mariam Yehya Ibrahim. Wani says if Ibrahim is released early, her life and the lives of his two children could be in grave danger if she has to remain in Sudan. Sudan's foreign ministry denied published reports Saturday that officials were preparing to release Ibrahim at any moment. Foreign ministry spokesman Abubakar Al-Sidiq said he was not aware of any plans to release Ibrahim before a ruling from an appeals court. ""My fear is ... if she is released and asylum has not been granted,"" Wani said Sunday. ""I am scared for all our lives -- me, my wife and my children -- if we have to remain inside Sudan, even a day after her release."" Wani is appealing to New Hamphire's U.S. Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Kelly Ayotte. ""They are working to grant Ibrahim asylum in the United States."" He said he's hopeful the asylum request can be fast-tracked. ""I appreciate all their efforts but I want to stress this needs to happen as soon as possible."" Ibrahim is committed to her religion . Wani is a U.S. citizen and a Christian. His wife was condemned to die by hanging after she declined to profess she is a Muslim, the religion of her father. Sharia law considers her a Muslim and does not recognize her marriage to a Christian. She is unlikely to change her mind despite giving birth in prison, Wani said. Technically, the president of Sudan cannot pardon her, so the judiciary might be the only way out for the government, which is coming under increased international pressure to release Ibrahim. The court convicted her of apostasy and adultery two weeks ago. At the time, she was eight months pregnant. She gave birth to a baby girl last week at a Khartoum prison, where she's detained with Martin, her 20-month-old son. Despite languishing in prison with two infants, she's holding firm to her beliefs, according to her husband. ""There is pressure on her from Muslim religious leaders that she should return to the faith,"" Wani told CNN in a TV exclusive. ""She said, 'How can I return when I never was a Muslim? Yes, my father was a Muslim, but I was brought up by my mother.' "" Wani said his wife is a practicing Christian, more so than him, and even had their son baptized. ""I know my wife. She's committed,"" he said. ""Even last week, they brought in sheikhs and she told them, 'I'm pretty sure I'm not going to change my mind.' "" Wani said he is thrilled about his new daughter but hopes her birth doesn't hasten his wife's death sentence. In past cases involving pregnant or nursing women, Sudan waited until the mother had weaned her child before executing any sentence. Sharia law as practiced in Sudan prohibits carrying out the death sentence on an pregnant woman until two years after she gives birth. CNN sought comment from the Sudanese government and was directed to the justice ministry. A CNN request for an interview was denied, and the justice minister said they don't comment on such matters because a final judgment has not yet been issued. An attempt to contact Sudan's foreign affairs minister for comment was unsuccessful. Woman raised as Christian, husband says . Ibrahim, 27, was arrested after Muslim relatives accused her of renouncing her religion. Their complaint alleged that she went missing for years, and her family was shocked to find out she married a Christian, according to her attorney, Mohamed Jar Elnabi. Wani said he'd never met the relatives who made the accusations. His wife, he said, was raised a Christian by her mother, an Ethiopian Orthodox, after her Muslim father deserted the family when Ibrahim was 6. ""These people filed charges claiming that she was their sister and filed a police report saying that she had disappeared,"" he said. At first, Ibrahim was charged with adultery for marrying a Christian. The apostasy accusation was added after she maintained she was a Christian, according to her husband. ""The police originally called for the case to be dismissed, but these people went back and added another charge ... which is adultery, by saying she was their sister and a Muslim. It is illegal for a Muslim woman to marry a Christian man, therefore we were brought before the court."" She's been detained since January 17, he said. In addition to the emotional turmoil resulting from the conviction, the couple also have to worry about their children, Wani said. ""An illegitimate marriage does not result in legally recognized offspring, which means that my son and the new baby are no longer mine,"" he said. Wani's physical condition makes the ordeal even harder. He uses a wheelchair and ""totally depends"" on Ibrahim, according to her lawyer. ""He cannot live without her,"" he said. Wani said he's not been allowed to visit his detained family as much since the apostasy charge was added. ""She's in a bad mood,"" he said of his wife. ""She's frustrated."" More punishment . In addition to the death sentence, the court sentenced Ibrahim to 100 lashes for the adultery conviction. The court had warned her to renounce her Christianity by May 15, but she has steadfastly maintained she is a Christian and will remain so. Sudanese Parliament speaker Fatih Izz Al-Deen said claims that she was raised as a non-Muslim were untrue. She was raised in an Islamic environment, and her brother, a Muslim, filed the complaint against her, according to Al-Deen. 'I'll stand by her' Wani said he was optimistic the appeal their lawyers have filed would lead to the court's ruling being overturned. ""I'm hoping that, given the way people have come together around the world -- which I want to thank them for,"" he said. ""All the rights groups, all the broadcasters ... It's looking like it had an effect. Perhaps it will result in the judgment being overturned."" But until it's done, the mother of his children has his support. ""I'm standing by her to end. Whatever she wants, I'll stand by her,"" he said. Worldwide condemnation . Rights groups and foreign embassies worldwide have condemned the verdict. The ruling also created shock waves in Sudan, where activists are defying the government and criticizing what they consider an overly harsh implementation and interpretation of Islam . ""The fact that a woman could be sentenced to death for her religious choice, and to flogging for being married to a man of an allegedly different religion, is abhorrent and should never be even considered,"" said Manar Idriss, Amnesty International's Sudan researcher. Foreign embassies in Khartoum, including those of the United States, United Kingdom and Canada, urged the Sudanese government to reverse course. There's no timetable on when the judicial process will be over, but the couple isn't giving up. The appeals court's ruling could come within the next week, their attorney says. Until then, they're grasping at small signs of hope. The last time Sudan executed someone for apostasy was in 1985 when a man criticized Sharia law. CNN's Nima Elbagir reported from Khartoum, and Faith Karimi reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","NEW: Daniel Wani fears for his family's lives .

"(CNN) -- For three weeks, Dr. William Petit went to a courtroom and re-lived the day he was attacked and his wife and daughters were killed in their Connecticut home. He calmly testified about being beaten awake from a nap and being taken to his basement tied up, not knowing what was happening to his family upstairs. He rarely left the New Haven courtroom, once excusing himself when a medical examiner testified. He listened stoically Tuesday after one of the accused was found guilty of capital murder. Now Petit will go through it in court all over again. Steven Hayes' penalty phase is ahead, and a second defendant will face trial afterward. ""People keep asking that question, why do you do it or how do you do it,"" Petit said after Hayes' verdicts were read Tuesday. ""... I think that you probably would all do the same thing for your families if your family was destroyed by evil."" Hayes, 47, was convicted on 16 of the 17 charges against him in connection with the deaths of Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her two daughters, including nine counts of murder and capital murder and four counts of kidnapping. The jurors acquitted him of an arson charge in the burning of the family's home. The killings of Hawke-Petit, 17-year-old Hayley Petit and 11-year-old Michaela Petit happened in the New Haven suburb of Cheshire on the morning of July 23, 2007. Prosecutors said Hayes and co-defendant Joshua Komisarjevsky entered the home the previous night, beat and bound Petit and attacked his wife and daughters before setting their home on fire. Komisarjevsky, 30, will be tried separately, and prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Hayes. Petit and other family members -- including Hawke-Petit's parents, who'd come up from Florida -- attended every session of Hayes' trial, which began September 13. Petit indicated he would attend Hayes' penalty phase, which begins October 18, and Komisarjevsky's trial. Being in the courtroom every day with the rest of his family was the one thing Petit felt he could do about that day in 2007, he told reporters Tuesday. ""Do I look forward to the ride every day? No,"" he said. ""I have a little nausea every time I get off the exit ramp, [and] a little nausea every time I get out of the car and walk across the street. I think I do it for my family, but I think all of you ... would do the same thing for your families."" Petit, an endocrinologist, testified on September 14 that he had fallen asleep in his home's sunroom as his wife and daughters were watching television July 22, 2007. He awoke as blood ran from a gash on his head, he said. ""I sort of awoke in a daze. ... The next thing I knew I was seated on the middle of the sofa, with my head down [and] there was something warm running down the side of my face,"" he testified. Petit testified that the attackers told him to lie down on the couch ""and tied my hands at the wrists and my feet at the ankles"" and covered his head with a piece of fabric. He was told he'd be shot if he moved, and eventually he was led to the basement, where he was tied to a pole by a rope around his chest and waist, his hands still bound with plastic zip ties, he testified. Prosecutors said Hayes took Hawke-Petit to a bank, where she withdrew $15,000. She was eventually found inside the home raped and strangled, authorities said. The attackers tied the girls to their beds and put a pillowcase over their heads, prosecutors said. After getting the money from the bank, the attackers set the home on fire and fled, prosecutors said. Inside the home, the two daughters, one of whom had been sexually assaulted, died of smoke inhalation, authorities said. Before the fire, Petit was able to untie the rope on his hands and break the plastic ties, but couldn't undo his feet. He said he heard ""three loud noises, like someone was throwing 20- or 30-pound sacks on the living room floor."" Petit testified he heard a ""whoosh"" sound shortly afterward. Fearing for his family's safety, Petit, still bound by his feet, hopped up his basement steps, left the home and headed for a nearby house, where he alerted a neighbor and asked him to call 911. Prosecutors say the attackers put gasoline in several plastic gallon-size jugs found at the house to start the fire in the home. During Hayes' trial, jurors were visibly stunned when they were shown pictures of the victims' burned remains, and at least one wept. Helen Ubiñas, a Hartford Courant columnist who covered the trial, told CNN that the testimony and evidence made the trial ""an incredibly grueling ordeal for the family and for the jury."" CNN asked Ubiñas if she was surprised by Petit's stoicism in court. ""I think that's the one thing that many of us have been asking. We've been in awe of not just Dr. Petit, who of course has shown tremendous strength and grace through all this, but the whole Hawke and Petit families, I think, have shown the strength that many of us just wonder [if] we would have if we were put in that same situation."" Petit, asked after Tuesday's verdicts whether what happens to Hayes now matters to him, said that ""what matters to me most is my family and my memories of my family."" ""Over the last couple of weeks, I just kept trying to tell myself that good will overcome evil, and we'll keep trying to do good things and [I'll] try to refocus myself on the positive and stay away from the negative,"" he said. In Session's Michael Christian and Swetha Iyengar and CNN's Brooke Baldwin and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","Dr. William Petit addresses difficulty of attending trial of man convicted of killing Petit's family .

"(CNN) -- A troubled youth who reported inappropriate sexual conduct by a counselor at The Citadel's now-defunct summer camp told a school lawyer that several other campers had similar encounters, documents released by the military college show. ""It only happened to me one time. I know there are about five other kids that experienced it a few times,"" the former camper, whose name is redacted in the documents, told The Citadel's general counsel Mark Brandenburg in a 2007 interview. In that interview, the then-19-year old described how counselor Louis Neal ""Skip"" ReVille had shown boys pornography, masturbated in front of them and pressured them to join him during a summer five years before. The former camper said he gave in to the pressure, only to feel ""completely violated"" immediately afterward. ""After that incident, I kind of crossed over to the dark side,"" he said, according to a transcript released by The Citadel this week. ""I started doing horribly in school. It led to drug use and you know -- cigarettes, alcohol ... and for the longest time, you know, I just thought it was my fault."" ReVille was arrested in October on charges of molesting at least five children in alleged incidents in the Charleston area, unrelated to The Citadel accusations. According to court documents, he has admitted guilt in at least three cases involving incidents between November 2010 and October 2011. ReVille's attorney, Craig Jones Jr., has said his client is sorry for what he did, according to CNN affiliate WCBD. ""Hopefully the way he's cooperated, that's one way he can hopefully show ... do what he can to help the victims to whatever extent he can,"" Jones said. ""There's no way that, obviously, he can repair the damage that's been done."" The Citadel is now facing questions about why it didn't bring the allegations against him to police at the time the former camper's family approached school officials with his story. ""I don't want him to do to another kid what he did to me,"" the camper told Brandenburg in 2007, according to the documents. The school's president, retired Air Force Lt. Gen. John Rosa, said Monday that the university is ""profoundly sorry"" for the way it handled the matter. ""When the family did not pursue the matter, we did not either. We should have,"" Rosa said. ""Regardless of whether the law said we were supposed to report or not, we should have reported this. We should have taken more action."" Ex-Citadel counselor long worked with kids . And in a written statement, Rosa said Brandenburg tried to contact other people the former camper identified, without success. ""After initial communications were not returned, it was understood they did not want to speak with us,"" Rosa said in a written statement. ""However, we should have more aggressively sought out individuals able to shed light on the incident."" Mullins McLeod, a lawyer for the boy's family, said the family had believed the school would report the allegation to police. ""The father looked up online and saw there was a requirement, he believed, that the institution report it to local local law enforcement,"" McLeod said. ""He's a Citadel alumnus, and he went straight to the president of the college."" The transcript was among hundreds of pages of documents released by The Citadel this week in response to a public-records request. The story has attracted national attention in the wake of the Penn State child sex abuse scandal, which led to the ouster of that university's president and legendary head football coach Joe Paterno. The Citadel has said a review of ReVille's records in 2007 revealed no other complaints, and his file included a clean background check. He was a highly respected cadet and denied the accusation, the college said. The former camper came forward a year after the 165-year-old military academy paid $3.8 million to settle a lawsuit involving another camp counselor. That counselor, Marine Capt. Michael Arpaio, later served 15 months in prison for sexual abuse. In the Arpaio case, The Citadel said it ""acted immediately to investigate the report"" and remove him. Rosa said Monday the school has hired a New York-based security consulting firm to review its handling of the ReVille case and recommend improvements. The former camper said his life had gone into a downward spiral after his encounter with ReVille -- but at the time of his interview, he had earned a high-school diploma, was working a steady job and was considering joining the military. ""I was put in a hole because of what happened. I've been trying really hard to get myself out of this hole,"" he said. According to documents released by The Citadel, when Brandenburg asked him whether he had reported the abuse to police, he replied, ""Well, I've talked to you."" Brandenburg told him, ""I'm not a law-enforcement official. I don't have a badge or anything like that. And my job is to look out after the day-to-day legal well-being, so to speak, of the school."" The Citadel approached ReVille with the allegation, and ReVille denied it, according to an August 2007 memo from Brandenburg. However, Brandenburg noted a previous counselor accused of sexual misconduct had denied allegations against him in an ""equally forceful"" manner, and that denial ""ultimately proved false."" The university sent letters to two former cadets who served as camp counselors the same year, but there was no indication in the records that they responded. The Citadel closed the file on the matter in November 2007, four months after the interview with the former camper. Rosa said the school has shared all information the school had with the Charleston police department, and asked anyone who had other information regarding ReVille to step forward.","NEW: ""I was put in a hole because of what happened,"" the former camper said .

"(CNN) -- This past week, like many Americans, I observed the media frenzy surrounding New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie as he deliberated over whether to opt in or out of the presidential race. As a researcher who studies weight discrimination, I anticipated some of the comments on Christie's body weight that inevitably emerged in the press. I was surprised, however, at just how much his body weight dominated coverage. Even among reputable news organizations and political pundits, few could resist mocking Christie's ""puffed up body,"" stereotyping him as undisciplined, or offering the unsolicited advice to ""eat a salad and take a walk."" Rather than his qualifications, reports often featured derogatory comments -- some veiled, many not -- fat jokes, weight-related puns and abundant stereotypes, providing a clear example of how socially acceptable weight bias and discrimination against obese persons have become in our society. How common is this? It may seem less significant compared with discrimination on the basis of gender or race, but it is rapidly increasing and no less important. Research shows that weight discrimination in the United States has increased by 66% over the past decade. It is now the third-most common type of discrimination reported by women, and the fourth most common among men. Recent estimates even show that weight discrimination is comparable to prevalence rates of racial discrimination. Weight discrimination is especially common in the jobs setting. Decades of research have shown that overweight and obese employees are much less likely to be hired than thinner employees (even with identical, or better qualifications), they receive lower wages, are less likely to be promoted and are more likely to be fired from their jobs, compared with thinner employees. Criticism of Christie's weight suggests this prejudice exists even if the job under consideration is at the highest levels of government -- and it isn't the first time. Surgeon General Dr. Regina Benjamin's excess weight was publicly censured and critiqued in the media discussion over her appointment, often eclipsing consideration of her impressive credentials, awards and accomplishments. But in this most current debate -- over the issue of Christie's weight -- much of the discussion stems from public misperceptions about body weight and physical appearance. Health (and health risk) comes in different sizes. Physical appearance alone is not sufficient to make determinations about health (or to infer anything about other characteristics, such as personal discipline, willpower or political influence, as some recent media reports otherwise suggest). We cannot make assumptions about Christie's health status, let alone the health status of other thinner political candidates. There are many overweight individuals who eat a balanced diet and exercise regularly; there are many thin individuals who smoke cigarettes, drink too much alcohol, eat poorly, have high blood pressure and are sedentary. Being thin is not an automatic indicator of health, and neither is being overweight. If Christie's health status is to be scrutinized, then the health status of his political peers should be scrutinized as well. To be clear: There is no reason to assume that a person can't be an effective political leader simply because of his or her body weight. Discounting an individual's credentials, training, abilities or accomplishments because of body weight is discriminatory. And it communicates an unfair, harmful message that a person's talents and contributions to society have lesser value if that person is obese. Given that two-thirds of Americans are overweight and obese, this is neither an accurate nor appropriate message. Unfortunately, for people who have been discriminated against because of their weight, little recourse exists. There are no federal laws to prohibit weight discrimination. Only one state -- Michigan -- has legislation making it unlawful to discriminate against obese persons. Some individuals have pursued cases of weight discrimination through the Americans with Disabilities Act, but few have succeeded. And yet the time may be nearing for more widespread legislation. In a recent study, my colleagues and I surveyed a national sample of 1,001 Americans about whether or not they would support legislation to prohibit weight discrimination. We found that many Americans are in favor of these laws, especially in the context of employment. Specifically, our study found that 81% of women and 65% of men expressed support for laws that would make it illegal for employers to discriminate against obese employees because of their weight. These findings suggest that more people are becoming aware of weight discrimination as a problem in the workplace, and are in favor of doing something about it. It's time to raise the bar (and the standards of journalistic reporting) for appropriate and respectful treatment of Americans who are obese. Because a person's body weight says nothing about his or her abilities, character or contributions to society. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rebecca Puhl.","Rebecca Puhl: Media fixated on Gov. Chris Christie's weight as he pondered presidential run .

"Albany, New York (CNN) -- The number of Americans living in states covered by same-sex marriage laws has more than doubled after New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a bill into law that gave gay and lesbian couples the right to marry. Cuomo signed the measure after it passed a Republican-controlled Senate on Friday night, raising questions as to whether the move reflects new momentum in the gay rights movement. Cuomo said the law will grant same-sex couples equal rights to marry ""as well as hundreds of rights, benefits and protections that are currently limited to married couples of the opposite sex."" A few of those are the right of inheritance, employer health benefits and a host of state tax benefits. That will not include Social Security benefits through a spouse, because that is a federal benefit. The controversial law passed by a narrow 33-to-29 vote -- a first for a GOP-led state Senate -- making New York the sixth state in the union to legalize same-sex marriage. But the decision also drew a sharp rebuke from opponents, who spent millions to try to defeat the measure. ""We worry that both marriage and the family will be undermined by this tragic presumption of government in passing this legislation that attempts to redefine these cornerstones of civilization,"" the state's Catholic bishops said in a joint statement released late Friday. It was signed by Archbishop Timothy M. Dolan and seven other bishops. Opponents of the marriage equality law have vowed to take political action against any Republican who voted for the bill. New York, which gave birth to the gay rights movement in the 1960s, will become the sixth state to allow same-sex marriages. Currently, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont and New Hampshire and the District of Columbia grant same-sex marriage licenses. New York state's population is 19,378,102, according to the 2010 U.S Census. The population of the other five states plus Washington equals 15,671,450: Massachusetts has 6,547,629 residents, . Connecticut has 3,574,097, Iowa has 3,007,856, New Hampshire has 1,316,470, Vermont has 625,741 and Washington has 599,657. The Senate vote came after days of delays that included last-minute negotiations, passing by a slim margin with the support of four Republicans. Cuomo credited four Republican senators who joined the majority of the state's Senate Democrats for the passage of the bill -- which is to take effect in 30 days -- saying they were ""people of courage."" ""I think it was politically more dangerous for a Republican,"" Cuomo told reporters late Friday. ""The conservative party was threatening them with consequences ... and they did it anyway."" A vote on the measure, which the Assembly passed June 15, had been stalled in the Senate. But it turned a corner late Friday, according to Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos, after lawmakers agreed on an amendment to protect religious groups from litigation that had been pushed by Republicans. The Assembly passed a new version of the bill that included the amendment about religious institutions. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who courted Republicans to approve the bill, called the vote a ""historic triumph for equality and freedom."" ""In recent weeks, I have had many conversations with our state senators. I emphasized that not only is marriage equality consistent with bedrock American principles, but it is also consistent with bedrock Republican Party principles of liberty and freedom -- and the Republicans who stood up today for those principles will long be remembered for their courage, foresight, and wisdom. In fact, 10 or 20 or 30 years from now, I believe they will look back at this vote as one of their finest, proudest moments,"" Bloomberg said in a statement released shortly after the vote. CNN's Mary Snow contributed to this report.","NEW: The number of people living in states covered by same-sex marriage doubles .

"(CNN) -- The list of Russians targeted by Western sanctions is expanding. The EU has added a further 12 names to its original 21-strong lists, while the U.S. focused its sanctions on some of the key people from President Vladimir Putin's inner circle. Here is a selection of some of the most interesting names from the lists: . Vladislav Surkov . Surkov is a close aide and adviser to Putin. He is often described as the ""Gray Cardinal"" of the Kremlin, one of the masterminds behind the current Russian political system. He served as the deputy chief of staff of Putin's presidential office and as Putin's deputy when Putin held the position of prime minister. Surkov resigned from that position last year. Valentina Matviyenko, Speaker of the Federation Council . Effectively number three on Russia's power list, and one of the highest-ranking women in Russian politics. Matviyenko is a firm supporter of Putin and rose to power as the governor of St. Petersburg, Putin's home town. She is credited with bringing major investors into St. Petersburg and transforming the city into an international hub. Several global companies, including General Motors and Nissan invested in the region while it was under her governorship. Arkady and Boris Rotenberg . The Rotenberg brothers have close links with Putin, having been his sparring partners in judo training for years. Boris is the president of Dynamo Moscow football club, while Arkady is an executive for Dynamo's ice-hockey club. The U.S. says the two received about $7 billion in contracts for the Sochi Olympic Games. ""They have made billions of dollars in contracts for Gazprom and the Sochi Winter Olympics awarded to them by Putin,"" the U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement announcing the sanctions. Gennady Timchenko, founder of energy trading company Gunvor . Magnate Gennady Timchenko's activities in the energy sector have been directly linked to Putin, according to the U.S. Treasury. Gunvor is responsible for much of Russia's oil export transactions. In a statement Thursday, Gunvor said Timchenko sold all his shares in the company on March 19. It added that Putin ""has not and never has had any ownership"" interest in Gunvor. The U.S. said Putin has investments in Gunvor, and may have access to Gunvor funds. Dmitry Kiselev, news anchor . One of the most influential pro-Kremlin journalists in Russia. Known for his highly controversial views. Advocating Russia's anti-gay laws in 2013, he said: ""I believe it is not enough to impose fines on gays for engaging in the propaganda of homosexuality among adolescents. We need to ban them from donating blood and sperm, and if they die in car accidents, we need to bury their hearts in the ground or burn them as they're unsuitable for the aiding of anyone's life."" Sergei Ivanov, Chief of staff of the presidential executive office . Ivanov has been Putin's colleague for decades, since their years of service in the Soviet KGB in St. Petersburg. They continued working together in the Federal Security Office in the 1990s and later in politics. Ivanov served as Putin's first deputy prime minister from 2001 to 2007 and was seen as one of Putin's potential successors in 2008. Vladimir Yakunin, Russian railway chairman . Yakunin is another St Petersburg figure. The Russian Railway chief was in charge of some of the biggest infrastructure projects of the Sochi Winter Olympics. Yakunin was also involved in a holiday housing community in the countryside outside St Petersburg. Set up in the 90s, media has speculated that Putin was also involved in the housing cooperative, together with Ivanov and Kovalchuk. Yuri Kovalchuk, Bank Rossiya's largest shareholder. The U.S. Treasury Department described Kovalchuk as ""the personal banker"" to Putin and other senior Russian officials. Bank Rossiya is Russia's 17th biggest bank, with $10 billion in assets, according to a senior U.S. administration official. It has substantial interests in oil and gas. Elena Mizulina (also known as Yelena Mizulina), a State Duma Deputy . Mizulina was one of the parliamentarians behind Russia's anti-gay legislation and was also a strong proponent of the anti-Magnitsky law, which banned adoptions of Russian orphans by American families.

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Iran said Wednesday it is investigating reports of violence at a Tehran University dormitory in the wake of rallies sparked by last week's disputed election. The aftermath of anti-riot police actions at Tehran University shows smashed computer terminals. Tehran University students told a CNN iReporter that government forces staged a massive crackdown early Monday at the university's dorm. Some students were detained in the raid. Students jumped out of windows to escape the Iranian police forces who threw tear gas and beat students, according to the iReporter, a former Tehran University student who now lives outside Iran. He did not want to be identified for security reasons. CNN has been unable to confirm the account because of restrictions on international media in Tehran. Parliament speaker Ali Larijani on Wednesday called for an ""unbiased report"" by the team of lawmakers appointed to look into the ""unfortunate incidents"" at the university dorm, according to Iran's government-funded Press TV. ""There has been news of unfortunate incidents taking place in parts of the city such as the Tehran University dormitory, and it appears that hidden hands are at work to feed foreign media outlets with propaganda,"" Larijani said. The investigating lawmakers have spoken to Tehran University students and other officials and are demanding the release of the detained students, Press TV reported. The lawmakers are also calling for the arrest and punishment of those who perpetrated the violence and for students to be compensated for their loss, according to Press TV. The CNN iReporter said one Tehran University student e-mailed him as the assault on the dormitory happened between 1 and 5 a.m. Monday. ""So around 4 a.m., he sends this very frightening e-mail. He says, 'Right now Ansaar [pro-government] forces are outside of buildings and threatening students to, 'Get out of the rooms like good boys.' Thank God the night is going to be over soon. Please pray for us!'"" the iReporter told CNN. A couple hours later, the student wrote, ""Some students jumped out of windows to save themselves and got injured, but the shameless forces even beat and arrested those too. ... Some of the arrested students are released after more beating and interrogation, others are missing."" The iReporter said he believes Iranian students have ""a very important role"" in Iranian politics, but noted that the current protests in Iran are more than just a student movement. ""At least the perspective that those forces have is that the students are at the leadership of this movement,"" he said. ""This might or might not be true especially right now because all the people are involved in this protest and it's not only students. They have a very important role here."" There have been reports of crackdowns on other Iranian universities. Amateur video posted on YouTube showed several injured people identified as Isfahan University students. Amnesty International said it appeared students were also targeted at Tabriz University in northwestern Iran when security forces entered dormitories there and detained 10 students. Amnesty also reported similar crackdowns on university students in the cities of Shiraz, Mashhad and Zahedan. The human rights agency called on Iranian authorities to ""end attacks on students.""

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Personal details and photographs of the incoming head of Britain's international spy agency have been posted on Facebook, British Foreign Secretary David Miliband acknowledged Sunday. The UK's Foreiogn Office says foreign service staff should exercise caution on social-networking Web sites. But he insisted that no compromising information had been revealed. ""You know he wears Speedo, swim, swimming, swimsuit... I mean what is that? I mean, that's not a state secret,"" Miliband said on a BBC Sunday morning talk show. The man in question, John Sawers, is currently the British ambassador to the United Nations. His wife posted details about their family, vacations and residence on the social-networking site, British media reported Sunday. Her Web site has since been taken down, reports said. Have you ever posted something you later regretted on a social-networking Web site? Sawers ""was appointed 10 days ago to be the head of MI6,"" said Miliband, using the common term for the Secret Intelligence Service. ""He is an outstanding professional who will do a really good job in an outstanding organization that does a huge amount for this country,"" Miliband added. ""The fact that there is a picture, the head of MI6 goes swimming. I mean, wow! That really is exciting. It is not a state secret."" But intelligence analyst Glenmore Trenear-Harvey said the leak was at least an embarrassment and possibly much worse. ""Have you ever seen the foreign secretary more embarrassed?"" he asked rhetorically. ""The Foreign Office should have made the announcement that no personal details should have been left on any computer or directory,"" Trenear-Harvey told CNN. The leak compromises Sawers' personal security, said Trenear-Harvey, the editor-in-chief of ""The World Intelligence Review."" ""You could have someone come online and insinuate themselves with Lady Sawers' daughter,"" who reportedly appeared on the Facebook Web site. If she shares a computer with her father at home, ""the house could pick up a virus, and once that happens we have access to the next chief of the Secret Intelligence Service,"" the analyst said. An additional reason for red faces is that Sawers will be in charge of a new British cybersecurity organization when he becomes head of MI6, Trenear-Harvey pointed out. The new organization, based at GCHQ, another British intelligence agency, will be ""charged with making sure that all the intelligence services are not vulnerable to hacking, identity theft, or phishing,"" Trenear-Harvey said. This is not the first time a top British intelligence official's personal details have been leaked. When Richard Dearlove became the head of MI6 in 1999, ""his address in Putney was announced,"" forcing the government to put Special Branch police officers there to protect him, Trenear-Harvey said. And when Stella Rimington became the first publicly named head of MI5, the domestic security agency, in 1991, her north London address was revealed. ""She and her daughter fled the house and were put into an MI5 safe house,"" Trenear-Harvey said. Foreign service officers ""are advised to exercise caution"" on social-networking Web sites, a Foreign Office representative said, declining to be named, in line with government policy. Sawers, 53, is a career foreign policy expert. He was a foreign policy adviser to Tony Blair when Blair was prime minister, then became ambassador to Egypt and briefly represented Britain in Iraq. He was political director at the Foreign Office for four years before going to the United Nations in 2007, according to his biography on the Web site of the British mission to the U.N. He is slated to replace John Scarlett in November as head of MI6. As chief of SIS, he reports to the foreign secretary, according to the SIS Web site. ""Known as the Chief of SIS or 'C' (after the first Chief, Mansfield Smith Cumming, who signed himself 'C'), the Chief is the only serving member of the Service who is officially named in public,"" according to the agency.

"(CNN) -- Timothy Bradley says he needs to beat Manny Pacquiao for a second time in Las Vegas on Saturday to move on from the controversial conclusion of their first fight two years ago. The WBO welterweight champion won a contentious points decision when the pair met in June 2012, inflicting a first defeat on Pacquiao in seven years. Boxing commentators roundly criticized the result while former heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis said the scoring showed that boxing had lost its integrity. Bradley claims he subsequently received death threats and that he was unfairly targeted by fans and the media alike for the decision of the ringside judges. ""It would mean the world to me to get this victory for me and my family because of everything we went through in the past,"" the 30-year old told CNN's Don Riddell. ""It was like I stole something from the world that night. All I did was do my job. People ridiculed me, demonized me."" Bradley insists these dark experiences made him stronger as a person and will act as the perfect motivation ahead of the MGM Grand rematch. He questioned Pacquiao's hunger at the pre-fight press conference Thursday, suggesting the legendary Filipino's best days are behind him. Pacquiao has won world titles at seven weight divisions in a career stretching 18 years but has lost two of his last three fights. ""What really motivates me for this fight is what my opponent said,"" Pacquiao countered in riposte to Bradley's claims. ""He said I don't have the killer instinct any more, I don't have the aggressiveness any more. This helps me, it helps a lot."" Although he recorded a comfortable victory over Brandon Rios last November, Pacquiao was knocked out for the first time since 1999 by Juan Manuel Marquez in his previous bout. At 35, it would be difficult for Pacquiao to resurrect his career at the very highest level if defeated by Bradley for a second time but he refuses to entertain this notion ahead of the contest. ""My mind is set in the winners side not on the losers side,"" he said. ""I always think positive and not negative."" ""This fight on Saturday will be to prove that my journey in boxing will continue and I'm excited for that.""","Timothy Bradley faces Manny Pacquiao for the WBO welterweight title in Las Vegas Saturday .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- While China has become the world's second largest economy, doing business in China is now perceived to be more corrupt, according to Transparency International.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- One day after President Obama ripped Wall Street executives for their ""shameful"" decision to hand out $18 billion in bonuses in 2008, Congress may finally have had enough. ""You can't use taxpayer money to pay out $18 billion in bonuses,"" an angry Sen. Claire McCaskill says. An angry U.S. senator introduced legislation Friday to cap compensation for employees of any company that accepts federal bailout money. Under the terms of a bill introduced by Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, no employee would be allowed to make more than the president of the United States. Obama's current annual salary is $400,000. ""We have a bunch of idiots on Wall Street that are kicking sand in the face of the American taxpayer,"" an enraged McCaskill said on the floor of the Senate. ""They don't get it. These people are idiots. You can't use taxpayer money to pay out $18 billion in bonuses.""  Watch McCaskill's heated words » . McCaskill's proposed compensation limit would cover salaries, bonuses and stock options. On Thursday, Obama said the prospect that some of the $700 billion Wall Street bailout could end up paying for bonuses to managers of struggling financial institutions was ""shameful."" The president said it was the ""height of irresponsibility"" for executives to pay bonuses when their companies were asking for help from Washington. ""The American people understand we've got a big hole that we've got to dig ourselves out of, but they don't like the idea that people are digging a bigger hole even as they're being asked to fill it up,"" Obama added. McCaskill's proposal comes three days after struggling banking giant Citigroup -- which has taken about $45 billion from the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program -- reversed plans to accept delivery of a $42 million corporate jet. The company changed its mind under Treasury Department prodding. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani defended corporate bonuses Friday, saying that cutting them also means slashing jobs in the Big Apple.

"(CNN) -- What role, if any, did legally purchased and consumed marijuana play in a husband's alleged murder of his wife this week in Denver? That's what police are investigating in the shooting death of Kristine Kirk, who called 911 Monday and, according to a police affidavit, said her husband, Richard Kirk, was hallucinating after he had ""taken some marijuana."" ""This is under investigation,"" Denver police spokeswoman Raquel Lopez said about the possibility of marijuana use. Kristine Kirk, 44, told a 911 operator that her husband also may have been on some prescription medication for back pain, according to a police affidavit. The affidavit, written by a police detective, recounts details of the 13-minute 911 call that ended with what the detective described as ""the sound of a gunshot."" According to the affidavit: . Kristine Kirk told the 911 operator that her husband was speaking ominously about ""the end of the world"" and said he wanted her to shoot him. She said she feared for herself and her three children, who were in the house. ""At one point during the call (she) sounds panicked and tells the 911 operator that Richard was taking the firearm out of the safe,"" the affidavit says. Seconds later the 911 operator heard screams and there was a gunshot sound. The call went silent. Police arrived at the home to find Kristine Kirk dead, a gunshot wound to her head. As an officer put Richard Kirk in the backseat of a patrol car, he admitted ""without questioning"" that he killed his wife, a police document says. On Friday, Denver District Attorney Mitch Morrissey charged Richard Kirk with first-degree murder in his wife's death. It could not be determined Friday whether Kirk had retained an attorney on his own. The Denver public defender's office didn't immediately return a call. Investigators took a blood sample to determine whether Kirk was under the influence of any substances at the time of the shooting. But even if those blood tests reveal traces of tetrahydrocannabinol -- or THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana -- some are saying it's unfair and irresponsible to blame the killing on his alleged use of marijuana. ""I think there are a lot of facts that we don't know about this story"" said Rachel K. Gillette, executive director of Colorado NORML -- the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. ""Bottom line: any drug, whether it's caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, cocaine, prescription drugs -- they all come with certain levels of health risks. That's one of the reasons we're right to be regulating (marijuana)"" During a search of the Kirk's home, police found a receipt in the basement for purchases made on the day of the killing at a marijuana dispensary called Nutritional Elements, according to a warrant. Kirk spent $32.70 on two items: Karma Kandy Orange Ginger -- a type of candy-form marijuana -- and Pre 98 Kush Pre-Roll -- a pre-rolled joint. Colorado became the first state in the nation to legalize the sale of recreational marijuana, allowing pot stores to open for business on January 1. A Nutritional Elements employee hung up immediately when a CNN reporter identified himself Friday. ""As tragic as this is"" said Gillette, ""we can't look at this one isolated incident and say that (legalizing marijuana) was the wrong path to go down. The best way to keep marijuana safe is for regulatory oversight and testing."" Richard Kirk is being held without bond in the Denver Detention Center.
