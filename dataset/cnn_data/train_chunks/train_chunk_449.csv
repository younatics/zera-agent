"Montreal (CNN)Canadian authorities are looking for at least four teenagers who may have flown to Turkey in a bid to join ISIS, a police source told CNN -- the latest in a string of such defections by Westerners lured to the Middle East fight for the Islamist group. Two of the four teenagers are women from Laval, Quebec, while at least one is a male from Montreal, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported. The teenagers reportedly flew from Montreal to Turkey in mid-January. Two days later, family members alerted the police. It's unclear where the teens are now. Three of them attended a Montreal community college that has now suspended its lease arrangement with an Islamic group after finding evidence of what administrators described as ""hate speech"" involving one of the group's leaders, according to a school official. One of the students took two class sessions offered by the organization, its representative, Adil Charkaoui, told reporters. He described the teenager as quiet and ""very shy."" ""We didn't evaluate him, so really we don't know about his level in religion and in Arabic,"" said Charkaoui, who denied any links to radical Islam. Canadian authorities say they are looking at the possibility that other youths may have followed a similar path, but they won't say how many. Friends of one of the teenagers identified her as 18-year-old Shayma Senouci, describing her as smart, kind and ""normal"" -- not one to talk religion. RCMP declined to comment when asked to confirm that Senouci is among those believed to be in the Middle East. What is ISIS' appeal for young people? The disappearances are the latest example of a troubling trend for Western authorities: a steady flow of young Muslims born or raised in the West, lured to Iraq and Syria by slick propaganda churned out by the Islamist group. Some 3,400 Westerners have gone to fight for ISIS, Nicholas Rasmussen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, said in recent U.S. congressional testimony. In the Canadian case, three of the four students attended Montreal CEGEP Collège de Maisonneuve, according to an official there. On Thursday, the school said it had decided to stop leasing classroom space to an Islamic organization that provided Arabic and Quran studies. The organization, École des Compagnons, was suspended because the college found evidence of ""hate speech and non-respect for our values"" involving one of the group's leaders, spokeswoman Brigitte Desjardins said. ""We are going to interrupt the contract we have with this organization until we have more information,"" she said. The agreement is less than a year old, Desjardins said. Charkaoui told reporters Friday that his organization isn't involved in radical Islam, and will sue if the college does not reverse course. ""We are teaching Arabic, (the) Quran and have given half-hour (lessons on) soccer and 20 minutes about religion,"" he said. Charkaoui describes himself on his Twitter account as ""Coordinator of the Collective Against Islamophobia Quebec, Professor, PhD student in Educational Sciences."" Some students at the school interviewed by the CBC were baffled by the news that some contemporaries might go fight for ISIS. ""It's shocking, I don't understand how this could happen,"" one student told the network. ""It just makes us think, what were they thinking?"" another student said. Paula Newton reported from Montreal and Kim Hutcherson wrote this report from Atlanta. CNN's Dominique Dodley contributed to this report.","Representative of Islamic group suspended by college denies any radical ties .

"(CNN)Desperately pursuing a nuclear deal with Iran, scrapping old positions and offering new concessions at a mind-boggling pace, the Obama administration has lost sight of what this regime represents and why the United States and its allies have focused on its nuclear program to begin with. For more than a decade, U.S. leaders vowed to prevent Iran from acquiring or developing the technology and know-how of nuclear weaponry for a simple reason: we did not want one of the world's most dangerous regimes to possess (and potentially use or distribute) the world's most dangerous weapons. That's why, starting under President George W. Bush, Washington rallied the international community around increasingly tough sanctions that would remain in place until Tehran comes clean about its nuclear program and the world could rest assured that it would not develop nuclear weaponry. To his credit, President Barack Obama led global efforts to further tighten the screws on Iran, which threatened that nation with economic collapse and coaxed Iranian leaders to the negotiating table. Nevertheless, the President now seems prepared to ink a deal that would put Iran on the cusp of nuclear weaponry and eventually lift all sanctions, raising the same specter of a very dangerous regime with the most dangerous weapons -- even though the regime has not changed its ideology, its motives, or its behavior in any significant way since the Islamic Republic was founded in 1979. As Obama has suggested in public comments, the administration envisions that, with a nuclear deal, Iran can emerge from the isolation in which the sanctions have put it and take its rightful place as a responsible player in the Middle East, working with other nations to stabilize the region. From its earliest days, however, and through two Supreme Leaders and multiple Presidents, the regime in Tehran has been expansionist in the region and beyond, destabilizing of its neighbors, murderous in its activities, and, most fundamentally, anti-American in its approach. ""Death to America"" has remained a popular chant at parliamentary sessions and government-orchestrated public rallies. Nothing of late suggests that Tehran will change for the better after a nuclear deal. In fact, a deal of the kind that U.S. and Iranian negotiators are pursuing, which will delay the onset of Iranian nuclear weaponry rather than prevent it, will give the regime greater leverage to pursue its dangerous activities. For starters, Iran remains the world's most aggressive state sponsor of terrorism, as our State Department continually attests, fueling the murderous efforts of Hezbollah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and other groups that have killed Americans, Europeans, Israelis, and others. And according to London's Asharq Al-Awsat, it has worked with al Qaeda since 2007 to target U.S. interests in Saudi Arabia and Dubai. Under the emerging deal, Iran has not vowed to stop sponsoring those groups. Indeed, nuclear weaponry will position Iran to even more effectively rebuff U.S. and other outside pressure to halt its terror sponsorship, and it will enable the regime, if it chooses, to put nuclear weapons in the hands of those groups. Meanwhile, Iran's leaders continue to threaten to eliminate Israel, the region's lone democracy and America's closest ally, and, under the emerging deal, Tehran has not promised to halt those threats. Nuclear weaponry, when combined with Iran's growing ballistic missile program (which the emerging deal will not affect), will position Tehran to make good on its threats -- or to hold that threat over Jerusalem when it seeks to confront Iran-backed terrorists who are launching rockets, building tunnels, or killing soldiers across its borders. Finally, Iran continues to pull out all stops to protect Syria's murderous dictator, Bashar al-Assad, by sending forces to help Syria's army fight the U.S.-backed rebels. It's also extending its reach in the region by, for instance, backing the anti-American Houthi rebels who recently overran Yemen's capital and forced its U.S.-backed President to resign. Iran, it seems, is unwilling to abandon its hegemonic dreams, which threaten America's position in the region. By better protecting Iran from outside pressure, a nuclear deal also will strengthen the regime at home, enabling it to further crack down on activists who seek a more democratic government. That, in turn, will extend the time during which the world's most dangerous weapons will remain in the hands of a regime that's driven by fervent anti-Americanism. By speeding blindly toward a deal, America's leaders are, put simply, ignoring the many real dangers that Tehran presents to U.S. interests.​ .","Lawrence Haas: Nuclear deal would strengthen Iranian regime at home .

"Walland, Tennessee (CNN)Jim Sanford and his dog Tom poked around the hazelnut grove on Blackberry Farm, a 9,200-acre luxury resort set in the foggy foothills of Tennessee, one Wednesday morning in December. They were on the hunt again, though not for deer or waterfowl or the usual Tennessee fare. The man and his curly-haired dog were searching for something fancier: Tuber melanosporum or black Périgord truffles. Black truffles are one of the most sought after (and expensive) delicacies in the world. Often referred to as a ""black diamond,"" the subterranean fungus can retail for $1,000 a pound or cost a diner upward of $75 extra for a simple shaving on a dish of creamy pasta or slow-scrambled eggs. Sanford and Tom's morning hunt proved fruitless. But the pair has had better luck than most sniffing out truffles on American soil -- a relatively new and wholly unpredictable ground for cultivation. ""This is not something where you just plant your trees and wait for your fortune to grow,"" Sanford said as Tom trotted behind him. Truffles are a funny fungus; they grow underground, typically among hazelnut and oak trees, and keep most of their secrets there with them. There is a primitive understanding of the climactic and soil conditions required for the fungus to flourish, but cultivation methods are far from foolproof. Stateside, those practices are in their infancy. Chefs such as Lachlan Mackinnon-Patterson of Frasca Food & Wine in Boulder, Colorado, certainly wouldn't mind sourcing truffles closer to home. He hosts an annual truffle dinner series and features them prominently in dishes when in season. Every year, he buys domestic truffles from budding regions like the Pacific Northwest, but the quality isn't as reliable as he'd like it to be. ""We're counting down the minutes,"" he said with a hopeful tone. ""Once it clicks, whether it's Blackberry or someone else, once there's a tipping point, it will really blow up."" Enthusiasts describe the truffle's olfactory Siren song, which is part of its allure, as ""dank,"" ""earthy,"" ""musky,"" ""pungent"" -- the gist is its aroma and taste are unparalleled. ""It transforms an otherwise ordinary dish into something very extraordinary,"" Sanford said. Different types of truffles are found all over the world, but the Périgord and white variety from Alba, Italy, are the top dogs of the gastronomic set. The elusive truffle hunt is often romanticized: Man and beast wander into the woods of southwest France with a shovel and a calling. A bird chips, a breeze flows and the storybook closes with ""happily ever after."" If only it were that simple. Until recently, the black truffle had been solely imported to the United States. Less than 100 miles away from Blackberry Farm -- in Chuckey, Tennesee, of all places -- that began to change around 2007. It all started with another Tom. Tom Michaels, who grew up mushroom hunting and wrote his Ph.D. dissertation at Oregon State University on black truffle cultivation, set his eyes on eastern Tennessee to try out his fungal knowhow in 1999. As if the truffle business doesn't sound risky enough, it takes about six to 10 years for a tree with roots that have been inoculated with truffle spores to potentially produce a truffle. The season for harvesting runs three months from December to February. ""I'll have done everything to two trees next to each other, and one will have truffles and one won't,"" Michaels said. Luckily for Michaels, something clicked. Soon, he showed up at the kitchen of Blackberry Farm's restaurants with his basket of epicurean delights and a brochure for Tennessee truffles, though it was only his third sale. The first question from proprietor Sam Beall: ""How come I didn't know about this?"" Beall and Michaels teamed up to seed and sniff out truffles locally. Enter the four-legged Tom, who was sourced by local breeder Hilarie Gibbs-Sykes from Italy to simplify the hunt. Sanford, a Blackberry employee for 14-plus years who had previously run the resort's horse program, was recruited to handle the truffle-hunting canine. At the height of Michaels's truffle business, Tom helped haul in 200 pounds in one season. ""It was a thousand dollars a pound so if you do the arithmetic, that's a good dog,"" Sanford said. In 2009, Michaels and his product were written up in GQ magazine, where food writer Alan Richman called it  the ""hillbilly truffle."" Two years earlier, storied New York Times food writer Molly O'Neill devoted an entire column titled ""Coveted, French, and Now in Tennessee"" to his endeavors. If we know anything about agriculture, though, it's that Mother Nature holds the reins. Michaels' hazelnut trees were hit with blight after his initial success, and he had to start over with a new blight-resistant variety. ""You have to have a temperament that can deal with a lot of anxiety for many years,"" Michaels, 67, said. Last year, Michaels yielded about 60 pounds on his land and sold the majority off to hyper-local ingredient-focused chefs such as Sean Brock in Charleston, South Carolina, and Linton Hopkins in Atlanta. This year, after a series of unseasonable cold snaps, and only a few days left in the season, he hasn't unearthed any truffles of sellable quality. ""Mother nature took its course,"" Michaels said with the matter-of-factness of someone who has been here before. Back at Blackberry Farm, Sanford's pin that read ""Truffle Dog Trainer"" reflected the sun as he crouched beneath a tree to dig up a truffle-scented practice tube that Tom found. On the days when there isn't any luck, training is a commitment to the cause. Blackberry found only one Périgord truffle last winter on its property. If it seems like a wild goose chase, that's because it is. But Tom is a Lagotto Romagnolo; he not only enjoys the chase -- it's in his DNA. According to the American Kennel Club, Tom's breed is the only one recognized as a ""specialized truffle searcher."" ""We wouldn't be talking about any of this if it wasn't for Tom,"" Sanford said. ""He has really put everything we're talking about in cultivating truffles in North America on the map."" Working like a dog at a Long Island vineyard . Now 13 years old, Tom is passing the baton through his bloodline by breeding and sharing his skills. He and Sanford travel around the country to help train other canines in areas like Oregon with an eye on the truffle prize. At Blackberry and every where else, they're hoping it's not a matter of if, but when, a consistent yield will happen. As they say, every dog will have its day.","American truffle production is in its infancy .

"(CNN)Everybody on the planet knows that Gene Roddenberry created Mr. Spock, the laconic, imperturbable extra-terrestrial First Officer for the Starship Enterprise. But Mr. Spock doesn't belong to Roddenberry, even though he is the grand exalted progenitor of everything that was, is, and forever will be ""Star Trek."" Mr. Spock belongs to Leonard Nimoy, who died Friday at age 83. And though he doesn't take Spock with him, he and Spock remain inseparable. Zachary Quinto, who plays Spock in the re-booted feature film incarnation of ""Trek,"" is excellent in the role. (Nimoy himself said so.) Quinto must know that however much he brings to the role, he will only be its custodian. Spock is Nimoy. Nimoy is Spock. It is, as Spock himself would intone, only logical. Nimoy often insisted otherwise, especially as the show went from canceled outcast to global phenomenon. He even wrote a book with the title, ""I Am Not Spock"" (1977) that was bought by millions of readers who didn't buy the title for a nanosecond. By 1995, he cried ""uncle"" by publishing a followup autobiography, ""I Am Spock."" In the years before and since, he carried his character's legacy with the grace and class he exhibited in other areas of his life. And the life of Leonard Nimoy, irrespective of Spock, was a rich and varied feast. Those two ""Spock"" books weren't the only things he'd published. A couple of books of poetry are also credited to him as were a collection of photographs celebrating what he termed ""the feminine aspect of God."" Which reminds me. Nimoy had a hand, so to speak, in creating one of Spock's most indelible traits: The ""live-long-and-prosper"" split-finger salute that Nimoy had borrowed from an approximation of the Hebrew letter shin, the first letter in the word Shaddai, one of the Hebrew names for God. Roddenberry didn't think of that. Nimoy did. And in doing so made an implausible character as much a part of our waking dreams as members of our own family. He also directed movies, two of which were part of the ""Trek"" franchise: 1984's ""The Search for Spock"" and 1986's ""The Voyage Home."" I got to meet him when the latter film opened. It was at a press conference that was part of the promotional junket in Los Angeles and Nimoy was very un-Spock-like in his jocular, freewheeling enthusiasm for the movie (which was, in fact, one of the very best, certainly the warmest, of the big-screen ""Trek"" iterations.) He could not stop smiling, not even when one of the reporters asked him about a scene in the film that catches Spock in an impromptu grin. (It vanished once the movie opened in theaters.) He looked like a man who knew he was going to soon have a lot more money than he'd had a week, or a day before -- though anyone with a brain knew he wasn't going to squander any of it on trivial things. He was Nimoy and he was Spock. And they were serious men with serious thoughts. Still, it was always nice to know Nimoy could smile, even if Spock couldn't.","Gene Seymour: Gene Roddenberry may have created ""Star Trek,"" but Leonard Nimoy and character of Spock are inseparable .
He says Nimoy had many other artistic endeavors, photography, directing, poetry, but he was, in the end, Spock ."
"New York (CNN)Screeds seized at the 2011 raid in which Osama bin Laden was killed outlined plans to unleash terror attacks in the U.S. heartland -- with hopes of pressuring ""300 million Americans"" to demand an end to what al Qaeda called the ""unjust wars"" against the Muslim world. ""Striking America at home is of the highest and top importance and is the main way to reach what we want,"" one letter said. ""The impact on Americans from a strike inside America cannot be compared with hitting them outside the country."" In a Brooklyn, New York, courtroom, a federal jury this week was the first to hear the contents of the letter and other documents seized during the bin Laden raid in Pakistan. The documents were read at the terrorism trial of a man named Abid Naseer, 28, who was arrested in 2009 in Manchester, England, where he had been living on a student visa. They were penned by senior al Qaeda operatives, according to prosecutors. Brooklyn federal prosecutor Celia Cohen described Naseer to the jury as a ""key member"" of a broad scheme to ""take innocent lives"" during a series of alleged failed attacks at a Manchester shopping center, a newsroom in Copenhagen and the subways of New York. Naseer is not mentioned in the al Qaeda documents. ""I had no involvement in the activities mentioned in those documents,"" Naseer told the jury Thursday. The release of the al Qaeda papers coincides with the arrests Wednesday of three Brooklyn men accused by the federal government of attempting to join ISIS and of fostering separate plans to kill President Barack Obama and shoot law enforcement officers. The declassified documents at times read like jihadi training manuals -- detailing operational tactics for terrorist assaults throughout the world while, at the same time, invoking the name of Allah. Written in Arabic, the documents were translated by an FBI linguist. Other letters stress the importance of strikes to not only hurt the American economy but the nation's sense of security. ""One of the most important tasks of the organization is to carry out operations that can directly affect the security and economy of the American people as a whole,"" one document said. ""Therefore, operations inside America and targeting oil overseas, especially in the countries that export it, will have the strongest and fastest impact on the people and will push them to exert pressure on the politicians."" There are references to American history, particularly the large protests generated by the huge loss of U.S. soldiers during the Vietnam War. ""We must put under direct pressure our enemy's Operations Room, which includes the Administration in the White House, Congress, and the Pentagon, and which is used to wage the war against us,"" said one letter. Another stated, ""One large operation inside America affects the security and nerves of 300 million Americans, whereas killing one thousand soldiers during eight years or more has a weak effect on their mental strain as a whole."" The 1941 attack on the naval base at Pearl Harbor occurred on an island far from the U.S. mainland, one letter noted. ""They have inherited the concept of security and the idea that no one would dare to attack them inside their home,"" it said of Americans. ""Their sense of security is very sensitive with regard to military operations inside their country, and for this reason it is easy for the matter to be magnified in their eyes, causing them to become angry, to rebel against their politicians, and to mobilize to stop the reasons behind their loss of security."" A document included an oath of loyalty that al Qaeda recruits swore to bin Laden. ""I accept your allegiance on behalf of Sheikh Osama, to listen and obey, in hardship and ease, and to follow whomever Sheikh Osama assigns to be my amir on the jihad for the sake of God, for the establishment of the religion of God, and to memorise secrets of the group and to be where I am ordered to,"" it said. Targets for operations included Britain and Russia. ""We had sent a number of brothers to Britain, Russia and Europe,"" one document said. ""We had confidence in them. These were Russia (hitting the gas line or the US Embassy) and Britain (several targets -- the brother determines what suites him in line with what materials he can get)."" The hazards of the terror trade were noted. ""We have many brothers who had spent a long time with us and who are ready to work anywhere,"" one letter said. ""Likewise, many brothers with security problems where the main deterrent is the issue of official documents."" Old and new ways to spread fear and carry out attacks were considered. ""Guide the brothers towards new methods like using the simplest things such as household knives, gas tanks, fuel, diesel and others like airplanes, trains and cars as killing tools,"" said a document, under the section headed ""execution."" ""Try to benefit from the brothers with previous criminal conviction to obtain weapons,"" it said. The al Qaeda papers released in the Naseer trial were found in the walled and fortified compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where Osama bin Laden was killed in 2011 by a group of U.S. forces, including Navy SEALs. Naseer is accused of providing and conspiring to provide material support to al Qaeda and conspiracy to use a destructive device in relation to the British plot. He faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if convicted. Prosecutors allege that Naseer received terrorist training in Pakistan and communicated with al Qaeda about the alleged plot using coded email messages under online addresses that appeared to belong to a female. The bearded defendant, who is representing himself, took the stand this week. He told the jury the charges against him were false and that he  concocted the email addresses to play pranks on friends and to meet women online. He said his emails were innocent and not coded. Naseer said he was in Britain looking for a wife, not planning an attack. He told jurors that he has ""no extremist or jihadi views"" or affiliation with any terrorist network. ""I do not condone 9/11,"" he said of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. ""The events of 9/11 are not justified in the name of Islam... I have never met Osama bin laden."" A major operation Naseer is accused of plotting was to happen on the 10th anniversary of 9/11, prosecutors said. The operation involved a bomb on the New York subway. The plot originated with a man named Najibullah Zazi, who allegedly cooperated with Naseer and pleaded guilty to terrorism charges. Zazi was the first witness in Naseer's trial. Naseer's 2009 arrest in England was part of a massive sweep in connection with an alleged plot to carry out bomb attacks in Britain. He was extradited in January 2013. A number of British intelligence agents -- disguised with makeup and wearing wigs -- testified that they tracked Naseer in 2009 as he visited a Manchester mall that was to be attacked. Another witness was an FBI official who was in Afghanistan and oversaw the trove of evidence collected in the bin Laden raid. The counterterror official, Alexander Otte, testified that he saw bin Laden's body as it arrived at a military hangar. ""I knew who he was,"" he said. ""I recognized him immediately.""

"(CNN)For five years, George Brainard was the official photographer for The Kontinentals, a car club based in Austin, Texas. He directed his camera toward the spring Lonestar Round Up, the club's car show with vintage ""hot rods"" and custom rides from all over the country. And he shot its fall Day of the Drags Race, photographing American-made cars created no later than 1963. Over time, the number of cars at the events increased from about 100 to 2,000. But it was the people, not the cool cars, that grabbed Brainard's interest and inspired his black-and-white photo book ""All Tore Up: Texas Hot Rod Portraits."" ""I find pictures of people more interesting than anything else,"" he said. ""The people at these car shows I just thought (were) really, really interesting and cool-looking, and so I wanted to capture that. Also, it was something that nobody else was doing. You know, there were a bunch of people taking pictures of the cars, but there was nobody who was really documenting the people and the culture in the way that I ended up doing."" When Brainard started creating these portraits, he used only white seamless paper as the backdrop. This later created weather-related challenges, such as movement from the wind. So he decided to paint a large piece of canvas white to use as the backdrop, and then he secured it to a box truck so it would stay in place. He also used a silk-lighting technique, stretching translucent fabric over a steel frame. ""(Silk lighting) just sort of softened the harsh sunlight, and that way I could get really pretty light all day so I wasn't just restricted to shooting in the early morning and late-afternoon hours,"" Brainard said. ""I could shoot any time. It just makes a really pretty soft light on the people."" Based on today's Internet culture and the efforts people make to maintain their privacy, Brainard was uncertain about what people's reactions would be to him wanting to create their portraits. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. ""I would just sort of hang out and watch people walk by,"" he said, ""and when there was somebody that I thought was interesting ... I would just walk up and ask them (for their portrait). ... Almost everybody said yes. It was kind of remarkable. I would photograph generally 80 or 100 people in a day, and I'd have maybe one or two people say, 'No thanks.' Almost everybody else said yes."" Making people feel at ease in front of the camera was especially important to Brainard. He always made an effort to engage in conversations with his subjects and briefly get to know them. He also used a 70-200 millimeter lens, allowing him to maintain a distance of about 20 feet from those he was photographing. This was essential to ensuring that each person felt a sense of comfort, because they were provided with their own personal space in which they could let their personalities radiate and reflect straight to the camera. ""I wouldn't direct (the people) much,"" he said. ""For the most part, I just told people where to stand and let them be themselves."" When creating each portrait, Brainard asked his subjects to write a description about themselves. From short captions -- such as merely ""drunk"" -- to quotes and page-length stories, the descriptions serve as the captions throughout his book. Much thought went into each of the 62 portraits included in the book, and together the portraits show a diverse selection of the people who have attended the events. However, the title of the book was just as important to Brainard, who generated ideas for the title with a friend. ""The idea of the title was that it was more like the title of a song,"" Brainard said. ""There's a real sort of musical aspect to this scene, and (my friend and I) liked the idea of the title being something that was more like a blues song and that would have that sort of energy to go along with this gritty, real, ultra-realism kind of feel."" From Brainard's portraits, it is evident that people themselves are like living works of art, externally embellished in expression and internally rich in history and meaning. One way of illustrating this is through Brainard's decision to shoot in black and white instead of color. ""I (feel) like the black and white here, I think that it sort of takes (people) out of reality a bit and makes them sort of more iconic,"" Brainard said. ""I like that it makes them look more like a piece of art. I think these portraits are almost sculptural in some ways. They're very simple, very direct, and I think the black and white helps with all of that."" Brainard is a sixth-generation Texan whose work has appeared in numerous publications and advertisements. A former working musician, Brainard has also shot more than 50 CD covers, and today he specializes in portraits. He said he has learned a tremendous amount from undertaking this project -- about everything from photography and creating photo books to working with people and making his subjects comfortable. ""In April is the big car show where I've taken a lot of these pictures,"" he said. ""I'm really looking forward to taking the book to that and to the people who are in the book and the people who are part of the culture seeing the book and getting their response."" ""All Tore Up: Texas Hot Rod Portraits"" is Brainard's first photo book and will be released on March 1. ""I would say the overall message of the book is ... about how we're all more similar than we are different and about the connection and real honesty and rawness in these images,"" he said. ""I feel like (the subjects) are really real, and it really comes across. I feel like they're very open with me in these pictures. I hope that (this) comes across to people.""

"(CNN)Christianity was born in Bethlehem, in what's now the West Bank. It took root among people like the Assyrians, who flourished in ancient Mesopotamia. It soon found a home in places like modern-day Turkey. In other words, Christianity traces its past squarely to the Middle East. But do Christians have a future there? Recent headlines provide ample evidence for skepticism. It's hard to ignore the depravity of ISIS beheading 21 Egyptian Christians on a beach in Libya. Nor can one shake off stories of women and children among the 262 Christians captured by ISIS in Syria, one of several horrors faced by Christians in that nation and neighboring Iraq. They're not just feeling the heat from Islamic extremists: Just this week, police in Jerusalem said they suspected radical right-wing Israelis were to blame for defacing a Greek Orthodox seminary in Jerusalem with slurs maligning Jesus. All this strain, all this chaos has shrunk the percentage of the Middle East's once-sizable population of openly practicing Christians. While no one is saying what's happening -- especially given the savagery of ISIS -- isn't alarming, that doesn't make it surprising. The Middle East has changed a lot since the first millennium A.D. for Christians. It has also changed a lot over the past century: The percentage of Christians relative to the Mideast's overall population has gone from 13.6% in 1910 to 4.2% in 2010, and it's expected to drop even further, according to religious demographers Todd Johnson and Gina Zurlo. ""What we're seeing right now,"" said Baylor University historical theologian Philip Jenkins, ""is the latest phase of something that has been going for 100 years, pretty much."" This isn't to say Christianity itself is dying out. It is growing in places like Africa, Asia, South America and -- believe it or not -- some of the most dogmatic, restrictive nations in the Middle East. This is thanks to migrants who travel from places like the Philippines and Africa to oil-rich countries where Islam is a state-sponsored faith. According to the World Religion Database, places like Qatar and Bahrain have seen their Christian ranks surge from basically nothing a century ago to 10% and 13% of their respective populations. Some of these countries are relatively permissive. The United Arab Emirates lets Christians do most everything but evangelize, for example, and Bahrain has top Christian and Jewish officials. On the other end of the spectrum is Saudi Arabia, which doesn't allow the practice of anything but Islam. Religious police in Saudi Arabia try to make sure that's the case. David Curry, whose nonprofit group Open Doors USA helps persecuted Christians in more than 60 countries, calls Saudi Arabia's control on religious matters ""complete."" ""You're not allowed to go to church, you're not allowed to have a Bible, you're not allowed to think for yourself,"" Curry said. Yet that hasn't stopped Christians from coming for a simple reason: jobs. They'll likely keep coming, with the World Religion Database projecting Saudi Arabia will have more than 1.5 million Christians by 2025. And they don't necessarily stop believing and professing their faith once they cross the border. ""There are home churches (where people are) practicing their faith in private,"" says Zurlo, who helps manage the database and is assistant director of the Center for the Study of Global Christianity. ""... Some of them come as guest workers, but they see themselves as missionaries."" Still, such migrant workers are in the shadows and under threat of deportation, and more, if caught praying openly or communally. They haven't been in the Middle East long, and there's no guarantee any one of them will stay long, either. That's in contrast to other Christian communities that have been in the Middle East for centuries. They're people like Assyrians, whose ancestors were part a cradle of modern civilization. They began converting to Christianity within years of Jesus' death and have kept the faith despite the growth of Islam in their homeland and, most shockingly, the Assyrian genocide of the 1910s and early 1920s. Now those Assyrians in Iraq and Syria are under fire again. Last August, ISIS militants overran Qaraqosh, a historic Assyrian community of about 50,000 people and Iraq's largest Christian city. And in recent days, the terrorist group stormed Assyrian villages in northeastern Syria, taking some 262 people hostage, said Assyrian Human Rights Network founder Osama Edward. Others fled for their lives, including about 600 taking refuge in St. Mary's Cathedral in al-Hasakah, Syria. ""We pray, we pray all the time,"" Romel David, who has 12 relatives thought to be among those kidnapped, told CNN affiliate KCRA. ""What we've heard is it was like a sea of black uniforms marching through all the villages, burning down the churches, desecrating the crosses and wreaking havoc."" ISIS has targeted other Christians in the region as well, like those in Mosul, Iraq, who were told last July to convert to Islam, pay a fine or face ""death by sword."" Curry calls ISIS' actions against Christians ""genocide."" Yet it shouldn't obscure the fact that, even before this group's emergence, the number of Iraqi Christians was on the decline. Some of that's due to a weak Iraqi central government and general instability. Christians might also be hurt by their historic affiliation with the Baath Party, once led by deposed Saddam Hussein (with the Syrian branch led by embattled President Bashar al-Assad). Another factor is the rise of militias and politicians who make Islam more central to their missions, to the exclusion of others. Curry, from Open Doors USA, said Iraq had about 1.5 million Christians just over a decade ago. That number is now under 150,000, something that he attributes to family influences, government actions, communal pressure and targeted violence from militant groups. ""In 10 years from now,"" Jenkins added, ""I expect Christians in Iraq will be gone."" A Pew Research Center report released this week found that, in 2013, that Christians faced harassment in 102 countries. Muslims got similar treatment in 99 nations, and Jews faced harassment in 77, a seven-year high. Five of the 18 countries with ""very high government restrictions on religion"" were in the Mideast, according to the same study. That means that groups like Christians have a tough time in that region, but it's not the only place nor are they the only ones persecuted. And there isn't anything novel about people of one faith being pitted against another. Still, even when strife involves people from different religions, that doesn't mean the discord is all about faith. It can also be about power, with leaders using religion in part to curry popular support and lure recruits. Jenkins notes a ""combination of religious hatred and organized crime"" is particularly dangerous, as when hostages are held for ransom or ""tax"" revenues are solicited from minorities. When this happens, any ""other"" group -- Christians included -- can become a target. ISIS and its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, are prime examples. Religion for them is almost a means to an end, as a way to create a sense of superiority, rationalize violence and spawn an ""us vs. them"" mentality while reaping rewards and amassing territory, said John Esposito, the founder of Georgetown University's Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding. ""You appeal to religion both to legitimize what you're doing and to mobilize people,"" Esposito said. So what can be done about Christians' plight in the Middle East? Some of it likely can't be helped, according to Zurlo. With or without ISIS, their number will continue to fall -- something the Massachusetts-based religious demographer asserts is ""not very unusual in the history of Christianity."" ""Christianity has a serial nature: It goes in an area and it thrives, then it (declines),"" Zurlo said. ""It thrived in the Middle East for a very long time."" According to Esposito, one key to slowing this drop or, at least, to making life easier for those Christians who want to be in the Mideast is changing the Muslim world. A vast majority of Muslims denounce extremists like ISIS, but there are still enough who join such groups because they're angry at their government or others and do not feel they have any better outlet or purpose. When that happens, it's bad for Christians. ""To prevent the recruits, you have to get at the root causes,"" said Esposito, a former consultant to U.S. and other governments. ""And even if you wipe out ISIS, unless those conditions change, you're going to have other groups that emerge.""","Christianity has long roots in the Middle East, starting with the birth of Jesus .
Expert: Their numbers have fallen in recent decades and should continue to fall .
There are exceptions, like migrant workers flooding Gulf states like Saudi Arabia ."
"(CNN)Mexican authorities have detained Servando Gomez, leader of the Knights Templar drug cartel, federal police told CNN En Español on Friday. Gomez was detained early Friday in Morelia, the capital of the state of Michoacan, about 135 miles (217 kilometers) west of Mexico City, authorities said. The Knights Templar drug organization has operated for years in Michoacan, in central-western Mexico. The Mexican government has accused it of involvement in drug trafficking, killings, kidnappings and extortion. Michoacan has long been a flashpoint in Mexico's drug war. In the past year or so, it has been the scene of fighting between the Knights Templar and vigilante groups that have armed themselves and patrolled the streets. The vigilante groups grew from complaints that the government was not doing enough to protect citizens from the cartel. The government acted last year, providing the groups a path to becoming recognized after first calling for them to disarm. The Mexican government also sent forces to the region. Authorities in Mexico said last year that the presence of Mexican troops had weakened the Knights Templar.","Police say they arrested the leader of a drug gang in west-central Mexico .

"Liz Cheney, whose upstart bid to unseat Wyoming Sen. Mike Enzi sparked warfare in the Republican Party and within her own family, is dropping out of the primary race, she said on Monday. ""Serious health issues have recently arisen in our family, and under the circumstances, I have decided to discontinue my campaign,"" the eldest daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney said in a written statement. Cheney, 47, began telling associates of her decision over the weekend, CNN reported  Sunday night. She was not specific about the health issues involved in her decision. But CNN has learned from multiple sources close to the family that they involve at least one of her children. ""Though this campaign stops today, my commitment to keep fighting with you and your families for the fundamental values that have made this nation and Wyoming great will never stop,"" she added. Cheney called Enzi, 69, about her decision to bow out. ""I talked to her first thing this morning. It was very nice that she called me,"" he told CNN on Capitol Hill, adding that he respects Cheney's decision and that ""she and her family are in our prayers."" Asked if he was relieved that she was no longer in the race, he said he hasn't ""had a chance to reflect on that yet."" Cheney's surprising decision to jump into the race, an announcement made in a YouTube video last summer, roiled Republican politics in Wyoming, a state that her father represented in Congress for five terms in the 1970s and 80s. Enzi is a low-key presence in Washington in the Senate. He was elected in 1996 and has amassed a conservative voting record with few blemishes. He expressed public annoyance at Cheney's decision to mount a primary challenge. A number of his Senate colleagues quickly rallied to his side and pledged support for his re-election bid. There was little public polling of the race, but two partisan polls released last year showed Enzi with a wide lead, an assessment mostly shared by GOP insiders watching the race. In a statement after her announcement to drop out, the Wyoming Republican Party praised Liz Cheney for being a ""stalwart supporter"" and fundraiser for Wyoming candidates and county parties in the past. ""Liz is a rising star in Wyoming and national politics and we look forward to her return when the time is right for her and her family,"" the statement read. Cheney's campaign got off to a rocky start. Her critics labeled her a carpetbagger, noting that she moved to Wyoming only in 2012 after relocating from Virginia. The issue flared in August after the Wyoming media reported that Cheney improperly received a fishing license despite not living in the state for at least a year, as the law requires. Grabbing even more attention was her very public dispute with her sister, Mary, over the issue of same-sex marriage. Mary Cheney, who is a lesbian, took to Facebook in November to object to Liz Cheney's opposition to same-sex marriage, claiming that her sister has previously supported her relationship while saying something very different on the campaign trail. The dispute prompted their parents to weigh in, saying they were ""pained"" to see the sisters battle over a private matter in full view of the news media. Beyond the campaign missteps, Cheney's election effort, vigorously supported by her father and his allies, often felt out of tune with the small-government conservative sentiment that has fueled other Republican primary challengers. Cheney, like her father, is an unapologetic neoconservative who favors muscular use of American military power overseas, a policy that does not sit well with many grassroots conservatives, particularly in the libertarian-leaning West.

"A Salvador Dali etching that was anonymously donated to Goodwill fetched $21,005 in an online auction, the nonprofit said Tuesday. The money will fund 12 scholarships to provide job training to people with disabilities and disadvantages, said Amanda Bedell, spokeswoman for Goodwill Industries in Tacoma, Washington. The buyer, identified only as an East Coast man by Goodwill, said that he and his wife are interested in Dali's work. ""We saw the Dali on the news and thought it would be a great way to add to our collection while supporting a great cause,"" he said in a statement. ""We donate to Goodwill all the time and are very happy that our purchase is helping those in need."" Earlier this month, an anonymous donor dropped off the framed Dali piece at the Goodwill facility in Federal Way, Washington. The work by the master surrealist is a colored etching, and the framed piece even features the familiar Dali motif of a melting watch placed on the wrist of a pointing hand. Its title is ""Reflection"" or ""Reflections,"" from ""The Cycles of Life Suite,"" and the art is signed by Dali and numbered ""126/150."" The work is also labeled as an ""etching and photolithography from collage."" Goodwill auctioned the art on its website, and bidding ended Monday night. Goodwill doesn't know who the donor is. He or she managed to sneak away during a busy time at the drop-off facility, the organization said. But the donor kept intact the back of the frame, which contained an envelope with a certificate of authenticity and registration number from a defunct gallery in North Hollywood, California. An appraiser retained by Goodwill also confirmed the authenticity of the Dali, and the charitable organization also ensured the art had not been stolen, Bedell said. The nonprofit provides employment and training programs to people with disabilities and disadvantages, and the group sells donated goods in more than 2,600 stores. Goodwill held on to the Dali for a week in case someone claimed it had been donated accidentally, Bedell said. ""We don't know the background of what the circumstances were,"" Bedell said of the donation. ""It's a steady stream of people coming in. It's not necessarily documented what every person comes in with."" About 74 million people in the United States and Canada donate annually to Goodwill, Bedell said. Most donated goods are sold at Goodwill stores, but prizes such as the Dali are auctioned online to maximize their value, said Shea Munroe, who works for Goodwill's online department in Federal Way. The Dali was the highlight of Munroe's past six years of working for the nonprofit, in addition to her two years of service in the 1970s, she said. But the Dali piece is not the most prized art auctioned by Goodwill: A Frank Weston Benson oil painting, dated 1924 and also donated anonymously, was sold online by Goodwill in 2006 for $165,002.","Sold!

"A 2,700 year-old silver chalice may be a new token of friendship between the United States and Iran, at least that's the way Iran's cultural heritage chief sees it. Whatever the case, Mohammad-Ali Najafi was palpably delighted Friday to see the ancient Persian artifact return to its homeland. The ceremonial drinking vessel -- or rhyton -- had gotten snagged in a U.S. customs warehouse for years, held up by bad diplomatic relations. It had been in New York since 2003, when an art dealer smuggled it into the country from Iran. Customs officials have long wanted to return the rhyton to Iran, according to a New York Post report. But decades of frigid relations between Washington and Tehran kept it frozen in bureaucratic limbo. Winning hearts . President Obama broke that ice Friday with a historic phone chat with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, as the Islamic republic's leader was just about to leave the United States. It was the first time a U.S. president has spoken to his Iranian counterpart since 1979. The thaw may have been enough to free up the rhyton, which takes the shape of a mythical beast with the body of a lion and the head of a bird of prey. It was fashioned in the Achaemenid era, the early Persian Empire, around 700 BC. The State Department announced in a tweet that the United States returned it this week. U.S. officials handed it off directly to Najafi's delegation, he said. ""We are taking this as America's souvenir to the Iranian people,"" Najafi told CNN. A souvenir from abroad is something Iranians don't take as trivial. It has a special place of warmth in Persian culture. He will present it Saturday to the nation after he lands in Tehran.  ""I believe this will have a very positive affect on the Iranians,"" he said. And what wins Najafi's heart has a good chance of pleasing Iran's new president. Hassan Rouhani recently appointed Najafi as one of a dozen vice presidents, making him the guardian of the country's most important museums and cultural institutions. Najafi, himself a progressive reform politician, who has run for office in the past, accompanied Rouhani to New York, where the Iranian president spoke at the United Nations General Assembly. Cultural charm offensive . In their phone conversation, the two presidents spoke about Tehran's nuclear program, Obama said. ""Resolving this issue, obviously, could also serve as a major step forward in a new relationship between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran."" It will be a long path to restored relations, the president said, but it could lead to the end of crippling economic sanctions against Iran, which could help ""the Iranian people fulfill their potential."" If Najafi has his way that potential will include the exchange with the United States of a lot of art, artifacts and archeology -- set to classical music. ""I adamantly believe in cultural diplomacy, and I believe the thing that could improve relations between US and Iran after the years and softens the harshness of this relationship is cultural diplomacy,"" he said. He appears to have already kicked off a cultural charm offensive towards the United States in his short time in office. Najafi has met with officials from New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art about potential exhibitions of Iranian artifacts, he said. He has parlayed with academics from the near Eastern studies program of University of Chicago. ""We agreed to have a joint program in future studies and research on these artifacts."" As far as Najafi is concerned, the times of extreme tension between the countries are over. ""Mr. Rouhani, in an event held for Iranians last night (Thursday) specifically said that 'the ice between Iran and US has been melted,' and I think if this is accurate, which I'm certain that it is, we will have no problems in the areas of education, sciences and culture in the next few months."" Najafi is also interested in seeing the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra play next year in Tehran. If they can pull it off, he said, the concert would mark the 50th anniversary of the last time the orchestra played there. If the diplomatic tone makes the music, Najafi seems eager to strike up the orchestra.","A 2,700 year-old silver chalice may be a new token of friendship between the United States and Iran .

"(CNN)Four cases of measles have been linked to a restaurant at the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, the Southern Nevada Health District reported Friday. A patron and two staff members of Emeril's New Orleans Fish House probably contracted measles from a contagious staff member, the health agency said Friday in a press release, bringing to nine the total number of people diagnosed with measles this year in Clark County, Nevada. An infant too young to have received the immunization may have transmitted measles to the initial Emeril's staff member, the health district said. One-hundred fifty-four cases of measles were discovered in the United States from January 1 to February 20, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on its website. The CDC said 118 cases were part of an ongoing, multistate outbreak linked to DisneyLand in California. A record number of U.S. measles cases -- 644 cases from 27 states -- were reported in 2014. That's the greatest number since measles elimination was documented in the United States in 2000. The Southern Nevada Health District said no measles cases had been reported in its district since 2011. Measles is a highly communicable respiratory disease caused by a virus and spread through the air, according to the CDC. Measles starts with a fever, runny nose, cough, red eyes and sore throat, the CDC said. Emeril's put out a press release Friday, saying, ""One of our team members was potentially contagious while working shifts beginning at 4 p.m. on Wednesday, February 18, Thursday, February 19, Friday, February 20, and Saturday, February 21. The affected employee has not been on site since then. ... In addition to the ongoing education of our staff, we are engaging in a cooperative effort with the health district to provide immunizations to all of our employees who believe they might be at risk."" People who dined at the restaurant on those days, as well as people who dined after 4 p.m. on February 4-7, should review their immunization status and contact their doctors if they are not fully immunized or haven't already had measles, the health district said. The health district said a person with one of the newly identified cases visited two other Las Vegas businesses, a Walgreens and a Chili's Grill & Bar, on February 22. BART, the transit system in the San Francisco area, on Wednesday said some riders may have been exposed last week after a San Mateo County resident with measles commuted. BART said the risk of ""contracting measles via BART is negligible.""

"Moscow  (CNN)Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was shot and killed Friday night in central Moscow, the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation said in a statement Saturday, prompting immediate speculation from fellow opposition figures that the killing was targeted. A deputy prime minister in the late 1990s under President Boris Yeltsin, Nemtsov had been one of current President Vladimir Putin's most vocal critics. Putin quickly condemned the killing of Nemtsov and expressed his condolences to his family, the Kremlin said. Putin also ordered three law enforcement agencies to put together a task force to investigate the shooting, Russian news agency Itar-Tass reported. A criminal case has been opened for murder and weapons trafficking, the investigative committee said. Nemtsov was a top official with the Republican Party of Russia/Party of People's Freedom, a liberal opposition group. He had most recently been critical of the Kremlin's handling of the Ukraine crisis. Opposition leader Ilya Yashin said his friend had been working on a report about Russian troops and their involvement in Ukraine. Nemtsov's death comes two days before a large opposition rally was set to take place in Moscow. Nemtsov had earlier Friday done a radio interview putting out the call to people to turn out for the rally Sunday. After his death, party leaders decided to hold a mourning march in downtown Moscow, Itar-Tass reported. Nemtsov was walking with a female friend just before midnight across a bridge that can be seen from the Kremlin, when a car pulled up and someone opened fire. The area in the center city is normally busy on a Friday night, though the weather was cold and wet. Investigators were talking with his companion, a friend from Ukraine who wasn't wounded, early Saturday. A CNN crew also observed white cars being pulled over by authorities near the scene of the shooting. Putin said he suspected it was a contract hit meant to cause political discord, according to the President's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov. A man like Nemtsov had many enemies, experts said. Nemtsov, 55, had been arrested several times in the past for speaking against Putin's government. The most recent arrests were in 2011 when he protested the results of parliamentary elections and in 2012 when tens of thousands protested against Putin. In a restaurant interview with CNN's Anthony Bourdain last year he lamented the situation for business owners. ""This is a country of corruption. And if you have business, you are in a very unsafe situation. Everybody can press you and destroy your business. That's it,"" Nemtsov said. In the same interview, he did offer a bit of optimism. ""This is my country. The Russian people are in bit of trouble. Russian court doesn't work. Russian education decline every year. I believe that Russia has a chance to be free. Has a chance. It's difficult, but we must do it,"" he said. Nemtsov was also a vocal critic of the 2014 Winter Olympics held in Sochi.  He published a report in 2013 describing the Sochi games as one of the most ""outrageous swindles"" in recent Russian history. He claimed that up to 60% of the final cost -- or $30 billion -- had been embezzled. World chess champion-turned opposition activist Garry Kasparov tweeted extensively about Nemtsov's death. ""When we argued, Boris would tell me I was too hasty, that in Russia you had to live a long time to see change. Now he'll never see it. RIP,"" he wrote in one. Nemtsov's lawyer Vadim Prokhorov told Russian media that Nemtsov's life had been threatened on social media in recent weeks. But he didn't walk around with bodyguards, noted Julia Ioffe, a contributing writer to The New York Times Magazine who has covered Russian politics extensively. ""It was a very overt message of bravery,"" Ioffe told CNN's ""AC360."" ""What we've seen in return is a very overt message of fear. People in the opposition will not believe anything that comes out of the Kremlin in terms of who did this. They perceive this as a message directly sent to them. When you see Boris Nemtsov's body lying with the Kremlin as a backdrop, they understand that's a message directed to them."" Critics like Yashin and Kasparov pointed fingers in the direction of Putin or a supporter of the Russian President. ""It's clearly a political murder. It's definitely a contract one,"" Yashin said. ""I don't know who killed Boris, but I know that it's the government and personally Putin who are responsible for it. They've been constantly promoting a hatred towards everyone who doesn't support their course and thinks different."" It's something even Nemtsov himself had said he had thought about, acknowledging in an interview with Russian newspaper Sobesednik this month that he was ""a little bit"" afraid his mother's fears Putin would have him killed would come true. But, he added, ""I'm not afraid of him that much.  If I was afraid I wouldn't be heading an opposition party and do what I'm doing."" Kasparov said the Russian President is to blame even if not directly involved. ""If Putin gave order to murder Boris Nemtsov is not the point. It is Putin's dictatorship. His 24/7 propaganda about enemies of the state,"" Kasparov tweeted. ""In Putin's atmosphere of hatred & violence, abroad & in Russia, bloodshed is the prerequisite to show loyalty, that you are on the team,"" he added. Critics of Putin have in the past suffered miserable circumstances and demises. Last year,  a Moscow court sentenced five men to prison for the 2006 killing of Russian journalist and fierce Kremlin critic Anna Politkovskaya. Oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky accused Putin of corruption and wound up spending 10 years in prison and labor camps. Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko accused state security services of organizing a coup to put Putin in power. He was poisoned by a lethal dose of radioactive polonium and died in London in 2006. No killer has been caught. ""It's the latest in a series of high-profile killings of people who have been critics of  authorities in Russia over the last few years,"" said Peter Baker, the author of ""Kremlin Rising. ""We don't know yet, of course, who did this or why, but it will certainly send a terrible message to people who are fighting this cause Nemtsov has been fighting."" But Baker also said there might not be a political connection to the killing. ""In Russia there's always multiple layers, things we don't see,"" he said. ""You can't rule out (a reason we don't know about)."" Even if it wasn't a political hit, it will still have strong political ramifications, he added. U.S. President Barack Obama called for an impartial investigation and praised the deceased leader. ""Nemtsov was a tireless advocate for his country, seeking for his fellow Russian citizens the rights to which all people are entitled.  I admired Nemtsov's courageous dedication to the struggle against corruption in Russia and appreciated his willingness to share his candid views with me when we met in Moscow in 2009,"" Obama said in a written statement from the White House. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said Saturday ""it is hard to believe"" that Nemtsov was killed. ""I have no doubt that the murderers will be brought to justice. Sooner or later. Rest in peace,"" Poroshenko said via Twitter. Baker, who also is a New York Times reporter, told CNN that Nemtsov used to be powerful but had been marginalized since Putin was elected. ""He was a person who had been fierce in his criticism of Putin. He'd clearly gotten under Putin's skin on a number of occasions. A number of people had become his enemies,"" Baker said.""There's a culture of suspicion and conspiracy in Russia, so even if in fact this had nothing to do with authority, nothing to do with a power element, a good number of people in Russia and around the world will find this suspicious."" Baker said Nemtsov tried to work with Putin's regime at first but soon switched to the opposition. ""History will remember him as someone who took chances, who risked his life literally to speak out in a country where speaking out is not encouraged, to say he least,"" Baker said. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen and Alla Eshchenko reported from Moscow. CNN's Steve Almasy wrote and reported from Atlanta.

"(CNN)The Pakistan Taliban claimed responsibility for a Friday attack on a Shiite Muslim mosque in Peshawar in northwestern Pakistan -- a suicide bombing and gunfire assault that a hospital representative said killed 19 people. The Islamist militant group said the attack was orchestrated by a commander who was behind December's massacre of 145 people, including 132 children, at a Peshawar school. Sixty-seven people were injured Friday, said Tauheed Zulfiqar, a representative of the Hayatabad Medical Complex in Peshawar. The Pakistan Taliban attacked the mosque, spokesman Muhammad Khurasan said in an email to CNN, as revenge for the government's December 19 execution of a militant who was allied with the group. Up to five attackers executed the assault, including a suicide bomber and someone who was shooting in the mosque, Nasir Khan Durrani, the city's police inspector general, told reporters. One would-be suicide bomber was stopped by people in the mosque who held him by the throat, Durrani said. Pakistan has seen plenty of violence, much of it involving militants targeting restive regions in northwest Pakistan along the border with Afghanistan. It is the home base of the Pakistan Taliban, known as the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, which seeks to enforce its conservative version of Islam in that nation. The group has battled Pakistani troops and attacked civilians, including in Peshawar, an ancient city of more than 3 million people. Khurasan, the TTP spokesman, said the attack was orchestrated by TTP commander Kalifa Omar Mansoor. The militant group and the Pakistani army said previously that Mansoor commanded the December 16 massacre at the Army Public School and Degree College, which largely teaches sons and daughters of army personnel from around Peshawar. In the school attack, gunmen burst in and gunned down children and staff, including in an auditorium filled with students taking exams. Khurasan said Friday's mosque attack was revenge for the government's December 19 execution of Mohammed Aqeel, a man condemned in part for his role in an attack on an army headquarters in 2009. Aqeel was a member of a militant group allied with the TTP. CNN's Jason Hanna, Faith Karimi and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Gunmen and a suicide bomber attack a mosque in Peshawar, police say .

"(CNN)His voice became hauntingly familiar as the masked man with a British accent who appeared repeatedly in brutal beheading videos from ISIS. But the identity of ""Jihadi John"" remained a mystery -- until Thursday, when two U.S. officials and two U.S. congressional sources confirmed it. The man, the officials said, is Mohammed Emwazi, a Kuwaiti-born Londoner. The officials, who've been briefed on the matter, spoke to CNN after a Washington Post report first revealed Emwazi's identity. Emwazi is believed to have traveled to Syria in 2012, according to the newspaper, and later to have joined ISIS there. Even with a name and face for the man behind the mask, uncertainty still swirled Thursday. London police and British officials declined to confirm his identity. Officials from a London-based human rights and Muslim advocacy organization who've interacted with Emwazi said they couldn't be 100% certain it was him. And a key question remained unanswered: What inspired him to join ISIS? The answer depends on who you ask. Some terrorism experts said Emwazi's history shows someone who'd been on a path toward extremism for years. But CAGE, the London advocacy group that worked with him, said if he is the man who's appeared in ISIS videos, it's a sign that British authorities' tactics pushed him to radicalize. Emwazi was born in Kuwait in 1988 and moved to the United Kingdom when he was 6 years old, CAGE said on its website. He studied at the University of Westminster in London and graduated in 2009 with a degree in computer programming, the group said. Emwazi, according to CAGE, ""hoped that with this degree, he could build a successful career in Arab countries, as he was fluent in Arabic, English and had a British accent."" Did something change to send him on a different path? According to the Washington Post, friends of Emwazi said they believed his path to radicalization began when he went on a trip to the East African nation of Tanzania in 2009. He was supposed to be going on safari there, but was reportedly detained on arrival, held overnight and then deported. He was also detained by counterterrorism officials in Britain in 2010, the Post said. Authorities haven't provided any reasons behind those reported detentions. London police declined to confirm the reported identity. ""We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk,"" said Cmdr. Richard Walton of the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command. ""We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation."" A UK Foreign Office spokeswoman told CNN: ""We will neither confirm nor deny the current reporting as to the identity of Jihadi John."" There are ""striking similarities"" between Emwazi and the man known as ""Jihadi John,"" according to Asim Qureshi, CAGE's research director. Qureshi told reporters Thursday that he couldn't be 100% certain that Emwazi is Jihadi John because the man's face is covered in the videos. But Qureshi said the man he knew was very different than the merciless figure from ISIS videos. Emwazi was a ""polite"" and ""beautiful young man"" who would drop into the CAGE office with treats to thank the group for helping him. Emwazi came to CAGE in 2009 looking for support when he felt that British authorities were -- in Qureshi's words -- ""harassing"" him. If Emwazi is indeed Jihadi John, Qureshi said, that makes him sad. But in some ways, he said, it's not surprising. ""It's hard to imagine the trajectory, but it's not a trajectory that's unfamiliar,"" he said. Many Muslims feel alienated in their society, like Emwazi did, he said. ""When are we going to finally learn if we treat people as if they're outsiders ... they will look for belonging elsewhere?"" Qureshi said. ""Our entire national security strategy for the last 13 years has only increased alienation."" The Washington Post's report includes emails Emwazi purportedly wrote after British counterterrorism officials detained him and stopped him from flying to Kuwait. ""I had a job waiting for me and marriage to get started,"" he wrote in a June 2010 email to Qureshi, the Post reported. But now ""I feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London. A person imprisoned & controlled by security service men, stopping me from living my new life in my birthplace & country, Kuwait,"" the email said. CAGE points the finger at British security services, who they say have ""systematically engaged in the harassment of young Muslims, rendering their lives impossible and leaving them with no legal avenue to redress their situation."" Haras Rafiq, managing director of the Quilliam Foundation, a UK-based counter-extremism think tank, said the advocacy group was pointing the finger in the wrong direction. It's clear Emwazi had been radicalized before 2010, he said. And, according to Rafiq, intelligence agencies who stopped Emwazi traveling to Tanzania believed there was evidence that he intended to join the extremist group Al-Shabaab in Somalia. Haras added that it was ""very upsetting that an organization like CAGE would spin this in the way that they've done,"" by blaming intelligence agencies. Former CIA counterterrorism analyst Philip Mudd told CNN that blaming radicalization on alienation was oversimplifying Emwazi's story. ""We're only seeing half of this story,"" he said. ""The government doesn't spend the resources and take the risk, the legal risk of pulling somebody aside, preventing them from traveling, searching through their luggage, just because somebody looks funny. There is something else going on here in terms of whatever triggered the government to undertake this investigation that we're missing here."" The masked, black-clad figure believed to be Jihadi John appeared to be the ISIS militant shown in a video last month demanding a $200 million ransom to spare the lives of two Japanese journalists. A similar figure appeared in at least five previous hostage videos. U.S. and British officials have previously said they believed they knew who the man was, but weren't disclosing the information publicly. That could be because Western intelligence agencies believed they had more to gain from keeping quiet, Aki Peritz, a former CIA officer, told CNN last month. ""They can put pressure on his family, put pressure on his friends,"" he told CNN. ""Maybe they have a line to him. Maybe they know who his cousins are who are going to Syria who can identify him. However, if you publicly tell everybody who he is, his real identity, then maybe he'll go to ground and he'll disappear."" The man's reported background gives some clues as to why he might have been recruited, said Sajjan Gohel, director of international security at the Asia Pacific Foundation. ""We know that ISIS recruits a lot of Westerners who are skilled in new media, understanding of the Internet, because they use that as their platform as an oxygen of publicity,"" he said. But by not revealing his name for operational reasons, one expert said, officials may have created another problem. ""It created more speculation in the media,"" he said. ""In some ways, the nom de guerre of Jihadi John gave this individual a form of notorious celebrity."" Opinion: Why 'Jihadi John' is so worrying .

"(CNN)Astronauts on the International Space Station will make a spacewalk Sunday despite the appearance of water inside an astronaut's helmet after a spacewalk earlier this week, NASA reported Friday on its website. NASA said the suit worn by NASA astronaut Terry Virts has a history of ""sublimator water carryover."" Water in the sublimator cooling component can condense when the suit is repressurized after a spacewalk, causing a small amount of water to push into the helmet, NASA said. NASA said International Space Station managers had ""a high degree of confidence"" in the suit. On the upcoming spacewalk, Virts and Barry Wilmore will install antennas to provide data to visiting vehicles and deploy 400 feet of cable along the edge of the station. Virts said he first noticed traces of fluid and dampness in his helmet  Wednesday while he was waiting for the crew lock cabin to repressurize in the International Space Station. He and Wilmore had been outside  the space station for nearly seven hours working on the station's robotic arm and performing some maintenance. Virts immediately alerted  fellow astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti about the water and she alerted Mission Control in Houston. Cristoforetti helped Virts out of his helmet and examined it.  She confirmed the presence of moisture, mostly in the helmet absorption pad, or HAP, describing it as ""wet and cold."" At the request of Mission Control, Anton Shkaplerov used a syringe to draw as much water as he could from the top of the helmet.  Water had collected in the white plastic at the top and around both ear cups.  Shkaplerov estimated there was 15 milliliters of water in the helmet. That's a far cry from the amount of water that accumulated in Luca Parmitano's suit during a spacewalk in July 2013.  Between 1 and 1.5 liters of water backed up in the suit and helmet, prompting fears Parmitano could drown in his own helmet.  The spacewalk was cut short and NASA implemented some changes to its suits, including the addition of absorbent padding in helmets. There was another intrusion of water into the helmet during another spacewalk on December 24, 2013.  NASA commentator Rob Navias said it was noticed at the same point in the mission as Wednesday's leak -- during the repressurization of the crew lock, the area from which astronauts enter and exit ISS while in space.","NASA says International Space Station astronauts will make a spacewalk on Sunday .

"(CNN)Jordan's King Abdullah II told CNN that he didn't watch the video of a pilot captured by ISIS being burned to death, calling it propaganda that has backfired on the terrorist group. In an exclusive television interview, his first since Lt. Moath al-Kasasbeh was killed, the King told CNN's Fareed Zakaria that the video was ISIS grabbing a ""tiger by the tail."" ""And it just motivated Jordanians to sort of rally around the flag, and the gloves have come off,"" King Abdullah said in  Amman. ""Actually the barbarity of the way they executed our brave hero I think shocked the Muslim world -- and specifically Jordanians and people from this region."" King Abdullah said that though he didn't see the video, the pictures in the papers of the killing were inescapable. And he was briefed by aides who had watched the video. He was filled with disgust and sadness for the pilot's family, he said. He said ISIS tries to appeal to ""deluded young men and women"" who believe they are becoming part of a caliphate, or Islamic state. It's a false link, King Abdullah said. It ""has no truth or bearing to our history,"" he said. He called for a unified response to the ISIS threat. ""I've said this to leaders, both in the Islamic and Arab world and to the world in general, this is a third World War by other means,"" he said. ""This brings Muslims, Christians, other religions together in this generational fight that all of us have to be in this together."" There are three components to the fight: a military response, a security response and an ideological response, he said. Changing minds, he said, will be the long-term element of the battle.

"(CNN)Catwoman has been an arch-nemesis for Batman for 75 years, becoming an antihero over time and spinning off into her own comic book series. But it turns out we didn't know all there is to know about Selina Kyle, aka Catwoman. This week's ""Catwoman"" #39 comic revealed that Selina is bisexual. (Like CNN, DC Comics is owned by Time Warner.) Comic book writer Genevieve Valentine penned a blog post explaining the scene in which Selina is seen kissing Eiko Hasigawa, who has taken on the mantle of Catwoman in recent months, while Selina has taken on the role of a crime boss. ""She's flirted around it -- often quite literally -- for years now,"" she wrote. ""For me, this wasn't a revelation so much as a confirmation."" However, fans who like her flirtation with Batman will not be let down, according to Valentine. ""Please be assured that Selina's longstanding connection to Batman has not been forgotten; that is not how bisexuality (or humanity) works,"" she wrote. Valentine has been building toward this moment in the comic's storyline and saw the character of Eiko as a good opportunity to establish Catwoman's sexuality once and for all. ""Eiko has offered a moral challenge -- and we know Selina loves a challenge -- but has also unexpectedly given Selina trust and support at a time when those are in desperately short supply,"" she wrote. ""Selina is a complicated person; she's drawn to complicated people. In some ways, it's that simple ... though of course, it's never simple."" In 2004, Catwoman was awarded a GLAAD media award for its portrayal of the character Holly Robinson as openly gay. Batwoman was reintroduced as a lesbian character in 2006 (her series is coming to an end soon). Fans reacted quickly on Twitter once the news of Catwoman's sexuality came out.","Catwoman is confirmed as a bisexual character in the most recent issue of her comic book .

"(CNN)The Afghan girl whose arresting green eyes made her face known around the world in 1985 has resurfaced, this time in connection with fraudulently obtained identity cards in Pakistan. Sharbat Gula was 12 when photographer Steve McCurry captured his iconic image of her living in a refugee camp for Afghan nationals in Peshawar, Pakistan. The image appeared on the cover of National Geographic magazine. This week, Pakistani media revealed that a woman believed to be her and two men said to be her sons allegedly obtained national identity cards using forged documents. An official in Pakistan's National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) confirmed the account to CNN, saying the woman -- identified as Sharbat Bibi -- claimed to have been born in Peshawar. The official spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity. The cards have since been canceled and four NADRA officials have been suspended in connection with the investigation, Pakistan's Dawn newspaper reported, citing an anonymous agency source. Such documents are off limits for Afghan nationals living in the country, the newspaper said. It's unclear if Sharbat Gula remains in Peshawar or has gone elsewhere. Some 1.5 million registered refugees from Afghanistan are living in Pakistan, according to the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. More than 3.8 million have returned to Afghanistan, according to the agency. Pressure has been mounting in Pakistan for the remaining refugees to return home, the New York Times reported this week.","""Afghan Girl"" from 1985 National Geographic cover resurfaces in documents probe .

"(CNN)Father Theodore M. Hesburgh, who led the University of Notre Dame to national academic prominence and became an influential figure in both the spiritual and political worlds, has died. He was 97. Hesburgh died Thursday. His death was confirmed by a posting on the university's website. ""We mourn today a great man and faithful priest who transformed the University of Notre Dame and touched the lives of many,"" said the Rev. John I. Jenkins, Notre Dame's current president, in a statement. ""With his leadership, charisma and vision, he turned a relatively small Catholic college known for football into one of the nation's great institutions for higher learning. In his historic service to the nation, the Church and the world, he was a steadfast champion for human rights, the cause of peace and care for the poor."" Over the course of a career that spanned more than seven decades -- 35 of them as president of Notre Dame -- Hesburgh ended up at the highest levels of both church and state. He marched with civil rights leaders. He was instrumental in giving influence to the laity at Catholic universities. He was a Vatican representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency. He was an adviser to presidents, serving on commissions concerning civil rights, immigration and military clemency issues. (And, incidentally, angering Richard Nixon over a report about racial discrimination, which prompted Hesburgh's resignation.) In 1962, he made the cover of Time magazine -- back when that was one of mainstream America's most powerful indicators of influence -- for a story about Catholic intellectuals. He was even one reason that the former Eppie Lederer ended up as advice columnist Ann Landers. As she told the story, when she applied for the position, she was given a handful of letters to answer as a test. For help on some topics she called her friends, including Supreme Court justice William O. Douglas and Hesburgh. Needless to say, she got the job. Hesburgh, a close friend, remained one of the column's go-to experts. But Hesburgh's primary focus was always the school he loved and first attended when he was 16. At the time -- the mid-1930s -- the college in South Bend, Indiana, was known for its football team, its seminary and little else. Hesburgh, a native of Syracuse, New York, graduated from a university in Rome, Italy, and was ordained in 1943. He wanted to become a military chaplain but ended up pursuing a doctorate at Washington's Catholic University. He returned to Notre Dame after the war and became head of its Theology Department, rising in its administration. He made his passions clear even before he became president, clashing with football coach Frank Leahy. When he took over the university in 1952, his goal was to create a ""Catholic Princeton."" ""The Catholic university should be a place where all the great questions are asked, where an exciting conversation is continually in progress, where the mind constantly grows as the values and powers of intelligence and wisdom are cherished and exercised in full freedom,"" he once wrote. People we've lost in 2015 . He used Notre Dame's athletic fame for bigger ends. The number of students doubled during his tenure. A library now named for him opened in 1963. Its famous mural, visible from Notre Dame's football stadium, is referred to as ""Touchdown Jesus."" And when he started at Notre Dame, its endowment was $9 million. Today it stands at close to $10 billion, the 12th-largest in the country. ""The great challenge ... at Notre Dame was to create the greatest Catholic university of all time. And I think we achieved that,"" he told Maureen McFadden of South Bend TV station WNDU, a CNN affiliate. There was criticism, of course. He traveled so much he became the subject of a campus joke: God is everywhere, Hesburgh is everywhere but Notre Dame. He disliked the Vietnam-era campus protests and threatened to expel students who were too disruptive. He sometimes butted heads with Catholic leaders. But he was, usually, beloved -- not least by the Notre Dame community. He was known for his availability to students and liked to chat with them. Perhaps his greatest influence ""was on the lives of generations of Notre Dame students, whom he taught, counseled and befriended,"" said Jenkins, the Notre Dame president, in his statement. He was amply honored during his long life. He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Congressional Gold Medal and more than 100 honorary degrees. For all his influence, Hesburgh never saw himself as high and mighty. His calling was service, and that alone was enough. ""I never wanted to be anything but a priest, which is in itself a great and unearned grace,"" he said. ""I hope to live and die a priest, nothing more, but nothing less either.""","Father Theodore Hesburgh was leader of Notre Dame for 35 years .

"(CNN)About an hour and a half before Odin Lloyd was shot to death, the suspect in his killing, Aaron Hernandez, was captured on video dancing at a gas station south of Boston. The former New England Patriots player has pleaded not guilty in the death of Lloyd, 27. The victim was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. In security surveillance video shown in court Thursday, Hernandez pulls up at a gas station just after 2 a.m. on June 17, 2013. He gets out, and so does Carlos Ortiz, who has also pleaded not guilty in the killing and is being tried separately. Prosecutors say Ernest Wallace, who is charged with being an accessory after the fact, was also in the car. Ortiz has a white towel around his neck. Prosecutors have said a white towel was later found at the crime scene. In the video surveillance, Ortiz and Hernandez appear off balance. At one point, the Hernandez fumbles with the pump's hose, then moves in front of his headlights, swaying and moving his arms over his head. Hernandez walks into the gas station, buys some gum and cigars from a clerk, then he and Ortiz leave at 2:12 a.m. About 20 minutes later, Lloyd gets into the car after it pulls up outside his home in the Dorcester section of Boston. Prosecutors say Lloyd was shot dead in an industrial park by 3:30 a.m. Two witnesses have testified hearing up to eight loud bangs. Shortly after, the same car pulled up into Hernandez's driveway with the three men. Earlier that night, Hernandez had dinner with his fiancee and two other couples at a bar in Providence, Rhode Island , according to testimony from Kelly Rose Belanger, the manager of the bar. Along with shrimp, crab cakes and chicken wings, the group had 11 cognacs, 10 sex on the beach drinks and beer. Belanger said Hernandez and another man left their group more than once to smoke marijuana outside. When customers complained about the smell of marijuana wafting inside the bar, Belanger asked Hernandez to stop smoking. He did. Hernandez picked up the tab for the group, paying $243 plus a $30 tip, according to Belanger. Investigators have said he then drove home and left with Ortiz and Wallace, before eventually picking up Lloyd. Lloyd's younger sister, Shaquilla Thibou, is expected to take the stand Friday. Prosecutors have said she saw her brother get into a car outside her home about an hour before he was killed. The judge has said Lloyd's sister is allowed to say she received four texts from her brother minutes before he was killed, but she won't be allowed to discuss what they said. In pretrial hearings, prosecutors have said Lloyd's final text read ""nfl ... just so u know.""","On that fateful night, Aaron Hernandez also had dinner with friends at a bar in Rhode Island .

"Egypt is aflame again. After seven weeks of warning of an imminent clampdown against sit-ins in support of deposed President Mohammed Morsy, the unelected and military-backed government is besieging civilian crowds to allegedly  ""restore democracy."" Emotions are running high on both sides. Dialogue and negotiations are seen as weaknesses. Military might and forceful clearing of Egypt's public squares will not solve the country's deep political problems. The solution is with Morsy. For the large numbers of Egyptians who protested in the heat while starving during the Ramadan month of fasting, Morsy remains the legitimate president of Egypt. And the violent and deadly clashes between security forces and protesters in Cairo will continue and many more lives will be lost unless we recognize and address this basic grievance. Opinion: Al Qaeda's leader's 'I told you so' on Egypt . The protesters are being led by the Muslim Brotherhood. They will not abandon mass street protests, their ""comfort zone"" as they have said. Thousands have been injured in the past two months and almost 200 people killed. Egypt's economy will continue to tank, and political instability will haunt this ancient land.  So what to do? The clue came from Morsy's son Osama Morsy when he was interviewed by CNN recently. Osama has rallied his father's supporters through public speeches. He knows the mood at the Rabaa El-Adawiyah rally and elsewhere in Egypt. He confirmed the standard views of the Muslim Brotherhood and others who oppose the recent military coup. But then he hinted at something: ""Dad, you are the legitimate leader; you are the elected leader and elected president. We back any decision you take, even if you decided to leave the office."" This might seem odd to outside observers and anti-Morsy Egyptians, but to the Muslim Brotherhood, the country's most-organized political force, Morsy is still the president of Egypt. They still believe Morsy is in office, and unless he resigns, the protesters will not waver in their support for him. Security forces opening fire on the protesters or the military clearing the various public squares across Egypt only makes martyrs of the Muslim Brotherhood. The only way out of this impasse is for Morsy to resign from office to save Egypt from further instability and loss of life. Opinion: How to rescue the Arab Spring . If Morsy were to officially resign, the Brotherhood would no longer need to rally around an individual, one of their own, who has been humiliated and mistreated. Morsy's resignation also provides the Muslim Brotherhood with a face-saving exit from its entrenched position of ""Morsy is to be reinstated"" during their protests. If Morsy were willing to leave office, it would also illustrate to Egyptians his desire to prevent further loss of life, return Egypt to civility, end the country's national disunity and allow the Brotherhood to return to the political process through elections rather than disruptive protests. If the past five Egyptian elections are a guide, then the Muslim Brotherhood will most likely dominate future parliamentary contests. By resigning, Morsy would strengthen the Muslim Brotherhood.  Ending the emerging culture of street violence would help to discredit the military's claim that the Muslim Brotherhood is turning violent and therefore should be banned, a move that would spell disaster for Islamist political activists and fuel radicalism in the country. In sum, the parallel universe in which the Muslim Brotherhood's leadership and supporters exist needs to be recognized.  Catherine Ashton, foreign policy chief of the European Union, has sought to be of help to Egypt, but she has not offered much leadership or vision. Egyptians do not need more news conferences and hurrying through meetings to catch a flight (as Ashton did). Cooler heads within the Muslim Brotherhood must prevail in persuading Morsy to resign. Ashton and others can be helpful in negotiating their access to Morsy. Why the bloodshed in Cairo? Egyptian politics will not evolve from mass protests. Yes, Morsy deserved more time in office to rectify his errors. And yes, the coup was a tragic error. And yes, Egypt's political opposition is a shambles, the local media deeply biased, the judiciary corrupt and the military politicized. The Muslim Brotherhood's task is not to uphold Morsy but to renew and reform Egypt's politics and economy by learning from Turkey's success. To do that, Morsy can help Egypt and the Muslim Brotherhood move forward by submitting his official resignation urgently. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter.

"(CNN)In the midst of the color debate, there's one thing the Internet does seem to agree upon. That dress is not cute. Whether folks were team white and gold or team blue and black, the common consensus across social media seemed to be that it is far from the height of fashion. Wired has attempted to explain the science behind the debate that has split us all. The battle, it says, ""is about more than just social media -- it's about primal biology and the way human eyes and brains have evolved to see color in a sunlit world."" ""Light enters the eye through the lens -- different wavelengths corresponding to different colors,"" writes Wired's Adam Rogers. ""The light hits the retina in the back of the eye where pigments fire up neural connections to the visual cortex, the part of the brain that processes those signals into an image."" Usually this process works fine, Rogers writes, but the image of this particular dress is ""some kind of perceptual boundary."" ""What's happening here is your visual system is looking at this thing, and you're trying to discount the chromatic bias of the daylight axis,"" Bevil Conway, a neuroscientist who studies color and vision at Wellesley College, told Wired. ""So people either discount the blue side, in which case they end up seeing white and gold, or discount the gold side, in which case they end up with blue and black."" For the record, Conway sees blue and black when he looks at the dress. According to Mashable, the frock can be purchased for $77 from the British site Roman Originals.

"(CNN)Prominent Bangladeshi-American blogger Avijit Roy began one of his final articles by writing that January's Charlie Hebdo massacre in France was ""a tragic atrocity committed by soldiers of the so-called religion of peace."" He recalled the case of another secular blogger, Ahmed Rajib Haider, who was hacked to death outside his home in Bangladesh in February 2013 by assailants with machetes. ""The virus of faith was the weapon that made these atrocities possible,"" Roy wrote in the article, which is to be published in Free Inquiry magazine in April. On Thursday night, the engineer and writer known for speaking out for secular freedom died after being attacked by machete-wielding assailants in the Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka, a local police official said. Roy, the founder of the website Mukto-Mona, and his wife were assaulted as they walked back from a speaking engagement, said Krishna Pada Roy, a deputy commissioner with the Dhaka police. Police were investigating a ""local hard-line religious group"" that praised the killing online, the BBC reported. Ajay Roy, Avijit's father, filed a case of murder with the Shahbagh police on Friday without naming suspects. The father, a retired professor at Dhaka University, later told reporters his son was killed by extremist and communal groups backed by Jamaat-e-Islami, the main Islamist political party in the country.  Avijit Roy had received death threats several times for posting his views on blog, his father said. Jamaat-e-Islami, however, protested Ajay Roy's statement and demanded punishment of the killers. Shahbagh police officer-in-charge Sirajul Islam said, ""The nature of the attack suggests a fanatic group might have been behind the murder."" Images published Friday on the blog of another prominent writer from Bangladesh show Roy, surrounded by onlookers, lying face down in a pool of blood. ""Bangladesh has become a safe haven for Islamists where they can do whatever they like,"" Taslima Nasreen, who had to leave Bangladesh after receiving death threats from extremists, wrote in her blog. ""They can kill people with no qualms whatsoever. Avijit Roy has been killed the way other free-thinking writers were killed in Bangladesh. No free thinker is safe in Bangladesh."" Roy died at a nearby hospital, the police official said. His wife suffered injuries of her own, including a severed finger. The attackers carried knives and machetes. A witness said an assailant pulled out ""a big knife"" and struck Roy from behind in the head and shoulders. Roy's wife, Rafida Ahmed Bonna,  also was hacked on the shoulders. ""I shouted for help from the people but nobody came to save him,"" the witness told CNN. ""No one came."" Last year, an Islamist activist said that Roy ""will be murdered when he comes back"" to Bangladesh, the author wrote in the Free Inquiry article. Roy reported such threats on his life, according to people who knew him. Despite threats, the writer regularly returned to Bangladesh for the February book fairs, said Michael De Dora, a friend of Roy's. ""Avijit was very idealistic,"" he said. ""His understanding was that he wouldn't be killed, that if anyone ever tried to attack him or hated him, that they could just kind of have a chat and he would convince them ... that they could at least have a dialogue."" De Dora said Roy, who was an American citizen, reported last year's threat to the FBI, but the author was skeptical of alerting Bangladeshi authorities. ""For him, even if he was getting threats that he thought were serious, to not be able to go back to his home country and meet with activists and other bloggers and writers would be kind of horrible thought for him,"" De Dora said. As in France after Islamic extremists murdered 12 people at the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris, Roy's killing has generated public outcry and demonstrations in Bangladesh. ""Dhaka University is a cradle of exercising free thoughts and democracy,"" Dhaka University Teachers Association (DUTA) said, according to the national news agency of Bangladesh, BSS. ""For these reasons, the communal extremists chose the university campus to launch attacks on persons of progressive conscience."" In the Free Inquiry article, Roy wrote compared religious extremism to ""a highly contagious virus."" When his book, ""The Virus of Faith,"" was released at a book fair last year, he wrote that the publication ""hit the cranial nerve of Islamic fundamentalists,"" who started threatening his life. ""The death threats started flowing to my e-mail inbox on a regular basis,"" Roy wrote. ""A well-known extremist ... openly issued death threats to me through through his numerous Facebook statuses."" In one widely-circulated post, Roy quotes the extremist as writing, ""Avijit Roy lives in America and so, it is not possible to kill him right now. But he will be murdered when he comes back."" The Charlie Hebdo massacre, the threats on his life, the removal of his books from a Bangladesh online bookstore after pressure from extremists prove that ""the virus of faith is dangerously real,"" Roy wrote. Roy and his wife were attacked on the Dhaka University campus as they were leaving a book fair where Roy had spoken. Based out of the Atlanta area, Roy was a ""prominent defender of the free thought movement (and) advocate of atheism, science and metaphysical naturalism,"" according to his website. He authored seven books and his writings were also featured in numerous magazines and journals. The couple has a daughter, Trisha Ahmed, a student at Johns Hopkins University, De Dora said. Roy's outspokenness, especially on matters of religion, made him a target in Bangladesh, where nearly 90% of people are Muslim and 10% are Hindu, according to the U.S. government. A September 2013 blog post by Roy was headlined, ""Happy Blasphemy Day, Happy Birthday 'Mukto Mona.'"" Roy wrote that the day is ""dedicated to those who are systematically being persecuted, harassed, or killed for their simple expression of Freethought (more precisely, for their 'blasphemous' views towards religion)."" Countries such as Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Bangladesh have ""retained social ideas that are reminiscent of the medieval age,"" when blasphemy laws were ""equated with sin,"" the author wrote. In Bangladesh, bloggers were jailed ""on the sole basis that they were openly atheist,"" he wrote. In Pakistan, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom reported at least 203 incidents of violence ""in the name of religion,"" resulting in more than 700 deaths in an 18-month period. In Saudi Arabia, he wrote, a 19-year-old gang-rape victim was sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in jail for ""indecency"" and speaking to the press. ""The nonbelievers in these Islamic countries face the most severe treatment at the hands of both mullahs and the state,"" Roy wrote. De Dora, director of the Amherst, New York-based Center for Inquiry's office of public policy, called the author's death ""a great loss."" ""Avijit was brilliant, yes, and a devoted advocate of free expression and secularism, but also just a very good person,"" he said in a statement. ""Avijit was an inspiration to countless other freethinkers, in Bangladesh and around the world, and he was an inspiration to me."" Bangladeshi Health and Family Welfare Minister Mohammad Nasim condemned the killing and called for the ""expeditious nabbing of the killers and their exemplary punishment,"" the BSS news agency reported. Information Minister Hasanul Haq Inu ""expressed deep sorrow and sympathy at the untimely death"" on the same news site. Jadabeswar Bhattacharjee, a contributor to Mukto-Mona, posted Friday that Roy had been killed by ""some brain-dead Islamist bigots."" ""I have no word to condemn this heinous crime perpetuated by these Islamist cowards,"" he wrote. ""When such Islamist cowards failed in intellectual discourse with Avijit and when they found that their dogma has been proved hollow by Avijit, they settled the score by murdering him."" Bob Churchill, a spokesman for the London-based International Humanist and Ethical Union, said the ""loss is keenly felt by freethinkers and humanists in South Asia and around the world"" and called Roy ""a colleague in humanism and a friend to all who respect human rights, freedom, and the light of reason."" The IHEU said in a statement that an Islamist activist ""well-known"" to authorities early last year threatened Roy and ""repeatedly and openly talked about wanting to see secular and freethought writers dead."" ""Those under threat have complained that authorities have ignored his threats and incitement, despite his credible links to Islamist extremists and similar murders taking place,"" the statement said. There was no immediate response to the claim from authorities in Bangladesh. CNN's Lonzo Cook, Greg Botelho, Farid Ahmed and John Couwels contributed to this report.","Victim's father says extremists backed by Bangladesh's main Islamist party killed his son .

"(CNN)Fifty years ago, on March 2, 1965, a movie based on a successful Rogers and Hammerstein Broadway musical premiered in New York. Julie Andrews starred as Maria von Trapp, a real-life ex-nun who married an Austrian naval officer after she became governess to his children. The film was, of course, ""The Sound of Music,"" the biggest grossing musical of all time, if receipts are adjusted for inflation. Its core family values, hummable tunes and stunning scenery turned it into a worldwide success. It also ensured that Salzburg, with two dozen locations featured in the film, would never be the same again. The first tourists asking about the film settings started arriving in 1966 and were faced by bemused locals. Most Austrians still haven't seen ""The Sound of Music"" and don't understand what the fuss is about. The film ran only for a very short period in the country and was subsequently dropped. Although many reasons are put forward for its disappearance, the instances of Nazi complicity depicted in the film were certainly too much to bear for the Austria of the 1960s, which was forging a new, democratic future for itself. One company, however, knew all about the locations and was happy to oblige. Kleinbusse am Mirabellplatz had provided six Volkswagen vans for director Bob Wise to transport his 250 stars and staff around for three months during the shooting. The company morphed into today's Panorama Tours, doing two four-hour ""Sound of Music"" tours a day, every day, all year. Even on a cold January morning, when I join, there are still 53 people in the tour. Most are under 35, about half are American, but the rest come from all over the world: Cyprus, Italy, India, Japan. The tour picks us up from Mirabell Gardens where most of the ""Do-Re-Mi"" song was filmed, and proceeds to Leopoldskron Palace where the lake scenes were shot. The palace's Grand Ballroom was too narrow to film in, so it was meticulously copied and recreated in the 20th Century Fox studios in Los Angeles for the waltz scenes. Then we're off to the gazebo, used for ""Sixteen Going on Seventeen."" It was originally sited outside Leopoldskron Palace but it attracted too many tourists for the business convention center housed there, so in 1989 it was moved to Hellbrunn Palace Gardens. There are photo ops at the bottom of Nonnberg Abbey where Maria von Trapp was a novice nun, and outside Frohnburg Castle, which served as the exterior of the von Trapp villa. The tree-lined avenue leading to the castle is where the von Trapp children dangled from branches, to the horror of their father. The final part of the tour takes in the lakes of Salzkammergut that feature in aerial shots: Lake Fuschl, Lake Wolfgang and Mondsee, in whose village church Maria's marriage ceremony was filmed. Apart from the Mirabelle Gardens, which are in the new town across the Salzach river, the pedestrianized Old Town provides the backdrop for all other scenes. Amazingly, the fruit market where Maria tries to juggle two balls is still in the same spot. The Mozart footbridge over the Salzach and the steps down from the Modern Art Museum looking down on the town were used to film the children singing ""Do-Re-Mi."" Fans will also recognize Residenzplatz as the square draped with Nazi flags -- a scene director Bob Wise fought hard to shoot in the open. The Salzburg Festival does indeed take place in the same theater where the von Trapp family win first prize at the end of the film, while St. Peter's Cemetery nearby was used as a model for the scene immediately afterward, where the family hides from the Nazis. It's possible to walk inside the Nonnberg convent. The two dozen Benedictine nuns living there cannot be seen, although they can occasionally be heard singing Vespers behind a grille around 5 p.m. Two new attractions have been added to the ""Sound of Music"" phenomenon since the film's last big anniversary 40 years ago. The original von Trapp villa in the suburb of Aigen is now a full-fledged hotel. The family lived there before they fled to America in 1938. Afterward, it became the main residence of Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS, who built the high wall that surrounds it today. After the war, the von Trapp family sold it to a Catholic monastic order. Recently, the last remaining members retreated to a new building nearby and rented the villa to Chris Unterkofler and Marianne Dorfer, the couple who run the hotel today. They explain to me that part of the attraction is to learn about the real von Trapps. The public spaces are full of family photographs, pictures of Maria's wedding and old publicity shots. The two Chinese benches in the hall belonged to Captain von Trapp who bought them in Beijing during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900. A model ship he constructed is on display in the breakfast room. Plus, it's possible to commute to the center of Salzburg, catching the local tram at the end of the garden, from the same stop where the family fled to Italy in 1938. No, they didn't climb over the mountains like in the film; that would have taken them to Germany, not Switzerland. Finally, for anyone who's watched ""The Sound of Music"" on the big screen, bought the DVD and seen the play, there's a new medium to tick off. The Marionettentheater in Salzburg now offers a puppet version of the musical. Managing director Barbara Heuberger is proud of her creation. Although the show has been shortened to one hour and forty minutes, no expense has been spared with its 50-plus puppets that include five Marias, 21 children, seven Captains and two Baronesses. The puppet show can be seen on odd dates all year round, but it's regularly performed to sell-out audiences three times a week in July and August. The show will almost certainly come to those with enough patience, Frau Neuberger tells me. The puppets keep touring and have had audiences singing along from Abu Dhabi to Uganda. Whatever anyone thinks about ""The Sound of Music,"" it's hard to deny that it's one of the few cinematic experiences that continues to offer cheers in a fractious world. For visitors to Austria, the hills are still very much alive with it. Salzburg is 2 hours and 22 minutes by train from Vienna ($50 per person one way, oebb.at). Salzburg Tourism has an office inside the main train station and also at Mozartplatz 5.They can suggest guides for a city walking tour. Julie Andrews stayed at Hotel Osterrechischer Hof, now Hotel Sacher (Schwarzstrasse 5-7; +43 662 889 770), which has doubles from $485. The hotel won't divulge which room she stayed in, but if they get a specific request, will try to accommodate you there. Hotel Bristol Salzburg (Makartplatz 4; +43 662 873 557) has doubles from $820. This is where Christopher Plummer stayed and played the piano that can still be seen in the bar today. The Trapp Villa (Traunstrasse 34, Aigen; +43 662 630 860) is a 15-minute, $15 taxi ride from the center of Salzburg, or four stops on the local tram. A family suite for four starts from $200 in low season. Private tours are possible via prior reservation. The Sound of Music Panorama Tour (+43 662 883 211-0) starts from $40 per person in low season.

"London (CNN)Following the brutal killing of James Foley in August 2014, the masked face of ""Jihadi John"" first gained prominence across our TV screens, newspapers, and social media feeds. Since then, as a direct consequence of the copious media attention dedicated to Jihadi John, the image of the masked figure has become ubiquitous and inescapable, allowing for a potent propaganda tool for ISIS, also known as Islamic State. He was on Thursday unmasked as Mohammed Emwazi, a Kuwaiti-born 27-year-old from west London, first in the Washington Post and later confirmed by two U.S. officials and two U.S. congressional sources briefed on the matter. It is important to understand what the desired effect of the ""Jihadi John"" brand is -- a marketing tool that uses fear to promote a hateful ideology. Therefore, although the media has an obligation to report on issues around the world, as consumers of information, we must ensure we don't allow ISIS propaganda to achieve its desired effect. What likely began as a crude anonymizing tool to help partially conceal the identity of the killer, has now become a deliberate tool to help further the cause of ISIS's state-building exercise. This is a tool that is specifically targeted at the West, and particularly the UK, seeking to instil fear by forcing us to ask questions which play to our security concerns. It is difficult for me to imagine how a young man with a London accent would not only be able to kill innocent individuals, but to do so in the brutal manner in which he has. How is it that a man, who could have quite easily been walking among us every day, was able to kill a generous kind-hearted man such as Alan Henning in cold blood? Now that the identity of ""Jihadi John"" is known to be Emwazi, it is vitally important that we ensure that we don't allow the brand to achieve its objective -- to instil fear within Western audiences, advancing ISIS propaganda, and dulling civil society's willingness to challenge extremism out of fear. One way in which we can do this is to counter the desired dehumanized and threatening perception of Emwazi, and acknowledge why this plays into the hands of Jihadists. We must also begin to challenge the root cause of ISIS violence -- the Salafi-jihadi ideology which underpins it, and the entire Islamist spectrum which legitimizes this murderous fringe. How can it be that an affluent west London Kuwaiti has so much in common with three teenage girls from Bethnal Green? The reason both of these seemingly disparate groups of have traveled to either commit atrocities, or play a role in ISIS's state-building exercise, is that they all shared the ideology that underpins the actions of jihadist groups. It is no surprise that the Emwazi is from an affluent family. Nor is it shocking to hear that he is well educated. Over the last 20 years, there have been countless cases of members of the Salafi jihadist movement who have been affluent, educated or both. Osama Bin Laden was university educated and his family were billionaires. Ayman al-Zawahiri, the current head of the al Qaeda, was a surgeon who had a degree in medicine from the University of Cairo. This characteristic isn't only shared by top-ranking officials within jihadist organizations, but is common amongst those leaving from the UK who seek to fulfil lesser roles within the new so-called ""Islamic State."" The three girls from Bethnal Green Academy, Amira Abase, Shamima Begum and Kadiza Sultana, were grade-A students set for high academic achievement, according to their family and peers. Also worth understanding and unpicking is London's status as a net exporter of extremism. Last week the focus was east London, where the three teenagers from Bethnal Green were tempted by ISIS, and west London now, as it emerged that Emwazi had lived in Ladbroke Grove. It seems that ""Londonistan,"" as the French government affectionately called our capital in the 1990s, has become a microcosm of the UK experience with extremism, and has fallen foul of failed attempts to tackle this. By focusing only on the role of law enforcement officials, and by exclusively dealing with extremism once it has become a terrorist act, we are consistently one step behind, and the terrorist intention achieves almost as much as the terrorist act as regards public opinion anyway. Instead we need a civil society response that challenges extremism of all kinds as a social ill, comparable to racism or homophobia. London leading the UK in this shift cannot come soon enough. Now that the identity of ""Jihadi John"" is known, it is more important than ever to ensure we don't simply destroy the brand, but also dismantle the marketing strategy, and dispute the ideology.","Haras Rafiq: Desired effect of ""Jihadi John"" brand is -- a marketing tool that uses fear to promote a hateful ideology .

"Donetsk, Ukraine (CNN)A dispute over natural gas supply flared Friday between Russia and Ukraine, even as a ceasefire between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine appeared to be taking hold. Both sides in the conflict have begun withdrawing their heavy weaponry from the front line of the conflict, in line with a peace deal agreed to in Minsk, Belarus, two weeks ago. There has also been a reduction in the fighting between the two sides, although some artillery fire can still be heard. But the ceasefire remains fragile. A spokesman for Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko cited him as saying on Twitter: ""We starting withdrawing only some of the heavy weaponry. Ukrainian military are ready to return the equipment to the front line any time."" The leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Alexander Zacharchenko, said separatist forces there had withdrawn 90% of their heavy weapons. But he also warned that they reserved the right to return the weapons to the front line if authorities in Kiev did not keep their end of the bargain. A CNN team on the ground saw a small convoy of artillery, flying the yellow-and-blue flag of Ukraine, heading south out of the conflict zone Thursday. The separatists began the withdrawal of heavy weapons a couple of days earlier. Under the terms of the Minsk agreement, the two sides have until Monday to complete the withdrawal and create a buffer zone of at least 50 kilometers (31 miles) for heavy weapons. The Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe is tasked with monitoring the ceasefire and the withdrawal. Ukraine's National Defense and Security Council said Friday that three Ukrainian troops had been killed and seven injured in the past 24 hours in continued clashes. Meanwhile, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak warned that Russian energy giant Gazprom could cut the supply of natural gas to its neighbor in the coming days if payment is not received. Russia's Tass state news agency said that Gazprom confirmed receiving $15 million Friday in prepayment from Ukraine. But that is enough to pay for only a day's supply of natural gas, the news agency said. A meeting between the European Union, Russia and Ukraine is due to take place in Brussels, Belgium, on Monday to discuss gas supply to Ukraine. Russia has used gas as a weapon before, cutting off supplies to Ukraine three times in the past decade. A new dispute could affect the rest of Europe. About a third of the European Union's natural gas comes from Russia, and 15% flows through Ukraine. However, now that the worst of winter is over, the threat of a halt in the supply of gas is less alarming than it was for Ukraine and for the rest of Europe. In any case, Kiev has reserve gas supplies that could be used if the supply from Russia were stopped. Europe also has the option of reverse supply -- sending gas back through pipelines into Ukraine. The latest disagreement comes against the backdrop of an EU investigation into Gazprom, which is due to report soon. Europe has accused Gazprom of using its dominant position to manipulate prices and hinder the free flow of gas across the continent. The developing situation in eastern Ukraine was the focus of an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting in New York on Friday. The chief monitor for the OSCE mission to Ukraine, Ertugrul Apakan, reported some progress in implementing the Minsk agreement as he briefed the council, but said much remained to be done. ""For the past days, combat operations have been significantly reduced across the conflict zone, although some violence has still occurred around Donetsk airport, as well as close to the town of Mariupol,"" he said. ""As to the withdrawal of heavy weapons, yesterday our monitors began observing the movement of heavy weapons away from the line of contact on several instances."" However, the OSCE needs more information in order to monitor their withdrawal effectively, he said, including what heavy weapons each side has, where they are now and where they will be taken. There are currently 451 civilian monitors in Ukraine, he said, of whom more than 300 are in the contested Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The mission will need more technological resources, such as drones, in order to cover a huge area of operations extending about 50,000 square kilometers (19,300 square miles), including large stretches of the Russia-Ukraine border, he said. More hubs may also have to be set up for OSCE patrols. Ertugrul also highlighted the plight of more than 1 million people forced from their homes within Ukraine, ""some of them living in desperate circumstances."" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, speaking Friday at his ministry's Diplomatic Academy, said: ""Impartial observers, including the Organization for Co-operation and Security in Europe, have registered a significant reduction in the exchange of fire, so the ceasefire is nonetheless yielding a result."" But he stressed that although some progress has been seen in the withdrawal of heavy weapons, ""it is important to consolidate it."" He also warned that Ukraine must keep its nonaligned status ""in order to keep the stability in Europe."" Russia is unhappy about what it sees as NATO's expansion toward its western border. Ukraine is not a NATO member, but Baltic nations bordering Russia belong to the alliance and Georgia also hopes to join. Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of arming and training the separatists, as well as sending Russian troops over the border to fight with them. Russia denies the claims. CNN's Diana Magnay reported from Donetsk, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported from London. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen and journalist Victoria Butenko contributed from Kiev. CNN's Radina Gigova, Nana Karikari-apau and Ivana Kottasova also contributed.","OSCE mission chief in Ukraine cites reduction in combat, signs of heavy weapons withdrawal .

"Tokyo (CNN)Japanese Crown Prince Naruhito celebrated his 55th birthday by weighing in on the current controversies swirling around Japan's wartime past. At a news conference on February 23rd, Naruhito stated, ""I myself did not experience the war... but I think that it is important today, when memories of the war are fading, to look back humbly on the past and correctly pass on the tragic experiences and history Japan pursued from the generation which experienced the war to those without direct knowledge."" His remarks might seem unobjectionable, but in the oblique and abstract lexicon of the Imperial Household Agency, he has fired shots across the bow of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his fellow revisionists. The Imperial Household almost never strays into political affairs due to constitutional constraints, but Emperor Akihito has on occasion stretched his tether to its limits, and when he has done so it has always been to repudiate right-wingers who prefer to think they are acting in his name. It appears that his son is letting it be known that the Imperial Household remains steadfast on the issue of war responsibility, following up his father's similar rebuke at the beginning of January. Prince Naruhito's remarks were in response to a question regarding the 70th anniversary of the end of WWII in August this year, and comes amid feverish speculation about what Abe intends to include and exclude from his pending statement on that occasion. So when the prince talks about the need for humility and correctness in assessing wartime Japan, and passing on the lessons of that tragedy to future generations, many Japanese understand his ineffable message calling on Abe to tread carefully. It is for us pundits to say what he can't: ""Humbly"" means not glorifying this inglorious past, while ""correctly"" means not ignoring all the evidence of Japanese aggression and war crimes. Future generations, in his view, deserve to understand all that went wrong instead of the chest-thumping, valorizing revisionist history favored by the reactionaries who hold political power in Japan. Given Abe's woeful track record on history, this pointed reminder is useful and also demonstrates that Naruhito is ready to take on a bigger role when it is time to do so, and that he plans to continue Emperor Akihito's reconciliation activism. Recently, tabloid conservatives questioned whether he was up to the job so this may be a riposte to his critics. The problem about interpreting the utterances of Japan's royals is that bureaucrats vet everything they say, and the wording of statements is intentionally ambiguous to provide plausible deniability. The deliberately veiled vagueness, however, cannot disguise the symbolism of the royals expressing their unease about wartime history two months in a row precisely at a time when Abe is under intensified scrutiny. This unprecedented double rebuke is not a coincidence. Ironically, they both obliquely censure military aggression during the reign of Emperor Hirohito, Naruhito's grandfather, while Abe frequently invokes his own grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, as an inspiration. This is jarring given that Kishi was a ""Class A"" war crimes suspect -- although never indicted or even tried -- for his record of mobilizing forced labor in Manchuria and prominent role as Minister of Munitions from 1941-45. Abe recently appointed a committee of advisers to provide input on his 70th anniversary statement. Their views won't really matter, but it is politically useful that Abe is at least going through the motions of asking the opinion of other eminent people even though none of them is remotely likely to challenge his revisionist views. The Japanese media is riveted by Abe's vacillating remarks regarding the content of the forthcoming statement because the implications are potentially explosive for regional relations. Beijing and Seoul will carefully scrutinize his words for any sign of backsliding on war responsibility and expressions of remorse. Washington has also made it clear that Abe will undermine U.S. relations if he doesn't come clean on war guilt. Abe thus faces tremendous international pressure to swallow his deeply felt views on the wartime issue, but domestic opinion is more divided. Under Abe there has been a resurgence of jingoistic nationalism -- rightwing extremists have become emboldened, attacking the liberal press, threatening journalists and academics, and engaging in hate speech targeting Japan's ethnic Korean minority. They have done so with virtual impunity. Abe's core constituencies are eager to see him redeem the unredeemable and members of reactionary groups such as Nippon Kaigi (dubbed Japan's Tea Party) and the Association of Shinto Shrines dominate his cabinet, and share his views on history and shaking off the shackles of the past. In defiance of majority public opinion, they also support his security agenda of boosting defense cooperation with the U.S. and eliminating constitutional curbs on Japan's military forces. The gathering forces of darkness apparent in Abe's Japan are troubling to the nation's friends and allies because they are incrementally eroding the foundations of liberal democracy. Against this backdrop, Japan's besieged liberals welcome the moral support given by Emperor Akihito and Crown Prince Naruhito. But will the royal reproaches matter? Since the 1995 Murayama Statement commemorating the 50th anniversary of WWII's end, all Japanese leaders have dutifully repeated then-Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama's heartfelt apology and expression of remorse. This statement has thus become a benchmark against which the Abe Statement will be judged. Murayama, 89, recently reassured South Korean leaders that Abe would uphold his statement, but doubts linger because Abe has been evasive and waffling about what he plans to say. He has said he will generally uphold the statement, but this provides room for caveats and ellipses. It is precisely his disputing of the historical details that lands Abe in hot water as he questions what the term aggression means, quibbles about the level of coercion used in recruiting comfort women and in January expressed outrage about what he deems inaccurate accounts of the comfort women in a U.S. history textbook. The Imperial Household understands that Abe risks undermining Japan's dignity and isolating it from neighbors and allies. By expressing their concerns about war memory, both royals seek to steer Japan back onto the course of reconciliation and a brighter future. In doing so they provide political cover for Abe to disappoint his jingoistic supporters and make the right call on the past.","Japan's crown prince urges subjects to ""look back humbly on the past and correctly pass on the tragic experiences and history"" of WWII .

"(CNN)Thousands more art treasures could be destroyed in Iraq and Syria, antiquities experts fear, after ISIS released a video showing militants smashing artifacts at a museum in Mosul, Iraq. ""It's tragic to see this destruction,"" William Webber, from the UK-based Art Loss Register, told CNN. ""Each time you see this you think it can't happen again, but it does. Now other Greco-Roman treasures are at risk around Mosul in Iraq, as well as other artifacts in Palmyra and Raqqa in Syria."" The video shows men taking sledgehammers to statues, and hammers and drills to the treasures. Qais Hussain Rashid, director general of Iraqi museums at the Ministry of Antiquities and Tourism, said Friday on Iraqiya TV he believed most of the artifacts shown in the ISIS video were real -- including a famed, millennia-old winged bull that's seen being defaced with a drill. ""Mosul Museum has 173 original pieces, and there were preparations to reopen the Mosul Museum before ISIS invaded the city on June 2014,"" Rashid said. He added that Mosul has more than 1,700 historical sites that are potentially at risk. An unnamed militant offers the following explanation: ""These antiquities and idols behind me were from people in past centuries and were worshiped instead of God. ""When God Almighty orders to us destroy these statues, idols and antiquities, we must do it, even if they're worth billions of dollars."" CNN has extensively reported on ISIS' destruction of some ancient and deeply meaningful sites in Iraq. Officials there have said ISIS has blown up shrines such as the tomb of Jonah. ""If you're going to eradicate someone's identity the best way is to eradicate their art,"" Webber said. ""They see this art as blasphemous because it portrays deities. In areas of Syria, ISIS is also attacking anything that's pre-Islamic or that they don't agree with in Shia areas or in Christian churches."" Most of the sculptures being destroyed were from the Assyrian period [roughly 2500 to 605BC], Webber said. Militants were pulling them over and smashing them; bigger relief pieces were being smashed with hammers. ""It's very depressing and shocking. If they have control of the whole museum they could destroy the whole lot, or sell some pieces such as coins, tablets and cylinder seals."" It's unclear from the footage how many of the pieces were originals, versus replicas. Webber said he hoped that some of the items were copies rather than the real thing, but added that at least some of those shown in the video were genuine. ""Much of the material in the museums was made out of limestone or fragile stone, so if you threw it to the floor it might look as though it was made of plaster of Paris, but really it's just fragile. It's tragic to see it."" Webber said that following vandalism at provincial museums in the wake of the first Gulf War, many antiquities were moved to Baghdad, where they were ransacked in 2003. ""It appears that they had not been moved from this museum in Mosul."" Other experts agreed that the items destroyed appeared to be genuine. ""On repeated viewing of that very grainy video, we now suspect that there (were) far more originals in the museum than I first thought,"" said Eleanor Robson, chairwoman of the British Institute for the Study of Iraq. ""Whilst there was indeed a program to relocate antiquities to safekeeping in Baghdad, it looks now as though it didn't reach that particular museum.""","Antiquities experts fear thousands more art treasures could be destroyed in Iraq and Syria after ISIS militants destroy artifacts .

"London (CNN)British former pop star Gary Glitter on Friday was sentenced to 16 years in prison for child sex abuse offenses he committed more than three decades ago. Glitter, 70, whose real name is Paul Gadd, was convicted this month of one count of attempted rape of a girl under the age of 13, one count of having sex with a girl under the age of 13 and four counts of indecent assault against girls. He was sentenced at Southwark Crown Court in London for the six offenses, committed against three victims between 1975 and 1980. There is no statute of limitations for such offenses in the UK. Glitter was known as a ""glam rocker"" in the 1970s for his flamboyant clothes and performing style. He sold 18 million records with hits such as ""I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am!),"" ""I Love You Love Me Love"" and ""Rock 'n' Roll."" Detective Chief Inspector Michael Orchard of London's Metropolitan Police praised the courage of the abuse victims in coming forward to police. ""Paul Gadd has shown himself to be a habitual sexual predator, who took advantage of the star status afforded to him by targeting young girls who trusted him and were in awe of his fame,"" Orchard said. ""His lack of remorse and defense that the victims were lying make his crimes all the more indefensible."" Glitter was the first person to be arrested under the police's Operation Yewtree, set up in 2012 in the wake of a flood of sexual abuse allegations against the late radio and TV star Jimmy Savile and others. Savile, who died in 2011 aged 84, was revealed after his death to have been one of Britain's most prolific sex offenders. British police say more than 200 victims -- between ages 5 and 75 -- have been identified. Glitter had been prosecuted previously on sex charges. In 1999, he admitted possessing child pornography and was jailed for four months. While living in Vietnam, he was convicted of sex offenses against young girls and jailed for nearly three years before being deported to England. Glitter is the latest celebrity to be accused or convicted of historic sex offenses. Last year celebrity publicist Max Clifford was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment for assaults on girls, while Australian entertainer Rolf Harris was jailed for five years for indecent assaults against four girls.","Gary Glitter is sentenced to 16 years in prison after being convicted of child sex abuse .

"Atlanta (CNN)Maybe the thieves didn't know what they were stealing. A NASCAR Sprint Cup car stolen from outside the hotel where the team was staying turned up on a rural Georgia road Saturday -- the day before the scheduled race at Atlanta Motor Speedway, but not in time for the team to qualify. The No. 44 Chevrolet was in a 26-foot trailer, which was hitched to a pickup truck that was stolen early Friday morning from the hotel in Morrow, Georgia, according to its owner, Team Xtreme Racing. The car normally travels in an 18-wheeler, but the hauler arrived at the Speedway early to escape bad weather back in Charlotte, North Carolina, the team said. The car remained behind for some minor work, said the team and driver Travis Kvapil. ""It wasn't quite ready to go to the racetrack yet,"" Kvapil told CNN on Saturday. ""The guys had to continue to do some more work on it at the shop, so they stayed back with the car and then just sent it down a day later with the truck and smaller trailer and parked it in the hotel parking lot."" The trailer with car inside arrived at the hotel Thursday night at 11 p.m. and hotel surveillance video shows the theft occurred at 5:32 a.m. Friday, the team said. ""I bet when whoever has it, opens the trailer and is going to be like 'oh snap',"" Kvapil tweeted Friday. Early Saturday, the team tweeted photos of the recovered orange and blue car, in the dark on the side of a road. The Chevrolet was found by itself, minus the stolen Ford truck and trailer, in Loganville, about 50 miles northeast of Atlanta Motor Speedway, the team wrote in a series of tweets Saturday. The truck was found later Saturday on the side of a road in Stockbridge, just north of the Speedway, Morrow Police Sgt. Larry Oglesby said. The driver's side door handle was broken and there was damage to the ignition, he said. The spare motor and extra parts that had been with the car were not found, according to Team Xtreme Racing. The man who found the race car, Philip Whitmer, says he was in disbelief when he saw it a few feet off the road. It was 2:30 a.m. and he was driving to his fiancée's house when he spotted it. ""I was like, that looks like a NASCAR (car),"" Whitmer told CNN. ""I turned around, put my headlights on it, and there it was."" Whitmer says he called police, who at first didn't believe him. In front of the car were ramps and next to it were the straps that secured the car in the trailer, he said. There were also dusty handprints above the driver's door, he said -- though it's not clear whether they were from the thieves. ""Obviously they are someone that knows the area -- that's what was going through my head,"" Whitmer said. ""It's got to be someone from around here. You don't stumble across that road."" The theft forced the team to withdraw the car from Sunday's Folds of Honor QuickTrip 500, which was going to be the first Sprint Cup start of the season for Kvapil. ""The biggest thing is, we found that racecar,"" Kvapil said. ""It's a small team and this (would have been) a big setback for us if that was missing. It was enough of a setback as it was, not being able to qualify and run the race at Atlanta Motor Speedway this weekend."" Kvapil said he is ""really thankful and happy for all the guys who worked so hard on this car. They put a lot of hours into it, and it would have been a real shame if it was gone."" By Saturday afternoon, the No. 44 car was back at the team's shop in Mooresville, North Carolina, where it will be given a thorough inspection. So far, Kvapil said, ""it looks shipshape."" Team owner John Cohen said they plan to compete in the rest of the 2015 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season. The next race is March 8 at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway. CNN's John Newsome contributed to this report.","The No. 44 car was stolen Friday from the team's hotel .

"(CNN)Two years ago, Aaron Hernandez had a $40 million contract and was a rising NFL star. Now the former New England Patriot is on trial in the killing of Odin Lloyd. Lloyd, a semipro football player, was shot multiple times on June 17, 2013. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty. Here are some of the key moments from the past week of his murder trial: . Judge Susan Garsh on Monday reversed her initial ruling to block any mention of multiple texts from Lloyd before he was slain. Lloyd's sister, Shaquilla Thibou will be able to say she received four texts from her brother just minutes before his death. The last text came at 3:23 a.m., a minute before workers in the industrial park where Lloyd's body later was found heard gunshots. Thibou had been expected to testify Friday, but that testimony was delayed as the court proceedings focused instead on exploring critical cellphone records. Thibou will not be able to talk about the nature of the texts, including this one that prosecutors say was from Lloyd: ""U saw who I'm with... Nfl... just so u know."" The judge ruled it would be too prejudicial against Hernandez. Two plant employees working the overnight shift at Needletech Products Inc., a company in the industrial park where Lloyd's body was found, reported hearing loud bangs at the time he was thought to have been fatally shot. One worker, Barbara Chan, said she was napping in her car during her lunch break between 3 and 3:30 a.m. ""I heard a loud band, maybe four or five times,"" she testified Monday, saying she thought it was fireworks. ""It was two slow ones and three fast ones,"" she added. Another plant worker, Michael Ribeiro, said he heard about six or eight loud bangs just after 3:20 a.m. ""A loud banging sound, like fireworks going off,"" Ribeiro testified. Prosecutors have presented evidence, including autopsy photos that show Lloyd was shot six times -- once in the back, once in the arm, and the rest to his torso. On Tuesday, during testimony by one of three cleaning ladies in the Hernandez household, prosecutors showed the jury video of Hernandez's fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, taking a trash bag from the house and placing it in the trunk of her sister's car. Her sister, Shaneah Jenkins, was Lloyd's girlfriend. What might Shayanna Jenkins say? In the video, Shayanna Jenkins appears to walk out the back patio door of the Hernandez home carrying a heavy, black trash bag. At one point, she puts it down and places a pile of clothes into the bag, picks it up again and goes to the garage. One of the maids, Carla Barbosa, then moves a white van out of the way to clear a path for Jenkins. Jenkins then puts the bag into the trunk of her sister's car. Prosecutors allege Jenkins may have been following instructions from Hernandez to get rid of the murder weapon from their home by putting the gun in a black trash bag and borrowing her sister's car to dispose of the bag in a trash bin. Prosecutors say that on the day after Lloyd was killed, Jenkins got a coded text message from Hernandez. Hernandez asked Jenkins to get something out of their basement, according to search warrants. ""Go ... in back of the screen in movie room when u (sic) get home an (sic) there is a box ... jus (sic) in case u were looking for it!!! Member (sic) how you ruined the big tv ... WAS JUST THINKIN bout that lol wink wink love u TTYL....K"" TTYL is shorthand for ""talk to you later."" When Jenkins returned home, she was captured on the same security system, but without the bag. Jenkins told a grand jury she threw it in a trash bin but couldn't remember where, according to prosecutors. Prosecutors suspect the still-missing murder weapon was inside. (Jenkins has been granted immunity, compelling her to testify at Hernandez's trial. She is on the prosecution's witness list. It is not known whether her testimony will help or hurt Hernandez.) When the defense team questioned Barbosa, she acknowledged she had no idea what was in the trash bag and that it could have been trash. Two other cleaning ladies, Marilia Prinholato and Grazielli Andrade Silva, both testified this week they found guns in the Hernandez home. Silva owns the company responsible for Hernandez's residence and has also cleaned other Patriots' players houses, . Silva testified she took a gun from a pair of Hernandez's pants and showed it to her co-worker. She said she put it back in the pants because she didn't want anyone to know she had seen it. Silva also testified to feeling a gun under the mattress in the basement bedroom where Ernest Wallace was staying. Wallace and Carlos Ortiz have also been charged with murder in the death of Lloyd. They have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. Prinholato said she saw a gun fall out from beneath the mattress of the same bed a month before Lloyd's killing. Surveillance video shows Hernandez pulling up to a gas station in his rented silver Nissan Altima at 2 a.m. that June 17, a little more than an hour before Lloyd's death. Wallace and Ortiz are with him. The surveillance video was shown in court this week. Hernandez and Ortiz exit the car. Ortiz is wearing a white towel, which prosecutors say is the same one found at the crime scene. Hernandez dances a few times -- once as he walks in front of his car and into the store, where he and Ortiz buy cotton candy-flavored bubble gum and a box of Black & Mild cigars. A chewed piece of gum was found stuck to a .45-caliber shelling in a trash bin at an Enterprise rental car place, a detective said. Surveillance video shows Hernandez dancing again, pumping his arms in the air as he returns to his car and walks around. The three men leave the gas station at 2:12 a.m. Twenty minutes later, at 2:32 a.m., another surveillance video shows a silver Nissan Altima pull up in front of Lloyd's house. Lloyd is waiting outside and gets in the car. CNN's Lawrence Crook contributed to this report.","Aaron Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to killing Odin Lloyd .

"Washington (CNN)Is the Democratic party over for Israel? For years, support for Israel has been one of the few reliably bipartisan issues on Capitol Hill, with members on both sides of the aisle embracing the embattled Middle East country and welcoming its leaders with open arms. But when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accepted an invitation from Republican House Speaker John Boehner to address Congress on Tuesday — when he is expected to sharply criticize White House deal-making with Iran — he alienated more than the Democrat who sits in the Oval Office. As administration officials have exchanged increasingly hostile volleys with Netanyahu, party stalwarts are warning of a Democratic exodus away from Israel. They caution that the rancor over the speech could accelerate demographic and political trends that suggest support for Israel is becoming a partisan issue, with Republicans strongly pro and Democrats less so. Already 30 House Democrats have said they will boycott the speech. And when two senior Democratic senators invited Netanyahu for a private conversation during his visit to Capitol Hill, he said no. (His office said he also turned down similar requests from Republicans because he didn't want to politicize the visit.) Senate leadership on Thursday announced that a bipartisan meeting with the Prime Minister had at last been arranged. But many in the Democratic Party say the damage done in the run-up to the speech will linger long past Tuesday. Former Rep. Henry Waxman, a California Democrat and staunch supporter of Israel who left office this year, said that because Netanyahu's speech was seen as a rebuke of the President, Democrats feel the need to step up to defend Obama. ""A lot of Democrats feel that they have to stick with their president and not take this kind of bipartisan approach, because they're now looking at it as something that is a partisan attack,"" he said. And one of the Democrats sitting out Netanyahu's speech, Tennessee Rep. Steve Cohen, said the address could further fuel Israel's detractors in the United States. ""The Palestinian cause has gained more and more support over the years,"" he said. ""I think this has given more reason for people who might've been in the middle to side with the Palestinians."" A Gallup Poll out this week underscored Cohen's point. It found that the percentage of Democrats sympathizing with Israelis over Palestinians fell 10 points over the past year, to 48%, which Gallup pollster Lydia Saad wrote was ""possibly reflecting the tension between Obama and Netanyahu."" Meanwhile, Republican approval of Israel has continued to grow. Eighty-three percent of Republicans supported Israelis over Palestinians in the Gallup survey. That number compensated for the steep drop in support from Democrats so that overall support for Israel among Americans remained steady. The Democratic dip aligns with what many Democrats say is a growing pro-Palestinian streak within the progressive wing of the party, which is calling for U.S. leaders to be tougher on Israel and offer stronger support for Palestinian statehood. Cohen said that trend could influence Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill. ""We've got our opinions, but we respond to our constituents as well,"" he said. ""If they get to be less pro-Israel, it makes it more difficult for us to support Israel."" Some expressed concerns that Netanyahu's speech could also exacerbate demographic trends that suggest younger Americans may not offer as robust support for Israel as older Americans do. Greg Rosenbaum, chairman of the board of the National Jewish Democratic Council, said he's seen less enthusiastic support among younger voters because, he believes, most of them have never experienced a world in which Israel was endangered and needed the strong backing of the United States. ""My concern about the long-term health of the U.S.-Israel relationship and the rock-solid bipartisanship it needs is that the more that Israel does that calls into question the support of this cohort of younger voters, the less it is going to be able to rely on this reservoir of good will,"" he said. Democrats argue that Boehner sought to exploit this growing gap in Democratic support by inviting Netanyahu to rebut the President in his own backyard, without adequately consulting with the White House. Former Democratic Rep. Mel Levine, an outspoken supporter of Israel and critic of Netanyahu's move, referred to the invite as a ploy by Boehner intended to drive a wedge within the Democratic Party's backing for Israel. ""Speaker Boehner cooking up a scheme to invite the Prime Minister a few weeks before the election in Israel is very harmful to the U.S.-Israel relationship, and particularly harmful to constituents that have traditionally been very, very loyal to Israel but not sympathetic to the policies of the Israeli government,"" he said. The White House cited the proximity to the Israeli election in declining to arrange a Netanyau-Obama meeting during the Prime Minister's visit to Washington. The eventual GOP aim, skeptics assert, is to coalesce Jewish voters and major Jewish donors behind Republicans. Even those sounding the alarm over the potential politicization of Israel acknowledge that Democratic support for Israel, and Jewish support for the Democratic Party, remains strong. But if current trends continue, the United States could see a significant partisan shift on the issue in the coming decades. American Jews' support for the Republican party has been growing as the population becomes more Orthodox and as some have become more critical of Obama's policies in the Middle East. According to a Pew Forum analysis of exit polling data on midterm House elections, 33% of Jews voted for Republicans in 2014, up from  12% in 2006. And the more observant Jewish voters are, the more Republican they tend to become. A 2013 Pew Forum survey of Jewish Americans found that Orthodox Jews, who are typically younger and have bigger families, lean Republican over Democratic by a 57% to 36% margin. That suggests the Jewish population as a whole may become increasingly Republican in the coming decades. Boehner's office pushed back against the claim of Republican machinations in the Netanyahu invite, with spokesman Michael Steel saying that ""support for the state of Israel in Congress and in America has always been bipartisan, and we hope it always will be."" But the White House has charged that Boehner's invitation was indeed motivated by partisanship — as well as Netanyahu's decision to accept so close to the Israeli vote — and on that basis has been particularly damaging to U.S.-Israel ties. ""On both sides, there has now been injected a degree of partisanship, which is not only unfortunate, I think it's destructive of the fabric of the relationship,"" National Security Adviser Susan Rice told journalist Charlie Rose on Tuesday. Republicans have argued it's Democrats who are politicizing the issue by refusing to attend a speech by a visiting head of state, one of the strongest U.S. allies abroad, and pointed to Rice's comments as further evidence that Democrats are at fault. But even some of Netanyahu's supporters acknowledge both sides may be to blame for the politicization of the issue. Malcolm Hoenlein, head of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations and a close ally of Netanyahu, said ""mistakes were made on both sides in the process."" He said it was still in dispute whether Boehner mismanaged the invitation, but emphasized that the controversy was past and that the two nations need to move on. Hoenlein echoed concerns of Democrats that politicizing Israel could have grave practical consequences for both nations. ""We don't want this to ever become in any way partisan. It never has been. It can't be now. And all those who try to make it partisan, I think, should be held to account,"" he said. Rosenbaum warned that the recent flap is likely to leave lasting damage. He charged that the GOP efforts ""to make Israel a wedge issue"" are ""something they appear to be engaging in for short-term political gain but we believe will have a long-term negative impact.""","Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to Congress threatens U.S. bipartisanship on Israel .

"New Delhi (CNN)""India is about to take off."" That was the bold declaration from India's Finance Minister Arun Jaitley as he delivered his first full-year budget since his party won a resounding victory at the polls last May. India's budget is a closely-watched TV event, with pre- and post-game analyses on every TV news channel. Even by those standards, Saturday's budget generated more interest than in previous years, in part because of soaring expectations on the new government. Jaitley signaled in his speech that ""incremental change"" was not enough, as he announced a raft of measures to boost infrastructure and growth. Among the key announcements, Jaitley promised that a widely anticipated national Goods and Services Tax (GST) would be implemented by April 1, 2016. As CNN has reported, India's states have a myriad of different taxes, making trading between them a nightmare. A number of other announcements called for additional government spending in energy and housing. Jaitley announced an increase of $11.3 billion in infrastructure. He also promised a universal social security plan -- a vital need for India's millions of poor who have no access to pensions or health care. Perhaps the biggest cheer from the stock markets -- a special trading session was held Saturday -- came when Jaitley announced a cut in the corporate tax rate from 30% to 25%. But it wasn't all about spending. Jaitley also announced a new 2% tax of the super rich, and promised a hefty 10 year prison sentence for people caught evading taxes. Avoiding income tax is common in India, with only 3% of Indians filing returns. On Indian TV channels, scores of analysts began to weigh in on the impacts of the budget. Tarun Das, who ran India's Confederation of Indian Industry for 30 years told NDTV that he couldn't find a negative in Jaitley's presentation. ""It's a creative, confident budget,"" he said. ""There's a lot for a lot of people."" On the show Headlines Today, another regular commentator, Gurcharan Das, complimented the budget but said it stopped short of detail. Speaking of Jaitley's boss, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said ""Modi was elected to control inflation and create jobs. He's controlled inflation, but he needs to show us how he will create jobs."" Ahead of Saturday's budget, India released its annual economic survey on Friday. The data produced by the government showed that India is projected to grow as fast as 8.5% in 2016, making it the fastest growing large economy in the world. The data was calculated according to a new methodology.","India's budget announcement is a televised, highly watched event .
This year, Indian's paid particular attention, as they have high expectations from the Modi government ."
"Irbil, Iraq (CNN)They take sledgehammers to statues with an uncommon gusto -- destroying in seconds what may have survived centuries. New video released by ISIS shows militants smashing what they say are antiquities at a museum in Mosul, Iraq. Men shove statues off pedestals, and use hammers and drills to destroy what's left. An unnamed militant offers the following explanation: ""These antiquities and idols behind me were from people in past centuries and were worshiped instead of God. ""When God Almighty orders us to destroy these statues, idols and antiquities, we must do it, even if they're worth billions of dollars,"" he says. It's not clear from the footage how many of the pieces were originals, versus replicas. Experts are clear in saying, however, the video represents a clear loss. Qais Hussain Rashid, director general of Iraqi museums at the Ministry of Antiquities and Tourism, said Friday on Iraqiya TV that most of the artifacts shown in the ISIS video were real -- including a famed, millennia-old winged bull that's seen being defaced with a drill. ""Mosul Museum has 173 original pieces, and there were preparations to reopen the Mosul Museum before ISIS invaded the city in June 2014,"" Rashid said. He added that Mosul has more than 1,700 historical sites that are potentially at risk. ""On repeated viewing of that very grainy video, we now suspect that there (were) far more originals in the museum than I first thought,"" said Eleanor Robson, chairwoman of the British Institute for the Study of Iraq. ""Whilst there was indeed a program to relocate antiquities to safekeeping in Baghdad, it looks now as though it didn't reach that particular museum."" ""I condemn this as a deliberate attack against Iraq's millennial history and culture, and as an inflammatory incitement to violence and hatred,"" said Irina Bokova, director-general of UNESCO, the United Nations cultural organization. ""This attack is far more than a cultural tragedy -- this is also a security issue as it fuels sectarianism, violent extremism and conflict in Iraq,"" she said, calling for an emergency meeting of the Security Council to protect Iraq's cultural heritage. How ISIS is run . CNN has extensively reported on ISIS' destruction of some ancient and deeply meaningful sites in that country. Officials there have said ISIS has blown up shrines such as the tomb of Jonah. Its motives are not purely ideological, however; ISIS makes money off looting. Rashid has told CNN that ISIS sells stolen antiquities to criminals and antique dealers on the black market. Everything to know about the rise of ISIS . The militant group also allows locals to dig at ancient sites as long as those people give ISIS a percentage of the monetary value of anything found, according to a September 2014 New York Times opinion piece written by three people who had recently returned from southern Turkey and interviewed people who live and work in ISIS-controlled territory. ISIS' system of profiteering from antiquities thieving is very complicated, the three said, adding that for some areas along the Euphrates River, ISIS leaders encourage semiprofessional field crews to dig.

"(CNN)Magma and lava from a Japanese volcano is forming new geography in a remote part of the Pacific Ocean. An eruption on the tiny volcanic island of Nishinoshima in November 2013 formed a small islet right next to it when molten lava cooled. That islet has merged with its neighbor and continues to develop. The newly formed island has grown to 2.46 square kilometers (.94 square miles), according to the Japanese coast guard, which sent an observation plane to the area this week. The coast guard said it's 52 times bigger than the iconic Tokyo Dome. And it's expected to get larger. The volcano is erupting five to six times a minute, spewing out volcanic rock, the coast guard says. The evolving land mass is 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) south of Tokyo.

"(CNN)The Federal Communications Commission got it right on ""net neutrality."" So did President Obama, who took a bold stand in favor of keeping the Internet free. So did leaders such as Reps. John Lewis, Keith Ellison and Maxine Waters, and the Rev. William Barber II, one of the architects of ""Moral Mondays"" protests and a member of the national board of the NAACP. So did the United Church of Christ, as well as more than 100 social justice and civil rights groups. And so did countless progressive, people-powered groups, such as Color of Change, an online community (which I helped to found) dedicated to bringing about positive change for African-Americans. Ditto for tiny, grassroots dynamos like Oakland's Center for Media Justice, led by Malkia Cyril. You know who got it dead, dead wrong? As much as it pains me to say it: Far too many of our old-school civil rights organizations. Since the first days of the Internet, one principle has been in place. Put simply, it is that ""owning the pipes"" does not give you license to mess with what flows through them. Internet service providers (ISPs) can charge a fee to provide Internet access. But they cannot block or censor content they do not like, or charge for a fast lane, or relegate companies that do not pay up to slow Internet speeds that could frustrate customers. All the FCC did this week was keep that principle in place. They made sure the Internet will work the same way the phones do -- a call to the small business down the street does not sound worse or cost more than one to a big chain store. ISPs like Verizon and Comcast stood to make a killing from blocking this change. But what is shocking is that some trusted civil rights organizations -- including the National Urban League, NAACP, and Rainbow Push -- actively helped the ISPs make their case. Worst of all, it was a completely avoidable error. They should have known that the argument that large ISPs would expand access to under-served communities if they enjoyed higher profit margins was out of line with history and common sense. It was essentially ""trickle-down dial-up,"" and you would not expect civil rights leadership to fall for it. They should have been paying attention when the ISPs told investors that a decision in favor of net neutrality would not cause these companies to rethink their broadband investments, while telling the FCC the exact opposite. In most black households -- in most households of any color -- that is called lying. And most importantly, they should have realized that African-Americans need Internet freedom to preserve our political voices, and foster a generation of young, black entrepreneurs taking on entrenched businesses. As a co-founder of #YesWeCode, an initiative to help train 100,000 young people from low-opportunity communities for careers in coding, I have met amazing young people who have the smarts and the creativity. On a level playing field, they can compete with anyone. But if they must pay extortionist fees while the websites of competitors run much faster? If that happens, we all suffer. Silicon Valley understood this. Black leaders and Fortune 500 companies and churches and Color of Change understood this. But the civil rights groups that persisted in citing telecom talking points? I love them, but they have a little bit of egg on their face today. The one hope is that it is not too late. Republicans and ISPs have given no indication that they will stop fighting or cease seeking to relitigate this battle. They will undoubtedly be eager to use civil rights groups as cover. In other words, some of the legacy civil rights groups got it wrong.

"(CNN)During the reopening of the Baghdad Museum on Saturday, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi made one thing clear: The artwork that epitomizes Iraq's culture and history will not be wiped away by anyone or anything, including ISIS. ""They are trying, with their barbarism and arrogance, to destroy the inheritance of humanity, the inheritance of Iraqi people and their civilization, [the] same way they destroyed humans,"" al-Abadi said. ""I want to send clear message from here in Baghdad, that we will preserve this human civilization and its inheritance, and we will pursue those who are trying to destroy it."" The Prime Minister's comments came after a video was released by ISIS purporting to show militants smashing and shattering pieces at a museum in Mosul. ""These antiquities and idols behind me were from people in past centuries and were worshiped instead of God,"" one masked man said in the clip. ""When God Almighty orders us to destroy these statues, idols and antiquities, we must do it, even if they're worth billions of dollars."" It isn't clear from the video how many artifacts were lost or how many of those destroyed were originals. There's reason to believe that some pieces were spared, according to Qais Hussain Rashid, the director general of Iraqi museums at the Ministry of Antiquities and Tourism. He told CNN that ISIS sells stolen antiquities on the black market to finance their operations. The Prime Minister also mentioned the smuggling reports in his speech on Saturday. He also alleged that ISIS is receiving some sort of assistance in its smuggling operation, though he did not specify any organization in particular. ""We have all the details on all the antiquities in Mosul, every single piece is marked, numbered and saved in our records,"" he said. ""Therefore, we will pursue all these antiquities."" The Mosul Museum has 173 original pieces, according to Rashid. Also, reports began to surface about a month ago that ISIS militants were burning thousands of books and manuscripts from museums, libraries and universities in Mosul. Those reports amount to ""a new phase in the cultural cleansing"" being perpetrated by the extremist group, UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova said in a news release. If the reports of book burnings are confirmed, the U.N. cultural agency said, ""this would be one of the most devastating acts of destruction of library collections in human history."" CNN's Ben Wedeman and Dana Ford contributed to this report.","Iraqi Prime Minister says ISIS is trying to ""destroy the inheritance of humanity""

"(CNN)Our minds still try to resist the idea that someone is willing to kill another human being because of the words that he or she writes. Yet that is exactly what happened to Avijit Roy, an American citizen hacked to death by men brandishing knives and machetes during a trip to his native Bangladesh. Roy and his wife, Rafida Ahmed Bonya, now in critical condition after also being attacked Thursday, were in Bangladesh to attend the national book fair, where Roy was promoting his books advocating tolerance, education and secular humanism. Why was he killed? At the time of writing, the perpetrators had not been caught, but there seems little doubt he was killed by Islamist radicals, who were likely angered by his devastatingly critical writings. Just last month he wrote about the Charlie Hebdo killings in Paris and the December 16 massacre in Peshawar, Pakistan, in which Pakistani Taliban opened fire inside a school, killing 145 people, including 132 children. ""To me,"" he wrote, ""such religious extremism is like a highly contagious virus."" Roy strongly disagreed with President Barack Obama's statements distancing the so-called Islamic State from Islam. ""ISIS,"" he said, ""is what unfolds when the virus of faith launches into action and the outbreak becomes an epidemic."" His assassination came the same day we learned  the identity of the man known as Jihadi John, infamous for narrating in English as Western hostages of ISIS were decapitated. He has been identified as the London-raised, university educated Mohammed Emwazi. Taken together, these two tragedies help shed light on what motivates people to conduct these brutal acts. The revelations about Emwazi's life story were pieced together with the help of an organization that wants to make us believe Jihadi John's radicalization is the fault of the British security services, not of a murderous, apocalyptic ideology that helped make 2014 the deadliest year for terrorist attacks on record. According to the Washington Post, which relies partly on information from a group called CAGE, Emwazi was described by some as a perfectly normal young Londoner, showing no signs of becoming the barbaric murderer he is alleged to have become, until security services started harassing him. The problems began, friends referred to in the article would have us believe, when he tried to go on safari to Tanzania with a couple of friends. He was stopped in Tanzania, and according to the article, he claims he was accused of planning to travel to Somalia, where the al Qaeda affiliate al Shabaab has been conducting its reign of terror. An official from CAGE, which is described by the Washington Post as a ""rights group,"" described  Emwazi as ""extremely kind, extremely gentle,"" before Britain's MI5 started making his life hell for no apparent reason other than that he was a Muslim. It is a misleading interpretation of events, one seemingly aimed at furthering the alleged agenda of CAGE. Indeed, reports suggest that the security services had reason to believe Emwazi was already engaged in supporting Somalia's al Shabaab before his troubles began. Any ""harassment"" he experienced therefore seems more likely to have been because he was regarded as a threat. And that reality seems to get at a very real truth in all this -- people who decapitate journalists, or who hack to death bloggers, or who massacre Shiite Muslims, or set on fire fellow Sunni Muslims don't do it because the authorities in London weren't kind enough toward them. And the blame for the acts of murderous extremism we are seeing cannot be laid at the door of poverty, lack of jobs or anti-Muslim prejudice. As Roy so accurately pointed out, and as his death tragically demonstrates, the culprit is an apocalyptic, ultra-extremist ideology that religiously justifies every atrocity as it seeks to intimidate its foes and impose its vision. Meanwhile, claims that the ""root causes"" of Islamist extremism lie in unemployment or prejudice simply serve to derail the campaign to eradicate it. Of course, unemployment and prejudice are ills that must be fought. But they are not what is getting bloggers like Ahmed Rajib Haider -- hacked to death in the streets of Dhaka in 2013 -- killed. And it is not just atheists who are at risk, something that most Muslims fully understand; these extremists are just as likely to target a Shiite, a moderate Sunni, or anyone else who wants to live in the modern world or who disagrees with their extremist ideas. Still, as an outspoken atheist, Roy knew that his views were putting his life in danger. He wrote about how last year, at the same Dhaka book fair, his book ""The Virus of Faith"" quickly rose to the top of the fair's best-seller list. It was enormously popular, but also ""hit the cranial nerve of Islamic fundamentalists."" That's when the death threats started pouring in across social media. ""I suddenly found myself a target of militant Islamists and terrorists,"" he wrote. In 2014, local media reported on some of the threats coming out of a local college known as a stronghold of politicized religious extremists. One Facebook post read ""Avijit Roy lives in America and so it is not possible to kill him right now. He will be murdered when he comes back."" And so he was. The Islamist group Ansar Bangla-7 reportedly tweeted after Roy's killing, ""Target Down here in Bangladesh."" Roy was right about where the threat lies: in a dangerous ideology that takes religious teachings to their most extreme interpretation.  He was working to counteract its effects, to open minds. And he understood the one thing that can be so difficult for the rest of us to fully comprehend: that there are people prepared to kill someone else just because of what they believe or what they write. Nothing could be more dangerous to a society, and to the basic rights of all human beings. Roy's tragic death is the latest reminder of that.","Bangladeshi-American blogger Avijit Roy was killed Thursday .

"(CNN)Imagine an American billionaire who is so callous that he could fly into Davos, Switzerland, for the annual World Economic Conference and announce that ""America's lifestyle expectations are far too high and need to be adjusted so we have less things and a smaller, better existence."" Pretty outrageous, don't you think? It gets worse. The guy took a pounding, as some of the snarkier commentary noted that he had arrived in Switzerland via private aircraft with two nannies in tow. I would have joined the criticism -- how insensitive could that fellow be? Except the quote was credited to me and I know that I never said it. Most public people have experienced interview mishaps, and typically it's a matter of a mistake, or misinterpretation. The most generous thing I can say about the article that was published after that interview was that perhaps the reporter didn't hear half of what I said. I do talk fast, and the conditions were not ideal. But what bothered me most in all this was how this whole incident fed a narrative that the wealthy are detached, that they just don't care. And, just as bad, they attend meetings like Davos simply to give the impression that they do. In fact, the people I spoke with while I was there were without exception concerned about the struggles of individuals and families affected by globalization, disruptive technologies, and most of all the long-term challenge of economic inequality. I can say these things from experience -- I have often talked about this issue, calling for policies to bolster the middle class and even expressing support for increasing taxes on the wealthy. As a guy who grew up in middle class Worcester, Massachusetts, I know how hard people work just to make ends meet and how years of stalled income growth can drain people of their hope and optimism. I saw it myself growing up when my father lost his business. As a result of what I have seen and experienced growing up and as a businessman I have continued to the problem of inequality many times and voiced support for education, investment in infrastructure, and economic policies to aid those who are middle class and those who aspire to be. The trouble is that too often, our elected leaders aren't listening -- and they are making decisions today that are undermining this country's future. The reality is that in a global marketplace, people from Indianapolis to Indonesia are often competing for some of the same work with comparable skills. Meanwhile, new technologies are allowing companies to make the same goods, or provide the same services, with fewer people. The result is that our workers are being squeezed on both the supply and demand side, as the labor supply in many industries falls, prompting a decline in wages and overall employment. Here in the United States, we have traditionally counted on superior skills and a strong service economy to counter the effects of international competition. However, in recent years, workers in other countries have become better educated and more qualified, allowing them to compete more aggressively. Transportation offers a telling example as app-based services including Uber and Lyft instantly connect drivers in their own cars with customers who need a ride. Consumers get cheaper transport, and car owners get to earn some money with a vehicle that would otherwise be idle. But Uber will inevitably undermine established car services, and firms that directly pay wages and benefits to workers such as drivers, mechanics, managers and dispatchers. Yes, you may get a cheaper ride across town today, but the cabbie who is put out of work had his or her life turned upside down. Other big industries will be disrupted by 3-D printing, a near miraculous technology capable of creating a perfect prosthesis for someone who lost a leg, or printing an entire building in China. In the not-so-distant future, we may all have these machines in our homes or neighborhoods. The most important manufacturing companies may be those that make the machines and those that make the materials that go into the printers, something that again will most likely require few workers. These developments pose a profound challenge to the United States, and we'll need a comprehensive strategy that draws on the best ideas available to ensure everyone has a chance to succeed. President Barack Obama's recent proposal for free community college for all is a good first step. But what the U.S. economy really needs is an over-arching policy to promote lifelong learning, so that workers can continually adapt to new market opportunities. In addition, we also need a stronger safety net for the workers who are displaced, which would give more people time to adjust to a continually changing job market. Unfortunately, the policies we need will not emerge from a media-driven debate that starts with the premise that uncaring rich guys aren't concerned about others. Closing the gap is going to take innovative thinking and a willingness to believe that we are all in this together. We are going to have to trust each other, drop our assumptions, and make a commitment to open and accurate debate.  I'm willing to do so, even at the risk of being cast, unfairly, as the poster boy for the insensitive upper class.","Jeff Greene: People from Indianapolis to Indonesia competing for some of same work .

"(CNN)I'm not one of those crazy Trekkies -- you know, those fanatics who go to Star Trek conventions and own all kinds of preciously cheesy Star Trek memorabilia. All I have is a model communicator with a flip-lid that makes three different sound effects. And a Federation of Planets command badge. And the complete DVD set of the Star Trek animated series. And knowledge of every plot line of every episode of the original series. And, somewhere in my mom's attic, an original hardbound edition of ""Star Fleet Technical Manual,"" which contains the schematics of every class of starship in the Federation, as well as the color schemes and insignia for all Star Fleet uniforms. And, of course, there's my official first-grade school portrait, taken in a green Star Trek uniform (little known fact: the yellow uniforms made famous by Captain Kirk originally were green but took on a more golden hue on camera). So, no, I'm not a fanatic. I am just an American who happened to grow up in the early 1970s, when ""Star Trek"" aired, in syndication, every Saturday at 6 p.m. on WPIX in the New York Tri-State area and occupied the entirety of my youthful imagination. And when I consider the massive national outpouring of love and wonder and wistfulness after the death of Leonard Nimoy, I realize the reaction is not just about the iconic character called Mr. Spock. It's not even about the series itself. It's about the vision of society that ""Star Trek"" embodied. Imagine: Scots and Russians, people of Irish and Japanese and African descent, humans and Vulcans, all thriving together as a crew without having to downplay their differences -- indeed, by activating those differences. That vision must have seemed truly like science fiction to adults living through the fractious, polarized, flying-apart '70s. It seems similarly fantastic in our own times. But it's a vision that endures, especially in the heart of a second-generation kid like me. As the son of Chinese immigrants, growing up on a mainly white suburban street called Old English Way, I was especially susceptible to such a vision. ""Star Trek"" showed me a way of being -- of being American -- that was about inclusion without assimilation. Participation without self-obliteration. Its diversity was not mere tokenism; its diversity was in fact the raw material of excellence. And all that diversity was subsumed to a larger cause (that of the Federation) and a more urgent mission (that of the Enterprise). You might think that because I'm Asian I was drawn to Lieutenant Sulu as a role model. Or that because my bowl cut looked startlingly like Spock's I was drawn to him. I did like George Takei as Sulu (and love him even more today on social media). And I definitely rocked the bowl cut. But the genius of the show was that it allowed a young viewer to identify with characters beyond the surface markers of identity. Whatever I might have looked like, in my mind I was Kirk. I was in command. I spent countless hours pretending to be him, conjuring up scenes of dangerous exploration and silently narrating a Captain's log as I moved cautiously through my house grasping a wooden phaser my neighbor had jigsawed for me. Other times I would just revel in being part of this Federation, this greater good. As my mom made stir-fry I would lie on the kitchen floor, moving my flattened palm above me like it was the Enterprise traversing the galaxy. I would go through reams of the ""bai zhi"" (white paper) my dad brought from the office, drawing colorful storybooks with brand-new ""Trek"" adventures. I was never conscious of why I was so drawn to this imaginary realm. But I see today how much it shaped my spirit. And shapes it still. The nation I'm trying to build in my work as a grownup looks a lot like the society I lost myself in as a boy. Today in American life, when we are divided along so many chasms of race, class, faith and ideology, when it's becoming more challenging than ever to sustain a cohesive sense of shared identity, we should remember two lessons from ""Star Trek."" First, what matters most is not diversity but what we do with it -- how we make inclusive institutions and experiences that fully leverage its power. And second, we have a greater mission than mere expression of self. As citizens of the United States, we're here to show the world how to be a unified crew. We've got some work to do. ""Live long and prosper"" were perhaps Mr. Spock's most famous watchwords. But to my mind, his character conjures up a different dictum: ""E Pluribus Unum."" From many, one. A more earthly ambition, perhaps, but still worthy of our imagination.","Eric Liu: I was fully into Star Trek as a young boy in an immigrant household .

"(CNN)In Moscow on February 27, 2015, a lone gunman killed Boris Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister and a powerful and charismatic opposition leader who stood as an alternative to Vladimir Putin. In Leningrad on December 1, 1934, a lone gunman killed Sergey Kirov, a powerful Bolshevik who stood as an alternative to Josef Stalin. Stalin's involvement in the murder was denied, and never proved. It goes without saying that the Kremlin also was quick to deny Putin's involvement in Nemtsov's death. The parallels are worth considering. The murder of Kirov marked the beginning of the great purges, the period in which high-level elites were so thoroughly ""cleansed"" that the USSR stood unprepared for Hitler's invasion. Similarly today, Putin's actions in Ukraine and his refusal to share power with a modernizing elite has condemned Russia to another generation of economic backwardness and political isolation. Of course, Kirov wasn't the first political opponent to fall, any more than Nemtsov was. Rival political party leaders had been sent by Lenin to camps in the 1920s, and opposition political movements, including in Ukraine, had struggled to defeat Bolshevik collectivization in the early 1930s. But this was the first top-level political assassination of a person who could have become party leader. Similarly under Putin, political opponents have been killed, like journalist Anna Politkovskaya and Alexander Litvinenko, but they did not aspire to the presidency. And certainly much of the Putin era has been absorbed with the suppression of opposition political movements, whether in Russia, by keeping rival party leaders from registering for elections, or abroad ,by invading Georgia, Crimea and eastern Ukraine to prevent democratic regimes from succeeding in neighboring states.  In the death of Nemtsov, irrespective of who is ultimately found responsible, we once again have the assassination of a person who could have become the leader of the country. Stalin's search for Kirov's murderers led to a second set of crimes, the escalation of repression against the Old Bolsheviks and the show trials of the mid-1930s. Over a dozen of the founding members of the Bolshevik Party were found guilty of complicity in the murder in trumped-up show trials and executed. The question now becomes whether Kremlin's leaders imagine that they can  take the country down a similar path of isolation and ultimate destruction? Or more likely, is the Kremlin thinking at all, or just allowing the terrible logic of this system they have created to unfold? When the Kremlin publicly labels the opposition leaders as enemies, and spews out nothing but hatred toward those who have a right to demand freedom, then killings -- irrespective of who pulled the trigger -- are a logical result. The Putin regime has succeeded over the last 15 years in establishing a regime that historically is unparalleled in its thievery. Nemtsov himself had been the first person to start a systematic analysis of Putin's corruption that, he claimed, includes the building and renovation of 20 palaces, the receipt of $700,000 in watches, his unlimited access to yachts, planes, and a Kremlin property management department with a staff of more than 60,000, and an annual presidential office budget of $2.41 billion. This all leaves aside the billions he is reported to have stashed abroad. The regime hides successfully behind Kremlin-controlled patriotism and expansionism, making its actions in Ukraine out to be a response of local Russian-speaking populations to NATO aggression in support of a fascist junta in Kiev. The perfidy of the regime is quite unparalleled since Hitler hid his expansionism behind the desire to reunite German-speakers in the Sudetenland. There is however an optimistic side. The population in Russia as a whole and in the large cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg in particular is not like the first-generation peasants of the Stalin era.  They have traveled, they know what rule-of-law systems look like, and they know what property protection feels like. They can (for now) still connect with each other on social media. Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube are all alive with information, commiserations, and expressions of extreme anger against the Kremlin. Nemtsov had thousands of followers on social media, and many of his friends also have thousands of followers. Other opposition leaders like Aleksey Navalny, Ilya Yashin, Ksenya Sobchak, and many more remain, and they are both shocked and defiant. Former prime minister Mikhail Kasyanov wrote on his blog: ""Bastards, you killed my friend in the center of Moscow...with four bullets, to make the point to all of us free-thinking people....The country is rolling off the cliff.""  The march against the war in Ukraine Nemtsov had planned for Sunday has been rescheduled as a march in his memory. One can only hope it will attract large numbers. The spokesman for the Investigative Committee, Vladimir Markin, cautioned the press not to jump to conclusions and then proceeded to put up a bewildering array of possible motives that included everything except Kremlin jealousy: He called the act a political provocation perhaps perpetrated by Islamic extremists angered over his stand on the Charlie Hebdo killing; or a ""sacral sacrifice"" by the opposition itself to destabilize the country; or related to his views on the Ukrainian war;  or a business conflict; or an assault related to his personal life. The fact that Nemtsov's girlfriend was Ukrainian and she was with him when he died was immediately picked up by Russian media. Putin called the assassination an apparent ""contract killing"" and stated he was taking charge of the investigation. And despite the fact that initial eyewitness reports stated that the killers were driving a white car without license plates, by noon the next day, RT was claiming that the car had been found, now with license plates from the Muslim republic of Ingushetia. The sad fact is that Western powers did not understand the significance of the killing of Kirov. Let's hope that this time they will see Nemtsov's death as the ""shot that was heard around the world"" and mobilize to deter further Russian oppression and expansionism. President Obama quickly condemned the murder and stated that ""I admired Nemtsov's courageous dedication to the struggle against corruption in Russia and appreciated his willingness to share his candid views with me when we met in Moscow in 2009.""  That would mean providing all forms of assistance to prevent the failure of Ukrainian democracy, a dream for which Nemtsov could well have died. How to help the Russian opposition depends on whether they will be able to help themselves in the weeks to come. No one would want to be in their shoes. But standing with them in their insistence -- echoing Nemtsov -- that Putin's authoritarian regime is based on massive corruption, will be more important than ever.","Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov gunned down in Moscow .

"Cairo (CNN)An Egyptian court has ruled that Hamas is a terrorist organization, according to an Egyptian state-run media organization. Hamas, the Islamist group which dominates the Gaza strip, has been at odds with the Egyptian government since the country's former President, Mohammed Morsy, was ousted in a coup in the summer of 2013. Morsy was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist political organization that shares deep ties with Hamas. The government formed after Morsy's ouster designated the Brotherhood as a terrorist group in December 2013; since then, many of its leaders have been charged with supporting terrorism. Hamas quickly denounced the decision at a news conference. ""It is a shocking and dangerous decision that targets the Palestinian people,"" Fawzi Barhoum, a Hamas spokesman, said at a news conference. ""It will directly contaminate the reputation of Egypt."" CNN has attempted to reach Mousa Abu Marzouk, the Hamas representative in Egypt, for comment. For years Egypt has played a major role in peace negotiations between Israel and various Palestinian factions, with Egypt being seen as fairly impartial by both sides. It's possible the new ruling will affect Egypt's position as a mediator between the two sides. The United States and European Union have both designated Hamas as a terrorist organization. Egypt's Urgent Matters Court based its ruling on Hamas in part on claims the organization had supported insurgents who have staged attacks in the Sinai Peninsula, a region that has been fraught with instability in recent months. The armed wing of Hamas, the al Qassam Brigades, was designated a terror group by the same court last month. This ruling comes a week after Egypt passed the Terrorist Entities Law, which spells out how to declare a group a terrorist organization, according to Ahmed Ragheb, head of the National Group for Human Rights and Law. That new law states that the prosecutor general has to propose declaring a terrorist organization; that decision has to approved by the appeals court, Ragheb said. That means the court that made the decision did not have authority to do so. Typically, foreign policy decisions in Egypt are left to the executive branch of government. Under the law, authorities can also issue travel bans and freeze the assets of terror designees. CNN's Sara Mazloumsaki and journalist Sarah Sirgany contributed to this report.","Hamas spokesman says decision will ""contaminate the reputation of Egypt""

"(CNN)The Internet is a dangerous place for Mariam Veiszadeh right now. It's where death threats lurk and vile messages appear faster than they can be deleted. But it's also a place where support is growing in a Twitter counter-campaign -- #IStandWithMariam -- to the urgings of a U.S.-based white supremacist website, the Daily Stormer, to ""be as nasty, hurtful, hateful, offensive, insulting and 'vilifying' as you possibly can."" And they have been. ""Leave now before we behead your mother and bury you all with pigs..."" said one tweet from an account, which has since been suspended. Many of the messages include extremely offensive hashtags. Veiszadeh, an Australian lawyer and founder of the Islamophobia Register, which tracks instances of abuse against Muslims, knows exactly why she's being targeted. ""The reality is people don't abuse me just because I'm a woman or because my name is Mariam or because I'm Middle-Eastern. They abuse me because I have a scarf on my head and because I'm a Muslim,"" Veiszadeh told CNN. Last October, Veiszadeh posted an image of a T-shirt for sale in Woolworths, one of Australia's biggest retailers, which showed the Australian flag with the words ""If you don't love it, leave."" She called the shirt ""bigoted,"" a flood of complaints followed and the shirt was withdrawn from sale. Woolworths apologized and blamed an ordering error, saying it ""should never have been on our shelves."" That could have been the end of it. However, three months later, the Australian Defence League (ADL) -- a right-wing group that's calling for Islam to be banned in Australia -- posted Veiszadeh's tweet on its Facebook site, along with another one she posted saying ""Everyone  is entitled to dress as they please,"" with the title ""Hypocrisy Much?"" The post attracted dozens of offensive comments. Abusive tweets followed but the campaign took a more sinister -- and organized -- twist when the Daily Stormer implored its ""troll army"" to attack her. The post, in part, justifies the attack as revenge for the prosecution of a 22-year-old woman from Ipswich, in the Australian state of Queensland. The woman allegedly sent a stream of invective to Veiszadeh, calling her a tramp, whore, ""rag head"" and other offensive names. She's been charged with ""using a carriage service to menace, harass or cause offense"" and is due to appear on court on March 11. On the blog post calling for the tirade of abuse, the Daily Stormer publisher justifies the attack by saying attempts to ban freedom of speech ""should be responded to with the most ridiculous conceivable hateful speech."" It recalls a similar ""successful"" campaign against Luciana Berger, a British MP who was targeted with a barrage of abusive messages after a man was jailed for sending her an anti-Semitic tweet. ""The goal of these operations is to purposefully enrage the target, so as to escalate the situation to the level of media attention, and the method for doing that is through the most extreme speech possible,"" writes Daily Stormer publisher Andrew Anglin on one blogpost. He said attention would force a discussion about whether people should be jailed for hate speech, concluding that ""the vast majority of White (sic) people do not think name-calling should be an imprisonable offense."" Veiszadeh is adamant the campaign of intimidation will not be successful. ""If their stated objective is to silence me, then my stated objective is to do the exact opposite,"" she said. Earlier this week, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott foreshadowed tougher penalties for hate speech, as part of a move to strengthen the country's counter-terrorism laws. ""No one should make excuses for Islamist fanatics or their imitators here in Australia,"" Abbott said. Australia's Race Discrimination Commissioner Tim Soutphommasane -- who himself has been the target of a Daily Stormer hate campaign -- says the country's current laws under the Racial Discrimination Act ""send an important message to bigots and racists."" ""Those who peddle messages of hatred should be made to answer for their extremism. And they should know that the rest of Australian society rejects their promotion of fear and division,"" he said. However, the Racial Discrimination Act does not cover attacks on a person based on their religious beliefs. That's covered by state laws, which vary from state to state. Veiszadeh said in New South Wales, where most of Australia's Muslims live, there's no law to cover Muslims who are abused on the basis of their religion. Of the Queensland woman due to face court, Veiszadeh said, ""Had this woman not referred to my ethnicity, I would have absolutely no grounds to take action against her."" But even a change in Australian law wouldn't solve the issue of attacks emanating from outside the country by trolls who create multiple fake accounts to attack then vanish. The Daily Stormer has issued instructions to its followers on exactly how to do it, reminding them not to threaten violence (though some have), presumably in an attempt to avoid legal action. Right now, Veiszadeh is concentrating on naming the trolls and urging her 15,000 followers to block their accounts. ""I'm still getting horrifying images and abusive tweets but, as bad as that sounds, I've become accustomed to it. I've developed a thick skin and for me it's about exposing bigotry and raising awareness about Islamophobia.""","Australian lawyer receives barrage of abuse at the urgings of a U.S. website .

"(CNN)Four Gulf countries now have opened embassies in Aden, Yemen, where President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi fled after being deposed. The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait opened their embassies Friday,  two Foreign Ministry officials who didn't want to be named because they are connected to Hadi told CNN. The move came one day after the Saudis and Qataris shifted their embassy staffs there. Sanaa is Yemen's capital, but Houthi rebels have controlled the city for months. Hadi escaped a week ago after being under house arrest for a month following his resignation under pressure from the rebels. After fleeing to Aden in the south, he released a statement declaring he is still President of Yemen, and calling all political decision made since September illegal and invalid. One of the Yemeni officials said that Egyptians will open an embassy in Aden in the coming days. The Saudi ambassador to Yemen said Friday: ""The security situation is calm in Aden and it's very difficult for us to resume our embassy operations in Sanaa."" Political negotiations came to an end on Friday after a majority of the political parties withdrew from the United Nations-led talk with the Houthis. ""Talks must take place where there is no militant threat,"" said AbdulAziz Jubari, the secretary-general of the Justice and Building party. Jamal Benomar, the U.N. envoy to Yemen, visited  Hadi in Aden on Wednesday and said in a statement that Hadi is still the constitutional president of Yemen. He stressed that Hadi must be part of the solution in Yemen and not be excluded. Benomar said that Hadi refused to currently be involved in the political talks unless they are moved from Sanaa. ""Hadi agrees that the Yemeni crisis must be solved solving through dialogue,"" Benomar said. The militants tightened their grip on power over the past month. Hadi resigned while still in Sanaa but rescinded after fleeing the capital. Houthis are Shiite Muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni Muslim country. They had been at war with the central government for more than a decade, but their entry into Sanaa in September brought things to a head, sparking battles that left than 300 people dead before a ceasefire was agreed to that month. Houthis then pressured Hadi to step down last month after he refused to agree to certain political demands.

"Moscow  (CNN)Crowds of people, some with tears in their eyes, flocked Saturday to the spot on a bridge in the shadow of the Kremlin where prominent opposition figure Boris Nemtsov was shot dead hours earlier, in what appeared to be a targeted killing. The fatal shooting of the former Russian deputy prime minister sparked outrage among fellow opposition figures, and many questions over who could be behind it. Nemtsov, who served in the late 1990s under President Boris Yeltsin, was one of President Vladimir Putin's most vocal critics. An ever-growing mound of flowers left by mourners marked the place where he fell late Friday night. The mood in the Russian capital is one of shock, among Putin supporters as well as those who back the opposition, one man told CNN. Investigators are combing through surveillance footage and questioning witnesses in the shooting, Russia's Investigative Committee said in a statement Saturday. ""There is no doubt that the crime was carefully planned,"" it said. ""It is obvious that the organizers and perpetrators of this crime were aware of the proposed route."" The weapon used appeared to be a Makarov pistol, it added. State-run Russia 24 reported that Nemtsov had received threats related to his stance on the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris, citing Investigative Committee spokesman Vladimir Markin. Meanwhile, Nemtsov's former press secretary and close friend Alexander Kotyusov told the official Tass news agency that Nemtsov would be buried in Moscow. Opposition activists told CNN they believed the funeral would be held Tuesday. Putin quickly condemned the killing and expressed his condolences to his family. He also ordered three law enforcement agencies to investigate the shooting, Tass reported. According to the Kremlin website, Putin has written to Nemtsov's mother saying he shared her grief and promising to bring those behind the killing to justice. ""He always openly and honestly stated his position, defended his point of view,"" he said of his erstwhile critic. Nemtsov was a top official with the Republican Party of Russia/Party of People's Freedom, a liberal opposition group. He had most recently been critical of the Kremlin's handling of the Ukraine crisis. Opposition leader Ilya Yashin said his friend had been working on a report about Russian troops and their involvement in Ukraine. In a statement released by the U.N. on Saturday, Secretary-General Ban ki-moon expressed his deepest condolences to Mr. Nemtsov's family, friends and supporters while affirming an investigation into Nemtsov's murder has been announced through which he ""expects the perpetrators to be brought to justice swiftly."" His death comes two days before a large opposition rally was set to take place in Moscow. Hours before his death Friday, Nemtsov had done a radio interview urging people to attend the rally Sunday. After his death, party leaders decided to instead hold a mourning march Sunday in downtown Moscow. Russian authorities have reversed their earlier decision not to issue a permit for the march and will now allow the procession Sunday afternoon, leader of the People's Freedom Party Mikhail Kasyanov said. The organizers of the march claim that so far some 1,200 people have confirmed they will join. Moscow police said they would tighten security for the march, with up to 50,000 participants allowed to take part. The route will lead just over a mile from Kitay Gorod in downtown Moscow to the bridge near the Kremlin where Nemtsov was killed. Nemtsov was walking with a companion, Anna Duritskaya, 23, at the time of the shooting. A political colleague and friend of Nemtsov's, Ilya Yashin, said Duritskaya called him and told him that just before midnight a car with ""several men"" pulled up and someone in the car then opened fire on Nemtsov. Investigators interviewed Duritskaya on details surrounding the shooting, she wasn't wounded. Russian broadcasters Life News and Russia 24 said the car used in the attack had been found in downtown Moscow and was being examined by police. Life News earlier posted video of what it said could be the vehicle, a white car captured by a CCTV camera near the bridge. Police have not commented on the video. The area in the center city is normally busy on a Friday night, though the weather was cold and wet. Putin said he suspected it was a contract hit meant to cause political discord, according to the President's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov. The leader of Russia's Communist Party, Gennady Zyuganov, told Tass the killing should be investigated fast to avoid it being exploited by Russia's enemies, potentially leading to ""far-reaching consequences."" He added that ""all Russia's foes will use this murder to the maximum."" A man like Nemtsov had many enemies, experts said. Nemtsov, 55, had been arrested several times for speaking against Putin's government. The most recent arrests were in 2011 when he protested the results of parliamentary elections and in 2012 when tens of thousands protested against Putin. In a restaurant interview with CNN's Anthony Bourdain last year, he lamented the situation for business owners. ""This is a country of corruption. And if you have business, you are in a very unsafe situation. Everybody can press you and destroy your business. That's it,"" Nemtsov said. Nemtsov was also a vocal critic of the 2014 Winter Olympics held in Sochi, calling them one of the most ""outrageous swindles"" in recent Russian history. World chess champion-turned opposition activist Garry Kasparov tweeted extensively about Nemtsov's death. ""When we argued, Boris would tell me I was too hasty, that in Russia you had to live a long time to see change. Now he'll never see it. RIP,"" he wrote in one. Nemtsov's lawyer Vadim Prokhorov told Russian media that Nemtsov's life had been threatened on social media in recent weeks. Critics like Yashin and Kasparov pointed fingers in the direction of Putin or a supporter of the Russian President. ""It's clearly a political murder. It's definitely a contract one,"" Yashin said. ""I don't know who killed Boris, but I know that it's the government and personally Putin who are responsible for it. They've been constantly promoting a hatred towards everyone who doesn't support their course and thinks different."" It's something even Nemtsov himself had said he had thought about, acknowledging in an interview with Russian newspaper Sobesednik this month that he was ""a little bit"" afraid his mother's fears Putin would have him killed would come true. But, he added, ""I'm not afraid of him that much.  If I was afraid I wouldn't be heading an opposition party and do what I'm doing."" Opinion: Nemtsov killing: A chilling historical parallel? Kasparov said the Russian President is to blame even if not directly involved. ""If Putin gave order to murder Boris Nemtsov is not the point. It is Putin's dictatorship. His 24/7 propaganda about enemies of the state,"" Kasparov tweeted. ""In Putin's atmosphere of hatred & violence, abroad & in Russia, bloodshed is the prerequisite to show loyalty, that you are on the team,"" he added. New footage released by a Moscow city government owned TV station, TVCenter, on Saturday aired low resolution surveillance video which the TV station claims captured two people they believe to be Boris Nemstov and his friend Anna Duritskaya, just seconds before the shooting. Critics of Putin have in the past suffered miserable fates. Last year, a Moscow court sentenced five men to prison for the 2006 killing of Russian journalist and fierce Kremlin critic Anna Politkovskaya. Business magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky accused Putin of corruption and wound up spending 10 years in prison and labor camps. Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko accused state security services of organizing a coup to put Putin in power. He was poisoned by a lethal dose of radioactive polonium and died in London in 2006. No killer has been caught. ""It's the latest in a series of high-profile killings of people who have been critics of authorities in Russia over the last few years,"" said Peter Baker, the author of ""Kremlin Rising"" and a New York Times reporter. ""We don't know yet, of course, who did this or why, but it will certainly send a terrible message to people who are fighting this cause Nemtsov has been fighting."" Michael McFaul, the former U.S. ambassador to Russia, described Nemtsov as a ""real patriot"" who had been his loyal friend for 20 years. ""I hope a real investigation will tell us who committed this heinous crime,"" he tweeted, pointing out that it happened only 100 meters from the heavily guarded Kremlin. ""You teach people to hate. You encourage people to hate. You push messages of hate. They then do hateful things."" U.S. President Barack Obama called for an impartial investigation and praised the deceased leader. ""Nemtsov was a tireless advocate for his country, seeking for his fellow Russian citizens the rights to which all people are entitled. I admired Nemtsov's courageous dedication to the struggle against corruption in Russia and appreciated his willingness to share his candid views with me when we met in Moscow in 2009,"" Obama said in a written statement from the White House. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said he was saddened by the death of Nemtsov, who ""committed his life to a more democratic, prosperous, open Russia, and to strong relationships between Russia and its neighbors and partners, including the United States."" Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said Saturday ""it is hard to believe"" that Nemtsov was killed. ""I have no doubt that the murderers will be brought to justice. Sooner or later. Rest in peace,"" Poroshenko said via Twitter. French President Francois Hollande condemned the murder of the man he described as ""a courageous and tireless defender of democracy and a fierce fighter against corruption."" Who was Boris Nemtsov? CNN's Frederik Pleitgen and Alla Eshchenko reported from Moscow and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.

Investigative Committee says killing of Nemtsov was ""carefully planned"""
"(CNN)The slaying of prominent Kremlin critic Boris Nemtsov in the heart of Moscow has shocked Russia and the wider world. His murder, two days before a planned opposition march, has also outraged fellow opposition figures and prompted a slew of speculation over who could be behind it. Some government critics pointed fingers in the direction of President Vladimir Putin or one of his supporters. State media reported Nemtsov had received threats linked to his stance on the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris. The Kremlin suggested Nemtsov may have been killed by enemies of Russia intent on creating political discord. The leader of Russia's Communist Party similarly blamed anti-Russian ""provocation,"" according to the official news agency Tass. So who was Boris Nemtsov? And how did he make so many enemies? Nemtsov, 55, was a top official with the Republican Party of Russia/Party of People's Freedom, a liberal opposition group. He had been arrested several times for speaking against Putin's government. The most recent arrests were in 2011 when he protested the results of parliamentary elections and in 2012 when tens of thousands protested against Putin. He had most recently been critical of the Kremlin's handling of the Ukraine crisis. Opposition leader Ilya Yashin said his friend had been working on a report about Russian troops and their involvement in Ukraine. In a blog entry, published on the website of radio station Echo of Moscow, Nemtsov wrote last weekend that the Kremlin now accused him of being behind the protests in Kiev's Maidan, or Independence Square, which led to the ouster of Ukraine's pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanokovych. He posted a picture from an ""anti-Maidan"" protest held in Moscow which showed a marcher holding a sign with his face under the words ""Maidan organizer."" ""The Kremlin has changed its concept,"" Nemtsov wrote. ""It used to say it's the State Department who organized the Maidan, and now they say it's me."" In a hard-hitting interview conducted only hours before his death with Newsweek magazine, Nemtsov said Russia was ""drowning"" under Putin's leadership and was swiftly becoming a fascist state. ""Due to the policy of Vladimir Putin, a country with unparalleled potential is sinking, an economy which accumulated untold currency reserves is collapsing,"" he said. ""This government wades into a costly, fratricidal war in Ukraine and into pointless confrontation with the West. We all feel the effects of this insane policy."" Nemtsov accused Putin of using ""Goebbels-style propaganda"" -- a reference to Nazi Germany's propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels -- to brainwash his fellow countrymen. One element of this was to implant them ""with a virus of inferiority complex towards the West, the belief that the only thing we can do to amaze the world is use force, violence and aggression,"" Nemtsov said. Putin has condemned Nemtsov's murder and ordered a swift investigation. The Kremlin has denied direct involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Nemtsov was also known for -- and may have made enemies from -- his anti-corruption stance. Early in his career, Nemtsov won praise for his efforts as governor of Nizhniy Novgorod, a large city and major economic hub. Nemtsov was also a vocal critic of the 2014 Winter Olympics held in Sochi, calling them one of the most ""outrageous swindles"" in recent Russian history. In a 2013 report, he questioned where $20 billion to $30 billion had gone, saying preparations for the Games had been characterized by ""embezzlement"" and ""unprecedented corruption."" In a restaurant interview with CNN's Anthony Bourdain last year, Nemtsov lamented the situation for business owners. ""This is a country of corruption. And if you have business, you are in a very unsafe situation. Everybody can press you and destroy your business. That's it,"" Nemtsov said. In the same interview, he did offer a hint of optimism. ""This is my country. The Russian people are in bit of trouble. Russian court doesn't work. Russian education decline every year. I believe that Russia has a chance to be free. Has a chance. It's difficult, but we must do it,"" he said. In a statement after his death, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Nemtsov had always worked toward a more democratic and prosperous Russia. ""In every post, he sought to reform and open Russia, and to empower the Russian people to have a greater say in the life of their country,"" he said. Years before he became a key opposition leader, Nemtsov served as deputy Prime Minister under former President Boris Yeltsin, the first post-Soviet President. Back in the 1990s, he was a high-flier bound for greater things. But he lost out in the struggle to succeed Yeltsin and had been marginalized since Putin was elected, said Peter Baker, author of ""Kremlin Rising"" and a New York Times reporter. ""He was a person who had been fierce in his criticism of Putin. He'd clearly gotten under Putin's skin on a number of occasions. A number of people had become his enemies,"" Baker said. Baker said Nemtsov tried to work with Putin's regime at first but soon switched to the opposition. ""History will remember him as someone who took chances, who risked his life literally to speak out in a country where speaking out is not encouraged, to say the least,"" Baker said. Opinion: Nemtsov killing: A chilling historical parallel? Nemtsov was a man who impressed many who met him with his energy and passion for his homeland. Sir Andrew Wood, a former UK ambassador to Russia, told CNN that Nemtsov, whom he knew personally in the 1990s, was a ""genuine Russian patriot"" who opposed what the Kremlin had come to stand for. ""He was enthusiastic, he was engaging, I think he was always true to his beliefs, he didn't take himself over-seriously, but he did his best to promote liberal reform then, and he had been before a very successful mayor of one of the central towns, Nizhniy Novgorod."" Former U.S. Ambassador Michael McFaul paid tribute to Nemtsov ""as a real patriot, who believed in the possibility of Russia's greatness"" and said he wept for both Nemtsov's family and the country he loved. ""Politics aside, he was always a loyal, loving friend of mine for 20 years. We all will miss him dearly,"" he said. Putin, in a telegram to Nemtsov's mother Dina Eydman, also paid tribute to Nemtsov's integrity. ""Boris Nemtsov, left his mark on the history of Russia, in politics and public life. He worked on important positions in the difficult transition period for our country. He always openly and honestly stated his position, defended his point of view,"" he said. Putin vowed that her son's killers would be ""properly punished."" Nemtsov's death has shocked Russia, but it may not have come as a total surprise. Nemtsov acknowledged in an interview with Russian newspaper Sobesednik this month that he was ""a little bit"" afraid that his mother's fear -- that Putin would have him killed -- would come true. But, he added, ""I'm not afraid of him that much. If I was afraid I wouldn't be heading an opposition party and do what I'm doing."" Nemtsov's lawyer Vadim Prokhorov told Russian media that Nemtsov's life had been threatened on social media in recent weeks. But he didn't walk around with bodyguards, noted Julia Ioffe, a contributing writer to The New York Times Magazine who has covered Russian politics extensively. ""It was a very overt message of bravery,"" Ioffe told CNN's ""AC360."" ""What we've seen in return is a very overt message of fear. People in the opposition will not believe anything that comes out of the Kremlin in terms of who did this. They perceive this as a message directly sent to them. When you see Boris Nemtsov's body lying with the Kremlin as a backdrop, they understand that's a message directed to them."" In his final Newsweek interview, Nemtsov spoke of the need for ""an alternative vision, a different idea of Russia. Our idea is the one of a democratic and open Russia. A country which is not applying bandit methods to its own citizens and neighbors."" Crowds mourn Boris Nemtsov .

"(CNN)Six suspects linked to terrorist activity referred to Syria and Iraq as ""the beach,"" and used other coded language to avoid detection in the United States, authorities say. The Bosnian immigrants, including a husband and a wife, were arrested this month in Illinois and St. Louis, according to court records released Friday. Three of the suspects are naturalized American citizens. A federal indictment alleges they communicated via social media and conspired to send money and military equipment to terrorists in Syria and Iraq. They allegedly shipped firearms accessories, military uniforms and  combat boots through intermediaries in Turkey. Suspects named in the indictment are Nihad Rosic,  Armin Harcevic, and married couple Ramiz and Sedina Hodzic, all from St. Louis, along with Illinois residents Mediha  Salkicevic and Jasminka Ramic. They face various charges, including conspiracy to kill, and sending money and weapons to terrorists, the indictment shows. Also named in the indictment is Abdullah Ramo Pazara, who allegedly traveled to Syria and Iraq to support terrorists. To support Pazara, the suspects sought out backers in the U.S. and used the money to purchase military supplies, which they sent to him, the indictment said. They used coded words and nicknames on social media to avoid detection, referring to each other with titles such as ""lions or Bosnian brothers,""  the indictment alleges. Pazara traveled to Syria in July 2013, and allegedly started receiving money from the defendants within a month.  Shipments of military equipment soon followed, according to the indictment. Federal prosecutors indicted the six suspects this month in St. Louis County. Information on their attorneys was not immediately available.","The six suspects include a husband and wife .

"Police know who shot Michael Brown, but three days after the 18-year-old's death, they're still not saying. Releasing the name of the officer who shot and killed the teen in Ferguson, Missouri, isn't as important, they say, as protecting the community and the person who pulled the trigger. Police Chief Thomas Jackson told CNN his department decided against releasing the officer's name Monday after social media and phone threats targeted another officer who was falsely named as the shooter. ""We started getting death threats against him and his family, and although that's not most of the people, we took these things seriously,"" Jackson said. ""We think that they're credible threats ... Right now the safety factor far outweighs the benefit from releasing the name, which is minimal."" Lawyers representing Brown's family blasted the decision, suggesting authorities were protecting one of their own rather than following standard procedures. ""That doesn't give the community confidence. That doesn't make it transparent,"" attorney Benjamin Crump told reporters. ""And remember, we've got a long way to go before this community starts to believe that the police are going to give them all the answers and not try to sweep it under the rug."" Police should have released the officer's name 72 hours after the shooting, he said. If police are going to ask residents of Ferguson to obey the law, he said, ""then it's got to work both ways."" Jackson said his office doesn't know yet when it will release the name, but it isn't skirting any laws. ""The prosecuting attorney and the St. Louis County police chief agree that this is the prudent step to take under the circumstances,"" he said. Witness: I haven't spoken with police . Exactly what led up to Brown's death Saturday is a point of major contention. Witnesses say the African-American teen was unarmed and his hands were in the air demonstrating that. Police have said that Brown attacked the officer in his car and tried to take his gun. As federal civil rights investigators and the FBI carry out their own inquiry into the controversial case, tensions are running high in the town of 21,000 -- where there's a history of distrust between the predominately black community and the largely white police force. Dorian Johnson, who said he saw the shooting, told CNN Tuesday that the officer who opened fire is white. Johnson said he was walking with Brown in the street when the confrontation erupted. But police didn't speak to him about the shooting that day -- and still haven't, Johnson said, adding that the officer seemed stunned afterward. ""It's almost like he wasn't paying attention to me anymore. It's like he was in shock himself, and his vision wasn't on anything but my friend Big Mike,"" he said. Johnson's attorney told CNN that police reached out to him on Tuesday to set up an interview, but they haven't had a chance to talk yet. Amid protests, calls for calm . The promise of investigations by local and federal authorities hasn't stemmed outrage in the community. A vigil for the teen devolved into violent clashes with police Sunday as some looted stores. On Monday night, there was chaos again on the streets. Shots were fired, authorities said, and police used tear gas to disperse a crowd. At a press conference with other African-American leaders Tuesday, the Rev. Al Sharpton urged people in Ferguson not to ""betray the gentle giant"" that Brown was by allowing their anger over his killing to lead to violence. ""Don't be a traitor to Michael Brown in the name of 'you mad,' "" Sharpton said, reminding the crowd that Brown's parents are planning a funeral for their son, whom they had expected to head to college this week. Michael Brown Sr., the teen's father, renewed calls for people to steer clear of violence. ""I need all of us to come together and do this right, the right way, so we can get something done about this,"" he said. U.S. President Barack Obama echoed calls for calm, releasing a statement expressing condolences to the teen's family and describing his death as heartbreaking. ""I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions. But as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,"" Obama said. ""We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds."" A town in turmoil -- 5 things about Ferguson, Missouri . College-bound teen sought a better life . Brown was going to defy negative stereotypes, staying away from the street life that plagued many African-American young men by instead going to college, his mother said. ""People may do things and it becomes repetitive in a certain race, but we didn't. We don't live like that. Not our family,"" his mother, Lesley McSpadden, told CNN. ""We feel like we can do anything and go anywhere. ... Just because my son is a 6'4"" black male walking down a city street does not mean he fit the profile for anything other than just walking down the street."" About 63% of Ferguson's residents over age 16 are African-American. Three of the police department's 53 officers -- just over 5% -- are African-American, Jackson said, adding that he's pushed to improve diversity. Racial profiling is ""strictly forbidden,"" he said. ""Racial profiling is against our policies,"" he said. ""It actually benefits nothing."" Speaking at a community forum scheduled in the aftermath of the shooting, Jackson said the situation ""has been a tragedy for the city and the country."" ""It breaks my heart some think I'm part of the problem,"" he said Tuesday night. The police chief promised the crowd he would be part of the solution. Teen was two days away from starting college .

"(CNN)Juan Martin Del Potro has pulled out of the Australian Open, citing persistent concerns surrounding a wrist injury that has ravaged much of his past year.

Yet it appeared that Del Potro's injury jinx was behind him after reaching the quarter final of the Sydney International last week. But the former world number four decided that the year's first grand slam had come too soon.

""I appreciate the support that I received since I announced I was playing in Sydney,"" he added. ""It was amazing."" This year's Australian Open has been hit by a series of exciting, big --hitting players either pulling out injured or struggling to reach peak fitness before the tournament begins Monday. US Open champion Marin Cilic pulled out at the start of the year, as did Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga whilst Rafael Nadal has complained that he is still feeling the effects of an operation to remove his appendix. The biggest uncertainly, however, concerns the fitness of Australia's Nick Kyrgios. The teenage sensation arrived at Wimbledon an unknown but reached the quarter final after beating Nadal, announcing himself as one of the game's most exciting young talents. Kyrgios has been desperate to get fit for his first 'home' grand slam since following his breakthrough season and had taken the past four months off to try and heal a persistent back injury that had cast doubt on his participation. Last week it looked like he too might pull out but the 19-year-old confirmed he will be in Melbourne Monday. ""I'm obviously feeling it. It's not 100 per cent.

"(CNN)Arsenal put a huge dent in Manchester City's title hopes after a comfortable 2-0 victory at the Etihad Stadium. A first half penalty from Santi Cazorla and a second half Olivier Giroud header secured all three points for the North London club, reigniting their Champions League ambitions whilst leaving second place Manchester City five points adrift of Chelsea. Arsenal have had a terrible record against top four opposition away from home in recent years, and little was expected of a team ravaged by defensive injuries. Last season Manchester City won the corresponding fixture 6-3. Instead, Arsenal put in a supremely disciplined performance against a Manchester City team without their talismanic midfielder Yaya Toure, who is now at the African Cup of Nations, and struggling to score goals. Although striker Sergio Aguero started, he looked rusty and rarely threatened Colombia World Cup goalkeeper David Ospina in the Arsenal goal. It took a soft penalty to open the scoring, when Manchester City's captain Vincent Kompany was judged to have impeded Nacho Monreal as he marauded into the box. Santi Cazorla, by far the best player on the pitch, dispatched the penalty despite Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart guessing the right way. ""The penalty changed the game,"" Manchester City coach Manuel Pellegrini told Sky Sports after the game, hinting that he believed Monreal deceived the referee. ""It was not a penalty,"" he added. Manchester City didn't look like equalizing and it wasn't a surprise when Olivier Giroud doubled the lead with a header early in the second half, converting from a Cazorla free kick. ""We played high up in their half and it worked because we knew we wanted to make the space tight and we did it well,"" Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger said after the game. ""People are very quick to judge and you forget we have many defenders out. It was down to discipline. We have a very important fight in front of us."" The victory lifted Arsenal into fifth place, one point behind Manchester United. Manchester City, however, are now five points behind leader's Chelsea. The two meet at Stamford Bridge in a fortnight. Meanwhile, in Sunday's other English Premier League game, West Ham United continued their brilliant start to the season by swatting aside relegation threatened Hull City. Second half goals from Andy Carroll, Morgan Amalfitano and Stewart Downing kept up their outside shot at Champions League qualification.","Arsenal beat Manchester City 2-0.

"There's no greater feeling of pre-drink excitement than hitting upon a secret den of cocktails, bonhomie and hedonism. Heading beneath the surface into the bowels of a building adds a certain frisson to a bar experience. Not only does a total lack of sunlight give one the excuse to stay until close to breakfast time, many of these subterranean bars have had bizarre former lives as nuclear bunkers and bank vaults. Now, sensibly, they're devoted to the joys of imbibing. Converted bank vault (Trinity Place, New York) Deep underneath a typically Gotham City-esque Big Apple skyscraper in the heart of the financial district, gaining entrance to Trinity Place involves walking through a set of two century-old 35-ton doors, which lead to the former vaults of the United States Realty Bank. The first room contains a buzzy lounge area and behind the second, a dining room which, according to owner Jason O'Brian, was once the private meeting room for the bank's executive board members.

Down two spiral staircases you're in Bunkr Parukarka, a nuclear bunker built by the Czech Communist party in the 1950s. ""It would have been easier to destroy it and then rebuild it from scratch,"" says Michal Tesinsky, the man behind the three-year clean up job that turned this Cold war oddity into a thriving club, art gallery, bar and live music venue that can hold 250 Prague night owls. Spookily however, over four fifths of the bunker complex still lies empty. Stranger still is the fact that one of the stipulations of the use of this incredible space is that, should Armageddon break out, the club must be converted back to its original purpose within 48 hours. Parukarka, Prague, +420 603 423 140 . Former brothel (Madame Claude, Berlin) This subterranean dive was once home to Berlin's notorious ladies of the night, who used this club to ""serve"" American soldiers in the period after World War II when the German capital was divided into zones controlled separately by the British, Americans, French and Russians. Converted by three French school friends who all moved to the German capital, the bar is now a warren of rooms with Dali-esque touches of surrealism including an upside down room where tables and lamps hang from the ceiling, a wardrobe leading into a secret bar and a delightfully low admission fee on a ""donate what you can afford"" basis. Entertainment veers towards the experimental and avant garde with regular DJ sets, open mic spoken word nights and even ping-pong contests. Madame Claude, 19 Lubbener Street, Berlin; +49 30 8411 0859 . Former Crypt (Bedfords, Norwich, UK) With its stone flagged floor and barrel vaulted ceiling, this bar and live music venue still bears the hallmarks of the 15th-century medieval crypt it once was. Located in The Lanes, one of the most ancient parts of the historic market city of Norwich, the building upstairs is no spring chicken, constructed in the 17th century and formerly used as a Post Office. Manager Jamie Jamieson, who has worked at Bedfords for 19 years says: ""It's a beautiful space with lots of exposed original features. Every time I show people round they say 'wow.' It has all the old stonework and a vaulted ceiling."" Listed as an ancient monument, the crypt was once used as a creche for the children of the office workers in the main building -- enough to give any child nightmares. Bombings during WWII meant that many of Norwich's crypts collapsed or were filled with rubble. This is one of the few survivors, where you can find anything from a DJ night to a salsa dance class -- and even the odd wedding after-party.

"(CNN) -- Her passion for public speaking and networking have earned Julia Hobsbawm the moniker ""queen of networking"" and made her one of the most influential people in the UK. As the founder of knowledge networking business Editorial Intelligence she aims to create more face-to-face meetings and live debates in a digital age where many opinion-formers are far too isolated in their corporate silos. To that end, Hobsbawm founded the Names Not Numbers ideas festival in 2009 to connect people from ""different walks of life -- business, culture, media, politics, academia, with each other in a very intensive setting."" CNN's Route to the Top caught up with Hobsbawm to talk about the brainstorming retreat she's created, the rising popularity of ideas conferences and the importance of intellectual stimulation. An edited version of the interview follows. CNN: What is Names Not Numbers? Julia Hobsbawm: It's a mini-festival about ideas -- that's the best way I can describe it. Each year, 150 to 200 participants from diverse backgrounds such as business, politics, law, or arts set off on a three days long journey to talk about the things that really matter. What makes it attractive to people is that in this environment where everything is busy and rushed, actually slowing down is a counter-intuitively refreshing and rewarding thing to do. CNN: Is your conference aimed at connecting mind, body and soul? JH: It seems that something happens physically and chemically when you go for a journey. When people relax, they give more of themselves. Rather than just dropping out of the office for an hour and then rushing back, you are with a small family of people for a period of time. All sorts of ideas begin to exchange really fruitfully, friendships and business developments form. What people really want is to be looked after, as if they were going to a sort of ""ideas holiday."" CNN: Why do you think that events like this proved so popular over the past decade? JH: The ""ideas conference"" is still relatively young -- the TED conferences celebrate their 30th anniversary this year; Names Not Numbers is seven years old. I think it is no accident that we see more public and private festivals in the decade that'd seen Facebook. So, as a knowledge networking company, we explore how people crave a face-to-face connection in a Facebook age. Whilst technology enables everybody to connect, what actually moves the dial on relationships and connections is that when you speak to someone, you look in their face, you take a read of their body language. I think this is why the intensity and the immediacy of an elongated conference work so well. CNN: Names Not numbers has been described as an ""intellectual Viagra."" What does that mean to you? JH: In a working world, we sometimes forget that people like to be intellectually stimulated. Many don't often get the opportunity in their day jobs to use all the bits of their brain and their emotions. We hope we allow that to come out a bit. CNN: Do you think that idea conferences may pose a risk of over-stimulation in today's information age? JH: I think the age of overload is a real risk for people. And one of the benefits of coming away for two or three days of content that other people put together for you is that it actually allows you to relax. You don't have to fervently read and go online, screen a million emails and worry about what you've missed. So, in a curious way, actually having a very rich, immersive period of time is reassuring -- the programming has been done for you. READ THIS: Career tips from leading bosses .

"Pasco, Washington (CNN)A proud laborer from Mexico, Antonio Zambrano-Montes picked fruit in the orchards of Washington state, but when his most valuable tools -- his hands -- became injured last year. he fell into deep despair. He couldn't work or send money to family in Mexico, two routines that shaped his life. It was this misfortune that distressed Zambrano-Montes in the days before he and police in the town of Pasco clashed in February, in a confrontation that ended with officers firing a total of 17 bullets, hitting Zambrano-Montes several times and killing him. He was unarmed but was accused of pelting police with rocks. His killing is now cited by family and Latino activists as another national example of officers using excessive lethal force against unarmed men, often minority men. The police shooting of Zambrano-Montes, 35, now haunts his family, due in no small measure to how the hail of police bullets was captured on videos and posted on YouTube by bystanders. ""Toño,"" as loved ones called him, was one of 16 children, and he migrated to the United States about 10 years ago to join other relatives and harvest food on farms, said his mother, Agapita Montes. That police fired 17 bullets at one of her 16 children leaves the mother aghast, she said. ""My son was a happy person, a hard worker and he got along with his siblings,"" the mother said last week in an interview with CNN en Espanol shortly after a funeral service for her son at Pasco's Saint Patrick Catholic Church. ""I had not seen him in 10 years, but I would talk to him over the phone,"" said the mother, who traveled to Pasco from her rural home in the central Mexican state of Michoacán for her son's funeral. ""I felt good that he was here. He was happy, and as a mother that was good for me,"" she said. It was at a funeral home where the 60-year-old Montes saw her son for the first time in a decade. More precisely, what she saw was his body. She almost fainted. ""Imagine so many years without seeing him and to come and see him in this situation. For a mother, it's heartbreaking, something you never hope for or want to happen to your children,"" Montes said. The video of officers gunning down Zambrano-Montes keeps playing over and over in the minds of the family. The tape shows Zambrano running across a street with police in pursuit before he was fatally shot. Police have said that Zambrano-Montes was throwing rocks at cars and trucks when confronted by police. He then allegedly stoned two officers, and police resorted to deadly force, authorities said. Officers had used a Taser on him, but it wasn't effective, police said. From what the mother has seen of the video, she noticed her son isn't shown throwing rocks. ""I don't see him throwing rocks. The only thing I can see is that he's running, he raises his hands and they still shoot him. Why? I ask myself. Why?""  Montes said. ""And when he falls, they still handcuff him, and that is what hurts me the most."" Zambrano-Montes' family said his limited English left him unable to understand the officers' commands, shouted in English. More than half of Pasco's 68,000 residents are Latino. Of the 71 sworn officers in the police department, 12 are certified as fluent in Spanish, a spokesman said. Montes now wants justice for her son. ""I ask for justice to be done because it's not right what they did to my son,"" Montes said. Erlinda Zambrano, an aunt of Zambrano-Montes, also found it very difficult to accept the police version of events, she said. ""We are living with profound pain from how he died, and it's something very bad and terrible,"" the aunt said. ""I look at the videos now and I cannot sleep because it's too hard."" The police killing of Zambrano-Montes has left the family grief-stricken and torn apart. In fact, a rift has developed between his mother's family and his former wife, Teresa De Jesus Meraz Ruiz, 32, who's also mother to his two young daughters. Each side commissioned a separate autopsy on Zambrano-Montes' body. The mother and the former wife haven't spoken to one another for years. In fact, Zambrano-Montes and the former wife had been separated for many years, according to the mother and the former wife's attorney. In all, the case involves three autopsies, including the one conducted by authorities. In a surprising revelation this past week, one of the autopsies appeared to conflict with the official account. The autopsy commissioned by Meraz Ruiz and her attorney appeared to show that Zambrano-Montes had bullet wounds to the buttocks and the back of the arm. That is at odds with what authorities said a day earlier, when Kennewick Police Sgt. Ken Lattin told reporters, ""We do know this from the preliminary autopsy report, there were no shots in the back."" Kennewick police belong to a team of local law agencies, called the Tri-City Special Investigative Unit, that is conducting an independent investigation of the police shooting of Zambrano-Montes in Pasco. Franklin County Prosecuting Attorney Shawn P. Sant declined to comment this week on how the conflict between the two autopsies. Sant was shown a copy of a body diagram in the second autopsy, conducted by the former wife's side, he said. ""Our office is waiting for complete reports from both pathologists before making any conclusions,"" Sant said in a statement. ""There are several questions that will be answered in the final pathology reports including number of gunshot wounds, number of bullets recovered, bullet trajectories, etc.,"" Sant said. Ultimately, an inquest jury will ""decide what information is significant to the cause and manner of death and whether anyone is criminally liable for Mr. Zambrano's death,"" Sant said. Zambrano-Montes's mother said her son married Meraz Ruiz in a church ceremony in Mexico more than 10 years ago, but the marriage wasn't officially registered with civil records. Meraz Ruiz couldn't be reached for comment, but her attorney, Charles Herrmann, acknowledged his client's church marriage in Mexico and asserted that Meraz Ruiz is the legal wife and widow of Zambrano-Montes. The couple had been separated for ""quite some time,"" and Meraz Ruiz and the couple's two daughters now live in California, Herrmann said. Meanwhile, Ruiz and her two children this week withdrew a $25 million claim against the city of Pasco alleging that officers killed Zambrano-Montes ""execution style,"" Herrmann said. Herrmann said his client wants to do more research and investigation into the shooting. The former wife plans to file a renewed claim at a later date, Herrmann said. For her part, Zambrano-Montes' mother has hired attorney Benjamin Crump, who has represented the families of Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin, both young African-American men whose deaths caused national protests. Brown, 19, was unarmed when he was fatally shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri; the officer was cleared of criminal wrongdoing. Martin, 17, was also unarmed when he was fatally shot in a physical confrontation in Florida with former neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman, who was later acquitted of a murder charge by a jury. Meanwhile, the Mexican consul in Seattle, Eduardo Baca, has written a letter to Pasco Police Chief Robert Metzger expressing ""deep concern over the unwarranted use of lethal force against an unarmed Mexican national by police officers."" Zambrano-Montes' mother and family have asked U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to conduct ""a full, fair and complete investigation"" into the killing, according to a Friday letter provided by the mother's attorney. The U.S. Justice Department office in Seattle is monitoring the case, a spokesman said. Also, the FBI in Seattle ""is monitoring the investigation of this use of force, conducted by the Tri-City Special Investigative Unit,"" FBI spokeswoman Ayn Dietrich-Williams in Seattle said. Meanwhile, Latino community leaders in Pasco met Wednesday with the U.S. attorney for Eastern Washington, Michael Ormsby, and Assistant U.S. Attorney A. Aine Ahmed, according to the group Consejo Latino. The meeting lasted two and a half hours, the group said. That organization is advancing a community demand for a U.S. Department of Justice inquiry into Zambrano-Montes' killing because of ""widely-held community beliefs that the local police investigation of the police shooting was perceived as a conflict of interest and was lacking in credibility and impartiality,"" Consejo Latino said. According to the group, the federal prosecutor's office will provide remedies and suggestions to Pasco police on their practices and procedures. For now, Zambrano-Montes' mother has taken control over her son's body, which she plans to send to Mexico for burial on a little ranch called Pomaro in the Michoacán municipality of Aquila, she said. The former wife isn't contesting the mother's control over Zambrano-Montes' body, said Herrmann, attorney for the former wife. The plot is near where the mother and her family live, in the mountains far from people. In fact, they must walk a good distance just to go shopping, Montes said. His burial has been delayed because the mother commissioned an autopsy on her son in Florida, conducted this past week, and she has ordered more tests on his remains. His grave will mark the end to a long journey. He came to the United States looking for his own American dream, Zambrano-Montes's family said. But he left the world through what his family says is a continuing nightmare. CNN en Espanol's Jaqueline Hurtado reported from Pasco. CNN's Michael Martinez wrote and reported from Los Angeles.","Antonio Zambrano-Montes, 35, picked fruit in Washington state's orchards until he injured his hands .

"Angelina Jolie, 36, and Brad Pitt, 48, a Hollywood megastar couple since 2005, are engaged, Pitt's representative said Friday. ""Yes, it's confirmed. It is a promise for the future, and their kids are very happy. There's no date set at this time. Brad designed the ring,"" the representative, Cynthia Pett-Dante, told CNN. The longtime couple had been insisting that they wouldn't marry unless the nation's laws allowed all couples to marry. Asked about this position after the engagement announcement, Pitt's representative didn't have an immediate comment. Jewelry designer Robert Procop of Beverly Hills, California, designed the diamond engagement ring after a yearlong collaboration with Pitt, his representative said. Pitt ""wanted every aspect of it to be perfect, so Robert was able to locate a diamond of the finest quality and cut it to an exact custom size and shape to suit Angelina's hand,"" the representative said. ""Brad was always heavily involved, overseeing every aspect of the creative design evolution. The side diamonds are specially cut to encircle her finger."" The couple has six children, including three biological children together. Pitt adopted two of Jolie's children whom she had earlier adopted from Cambodia and Ethiopia, and they together adopted a boy from Vietnam. Their biological children include twins. Jolie, the daughter of actor Jon Voight and actress Marcheline Bertrand, won an Oscar for her role as a mental patient in the 1999 film ""Girl, Interrupted."" Pitt, who grew up in Springfield, Missouri, was nominated for an Oscar and won a Golden Globe for his role in the 1995 science fiction film ""Twelve Monkeys."" Jolie was previously married to actor Jonny Lee Miller and actor Billy Bob Thornton. Pitt earlier had been married to actress Jennifer Aniston. The couple has used their international celebrity to draw attention to a number of humanitarian causes. Despite ongoing reports that Jolie and Pitt began their love affair during the making of 2005's ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" -- while Pitt was still married to Aniston -- Jolie insisted to the UK's Stylist magazine in 2010 that their relationship began after the film.

"Chinese authorities formally arrested prominent lawyer Pu Zhiqiang on Friday for ""picking quarrels and creating a disturbance."" His other alleged crime was ""illegally obtaining citizens' personal information,"" Beijing police said on their official microblog, adding that the investigation into Pu is still ongoing. Pu, 49, was detained in early May after attending a low-key seminar in a private home to mark the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. State-run Global Times newspaper said in an editorial at the time that he had crossed ""a legal red line"" by associating himself with a topic still considered taboo in China. Pu took part in the student-led demonstrations in 1989 that ended in a bloody military crackdown on June 4 of that year. He later become one of the best-known lawyers in China for defending human rights in courts as well as in the media. A fierce critic of China's once ubiquitous forced labor camps, Pu took on several high-profile clients who were victims of the ""re-education through labor"" system. His cases gained nationwide attention and support, pressuring the government to re-examine the controversial system and leading to its eventual abolition late last year. Although his work had often put him at odds with the ruling Communist Party, Pu dismissed the risks in an interview with CNN last summer. ""I think I'm fine,"" he said. ""I'm a moderate, and the government has treated me well. I'm a veteran lawyer and haven't made mistakes in my career. I'm not radical, and I don't threaten the government."" Pu's arrest comes as the latest development in a new wave of government crackdowns on human rights advocates. Police put nearly 100 people in detention or under house arrest before this year's Tiananmen anniversary, said Chinese Human Rights Defenders, a Washington-based monitoring group. When President Xi Jinping took office in 2013, some activists hoped he would preside over a system more tolerant of dissent and discussion. His government, however, is now widely seen as tightening the screws on the work of activists and intellectuals, including the sentencing of Xu Zhiyong, another well-known human rights lawyer, to four years in prison in January after he pushed for financial transparency for senior officials.","The government accuses Pu Zhiqiang of ""picking quarrels and creating a disturbance""

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Almost 30 years ago, when Wayne Williams went on trial in two deaths that became known as the Atlanta child murders, DNA testing was not yet a staple of courtroom science. Now it is. And new results have implicated Williams in the death of at least one 11-year-old victim. When Patrick Baltazar's body was found dumped down a wooded slope behind an office park on February 13, 1981, a forensic scientist discovered two human scalp hairs inside the boy's shirt.  Watch more about Patrick's tragic story . At trial, scientists from both the FBI and Royal Canadian Mounted Police would testify that, under a microscope, the hairs were consistent with those of Wayne Williams. But that was only a matter of judgment, not exact science.  In 2007, defense lawyers for Williams raised the question of DNA testing on dog hairs which were on bodies of many of the 27 boys and young men found dead during the two-year murder spree. At the same time, the judge decided to allow those two hairs found on Baltazar to be sent to the FBI's DNA laboratory at Quantico, Virginia. The laboratory report found the scalp hairs had the same type of DNA sequence as did Wayne Williams' own hair. ""I don't think they said it was a match,"" Williams told CNN. ""I think they said [they] could not rule out whoever the hairs were from as being the possible donor."" But retired FBI scientist Harold Deadman, who testified about the hair findings in Williams' 1982 trial and later became head of the FBI's DNA lab, said it was the strongest finding possible with this particular type of testing. ""It would probably exclude 98 percent or so of the people in the world,"" Deadman said. Of 1,148 African-American hair samples in the FBI's data base, the FBI said only 29 had the same sequence -- in other words, only 2½ of every 100 African-Americans. None of the Caucasian or Hispanic hair samples in the data base had this sequence. When those samples are added in the total, then the odds rise to almost 130-to-1 against the hairs coming from any person other than Wayne Williams. The FBI report said this: ""Wayne Williams cannot be excluded as the source of the hair."" The finding is not ironclad. Because the hairs were incomplete, the type of testing, called mitochondrial DNA, can trace only the maternal line. Only with nucleic DNA testing, which includes paternal lineage, could the results be absolutely conclusive.  When CNN showed the DNA results to victim Baltazar's stepmother, Sheila Baltazar, she said, ""Without a shadow of a doubt, I really in my heart believe Wayne Williams killed Patrick Baltazar.""  Williams not only has denied he killed Patrick Baltazar, but has said he never met the boy. Yet testimony at trial established various fibers found on the Baltazar clothing could be traced to a bedroom carpet in Wayne Williams' home, his bedspread, a yellow blanket found under that bed, a leather jacket hanging in Wayne's closet, and a gray glove in his station wagon. See a map that tracks victims' bodies . There were also dog hairs on the Baltazar body which prosecution witnesses testified probably came from the Williams family's German Shepherd, ""Sheba."" When those dog hairs were sent to a genetics laboratory in the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of California, Davis, in 2007, the report said Sheba had the same DNA sequence. It said that DNA chain would be found in only 1 out of 100 dogs. The Baltazar case was included among 10 other deaths presented to the jury in Wayne Williams trial, although he was not charged in any of those, and was convicted of murdering two adults whose bodies were found in an Atlanta river in the spring of 1981. iReport: Do you remember the Atlanta child murders? Scientists considered the hair and fiber evidence in the Baltazar murder to be among the strongest of their cases. However, the trial took place in the courts of Fulton County, which includes the largest part of Atlanta. Baltazar's body had been found just over the line in the DeKalb County portion of Atlanta, and trying to include his death among the Fulton County charges would have raised legal issues.","Patrick Baltazar, 11, was found dead in '81 with scalp hairs in his shirt .
New DNA test: High likelihood that hairs on Baltazar were from Wayne Williams .

"(CNN) -- The surprise decision to award U.S. President Barack Obama the Nobel Peace Prize elicited swift reaction Friday, with some hailing the choice and others expressing astonishment and skepticism. Chairman of the Nobel peace prize committee Thorbjoen Jagland holds a picture of the 2009 winner. Praise came from Afghanistan's president, the Israeli defense minister and even a senior official from Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that controls Gaza. Yet an Egyptian human rights activist said he was ""shocked"" that Obama won. And the Internet hummed with a range of views. Afghan President Hamid Karzai -- whose U.S.-backed government is locked in warfare with Islamic militants -- praised the choice. ""We congratulate, wholeheartedly, President Obama on the award of this prestigious award,"" said Karzai, who commended Obama's ""vision and leadership."" Yet Hisham Qasim, Egyptian democracy and human rights activist, said he was ""shocked"" Obama won. ""He has achieved nothing. He's stumbling. He hasn't achieved any of his promises and nothing is working. He promised to close Guantanamo and now that's not going to happen, and the Arab-Israeli conflict looks like it's going to get very nasty."" The Norwegian Nobel Committee said it gave the prize to Obama for his ""efforts to strengthen international diplomacy,"" his ""vision of and work for a world without nuclear weapons"" and for inspiring hope and creating ""a new climate in international politics.""  Why Obama? Nobel committee chairman explains » . Many questioned what Obama had accomplished to deserve the award. Gideon Rachman, a foreign affairs columnist for The Financial Times, wrote an online blog under the headline ""What did Obama do to win the Nobel Peace Prize?"" ""I am a genuine admirer of Obama. And I am very pleased that George W. Bush is no longer president. But I doubt that I am alone in wondering whether this award is slightly premature. It is hard to point to a single place where Obama's efforts have actually brought about peace -- Gaza, Iran, Sri Lanka?  Watch the reaction from across Europe » . ""While it is OK to give school children prizes for 'effort' -- my kids get them all the time -- I think international statesmen should probably be held to a higher standard,"" he wrote. Obama has sought to make peace between Israel and the Palestinians, and officials from the Israeli government and Hamas sent congratulations and hope that the choice will help pave diplomatic ground. Watch more about the Mideast reaction » . Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said he believes the prize ""will strengthen President Barack Obama's capability to contribute to regional peace in the Middle East, and to an agreement between us and the Palestinians that will bring security, growth and prosperity to all the nations in the region."" Hamas official Ahmed Yousef also congratulated Obama, ""though it is early for him to be awarded this prize."" Yousef noted that in a June 4 speech in Cairo, Obama ""reached out to the Muslim world ... and said many of the right things."" Obama, Yousef said, ""is a man who thinks of achieving world peace"" Yousef said he believes Obama represents a ""new era in American politics,"" but thinks ""the president has done nothing to push forward peace between Israeli and Palestinians"" even though the ""intention is there ... it is an uphill battle with the Jewish lobby and Congress."" ""We know he is somebody different from past leaders who supported Israel economically and militarily,"" Yousef said. The Internet was alive with commentary from journalists, political leaders and others. The winner of 1983's Nobel Peace Prize, anti-communist Polish leader Lech Walesa, was quoted in The Wall Street Journal as expressing surprise. ""Who, Obama? So fast? Too fast -- he hasn't had the time to do anything yet,"" the paper's Web site quoted Walesa as saying. One person expressed ""sheer disbelief"" that Obama had won, in a Twitter posting, saying the prize should have gone to a person such as Zimbabwe's Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai because ""he stood up to a murderous dictator."" Another person said she ""seriously cannot believe they gave Obama the Nobel Peace Prize. Ridiculous."" Others had praise. One person wrote: ""My president Just won the Nobel peace prize!!!! Go prez Obama."" Former Nobel peace laureates weighed in. Kofi Annan, the former U.N. secretary general who won the peace prize in 2001, called the choice ""unexpected but inspired."" ""In an increasingly challenging and volatile world, President Obama has given a sense of hope and optimism to millions around the world"" and ""has shown that the only way forward is through genuine cooperation with other nations."" Former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, last year's Peace Prize laureate, said it was clear the Nobel committee wanted to encourage Obama on the issues he has been discussing on the world stage. Wangari Muta Maathai, the Kenyan who won the 2004 Peace Prize, said Obama's win will help Africa move forward. ""I think it is extraordinary,"" she said. ""It will be even greater inspiration for the world. He has shown how we can probably come together, work together in a cooperative way."" Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, the 2002 peace prize laureate, called the selection ""a bold statement of international support for his vision and commitment to peace and harmony in international relations."" He said the move reflects the ""hope"" the Obama administration represents across the globe. At the United Nations, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon congratulated Obama, calling it ""great news for President Obama, for the people of the United States and for the United Nations. ""We are entering an era of renewed multilateralism, a new era where the challenges facing humankind demand global common cause and uncommon global effort,"" he said. ""President Obama embodies the new spirit of dialogue and engagement on the world's biggest problems: climate change, nuclear disarmament and a wide range of peace and security challenges."" CNN founder Ted Turner, who now heads the philanthropic United Nations Foundation he also started, offered congratulations. ""We applaud his commitment to reengaging the international community and supporting global institutions, such as the United Nations,"" Turner said in a statement. ""In less than one year, President Obama has elevated the importance of the United Nations and global cooperation in its policies.""","Surprise, praise and astonishment echoed in reaction to Obama peace prize .

"Boston (CNN)A U.S. appeals court has rejected a fourth request to move the trial for the accused Boston Marathon bomber to another city. The death penalty trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been delayed by painstaking jury selection, crippling snowstorms and last-ditch appeals for change of venue. Earlier this month, Judge George O'Toole, along with the prosecution and defense teams, settled on a pool of 70 jury prospects after questioning 256 people over three weeks. Before the appeals court ruled Friday, the defense tried three times to persuade O'Toole to move the trial, claiming it couldn't find an impartial jury in Boston. He refused. The attorneys will weed out jurors they believe are less sympathetic to their case next week. When that is done, the panel of 12 jurors and six alternates is expected to be formally seated to hear opening statements and the first witnesses to an event that cut Boston to its core. O'Toole indicated the trial could last well into June. The jurors first will decide whether Tsarnaev is guilty of using weapons of mass destruction to kill people at a large public event. If Tsarnaev is convicted, the jury then will decide whether he should be punished by life in prison without the possibility of release or death, most likely by lethal injection. Potential jurors were questioned at length about whether they believed Tsarnaev was guilty and whether they could consider the death penalty in a state where it hasn't been an option in a generation. Massachusetts wiped the death penalty from its books for good in 1984, and no one has been executed there since 1947. But this case is being tried in federal court, and 17 of the 30 counts against Tsarnaev include the death penalty as a possible punishment. Also cited are so-called aggravating factors such as committing an act of terror and the tender age of the youngest person killed, 8-year-old Martin Richard. Many potential jurors said they thought Tsarnaev was guilty of the April 15, 2013, bombings, which killed three people near the finish line. He is also charged in the April 19, 2013, death of Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier. The officer was ambushed in his patrol car and shot to death as Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, ran from police hours after their photographs were released to the public. Opening statements and the first witnesses originally were slated for January 26, but it took longer than anticipated to question the prospective jurors. Many of the jury prospects struggled with questions about where they stood on the death penalty and whether they could follow the law and vote for capital punishment if the facts and the law led them to that decision. It is almost certain that the trial, which will include wrenching testimony and video footage of the bombing victims, will be well underway during the running of this year's Boston Marathon on April 20. Tsarnaev, 21, is accused of building two homemade pressure cooker bombs with his brother. The bombs detonated within moments of each other near the finish line. Aside from the three deaths, more than 250 people were injured by flying shrapnel and nails. Several survivors lost limbs. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died during a gun battle with police, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found hours later, bleeding and hiding in a boat in a Watertown backyard. He had written Islamist slogans on the sides of the boat, federal authorities allege. No cameras are allowed at the Tsarnaev trial. But CNN's Ann O'Neill will be there every day.

"More than a year ago, Steve Carter was browsing online and came across a missing children's website. To his astonishment, after clicking through the pages, he found himself. What followed was a yearlong story of self-discovery. Carter, a 35-year-old software salesman, was adopted at age 4 from an orphanage in Honolulu. When he grew up, got married and thought about having his own children, the Philadelphia resident grew more curious about his own roots. ""CNN covered Carlina White's story. It popped up on my iPad, and right from there I went to the center's website,"" Carter said, referring to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. White, an Atlanta woman who made headlines last year after she found her own baby picture on the website, discovered that she had been kidnapped as a 3-week-old infant from a Harlem hospital in 1987 by a woman posing as a nurse. She reunited with her biological family in an emotional meeting last January. Reading White's tale, Carter said, made him wonder about his own. On a hunch, he clicked on Missingkids.com in hopes of answering the unanswered questions about his origins. It was there he found an age-progression image made from a photograph of him as an infant. Carter recognized himself immediately, he said, and contacted the Honolulu Police Department. ""I let them know my info and they ran with it,"" he said. ""They were the ones who did all the legwork"" of investigating the case. Carter then volunteered for a DNA test in February 2011. Eight months later its findings revealed fragments of his story and the name he'd been given at birth: Marx Panama Moriarty Barnes. His biological father, Mark Barnes, reported him missing more than three decades ago after his mother, Charlotte Moriarty, took him for a walk and didn't return. Carter says he believes Moriarty put him in the Hawaiian orphanage and told authorities his name was Tenzin Amea. CNN could not independently confirm that account. Barnes, who now lives in California with his two daughters, was not immediately available for comment, and Moriarty's whereabouts are unknown. This January, Carter decided to contact his newfound relatives over the phone. ""They knew I had been located, but they were very surprised,"" Carter said, describing the experience as ""a lot to digest."" ""You see a lot of these reunion stories and a day later they're meeting their parents,"" he said. ""I'm still going forward, testing the waters."" Carter says that while he intends to meet his kin at some point, he also wants to uncover what happened in the three-week period between his reported disappearance and his arrival at the orphanage in Hawaii. And yet authorities say stories like Carter's and White's are rare. Thousands of children under the age of 18 go missing each year, the center for missing children reported. Many of those youths are considered runaways and return home, though hundreds of the long-term missing often prove far more difficult to track down. ""We encourage folks who have doubts to look on the website,"" said Robert Lowery, the center's executive director. Carter described his experience as ""a happy ending to a story that usually isn't a happy ending."" ""Good things do happen,"" he said.","Steve Carter, 35, was adopted at age 4 from an orphanage in Honolulu.

"DNA tests prove that a Roma couple living in Bulgaria are the biological parents of a blond, blue-eyed girl seized from another Roma couple in Greece,  the Bulgarian Interior Ministry said Friday. The DNA tests confirm that Sashka Ruseva and Atanas Rusev are the biological parents of the girl known as ""Maria,"" according to the Interior Ministry. Sashka Ruseva came forward Thursday to say that she is the girl's mother and that she left her in the care of a couple she had worked for in Bulgaria in 2009. ""We gave her, we gifted her, without money,"" she told Bulgaria's TV7 on Thursday. ""I didn't take any money. I didn't have any food to give to the kid. I saw it yesterday and I've been sick. I haven't eaten since last night."" What will happen to the girl now is unclear. She is in the care of the Greek children's charity Smile of the Child, said the group's spokesman, Panagiotis Pardalis. Authorities took her from the Greek Roma couple last month after her appearance raised questions about her origins.  Her features didn't appear to be similar to those of the couple, who have darker complexions typical of Roma. Greek authorities charged the Roma couple living in Greece -- Eleftheria Dimopoulou, 40, and Christos Salis, 39 -- with abducting the child. They appeared in court Monday and were remanded into custody pending trial. Medical tests showed she wasn't their daughter, authorities have said. Their lawyers said the couple took Maria, believed to be 5 or 6 years old, into their home after her biological mother, who they say was from Bulgaria, was unable to look after her. CNN visits Roma community where 'Maria' was found . Residents of the Roma community where the girl lived said the story is true. ""Maria used to play here with the other children and go to the store with her mum; Maria was not hidden away,"" Maria Kaleas said. ""The mother gave her away and Eleftheria was enchanted by Maria's beauty. She shared the food for her own children with Maria."" Roma, who descended from Indian nomads, face widespread discrimination in Europe. Longstanding prejudice in Greece and elsewhere in Europe depicts them as a people who steal children for forced labor, Amnesty International has said. Authorities have produced no evidence that that was the case with Maria, although the Greek government news agency raised ""the possibility of the existence of a ring bringing pregnant women to Greece from Bulgaria and then taking their children for sale."" Photo blog: The plight of the Roma . The agency cited past reports that empty coffins had been found for infants who supposedly were stillborn to foreign mothers in Athens. In a separate case, a Greek couple was arrested Wednesday on suspicion of buying a Roma baby from the child's mother, Greek police said Friday. The suspects, ages 53 and 48, are accused of buying the child in March for 4,000 euros ($5,510), police said in a statement. They were to appear in court Friday to face charges. The couple is alleged to have sought the baby because they had no children of their own, police said. In yet another case involving Roma and children, Irish authorities this week returned a blond, blue-eyed girl to her Roma parents after DNA tests confirmed she is their daughter, a source familiar with the case's legal proceedings told CNN on Wednesday. Police, acting on a tip, had removed the 7-year-old from a home Monday and placed her in protective care before returning her to her parents.

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)A huge explosion killed at least 23 people and wounded 48 others during a Houthi gathering in the central Yemeni province of Ibb on Wednesday, Yemen's Interior Ministry said. The explosion took place in the local cultural center, where the Houthis were preparing for the celebration of the Prophet Mohammed's birthday, which will take place Saturday. The governor of Ibb was present at the location of the attack but fled unharmed. The injured were taken to Al Thawra and Al Manar hospitals. Police officials said the number killed had risen from an earlier tally of 16 after several of the critically injured died from their wounds. According to one security official, a suicide bomber carried out the attack. No group has claimed responsibility for the bombing. Local security officials told CNN the attack had the hallmarks of al Qaeda. Yemen in midst of an upheaval . Houthis follow the Zaidi sect of Islam and are considered Shiites by al Qaeda, a Sunni extremist group. There has been a series of recent attacks on Houthi targets across the country. The Houthis swept to power in Yemen after signing a ceasefire deal with the government in September, ending a political crisis that had halted life in the capital, Sanaa, and left more than 300 dead in a month. Its members have since installed themselves in key positions in the government and financial institutions. One month after signing the ceasefire deal, Houthis took control of large areas of the Sunni-dominated Ibb province, following weeks of clashes with militants. Dozens of fighters from both sides were killed in the fighting. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","The death toll from the blast is now 23, with 48 wounded, Interior Ministry says .

"(CNN)A leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has claimed responsibility for last week's deadly attack by brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. Here's what we know about the Islamist extremist group. AQAP has its home in Yemen, an impoverished and troubled nation that borders Saudi Arabia and Oman and eyes strife-torn Somalia across the Gulf of Aden. In recent months, the Sunni extremist group has come under pressure within Yemen from Shiite Houthi rebels and government forces. But the Paris attack shows the group's apparent continued ability to direct operations beyond Yemen's borders. Its influence on would-be jihadis is also widereaching, thanks to its slick, English-language online magazine, Inspire, first published in 2010. As military operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan have squeezed the central leadership of al Qaeda, its affiliates have stepped forward as the main perpetrators of terror attacks, though recently challenged for the spotlight by ISIS. AQAP chief Nasir al-Wuhayshi is al Qaeda's No. 2 and has so far remained loyal to the terror network's leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri. He was designated as al-Zawahiri's global deputy in 2013. AQAP late last year issued a rebuke to ISIS -- already cut off by al Qaeda's general command in February -- reflecting a certain rivalry between al Qaeda and ISIS, as the latter seeks to extend its reach beyond Iraq and Syria. Some analysts say that rivalry could prompt each terror group to escalate. ""The tension, and the competition, between al Qaeda and ISIS is tremendous,"" says Matthew Levitt at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ""They're in competition for money. They're in competition for recruits. They're in competition for the attention of the media."" He said AQAP had recently been eclipsed in the race for global impact. ""They hadn't carried out anything spectacular in quite some time, and were becoming second fiddle to their jihadi competitors in ISIS,"" he said. Meanwhile, ""ISIS has tremendous things to point to for their success: The holding [of] territory; they've established a caliphate. The vast majority of foreign fighters who are traveling from around the world are flocking not to al Qaeda, but to ISIS."" Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula first emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2002, but thanks to the efforts of the Saudi authorities was a mostly spent force by 2005, according to analysis from Jane's World Insurgency and Terrorism. It re-emerged, reinvigorated, in Yemen in 2009 after the Saudi outfit merged with a Yemeni al Qaeda counterpart, the analysis said. In a video statement released a week after the bloody shooting at the magazine's Paris offices, AQAP commander Nasr Ibn Ali al-Ansi claimed full responsibility for the attack. ""We clarify to the Islamic world that the one who chose the target, laid the plan, financed the operation and appointed its emir, is the leadership of the organization,"" he said. Al-Ansi described the Kouachi brothers as heroes, saying they not only accepted their terror assignment but ""promised and fulfilled."" He said the arrangements for the operation had been made by the group's late leader, radical American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, ""who threatens the West both in his life and after his martyrdom."" The attack was revenge for the magazine's depictions of the Prophet Mohammed, he said. Al-Ansi blamed not only Charlie Hebdo, but also France and the United States in his statement. U.S. National Security Council spokesman Alistair Baskey said the intelligence community was working to determine the video's authenticity. There have been conflicting accounts as to which of the brothers went to Yemen -- or whether, indeed, it was both -- and how many times. But a senior Yemeni security source told CNN the Yemenis believe both were in Yemen for about three months, starting in April 2011. It is unclear how much of the time the brothers spent together. The official added the Yemenis do not believe Cherif attended language schools in Sanaa, as his brother had earlier. It is thought likely that one or both of the brothers received weapons training from AQAP while in Yemen and that one may have met with al-Awlaki. A Yemeni journalist and researcher, Mohammed al-Kibsi, told CNN he had twice met and spoken with Said Kouachi in the capital, Sanaa, and that Kouachi had briefly roomed there with the failed ""underwear bomber"" Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab. Investigators believe Cherif Kouachi was in Yemen in 2011 and that when he left, he was carrying money from AQAP earmarked to carry out attacks, a U.S. official told CNN. The investigators believe AQAP could have provided as much as $20,000 but the United States hasn't verified the exact amount. U.S. officials consider AQAP the most dangerous branch of al Qaeda, according to CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank. In November, AQAP released a statement calling on Muslims around the world to forget their differences and renew their efforts to carry out operations against American targets, whether civilian, military or diplomatic. The U.S. State Department's Rewards for Justice program has posted a reward of up to $10 million for information that brings al-Wuhayshi to justice, saying he ""has provided significant support for AQAP terrorist operations."" He has been a Specially Designated Global Terrorist since 2010. And while al-Awlaki was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in 2011, the radical cleric's influence lives on -- and with it a threat to the United States, says CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen. Al-Awlaki was an influence on Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who are alleged to have killed three people in the Boston Marathon bombings in 2013, Bergen said. He also influenced Carlos Bledsoe, who shot up an Army recruiting center in Little Rock, Arkansas, killing an American soldier in 2009. After the attacks, Bledsoe said his spiritual inspiration was al-Awlaki. Maj. Nidal Hasan killed 13 people at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009 after sending 18 emails to al-Awlaki in Yemen, a correspondence that was known to the FBI. Al-Awlaki did not direct this attack, but he was the key inspiration for Hasan. AbdulMutallab's botched attempt to bring down an American jet over Detroit in the fall of 2009 also was directed by al-Awlaki, Bergen said. A video released by AQAP's official media arm in December showed a short clip of AbdulMutallab together with both al-Wuhayshi and al-Awlaki. AQAP set out its objectives in a May 2010 statement as the ""expulsion of Jews and crusaders"" from the Arabian Peninsula, the re-establishment of the Islamic caliphate, the introduction of Sharia, or Islamic law, and the liberation of Muslim lands, according to analysis from Jane's World Insurgency and Terrorism. This suggests the group aims to rid Yemen and Saudi Arabia of non-Muslims and overthrow the nations' governments, to be replaced with what it considers to be an Islamic state. To that end, it has targeted foreigners and government forces in Yemen, as well as Saudi leaders. In 2009, Prince Mohammed bin Naif bin Abdulaziz, the Saudi Arabian deputy minister of interior, survived a bomb attack carried out by an AQAP militant. Through its Inspire magazine, the group also hopes to radicalize Western Muslims and stoke grass-roots jihadist action in Western nations, the Jane's report says. The group's current incarnation ""is widely considered to be the al Qaeda regional franchise that represents the most serious international threat,"" it concludes. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz, Tim Lister, Paul Cruickshank, Dugald McConnell, Barbara Starr and Michelle Kosinski contributed to this report, as did journalist Hakim Almasmari.","The Yemen-based al Qaeda affiliate has played a part in several attacks against the West .
One or both of the Kouachi brothers are believed to have had contact with AQAP in Yemen ."
"In the mid-1990s, conditions were right for California to build the multilingual economy of the future. A slumping economy needed a boost. A remarkably multilingual population -- including millions of Spanish speakers -- was already in place. Bilingual education programs -- pioneered and developed in Miami over the prior three decades -- were already being established in school districts from San Diego to San Francisco. But in 1998, with globalization knocking ever more loudly on its door, Californians voted instead to pass a ballot measure known as Proposition 227 that imposed wide-reaching restrictions on bilingual education, effectively banning it. They were convinced that California's language diversity -- especially its Spanish -- was a problem to be eradicated, rather than a resource to be developed. In the 16 years since the measure was approved, California has largely squandered one of its most valuable economic and cultural resources. Millions of Spanish-speaking immigrant students lost the opportunity to learn or retain valuable literacy skills in Spanish while they acquired English. And, millions of California-born Latinos who enrolled in school with the gift of native bilingualism would later leave school unable to read and write in Spanish. Fewer Latinos will speak Spanish, more non-Latinos will, report says . When bilingual education mostly disappeared from California in 1998, so did millions of opportunities, economic and otherwise. Today, Proposition 227 is once again in the news, as California state Sen. Ricardo Lara has proposed legislation designed to repeal it. This is especially important for the state because come March, the Latino population is projected to surpass that of whites to become the single largest ethnic group. But as we look back on the banning of bilingual education in California -- and anticipate its end -- we shouldn't lose sight of the broader context in which restrictive language policies have found traction in educational settings in the United States. A guide to raising bilingual children . In the mid-19th century, the department of the U.S. federal government, known as the Bureau of Indian Affairs, established a series of English-only boarding schools, whose purpose was to ""acculturate"" or ""save"" Native Americans, by stamping out the use of languages such as Cherokee, Ojibwe, and Navajo. They were remarkably successful in doing so. Later, in the first part of the 20th century, anti-German hysteria in the era of World War I resulted in the systematic closing of long standing German language schools. German-speaking communities in the United States never recovered, and, for the most part, no longer exist. Up until the mid-20th century, schools in parts of Texas segregated Mexican-American students from whites, routinely shaming, punishing, and expelling them for speaking Spanish at school. A moment I'll never forget from my research there was when an elderly woman described the consequence of speaking Spanish at school as a child. She told me, ""Nos echaron afuera. Sí, te expulsaban de la escuela."" (They kicked us out. Yes, they used to expel you from school.) The tears welled up in her eyes as she spoke. But the examples are not only from the past. Recently, the principal of a public middle school in Hempstead, Texas, made an announcement over the school's intercom system that the use of Spanish would be banned at school, effective immediately. Latino students, approximately half of the student body, also reported being told by teachers they would be punished for speaking Spanish on school grounds. Restrictive language policies toward Spanish in U.S. schools are especially common, in part because the nature of Spanish and Spanish speakers in this country remain deeply misunderstood among the general public. Consider how the following myths about Spanish in the U.S. differ from empirical reality. Myth No. 1: Latinos in the U.S. do not want to /cannot /will not learn English . Social science data show that Latinos learn English at a rate as fast or faster than that of prior immigrant groups. In over a decade of studying language in U.S. Latino communities, I have yet to meet a single young person who has not desperately wanted to know English, nor have I found a single reference to such a phenomenon in the work of my fellow linguists. Myth No. 2: Speaking Spanish at school detracts from learning English . This belief is premised on a false dichotomy that pits knowing Spanish against learning English. Fortunately, for non-language-impaired children, knowing one language is not a roadblock in the acquisition of another. In fact, some evidence suggests that policies restricting the use of the home language actually have negative effects on the acquisition of literacy skills in English. Myth No. 3: Children will simply learn Spanish in the home . People tend to think language can be acquired just by receiving enough inputs to ""crack the code"" -- that hearing mom and dad speaking Spanish is enough. But language is much more than the sum of its rules. Language is also the identity you make in it -- the experiences, the relationships, and the memories that come from using the language across many contexts. In many U.S. Latino communities, receptive bilingualism -- a pattern in which parents speak to children in Spanish, who respond in English -- is common. While comprehension is an important language skill, speech production and literacy skills are equally necessary for jobs in the growing bilingual labor market. Myth No. 4: Spanish is taking over U.S. schools . While it is true that the overall number of Spanish speakers in the U.S. is expected to increase, this is due to new immigration. U.S. language history shows that immigrant languages are mostly or completely lost by the third generation. Research shows that Spanish is being lost across generations at roughly the same rate as previous immigrant languages such as Italian and Dutch. Lifelong bilinguals may have more efficient brains . Looking back, it's clear that restrictive language policies such as Proposition 227 have been problematic all along, but in our era of globalization, education that seeks to eradicate the native bilingualism of its students makes less sense than ever in economic and sociocultural terms. Now with some 45 million speakers and a 500-year history, Spanish in the United States is an economic and cultural resource to be cherished and carefully cultivated, not dismantled one generation after the next. It is therefore time to thoroughly rethink the system that takes Spanish away from young children, only to feebly reintroduce it to them 10 years later as ""a foreign language."" At that point it is mostly too late. What is instead now desperately needed is linguistically informed education policy that supports the acquisition and maintenance of both languages for all students who want to develop bilingual fluency. We need not force our students to choose one language or the other -- they can have both.","Law banning bilingual education in California schools may be overturned by new bill .

"(CNN)Leonard Nimoy, whose portrayal of ""Star Trek's"" logic-driven, half-human science officer Spock made him an iconic figure to generations, died Friday. He was 83. Nimoy died this morning in Bel Air, California, his son Adam Nimoy told CNN. According to his granddaughter, Madeleine Nimoy, the cause of death was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. His ""Star Trek"" co-stars, including William Shatner and George Takei, expressed sadness at his death. ""We return you now to the stars, Leonard. You taught us to 'Live Long And Prosper,' and you indeed did, friend,"" Takei wrote. Fans honor Nimoy with tweets, Vulcan salute . Nimoy's career in show business spanned more than six decades and included stints as a stage actor, television guest star, series regular and movie veteran. He also directed a handful of films, including the box-office hit ""Three Men and a Baby"" in 1987. He was a singer (of sorts), a published poet and an accomplished photographer. But his lasting claim to fame remains Spock, a native of the planet Vulcan whose pointed ears, unemotional manner and frequently uttered ""fascinating"" endeared him to millions. Astronaut Chris Hadfield remembered him as an ""inspiration."" He felt a close connection to the character. ""Spock is definitely one of my best friends. When I put on those ears, it's not like just another day. When I become Spock, that day becomes something special,"" he told Starlog in 1989. Still, as an actor, he wrestled with the typecasting that came with his close association with Spock. He titled a 1975 memoir ""I Am Not Spock."" Though the book was less a rejection of the character than what he went through to develop him, fans took umbrage. Twenty years later, he called another memoir ""I Am Spock."" He maintained a sense of humor about being confused with a 23rd-century space voyager. ""I had an embarrassing experience once, many years ago,"" he told The New York Times in 2009. ""I was invited to go to Caltech and was introduced to a number of very brilliant young people who were working on interesting projects. ... And they'd say to me, 'What do you think?' Expecting me to have some very sound advice. And I would nod very quietly and very sagely I would say, 'You're on the right track.' "" To the stars . Leonard Simon Nimoy was actually born in Boston, far from Vulcan, on March 26, 1931. (His longtime ""Trek"" colleague, William Shatner, was born four days earlier in Montreal.) His parents were Russian immigrants, and he was raised in an Orthodox Jewish family. He incorporated some of his religious heritage into the ""Star Trek"" character, most notably the hand gesticulation accompanied by the phrase ""Live long and prosper."" It was adopted from a blessing given by a Jewish priestly class called the kohanim. Nimoy credited writer Theodore Sturgeon for the phrase ""Live long and prosper,"" a variation of a spoken blessing. Nimoy continued to use the phrase long after his ""Star Trek"" days: On Twitter, he would close his tweets with the abbreviation ""LLAP."" Upon graduating from high school, Nimoy acted in small productions. After encouragement from other actors, he applied to the Pasadena Playhouse in California and was accepted. He moved to the West Coast when he was 18. His early years were bumpy; he found the Playhouse ""disappointing"" and left after a few months and, in between roles, served in the military and took jobs such as driving a cab. Nimoy eventually gained steady work as a character actor, taking parts on such series as ""Bonanza,"" ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""Dragnet."" It was a 1964 appearance on a show about Marines, ""The Lieutenant,"" that brought him to the attention of Gene Roddenberry, the show's producer. Nimoy in 2010: ""I feel very fulfilled"" with my work . Roddenberry had pitched a science-fiction series as "" 'Wagon Train' to the stars"" and liked the idea of casting Nimoy as the series' science officer, an alien originally with red-tinted skin. Nimoy got the part in the show, which was called ""Star Trek."" (Roddenberry drew several other ""Trek"" performers from ""The Lieutenant,"" including Nichelle Nichols, Majel Barrett and future ""Trek"" guest star Gary Lockwood.) ""Star Trek"" was never a major hit during its original broadcast run. It lasted just three seasons and got the third partly because of an intense viewer lobbying campaign. But the characters became indelible: Shatner's gung-ho Capt. James T. Kirk; DeForest Kelley's wisecracking doctor, ""Bones"" McCoy; James Doohan's chief engineer, Montgomery ""Scotty"" Scott; and all the rest of a diverse and -- with the exception of the half-Vulcan Spock -- all-too-human crew. According to the Internet Movie Database, Nimoy made $1,250 an episode for ""Trek's"" first season. Though always popular with audiences -- Shatner remembered being disappointed that Nimoy got more fan mail than he did -- Spock wasn't a hit with network executives, at least at first. His pointed ears made him look satanic, the executives said, and his character was dry and logical, as opposed to the energetic Kirk. But Nimoy brought a much-needed humor to the character, with selectively raised eyebrows and deadpan delivery, and he quickly became a favorite of ""Trek"" fans. Nimoy even put out a few albums of songs. The character has entered the culture as an archetype of an unemotional intellectual; when New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd wants to criticize President Obama as being distant, she refers to him as Spock. Opinion: Nimoy is Spock, Spock is Nimoy . Into the movies . After three years, ""Star Trek"" went off the air. Nimoy quickly rebounded by joining the cast of ""Mission: Impossible"" as Paris, part of Peter Graves' secret-agent team. In the '70s, he made a few movies -- the most notable being the 1978 remake of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" -- and a handful of TV guest appearances. He also hosted the syndicated show ""In Search of ..."" and appeared in a number of stage plays. But Spock was never far away. Despite its short original run, ""Trek's"" 79 episodes had become rerun gold after the show's cancellation, creating hardcore fans nicknamed ""Trekkies"" and bringing the voyages of the starship Enterprise to a new generation. The show was revived for a cartoon series in the mid-1970s. Then Hollywood came calling with a theatrical feature, 1979's ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture,"" which reunited the original cast. Though the film garnered mixed reviews, it was a box-office success and led to a series of sequels, under the ""Trek"" banner, that continue to this day. The ""Trek"" movie series also gave Nimoy a chance to direct. He helmed both the third and fourth films, 1984's ""The Search for Spock"" (which takes place after the Spock character dies in the second film, though he's eventually revived) and 1986's ""The Voyage Home."" Following ""The Voyage Home,"" Nimoy directed the biggest box-office hit of 1987, ""Three Men and a Baby."" As a director, his other films include 1988's ""The Good Mother"" and 1990's ""Funny About Love."" Though Spock kept Nimoy busy and well-employed, he found plenty of time for other endeavors. He received an Emmy nomination for the TV movie ""A Woman Called Golda,"" where he appeared with Ingrid Bergman. He lent his voice and appearance to one of the best-loved ""Simpsons"" episodes, ""Marge and the Monorail,"" in 1993 (and later was in 1997's ""The Springfield Files""). He narrated documentaries, provided voice-over for video games and sent up his image in some commercials, including Priceline ads with his old friend Shatner and an Audi commercial with his movie successor as Spock, Zachary Quinto. ""My heart is broken,"" Quinto tweeted Friday. He also took roles in a few other TV series, notably in the paranormal series ""Fringe"" as Dr. William Bell. He lent his voice to Sentinel Prime in 2011's ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon."" Nimoy: ""Fringe"" cast impressed me the most . And he immersed himself in photography, a hobby he'd taken up as a teenager. His works include ""Shekhina,"" a controversial series of female nudes, and ""The Full Body Project.""

"Ryan Ferguson was freed last year after serving nearly 10 years for a murder he said he didn't commit. Now, an attorney for Ferguson has filed a $100 million lawsuit for violations of his civil rights. The suit, filed Monday, names 13 defendants including the city of Columbia, Missouri, the city police department, investigators, the prosecutor's office and others. It alleges nine separate counts including suppression and fabrication of evidence, failure to investigate, malicious prosecution, conspiracy to deprive Ferguson of his constitutional rights, defamation and false arrest. ""Not only has he not received an apology from the State of Missouri or Boone County, but some of these officials continue to defame him,"" the lawsuit says. ""Compounding this tragedy, the real murderer of Kent Heitholt has escaped arrest, prosecution, and conviction for 13 years because of Ryan's wrongful arrest, prosecution, and conviction."" Ferguson was just a teenager when he was arrested in Missouri in 2004, accused of killing Columbia Tribune sports editor Kent Heitholt three years earlier. Implicated by a former friend who said he had dreamlike memories of committing the crime, Ferguson was convicted in 2005 for Heitholt's murder and given a 40-year sentence. In 2012, the same friend admitted in court that he lied, as did a janitor who originally placed Ferguson at the crime scene. Ferguson's legal team successfully argued last fall that prosecutors illegally withheld evidence that could have cleared his name, overturning his conviction. The Jefferson City Correctional Center released Ferguson in November after Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster said he wouldn't retry Ferguson.","Ryan Ferguson spent nearly 10 years in prison .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Friday's two-train collision killed 25 people and injured more than 130 others near Los Angeles after an engineer failed to heed a traffic signal, a spokeswoman for Metrolink commuter trains said. A commuter rail car lies on its side after a collision Friday near Los Angeles, California. The engineer was guiding the Metrolink train that slammed head-on into a freight train and is not believed to have survived, Metrolink spokeswoman Denise Tyrrell said on Saturday. ""It was human error,"" Tyrrell said, adding this was Metrolink's belief ""barring any new information"" from an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board. NTSB spokeswoman Kitty Higgins said the agency would ""look at everything before we rule anything in or out."" Tyrrell said the engineer, whom she didn't identify, was a subcontractor employed by another company. She said she did not have details of his record. The crash occurred about 4:30 p.m. PT Friday in Chatsworth, a northwest Los Angeles suburb. The Metrolink train had about 220 passengers and two crew members on board at the time, according to Tyrrell.  Watch rescuers search for victims » . Forty-five of the injured were in critical condition, with 40 flown to hospitals, Tyrrell said. Another 50 had minor injuries, and 40 others were treated at the crash site but transported to hospitals for evaluation. ""It was like running into a brick wall at 60 miles an hour,"" an injured passenger told CNN affiliate KABC. In the minutes after the crash, passers-by joined emergency personnel in an effort to free passengers from the wreckage. On Saturday afternoon, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said the search of the wreckage had finished. Earlier in the day, authorities were picking through the wreckage and freeing trapped bodies. Ed Winter, assistant chief of the Los Angeles County coroner's office, told reporters two bodies -- both of females -- had yet to be identified. If the females had carried identification, it probably was lost in the crash, he said. As of 9 a.m. PT Saturday, authorities had been able to notify relatives of eight victims, he said. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger visited the crash site on Saturday, telling reporters it was ""one of the worst train accidents in modern history in California."" The NTSB will make a final determination of the crash's cause. Higgins, the agency's spokeswoman, said data recorders have been recovered from both trains, along with a video recorder from the freight train. Higgins said that out of the trains' five crew members, four survived. Authorities will interview the surviving crew members, Higgins said. Tyrrell said a review of ""a number of programs,"" including the signal system, showed the commuter train's engineer failed to heed a stop signal, Tyrrell said. ""We don't know how the error happened, but this is what we believe happened,"" Tyrrell said. The wreck occurred on a curved part of the track where the speed limit is 40 mph, Tyrrell said. She said that just like road vehicles, trains are subject to signal systems. At the wreck site is a siding where one train can wait while another passes, she said. ""They receive a signal to stop and they must hold their location until other traffic has passed,"" she said. Villaraigosa praised police officers and firefighters for working under emotionally draining conditions and treating the victims with respect. ""This has been a grueling night for them,"" he said. The crash sparked a fire that impeded firefighters's efforts to reach the front commuter car, where most of the injuries occurred, Los Angeles County sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore said. The fire eventually was brought under control. ""We've already found survivors trapped under fatalities,"" Whitmore said late Friday. Among those killed was Spree Desha, 35, a Los Angeles police officer on her way home from work, officials said Saturday. ""It's not unusual for us to respond to disasters,"" said Jerry Szymanski, an assistant commander for the LAPD. ""When we got here, we found it was one that hit close to home."" Desha had ""mentored and trained a lot of the young officers in the North Hollywood area,"" Szymanski said. Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca said Friday night a sheriff's deputy was in a hospital's intensive care unit after collapsing while conducting rescue work. CNN's Ted Rowlands contributed to this report.","NEW: Engineer failed to heed stop signal, Metrolink spokeswoman says .

"(CNN) -- So now we're having a debate about spanking. Seriously? There is a lot of misplaced outrage from folks who are taking recent stories about the misconduct of professional athletes and shoehorning them into a crusade against child abuse. I'm against child abuse. Who isn't? But I'm not against spanking. I have my reasons, and we'll get to them. First, let's deal with the misplaced outrage. Why don't the folks who are worked up over the fact that Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson was indicted last week on a felony charge of child abuse just say what's really on their mind? On the heels of the Ray Rice story, where a videotape was recently released showing the suspended Baltimore Ravens running back hitting and knocking unconscious his then fiancÃ©e (now his wife) in a hotel elevator, there are those who want to tie these two stories together under the template that some of the violence of the NFL may be spilling out onto players' personal lives and the rest of society. If that's the assertion, then let's have that discussion. But let's not mix all that noise together with the more important debate over spanking children. We have to get this right, and -- as the parent of three young children, ages 5, 6, and 7, who has been to more than his share of picnics, birthday parties, and little league games -- I can see firsthand we're getting it wrong. I remember seeing one hapless father chasing after his son, trying to get the boy to listen and pleading: ""You need to respect me."" The lad ignored him. When did parents become such wimps? My dad didn't roll like that. And neither did his father, a Mexican immigrant who -- along with my equally strong and no-nonsense grandmother -- raised five boys from the 1930s to the 1950s with nary an incident. There were no disturbances, no gangs, no police. Later, I teased one of my uncles about that, suggesting they must have had a lot of respect for law or order. ""Heck no,"" he said. ""We were all terrified of the old man."" Fear is essential to respect. Children won't do what we tell them to do, unless -- at some level -- they fear the consequences that will come from not doing it. Punishment isn't a bad word. It's a life lesson. It's the way the world works, and, as parents, it's our job to prepare our kids to enter a world where they learn bad behavior has consequences. Too many parents today are falling down on the job. The problem isn't that too many kids get spanked. It's that some kids who need a spanking might never get one. Opinion: Spanking isn't parenting; it's child abuse . Ten years ago, the problem was that too many parents eager to be their child's BFF (Best Friend Forever) were losing the battle to discipline their children, instill values, influence behavior and teach right from wrong. Today, in many homes, the battle is over and the kids won. In some cases, the parents -- already stressed from long days at work and having no desire to spend precious hours at home squabbling with children -- simply surrendered. They gave up on raising children in exchange for peace and quiet on the home front. Now the kids run things. These pint-sized CEOs of the household tell their parents what to do, instead of the other way around. If mom and dad forget their place in the new world order, junior will simply throw a few verbal daggers and scream: ""You're so mean! I hate you!"" The correct response should be: ""I can live with that. Now go to your room!"" I'm not telling anything you don't already know. If it's not happening in your house, it's happening in your brother's or cousin's or neighbor's. Opinion: Does spanking harm the black community? So let me put in a good word for spanking as an acceptable and sometimes necessary form of disciplining a child, as long as you follow the rules. Here are three: Never use a belt or other foreign object, just the palm on your hand; never hit a child on his bare bottom, only through clothing; and only give them one swat, where you maintain control of your emotions. This is a sensitive subject around my house. My wife and I disagree about spanking. She thinks you should never use violence to discipline a child. But the result of that is my kids sometimes torment mommy to test their boundaries. They want to see just what they can get away with and how far they can push before she cracks and loses her cool. It's excruciating to watch. The cultural, regional and generational roots of spanking . Too many kids in America don't respect their parents -- that's the real threat. They turn on the television and see shows where the kids run things and the parents are bumbling idiots. In fact, many kids don't fear any kind of authority, and this will not serve them well later in life. That's the real sin that many parents commit, neglecting their duty to raise good kids who grow up into respectful and responsible adults. Spanking isn't child abuse. It's common sense. And that's something that every parent needs -- but, as you already know, not every parent has.","Ruben Navarrette: I'm against child abuse. Who isn't? But I'm not against spanking .
Navarrette: Spanking is an acceptable way to discipline a child, as long as you follow the rules .
He says too many kids in America today don't respect their parents - that's the real threat .

"(CNN)A late goal from Moussa Sow secured Senegal all three points in dramatic fashion as it saw off Ghana 2-1 in the Africa Cup of Nations Group C opener at Estadio de Mongomo Monday. With the scores tied at 1-1 and the match running deep into stoppage time, Senegal seemed as if it would miss out on a deserved victory after running Ghana ragged for much of the 90 minutes. However, in what proved to be the last meaningful kick of the game, up stepped substitute Sow to round off an excellent Lions move and slot past Brimah Razak to settle the tie. Group C -- billed before the tournament as the ""Group of Death"" -- was wrapped up Monday with Algeria's 3-1 victory over South Africa. After its World Cup exploits last summer, Algeria is favorite to lift the trophy. The Desert Foxes reached the second round of the global tournament in Brazil and took eventual winners Germany to extra time before bowing out. The squad is also the top-ranked side competing in Equatorial Guinea as they sit 18th in FIFA's global ratings. Algeria won its opening Group C tie with South Africa 3-1 but the score could have been very different if it hadn't been for own goals and missed penalties from the ""Bafana Bafana."" Goals from Faouzi Ghoulam and Islam Slimani won the match for Algeria along with Thulani Hlatshwayo's own goal. Ghana had come into its earlier match as favorite as it attempts to claim a first African title in 33 years, having reached the final four on the last four occasions, including a second-placed finish in 2010. Former Chelsea and West Ham boss Avram Grant is the man charged with the task of ending the Black Stars' drought, yet his first competitive clash as Ghana coach has left him with much work lying ahead. Ghana had to do without captain Asamoah Gyan as he continues to recover from a bout of malaria, but was able to call on brothers Andre and Jordan Ayew -- and it was the younger sibling who opened the scoring in Equatorial Guinea. The forward converted a well-taken penalty to net his fifth goal in his last six appearances for his country after Christian Atsu had been brought down in the area by Senegal goalkeeper Bouna Coundal. Without injured Southampton forward Sadio Mane, Senegal saw much of the ball throughout the first half but struggled to convert that possession into clear-cut chances, although Kara Mbodji's header rattled the crossbar and Mame Biram Diouf saw a superb bicycle kick saved. Alain Giresse's team, however, was rewarded for its pressure soon after the break with Diouf -- who plays for English Premier League club Stoke -- converting the rebound, after his original header had come back off the post, to level proceedings. Four-time champion Ghana look rattled and Senegal seemed to determined to pounce, only for chance after chance to be tossed away -- Diouf and Pape Diop were guilty of wasting golden opportunities, while the Lions mustered 13 more attempts on goal than their opponent. With the referee moments away from blowing the final whistle, the Black Stars looked set to escape with a fortunate point, before Sow stepped up to send Senegal and its supporters wild.","Senegal picks up three points in Group C opener against Ghana .

"""Move on, Jews! Your home is at Auschwitz! Send you to the gas (chamber)!"" These are comments that you might expect to hear in 1940s Europe, but in 2014? Apparently yes, according to a Polish municipal prosecutor in Poznan, who decided this week that chants by football fans are not criminal offenses. The incident, which happened during a Polish league game between Lech Poznan and Widzew Lodz on September 29, 2013, has sparked debate over the country's attitude towards anti-Semitism. ""This case is being discussed a lot in Poland and rightly causing critique of the system and its decision,"" Polish football writer Michal Zachodny told CNN. ""Although the PZPN, the Polish Football Association, has introduced stricter laws and are more proactive in dealing with such problems than they were, there is no plan, no willingness to do anything with the problem. ""There is no special police line to report abuse anonymously."" PZPN did not respond to CNN's request for comment. Prosecutor Monika Rutkowsk decided not to take any action against the Poznan fans on the grounds that their chants were directed at the opposing team and not specifically at Jews. The team, Lech Poznan, said in a statement to CNN, ""The club has already expressed its condemnation of this type of behavior and has fulfilled its obligations to the police and prosecutors."" ""The club does not deal in the prosecution of groups of fans, because this is the task of the aforementioned police and prosecutors. ""One of the aims of the club is to educate its fans, to talk with them and eradicate certain issues. This approach has been in place at the club for many years."" Anti-Semitism within Polish football is not a new phenomenon. In a country where some of the worst atrocities of the Holocaust were committed, the home of Auschwitz, this latest episode will be difficult for many outside of Poland to comprehend. Widzew has often been often targeted because of its links to the Jewish community which was exterminated by the Nazis during the Holocaust. Known as a ""Jewish club"" in the same way as English team Tottenham Hotspur and Dutch side Ajax are, Widzew and the city's smaller club, LKS Lodz, are often taunted by rival team's fans. Poland was home to the largest Jewish community in Europe before the Holocaust, when 90% of the country's 3.3 million Jews were killed by the Nazis. Today there are an estimated  25,000. Moshe Kantor, the President of the European Jewish Congress, says the decision has consolidated a view that anti-Semitism is the ""last acceptable prejudice in football."" ""Unfortunately, extreme anti-Semitic chants like those in Poznan are regularly heard in many European stadiums, including in England and Holland, and the reaction of the authorities is minimal,"" Kantor said in a statement on the organization's website. The problems within Polish football are not confined to Poznan and Lodz -- Krakow and Warsaw witness similar incidents whenever those cities' clubs play each other. Cracovia, a club founded by Jews in 1906, endures a hateful relationship with its Krakow city rival Wisla, which is driven by anti-Semitism. Wisla's hardcore supporters, known as the ""Anti Jude Gang,"" are infamous for their chanting and banners, even though the club has signed Jewish players in the past. ""It is naive to think that there isn't still an anti-Semitism problem in Poland, however the most worrying thing is that in some cases it clearly isn't seen as a problem at all,"" Ryan Hubbard of Ekstraklasa Magazine told CNN. ""The irony in some of these chants is that the perpetrators sometimes have Jewish players within their teams. ""Maor Melikson, an Israeli international, and his fellow countryman David ""Dudu"" Biton, played a massive part in Wisla Krakow's title success in 2010-11 -- Melikson even scoring the winner against rivals Cracovia, which won the title. ""But even since then, it isn't uncommon to hear these chants used in a derogatory way."" The frustration for many is that the authorities, including the PZPN, do not seem to be tackling the problem head on. There are a number of stories of anti-Semitic banners being paraded in stadiums and similarly offensive t-shirts being sold outside venues. The tale of how Resovia fans displayed a banner at the home game against local rival Stal depicting a Jewish man in an Auschwitz uniform with a ""no entry"" sign across his face and the slogan, ""Death to those with curved noses,"" is just one that has come to prominence. In September 2011, when Israeli side Hapoel Tel Aviv played at Legia Warsaw, its players and fans were abused throughout the contest. Legia's supporters, who are renowned for being racist, unveiled a large ""Jihad"" banner behind the goal while holding up placards. Two weeks later, the same fans chanted ""Hamas, Hamas, Jews off to the gas,"" at  Lodz fans instead of the traditional chant of, ""Your home is Auschwitz, all Poland knows that the entire Jewish army is going to the gas chamber."" ""I wouldn't say that all Polish fans are anti-Semitic or that this is a common situation because it's not,"" added Zachodny. ""The problem is real, though, and comes from the fact that most of the ultras groups and hooligans are connecting themselves to far-right movements which they take and explain as patriotic. ""Unfortunately, many of them despite not being anti-Semitic, use the chants often, also claiming it is because it was always like that, it should not be understood as racism or anti-Semitism or anything like that. ""That is dangerous as well, obviously, while PZPN is not doing anything about it -- rarely even commenting it."" The incident in Poland came just weeks after French footballer Nicolas Anelka courted controversy by making the ""quenelle"" gesture after scoring for West Bromwich Albion in the English Premier League. The ""quenelle"" involves pointing the right arm down at an angle and touching that arm with the left hand. Anelka has said that the celebration was nothing more than a nod to his friend, controversial French comedian Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala, who has popularized the gesture in France. But others believe the gesture is a Nazi salute in reverse, and it has been linked to rising anti-Semitism in France -- a charge over which Dieudonne, a holocaust denier, faces an investigation by the Paris prosecutor's office. The English Football Association has yet to make a decision on whether the player will face sanctions. But Kantor believes that the incident in Poland, coupled with Anelka's gesture, has brought about a new wave of anti-Semitism within football. ""We have seen quick condemnation, bans and major fines when other minorities are attacked by players and fans in Europe, but barely a whimper is heard when Jews are subject to attack,"" he said in the statement. ""It has been over two weeks since Anelka's offensive salute and it is completely clear to all that the gesture was designed to offend Jews by an unrepentant anti-Semite and Holocaust-denier. ""The silence on behalf of the football authorities compounds the original offense by Anelka, and if it is not harshly dealt with it will be seen as implicit acceptance of this anti-Semitic affront.""","Polish municipal officer rules that chants by Lech Poznan supporters not anti-Semitic .

"(CNN) -- Comedian Joan Rivers is ""resting comfortably"" in a New York hospital after apparently suffering cardiac and respiratory arrest during a procedure at a medical clinic Thursday. Her daughter, Melissa Rivers, issued a statement on Friday. ""My mother would be so touched by the tributes and prayers that we have received from around the world,"" she said. ""Her condition remains serious but she is receiving the best treatment and care possible. We ask that you continue to keep her in your thoughts as we pray for her recovery."" A law enforcement official told CNN that Rivers stopped breathing during throat surgery. Rivers, 81, was taken by ambulance in critical condition to Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. The clinic address given by a New York Fire Department spokesman is a building that houses an endoscopy clinic where doctors perform minor procedures on patients. The clinic is a mile away from the hospital. Rivers had been scheduled to perform her comedy act at the Count Basie Theater in Red Bank, New Jersey, Friday night. Michael Lucas, who was in the audience for Rivers' show at New York's Beechman Theater Wednesday night, told CNN that she joked about death. ""She said, 'You know I'm 81 years old, and I could drop dead at any moment and you would be so lucky because you will have a story to tell your friends for the rest of your life,'"" Lucas said. ""Then she mimicked people talking about what it was like to see her drop dead on stage."" Rivers was in fine form, he said. ""There was no sign (Wednesday) night that she was declining. Her show was over an hour long and she never stumbled or even paused to catch her breath."" In 2013, Rivers allowed cameras to record a health scare for her and her daughter's reality show, ""Joan & Melissa: Joan Knows Best?"" Rivers said on the show that doctors found a spot on an X-ray after she had a persistent cough. ""We're just not going to be sad about this,"" Rivers said during the episode. ""We're gonna do jokes and be up until we know. That's how I deal with things. I'm not just gonna sit around the next couple of days and go crazy."" Rivers has been open about her health issues. She was diagnosed with osteoporosis in 2002 after a fall down some stairs left her with broken bones, and she became an advocate for screenings for women. She also admitted to not being as healthy as she could be. ""I try not to be, but I'm a terrible eater,"" she said. ""I wish I could say I eat super-healthy, but I don't.

"A counselor in Brooklyn's Orthodox Jewish community was found guilty Monday of sexually abusing a girl over a period of three years in a case that one victim's advocate described as marking ""a new era."" Nechemya Weberman, 54, was found guilty on all 59 counts he was facing, including sexual conduct against a child. He faces a possible sentence of 117 years in prison, the Kings County District Attorney's office said. The abuse began in 2007, when the girl's parents hired the unlicensed counselor to help their then-12-year-old daughter; it continued -- mostly in his office -- until 2010, the district attorney's office said in a news release. The victim, who testified at trial, is now 17, it said. Pearl Reich, a former Orthodox Jew who identifies herself as a victim's advocate, said the verdict ushers in ""a new era for the Jewish religious community."" Reich told CNN affiliate WCBS that the victim will need a lot of help, but that Weberman's conviction is part of the healing process. ""We're very hopeful that this will lead to other young women in this community and other communities understanding that they can come forward,"" District Attorney Charles Hynes told reporters. ""They will be protected."" The case highlighted practices of the conservative Satmar Hasidic community, many of whom live in the insular Orthodox Jewish neighborhood of South Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Joel Engelman, an advocate against sexual abuse among Orthodox Jews who described himself as a survivor of such abuse, said it is rare for respected members of the community to face such allegations in court. In the past, members of the community have intimidated and pressured those who have accused their leaders of sexual abuse, he said. The case came to light last year, when four men were arrested and accused of trying to bribe Weberman's victim and her boyfriend to get them to drop the case against Weberman, a spokesman for the district attorney said. ""There was a huge fundraiser for the accused Weberman, and the entire community structure was filled with propaganda and hate against the victim in an effort to shut (her and her family) up,"" Engelman said. ""Thankfully, the courage of the young survivor has been tremendous, and she was able to withstand and go through with the process."" George Farkas, Weberman's attorney, was not available for comment. Sentencing is set for January 9.","The abuse began when the girl was 12 .

"(CNN) -- Belgian police have mounted an unprecedented security operation outside the Brussels courtroom where nine members of an alleged terrorist cell linked to al Qaeda are on trial. The security alert followed an announcement by Belgian authorities last weekend that they had information indicating that an armed attack to free the defendants or an escape attempt may be in the works. One of the defendants, Malika El Aroud, has a high profile in pro-al Qaeda circles. El Aroud is the Belgian-Moroccan widow of Abdessattar Dahmane, a Tunisian al Qaeda operative who was involved in the assassination of anti-Taliban Northern Alliance leader Ahmed Shah Massoud on Osama Bin Laden's orders two days before 9/11. Dahmane's comrade used a suicide bomb vest to set off an explosion, which Dahmane survived, but he was later shot dead by Massoud's guards when he ran. Prosecutors Monday confirmed to the court that authorities had reason to believe there was a threat of an attack but did not elaborate, said Christophe Marchand, the attorney for one of the defendants. Belgian authorities Sunday released a statement outlining only ""serious elements and high probabilities."" The extra security includes the placement of barricades and several large bulldozers in front of the court building. Dozens of heavily armed police have been on patrol outside, wearing masks to camouflage their identity. ""It feels like a war zone,"" Marchandsaid, ""the security measures suggest the authorities fear a suicide bombing attack."" A senior Belgian counter-terrorism source briefed on the threat alert said Wednesday that the threat information was obtained by Belgian police over the weekend, but the source played down the threat of imminent attack, saying that the new security measures were taken out of an ""abundance of caution."" With police on high alert, the courtroom was evacuated Tuesday when gas fumes could be smelled in the vicinity of the courtroom, but after a security sweep, the trial resumed. El Aroud is accused of being a leader of a terrorist group that recruited young men in Belgium and France to receive terrorist training in al Qaeda camps in Pakistan. She was arrested in December 2008 after security services intercepted an e-mail indicating that one of the young men she allegedly recruited may have been planning a suicide attack in Brussels. The individual in question, Hicham Beyayo, who was arrested the same day as El Aroud and is also on trial, has denied that the e-mail represented any hostile intent, and has said it was just tough talk to impress an ex-girlfriend. El Aroud's current husband, Moez Garsallaoui, is also a defendant in the trial. Garsallaoui is being tried in absentia, with Belgian intelligence officials believing he is still at large in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region. She did not show up in court Wednesday, stating that the new security arrangements had worsened her agoraphobia, a condition in which individuals fear being in locations or situations from which they cannot easily leave or escape. During the trial, El Aroud has mounted a strident defense of the legitimacy of armed combat against Western military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, but she denied involvement with terrorism. El Aroud has not kept secret her sympathy for al Qaeda. In a CNN interview in 2006, El Aroud said, ""Most Muslims love Osama [Bin Laden]. It was he who helped the oppressed. It was he who stood up against the biggest enemy in the world, the United States. We love him for that."" The trial, which started on March 8, is expected to conclude Friday with verdicts and sentencing expected four to six weeks later.","Nine members of an alleged terrorist cell linked to al Qaeda are on trial .

"Sure, North Korea's government despises the movie ""The Interview."" But when its propagandists say it did not hack Sony Pictures before the original release date of the flick that satirizes dictator Kim Jong-un, they might just be telling the truth. Some U.S. cyber experts say the evidence the FBI has presented to attempt to incriminate hackers working for the communist regime is not enough to pin the blame on Pyongyang. ""It's clear to us, based on both forensic and other evidence we've collected, that unequivocally they are not responsible for orchestrating or initiating the attack on Sony,"" said Sam Glines, who runs the cybersecurity company Norse. The FBI has said that code in the malware used by a group called ""Guardians of Peace"" (GoP) in the attack on Sony is similar to code used by North Korea in other attacks. But that code was leaked a long time ago, experts say. Any hacker anywhere in the world could have used it. There is a group in the Kim regime that is responsible for cyber warfare, but independent IT security researcher Scott Borg doesn't believe North Korea was capable of the Sony hack. ""It's beyond the skill level that we have been able to observe,"" he said. CNN has reached out to the FBI for comment on the doubts about North Korea's involvement in the Sony hack, but has not heard back. Earlier this month, U.S. officials told CNN on condition of anonymity that the National Security Agency and FBI were able to trace the attack back to North Korea. A whodunit . So, North Korea might not have done it. But if not, who did? Sony may be a bur in Pyongyang's fur for the movie, in which an actor playing Kim is confronted by the protagonist with North Korea's human rights record. In the end, they do bloody battle. But Sony has other enemies -- both internal and external. One example could be the group that says it launched a cyberattack on Christmas Day against Sony's PlayStation Network. The Lizard Squad has claimed responsibility for knocking PSN gamers offline and said it had also done the same with Microsoft's Xbox. In the summer, it also smacked game networks Battle.net, Eve Online and League of Legends. But after Sony Online Entertainment acknowledged large-scale attacks on Twitter this summer, the Lizards appear to have gotten particularly nasty with them. Bomb threat . A Tweet sent from an account in the hackers' name alleged there was a bomb on board a plane carrying Sony Online Entertainment president, John Smedley. The plane diverted. The Lizards also claimed responsibility for a PlayStation Network outage early this month, just days after the big Sony Pictures hack that plundered a record-worthy 100 terabytes of data. It included movies, company secrets, employee data, embarrassing internal emails and Social Security numbers of celebrities. Then there are Sony's internal rubs: Security employees have been hit by layoffs. A disgruntled former longtime employee code-named ""Lena"" has ties to GoP, Glines said. And she had high access to company secrets and user data. There's a possibility these weren't hacked away from Sony but given away instead. ""Lena"" was probably mad about layoffs, Glines said, but she may have also commiserated with people who pirated Sony movies and other content ""and how they had been prosecuted in the U.S. and other countries."" CNN asked Sony about Glines' account on ""Lena"" but has received no reply. Deja vu . There are myriad other possibilities. There are hackers for hire. Or -- like that leaked North Korean code -- lots of malware is available through the Internet. Cyberattackers can augment off-the-shelf viruses with customized components. Also, Sony is a broad target that plenty of hackers have taken shots at in the past. In October 2012, the hacker group ""The Three Musketeers"" released a security key that allowed PS3 users to run pirated games. And in April 2011, Sony's PlayStation Network was shut down for nearly a month when hackers stole the personal information of an estimated 77 million people. A 19-year-old Briton, allegedly a member of a hacking group called LulzSec, was arrested over that one. That same year, in June, hackers released 150,000 Sony Pictures records, including user names and passwords, and claimed to have compromised the private information of more than 1 million people. This month's hack was a reprise of that one for critics and for some employees planning to sue the company for failing to protect their privacy.","""Unequivocally, they are not responsible,"" a cybersecurity expert says about North Korea .

"Bolivian President Evo Morales said he is expelling the U.S. Agency for International Development from his country for allegedly meddling and conspiring against the government. ""USAID is out; I ask the foreign minister to immediately communicate with the U.S. Embassy,"" Morales said in a speech Wednesday, according to the state-run ABI news agency. According to USAID's Bolivia website, the agency has operated there since 1964. It says it carries out health, sustainable development and environmental programs in the country. The agency says its 2011 budget for Bolivia was $26.7 million. The State Department called the decision regrettable and said the ones who will be hurt by the expulsion will be ordinary Bolivians. ""We deny the baseless allegations made by the Bolivian government,"" State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said of the accusations that the agency meddled in Bolivian affairs. After Morales' announcement Wednesday, Bolivia's foreign minister called the U.S. Embassy in La Paz to inform officials of the decision and said USAID would be given a ""reasonable"" amount of time to end operations, which employ nine Americans and 37 Bolivians, Ventrell said. Bolivia and the United States have had diminished relations since September 2008, when each country expelled the other's ambassador. Morales, a strong proponent of the cultivation of coca plants -- the source of cocaine -- expelled the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration a month later. He also delivered a strong verbal criticism of the U.S. government at the United Nations General Assembly that year. The order to expel USAID appeared to be off-the-cuff, but it's not the first time it's been suggested. In 2011, an influential Bolivian official accused the agency of ""destabilizing"" the government and called for its ouster. ""The expulsion of USAID should be ... an act of sovereignty,"" Juan Ramon Quintana, director of a Bolivian government development agency and a former top presidential aide, said at the time. The move is also in protest of a comment made by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry at a hearing in Washington last month, Morales said. In response to a question about Latin America, Kerry told lawmakers that ""the Western Hemisphere is our backyard. It's critical to us."" To many in the United States, the reference to ""backyard"" would mean that the Western Hemisphere is a neighbor.  But Morales took offense, apparently interpreting the phrase as derogatory toward Latin America's place in relation to the United States. A history of U.S. policy toward Latin America that asserted American dominance over the region made Kerry's phrase stinging to some. The phrase ""America's backyard"" harkens back to the Monroe Doctrine, which considered Latin America under the influence of the United States. ""We may be a small country, but we deserve respect,"" said Morales, stating his offense to being called the ""back patio"" of the United States. Ventrell said Kerry did not intend to offend anyone with his remarks. ""It's about us being neighbors,"" he said.","U.S. calls allegations by Bolivian president ""baseless""
Was a comment by Kerry partly responsible for Bolivia's expulsion of USAID?
Morales made the announcement, then told his foreign minister to contact U.S.

"The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks beginning in Jerusalem proceed within a framework of assumptions that merit careful thought. One prevailing assumption is that there are two options: either a two-state settlement will be reached, or there will be a ""shift to a nearly inevitable outcome of the one remaining reality -- a state 'from the sea to the river',"" an outcome posing ""an immediate existential threat of the erasure of the identity of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state"" because of what is termed ""the demographic problem,"" a future Palestinian majority in the single state. This particular formulation is by former Israeli Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) chief Yuval Diskin, but the basic assumptions are near universal in political commentary and scholarship. They are, however, crucially incomplete. There is a third option, the most realistic one: Israel will carry forward its current policies with full U.S. economic, military, and diplomatic support, sprinkled with some mild phrases of disapproval. The policies are quite clear. Their roots go back to the 1967 war and they have been pursued with particular dedication since the Oslo Accords of September 1993. The Accords determined that Gaza and the West Bank are an indivisible territorial entity.  Israel and the U.S. moved at once to separate them, which means that any autonomy Palestinians might gain in the West Bank will have no direct access to the outside world. A second step was to carry forward the creation of a vastly expanded Greater Jerusalem, incorporating it within Israel, as its capital. This is in direct violation of Security Council orders and is a serious blow to any hope for a viable Palestinian entity. A corridor to the east of the new Greater Jerusalem incorporates the settler town of Ma'aleh Adumim, established in the 1970s but built primarily after the Oslo Accords, virtually bisecting the West Bank. Corridors to the north including other settler towns divide what is to remain under some degree of Palestinian control -- ""Bantustans,"" as they were called by one of the main architects of the policy, Ariel Sharon, in a reference to the territory set aside for black South Africans during the apartheid era. Meanwhile Israel is incorporating the territory on the Israeli side of the ""separation wall"" cutting through the West Bank, taking arable land and water resources and Palestinian villages. Included are the settlement blocs that ""will remain part of Israel in any possible future peace agreement,"" as stated by Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev as the current negotiations were announced. The International Court of Justice ruled that all of this is illegal, and the Security Council had already ruled that all of the settlements are illegal. The U.S. joined the world in accepting that conclusion in the early years of the occupation. But under Ronald Reagan, the position was changed to ""harmful to peace,"" and Barack Obama has weakened it further to ""not helpful to peace."" Israel has also been clearing the Jordan Valley of Palestinians while establishing Jewish settlements, sinking wells, and otherwise preparing for eventual integration of the region within Israel. That will complete the isolation of any West Bank Palestinian entity. Meanwhile huge infrastructure projects throughout the West Bank, from which Palestinians are barred, carry forward the integration to Israel, and presumably eventual annexation. The areas that Israel is taking over will be virtually free of Arabs. There will be no new ""demographic problem"" or civil rights or anti-apartheid struggle, contrary to what many advocates of Palestinian rights anticipate in a single state. There remain open questions. Notably, pre-Obama, U.S. presidents have prevented Israel from building settlements on the E1 site -- a controversial area in the West Bank that Israel hopes to develop -- which would complete the separation of Greater Jerusalem from Palestinian-controlled area. What will happen here is uncertain. As the negotiations opened, Israel made its intentions clear by announcing new construction in East Jerusalem and scattered settlements, while also extending its ""national priority list"" of settlements that receive special subsidies to encourage building and inducements for Jewish settlers. Obama made his intentions clear by appointing as chief negotiator Martin Indyk, whose background is in the Israeli lobby, a close associate of negotiator and presidential adviser Dennis Ross, whose guiding principle has been that Israel has ""needs,"" which plainly overcome mere Palestinian wants. These developments bring to the fore a second common assumption: that Palestinians have been hindering the peace process by imposing preconditions. In reality, the U.S. and Israel impose crucial preconditions. One is that the process must be in the hands of the United States, which is an active participant in the conflict on Israel's side, not an ""honest broker."" A second is that the illegal Israel settlement activities must be allowed to continue. There is an overwhelming international consensus in support of a two-state settlement on the internationally recognized border, perhaps with ""minor and mutual adjustments"" of this 1949 cease-fire line, in the wording of much earlier U.S. policy. The consensus includes the Arab states and the Organization of Islamic States (including Iran). It has been blocked by the U.S. and Israel since 1976, when the U.S. vetoed a resolution to this effect brought by Egypt, Jordan, and Syria. The rejectionist record continues to the present. Washington's most recent veto of a Security Council resolution on Palestinian territory was in February 2011, a resolution calling for implementation of official U.S. policy -- an end to expansion of Israel's illegal settlements. And the rejectionist record goes far beyond the Security Council. Also misleading is the question whether the hawkish Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would accept a ""Palestinian state."" In fact, his administration was the first to countenance this possibility when it came into office in 1996, following Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, who rejected this outcome.  Netanyahu's associate David bar-Illan explained that some areas would be left to Palestinians, and if they wanted to call them ""a state,"" Israel would not object -- or they could call them ""fried chicken."" His response reflects the operative attitude of the U.S.-Israel coalition to Palestinian rights. In the region, there is great skepticism about Washington's current revival of the ""peace process."" It is not hard to see why.","Noam Chomsky: Israel will continue its current policies with U.S. support .

"A police dog died of heat stroke after being left in a patrol car in Woodstock, Georgia, authorities said Tuesday. The 3-year-old dog, a Belgian Malinois named Spartacus, was found dead Monday night inside the K-9 handler's car, which was parked outside his home, Brittany Duncan, a Woodstock Police Department spokeswoman, said in a written statement. A necropsy requested by the police department determined the cause of death was heat stroke, the statement said. The statement did not detail why the car was parked at the handler's house nor did it say how long it had been parked there. ""The K9 handler is currently on administrative leave with pay pending the outcome of an internal investigation,"" Duncan said. The police department did not publicly identify Spartacus' handler, describing him only as a 9-year police veteran who has worked as a K-9 handler for seven of those years. ""After the retirement of his first police K-9, who is now a family pet living with the K-9 handler, the handler is devastated by the loss of his second police K-9,"" Duncan said. Spartacus was cross-trained in drug detection, tracking and apprehension, according to the department. A memorial service for Spartacus will be announced at a later date, Duncan said.","Spartacus was a 3-year-old Belgian Malinois at the Woodstock Police Department .

"A Florida judge on Tuesday set bail for George Zimmerman at $9,000 and ordered a number of conditions for his freedom -- including that he not possess weapons -- while he awaits trial on charges he pointed a shotgun at his girlfriend. He was released from the John E. Polk Correctional Facility on Tuesday afternoon. He didn't speak with the media. It was unclear where he was headed. Zimmerman was arrested Monday at his girlfriend's Apopka home, four months after he was acquitted of murdering teenager Trayvon Martin. Earlier, Zimmerman said little as a judge, during Zimmerman's first appearance Tuesday afternoon in Seminole County court, said he found probable cause for Zimmerman's arrest on a felony charge of aggravated assault and misdemeanor counts of domestic violence battery and criminal mischief. Zimmerman's arraignment has been scheduled for January 7. A prosecutor revealed a new allegation against Zimmerman while trying to argue for a higher bail -- that Zimmerman tried to choke his girlfriend a week and a half before Monday's alleged shotgun incident, and that Zimmerman had talked about suicide. Assistant State Attorney Lymary Munoz argued for $50,000 bail, saying that new information should heighten concern for the accuser's safety, though the alleged incident hadn't been reported to police. The new allegation is not reflected in the preliminary charges. But Judge Fred Schott cited the choking accusation when he put the bail at $9,000, saying it prompted him to set it higher than the $4,900 requested by the defense. Jeff Dowdy and Daniel Megaro, the public defenders representing Zimmerman, told reporters afterward that they hadn't known of the choking allegation previously. ""That was news to us,"" Dowdy said. ""... That was not contained in the arrest report, and that's the first we've heard about it."" Schott put conditions on Zimmerman's bail: That he cannot go to two Florida addresses; he cannot have contact with the accuser, Samantha Scheibe; he cannot possess weapons; he must wear a monitoring device; and he cannot travel outside Florida. The judge initially said Zimmerman could return to one of the banned addresses with law enforcement to retrieve his belongings, but later -- at Munoz's urging -- revsersed that allowance, saying a third party could get the belongings instead. Megaro told reporters he was confident Zimmerman would be acquitted. ""He's maintained his innocence, I'll tell you that,"" Dowdy said . Megaro was asked about Scheibe's alleged claims that Zimmerman talked about suicide. ""He's back in jail. Obviously that causes a certain amount of anxiety and stress on somebody. I would not characterize him as what the state attorney has said, meaning he's suicidal and volatile. We did not get that impression from him,"" Megaro said. Zimmerman's public defenders said Tuesday they were appointed to the case because Zimmerman said he couldn't afford an attorney. He is unemployed, according to a police report, and has about $150 to his name with debts of $2.5 million, according to his request for a public defender. Frank Taaffe told HLN's ""Nancy Grace"" that he paid the bond for his friend. Zimmerman claims dispute arose over alleged pregnancy . Zimmerman was arrested Monday afternoon at Scheibe's Apopka home after she called 911, said Dennis Lemma, chief deputy with the Seminole County Sheriff's Office. Zimmerman told police the argument erupted after he tried to leave because Scheibe was pregnant and wanted to raise their child by herself, though police say Scheibe disputed the account. ""She told me it was better if we co-parented and she raised the child on her own,"" Zimmerman said to a 911 dispatcher in a separate call. ""I said, 'Are you sure this is what you want to do?' She said, 'Yes.'"" Zimmerman continued, ""As soon as I started packing up my stuff to leave, she just completely changed."" Asked to elaborate, Zimmerman said he wanted to leave amicably, but Scheibe ""just started smashing stuff, taking stuff that belonged to me and throwing it outside, throwing it out of her room, throwing it all over the place. ""I guess she thought I was going to argue with her, but she's pregnant. I'm not going to put her through that type of stress."" In a question-and-answer session after Monday's news conference, Lemma told reporters, ""At this time, the victim has disclosed to us that she is not pregnant."" Differing 911 calls . According to a police report about the incident, Scheibe said that after an argument, Zimmerman broke a table with a shotgun and then pointed it at her ""for a minute."" Scheibe called 911 at 12:30 p.m. ET, Lemma said. On a 911 call recording released by police, a woman can be heard telling authorities: ""He's inside my house breaking all my (things) because I asked him to leave."" The woman then says to someone at the house, ""I'm doing this again? You just broke my glass table. You just broke my sunglasses and you put your gun in my freaking face and told me to get the (expletive) out."" A man is heard telling her to calm down, but then she tells the dispatcher that the man just pushed her out of the house and locked the door. In his 911 call, Zimmerman says that his girlfriend was, ""for lack of a better term, going crazy on me"" and throwing his things out. He says the woman is outside with police. Asked why he is calling, Zimmerman says, ""I just want everyone to know the truth."" He says he never pulled a firearm and that it is in a bag, locked. He says she was the one who broke the table. When deputies arrived at the house, Scheibe gave them a key. When they pushed open the door -- which was blocked by several small pieces of furniture -- they found Zimmerman, who was sitting and unarmed, Lemma said. He was passive and cooperative, Lemma said. The sheriff's office was seeking a search warrant to look for two guns deputies believed were inside the home, he said. According to the police report, Zimmerman had locked up the guns before police arrived. Zimmerman's wife has doubts about his innocence . Scheibe 'in a safe place,' mother says . Scheibe's mother, Hope Scheibe, said on Monday, ""My daughter is doing good, and she's in a safe place."" Scheibe and Zimmerman have been friends for 11 years, and Zimmerman has been living with her for the past several months, her mother said. Zimmerman's estranged wife, Shellie Zimmerman, filed for divorce on September 5 and the papers were served Monday night while he was in jail. Shellie Zimmerman's attorney, Kelly Sims, said it was the first opportunity to give him the documents. Days after the filing, Shellie Zimmerman called 911 and alleged that her husband had threatened her -- one of several brushes that George Zimmerman has had with law enforcement since he was acquitted in July of murder and manslaughter in the 2012 shooting death of teenager Trayvon Martin. Recent contact with authorities . Police detained George Zimmerman on September 9 after his estranged wife told a 911 dispatcher that he had threatened her and her father at her father's house in Lake Mary, Florida. But earlier this month, Lake Mary police said no charges would be filed, saying there was insufficient evidence to prosecute the case. In late September, Shellie Zimmerman told NBC's Matt Lauer on the ""Today"" show that she had doubts about her husband's innocence in the Martin case. Zimmerman also has been stopped for speeding twice since his July acquittal. He was pulled over the first time in Forney, Texas, in July and told the police officer he had a concealed weapon permit and a gun in his glove compartment. The officer wrote on his incident report that he gave Zimmerman a verbal warning. Zimmerman was pulled over in early September going 60 mph in a 45-mph zone in Lake Mary and received a $256 ticket. He was not carrying a weapon at the time. National headlines . Zimmerman fatally shot Martin in the Sanford neighborhood where Zimmerman and Martin's father lived in February 2012. Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, had a confrontation with the unarmed African-American teen after calling police to report a suspicious person, and he said he shot Martin, 17, in self-defense. Zimmerman was acquitted by a six-person jury in July on second-degree murder and manslaughter charges. The high-profile case sparked a heated nationwide discussion of race as well as debate over Florida's ""stand your ground"" law. On Tuesday, the Martin family released a statement through attorney Benjamin Crump. ""We, like many others, are watching these latest proceedings against a man who killed our son with a keen interest, however, we're more focused on the Trayvon Martin Foundation and defining his legacy,"" the statement read. In an interview with The Washington Post, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said the Department of Justice will announce a decision ""relatively soon"" on whether Zimmerman should face civil rights charges.","A friend of George Zimmerman tells HLN's Nancy Grace that he paid the bail .

The smartphone was released prior to the company's latest results, which showed sales slumped 40% in its most recent quarter. However, losses were less than Wall Street expected and shares rose slightly. Marty Beard, BlackBerry's chief operating officer, told CNN the smartphone's 4.5-inch square screen was ""optimal for reading complex documents, looking at images, looking at, for example, a PowerPoint."" He added, ""it's a beautiful screen that allows you, again, to be very productive."" Blackberry's share price slumped around 95% between 2008 and 2012 and has remained relatively flat since then. The Passport, key to turnaround plans, will cost $599 and targets BlackBerry's core business customers. According to Beard, BlackBerry can compete with high-fliers like Apple through its focus on users that need to be ""highly productive and very effective and are concerned about security and just getting a lot done securely."" Beard also points to the smartphone's keyboard, a feature BlackBerry has long used to differentiate itself from the competition. The Passport has a physical and virtual keyboard, which he said ""combined the best of both worlds and created this incredible keyboard which allows you to move very quickly, be very productive and get around content really easily.""

"After Tuesday's shooting at an Oregon high school, many media outlets, including CNN, reported that there have been 74 school shootings in the past 18 months. That's the time period since the December 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, where 20 children and six adults were shot to death. The statistic came from a group called Everytown for Gun Safety, an umbrella group started by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a passionate and public advocate of gun control. Without a doubt, that number is startling. So on Wednesday, CNN took a closer look at the list, delving into the circumstances of each incident Everytown included. Everytown says on its web site that it gleans its information from media reports and that its list includes school shootings involving a firearm discharged inside or on school grounds, including assaults, homicides, suicides and accidental shootings. CNN determined that 15 of the incidents Everytown included were situations similar to the violence in Newtown or Oregon -- a minor or adult actively shooting inside or near a school.  That works out to about one such shooting every five weeks, a startling figure in its own right. Some of the other incidents on Everytown's list included personal arguments, accidents and alleged gang activities and drug deals. Here are the 15 Newtown-like incidents that have occurred between the Sandy Hook massacre and the latest shooting in Oregon: . 1. January 10, 2013 -- Taft Union High School in Taft, California: A 16-year-old student opened fire in class. He was targeting two classmates who he felt had bullied him, law enforcement said. One student was injured. The shooter was placed into custody after a teacher and campus supervisor persuaded the student to put down his firearm. 2. January 15, 2013 --  Stevens Institute of Business and Arts in St. Louis, Missouri: A part-time student shot and injured a school employee then apparently shot himself, according to St. Louis police. 3. January 31, 2013 -- Price Middle School in Atlanta, Georgia: A 14-year-old was shot in the head outside his school, police said. His mother told CNN affiliate WSB-TV that he was taken to the hospital. Atlanta Public Schools announced that another student had been taken into custody after the 1:50 p.m. shooting. 4. April 12, 2013 -- New River Community College in Christianburg, Virginia: An 18-year-old student drove to the school's campus inside a mall and began shooting at 1:55 p.m. on a Friday, police said. He wounded two women. 5. June 7, 2013 -- Santa Monica College in Santa Monica, California: A gunman killed four people during a rampage that began at a home near the college campus, police said. He opened fire in the residence where police discovered two bodies, then the gunman shot at a passing car and carjacked another. The gunman forced the driver to drive onto the campus and shot two people in a passing vehicle, police said. Another victim was shot outside the campus library, authorities said. The gunman was killed by authorities. 6. August 20, 2013 -- Ronald E. McNair Discovery Learning Academy, in Decatur, Georgia: A gunman fired shots and barricaded himself inside the elementary school. Antoinette Tuff, who worked in the front office, was hailed as a hero for engaging suspect Michael Brandon Hill. She managed to talk him into into giving up, and no one was injured, police said. 7. August 30, 2013 --  Carver High School in Winston-Salem, North Carolina: A student injured another during a shooting that occurred at 2:45 p.m. during a planned fire drill, CNN affiliate WXII reported. 8. October 21, 2013 -- Sparks Middle School in Sparks, Nevada: A 12-year-old opened fire with a handgun he took from his parents, police say. Jose Reyes injured two students and killed Mike Landsberry, a teacher and Afghanistan war veteran, authorities said. Reyes killed himself. 9. December 13, 2013 --  Arapahoe High School in Centennial, Colorado: Karl Halverson Pierson opened fire on a Friday inside his suburban Denver high school, police said. The 18-year-old allegedly shot Claire Davis, a 17-year-old senior, who later died at a hospital. Law enforcement said that Pierson apparently wanted revenge against a faculty member because of a ""confrontation or disagreement."" 10. January 9, 2014 --  Liberty Technology Magnet High School in Jackson, Tennessee: A 16-year-old student shot . a classmate in the leg as classes were being dismissed for the day, police said, according to CNN affiliate WBBJ. The student was treated for his gunshot wound, WBBJ said. 11. January 14, 2014 --  Berrendo Middle School in Roswell, New Mexico: A 12-year-old boy walked into the school gym, pulled a shotgun out of a bag and fired at students waiting for the school day to begin, authorities said. The boy wounded two. 12. January 21, 2014 -- Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana: Student Cody M. Cousins, 23, opened fire in the basement of the Electrical Engineering Building, according to the university. Cousins allegedly killed Andrew F. Boldt, the school said, and both were listed as seniors. The school's police chief said that Cousins left the building right after the shooting, and a city police officer arrested him. Cousins was ""booked on a preliminary charge of murder,"" Purdue Police Chief John Cox said. 13. January 24, 2014 -- South Carolina State University in Orangeburg, South Carolina: A manhunt kicked off after a student Brandon Robinson, 20, was shot to death at the school, authorities said.

Rodger committed suicide, leaving behind a long, hateful essay. 15. June 5, 2014 -- Seattle Pacific University in Seattle, Washington: A 26-year-old man who was not a student at the school was tackled by a student security guard after he killed one person and wounded two others, police said. Once the suspect was on the ground, other students jumped on top of him, according to authorities. Police told CNN affiliate KIRO that Aaron Ybarra was fascinated with school shootings and told investigators he had visited Colorado's Columbine High School where two students killed 12 students and a teacher in 1999.","CNN examined Everytown for Gun Safety's list of school shootings .

He co-founded the Steppenwolf Theater Company in Chicago. Actor Gary Sinise says we can't do enough for veterans who sacrifice to protect America. (CNN) -- A while back, a friend of mine suggested that I take a look at a film that a buddy of his had made about his two brothers serving in Iraq. Having spent some time there myself, I was eager to see it. Once I did, I wanted to do all I could to help the filmmakers find a distributor and get this wonderful film into the theaters. I was honored to be asked to come on board as executive producer of the film, ""Brothers at War,"" an honest and inside look at our military service members. It's told through the point of view of one brother who is in search of answers as to why his two younger brothers are serving in Iraq and what they and their families are doing during these long deployments. I got involved with the film ""Brothers at War"" because I believe it shows a side of our military that is rarely seen. The call to duty that many of our military members share is depicted in the film through Isaac and Joe Rademacher. They are the two brothers who Jake Rademacher, the filmmaker, travels to Iraq to see in order to experience for himself why they serve and what they are doing while deployed away from their families in this dangerous environment. It makes me proud to know we have such men and women willing to give so much in defense of our nation. I felt compelled to support this film because, on the many tours I have been on in support of our troops, I have met so many service members like the two Rademacher brothers in the film. Isaac and Joe are military men. They are both called to serve their country and have endured great hardship. Yet they continue to serve and to serve honorably. And through them, Jake is introduced to other members of the service -- soldiers serving on the Syrian border and Marines training an Iraqi platoon. Jake takes his camera into the middle of a firefight where the Iraqi troops are ambushed and fight back. This footage is unlike anything we have ever seen -- an Iraqi unit fighting back and standing up to a terrorist attack and the pride that their Marine mentors have in them. It is quite moving, and Jake Rademacher captures it all. Several members of my family have served our country. My father, Robert, served in the Navy in the early 1950s. My Uncle Jack was a navigator on a B17 Flying Fortress during WWII. My Uncle Jerry served in the Pacific during WWII and my grandfather Daniel Sinise was in the Army in WWI. My wife's two brothers served in Vietnam and my wife's sister served for 10 years in the Army. Her husband, Jack, served as a medic in Vietnam. While serving there he wore his dog tags on a rosary with a St. Christopher medal. I wore that same rosary and dog tags as my character, ""Lt. Dan,"" in the movie ""Forrest Gump."" I remember all too well what it was like for our returning military members during the Vietnam conflict. They were caught in the middle of a very divided nation and not only did they have to endure the scars of battle, but upon their return they also were spit on and shamed and ridiculed for their service. Some decided to take off their uniforms in the airport bathrooms when they arrived home so as not to be identified with serving in Vietnam. We can never let that happen again to these men and women who serve this country. They should be able to wear their uniforms proudly. They fight and sacrifice in ways that very few of us can imagine. Many years ago I got involved with Vietnam veteran support groups in the Chicago, Illinois, area. After September 11, 2001, once we started deploying our troops to Afghanistan and Iraq, I began a mission to let them know that they are supported and that there are people out there who are grateful for their service. For over 35 years, we have had an all-volunteer military. This is a good thing. We want people to serve this country who want to be there and who do it of their own free will -- not because they are drafted and forced into it. We are lucky we have such people. What would we do if no one wanted to serve to defend the freedoms we all enjoy? And so, I feel the need to do what I can to thank them for that service in order to help keep them strong in tough times. You would be amazed at what a simple thank you will do. I have been to Iraq four times now, Afghanistan once, and many many other places as well, all to show support of our troops. My goal is always to cover as many miles as possible and to take pictures, sign autographs and shake hands with as many troops as I can in the time I have. Trips have included bases in Kuwait, Qatar, UAE, Bahrain and in Iraq -- Al Asad, Al Qaim, Ramadi , Habbaniyah, TQ airbase, Mosul, Balad, Tikrit and Baghdad. Over the last six years, I have traveled around the world and all over the United States with the USO to visit and perform with my band, The Lt. Dan band, for our troops. I have supported many grassroots troop support efforts as well, and visited our wounded in the hospitals several times. I could not be more honored to play a small part in helping our troops and their families. We can never do enough for our veterans who have sacrificed so much to keep this nation free. But we can always try to do more. It is my goal to continue to visit our troops, wherever they may serve. It is the least I can do for the men and women who continue to do so much for our country.

"With all due respect, thanks but no thanks. That's the message from the Children's Hospital Los Angeles after it was deluged with pizzas. It started all when Lauren Hammersley taped a message to the hospital room window of her 2-year-old daughter Hazel, a cancer patient. ""Send Pizza. RM 4112."" On Saturday, a Reddit user took a picture of the window from the street. And word spread. Fast. Reddit users, who have a longstanding mission to ""restore faith in humanity, one slice at a time"" with their ""Random Acts of Pizza,"" delivered. Study: Reddit used by 6% of adult Internet users . They leapt in to action for Hazel Hammersley. One pizza arrived. Then another. And another. By the time more than 20 pizzas had been delivered, the hospital had to issue a statement on their website, urging everyone to stop. ""You've made a little girl very happy but NO MORE PIZZA IS NEEDED,"" the hospital said. ""The Hammersley family will be going to bed very full and very thankful for the compassion they received today."" Hazel was diagnosed in April with Stage 3 neuroblastoma, a type of cancer found predominantly in young children and infants. She will soon begin her fifth round of chemotherapy treatment. On her blog ""Our Little Hazelnut,"" mother Lauren Hammersley wrote: ""We have been absolutely humbled and surprised by the outpouring of love and support from the online community and can only hope and pray that this brings awareness to Neuroblastoma and the Childhood Cancer Community."" She also said the family was able to share in the fun with other families in their ward. ""Several other children and nurses came into the room, with music playing, and had themselves a wonderful Pizza Party,"" she said. It was a sight that melted hearts like mozzarella.

"Police in North Carolina shot and killed a man running toward them Saturday morning -- but he may have just been looking for help after a car wreck. Officers responded to a ""breaking and entering"" 911 call at a home in Charlotte. The homeowner told dispatchers that a man had been knocking on her door repeatedly. Police say that when they got to the scene, a man matching the caller's description ran toward them. One of the officers fired his stun gun, but it was ""unsuccessful."" Another officer then opened fire, police said. Jonathan Ferrell died at the scene. He was shot several times. He was unarmed. Police now believe Ferrell was seeking assistance after crashing his car. Florida man mistakenly shot by deputies . The crash . Ferrell was 24 and a former football player at Florida A&M University. Police found a wrecked car nearby, indicating that he may have been trying to get help. ""It was a pretty serious accident,"" Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Rodney Monroe told CNN affiliate WSOC. The crash was so severe that authorities now believe Ferrell had to climb out of the back window, affiliate WBTV reported. He ran to the closest house for help. The woman inside thought it was her husband. ""To her surprise, it was an individual that she did not know or recognize,""  Monroe told WBTV. ""She immediately closed the door, hit her panic alarm, called 911."" The man stood outside and ""continued to attempt to gain the attention of the homeowner,"" a police statement said. The shooting . Police have charged Officer Randall Kerrick with voluntary manslaughter -- a felony. He turned himself in Saturday afternoon and was released Sunday on $50,000 bond. Police used ""charged"" and ""ran"" and ""advanced"" in their description of what Ferrell did. There were three officers at the scene, but Kerrick was the only one to use a gun. He fired several times, police said. ""The evidence revealed that Mr. Ferrell did advance on Officer Kerrick and the investigation showed that the subsequent shooting of Mr. Ferrell was excessive,"" police said in another statement issued late Saturday night. ""Our investigation has shown that Officer Kerrick did not have a lawful right to discharge his weapon during this encounter. "" All three officers have been placed on paid leave. A charge of voluntary manslaughter means the person used excessive force in self-defense, or carried out the act without intent to kill. Police called the incident ""unfortunate."" ""It has devastated a family as well as caused a great deal of sadness and anxiety in our organization,"" a statement said. Kerrick's first court appearance is scheduled for Monday at 1:30 p.m., the Mecklenburg County District Attorney's Office said. ""In every case, the District Attorney's Office evaluates the evidence available and works to achieve a fair and just outcome,"" the office said in a statement. Times Square shooting: Police wound 2 bystanders by mistake . The reaction . Friends expressed grief on social media, calling Ferrell a ""brother"" and demanding ""justice."" He had at least one brother, Willie, who played with him at Florida A&M. The university said it was ""deeply saddened"" at the loss. In a statement, Michael Smith, interim athletic director, said Ferrell played safety and was part of the 2010 championship team. ""Our hearts and prayers go out to his family during their time of bereavement,"" Smith said. Ferrell was engaged. ""We loved him. Our family loved him,"" his fiancee's mother told WSOC. He would have turned 25 next month.","The officer charged in the killing was released from jail .

"All you might feel is someone brush by you and a slight pin prick. But very quickly you would be suffering muscle paralysis followed by suffocation. You would be dead within a very short period of time. This is the deadly effect of just one of the weapons found on a failed North Korean assassin last year on the busy streets of Seoul, now shown exclusively to CNN. Disguised to look like a Parker ballpoint pen, it contains a poison needle and is practically impossible to identify as a weapon. The second pen shoots a poison-filled bullet which penetrates the skin and releases the toxin and the third weapon is a flashlight, loaded with up to three bullets. They all look completely innocuous but all three will kill. An individual willing to be identified only as an ""investigation official"" showed CNN the weapons, pointing out the flashlight as the most significant find. ""This flashlight is new,"" the man familiar with North Korean assassination devices said. ""I've never seen this weapon.  If you look at the front, there are three holes, there was a bullet in each hole and here is the trigger.  This is currently loaded and dangerous, two bullets remain."" The third bullet had been fired by investigation authorities to test the weapon. It was accurate and deadly. The would-be assassin who was carrying these devices was arrested on his way to kill his target. That target was anti-North Korea activist, Park Sang-hak, who has since been given round-the-clock police protection by South Korean authorities. We showed Park the footage of the weapons intended for him. He was shocked. ""You'd notice a gun, but these weapons are so innocuous, you can easily kill someone, I'd be dead immediately."" Park says he will continue to send anti-Pyongyang propaganda leaflets across the border in balloons, a practice which has angered the regime, sparking threats of military retaliation. He was aware he was at the top of North Korea's hit list. Park had been in contact with the would-be assassin, named only as Ahn, as Ahn had expressed interest in funding his activism.  He was on his way to meet him when the National Intelligence Service intervened and stopped him. It was at that meeting Ahn was believed to have planned to kill Park, according to South Korean authorities. Ahn was convicted in April and sentenced to four years in prison. ""I didn't believe they'd try and kill me on the crowded streets of Seoul, I thought the NIS was over-reacting,"" Park said. He now knows they saved his life but is also convinced that it will not be the last attempt on his life.","Poison-tipped ballpoint pen and pen firing poison bullets found on failed N.

"An e-mail from a Georgia Tech fraternity member to his Phi Kappa Tau brothers came to light this week. It was about how to ""succeed at parties,"" or more specifically ""luring your rapebait."" It came with repulsively detailed instructions about how to scope out a target, weaken her defenses with alcohol, grab her and -- you get the idea. You can expect well-meaning commentators and bloggers to wonder how such a horrible man could have done such a thing, much less have gotten into a good college. Others will wonder why one fraternity's culture would be so toxic. University officials will go into damage-control mode, noting how they hold students accountable for violations of policy and that they have an otherwise low rate of rape on their campus. They may say, well, this was just an e-mail. Sadly, it's all so predictable. The ""rapebait"" e-mail could have been sent from almost any fraternity at almost any American college or university.  A study I published in 2007 with my colleagues Jerry Tatum and J.T. Newberry found that fraternity men were three times more likely to commit rape than other men on college campuses. It was the third study showing that fraternity men are three times more likely to rape. Opinion: We can counter ""rapebait"" culture . The definition of ""success"" in the e-mail sounds eerily similar to what David Lisak identifies as rape in his research on profiling ""undetected rapists"" -- college men who have committed rape and/or attempted rape, an average of six times each, but are never reported and never are held accountable for their crimes. What was particularly remarkable about our study is that we found that it was the fraternity experience that led men to be more likely to rape. We traced entering freshmen from the time they got to campus through their first year of college. We asked them whether they committed acts of sexual violence before they got to college (many had). We then compared the rates of sexual assault among men who joined fraternities to the rates of sexual assault among men who did not join fraternities. In 2011: Vermont fraternity chapter closed over rape survey . What we found was highly instructive. Before they got to college, fraternity men were no different from other male students. They committed the same number of incidents of sexual assaults before college. But here's the difference. Guys who joined a fraternity then committed three times as many sexual assaults as those who didn't join. It is reasonable to conclude that fraternities turn men into guys more likely to rape. Our study confirmed that fraternities provide the culture of male peer support for violence against women that permits bad attitudes to become treacherous behavior. And that should concern everyone. We need more action. Opinion: Why don't some boys see it as rape? There are a lot of us across the country who have worked for decades trying to prevent rape on college campuses. Many experience high levels of frustration at the lack of commitment on the part of colleges and universities to face the issue. Rarely does a college discuss sexual assault with its students for more than 60 minutes in an entire college career, if they do at all. There are many great approaches to prevention. In our case at One in Four, we have spent the last 20 years refining an intervention that lasts for one hour called the Men's Program. Our research, published in peer-reviewed journals, shows that when fraternity men see it, 40% fewer sexual assault incidents occur. One would think that national fraternities would embrace such an approach to educating their members. Sadly, when given numerous opportunities to do so, they prefer to pretend they aren't responsible. Though there are a few universities that are beginning to do more comprehensive prevention programming, they are the exception. We know that prevention programming can help a great deal. We just need to make it a priority. How difficult is that?","John Foubert: Georgia Tech frat member sent e-mail to brothers on ""luring your rapebait""

"Egypt's outgoing interim president issued a decree criminalizing sexual harassment to combat the widespread abuse of women in the country, a spokesman said Friday. President Adly Mansour issued the country's first law that explicitly uses the term ""sexual harassment,"" a statement from his office reads. The law makes the offense punishable by up to five years in prison and a maximum fine of 50,000 Egyptian pounds. The decree starts with a baseline prohibition, making it illegal to accost people by ""implying sexual or obscene gestures"" in any manner, ""including modern means of communication."" Absent any aggravating factor, the crime is punishable by at least six months of detention. If the harassment is made with ""the intent of receiving sexual gratification from the victim,"" the minimum detention rises to one year. And if the offender holds ""a position of authority over the victim,"" whether social or professional, the minimum imprisonment is two years, the law reads. A 2013 United Nations report entitled ""Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women"" found that 99.3% of Egyptian women have experienced some form of sexual harassment. Fathi Farid, a founder of Egypt's ""I Saw Harassment"" campaign against sexual violence, said the law ""is a first step in the right direction, but we believe that a revision is needed to strengthen the decree."" Farid cited a lack of protection for eyewitnesses, judicial discretion in issuing punishment, and inadequate protection against gang assaults as points of weakness for the law. Still, Farid said the law ""will give women greater trust in the government and encourage victims that may have been afraid in the past to file complaints to the police against perpetrators."" He added that it will take time to assess whether the law will actually be applied by authorities. Former Egyptian military chief Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is due to succeed Mansour after winning last month's presidential election. Mansour was declared the acting president after the ouster of Mohamed Morsy last July.","Law makes it illegal to accost people by ""implying sexual or obscene gestures""

"I'm an American-Muslim and I despise Islamic terrorists.  In fact, despise is not even a strong enough word to convey my true feelings about those who kill innocent people in the name of Islam. I hate them with every fiber of my being. I'm not going to tell you, ""Islam is a religion of peace.""  Nor will I tell you that Islam is a religion of violence.  What I will say is that Islam is a religion that, like Christianity and Judaism,  is intended to bring you closer to God.  And sadly we have seen people use the name of each of these Abrahamic faiths to wage and justify violence. The unique problem for Muslims is that our faith is being increasingly defined by the actions of a tiny group of morally bankrupt terrorists. Just to be clear: The people who commit violence in the name of Islam are not Muslims, they are murderers. Their true religion is hatred and inhumanity. The only people terrorists speak for are themselves and the others involved in their despicable plot. They do not represent me, my family or any other Muslim I know. And believe me, I know a lot of Muslims. We hate these terrorists more than non-Muslims do. How can I say that? Because they harm innocent people in the name of our religion and consequently we suffer a backlash because of their acts.  It can be anything from a spike in hate crimes to people viewing Muslims as less than fully American because of our faith.  We are the ones called to answer for the sins of people we detest. Since the Boston bombing has renewed for some concerns about Muslims, I wanted to candidly answer three questions I have been asked repeatedly over the years: . 1. Why do some Muslims commit terrorism? I'm not a terrorism expert but I will share the view of those I have spoken to in the Muslim community.  There can be no doubt that some Muslims wrongly believe that their terrorist act is sanctioned by Islam. But to us their true motivation is not religious, but rather political. Islam is simply used by terrorists as a way to recruit support.They then engage in terrorism to bring attention to their grievances or to achieve their political agenda, just as other terror groups have done in the past. The recent statement of the Islamic militant group in the Caucasus region denying involvement in the Boston bombing makes this very point. They expressly tell us that they have a specific political agenda: ""The Caucasian Mujahideen are not fighting against the United States of America. We are at war with Russia, which is not only responsible for the occupation of the Caucasus, but also for heinous crimes against Muslims."" 2. Why don't Muslims denounce terrorism? Just to be clear: American Muslims and U.S. Muslim organizations have unequivocally denounced terror attacks. Not just once, but over and over. But that doesn't matter if you haven't heard it.  And despite our best efforts to get this message out there, what attracts more media attention: A Muslim denouncing terrorism or footage of an explosion? Does that mean that we will stop denouncing terrorism? Of course not. But we will have to be more creative in our efforts to attract media coverage to make this point to our fellow Americans. 3. Why don't Muslims stop blowing stuff up? I have never blown up anything, except maybe a model toy tank when I was a kid. Nor has any other Muslims I've met in person or even on Facebook.  But still we are charged by many with the task of policing a religion of more than a billion people. Although this may not change some people's perception, statistically Muslims have not been the ones involved in most terror plots in the United States. In fact, since 1995, 88% of the domestic terrorist plots have been by right-wing groups, ecoterrorists and anarchists, according to an analysis by the Center for American Progress. But still, 12% were Muslims. Believe me, we wish that number were zero. But here's the brutal truth: Neither law enforcement nor the American Muslim community can stop every radical or criminal who happens to be Muslim.  A ""lone wolf"" can devise his or her evil plan in secret, making detection almost impossible. But we are trying.  As L.A. County Sheriff Lee Baca testified before Congress in 2011, seven of the past 10 al Qaeda plots in the United States were foiled by tips from the American Muslim community. And just this past Sunday, NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly told CNN's Fareed Zakaria that his department has a strong working relationship with the New York City Muslim community. And it's not only American-Muslims working with law enforcement to stop radicals, but Canadians as well. Just this week we saw an Islamic terror plot prevented because of tips from the Canadian-Muslim community to law enforcement . It is my hope that in time, Muslims will not be defined to my fellow Americans by the handful of terrorists, but by the millions of others who are involved in all aspects of American life. Well-known American Muslims range from former NBA star Shaquille O'Neal, TV personality Dr. Oz,  U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison to police officers, teachers, judges, deli workers, cab drivers and the millions of American Muslims in between. These people, not the terrorists, are the true Muslims.","Dean Obeidallah says ""despise"" is not strong enough to convey how much he hates terrorism .
He says Islam is being wrongly defined by a tiny group of morally bankrupt terrorists .
American Muslims have denounced terror over and over, he says, but public hasn't heard .
Terrorists are motivated by politics, he says. Not one Muslim he knows supports terror ."
"The South Korean girls group Girls' Generation beat the likes of Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga and its compatriot Psy to win the top award for video of the year at the inaugural YouTube Music Awards. The K-pop group, which is one of Asia's biggest musical acts, won for the video ""I Got a Boy."" While massively popular in Asia, the reaction to its win from the American audience was muted -- with scattered applause, but mostly a long, deafening silence. Meet the 'YouTube famous' While Girls' Generation may be unknown to an American audience, the pop group is a national phenomenon in Korea. The group's record releases are a national event with every news outlet running stories and inciting fans to near-hysteria. The group might be likened to an Asian version of Spice Girls, with pop sounds, costumes and synchronized dancing. The members sing and also rap. The YouTube Music Awards nominees were based on views, likes and comments and subscriptions over the last 12 months and fans voted for the winners. The ""I Got a Boy"" video features the nine members in a pink house and then moves to the girls gyrating in front of random settings. They intermittently have random English lyrics, but mostly sing in Korean. It's not the group's first foray into the United States, as the ladies appeared on the ""Late Show with David Letterman"" and also ""Live! With Kelly"" last year. Artist of the Year went to rapper Eminem and the award ceremony, which was streamed live online, was hosted by actor Jason Schwartzman and musician Reggie Watts. The awards reflect the growing tendency for people to turn to the internet, rather than television or radio, for music and video. However, according to Variety magazine, at most 220,000 people watched the event online, a fraction of the 10.1 million who tuned in for the MTV Video and Music Awards in August.","South Korea's Girls' Generation wins year's best video at YouTube awards .

"From the first time you step into eastern Congo, you find yourself surrounded by the exotic and extraordinary, be it flora and fauna or the just plain incongruous -- the severed wing of a Russian aircraft stored on the side of the road, or a boy with a gun. The place is pulsating with the heat and energy of a population of people fighting to survive just one more day. But the violence here is as intense as this intoxicating, heady mix of Africa at its best and worst. Eastern Congo has been called the ""rape capital of the world"" by U.N. Special Representative Margot Wallstrom. Reports record that 48 women are raped every hour. I have been working in the region for 10 years and have seen a tragic development in this unpunished crime against the heart of society. I first went to a town called Shabunda, deep in the forest. It was October 2001 and circumstances brought me to Congo rather than Afghanistan. A small twin-engined plane was the only way in. And out. It was the height of the war and I was with a returning team from the medical NGO Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF). They had pulled out because of the regular attacks on the town, but had decided it was safe to bring their team of three back: there was such a need for medical help here. As the plane taxied its way precariously down the grass airstrip, we knew we were waving goodbye to the only escape route we had. I was there for a week. A week hearing terrifying stories of torture and rape. Multiple rapes. Violent, brutal rape. Rape with sticks and guns, even bayonets. Women told me of their daily choice -- to stay at home and face starvation. Or, go out to the fields for food and be raped. Most women chose the latter. It had become the norm. The war continued until 2003, when a peace treaty was signed. Officially, the fighting came to an end, but it didn't stop. Nor did the rape. I returned to Shabunda in 2005 to find the women I had interviewed and photograph four years earlier. It was an unsettling search, for most of those women had died or disappeared in the forest after an attack, never to be seen again. The new women I met had similar tales of horror. But there was a twist. The people I spoke to this time related organized rape camps, with daily roll-calls. There was a new efficiency in the rape, it had become an integrated part of the rebel forces lives. As these women told me, it was now systematic. Some years later, in 2009, I returned to make a film about rape and found a disturbing new trend. Women told me how they expected to be raped. Not once but many times. The women I met, spoke of gang rapes, three or four times. Sometimes it was ""only"" two soldiers, more often gangs of men,10, 20, over and over again. Many had conceived children and the girl children, some just babies only a few months old, were being raped as well. Rape has now become generational. In Panzi hospital, Bukavu, Dr. Mukwege, a general surgeon continues to work tirelessly to repair these damaged women. I met one of his patients. She was a cheerful little girl, it was impossible not to be drawn to her smile. The nurse saw me playing with her said: ""You know she's HIV-positive."" She was just three years old. Her twin sister had been killed when she and her mother had been raped. This little girl had been conceived from rape. It makes difficult reading, but not nearly as difficult as it is for the women survivors, who are living with the consequences and stigma of rape. Not least one particular woman, Masika Katsuva. She's tiny, barely five foot tall but is a giant of a personality. Her story has inspired many of us, it is so bleak but also hopeful because she's providing an answer to these women. The African beauty empowering women . Like so many women survivors, she too was rejected when she and her two teenage daughters were raped by militia men. Her husband was murdered in front of her, chopped up and she was forced to eat his private parts. Her two daughters Rachel and Yvette were 15 and 13 years old, and both of them conceived children. Masika's husband's family rejected them and she brought her daughters and their babies to a market town hugging the shore of Lake Kivu to try and rebuild their lives. This year I made a film about her and her work. She's taking care of 170 women at the moment, they call her Mama Masika. Over the past 10 years she's helped more than 6,000 victims of rape, providing them with a wide range of care -- practical, medical and psychological. She has created a community in an area that is not regularly attacked, providing support to anyone who wants it, and she uses a farm to bring them together. That field is their hope, their therapy and their source of food and income. They come to this refuge as victims, punished by the violation of rape, blamed and rejected by their families and the local community. Masika has become a mother figure to the women and their children -- the results of rape -- and as they plant, tend, harvest and finally sell their crops they begin to heal together. Masika tries to dream of a better future, but she's also realistic. She wants her women to be able to stop doing manual labor in the fields and learn skills like sewing. But for that to happen, she believes, the fighting and the rape must stop. She looks me in the eye, and with a sigh, says: ""But I don't see either the rape or the fighting ending today.""","Eastern Congo has been called the ""rape capital of the world""

"The lead that the presidential candidate of Honduras' ruling party has amassed during ballot-counting is ""irreversible,"" electoral officials said, but refrained from naming an official winner to Sunday's vote. The reluctance to definitively declare a winner speaks to the abundance of caution surrounding the electoral system, but also to the political tensions that have accompanied the vote. Already, two presidential candidates have claimed victory, and a third political party says it has data that suggests it came out on top. This was second presidential election (but the first truly robust one) since the 2009 coup of former President Jose Manuel Zelaya, which ushered in a period of political turmoil. With about two-thirds of ballots counted, ruling party candidate Juan Hernandez led with 34% of the vote, followed by 29% for Xiomara Castro, who is Zelaya's wife. ""These percentages, these trends, according to the calculations we have done, have not changed since the first day,"" said David Matamoros, president of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. ""So, today, we can tell the Honduran people that the final results will be the same as what we have today."" Matamoros called Hernandez's lead 'irreversible."" Castro's camp did not immediately comment on these latest results. Traditionally, Honduras has had a two-party system, alternating the presidency, but this year's ballot had eight candidates for president, half of whom were contenders. Following her husband's ouster from office, Castro founded the Liberty and Refoundation Party (LIBRE) on a platform that carried on her husband's projects and found herself at the top of some polls. A victory by Castro would have been a remarkable comeback for Zelaya back to the presidential palace, even as a first husband. In a race where the economy and public security were among the most important issues for voters, the final polls before the election showed a statistical tie between Hernandez and Castro. Sunday night, both leading candidates claimed victory: Castro announced her win on live television, while Hernandez did so on Twitter. LIBRE said earlier it does not recognize the preliminary results. ""To us, this does not reflect reality. There inconsistencies that have been detected, irregularities that have been found, we are collecting these,"" a party spokesman said Tuesday. A third leading party, the Liberal Party, also rejected the results, saying that hundreds of ballots are missing at that their own calculations show their party winning 26% of the vote to 25% of the vote for the other two leading contenders. 'There has to be order' With the inevitable confirmation of Hernandez as president-elect, all eyes are on the opposition parties and how they will react. In an interview with CNN en Español, Hernandez said that he has publicly invited Castro and the other candidates to dialogue about moving forward in a way that avoids conflict. ""There has to be order in the country,"" Hernandez said. ""There has to be respect and tolerance in the country, those are the rules."" The voter turnout, at more than 60%, was an encouraging sign in a country where faith in democracy has been thin at times. The country remains one of the poorest in the hemisphere and has one of the world's highest murder rates. Given these challenges, observers hope that political upheaval is added to the mix. If Castro does not concede, the alternative might be to allege fraud and to appeal the election through the electoral tribunal. Reports on whether Sunday's vote was free and fair are mixed. ""What we can say at this moment is that Sunday's election was very transparent,"" said Luis Sobalvarro, Honduras director of the International Foundation for Electoral Systems, a non-governmental organization. There were some irregularities, like in any election, he said, but nothing that could affect the results of the vote. Observers from the Organization of American States said Tuesday that the electoral process had been clean. ""The mission considers it important to emphasize that there were elements that contributed to the transparency of the process and therefore, give reliability to the preliminary results reported so far by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal,"" observer Enrique Correa told reporters. One international observer, Suyapa Portillo of Pitzer College in California, said she had recorded a number of irregularities. At one hotel where observers were staying, masked men with shirts labeled ""immigration"" emptied the place and checked everyone's identification, she said. ""It had an effect on the observers because it was an act of intimidation,"" she said. She said she also heard reports of immigration agents questioning the credentials of observers working for the opposition parties. The United States, which was criticized for being slow to condemn the 2009 coup, said in a statement that observers found the elections ""generally transparent."" ""The United States calls on Hondurans to await the completion of the counting of official results and to resolve election disputes peacefully through established legal processes,"" the State Department said. The potential for unrest and a showdown between presidential candidates has some observers upset. ""The Honduran citizenry has shown itself to be a first-rate citizenry, with second-rate politicians,"" political analyst Raul Pineda said.","Electoral officials say that Juan Hernandez is ahead in the vote count .
His lead at this point is ""irreversible,"" one says .
But Hernandez has not yet been named the official winner .
Political tensions have accompanied these elections ."
"The headline on the New York Post's cover Sunday about the kidnapping and killing of a Brooklyn man drew heavy criticism and left some calling for an apology from the newspaper known for being provocative. The cover featured a photo of Menachem Stark, 39, accompanied by the words, ""Who didn't want him dead?"" Stark was found dead in a trash bin Friday with several injuries to his body, Sgt. Lee Jones of the New York Police Department told CNN. Stark died of compression asphyxiation, which means someone or something pressed on his chest and lungs, suffocating him, a law enforcement source briefed on the investigation and autopsy told CNN Monday. There were also marks on his back consistent with him being tied up or otherwise restrained, the source said. Stark and his business partner own a real estate company called South Side Associates. The Post alleges that Stark owed thousands of dollars in penalties from dozens of Department of Building violations. The article also describes awful living conditions that his tenants allegedly endured. ""He pretty much ripped off the whole building,"" the post quoted Ryan Kuonen, a tenant organizer. Titled ""Slain slumlord found in trash has enemies list a mile long,"" the Post's article paints Stark, who was the landlord of dozens of buildings, as a shady character with questionable business dealings. Police are not commenting on these allegations. Stark's family, who is trying to make sense of the death, remembers the father of seven as a generous community man. ""It really hurts that such a heinous crime, instead of being condemned, is glorified,"" said Rabbi David Niederman, president of the United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburg and North Brooklyn. Niederman told CNN he does not know anything about Stark owing money or having legal problems. People may fall on hard times, but they work it out, he said. The Post is giving people a ""license to kill,"" Niederman added. Abraham Buxbaum, Stark's brother-in-law, calls the Post's reporting character assassination. The article included comments from anonymous law enforcement officials and tenants. ""I've had many conversations with him, and of course in many of those conversations, I wanted to kill him,""  the Post quoted Greg Hanlon, who lived in a Stark-owned building, as saying. Buxbaum, who is also a landlord, said it is impossible to keep all tenants happy. ""The question is what is the motive? The motive might be to sell as many copies as possible or it could be that he is Jewish and a lot of people don't like Jews. It makes you wonder,"" Buxbaum told CNN. Stark's family is offering a $25,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest. New York state Assemblyman Dov Hikind, who issued a statement on Sunday condemning the Post's reporting, said he was in ""absolute shock"" when he first read the article. It ""almost justifies his murder,"" added Hikind. ""The Post does not say Mr. Stark deserved to die, but our reporting showed that he had many enemies, which may have led to the commission of this terrible crime,"" said a Post spokeswoman in a statement. ""I think what everyone wants is a simple apology,"" said Hikind. The Brooklyn landlord was last seen on surveillance video on Thursday walking out of his office. He struggled with two individuals who forced him into a Dodge Caravan, according to a police statement. Stark was known to carry large amounts of money, the law enforcement source said. No motive has been established, and authorities are investigating possibilities, including his business dealings, the source said. Stark's body was found inside of a Long Island trash bin with burns to his torso and hands, and bruising to his head and neck, according to Jones. The case is under investigation.

"Kevin Wang always had the teaching bug in him. After graduating from UC-Berkeley in 2002 with a degree in electrical engineering and computer science, he turned down industry jobs to teach in the Bay Area. A few years later he got a masters degree in education from Harvard and then went to Microsoft to work as a software developer. But he couldn't stop teaching. Before he arrived at the office every morning, Wang drove to a nearby high school and taught first-period computer science. He told colleagues and friends about his experience and recruited them to teach in local schools. The word spread. In 2009 Wang launched Technology Education and Literacy in Schools (TEALS), an initiative that places high-tech professionals as part-time teachers in high schools. Wang's goal was to see to it that every high school in the country has a computer-science course. He thought he might need to quit his job to manage the growing effort. But he didn't have to. Microsoft offered to support Wang, asking him to devote all his workday time to it. The company's decision to incubate the TEALS program stems partly from founder Bill Gates's longstanding interest in promoting education, Microsoft's broader philanthropic focus and a pressing, industry-wide need for more engineers. ""America produces the best computer engineers in the world,"" said Wang, ""but we just don't have enough."" Which is why TEALS has over 100 volunteers covering 35 schools in seven states, and is now mounting a big push in New York City. Falling behind? In February of this year, Gates joined Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and other tech titans in a video by nonprofit Code.org to encourage interest among young people in programming.  Demand for top tech talent also has prompted the industry to lobby the State Department to give out more H1-B visas to highly skilled foreign-born immigrants. In April, Zuckerberg penned an op-ed in the Washington Post calling for revised immigration policies so that U.S. companies can better attract the most talented foreign-born computer scientists. Computer science is the third highest-paying bachelor degree, right behind computer engineering and chemical engineering. While the average starting salary for computer science college graduates is $64,400, industry insiders frequently cite higher figures. In large or competitive companies like Google or Facebook, starting salary for the cream of the crop college graduates is nearly $100,000, not counting bonuses or stock options. Despite the financial appeal, there aren't enough computer programmers entering the U.S. workforce to fill the estimated 150,000 new computing jobs that will be produced every year for the next decade. This adds to anxiety among industry professionals and policy leaders that the U.S. could fall behind other countries in innovation if it doesn't foster education in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math). Part of the problem is that the U.S. lacks enough computer science teachers, said Wang. Recent graduates with a computer science degree are far more likely to go into the tech industry, where offers are more lucrative. Early exposure to computer science can lead students to develop an aptitude or liking for the subject, apply for opportunities like tech internships, and pursue it as a career path. But even as technology becomes an integral part of most people's lives, fewer computer-science courses are being offered in high schools. Perhaps as a result, computer-science tests account for just 0.69% of all high school AP tests taken. And yet knowledge of computer programming is becoming more critical in the workplace. ""Computer science is permeating every industry and every field, and its importance will only grow,"" said Wang. ""Whether it's biology, finance, architecture, or a host of other disciplines, a basic computer literacy is critical."" TEALS in NYC . That the U.S. produces so few graduates in a field that will grow in importance makes the demand-supply problem only more urgent. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, never one to shy away from national issues, tried in 2011 to jumpstart the city's tech scene with the proposal to build a world-class engineering campus. When the mayor's office heard about TEALS after The New York Times ran an article about it in fall 2012, officials reached out to Wang and asked him to bring the program to New York City. With help from the mayor's Office, TEALS began setting up and recruiting volunteers. In March, Wang appeared at a New York tech meetup to invite the city's tech community to get involved. A plug from venture capitalist and blogger Fred Wilson also helped generate interest. Interviews with applicants, conducted jointly with nine participating high schools, started this month. Wang is curious to see how the composite of the volunteer force shapes up since few major technology companies are headquartered in New York City. Selected volunteers will go through an intensive training program in the summer so that they can use a standardized curriculum and learn how to manage classrooms by the fall. Since tech professionals often have flexible working hours, the program places them in first-period classes, which usually ends shortly after 9 a.m. Volunteers are paid a small stipend to cover transportation costs. But as Wang put it, ""No one is doing this for the money."" Jeff Tyson, a Microsoft employee, began teaching at a Seattle school last September and tries to appeal to students' creativity. ""If there is one thing we try to avoid in our class, it is (being) boring. We often try to show how deeply computer science has altered our world,"" he said. ""We even have some students who plan to code artistic projects. I think Steve Jobs was spot on when he called computer science a liberal art."" Bad numbers, big gains . About 80% of TEALS' volunteers are Microsoft employees, part of a push by the company to address the dearth of engineering talent in the U.S. The program is also part of the Microsoft YouthSpark initiative, which seeks to provide better access to education for young people worldwide. For Donald Hense, CEO and founder of the Friendship Public Charter Schools in the Washington, D.C., area, TEALS was a boon. ""We were excited that it could help us identify extremely qualified teachers to staff a very difficult field,"" he said. ""We specifically pushed for STEM courses in our schools. Kids are judged on ability, and the ability to code is going to help them a long way in tomorrow's world."" The numbers suggest Wang has an uphill battle. In 2012, only 61 students took advanced-placement computer science in the entire state of Utah, for example. In the nation's capital, it's the same number. But Wang is taking an optimistic view. ""The numbers are so bad that anything we can do is a huge, huge gain,"" he told CNN. Wang needs more students like Adrian Chavez, a senior taking a TEALS AP course at Hazen High School in Renton, Washington, who said, ""It is a dream of mine to someday work as a software engineer or programmer graphic artist in video games."" What would really help, Wang said, is if states recognized computer science as a core requirement rather than an elective. ""It really should be the fourth science course in high school, right beside biology, physics and chemistry,"" he said. ""If the next generation in this country is going to compete successfully for 21st-century jobs, they're going to need to know computer science.""","The TEALS program seeks to develop more computer-science students in the U.S.

"(CNN)In Mexico's male-dominated drug trade, her life story became a legend. Now, after more than seven years behind bars, the woman known as ""The Queen of the Pacific"" is free. A judge ruled in favor of her appeal last week, Mexico's Attorney General's Office said in a statement Saturday. Sandra Ávila Beltrán's story is the subject of a best-selling book and a popular ballad. She was first arrested in Mexico City on September 28, 2007, smiling before cameras as authorities trumpeted her detention. Later, Ávila made headlines when Mexican authorities said they were investigating a tip that she had received Botox treatments in prison. Ávila is the niece of Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo, founder of the now-defunct Guadalajara cartel. She's also related to drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, who was released from a Mexican prison in a controversial 2013 decision and now has a $5 million State Department bounty on his head. Mexico's case against her drew widespread attention as it made its way through the nation's courts. She was absolved of a money laundering charge in her first trial. In 2012, authorities extradited her to the United States, where she was accused of conspiring to smuggle cocaine along with Juan Diego Espinosa Ramirez, a Colombian national who was also known as ""The Tiger."" Ávila denied the charges. Authorities never convicted her of any drug-trafficking crimes, but prosecutors have said Ávila was once a key link in the drug trade between Colombia and Mexico. A 2008 U.S. congressional Research Service report described her as ""a senior member of the Sinaloa cartel who was instrumental"" in building ties with Colombian traffickers. In 2013, she pleaded guilty in a Florida court to a charge connected to the case, but U.S. prosecutors dropped the cocaine trafficking conspiracy charge. As part of the plea deal, Avila said she provided ""financial assistance for travel, lodging and other expenses"" to Espinosa from 2002 to 2004 ""with the intention of preventing or hindering his arrest for his drug trafficking crimes."" Later that year, she was deported back to Mexico. Last year, she was sentenced to five more years in prison and a fine for money laundering. But on Friday, a judge ruled that the conviction was not valid because she'd already been tried for the same crime in Mexico and the United States, Mexico's Attorney General's Office said. A popular ballad about Ávila sung by the band Los Tigres del Norte, titled ""The Queen of Queens,"" describes her 2007 arrest. ""The more beautiful the rose,"" one line in the song says, ""the sharper the thorns."" In an interview with Anderson Cooper that aired on ""60 Minutes"" and CNN in 2009, Ávila denied the charges against her and blamed Mexico's government for allowing drug trafficking to flourish. ""In Mexico there's a lot of corruption, a lot. Large shipments of drugs can come into the Mexican ports or airports without the authorities knowing about it. It's obvious and logical,"" she said. ""The government has to be involved in everything that is corrupt."" CNN's Claudia Dominguez contributed to this report.","Sandra Ávila Beltrán, known as ""The Queen of the Pacific,"" leaves prison .

"Washington (CNN)The race for the next U.S. president was evident on Tuesday night as plenty of potential Republican contenders criticizing President Barack Obama's tax proposals, while Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, defended the President's State of the Union address. Mitt Romney took to Facebook to argue that Obama was dismissing the message that voters sent to Washington when they voted for a Republican majority in November. Obama tax plan: Middle-class credits, increases for rich . ""He ignores the fact that the country has elected a Congress that favors smaller government and lower taxes,"" the 2012 Republican presidential nominee wrote. ""His tax proposal is a maze of new taxes and complexities."" In his speech, Obama called for closing loopholes in the tax code that he says leads ""to inequality by allowing the top 1% to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth."" The President is proposing a total of $235 billion in tax credits that are aimed to help the middle class. To pay for it, Obama wants tax investment income -- capital gains and dividends -- at a higher rate, which could help bring in $320 billion. As expected, Republicans widely panned the idea. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush acknowledged that some have benefited in the economic recovery but ""far too many people have been left behind."" ""It's unfortunate President Obama wants to use the tax code to divide us -- instead of proposing reforms to create economic opportunity for every American,"" he said on Facebook. ""We can do better."" Sen. Rand Paul, in his own taped response, said ""the President is redistributing the pie, but not growing it."" Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker blasted what he called Obama's ""top-down, government-knows-best philosophy."" ""Our American revival is not going to be led by a lame-duck president who would rather pick fights with Congress,"" he said in a statement. ""It will be led â€‹by reformers who know how to get things done."" Sen. Marco Rubio said in a statement that Obama's speech ""doubles down on outdated proposals to tax and spend more."" He also ripped into the President over his recent Cuba policy, saying it rewards ""repressive, anti-American regimes."" Joining ""Hambycast"" by phone, Rubio later tweaked Obama's pitch to make community college free. ""The single greatest impediment to community colleges today are not costs...it's the fact that at the end of that community college tunnel is that graduates don't see jobs,"" he told CNN's Peter Hamby. Separately, Rubio told CNN's Deirdre Walsh that he felt Republicans could work with Obama on some things, like increasing the child tax credit. ""I do think we have to focus on child care costs in America,"" he said. ""They are very high for working families."" Sen. Ted Cruz, in a statement criticizing Obama's speech, said, ""America saw a powerful demonstration that it is time to move on beyond President Barack Obama."" The Texas Republican posted a taped response earlier in the night on his YouTube page, but it was taken down. Reporters noted that Cruz appeared to mess up in the video and asked to start over. My friend, Joni . Many of the Republicans were quick to sing the praises of Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, who gave the Republican response, showing that it's never a bad move to praise the new senator from the state that holds the nation's first nominating contest. Bush said his ""friend Joni offered a great contrast,"" while Paul tweeted that his ""friend"" did a ""great job tonight."" Former Sen. Rick Santorum, who's spending five days in Iowa next week, also tweeted a shout-out: ""Good job @joniernst! Well delivered which drew a clear contrast."" Democrats jump to Obama's defense . Clinton, for her part, backed the President on Twitter, saying Obama pointed a way ""to an economy that works for all. Now we need to step up and deliver for the middle class."" The former secretary of state is considered the Democratic frontrunner if she runs for president. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said in a statement that Obama got it ""right"" and ""laid out ways we can create more opportunities for working families."" Outgoing Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley praised Obama's policies, saying in a statement, ""The worst thing we could do is let recent economic progress be undercut by Republican efforts to undo critically important financial reforms."" Some of the potential Republican contenders also criticized Obama's speech in real time. Paul, for example, jabbed Obama's push for free community college with multiple tweets. Paul's Facebook account also set up a fact-check game where players could guess whether statements in Obama's previous addresses were ""true"" or ""not so fast..."" Santorum said a line that he agreed with was the idea that ""we want people to not only share in America's success but contribute to its success."" On the Democratic side, former Sen. Jim Webb, who's announced a presidential exploratory committee, live-tweeted his thoughts during the speech. CNN's Steve Brusk, Terence Burlij, Dan Merica, Betsy Klein, and Alexandre Jaffe contributed to this report.","Potential Republican presidential candidates were quick to lampoon President Barack Obama's tax policies .

"Is the glass ceiling in Britain finally beginning to crack? A new report on the gender makeup of FTSE 100 (the top 100 firms listed on the London Stock Exchange) company boardrooms suggests that just might be the case -- but not all the experts are convinced. Women now account for 20.7% of FTSE 100 executive board members, an increase of 12.5% since 2011, according to The Cranfield School of Management's Female FTSE Board report released Wednesday. Lord Davies, a former UK trade minister who has been tasked with improving gender equality in Britain's boardrooms, described the findings as ""impressive"" but only part of the journey toward gender fairness at the top of the country's leading firms. ""We are finally seeing a culture change taking place at the heart of British business,"" Davies said. Real progress? There are now only two members of the FTSE 100 -- copper mining company Antofagasta and natural resources group Glencore Xstrata -- with no female board representation, compared to one company in five in 2011. At the other end of the spectrum, drinks firm Diageo and business process outsourcing company Capita, are setting the pace with 44.4% female representation on their boards. Britain has set itself a target of having women make up 25% of FTSE 100 board members by 2015. This objective will be met with a further 48 appointments of women to boardroom positions within FTSE 100 companies in the next year. But while these headline figures may cast Britain's progress on this issue in an impressive light, a closer inspection reveals a far more complex picture. According to the Cranfield study, there are 48 companies in the FTSE 250 (which lists the 101st to 350th largest firms on the London Stock Exchange) with no female board representation. Many of the new boardroom positions taken up by female FTSE 100 directors in recent years, meanwhile, are non-executive positions which do not form part of the executive management team and where power and influence is limited. ""Over the past year there were 52 new female appointments to FTSE 100 boards -- representing 27% of all appointments,"" said professor Susan Vinnicombe, one of the report's authors. ""Of these, only five were executive director positions and the remaining 47 were non-executive Directorships."" Europe's leaders . The British government has looked to pressure publicly limited companies into addressing the issue of female board representation in recent years without legislating on the matter. Other European nations, however, have introduced legally binding quota systems to help ensure female representation is guaranteed on the boards of leading publicly listed companies. The likes of the Netherlands, France and Spain have all regulated to varying extents in recent years, witnessing an improvement in female representation at non-executive boardroom level as a result. Overall there are eight nations within the EU -- including France (26.8%) and the Netherlands (23.6%) -- that have a greater number of women at boardroom level than the UK, according to figures on board representation gathered by the European Commission last year. Outside the EU, Norway was the first country to introduce boardroom gender quotas in 2006 and can now count as many as 40.5% of executives in public limited companies as female, according to Statistics Norway. But in all of these countries, as in Britain, women are still more likely to occupy non-executive roles as opposed to executive director roles. 'It takes time' Elena Doldor, co-author of the Cranfield study, says pressure must be brought to bear on firms to encourage them to genuinely foster female talent rather than just perform a gender box ticking exercise. ""In order to close this gap and generate a sustainable talent pool, companies must invest more effort in developing the pipeline of female talent,"" Doldor said. Others, such as Sibylle Rupprecht, executive director for Catalyst Europe, an organization that promotes women in business, suggest that all change is good change even if it doesn't have the desired impact straight away. ""Our research has actually shown that if you have three women on the board (in non-executive positions) this translates over a period of four to five years into 21% more women in executive positions. ""The executive positions are appointed by the board or at least approved by the board. If you have more women on the board then you will have a more diverse executive thought,"" she added. ""There is a correlation but it takes a bit of time."" See also: What can the Romans teach business leaders . See also: Bill Gates in his own words .

"African Voices is a weekly show that highlights Africa's most engaging personalities, exploring the lives and passions of people who rarely open themselves up to the camera. Follow the team on Twitter. LondonWhen it comes to getting ready for a show, fast-rising South African comedian Trevor Noah has it all figured out. ""My ideal setting is I walk from the streets, backstage and straight onto the stage,"" says Noah, who last year became the first African comedian to perform on Jay Leno's The Tonight Show in the United States. ""Two minutes and I am on the stage. That way in my head I have gone from my world and then into a social setting with my friends. I want my audience to be my friends -- that is when they will get the best comedy. If they see me as a performer, they won't get the best show."" At just 28 years old, Noah  is already a big name in his country's fledgling standup scene, as well as a cover star for Rolling Stone South Africa. But despite treating the audience as friends, he's not afraid of provocative subject matter, with his latest show called ""The Racist."" Watch Trevor Noah's standup . The son of a black South African woman and a white Swiss man who met when interracial relationships were illegal in South Africa, Noah jokes that he was ""born a crime."" On stage, he draws upon his particular life experiences to tackle thorny issues with his funny, and sometimes trenchant, punchlines. ""My mom would be arrested, she would be fined and still she was like 'ooh, I don't care, I want a white man, ooh,'"" he tells a laughing audience gathered in London's Soho Theater. ""And my dad was also like, well, you know how the Swiss love chocolate."" Noah's mixed-race heritage defines his routine. Race and ethnicity are leading themes in his standup, echoing his life while growing up in Soweto during the apartheid years and being labeled mixed race. ""In the streets my father couldn't walk with us -- he would walk on the other side of the road and wave at me -- like a creepy pedophile,"" he tells the Soho Theater crowd. ""And my mom could walk with me but every time the police went by she would drop me -- I felt like a bag of weed."" Last year, British comedy supremo Eddie Izzard took Noah to perform at the Edinburgh Fringe, the biggest arts festival in the world. Noah's performance was one of the festival's talking points, enabling the comedian to return later to the UK and perform ""The Racist"" to a wider audience. For his UK tour, Noah tailored his standup for an international crowd. He says that South Africa had been living on a high during the years immediately following apartheid, but now that the ""honeymoon period is over"" many of the country's problems have re-appeared. ""A lot of racial tension has resurfaced but it is not that it was gone,"" he says. ""It's just that because we were having so much fun we didn't have enough time to pay attention to it and now because there is nothing, we realize there is still a lot of racial tension in the country. ""That is why in my [South African] show 'That's Racist,' I just love to talk about that. I believe if you want to talk about it, it is so much easier instead of acting like it's not there."" Noah says he doesn't write down any of his material. Instead, he prepares his routine by ""living life""  and evolving the stories that are of interest to him. ""I like to forge the story in my head,"" he says. ""Most of my show is true, like 90% of everything I say on stage is true, I just have to find the way to make it funny, that's the difficult thing."" Noah's quick rise to success was documented in ""You Laugh But It's True,"" a film chronicling the days leading up to Noah's first one-man show in Johannesburg, in 2009. Working to raise his international profile, Noah lived in the United States for a year, where he also made his successful appearance on the hugely popular The Tonight Show. ""That was a big moment,"" remembers Noah. ""But I think bigger than just being on The Tonight Show for me I was proud to say that I'm the first African that's on The Tonight Show, the first African comedian performing, a live performer doing the thing which people hadn't seen. It was so nice to say that look, this is possible."" He returned to South Africa last June, where he uses his American experience to enhance his act. ""Comedy is really getting quite popular in South Africa,"" says Noah. ""It's moving from the bastard child of entertainment into the mainstream, which is very good. I think the reason it's doing so well is because South Africans need to laugh and South Africans want to laugh. ""We have a lot of stories to share, we have a lot to learn about each other because we were separated for so long, so now we're trying to understand who we are and who everyone around us is as well. Comedy is a great tool for that because if you laugh with people you start to understand that you share more with them than you thought did initially and you learn about them as well.""","South African comedian Trevor Noah is the first African comic to appear on The Tonight Show .

"A broad-daylight hatchet assault on a group of New York police officers -- leaving one critically injured with a head wound -- was carried out by a self-radicalized convert to Islam in what officials Friday termed a terrorist attack. Officer Kenneth Healey, who remains in critical condition, and three of his on-duty colleagues were posing for a picture on the sidewalk Thursday afternoon when a hatchet-wielding man charged at them ""unprovoked,"" according to Police Commissioner Bill Bratton. The attacker, identified as Zale H. Thompson, was hiding behind a bus shelter as if he was waiting to attack the officers, according to a law enforcement official, who said it almost appeared as if he were stalking them. ""This was a terrorist act,"" Bratton said Friday. Thompson converted to Islam two years ago and then at some point self-radicalized, John Miller, the NYPD's deputy counterterrorism chief, told reporters Friday. Miller said Thompson was self-directed in his actions, and he had no affiliations with any particular group. Thompson was unemployed, and police said his parents described their son as a depressed recluse who spent much of his time online. A common theme in his social media presence was ""anti-Western, anti-government and in some cases anti-white,"" Miller said. According to police, Thompson's recent Internet activity revealed he had searched for things such as beheadings, al Qaeda, ISIS and al Shabaab, indicating that ""he had been thinking about (carrying out an attack) for some time,"" said Miller. Healey, 28, was struck in the back of the head. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said Friday Healey was in critical but stable condition. Officer Joseph Meeker, 24, was struck in the arm. He was treated and released, according to de Blasio. The remaining two officers fired at the 32-year-old Thompson, killing him. In the chaos, one of the officer's bullets struck a nearby pedestrian in her lower back. De Blasio said Friday that she was in critical but stable condition. De Blasio praised the officers' swift response in the attack, which police said lasted seven seconds. ""Here are four rookie cops, just starting out in their career, when the absolute unexpected happened,"" de Blasio said at a Thursday press conference. ""They responded exactly as their training dictated and ended the situation -- thank God -- very, very quickly. "" In the aftermath, some observers questioned if the attack was tied to recent calls by radicals to strike the military and police, especially on the heels of separate attacks on officers in Canada earlier this week. On Wednesday, a soldier was shot and killed as he stood guard at Canada's National War Memorial in Ottawa.

"Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy signed a bill into law Wednesday that abolishes the death penalty, making his state the 17th in the nation to abandon capital punishment and the fifth in five years to usher in a repeal. The law is effective immediately, though prospective in nature, meaning that it would not apply to those already sentenced to death. It replaces the death penalty with life in prison without the possibility of release as the state's highest form of punishment. ""Although it is an historic moment -- Connecticut joins 16 other states and the rest of the industrialized world by taking this action -- it is a moment for sober reflection, not celebration,"" Malloy said in a statement. He added that the ""unworkability"" of Connecticut's death penalty law was a contributing factor in his decision. ""In the last 52 years, only two people have been put to death in Connecticut -- and both of them volunteered for it,"" Malloy said. ""Instead, the people of this state pay for appeal after appeal, and then watch time and again as defendants are marched in front of the cameras, giving them a platform of public attention they don't deserve."" This month, lawmakers in the state's House of Representatives passed the bill by a vote of 86 to 63. The state Senate had approved it a week before. State lawmakers first tried to pass a similar bill in 2009 but were ultimately blocked by then-Gov. Jodi Rell, a Republican. Capital punishment has existed in the Nutmeg State since its colonial days. But it was forced to review its death penalty laws beginning in 1972, when a Supreme Court decision required greater consistency in its application. A moratorium was then imposed until a 1976 decision by the high court upheld the constitutionality of capital punishment. Since then, Connecticut juries have handed down 15 death sentences. Of those, only one person has been executed, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonpartisan group that studies death penalty laws. Michael Ross, a convicted serial killer, was put to death by lethal injection in 2005 after he voluntarily gave up his appeals. The state now has 11 people on death row. Advocates of a repeal say that Connecticut's past law kept inmates -- who were often engaged in multiple appeals -- on death row for extended periods of time, costing taxpayers far more than if the convicts were serving a life sentence in the general prison population. They also point to instances in which wrongful convictions have been overturned with new investigative methods, including forensic testing. Opponents of the repeal had said that capital punishment is a criminal deterrent that offers justice for victims and their families. In the last five years, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York and Illinois have repealed the death penalty. California voters will decide the issue in November.","Connecticut Gov.

"Police in eastern India have arrested the husband and parents-in-law of a young woman for allegedly burning her and her baby girl alive. The primary motive behind the January 30 attack is suspected to be dowry-related, as alleged by the parents of the dead woman,  Jharkhand state police superintendent N.K. Mishra said. The three suspects poured kerosene on Annu Devi, 22, and the baby girl at their village home in the state's Dumka district and set them on fire, Mishra said. The 1-year-old child died instantly, and the mother later succumbed to her injuries in a hospital, police said. A court has sent the three suspects to jail to await trial, Mishra told CNN. Asked whether the fact that Devi gave birth to a girl was also a motive, Mishra said: ""That could be a factor. But it was mainly for dowry. Her family has said in their complaint she was harassed for money and other things."" Devi married three years ago, Mishra said. Dowry is banned in India, but giving expensive ""gifts"" to the grooms and their relatives at weddings hosted by the brides' families remains a common practice in the country. Police across India registered 8,233 murders of women as dowry deaths in 2012, according to national crime data.

"Three Secret Service agents were sent home after one of them was found passed out after a night of drinking in Amsterdam, an official familiar with the incident told CNN. The agents were in the Netherlands as part of a contingent preparing for President Barack Obama's visit there this week. According to the official, one Secret Service agent was found intoxicated and passed out in the hallway of his hotel. Hotel staff subsequently alerted U.S. authorities. This agent and two other agents -- who were his companions on a night out drinking in the Dutch capital -- were disciplined by being sent home Sunday for not exercising better judgment. Confirming that three agents went home for disciplinary reasons, Secret Service spokesman Edwin Donovan added an investigation is underway. The story was first reported by The Washington Post. White House spokesman Jay Carney said Wednesday that Obama had been briefed on the incident. ""Generally, the President believes, as he has said in the past, that everybody representing the United States of America overseas needs to hold himself or herself to the highest standards and he supports(Secret Service Director Julia Pierson's) zero-tolerance approach on these matters,"" Carney said. The agents are blamed for not doing more to prevent another embarrassment for the 150-year-old agency, whose mission includes investigating crimes such as counterfeiting and credit card fraud in addition to protecting top U.S. figures, including presidents. One of the biggest, most recent black eyes came nearly two years ago and also involved an advance team ahead of an Obama visit to Colombia for the Summit of the Americas. In that case, Secret Service agents hit the clubs of Cartagena for a night of drinking that ended with bringing prostitutes back to their hotel. The agency immediately pulled 11 agents allegedly involved in the scandal from Obama's security detail, put them on administrative leave and removed their security clearances. In addition, 12 military personnel also were cited for their role. Several government reports later examined the incident, looking into not just what happened but how the Secret Service handled the matter. The agency has instituted tougher disciplinary rules in the wake of the Cartagena scandal. 2 Secret Service supervisors under investigation in misconduct probe .

"(CNN) -- Nordic countries agreed to lend struggling Iceland $2.5 billion to help it recover from a series of crippling bank failures, bolstering a $2.1 billion aid package from the International Monetary Fund, their governments announced Thursday. Prime Minister Geir Haarde has been trying to drum up support for Iceland's bailout. ""This is a first step to get Iceland out of its current serious financial and economic situation,"" the governments of Finland, Norway, Denmark and Sweden announced in a joint statement. ""The banking crisis in Iceland is of unprecedented proportions and has serious implications for the country's economy."" The statement follows the IMF's decision on Wednesday to pump about $827 million into the Icelandic economy immediately, with another $1.3 billion coming in eight installments. Both moves are aimed at stabilizing Iceland's finances and shoring up its currency, which plummeted after a series of bank failures in October. Iceland sought IMF help after its government was forced to nationalize three banks to head off a complete collapse of its financial system. Trading on the country's stock market was suspended for nearly a week, economic growth nearly flatlined and inflation jumped to more than 12 percent. ""As a result,Iceland is facing a severe recession, given the high debt level in the economy and significant dependence of the private sector on foreign currency and inflation-indexed debt,"" John Lipsky, the IMF's acting chairman, said in a statement announcing the decision. The IMF move marks the first time the international lender has had to funnel money to a Western European country in 25 years. Lipsky said Iceland's highly-educated workers and resource base gives it ""favorable"" prospects for long-term growth, but he cautioned, ""The road ahead is difficult."" ""The program is subject to exceptionally large uncertainty and significant risks, reflecting the unprecedented magnitude of the banking sector collapse,"" he said. The package requires Iceland to restructure its banking industry, which had grown rapidly since the 1990s, and cut its government debt. ""The work with implementing the IMF program will not be easy, but given appropriate measures, we believe that there is a good basis for rebalancing the economy,"" the Nordic countries' statement read. ""We stand ready to assist Iceland in the spirit of continuous Nordic cooperation.""","Help comes from Finland, Norway, Denmark and Sweden .

"(CNN) -- Armed with just a video-enabled cell phone and a YouTube account, California resident John Tyner sparked a nationwide controversy over new TSA backscatter imaging machines and pat-down procedures during the busy holiday air travel season. Tyner is the man who told a TSA agent not to touch his ""junk"" while he refused a pat-down search November 13 at a San Diego, California, airport. As Americans fly to and from holiday gatherings this season, some travelers -- anxious about their rights at airport security checkpoints -- may try to follow Tyner's lead and video their TSA encounters. Is that legal? It depends. TSA says on its blog: ""If you are taking pictures at or near the checkpoint, don't be surprised if someone (TSA, airport police, or a curious passenger) asks you what you're up to. We don't prohibit public, passengers or press from photographing, videotaping, or filming at screening locations. You can take pictures at our checkpoints as long as you're not interfering with the screening process or slowing things down. ""We also ask that you do not film or take pictures of our monitors. However, while the TSA does not prohibit photographs at screening locations, local laws, state statutes, or local ordinances might. Your best bet is to call ahead and see what that specific airport's policy is."" Wednesday on NetworkWorld.com, ""Ms. Smith,"" the site's privacy and security blogger, wrote about what you can do if threatened with arrest when recording video at TSA checkpoints. Smith advises: ""If you are flying and decide to turn on your phone to take video of TSA checkpoints, that is legal as long as you do not film the TSA's monitors, or interfere with or slow down the screening process. However, if you do videotape TSA checkpoints, then you should have the TSA public affairs (TSA's Office of Strategic Communications) number plugged into your phone: 571-227-2829. ""Another important phone number to have with you is the TSA's Office of Civil Rights at 571-227-1917. It all depends where you are and if the police or TSA agents know the law."" Smith also recaps several recent incidents where travelers were threatened with arrest or had their phones or cameras confiscated by police or airport security for attempting to take photos or video at TSA checkpoints. If you do decide to shoot video with your phone of the TSA, police, or other security officials in action, it helps to keep in mind that the secret of good video is good audio. So keep talking. Tyner's 12-minute video of his TSA encounter certainly isn't much to look at -- most of the time the camera is pointing at the ceiling or at people's feet or waists. Tyner did not shove his phone's camera in the faces of the officers who were questioning and detaining him. He managed to confront them clearly, and convey his concern and outrage, through talking -- rather than the more confrontational body language that pointing a camera at someone's face implies. This can help control tension in a stressful encounter. What made Tyner's video so popular is that you can hear pretty clearly what the people involved in the encounter were saying and the tone of their interactions. The microphone on Tyner's phone captured sufficiently good audio to get the point across. Not all cell phones have good microphones, so make sure you record some test video -- in advance, probably before you get involved in a security confrontation -- so you know what to do. (More tips for cell phone audio recording.) So if you're shooting video of a security encounter, keep talking; keep asking questions -- especially clarifying ones like ""What are you doing?"" rather than rhetorical ones like ""Ever hear of the U.S. Constitution?""; let people answer you -- don't interrupt them or shout over them; and generally collect as much audio information as possible. Note that Tyner apparently did not inform the TSA officials that he was recording the encounter, which may also be why he didn't point the phone at them. Recording police or security officers can be a legal gray area. As Glenn Harlan Reynolds explained in ""Popular Mechanics"" earlier this year, taking photos is public places is not a crime. However, as Wendy McElroy explained in the blog, ""The Freeman,"" 12 states currently have laws requiring that ""all parties must consent for a recording to be legal -- unless, as with TV news crews, it is obvious to all that recording is underway."" Three of these states have taken this recording restriction a step further. According to McElroy, Illinois, Maryland and Massachusetts have specifically made it ""illegal to record an on-duty police officer even if the encounter involves you and may be necessary to your defense, and even if the recording is on a public street where no expectation of privacy exists."" It's unclear whether this law also applies to other security officers such as TSA, transit police, or campus security. Recording security or police officers in action definitely is not risk-free. Knowing your rights, the law in that state, location-specific policies like airport rules, your equipment, and recording technique basics can help you make the best decisions in these situations.","John Tyner sparked controversy with his 12- minute video of his recent TSA encounter .

"Investigators have pieced together the movements of a missing University of Virginia student the night she went missing, with the police chief saying they believe she got into a car with a man. Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo stopped short of calling the man a suspect in the disappearance of Hannah Graham, saying he was still considered ""a person of interest."" ""Let me just say this, we are interested in him,"" Longo told reporters during a news conference. Graham, 18, was last seen early September 13 in an area of Charlottesville known as the downtown mall. Using surveillance video and witness statements, authorities tracked Graham along the mall. At one point, she was seen with a man going into a bar, where he ordered a drink, Longo said. They were then seen leaving the bar together. Investigators also know the man drove away from the area in a burnt orange 1998 Chrysler coupe that was parked near the bar, Longo said. ""My point is this, people saw Hannah and people saw him, and people saw them together,"" he told reporters during a news conference. ""...If you remember seeing that vehicle and you remember seeing somebody get back in it, and you remember seeing somebody drive away, then we need to hear from you."" The details were released just hours after authorities searched an apartment and a car belonging to the man. ""Is he in custody? No,"" Longo said. ""...Was there probable cause to arrest him? No."" Longo declined to say what investigators seized during the searches. Investigators are offering a $50,000 reward for ""information leading to the cause"" of her disappearance, police said. Graham, a sophomore, is described as a straight-A student and an accomplished athlete from northern Virginia. She's about 5-foot-11 with blue eyes, light brown hair and freckles, the university said in a release asking for tips about the teen's disappearance. Graham left a dinner with a group of friends around 11 p.m. last Friday. Around 1:20 a.m. Saturday, she sent a text to friends saying she was lost, CNN affiliate WTVR reported. Police believe she may have been under the influence of alcohol, Longo has said, and may have been vulnerable or unable to defend herself. Her parents attended a candlelight vigil Thursday night organized by students, which the couple described as ""extremely moving."" ""We were comforted by the evident high esteem in which our cherished daughter is held by her many friends at the University of Virginia and beyond,"" John and Sue Graham said in a statement. ""We continue to be optimistic that Hannah will soon be returned safely to us."" The police chief said he has not given up hope Graham will be found. ""I will always be hopeful until we find Hannah,"" he said. Graham's parents haven't given up hope either, he said. ""They are hurt. They are concerned. They are frustrated,"" he said.

"Hashima Island is one of the strangest places you'll ever be able to explore -- and few can. This eerie, desolate place of deserted tower blocks some 17 kilometers (10.5 miles) off the coast of Nagasaki in western Japan was opened to tourists four years ago but access is strictly limited. The buildings are too decrepit, so tourists skirt a defined path around one corner of the island. Only with special permission from Nagasaki City Council can you pick your way through the apartment blocks and climb the so-called ""Stairway to Hell"" to get a proper view of the ruins from the wind-battered shrine at the top. It is a scene more of devastation than decay when viewed from above. Decades of typhoons and sea water erosion have torn at the concrete high-rises. Foundations hammered deep into the ocean to support the huge concrete structures stand exposed. Timber, which once lined balconies, lies in piles where the wind has left it. Take a wrong turn and you'll find yourself on narrow paths connecting one rooftop with another, vertiginous drops on either side. If you have any fear of heights at all, it's the kind of situation where you might prefer to inch down to ground level on your hands and knees rather than your feet. However this scene will seem strangely familiar to James Bond fans -- Hashima served as the inspiration for the villain's home in the latest 007 movie ""Skyfall."" The courtyard of building number 65 is where one unfortunate Bond girl meets a sticky end. According to Nagasaki City Council, location scouts came a number of times to scope the island but decided it was too dangerous for filming. So Hashima sets remarkably close to the real thing were built at Pinewood Studios instead. The once bustling island community's raison d'être was coal. The first mine shaft was dug here in 1887. Three years later Japanese engineering giant Mitsubishi bought Hashima and transformed it into a highly efficient mining facility housing workers and their families in some of the world's earliest concrete high-rises. The island expanded as Japan's demand for coal grew -- upwards in a forest of apartment blocks and outwards by a series of land reclamations. Though today weeds and plants have taken root in derelict balconies and rooftops, children then knew only grey. ""There were no bushes, no flowers, we didn't even know what the cherry blossom was,"" recalled Hideo Kaji, who was born on Hashima in 1932. ""We told the seasons from one another by listening to the wind or looking at the color of the ocean and the sky."" The period of Kaji's childhood was also the darkest in Hashima's history. Like many of imperial Japan's industrial facilities, Hashima was a destination for hundreds of Korean forced laborers. During World War II, Chinese prisoners of war joined their ranks. For them, Hashima was a desperate place. In the peace museum at Nagasaki, testimonies from Korean forced laborers line the walls, collated by museum director Yasunori Takazane. ""The common stories I heard from Korean and Chinese laborers was that they are enormously hungry. The meals were miserable and when they could not go to work they were tortured, punched and kicked."" Kaji's best friend at school was Korean. He says he didn't see much discrimination against Koreans but he remembers his parents talking about one episode when a Korean worker was beaten. ""My father and mother were saying how sorry they were but my Dad said it was inevitable because it is wartime."" He remembers resenting the Chinese as a child because they were ""locked up in the southern part of the island, right where we used to play baseball. We were so upset they took our place to play, but after the war ended I learned they were forced to work there."" Kaji only left the island in 1974 when the mine closed down. Petrol had replaced coal as Japan's major fuel source. Mitsubishi pulled out, the workers found jobs on the mainland and Hashima was left to rot.""It was an energy revolution and we all knew in our hearts that it was end for coal,"" said Kaji. ""If I were to describe it in one word, it was just sad. Even now I still see it as a once in a lifetime thing, living on that island.""Read more: Hashima Island's dark history . Tomoji Kobata only lived on Hashima for a year in 1961 but he knows the paths in and around the ruins inside out. Well into his seventies he picks his way through the rubble, pointing out the oddities that were part of everyday life -- the baths where the water was always black because the miners would jump in fully clothed at the end of a long day; the spots on the fortified walls where lovers would eek out a privacy of sorts to watch the sun go down. This was the period when Hashima was one of the most densely populated places on earth -- 5,259 people living on just 16 acres at its peak in 1959. ""It reminded me of Hong Kong. Cooking hours were quite noisy. Wives would borrow seasoning and exchange food they couldn't finish. No one needed to lock the door."" Kobata now works for Gunkanjima Concierge, one of the tour operators that bring tourists to the island. He says he'll tell visitors about the forced labor issue but he won't dwell on it. ""There were so many other sides to life on the island beyond that,"" he said. But it remains a sore point. Japan wants Hashima recognized as a UNESCO world heritage site but South Korea objects. Takazane says Japan needs to address the issue with more honesty. ""Auschwitz is registered as world heritage site so people can remember the historical crime. As for Hashima, some seem not to want to remember that dark side and focus instead on its contribution as a locomotive of Japan's industrialization. That's a betrayal of history."" Japan was required to pay reparations to the countries it wronged during World War II as part of a series of post-war treaties. On the 50th anniversary of the end of the war, Japan's Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama offered a general apology for the ""tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations' caused by its 'colonial rule and aggression.'""  But there have been several recent lawsuits, filed by Chinese workers against Mitsubishi, demanding compensation and a specific apology for their enslavement in facilities across the Japanese empire during the war. All have failed. Kobata may be right to say there is a lot more to Hashima's history than the forced labor that tarnished its earlier years. It may not have been any worse a place necessarily than any of the other forced labor locations around the Japanese Empire. But as it crumbles slowly into the ocean, the island's concrete towers are an eerie symbol of a war wound that has not yet healed.","Hashima, on Japan's West coast, opened its first coal mine in 1887 .

"(CNN) -- The threat of violence against feminist and gaming critic Anita Sarkeesian, which led her to cancel a speaking appearance this week at Utah State University, has refocused attention on a recent and often-misunderstood debate. It's called #Gamergate, with or without the hashtag, and it has triggered ongoing, online barrages between a wide variety of disgruntled people: video gamers, feminists, Internet trolls, scholars, misogynists, gaming-industry journalists and almost anyone else with web access and an ax to grind. ""It's been the talk of video game professionals for the past two months,"" gaming critic Evan Narcisse said. ""The culture wars that ... hit other creative media (are) hitting video games now."" Even to those involved, #Gamergate is a confusing, unwieldy topic. So let's try to simplify it for you. What is #Gamergate? At its most basic level, it's a heated debate over journalistic integrity, the definition of video games and the identity of those who play them. On one side are the so-called hardcore gamers, most of them male, who make and play adrenaline-fueled games such as the ""Halo"" and ""Call of Duty"" shooter series. On another side are a new wave of gaming enthusiasts, many of them women, who are making and playing games that don't involve a shootout, a chase or sometimes even a quest of any kind. Then there are the others (see above) who smell a fight and have piled on. The vitriol, much of it aimed against women, has spilled from the Internet into the physical world. In recent months several women in the gaming industry say they received rape and death threats so specific they were forced to leave their homes. Some gamers have adopted ""Gamergate"" as the term for a loosely defined movement defending hardcore games against criticisms from feminists and others. How did it start? The roots of the dispute go back years. But the current debate began in late August, when Sarkeesian released the latest of her videos called ""Tropes vs. Women,"" in which she critiques games that portray women as victims, ornamental eye candy and other archetypes. About the same time, game designer Zoe Quinn was attacked online by an ex-boyfriend who alleged in lengthy blog posts that she cheated on him with a journalist from gaming-news site Kotaku to further her career. Quinn denied the claim, and Kotaku's investigation found no wrongdoing. But furious gamers took to Twitter, Reddit and other places to complain about ethical lapses in gaming journalism. And both Quinn and Sarkeesian found themselves subject to violent online threats. Actor Adam Baldwin, best known for roles in ""Full Metal Jacket"" and the ""Firefly"" TV series, was credited with coining the #Gamergate hashtag later that month on Twitter. Opponents who feel the harassment of women has gone too far have countered with #StopGamergate2014, which was trending Wednesday. The arguments on both sides have expanded to include such other topics as free speech and perceived media bias against core gamers. Share your view on #Gamergate . Why are people so angry? The gaming universe has expanded beyond consoles in recent years to include players -- many of them women -- of casual and social games such as ""FarmVille"" and ""Candy Crush."" According to one survey, 48% of gamers are now female. More women also are entering gaming as developers or game reviewers. And increasingly they're speaking out about what they perceive as sexism in the industry. ""For 30 years now video games have really been perceived as a boys' club. You've had video games made by men, for men,"" game designer Brianna Wu said this week. ""And I think in 2014, when almost half of the video game players are women ... you're seeing some very insecure guys feeling threatened by that and lashing out."" Of course, many male gamers are horrified by the recent harassment of women. Others, though, say that feminist attacks on games are akin to censorship and they are tired of being lectured to by politically correct ""social justice warriors."" ""There are now two, bitterly opposed, factions in the industry. Journalists and activists, who care more about gender politics than the video games they are supposed to be reporting on, and gamers, mocked, derided and bullied... but unbowed,"" wrote Milo Yiannopoulos in a September 1 Breitbart.com column titled ""Feminist Bullies Tearing the Video Game Industry Apart."" Can we resolve this? Maybe, but it will take time. The Internet is an unruly place. Just last weekend, Wu said she fled her Boston home after receiving threats on Twitter. As with any vast and diverse group, it will be difficult to get video gamers to agree on any strictures on their art form or community. But the ongoing threats against female gamers appear to be rallying support to the #StopGamergate side. On Wednesday the leading trade group for the video game industry weighed in. ""Threats of violence and harassment are wrong,"" said a spokesman for the Entertainment Software Association in a statement sent to The Washington Post. ""They have to stop. There is no place in the video game community -- or our society -- for personal attacks and threats."" Ultimately, everyone will benefit by trying to defuse tensions between the two sides. And if gaming executives perceive the treatment of female gamers reflects poorly on the industry and is affecting their bottom line, they may have no choice.","Threats against a feminist critic have refocused attention on #Gamergate .

"Some Pennsylvania residents who live near a Chevron natural gas well that exploded, killing a worker, are getting compensation of sorts from the corporation. Free pizza and sodas. Chevron is dispensing 100 gift certificates for pizza and soft drinks to those in the area of Greene County where the February 11 explosion sparked a fire that burned for four days. An employee at Bobtown Pizza confirmed the corporation's order of gift certificates. The cause of the explosion is still unknown, according to Jeff Rhodes, Greene County 911 Emergency Coordinator. The blast killed a worker and injured another, and although the fire is out gas and heat are still being emitted into the atmosphere, Rhodes said. Chevron's edible outreach is not sitting well with some recipients. ""Worst apology ever: Sorry our fracking well exploded. Here's a free pizza,"" one angry Twitter user wrote Tuesday. ""Nice community relations: if you are frightened by fire and explosion, relax, have a pizza!"" another tweet stated. One resident who said he wished to remain anonymous because of Chevron's strong presence in the area told CNN that he received a certificate on Sunday while he and his family were out. He said it was the first and last time they had heard from Chevron regarding the incident. ""It felt like a huge slap in the face,"" the resident told CNN. ""I do not feel that they've addressed anything. I haven't even called their hotline yet because I'm just too upset. A pizza coupon? I mean come on!"" In a statement to CNN, Chevron stated that the corporation ""offered a token of appreciation"" to neighbors who were affected by the events. A letter also accompanied the gift certificates, according to CNN affiliate KDKA, with the letter stating, ""Chevron recognizes the effect this has had on the community. We value being a responsible member of this community and will continue to strive to achieve incident-free operations. We are committed to taking action to safeguard our neighbors, our employees, our contractors and the environment."" ""We appreciate the strong support we have received from nearby residents as we work to respond to this incident in a safe manner,"" the Chevron statement said. The resident who spoke to CNN said he plans to move his family as a result of the incident. ""We're moving as soon as we can. That's not their only well near our house. It's just not safe,""  he said. In an update published Tuesday on its website, Chevron said the situation at the well ""remains serious and teams are working around the clock to safely approach and shut the well.""","A Chevron natural gas well exploded last week, killing one worker and injuring another .

"Al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen -- al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula  -- strongly rebuked ISIS in a video released Friday, declaring ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's declaration of an Islamic caliphate to be illegitimate. The statement, delivered by one of AQAP's top clerics --  Harith bin Ghazi al-Nadhari -- is a significant setback to ISIS efforts to assume leadership of the global jihadist movement a week after groups in Egypt and Libya joined the ISIS fold. ISIS and al Qaeda's top leadership in Pakistan had a bitter falling out earlier this year, and al Qaeda and ISIS fighters have been fighting each other in Syria, but AQAP had until now stayed above the fray, calling for both sides to reconcile and pool resources to strike the United States. But when al-Baghdadi declared  in an audiotape released last week his Islamic State had expanded to Yemen, as well as other Middle Eastern countries, it was too much for the AQAP leadership to stomach. By claiming Yemen for his caliphate, al-Baghdadi had called into question the very right of AQAP to exist as a separate and autonomous jihadi group, leaving its leadership no choice but to push back. ""We did not want to talk about the current dispute and the sedition in Syria... however, our brothers in the Islamic State ... surprised us with several steps, including their announcement of the caliphate [and] they announced the expansion of the caliphate in a number of countries which they have have no governance, and considered them to be provinces that belonged to them,"" al-Nadhari stated, according to a translation by the SITE intelligence group. ""The announcement of the caliphate for all Muslims by our brothers in the Islamic State did not meet the required conditions,"" al-Nashari argued, because other jihadi groups were not consulted. The cleric also criticized ISIS for ""going too far in interpretations in terms of spilling inviolable blood under the excuse of expanding and spreading the power of the Islamic State."" And in a repudiation of al-Baghdadi's claim to supremacy among jihadis, he reaffirmed the group's pledge of allegiance to al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri and Taliban leader Mullah Omar. In forcing AQAP to publicly choose sides, al-Baghdadi appears to have badly miscalculated. AQAP leader Nasir al Wuhayshi, despite being named the number two of al Qaeda globally by al-Zawahiri last year, had been careful not to weigh in publicly on the dispute between al Qaeda and ISIS, restricting himself only to a poem he released in July praising his Egyptian boss. In February, the general command of al Qaeda declared it had severed ties with ISIS because of its insubordination and its brutal tactics against fellow Muslims. By then, Jabhat al Nusra, al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, and ISIS were already fighting each other in parts of northern Syria. Although U.S airstrikes against both groups in recent weeks have led to ceasefires and some cooperation at the local level against moderate rebel groups, relations have remained tense. AQAP divisions over ISIS . The AQAP leadership's rebuke of ISIS is not likely to go down well with all its members. Wuhayshi had avoided previously criticizing al-Baghdadi because he feared it might exacerbate divisions inside his own group. ISIS's rapid territorial expansion in Iraq and Syria electrified many jihadis in Yemen, and led to disagreements within the group. ""We have discussed that which resulted from the dispute and the infighting in Sham (Syria) with debate and argument ... however, we pardoned those who raised such issues,"" al-Nadhari acknowledged in the video released Friday. Everything to know about the rise of ISIS . In January, one mid-level AQAP figure --  Mamoun Hatem . -- tweeted his support for ISIS as its feud with al Qaeda heated up, prompting speculation of discord within its ranks. This past summer, Abdul Majid al Raymi, a leading Yemeni Salafi-jihadi preacher long admired by AQAP, also came out in support for ISIS, asking his large number of followers in Yemen to do the same. The U.S. air campaign against ISIS further boosted the popularity of ISIS in Yemeni jihadi circles, prompting AQAP to release a message of solidarity. ""Their blood is our blood, and their wounds are in our hearts, and supporting them is a duty upon us. Once we find a way to afflict America, we will follow it, Allah permitting,"" the group stated in a statement posted on Twitter on August 14, and translated by SITE. Even in disagreement, respect . All this has made AQAP leaders tread carefully. Even in rebuking ISIS, AQAP's al-Nadhari was careful to refer to al-Baghdadi respectfully as ""sheikh."" The cleric expressed hope that divisions between ISIS and Nusra could be healed and left the door open for fences to be mended between AQAP and ISIS if al-Baghdadi withdrew his fatwa claiming Yemen for his caliphate. ""We express our utmost joy to having received good news about what we heard of signs of stopping the infighting among the mujahideen in the Sham front [Syria],"" al-Nadhari stated. Despite the possibility of growing discord within AQAP, there are no signs of any immediate threat to Wuhayshi's leadership. To date, no senior leader within AQAP has broken ranks and come out in favor of ISIS. Wuhayshi, by all accounts, remains exceptionally popular with the group's rank-and file-fighters, who have been energized by a call to arms to fight Shia Houthi fighters who recently took control of Sana'a. But AQAP's rebuke of ISIS increases the chances of a splinter group emerging. Last week, a group calling itself Mujahideen in Yemen recorded a tape pledging loyalty to Baghdadi. Egyptian terror group pledges alliance to ISIS . For ISIS, the rebuke by AQAP is a significant setback after recent wins elsewhere in the region in its jockeying with al Qaeda for pre-eminence in the global jihadi movement. Last week, Ansar Beit al Maqdis, an increasingly powerful Egyptian group based in the Sinai, declared allegiance to al-Baghdadi, as did veteran Libyan ISIS fighters who have taken control of Derna, a major town in eastern Libya. Small splinter factions of the Pakistani Taliban and al Qaeda in North Africa, as well as a group of fighters in Saudi Arabia, also declared their support. The AQAP move may see the Yemeni group step up cooperation with Jabhat al Nusra in Syria. U.S. officials believe AQAP has shared sophisticated bomb-making technology with the Khorasan Group, a Nusra-linked outfit of veteran al Qaeda operatives plotting terrorist attacks against Western aviation. The prospects of ISIS also receiving such bomb-making know-how from the Yemeni group appear to have dimmed. Why ISIS is spreading across Muslim world .","Al Qaeda group in Yemen rebukes ISIS .

"A San Diego college student filed a legal claim Wednesday for damages suffered when he was left handcuffed and without food or water in a Drug Enforcement Administration holding cell for five days last month. A DEA statement said Daniel Chong, 23, was ""accidentally left"" in a holding cell. ""Accidentally? He almost died,"" said Chong's lawyer, Gene Iredale. ""It's inexplicable."" Chong drank his own urine to survive as his cries for help were ignored by federal agents and inmates in nearby cells, Iredale said. The fifth-year engineering student at the University of California, San Diego, was detained on the morning of April 21, a Saturday, when DEA agents raided a house they suspected was being used to distribute MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy. A multi-agency narcotics task force including state agents detained nine people and seized about 18,000 MDMA pills, marijuana, prescription medications, hallucinogenic mushrooms, several guns and thousands of rounds of ammunition from the house, the DEA said. Chong admitted going to the house ""to get high with his friends,"" the DEA said. He later told a San Diego TV station that he knew nothing about the other drugs and guns. He was never formally arrested or charged, the DEA said. The agents sent seven suspects to county jail and released another person, but Chong ""was accidentally left in one of the cells,"" the DEA said. The agency did not explain how he was forgotten for five days in the small, windowless cell. It wasn't until the afternoon of Wednesday, April 25, that an agent opened the steel door to Chong's cell and found the handcuffed student, Iredale said. ""Even if they forgot him for the weekend, there is no account for how they could have left him there for three full business days,"" Iredale said. The acting special agent in charge of the DEA's San Diego office said he was ""deeply troubled"" by the incident and he offered his ""deepest apologies"" to Chong. ""This event is not indicative of the high standards that I hold my employees to,"" William Sherman said. ""I have personally ordered an extensive review of our policies and procedures."" On Wednesday, Iredale filed a damage claim with the DEA, which he said is the beginning of the process for a civil suit in federal court. ""He began hallucinating sometime around the end of the second or start of the third day,"" Iredale said. ""At some point, he wanted to kill himself because of pain."" Not knowing why he was being kept in the cell without food, water or a toilet for so long confused him, Iredale said. He lost track of time in the dark cell, his lawyer said.  ""At the end, he just wanted to die because he was crazy."" Chong contorted himself to shift his handcuffed arms from behind his back to the front, Iredale said.  This allowed him to use his eyeglasses to scratch a message to his family on his arm: ""Sorry mom."" He was rushed to a hospital, where he was kept in intensive care for two days, having been close to death from kidney failure, Iredale said. The Cerritos, California, native is now recovering at home, he said.","DEA says agents ""accidentally left"" Daniel Chong in a holding cell .

"Enrique Perez's daughter was born a boy. But, from an early age, Perez says, his first-born made clear a preference for pink clothes, dolls and ""anything princess."" The family lived in Mexico at the time and decided to support her choices. She grew her hair long and wore pink clothes to school. She was 5 years old in December 2012 when she declared that she wanted to ditch the boy toys, pierce her ears and ""live fully"" as a girl -- pronouns and all, Perez said. Her parents again decided to respect her wishes. Since moving from Mexico City to New York in 2013, they've only told school officials and close friends about her transition. They want people to get to know her without preconceived notions. Perez asked to withhold her name from this article to avoid making her a poster child on the Internet for transgender youth. There have been ups and downs, but seeing his daughter happy on a daily basis leaves no doubt in Perez's mind that ""this is the way she is."" When the opportunity arose for the family to walk in New York City's annual Pride March this Sunday, she was eager to participate to show that she's not ashamed of who she is and that she supports others like her. ""We are happy to be a part of something like the parade, and that's because we are happy to be supportive of her,"" Perez said in a phone interview from his New York home. ""She has taught us -- and I totally agree -- that it's nothing to be ashamed of."" 'Pride is for kids, too' The Perez walked with other families of gender nonconforming children in a group of 150 people led by the Ackerman Institute's Gender and Family Project. The organization, which offers support services for families of transgender and nonconforming children, including the Perez family, walked under the banner ""Pride Is For Kids, Too."" Jean Malpas, director of the Gender and Family Project, says it was the first contingent in NYC Pride March to feature transgender and nonconforming youth and their families. ""GFP and the participating families very much hope that such a positive demonstration of pride and support for gender nonconforming children and transgender adolescents will inspire other families to provide the supportive and caring environment these children need to live happy lives,"" Malpas said. The group's presence at NYC Pride March was the latest effort from the transgender community to increase its visibility within the LGBT rubric and beyond. It also comes at a time when legislators and school districts nationwide are weighing policies to protect and support transgender and gender nonconforming youth. ""We're definitely in the middle of a gender revolution and it's exciting,"" said Johanna Olson, medical director of the Transyouth Health and Development Program at Children's Hospital Los Angeles. ""We've come long way in a relatively short time, but the flip side is people are still being killed for being transgender,"" she said. ""We still have a long way to go."" Transgender and gender nonconforming children and their families have been part of Pride events across the country, she said. Putting transgender children in the public eye through events like Pride underscores the message that gender nonconformity starts at an early age and is not something to be ashamed of, said Olson, who works with families of gender nonconforming children. Research shows that allowing children to express their true gender identity from an early age leads to better mental health outcomes down the road, she said. After all, ""transgender adults started as transgender kids,"" she said. 'We are a normal family' Coming out publicly as a family with young gender nonconforming children is not easy, and it's not for everyone, said author Lori Duron, who shares her family's experiences with a gender nonconforming son on her blog, Raising my Rainbow. She started the blog in January 2011 to build a community at a time when even fewer existed than do now for families like hers. She wanted others to know they were not alone, but she did not want to overexpose her son or make him the sole focus of the conversation. Ultimately, she and her husband decided it was worth the risk. To alleviate privacy concerns, she uses pseudonyms on her site and does not show her children's faces. ""We decided it was important for us to be advocates and for people to see that we are a normal family,"" she said. She has learned to look beyond the hate mail and focus on the growing community she has helped build. Besides, the benefits of having a happy son who feels comfortable in his skin far outweigh negativity from strangers and Internet trolls. ""There's something empowering about owning it and saying this is who I am, this is who my kid is, and I'm not going to hide him. I'm going to celebrate him."" Pride becomes family friendly . NYC Pride March is open to anyone, regardless of age, said David Studinski, NYC Pride March director. Youth participants have been a part of the march since the inaugural 1970 event, and organizers have long welcomed transgender youth and adults. ""Gender nonconforming and transgender individuals face challenges within our own community, say nothing of the vast array of perceptions they experience outside of it. Compound that with the trials and tribulations of childhood and adolescence, and it's quite obvious why these amazing young people deserve to see 2 million people supporting them along Fifth Avenue,""  Studinski said. ""What the world will see in return are smiling young faces, lit up by the ecstatic energy of rainbow-flag-waving spectators. If they're OK with who they are, the world should be, too."" Families, including infants and young children, have been a growing presence at Pride events across the country as they become more family-friendly. This year marked NYC Pride's second ""Family Movie Night"" as part of the weeklong lineup, and Boy Scouts in uniform led the color guard at Pride March under the Scouts for Equality banner. With legislative support for same-sex marriage spreading, NYC Pride March organizers decided to invite transgender actor Laverne Cox to be grand marshal to draw attention to parts of the LGBT community ""where progress in greater society is still needed,"" Studinski said. ""Understanding what it means to be a transgender individual is one of those areas."" 'Acceptance is protection' Parents who make use of of the Gender and Family Project's services started talking about participating in NYC Pride March earlier this year. Involving children was a natural extension of the program's goals to de-stigmatize gender nonconformity, program director Malpas said. Feedback from families over time has shown that ""acceptance is protection,"" and that people feel safe when they feel society accepts them. ""The highest degree of acceptance is celebration, not that I just tolerate or accept you, but that I celebrate and embrace you,"" Malpas said. ""There is value in saying it publicly. It's saying to your child I will go out and I will publicly show the world that I really celebrate you and I really love who you are and I'm not ashamed,"" he said. Some families preferred to watch the parade from the sidelines rather than march in it, Malpas said. Others, like Enrique Perez and his wife, discussed it with their daughter, but it was clear from the start which way she would lean. After all, this is a girl who told a boy in her first week at a new school in a new country that she was ""born a boy but always felt like a girl,"" her father recalled. ""We were surprised that she was the one spreading the word,"" he said. ""But, as I see it, that's who she is and I'm glad to think she fully accepts what she's going through."" People tend to underestimate children's ability to understand and talk about their gender identity, Olson said. Young children can tell if they're different, but fewer challenge the pressure to conform to society's gender standards. Parental support helps them find the words -- and courage -- to express how they feel. ""If your child says something to you then you know that they're capable of having discussions about public displays of their pride,"" she said. It's true, people will judge you for your decisions, Olson said. But at some point, parents need to take a stand for their children. ""You can suppress and oppress your child's authentic gender so you don't have to worry about what strangers think, but then you will have a very anxious child who will be at a high risk for very negative outcomes,"" she said. ""We should help children learn resiliency and to be confident and proud of who they are,"" she said. Hatred, hostility, even violence are all real risks whenever you take to the streets for an unpopular cause, she said. But, she said, history has shown that the willingness of some to take those risks ""moves the world forward.""","Transgender, gender nonconforming youths walked in NYC Pride March .

"(CNN)""American Sniper,"" Clint Eastwood's film about Navy SEAL marksman Chris Kyle, stunned just about everyone by earning $107 million over its first weekend in wide release -- an unprecedented haul for a downbeat, R-rated drama released in the middle of winter. The movie is drawing huge crowds across the moviegoing and political spectrum, from left-leaning cities to conservative small towns. Its audiences include large percentages of women and older viewers, two groups that don't typically flock to the multiplex. ""American Sniper"" has the look of a bona fide cultural phenomenon. All of which has Hollywood executives, and a lot of other people, scrambling to understand why. The movie has no doubt benefited from good timing: It hit 3,500 theaters the day after nabbing six Oscar nominations, including best picture. But Oscar love doesn't always translate to popular success -- ""The Hurt Locker,"" the 2009 best picture winner about a U.S. Army bomb-disposal team in Iraq, earned only $17 million in North America over its entire run. And until now, audiences have mostly stayed away from films about the unpopular wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. So why has ""American Sniper"" -- distributed by Warner Bros., which is owned by Time Warner, the parent company of CNN -- struck a chord when so many other modern-day war movies have not? Here are five reasons: . We're finally ready for a movie about the Iraq War . It's been three years since the U.S. involvement in Iraq formally ended, and we have some distance on it. With the vast majority of U.S. troops out of harm's way, audiences may finally be receptive to a movie that no longer hits too close to home. We saw a similar pattern after the Vietnam War in the 1970s. Although Hollywood movies about that war were made while it was still being fought, the most acclaimed Vietnam war dramas -- ""The Deer Hunter,"" ""Coming Home,"" ""Apocalypse Now"" -- began hitting U.S. theaters three to four years after the 1975 fall of Saigon. Wrote Iraq veteran and film producer Paul Rieckhoff, in a recent column for Variety: ""Most of America is tired of hearing about Iraq. But now, they're at least open to being entertained by it."" It's about someone many view as a hero . While characters in other recent combat movies such as ""Zero Dark Thirty"" have been loosely based on actual people, ""American Sniper"" is based on a firsthand account by a Navy SEAL who served four tours in Iraq. Chris Kyle was already a legend in military circles thanks to his 160 confirmed kills (he said he had many more unconfirmed, or unwitnessed ones). His 2012 memoir, ""American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History,"" spent months on the best-seller lists. As portrayed by Bradley Cooper in the movie, Kyle was about as stereotypically American as they come: A God-fearing good ol' boy from Texas who loved hunting, rodeos, his family and his country. After Kyle died in 2013, thousands filled Cowboys Stadium outside Dallas for a memorial service. His funeral procession stretched for 200 miles. ""Most of the conversation about what happened with our country in Iraq is negative. This (movie) is a positive portrayal,"" said CNN senior media correspondent Brian Stelter. ""This is a film with an American hero."" However, some critics on the left have questioned whether Hollywood is lionizing a bloodthirsty soldier who called Iraqis ""savages"" and wrote in his book that his ""only regret is that I didn't kill more."" Palin's attack on 'Hollywood Leftists' It's got a great trailer . For weeks, audiences have been seeing a riveting trailer for the movie that shows Cooper as Kyle, his rifle and scope trained on two Iraqi civilians in Fallujah who may or may not be trying to bomb a U.S. military convoy. ""I've got a woman and a kid, 200 yards out, moving towards the convoy. She's got a grenade ... she handed it to the kid,"" he says into his radio, his finger closing on the trigger. ""Your call,"" comes the reply from the radio. The tense scene is intercut with flashbacks from Kyle's life back home in Texas, including his wedding and the birth of a child. Then we're back to the Iraqi street and Kyle's split-second dilemma. ""They fry you if you're wrong,"" his fellow soldier tells him as Kyle stares down the crosshairs. We can hear his breathing. We hear music swelling ominously. We see the kid start running towards the American troops. We don't know what happens next, but we want to find out. It's a human story, not a political one . ""American Sniper"" has no grandstanding politicians or speeches about the folly of war. It's just Kyle's story, from before basic training to after he returns home for good. ""It doesn't deal with whether we should have been there, or what we were doing there,"" said CNN's Stelter. ""It only deals with the reality of what it was like for one soldier once he was there. So it's a soldier's-eye point of view."" People with opposing opinions on the war might all find evidence in the movie to support their views. Military hawks could see the Iraqis, who are portrayed in the film almost entirely as insurgents bent on killing Americans, as evildoers who must be snuffed out. Opponents of the conflict might see its effects on Cooper's character, who becomes jittery and withdrawn, as further proof of the corrosive effects of the war on returning soldiers. Still, almost everything can be politicized if you try, and ""American Sniper"" is no exception. Many conservatives, upset with what they saw as the morally ambiguous, anti-military tenor of such recent Iraq War films as the Matt Damon thriller ""Green Zone,"" have hailed ""American Sniper"" as a tribute to an American patriot. A review on right-wing website Breitbart.com called it a ""patriotic, pro-war on terror masterpiece."" Meanwhile, documentary filmmaker Michael Moore expressed a more controversial view in a tweet that called snipers ""cowards."" Opinion: Why I refuse to see 'American Sniper' It stars Bradley Cooper . One of the most popular and charismatic young actors in Hollywood, Cooper has now been nominated for an acting Oscar  three years in a row (after ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and ""American Hustle""). To play Kyle, he gained more than 30 pounds of muscle and mastered the SEAL's Texas drawl. ""Bradley did an amazing job and I truly don't believe there's anybody who could have done better,"" Taya Kyle, Chris Kyle's widow, told CNN's Jake Tapper. When her late husband's friends saw the movie, they told her ""it's eerie how much it felt like Chris ... it's like the spirit of Chris is exuding from Bradley as he's playing this role."" So put it all together -- a likable star, a respected director, a compelling true story, strong marketing and some excellent timing -- and you get a surprise blockbuster that's not likely to be duplicated anytime soon. But of course, Hollywood will try. Michael Moore explains snipers are 'cowards' tweet .","""American Sniper"" earned $105 million over its first weekend in wide release .

"Across the U.S., many families know firsthand how high maternity care costs are. As noted in The Times recently, giving birth in the U.S. is more expensive than any other country in the world. Total costs average $18,329 for a vaginal delivery and $27,866 for a C-section, with the bulk of the bill going to insurers. However, families with insurance still have to pay about $3400 out of pocket. What's ironic is we can't even claim that the extra expense pays off in healthier mothers and babies. According to a study by the Institute of Medicine, the U.S. ranks at or near the bottom on virtually all maternity care outcomes. So who's to blame for these high costs? Partly, mothers themselves. Americans are obsessed with the notions that ""newer is better"" and ""more technology is always a plus."" When it comes to medical technology, the U.S. public becomes Oliver Twist, continually asking, ""Please, sir, I want some more."" I was part of a team that recently conducted a pair of national surveys of mothers. Among the many questions, we asked if mothers agreed with the statement, ""Newer maternity tests and treatments are generally improvements over older ones."" An overwhelming majority of mothers (74%) agreed while only 10% disagreed. Likewise, when given the statement, ""Maternity tests and treatments that work the best usually cost more than those that don't work as well,"" mothers were twice as likely to agree than disagree. Mothers were also far more likely to agree that women get too few tests during pregnancy rather than too many. ""Newer equals improvement"" and ""More is better than less"" have long been effective marketing themes in American culture. But the problem is that in the case of medical technology, the results don't consistently bear that out. While other countries have set up elaborate systems to assess new medical interventions for their cost effectiveness compared to existing practices before approving them, until recently that has not been a priority in U.S. medical care. The result is that public infatuation with newer technologies merges smoothly with the medical industry's desire to profit from providing more services. A prime example of this problem is the failure to take advantage of midwife-led birthing centers. These have been found in the U.S. and overseas to be a safe and cost effective alternative to universal reliance on large hospitals. Freestanding birthing centers (as opposed to hospitals which refer to their maternity ward as a ""birthing center"") are usually directed by midwives and are affiliated with hospitals that serve as a referral site for transfers. The cost savings stem from less reliance on expensive medications and technologies, a shorter stay (mothers typically return home within 24 hours) and lower personnel costs. While the numbers of birthing centers have increased in the last decade, less than 1 in 300 U.S. births occur in a center. How come? Consider who loses money if birthing centers become popular: Large hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, obstetricians and anesthesiologists -- all powerful groups who believe deeply that the use of their products and services is not only a source of income, but the safest option for mothers and babies. The result is that an array of regulatory (restrictive state licensing laws) and financial barriers (denial of insurance coverage) combined with informal constraints (hospital refusal to provide backup) limit their use. Freestanding birthing centers aren't for everyone. They are meant to serve women with lower risk pregnancies and there's about a 1 in 8 chance a woman would need to be transferred to a hospital during labor. Nonetheless, it is of concern that so many women who are interested in it are denied an option that can provide a safe and far less expensive experience for mothers and babies. Medical technology has done wonders for our lives, especially in select, high-risk cases. But rising maternity care costs reflects the downside of our societal obsession with newer, bigger and shinier technology. The U.S. needs to seriously rethink how we approach maternity care. The first question that needs to be addressed is: Do more tests and reliance on the biggest, most expensive hospital settings actually improve the health of mothers and babies? When they do, great. But when they don't, we need to overcome the financial, institutional and cultural barriers to use reasonable options like birthing centers.","Eugene Declercq: U.S. maternity care costs are the highest in the world .
Declercq: Partly, the problem is that Americans are obsessed with newer technologies .
He says more tests, reliance on big hospitals do not improve health of mothers and babies .

"(CNN)The attack Wednesday on the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris touched off three days of terror in France as authorities staged an intensive hunt for the suspects. On Friday, security forces killed two suspects in the magazine attack who were holed up in a building north of Paris. At the same time, security forces stormed a kosher grocery store in Paris where a man suspected of killing a police officer had taken hostages. The suspect was killed and four hostages were found dead while others fled safely. Wednesday morning . About 11:30 a.m. Wednesday, according to the French newspaper Le Monde, gunmen dressed in black and wearing bulletproof vests forced their way into a building two doors down from Charlie Hebdo, asking where to find the magazine. They then headed to the correct building, where they killed an officer on security detail, officials said. They later encountered a Charlie Hebdo cartoonist who was on her way out of the building and demanded she lead them to the offices. Once there, she was told to enter a security code to open its fortified door, according to the newspaper. The gunmen barged in during a lunchtime editorial meeting, separating men and women and calling out the names of employees they intended to kill, said Dr. Gerald Kierzek, a physician who treated wounded patients and spoke with survivors. He described the gunfire as a precision execution. The gunmen said they were avenging the Prophet Mohammed and shouted ""Allahu akbar,"" which translates to ""God is great,"" Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said. Some workers managed to flee to the rooftop and record video as the attackers left and fired on police. A short time later, the gunmen opened fire as a police car blocked their way. More than a dozen bullets were shot into the patrol car. The attackers escaped. The gunmen drove a few more blocks before encountering an officer along a Parisian boulevard. They executed him on the sidewalk. In all, 12 people died the attack. Wednesday night . Thousands of Parisians took to the streets Wednesday night and held a defiant vigil for the victims. Social media responded to the terrorist attack with ""Je suis Charlie,"" or ""I am Charlie."" The show of solidarity with Paris and the satirical newspaper went viral in a multitude of languages. Late Wednesday, one suspect in the attack, 18-year-old Hamyd Mourad, turned himself in to police, a source close to the case told the AFP news agency. He did so after seeing his name mentioned on social media, the source said. Heavily armed police fanned out across the country overnight searching for the two other suspects in the attack, who would be later identified as Cherif Kouachi and Said Kouachi, brothers known to French and international intelligence. Thursday morning . As that search was ongoing, people dressed similarly to those in the Charlie Hebdo attack -- all in black and wearing bulletproof vests -- shot a female police officer in the Paris suburb of Montrouge. She later died. Meanwhile, in northern France, a gas station attendant near Villers-Cotterets reported the Kouachi brothers stole food and gas from the business, leading to a massive manhunt there. Armed officers, some in helmets and carrying shields, searched fields and forests as helicopters with night-vision optics buzzed overhead. Thursday afternoon . French Prime Minister Manuel Valls raised the terror alert level in the Picardy region to the highest level as it became the focal point in the search. Friday morning . Police and French special forces troops surrounded a building in Dammartin-en-Goele, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from Villers-Cotterets, believing the Kouachi brothers were inside. A member of France's parliament told French channel ITele the two suspects told police they wanted to die as martyrs. Many area schools were placed on lockdown, shops were told to close and residents were told to stay inside, the mayor's media office said. Friday afternoon . A new front in the crisis opened Friday afternoon when a gunman entered a kosher store in the Paris suburb of Porte de Vincennes, taking people hostage, according to a police union spokesman. The gunman is believed to be the same man accused of shooting the police officer Thursday in Montrouge, Alliance Police Union spokesman Pascal Disant said. In Dammartin-en-Goele, the move by security forces on the building where the Kouachi brothers were hiding ended with both men dead, according to district Mayor Bernard Corneille. In the supermarket standoff, suspected hostage-taker Amedy Coulibaly was killed in the operation and some police officers were injured,  Disant said. Four hostages were killed and 15 survived, according to Israeli government sources who characterized a phone conversation between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and French President François Hollande. Coulibaly's suspected accomplice -- 26-year-old Hayat Boumeddiene -- escaped as hostages ran from the store, Disant said. Friday night . Authorities search the country for Boumeddiene. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility for orchestrating the attack on Charlie Hebdo, the founder of the magazine The Intercept, Jeremy Scahill, told CNN. CNN has not independently confirmed this claim. CNN's Alanne Orjoux contributed to this report.","Attackers force their way into the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris on Wednesday; 12 die in all .

"Moscow (CNN)The father of a 27-year-old man shot dead by an FBI agent said Thursday that accounts he has heard about the killing make no sense. Ibragim Todashev was fatally shot early May 22 during questioning about a 2011 triple homicide in Waltham, Massachusetts, as well as his relationship with deceased Boston Marathon bombings suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Todashev admitted to his direct role in slashing three people's throats in Waltham and said Tsarnaev was involved as well, a federal law enforcement official told CNN. It was during that interview -- which took place in the kitchen of his Orlando, Florida, home -- that Todashev was shot dead. ""My son was definitely unarmed, because he never had a gun,"" his father Abdulbaki Todashev told CNN in Moscow. ""He couldn't attack them or fight them; he couldn't do anything because even two men could easily handle him."" Contrary to what a U.S. official said, Todashev's father claimed there were ""four of five"" law enforcement agents with his son at the time, ""all armed."" ""He didn't pose any threat to them. But even if he threatened them with his fists, couldn't they shoot his leg?"" Abdulbaki Todashev said. ""My son couldn't attack them. He's not crazy."" Addressing reporters on Thursday, Abdulbaki Todashev added his son had recently undergone leg surgery and needed crutches to walk. Group seeks investigation into Todashev's death . Photographs of his son's body show that he was shot seven times, once to the head, said Abdulbaki Todashev. ""They were torturing the man for eight hours. There was no lawyer, no witnesses, nobody. Until we get the results of the official investigation, we can only guess what was going on there."" The elder Todashev suggested his son may have been provoked. ""If you question someone for eight hours, you can provoke him into anything,"" he said. The father said he had spent much of his life raising his 12 children, and that he knew Ibragim well. ""I know what he is capable and not capable of. My son could not have done this."" Official: Tamerlan Tsarnaev involved in 2011 slayings . A U.S. government official briefed on the investigation said Thursday that Todashev had agreed to talk to authorities,and noted that he was never arrested or handcuffed. A samurai sword was in the room when Todashev sat down with two Massachusetts State Police detectives and a Boston-based FBI agent, but it was moved out of his reach. After one of the detectives left the room, the other noticed Todashev was acting odd and he texted that sense to the FBI agent with him -- the U.S. official told CNN. Those two law enforcement officials were the only ones with Todashev, according to this account. Suddenly, Todashev knocked over a table -- knocking the FBI agent back into a wall -- and came at him with some sort of ""long-handled object"" that he'd grabbed from behind him, according to the official. The agent fired a few rounds, but Todashev kept on coming, the official said. He finally stopped after yet more gunshots. ""It all happened in less than a minute,"" said the U.S. official. A law enforcement official told CNN on Friday that Todashev attacked the FBI agent with a broom handle, not a sword. ""He (Todashev) took a whack at his (the agent's) head, and he got a pretty good gash."" The official said that investigators knew going into the questioning that Todashev was proficient in mixed martial arts. The official stressed that the shooting was justified and done in self-defense because the agent felt threatened. The description of what allegedly happened -- as well as the comments from the elder Todashev -- come a day after CNN affiliate WESH and the Washington Post, citing unidentified sources, reported Todashev was unarmed when he was shot. That led the Florida chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations to call Wednesday for an investigation into the death of the Muslim man. ""Our call for an independent investigation of this disturbing incident is not just about the victim and his family, but is also about constitutional rights and the rule of law,"" said CAIR-Tampa Executive Director Hassan Shibly. But the U.S. government official briefed on the investigation rebuffed the idea that Todashev wasn't a threat -- noting, for instance, that he could have taken the agent's gun. ""He was armed. Maybe it wasn't a weapon, but he had a long object,"" the official said. And because of Todashev's martial arts expertise, ""he was a weapon himself."" An FBI spokesman earlier said the agent sustained ""non-life-threatening injuries"" in the incident. The U.S. official elaborated that the agent received treatment for lacerations. Abdulbaki Todashev said he planned to fly ""hopefully"" Friday to the United States to bring ""my son's body back to his homeland and bury him here."" ""(He was) a regular, funny boy (who) loved his brothers and sisters,"" the father said. ""He wanted to stay (in the United States and I) said it was a nice place to train and to live. I said he should stay there."" Former Chechen rebel: 'I have nothing to do with' Boston bombings . The FBI opened an investigation into the incident after the killing -- standard procedure in any shooting that involves an agent. ""While this internal review process is occurring, we cannot comment regarding investigative details,"" FBI spokesman Paul Bresson said Wednesday. ""The FBI takes very seriously any shooting incidents involving our agents and as such we have an effective, time-tested process for addressing them internally. The review process is thorough and objective and conducted as expeditiously as possible under the circumstances."" Todashev and Tsarnaev had become acquainted at a mixed martial arts center near Boston, said a source who was briefed on the bombing investigation. Todashev had Tsarnaev's phone number in his cell phone, the source said. Todashev was from the Chechnya region, as were Tamerlan and Dzhokar Tsarnaev, the source said. Dzhokhar, Tamerlan's brother, is a suspect in the April bombings in Boston. Abdulbaki Todashev doesn't believe his son admitted to any involvement in the Waltham triple homicide, saying ""the FBI can say anything now because a dead person can't defend himself."" That said, the father said he believes ""there are lots of honest workers"" in U.S. law enforcement who he thinks ""can be trusted (to) conduct a fair investigation"" into his son's death. ""I do want justice,"" Abdulbaki Todashev told CNN. ""I've always taught my children about justice. I do believe in it."" CNN's Phil Black reported from Moscow, and Carol Cratty reported from Washington. CNN's Greg Botelho and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","Todashev's father says his son wasn't ""crazy,"" wouldn't attack officers .

"With a single phrase, Rachel Jeantel, that friend of Trayvon Martin's, may have lit a fuse in the trial of his accused killer. Asked by the defense what Martin told her on the phone that night when he first spotted George Zimmerman, she testified a ""creepy-ass cracker"" was following him.  There is nothing illegal about that.  Jeantel said she didn't even know it was a racial slur, and numerous commentators have noted that some in Florida use the term in a non-derogatory, colloquial sense. But for plenty of rural, white southerners, ""cracker"" is a demeaning, bigoted term, and its appearance does nothing to help the prosecutors. The origin of cracker is murky.  Some sources suggest it came from overseers who commanded slaves.  Others say it derives from a Scottish word for boasting.  At The Center for the Study of the American South at the University of North Carolina, Bill Ferris says it emerged in the 1700s as a descriptive term for drovers who used small whips to move their livestock through the pine barrens along the Gulf of Mexico.  ""They were basically poor people.  White people.  A class of people who were landless."" Initially, cracker was not a pejorative term, but Ferris says it has become one, the equivalent of redneck. Its meaning and intensity as an insult depends on who is saying it and who is listening.  For example, a white who might not object to being called a cracker by another white might consider Martin's use of the phrase offensive and evidence of ill intent. In the circumstances described in court, Ferris notes, it was more likely a quick way for Martin to say he was in danger.  ""If it is used by blacks (among themselves), it is usually with one meaning: Watch out.  He didn't say it to Zimmerman.  He said it to convey a message to a friend.  He said, 'trouble is coming.'"" Still, even if Martin knew precisely what the term meant and said it with all the venom he could muster, does that matter? Maybe.  Under Florida's hate crime laws, Martin's words could potentially have been used against him had he survived the encounter and Zimmerman had taken the worst of it.  That may seem far-fetched, but a state handbook advises that a hate crime may have occurred ""if the commission of (a) felony or misdemeanor evidences prejudice based on the race, color, ancestry, ethnicity..."" Complicating the matter further: Despite suspicions among many case watchers that Zimmerman followed Martin largely because he was African-American, the only mention of race from the defendant in his call to the police that night about a ""suspicious guy"" came when he was questioned.  ""This guy,"" the dispatcher asks, ""is he white, black, or Hispanic?""  Zimmerman responds, ""He looks black."" Where did the N-word come from? All of this may seem pointless to people who focus on the central fact of this case: No matter how the conflict began, police say it ended with an armed man killing an unarmed one.  The debate over cracker may furthermore seem arcane to people who live north of the Mason-Dixon line, where cracker is seldom heard, and even when it makes an appearance, it is not freighted with decades of history.  To be sure, cracker is not on par with the n-word, but it is nonetheless a sharp racial insult that resonates with white southerners even if white northerners don't get it. That said, ask Ferris what impact the word will ultimately have on public opinions of this trial, and he is succinct.  ""I would say none.""  Views of justice, he says, are inextricably linked to racial attitudes.  Many blacks will see this trial one way, many whites another way, just as they did in the case of O.J. Simpson. But the broader public does not matter.  What matters is the jury.  And it is hard to imagine how it can help the prosecution for those six southern women to know Martin spent some of his final moments uttering a racial insult, no matter what he intended.","Trayvon Martin's friend said he described George Zimmerman as a ""creepy-ass cracker""

"Robin Williams was sober but was struggling with depression, anxiety and the early stages of Parkinson's disease when he died, his widow said Thursday. The diagnosis of the progressive illness was ""an additional fear and burden in his life,"" a person familiar with Williams' family told CNN on Thursday. Williams was found dead in his Northern California home Monday from what investigators suspect was a suicide by hanging. While fans and friends have looked for answers to why the 63-year-old comedy icon would take his own life, his wife, Susan Schneider, issued a written statement about Williams' health that he had kept a secret. ""Since his passing, all of us who loved Robin have found some solace in the tremendous outpouring of affection and admiration for him from the millions of people whose lives he touched,"" Schneider said. ""His greatest legacy, besides his three children, is the joy and happiness he offered to others, particularly to those fighting personal battles. ""Robin's sobriety was intact and he was brave as he struggled with his own battles of depression, anxiety as well as early stages of Parkinson's disease, which he was not yet ready to share publicly. ""It is our hope in the wake of Robin's tragic passing, that others will find the strength to seek the care and support they need to treat whatever battles they are facing so they may feel less afraid."" Williams had been active as an actor in the last year of his life, performing in a CBS sitcom that was canceled this year and acting in four films that have yet to hit theaters. It is not clear whether the early-stage Parkinson's disease affected his ability to work. ""Friends and family can usually detect changes in the Parkinson's patient including poor posture, loss of balance, and abnormal facial expressions,"" according to the National Parkinson Foundation. ""During this initial phase of the disease, a patient usually experiences mild symptoms.  These symptoms may inconvenience the day-to-day tasks the patient would otherwise complete with ease. Typically these symptoms will include the presence of tremors or experiencing shaking in one of the limbs."" Parkinson's disease ""causes certain brain cells to die,"" according to the website of the National Institutes of Health.  It is more likely to affect men than women and most often develops after age 50. Williams used exercise and cycling to manage his stress and depression, and the prospect that the illness would prevent him from doing that was extremely upsetting, adding to the depression, the person familiar with his family said. What is Parkinson's disease? Fellow actor Michael J. Fox, who has Parkinson's and established the Michael J. Fox Foundation, said Thursday that he was unaware of his friend's condition. ""Stunned to learn Robin had PD. Pretty sure his support for our Fdn predated his diagnosis. A true friend; I wish him peace,"" Fox tweeted. Investigators believe Williams used a belt to hang himself from a bedroom door sometime between late Sunday and when his personal assistant found him just before noon Monday, according to Marin County Assistant Deputy Chief Coroner Lt. Keith Boyd. Boyd would not confirm or deny whether Williams left behind a letter, saying that investigators would discuss ""the note or a note"" later. The coroner's investigation ""revealed he had been seeking treatment for depression,"" Boyd said. He spent time in a treatment facility in July, a time when his wife and representative have said he was battling depression. Media reports at the time speculated that Williams had resumed drinking alcohol, but the statement from his wife appears to dispute those reports. Williams entered rehab because of drug and alcohol addiction at least twice previously. ""Robin spent so much of his life helping others,"" his wife said. Whether he was entertaining millions on stage, film or television, our troops on the front lines, or comforting a sick child -- Robin wanted us to laugh and to feel less afraid.""

"FOUNTAIN HILLS, Arizona (CNN) -- A team of doctors from the Mayo Clinic declared Friday that there appears to be no physical reason why Sen. John McCain, the 71-year-old presumed Republican presidential candidate, could not carry out the duties of the office. ""Sen. McCain enjoys excellent health and displays extraordinary energy, and, while it is impossible to predict any person's future health, I and my colleagues can find no medical reason or problem that would preclude Sen. McCain from fulfilling all of the duties or obligations of the president of the United States,"" said Dr. John D. Eckstein, an internist who has been overseeing McCain's treatment for 16 years at the famed research center's campus in Scottsdale, Arizona. McCain has been undergoing periodic examinations there since the 1990s and annual examinations since 2000, Eckstein said. His most recent comprehensive examination took place in March, with follow-up tests this month. The doctors described a number of health issues faced by McCain, many of them typical for a man of his age but at least one of them potentially serious. McCain has had four malignant melanomas removed. Three of them -- on his left shoulder, left arm and left nasal wall -- were limited to the top skin layer and were not invasive. They were removed in 1993, 2000 and 2002, and all were declared Stage 0, of little long-term concern. But a fourth melanoma proved to be invasive and was removed from his left lower temple in 2000, Eckstein said. The surgery on McCain's temple was carried out in August 2000 by Dr. Michael Hinni, who described the melanoma as 2.2 mm thick at the thickest point and 2 cm across. Hinni said that, in order to leave a 2 cm margin that would minimize the risk of leaving some of the cancer intact, he had to remove a patch of skin roughly 6 cm in diameter, as well as an underlying carotid salivary gland from McCain's face. Dissection of dozens of lymph nodes showed no evidence that the cancer had spread, he said. According to the American Cancer Society, such a melanoma would be classified as Stage IIA, which is associated with a five-year survival rate of about 78 percent and a 10-year survival rate of about 66 percent. The wound required major reconstruction and has left the senator with a mass of scar tissue on his face. His left jaw appears prominent because because there was an absence of soft tissue on the face in front of his ear, Hinni said. CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta, who reviewed McCain's medical records, found previously unreported details about the operation.  Watch Dr. Sanjay Gupta on McCain's health records » . McCain developed swelling beneath the skin and had to be taken back for a second operation. One in 58 Americans will develop malignant melanoma in their lifetime, said Dr. Suzanne Connolly, McCain's dermatologist. This year, an estimated 116,500 cases will be diagnosed in the United States, with more than 62,000 of them invasive, she said. McCain has many of the risk factors associated with the cancer: light skin, light-colored eyes and a history of excessive sun exposure, she said. Though there is no sign of recurrence, McCain monitors his skin carefully, is examined by his dermatologist every three to four months and ""practices good habits of sun safety,"" she said. Connolly described the candidate's prognosis as good. ""There is no way to predict with certainty the percentage, but the percentage would be thought to be in the single-digit area,"" she said. McCain has also been treated for other less serious skin cancers, but Eckstein did not specify how many. McCain has had a number of more routine interactions with his doctors, not unusual for a man of his age. He has had four small kidney stones in his right kidney and a number of small benign cysts in both kidneys, but his kidney function is normal, Eckstein said. In August 2001, McCain noticed blood in his urine, and doctors found stones in his bladder that they used lasers to break apart. At the same time, they surgically removed enlarged prostate tissue, which was the cause of the bleeding, Eckstein said. Since then, McCain's urination has been normal, Eckstein said. McCain's prostate has showed no signs of cancer, and his prostate-specific antigen test -- which can indicate prostate cancer risk -- was also normal, Eckstein said. He said McCain takes the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide to prevent the formation of kidney stones. He takes the diuretic in a 25 mg dose, which is also the standard for treating high blood pressure. Eckstein said that, though McCain's systolic rate -- the top number in a blood pressure reading -- had sometimes been slightly high, the drug was being prescribed solely for kidney stone prevention. He added that he has encouraged McCain to reduce his salt intake, another method of lowering blood pressure. McCain first had an adenomatous colon polyp removed in the 1990s. Though the next two tests -- performed years apart -- proved negative, the most recent test carried out last month revealed six of the polyps, all of which were removed, Eckstein said. Though the polyps were all of the type that are potentially precancerous, they were found so early that they pose little threat, he said. McCain will continue to have periodic colonoscopies, the doctor said. McCain has displayed no evidence of heart disease or other cardiovascular disease, Eckstein said. ""Indeed, he walked the Grand Canyon rim to rim in August 2006"" and hikes whenever his schedule permits, he said. A stress echocardiogram carried out in March was ""entirely normal,"" he said. McCain has also been treated for high lipid levels. Eckstein said he originally prescribed Vytorin, but a recent study raised questions about its efficacy, and he recently switched the Republican candidate to simvastatin. McCain has had orthopedic problems in the past, many of them traced to October 1967, when the Navy flier's plane was shot down over Vietnam. He broke both arms and a leg when he ejected and spent the next 5½ years as a prisoner of war in Hanoi. During that time, he was beaten and tortured repeatedly, suffering fractures of both shoulders. Because he received no treatment for his fractures, they healed improperly, leaving him with reduced range of motion for his shoulders, arms and right knee, Eckstein said. McCain takes a daily aspirin to prevent formation of blood clots; an occasional Zyrtec, an antihistamine used for nasal allergies; and the sleep agent Ambien CR for treatment of insomnia when he travels. He also takes a multi-vitamin tablet. Some reporters, including CNN's, were allowed to examine McCain's medical records. In one, McCain's fasting blood sugar value was described as ""impaired."" Asked to elaborate, Eckstein said he thought that the note referred to a 111 mg/dl blood sugar, with normals ""in most labs"" being between 70 mg/dl and 100 mg/dl. Eckstein said he followed that test result with another that he did not identify, ""which was completely normal."" McCain, a two-pack-a-day smoker for 25 years, quit in 1980. He recently had a CT scan of his chest performed, and it proved normal, Eckstein said. The former pilot also sometimes experiences occasional dizziness when he stands, a benign condition called positional vertigo, Eckstein said. ""When he and many other people arise from sitting or lying down, they get a sudden whirling sensation which may last two to five seconds and then disappears,"" he said. ""It does not indicate any vascular problem to the brain, and it is not a precursor to stroke."" McCain's father died of a stroke at age 70, but his 96-year-old mother is in good health and has appeared on the campaign trail with him. McCain released his medical records voluntarily. He did the same when he ran for president in 2000. The two Democrats competing for their party's nomination, Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. Hillary Clinton, have not released their doctors' files. Obama's campaign said it will release a summary of his medical condition next week, composed by his primary care physician. The campaign said it will show that he is in good health.","Sen.

"At the edge of the heliosphere, you wouldn't know by looking whether you left the cradle of humanity behind and floated out into interstellar space. You would just see unfathomably empty space, no matter which side of the invisible line you were on. But scientists now have strong evidence that NASA's Voyager 1 probe has crossed this important border, making history as the first human-made object to leave the heliosphere, the magnetic boundary separating the solar system's sun, planets and solar wind from the rest of the galaxy. ""In leaving the heliosphere and setting sail on the cosmic seas between the stars, Voyager has joined other historic journeys of exploration: The first circumnavigation of the Earth, the first steps on the Moon,"" said Ed Stone, chief scientist on the Voyager mission. ""That's the kind of event this is, as we leave behind our solar bubble."" A new study in the journal Science suggests that the probe entered the interstellar medium around August 25, 2012. You may have heard other reports that Voyager 1 has made the historic crossing before, but Thursday was the first time NASA announced it. The twin spacecraft Voyager 1 and 2 were launched in 1977, 16 days apart. As of Thursday, according to NASA's real-time odometer, Voyager 1 is 18.8 billion kilometers (11.7 billion miles) from Earth. Its sibling, Voyager 2, is 15.3 billion (9.5 billion) kilometers from our planet. Voyager 1 is being hailed as the first probe to leave the solar system. But under a stricter definition of ""solar system,"" which includes the distant comets that orbit the sun, we'd have to wait another 30,000 years for it to get that far, Stone said. Another milestone for long after we're gone: The probe will fly near a star in about 40,000 years, Stone said. How do we know? Voyager, currently traveling at more than 38,000 miles per hour, never sent a postcard saying ""Greetings from interstellar space!"" So whether it has made the historic crossing or not is a matter of controversy. ""The spacecraft itself really doesn't know,"" Stone said. ""It's only instruments that can tell us whether we're inside or outside."" Further complicating matters, the device aboard Voyager 1 that measures plasma -- a state of matter with charged particles -- broke in 1980. To get around that, scientists detected waves in the plasma around the spacecraft and used that information to calculate density. Vibrations in the plasma came from a large coronal mass ejection from the sun in 2012, resulting in what Stone called a ""solar wind tsunami."" These vibrations reached the area around Voyager this spring. Measurements taken between April 9 and May 22 of this year show that Voyager 1 was, at that time, located in an area with an electron density of about 0.08 per cubic centimeter. In the interstellar medium, the density of electrons is thought to be between 0.05 and 0.22 per cubic centimeter. The particles of interstellar plasma were created by the explosions of giant stars, and carry the magnetic field of the galaxy, scientists said. Last year, between October 23 and November 27, researchers calculate that Voyager 1 was in an area with an electron density of 0.06 per cubic centimeter. That's still within the interstellar space range, and it means that over time the spacecraft passed through plasma with increasing electron density. The study, led by University of Iowa physicist Donald Gurnett, suggests that the plasma density is about 30 times higher in the interstellar medium than in the heliosphere, which is close to what scientists thought based on other kinds of measurements. The boundary is called the heliopause. Voyager mission timeline: . When did it happen? Scientists have been using several kinds of measurements to figure out if and when Voyager 1 had reached the interstellar medium. Evidence from particle data had already pointed toward the conclusion that the probe succeeded. In late July and early August of 2012, scientists saw dips in the concentration of particles made in the solar system, and peaks in particles made outside. ""If you just looked at that data, you'd think it's pretty clear that we've actually crossed a boundary. We're no longer in the place where the solar system particles are being made, and we're actually out in the interstellar medium,"" said Marc Swisdak, associate research scientist in the Institute for Research in Electronics and Applied Physics at the University of Maryland. Swisdak was not involved in the new study, but has worked with Voyager data. Magnetic field measurements suggested otherwise. Researchers had expected to see stark changes in magnetic field direction when the probe crossed out of the heliosphere, but that wasn't supported by measurements from the probe. Swisdak and colleagues published a modeling study suggesting that the particle data is more relevant, and that the magnetic field might not change as much as people thought. They proposed a crossing-over date of July 27 -- about a month sooner than the new study. The specific date will likely be debated for some time, Swisdak said. One possible explanation is that if the heliosphere is analogous to an air-conditioned room, Voyager stepped through the doorway into a hot room on July 27. For a month it was in a metaphorical room with a mixture of hot and cold air, and finally entered the truly hot part on August 25. Puzzles still surround the magnetic field at the edge of the heliosphere, Stone said, and ""We're going to be prepared to have more surprises."" NASA sends unmanned rocket to the moon . What else is out there? Voyager 1 has only 68 KB of memory on board -- far less than a smartphone, said Suzanne Dodd, Voyager project manager. Scientists communicate with the spacecraft every day. ""It's the little spacecraft that could,"" she said in a NASA press conference. The probe now has a totally new mission, Stone said. ""We're now on the first mission to explore interstellar space,"" he said. ""We will now look and learn in detail how the wind which is outside, that came from these other stars, is deflected around the heliosphere."" Wind -- made of particles -- from these other stars has to go around the heliosphere the way a water in a stream flows around a rock, Stone said. Scientists are interested in learning more about the interaction between our solar wind and wind from other stars. Natural radioactive decay provides heat that generates enough electricity to help Voyager 1 communicate with Earth. The first science instrument will be turned off in 2020, and the last one will be shut down in 2025, Stone said. Both Voyager probes carry time capsules known as ""the golden record,"" a 12-inch, gold-plated copper disc with images and sounds so that extraterrestrials could learn about us. Let's hope they can build appropriate record players. Voyager 2 will likely leave the heliosphere in about three to four years, Stone said. Its plasma instrument is still working, Stone said, so scientists can directly measure the stellar wind's density, speed and temperature. That also means that when it crosses out of the heliosphere, Voyager 2 will send a clearer signal.

"The final stockpile of Syria's chemical weapons has been shipped out of the country, according to the OPCW, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Ahmet Uzumcu, the chief of the international watchdog organization, said the weapons were loaded Monday aboard the Danish ship Ark Futura and departed the Syrian port of Latakia. ""A major landmark has been reached today,"" Uzumcu said, qualifying that that meant all ""declared"" weapons were out of the country. ""We cannot say for sure it has no more chemical weapons,"" Uzumcu said. ""All we can do is work on the basis of verifying a country's declarations of what they have. I would not make any speculation to possible remaining assets, substances, chemical weapons. ... "" It has been more than a year since the Obama administration said that Syria had crossed a ""red line"" with its use of chemical weapons during the nation's civil war, which has raged since 2011. In August 2013, U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky told reporters that a team of experts had gathered to go to Syria to investigate reports of chemical weapons. Later that month, video and witness accounts appeared to support the allegations that scores of people killed outside the Syrian capital of Damascus had been poisoned with chemical weapons. The nonpartisan Doctors Without Borders then reported that three hospitals near Damascus treated more than 3,000 patients suffering ""neurotoxic symptoms."" In September, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon released the inspectors' report, which says there is ""clear and convincing evidence"" that sarin, a nerve agent developed for chemical warfare, was used in the Damascus attack. Later that month, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution requiring Syria to eliminate its chemical weapons arsenal, and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad promised to adhere to the resolution. The following month, Syria began dismantling its chemical weapons program. The OPCW reported that Syrians were using torches and grinders to destroy or disable weapons such as missile warheads and aerial bombs. But in February, the OPCW told CNN that Syria had shipped out only 11% of its chemical weapons stockpile. That happened after a February deadline ordering that all chemical arms be removed from Syria had passed. While Monday brought an apparent end to a chapter regarding Syria's chemical weapons, talks to achieve some semblance of peace in the country continue and, on the ground in Syria, trauma and bloodshed continue. On June 20 in New York, Ban gave an impassioned speech about the war in Syria. It's possible that more than 150,000 people have died since the war began, but the U.N. chief said it may be impossible to get an exact count of how many have lost their lives. Half of Syria's population of 22 million has been displaced, and a flood of refugees are struggling to put their lives back together in neighboring countries such as Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan and Iraq, Ban said. ""The international community must not abandon the people of Syria and the region to never-ending waves of cruelty and crisis,"" he implored. ""The greatest obstacle to ending the Syria war is the notion that it can be won militarily. ... ""No one is winning; no one can win. Even if one side were to prevail in the short term, the devastating toll will have sown the seeds of future conflict.""","Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons: Stockpile has left Syrian port of Latakia .

"Disney World is looking into reports that some wealthy visitors are hiring disabled people to pretend to be family members so that they can skip lines. ""It is unacceptable to abuse accommodations that were designed for guests with disabilities,"" spokesman Bryan Malenius told CNN Wednesday.  ""We are thoroughly reviewing the situation and will take appropriate steps to deter this type of activity."" Reports of the alleged practice sparked fury on social media, with some people calling the actions ""crazy,"" ""awful,"" and ""despicable."" But others defended the idea, arguing it's a way to help some disabled people make good money. The debate began with an article in the New York Post. ""The black-market Disney guides run $130 an hour, or $1,040 for an eight-hour day,"" the report said. Social researcher Wednesday Martin ""caught wind of the underground network"" while working on a book about practices among New York City's Park Avenue elite, the Post reported. ""It really is happening,"" Martin told CNN's ""Starting Point"" Wednesday. ""I live among the privileged and powerful parents of New York City,"" she said, ""and once in a while I come across a practice that's really surprising."" She added, ""It's not my job to judge."" To Disney or not to Disney? Disney for the '1%' The Post anonymously quoted one mother as saying, ""My daughter waited one minute to get on 'It's a Small World' -- the other kids had to wait 2 1/2 hours.  You can't go to Disney without a tour concierge. This is how the 1% does Disney."" The woman said she hired a company called Dream Tours, the Post reported. The Florida company did not respond immediately to CNN's requests for comment.  But it posted a note on its website saying, ""Due to inaccurate press and slander, Dream Tours is not offering VIP tours at this time. Our focus has primarily always been providing magical vacations for adults with special needs and helping their dreams to come true."" Ryan Clement runs Dream Tours, and Jacie Christiano is assistant director, according to the website.  The Post reported that Christiano served as a tour guide for the mother whom the paper quoted anonymously.  Clement told the Post that Christiano has an auto-immune disorder and uses a scooter on the job, the report said. Disney offers official ways to avoid long lines . It's unclear how often the alleged practice may have actually taken place. The theme park offers VIP tours and FastPass service allowing people to avoid long lines.

And Twitter user Ruth summed up her take in two words: ""Con artists!"" But others had a different view.

And jessied44 wrote, ""$1040 for a day spent having fun -- not a bad job.

"Eccentric Chinese tycoon Chen Guangbiao took out a full-page bilingual advertisement in the New York Times, inviting underprivileged Americans to a charity lunch and offering cash handouts. According to Chinese media reports, the ad appeared in the New York Times print edition on Monday, announcing that Chen would host a charity luncheon at New York Central Park's Loeb Boathouse on June 25 for 1,000 ""poor and destitute Americans"". Each participant would also receive $300. Chen, who is known for theatrical philanthropic stunts, has a photo of himself in the ad placed side-by-side with a picture of Lei Feng, a Chinese soldier from the Mao-era who is celebrated as a selfless model citizen. The title above the images says, ""China's 'Lei Feng for a new era.'"" Those who wish to join the luncheon need to RSVP via a Hotmail email address. Chen said he was hoping the lunch would show the U.S. that there are Chinese philanthropists. ""There are many wealthy Chinese billionaires but most of them gained their wealth from market speculation and colluding with government officials while destroying the environment. I can't bear the sight of it,"" Chen told the South China Morning Post. Making his fortune from recycling domestic waste and construction materials in China, Chen has been in the media spotlight in recent years for his dramatic publicity stunts promoting philanthropic causes. He arrived at the scene of the 2013 Lushan earthquake in Sichuan just hours after the disaster took place and personally handed out cash to the victims. Chen has also tried unsuccessfully to buy the New York Times as part of his ongoing campaign to develop closer ties between U.S. and China. He recently expressed a desire to reignite discussions to buy the paper's opinion section and fill it with articles about environmental protection and charity. Founder of the Huangpu Renewable Resources Utilization Group, Chen has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to various charitable causes over the years and has made it more than once onto Forbes' list of Asia's leading philanthropists. But not everyone is taken with Chen's flashy generosity. Jeremy Goldkorn, director of Chinese media research firm Danwei, says: ""Chen is a clown whose so-called philanthropy appears to consist entirely of self-promotional stunts like giving handouts of cash in Taipei and New York, and cans of air to people in China."" Goldkorn has also tweeted that Chen is the ""greatest insult to the Chinese people."" Other critics find it difficult to take Chen seriously when his English namecard lists an absurdly long string of self-aggrandizing titles, including ""Most Charismatic Philanthropist of China.""","Controversial millionaire Chen Guangbiao is known for theatrical philanthropic stunts .

"A prosecutor in Texas wants Adrian Peterson arrested and his bond revoked after the NFL star allegedly admitted to smoking marijuana while out on bail on a felony child abuse charge. Montgomery County District Attorney Brett Ligon sent a motion to the 9th District Court to set aside the NFL star's bail, saying Peterson told an employee of a company that does drug testing that he ""smoked a little weed."" Peterson posted $15,000 bail on September 12. Ligon said Peterson's reported admission before giving a urine sample on Wednesday amounts to grounds for revocation of the bond. One of Peterson's attorneys, Rusty Hardin, said he had no comment on the latest development in the case, which is tentatively scheduled to go to trial on December 1. In his motion, Ligon said Texas law allows a judge to ""order the accused to be rearrested, and require the accused to give another bond."" It is unclear when a judge will rule on Ligon's request. There also is a motion from Ligon for Judge Kelly Case to recuse himself. A hearing was set for November. Peterson trial to begin in December if judge isn't nixed for 'media whores' jab . Peterson -- who in 2011 signed a seven-year contract worth more than $100 million and is considered one of the NFL's best running backs, if not the best -- left the Minnesota Vikings last month after the team deactivated, then activated and deactivated him again after accusations that he whipped his 4-year-old son with a ""switch,"" or slender tree branch. The Vikings didn't immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. Authorities have not divulged details of the case against Peterson, but photos obtained by TMZ allegedly show Peterson's son's leg covered in marks, some of which appeared to have broken the skin. Peterson turned himself in and was released on a $15,000 bond. According to Texas law, people can be convicted of injury to a child if they cause bodily or mental injury ""intentionally, knowingly, recklessly or with criminal negligence"" or cause such harm by omission. The crime is punishable by up to two years in a state jail and a $1,000 fine. Hardin has said his client never meant to harm the boy and was simply doling out discipline much like ""he experienced as a child growing up in East Texas.""

"When Jim Whittaker became the first American to stand on top of Mount Everest 50 years ago, he was anything but elated. Reaching Earth's highest point only 10 years after New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary became the first to summit along with Tenzing Norgay, Whittaker said 50 mph winds were ""blowing like hell,"" compounding the already outrageous temperature of 35 below zero. The jetstream blasted Whittaker and Sherpa Nawang Gombu as Whittaker pounded the pick of his American flag  into the ice. But when the two men looked down from their perch, 29,028 feet above sea level, they realized summiting was not their journey's end. They still had far to go, and they'd just run out of bottled oxygen on top of the world. ""Oh, boy, we've got to get down,"" Whittaker thought. ""Getting to the summit is half of the climb. You're working so hard to get up, you don't really think about anything else."" Mount Everest, by the numbers . Whittaker's expedition members' childhoods had been filled with a passion for climbing. Richard Pownall was bitten by the mountaineering bug in 1943 when an English teacher sent students to the library to pick out a book. After reading about climbing, Pownall got a summer job working at Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming, but that stint couldn't sate his curiosity and zeal for exploration. Whittaker discovered his passion at 14, scaling the peaks of the Northwest U.S. and, later, while guiding people up Mount Rainier in college. After summiting Mount McKinley, the highest U.S. peak, the next natural step was ""the big one,"" he said. When the Americans began scaling Everest, their journey was far different from that of today's climbers. For one, they were the only team on the mountain at the time. They also had to trek 185 miles through the sweltering Chitwa Jungle, their packs stuffed with cold-weather gear for when the elevation rose. That's about the distance from Seattle, Washington, to Portland, Oregon, though the Nepalese trek involves pathways along 18,000-foot ridges, Whittaker pointed out. Today, climbers fly 140 miles into Nepal and trek 40 miles into base camp. 80-year-old Japanese man becomes oldest to climb Mount Everest . Once at Everest, it wasn't long before Whittaker's expedition experienced disaster. Two days into the climb, three men were opening a route through the Khumbu Icefall -- where descending glaciers break off into jagged, car- and house-sized chunks -- when glacier pieces collapsed around them, burying them in ice, Pownall said. He was able to climb out, but ended his summit attempt. Jake Breitenbach, a 27-year-old guide from Jackson, Wyoming, didn't survive. He was buried deep in the ice. His body wouldn't be recovered until much later. ""You're halfway around the world,"" Whittaker said. ""You immediately think of your family."" They were all shaken, but Everest's fierce conditions forbade them from dwelling on it. They had to keep moving. They could mourn later. Though the view from the peak is spectacular, the Himalayas and Nepal unfolding beneath them, Whittaker said his team was more amazed by the scenery on their way back down. After months of living in thin air, they noticed the air became thicker and softer as the oxygen increased. At one point, they found themselves clustered, looking down at a little blade of grass coming up through the scree. ""This green, emerald green -- God, it was just incredible,"" Whittaker said. ""There is nothing growing up above, no color -- it's all snow, ice and rock. We were in tears. We had lost Jake up on the mountain but now we were coming back into life, this beautiful, lush, gorgeous planet that supports life. A little blade of grass just stunned the whole team."" Almost 49 years after summiting Everest, Whittaker, then-83, found himself back at base camp in 2012. His son, Leif, 27, wanted to reach the so-called ""Head of the Sky"" for a second time. Leif Whittaker had done it without his father in 2010. Whittaker and his son had trekked to a base camp in 2003, but they had no intention of summiting. First Saudi woman summits Mount Everest . Whittaker said he never encouraged or discouraged his son from mountaineering, but his son discovered it for himself at age 15. After being asked so many times if he'd follow in his dad's footsteps up the face of Everest, Leif found his answer on their 2003 trip. ""It was the natural power and majesty of that place that I felt some special connection to,"" Leif said. ""I think we all are affected by landscapes in a different way, and for me, a boy who had grown up with that idea of Mount Everest in his head, seeing Everest for the first time made me want to climb it."" Whittaker hoped to walk into base camp with his son in 2012, but a day from their destination, he caught an intestinal bug. The seasoned mountaineer who had once conquered Everest was within him, telling him to keep going, but he decided it was too dicey. Meanwhile, Leif Whittaker faced a different danger: overcrowding. Ten people died on Everest in 2012, raising questions about how many people should receive permits to scale the perilous peak. Everest climbers, widower recount deadly traffic jam on top of the world in 2012 . Leif waited for more than an hour at 28,700 feet, just below the summit, as 100 people slowly descended the tricky Hillary Step. If it hadn't been for calm winds May 26, the last window of good weather, he would have been forced back down. ""Each person climbs Everest for different reasons. The reason that I climb is because I love the mountain, I love what comes with it: the view from the top, the camaraderie of good teammates, the personal challenge of the experience, pushing past your own boundaries and growing because of that experience."" Father and son experienced the magnitude of emotion that comes with being at Everest together, and Whittaker is proud his son reached the summit twice. While the achievement continues the family legacy, Whittaker wanted his children to appreciate the life around them. ""I came back from Everest without ego because you realize how insignificant you are, just a speck in the vast universe,"" Whittaker said. ""You dwell in the silence of the forest and the high mountains. They are the highest cathedrals in the world.""

"In a scathing report, the U.S. Department of Justice on Monday accused the East Haven Police Department (EHPD) in Connecticut of engaging in a pattern of widespread discrimination against Latinos in violation of the Constitution and federal law. ""We find that EHPD engages in discriminatory policing against Latinos, including but not limited to targeting Latinos for discriminatory traffic enforcement, treating Latino drivers more harshly than non-Latino drivers after a traffic stop, and intentionally and woefully failing to design and implement internal systems of control that would identify, track, and prevent such misconduct,"" Assistant Attorney General Thomas J. Perez wrote in a 23-page letter to the East Haven mayor, detailing the results of a two-year investigation. The letter described the discrimination as ""deeply rooted in the Department's culture,"" and cited a statistical analysis showing how Latinos were ""intentionally targeted"" for traffic stops. It provided the example of a particular officer's stops -- 40.5% of which were of Latino drivers. Overall, the investigation found that 19.9% of traffic stops made by the EHPD were of Latino drivers, concluding it ""shows pervasive discrimination against Latinos on every level of EHPD traffic enforcement activity.""  The report also said officers were able to target Latinos by focusing on customers leaving Latino businesses. In addition to the high rate of traffic stops, the report accused some EHPD officers of conducting unauthorized immigration investigations. The report mentioned ""numerous incident reports"" where EHPD officers contacted Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to check on the status or seek an immigration detention of a Latino person.  Investigators said the tactic was ""used to harass and intimidate Latinos rather than pursue legitimate law enforcement objectives."" The analysis of the police department's practices against the Latino community said the Connecticut department, at the very least, turned a blind eye to the blatant cases of biased policing and at worst, enabled it.  It also accused the department's leadership of thwarting the investigation by ""creating a hostile and intimidating environment"" for anyone willing to cooperate with it. CNN reached out to the East Haven Police Department multiple times for comment on Monday. It did not respond. According to 2010 census data, East Haven has a population of some 29,000 people. The vast majority of residents, 88.5%, are white, while 10.3% of the population identifies as Hispanic or Latino.  Close to 3% of residents identify as black or African-American. The findings come on the heels of a federal investigation that began more than two years ago, involving a massive review of EHPD incident reports, documents and interviews of department personnel. The Justice Department said it will meet with community leaders, as well with as municipal agencies to address the concerns raised in the report.  But the federal agency also made clear that the United States may suspend or terminate federal funding if the town fails to address the civil rights violations.","Federal officials accuse police in East Haven of discrimination .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- A group of Iranian intellectuals released a public apology this week for what they say is a long history of the country's mistreatment of members of the Baha'i faith. The letter lists 11 reasons why its signatories are ashamed of the past treatment of Baha'is. The apology -- titled, ""We are ashamed"" -- was published on the Web site Iranian.com and was signed by 42 Iranian professionals, all of whom do not live in Iran. ""As Iranian human beings, we are ashamed for what has been perpetrated upon the Baha'is in the last century and a half in Iran,"" the letter says. In the letter, the group detailed incidents of violence and discrimination that it says the Iranian government has perpetrated against Baha'is. The Islamic republic has been condemned by human-rights activists and governments across the globe for its treatment of members of the Baha'i faith. The Baha'i movement has said that six of its followers were arrested in January in Tehran, including one who works with Nobel peace laureate Shirin Ebadi, the lawyer and activist. Seven leaders of the group arrested in 2008 also remain in jail. Members of Baha'i -- who say they are targeted in the predominantly Shiite nation because of their faith -- have faced arrests and other oppression over the years. They say the persecution is part of a pattern that began in 1979. That's when the monarchy of the Shah of Iran was toppled and an Islamic republic was created. Baha'i -- regarded as the largest non-Muslim religious minority in Iran -- claims to have 5 million members across the globe and about 300,000 in Iran. The European Parliament passed a resolution in January that criticized Iran's treatment of Baha'is. The U.S. State Department also criticized Iran's treatment of Baha'i followers in a report last year.

"(CNN) -- The hottest music venue in Europe opened its doors on Thursday morning to a select group in the United States. Spotify, which makes Internet music-streaming software, launched the much-hyped U.S. version of its service after delays and years of negotiation. At first, Spotify will only accept new members to its free service who receive invitations from the company, one of its sponsors or a current user. ""This is the biggest market in the world,"" Kenneth Parks, Spotify's content chief, said in an interview late Wednesday. ""We haven't done a launch this large."" Google+, the new social network, also launched recently using an invite-only scheme. Spotify plans to welcome everyone for free after ""several weeks,"" Parks said. The Spotify computer program will let people choose from any of 15 million songs to hear for free -- up to 10 hours per month, with each track listenable up to five times. For the first six months, however, people who enter during the invitation period are exempt from the monthly limit, Parks said. After that, users can lift the restrictions by paying $5 a month or buying songs individually, like iTunes. The smartphone apps can be accessed for $10 a month, which includes unlimited streaming and the ability to save copy-protected music for listening offline. The ability to create and share playlists with Facebook friends has formed a beehive mix-tape culture among the more than 10 million users in Europe. From a small office in Stockholm, Sweden, Spotify quickly spread its tentacles across Europe. But during the past couple of years, the company has been caught in a web of bureaucracy. Record-label executives have expressed concern that Spotify's free offering devalues music and doesn't drum up significant revenue. ""They wanted to be careful,"" Parks said. ""Spotify has always had a view that the free experience was core to what Spotify was all about and key to get users to invest in the service."" Spotify CEO Daniel Ek echoed that belief at a technology conference in December, as he has in several public appearances before that and likely will again at Fortune's Brainstorm Tech conference next week. ""We really believe in our model,"" Ek said at the D: Dive into Mobile conference last year. ""We would not just launch a subscription model, because we don't think that's going to work."" Now, the four major labels and Spotify have finally settled their disputes. In the time since, the record companies have given the go-ahead to competing digital music initiatives such as Rdio, MOG and, most recently, Apple's iTunes Match. ""We think there's definitely room and appetite for a service like Spotify,"" Parks said. ""There really is nothing like it in the market.""","NEW: Spotify launches in the U.S. on Thursday morning .

"New York (CNN) -- The mother of a woman police identified as one of eight found dead on an isolated strip of waterfront property on Long Island, New York, told CNN that a man using the victim's cell phone made taunting calls and claimed he killed 24-year-old Melissa Barthelemy. ""Do you think you'll ever see her again?,"" the unidentified male caller asked Barthelemy's sister on August 26, 2009, according to Steve Cohen, an attorney for the victim's mother. ""You won't. I killed her,"" he added and hung up. The phone call ended after less than a minute. Another phone call was placed in July 2009 just days after Barthelemy disappeared. It was the first of seven calls he made from Barthelemy's cell phone. Cohen said that in the phone call the unidentified male caller referred to Barthelemy as a ""whore"" in a short conversation with her then-15-year-old sister. In the final call, the man described in graphic detail to the victim's sister what he had done sexually to Barthelemy, Cohen said. Barthelemy's mother and sister kept a journal of the calls that was turned over to police early in the investigation. The content of the calls could help police as they work to put together a profile of the suspected serial killer. Cohen described the man in the calls as ""a calculating, stone-cold killer."" ""He premeditated his acts,"" Cohen said. ""He knew what he was doing and my personal belief is that Melissa was not his first victim. He started to get good at this, and he's getting better at it."" Barthelemy was last seen alive in the Bronx Borough of New York and was later identified among three other bodies found on a quarter-mile stretch of waterfront property near Oak Beach, Long Island. The other three bodies have since been identified as Maureen Brainard-Barnes, 25, of Norwich, Connecticut; Amber Lynn Costello, 27, of North Babylon, New York; and Megan Waterman, 22, of Scarborough, Maine. The remains of at least four other people have been found on Long Island but have not been identified in an investigation that stretches back to December. The grisly finds occurred as police searched for Shannan Gilbert, 24, who was last seen alive in May in the neighboring Gilgo Beach area. Gilbert has not been located. The massive search by police and federal agents in Suffolk and Nassau counties, where the human remains located so far have been found, comes two years after the alleged phone calls. Police said in January that calls from Melissa Barthelemy's cell phone had been traced to midtown Manhattan, with the two last calls made from around Madison Square Garden and Times Square. The caller hung up too quickly for authorities to pinpoint the exact locations of the calls, police said. The victim's family has described the calls previously, but only recently revealed the admission of guilt. The four victims who have been identified were all women who advertised prostitution services on websites such as Craigslist, police have said. Meanwhile, aviation teams flying over parts of Long Island had ""identified a significant number of items that aren't natural for the area,"" said Nassau County Acting Police Commissioner Thomas Krumpter. But as of Friday, authorities had not uncovered any further human remains. Earlier this week, police discovered skeletal remains -- including a human skull -- prompting the widening search. Police have not said whether the most recent remains are from different people, or if they could have come from the eight victims found previously. Airplanes and helicopters with high-resolution technology are being used in the search effort. The remains found Monday in a Nassau County wildlife preserve were wrapped in a ""black plastic product"" similar to a plastic bag, a law enforcement source said Wednesday. The remains ""appeared to be part of a lower extremity,"" the source said. Police have said the Long Island remains are not connected to the bodies of four prostitutes found near Atlantic City, New Jersey, in 2006. Federal agents first joined police in the investigation in December after the first four bodies were found. That discovery on a quarter-mile stretch of Oak Beach indicated that ""they were dumped there by the same person or persons,"" Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer told reporters at the time. ""It's too coincidental that there were four bodies in the same location.""","The mother of a victim says a man called claiming he killed 24-year-old Melissa Barthelemy .

"This weekend, Curiosity successfully landed on Mars. Now the one-ton roving robotic laboratory, part of NASA's four-ton Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft, gets down to business. Its task? Determining whether Mars ever did or could support life. That's the big question. To quote Humphrey Bogart's Rick in ""Casablanca"": ""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world,"" why should life occur only on planet Earth? Living organisms are found in the most improbable places -- in the dark, sulfurous depths of the oceans and in the driest deserts. News: Curiosity rover lands on Mars . All it takes is some water, carbon, a few other elements and energy. In fact, the organic chemicals needed for life seem to occur naturally everywhere, even in chilly, dry interstellar space. On Earth, the first living cells followed, then multi-cell organisms, and eventually humans. So, are we alone, or not? It seems likely that life has arisen on other planets, in our solar system or near other stars or in other galaxies. It's natural to wonder what's out there. Probably, Neanderthals sat around their campfires speculating whether others roamed the land. Exploring our solar system and looking for signs of life is the lifeblood of NASA. More than a century ago, Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote about ""little green men"" on Mars and astronomers reported seeing irrigation canals through telescopes. Nowadays, we know better -- Mars certainly does not harbor walking, talking aliens, nor does any other planet or moon in our solar system, notwithstanding fictional depictions like the famous Georges Méliès movie ""A Trip to the Moon."" But Mars might harbor simpler forms of life, or might have done so in the past. And it's an entirely new environment. Most of what we know about ""habitability"" -- the ability of an environment to host and support life -- has been studied under the very different conditions on Earth. For example, scientists investigate the hyper-dry environments found in Antarctica (but there is still a lot of water, compared with Mars) or Death Valley (dry enough, but much hotter than Mars). Curiosity will explore the completely different conditions on Mars. On Sunday, the Mars Science Laboratory executed a series of maneuvers designed to slow its approach to the Mars surface. At the start, it was moving at 13,200 miles per hour, and needed to be slowed down, to keep it from ending up a smashed pile of rubble. To do this the laboratory used the thin atmosphere, which slowed it down, albeit not as effectively as the Earth's more substantial atmosphere slows re-entering spacecraft. Then it released a parachute and fired some rockets to decelerate more before gently lowering the Curiosity rover on cables until it reached the surface. Scientists monitoring the landing at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, including the President's Science Advisor, John Holdren, were elated. The crowd watching the NASA feed in Times Square cheered and began chanting, ""Science! Science!"" The Curiosity rover is roughly the size of a Mini Cooper. It cost a lot more and has better fuel economy, having coasted 352 million miles since launch, in 8.5 months. Scientists back on Earth used the long voyage to calibrate instruments and practice operating them. The mission has three goals: to assess the habitability of Mars, past and present; to study its geology and geochemistry; and to investigate planetary processes relevant to habitability, including the role of water. It is also useful preparation for future missions to Mars, perhaps including astronauts. Curiosity is not unlike a human: It has ""eyes"" (cameras) with which to see and analyze the landscape. There are eight ""hazcams"" front and back, to take stereo black-and-white pictures for depth perception, and four navigation cameras (""navcams"") at the top of an extendable mast. Besides the high mast, it has an ""arm"" that can go even higher and carries another camera. It has ""feet"" -- wheels, actually -- capable of rolling over obstacles up to 2½ feet high. Curiosity has ""ears"" to hear commands relayed from NASA's Deep Space Network via the Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance spacecraft orbiting Mars. Curiosity has many ""mouths"" to taste test rocks or dust it vacuums up -- really, to analyze them chemically. In fact, just like science labs on Earth, it has a number of complex instruments capable of testing the properties of solids, liquids and gases. Since cosmic radiation alters surface composition, Curiosity can drill into rock to extract pristine material from below. This is especially important for finding organic molecules that might be destroyed on the surface. Curiosity may be a robot, but it acts like a scientist: always skeptical, running experimental controls, double and triple checking every result. Unlike humans, thankfully, the robot won't be (easily) killed by radiation or toxic substances. How do we know what signs of life to look for? One example: By studying rocks on Earth, geologists know how different kinds of rocks formed and changed over time. In particular, biological materials alter igneous rocks in well-understood ways. Were we to see the same kinds of weathered rock on Mars, it's a good guess that life was once present on the Mars surface. Other instruments will test for atomic elements, organic materials, radiation and water. Over the next Martian year (687 Earth days), Curiosity will try to satisfy our curiosity about the world around us. Space is today's frontier. Renowned historian Frederick Jackson Turner posited that the American character was shaped by the frontier experience. With NASA's Mars Science Laboratory, we're all Lewises and Clarks.

"Viktor Frankl was a Jewish psychiatrist who spent three years during World War II living under unspeakable circumstances in several of the most notorious Nazi concentration camps. While imprisoned, Frankl realized he had one single freedom left: He had the power to determine his response to the horror unfolding around him. And so he chose to imagine. He imagined his wife and the prospect of seeing her again. He imagined himself teaching students after the war about the lessons he had learned. Frankl survived and went on to chronicle his experiences and the wisdom he had drawn from them. ""A human being is a deciding being,"" he wrote in his 1946 book, ""Man's Search for Meaning,"" which sold more than 10 million copies. ""Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom."" The idea of becoming conscious of the subjectivity of our perceptions is an admittedly abstract one -- the stuff of philosophy and science fiction. But human perceptions, and their ramifications, are very real and potentially life-changing. For example, research shows that people may hold an unconscious bias against creativity because it represents uncertainty unless they are able to perceive that uncertainty in a positive light. And consider the role perception plays in helping patients improve in ailments ranging from pain and depression to Parkinson's disease through a phenomenon known as the placebo effect. Though the placebo effect remains largely shrouded in mystery, researchers attribute some aspects of the placebo response to active mechanisms in the brain that can influence bodily processes such as the immune response and release of hormones. Studies also show that perceived risk can drive behavior change. The perception of the harmful effects of smoking, for example, can influence habit and addiction. So how might we harness the power of perception to live more conscious lives and, perhaps, to even recast the most dire situations in which we find ourselves? The fiction of reality . Perception begins when the human brain receives data from the body's five senses. The mind then processes and applies meaning to the sensory information. ""I want to start with a game,"" says neuroscientist and artist Beau Lotto at the outset of his TED talk on perception. ""To win this game, all you have to do is see the reality that's in front of you as it really is."" As it turns out, seeing that reality isn't as easy as it sounds, even when it comes to basic shapes and colors. Lotto uses a series of optical illusions involving light, color and space to show that even the most fundamental of our senses -- the way we perceive light and color -- can be subject to interpretation. The variable, says Lotto, is context. The exact same image can have an infinite number of sources in the real world. When it comes to perception -- seeing, feeling, hearing, sensing things -- there is no such thing as objectivity. Humans evolved to make sense of things. Every time a stimulus comes to us, our brain does the efficient thing: It responds based on past experience. In so doing, the brain continually redefines normality. It is being shaped, literally, as a consequence of trial and error. ""The brain did not evolve to see the world the way it really is -- we can't,"" Lotto says. ""We can't help but to see things according to history -- our own history and that of our ancestors -- because we are defined by ecology. Not by our biology, not by our DNA, but by our history of interactions."" Sensory information can mean just about anything, Lotto observes. It's what we do with that information that matters. When context distorts . Society gets inside of our heads and habits, says Ruha Benjamin, professor of sociology and African-American studies at Boston University. ""It forms everything from our taste in food, our sensibilities, what we think is good, bad or evil. None of these beliefs occur in isolation."" This profound social influence, known as ""habitus,"" is acquired through activities and experiences of everyday life, and is often taken for granted. The concept hails as far back as Aristotle. Quite often relying unconsciously on habitus for context serves us well. Until it doesn't. Take an infamous example of mistaken perception plucked from the news: So much of the encounter between Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman had to do with context and perceptions, Benjamin says. ""Think about the different ways in which a majority of Americans see the agency of black men,"" she says. ""In certain contexts, like on a court during March Madness, we are perfectly comfortable celebrating these bodies. But take those same bodies and place them in a different context -- walking down the street in a predominantly white neighborhood -- and quickly that perception of black masculinity at the core of our culture changes context. And in this new context, being a black male may suddenly become a life and death issue."" And so we sometimes find ourselves at a crossroads, in a place of uncertainty, faced with perceptions borne of falsehood, misunderstanding, bias or disunity -- perceptions that do not serve us. Echoing Frankl, Lotto says of those types of perceptions: ""We are responding and not choosing."" The beginning of awareness . According to Lotto, the creation of all new perceptions begins in the same way, with a single question: ""Why?"" ""Why"" is, in that sense, the most dangerous word in history, Lotto observes. Because as soon as you ask that question, you open up the possibility of change. So asking ""why"" may be the hardest thing for people to do. Education must be about creating new perceptions, Lotto says. Traditionally education has been about efficiency -- it wants to know what happens at the end. There is a right answer. But people really need to learn to move between the ""why"" and the ""how."" Innovation and change are, at their very essence, a ""why"" proposition, says Jennifer Mueller, a psychologist and Wharton management professor who studies creativity. The ""how"" comes later. It is in this way that perception often becomes the gateway to innovation and change. ""People are so averse to uncertainty that they can't see creativity. They are blind to it,"" Mueller notes. But by becoming aware of our mind-sets and perceptions, we can step in the direction of breakthroughs. The power to choose a response . There are practical ways to start on the path to growth and innovation. You must at the outset be certain that you want change, Mueller says. ""Be clear strategically whether you really are looking for something groundbreaking. Define what that means. Sometimes people call something innovation, but it really isn't."" Lotto says that the underlying aim of his research is to help people transform by enabling them to understand and become part of learning about their own perceptions. ""I hope people will walk away from my experiments, not with an understanding of color, but an understanding of themselves, or at least a question of themselves."" The first step, he says, is through awareness. ""You must see yourself see. It's about observation and curiosity, having a sense of wonder, becoming aware of the connection between the past and the present. Becoming an observer of yourself enables you to do amazing things."" Benjamin agrees. ""Become aware of how your habitat forms your habits,"" she says. What we are fighting for, Benjamin says, is our imagination -- the right to imagine a life and relationships and a social world that are happier, less anxious, more harmonious and more just. ""We are not being diligent enough or deliberate enough about cultivating our imagination. We have to fight for our ability to imagine the world we want. Because one form of oppression is telling people that they're not allowed to imagine something better and happier."" ""Either there are no illusions or everything is an illusion,"" said Lotto at the conclusion of his remarks at the recent Being Human 2012 conference. ""And given that we are pretty much all delusional, you might as well choose your delusion.""","We have the power to choose our responses, Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl said .
The power of our perceptions can be seen with the placebo effect during clinical trials .

"(CNN) -- They may be famous, but even the world's biggest names go weak at the knees for their favorite football team. Football Fanzone talks to tennis legend Boris Becker about his true number one passion: German giants Bayern Munich. Why do you support Bayern Munich? I am a big fan of Bayern and have been for years. I've actually been on the advisory board for ten years. Every German kid, before they walk and before they can talk, they love their football. It is similar story for me. Before I was a tennis player I was a football player [and supporter]. So you can say that your first love was football? Football is as much of a love as tennis. Of all the players who have played for Bayern down the years, which have stood out the most? We'll have to start with ""The Kaiser"", Franz Beckenbauer. He was obviously the captain of the team, and a World Cup winner, but he also won lots of national and international awards. So he was the standout. But you also had Gerd Muller, Sepp Maier, many superstars. Until now it was the most prominent club in the country. Since the 1970s it was the most successful, the richest and had the biggest fan base. Munich is the club you want to root for. Bayern had a tricky season last season, losing out to Wolfsburg for the title. Are you optimistic for this season? True, Wolfsburg had an incredible run, but we call this a bad season because we finished second. You can imagine the standards here. This year it is not much easier with a new coach Louis Van Gaal. We've not had the greatest of starts but we have got a new Dutch player, [former Chelsea and Real Madrid winger Arjen] Robben, who I think is going to make all the difference in the world. Can Bayern recover from this season's slow start under Van Gaal? If you were manager of Bayern at the moment would you change anything? I would be a little worried about the defence. We let, in my opinion, one of the best defensive players we have ever had go, [Brazilian international] Lucio, who went to Inter Milan. I don't know why or what happened but I don't think we are as strong defensively as we are offensively. We have to score at least three goals to win now! You travel around the world a lot and have a lot of commitments due to your tennis. How do you keep up with Bayern and how does your fan nature come out in your life? We are living in the world of technology, the internet and the media. So it's particularly easy to keep up with the latest gossip and the results. But I am still quite often in Munich and I watch the club and talk to the players. Do you have a favorite piece of memorabilia? I have the shirt and go as often as I can. I was part of their heart breaking loss against Manchester united in Barcelona in the Champions League [final]. I was in the stadium and after I was with the players crying together. Then I was in Milan two years later and we won in the penalty shoot out against Valencia and I was celebrating with them afterwards. Those were my two most memorable moments.","Becker has been a lifelong fan of Bayern Munich .

"Several detainees in Libya have died after being tortured in recent weeks, the human rights group Amnesty International said Thursday. The humanitarian aid group Doctors Without Borders said it was halting its work in detention centers in Misrata because detainees are ""tortured and denied urgent medical care."" The agency, known by its French acronym MSF, said it has treated 115 people with torture-related wounds from interrogation sessions. Christopher Stokes, general director of MSF, told CNN that two detainees died -- one in October and another in November -- within 30 minutes of being interrogated. Autopsies were not carried out, so the cause of death is unknown, he said. In a statement, Amnesty described ""widespread torture and ill-treatment of suspected pro-Gadhafi fighters and loyalists,"" a reference to those who fought for the regime of leader Moammar Gadhafi until his ouster and death. ""Amnesty International delegates in Libya have met detainees being held in and around Tripoli, Misrata and Gharyan, who showed visible marks indicating torture inflicted in recent days and weeks. Their injuries included open wounds on the head, limbs, back and other parts of the body. ""The torture is being carried out by officially recognized military and security entities as well by a multitude of armed militias operating outside any legal framework,"" Amnesty said in a statement. Libyan officials could not be immediately reached for comment. Interim Prime Minister Abderrahim el-Keib, in a televised addressed Wednesday evening about the state of affairs in Libya, said a plan was in progress to take over prisons partially. Libya's ambassador to the United Nations, Mohammed Shalgham, told the United Nations on Wednesday that Libya does not approve of any abuse of detainees and was working to stop any such practices. Amnesty published what it said were quotes from tortured detainees in Misrata. ""Five men in plain clothes took turns beating and whipping me. ... They suspended me from the top of the door by my wrists for about an hour and kept beating me. They also kicked me,"" one said, according to the human rights group. ""Yesterday they beat me with electric cable while my hands were cuffed behind my back and my feet were bound together. They threatened to send me back to the militia who captured me, who would kill me,"" said another, according to Amnesty. MSF said some of the patients its personnel have treated were tortured again after being returned to detention centers. ""Some officials have sought to exploit and obstruct MSF's medical work,"" said Stokes, the general director. ""Patients were brought to us for medical care between interrogation sessions, so that they would be fit for further interrogation. This is unacceptable. Our role is to provide medical care to war casualties and sick detainees, not to repeatedly treat the same patients between torture sessions."" MSF officials told CNN the injuries included cigarette burns, fractures, and electroshocks, which are ""definitely"" due to torture. There were also clear signs of beatings, Stokes said. The detainees with torture wounds includes former fighters in the conflict, ""but also people who have been accused of theft,"" Stokes said. MSF is continuing its work providing mental health services in Misrata schools and health centers, he said. Libya faces challenges in building a new nation . Navi Pillay, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, voiced similar concerns about torture in Libya, sparking the response from Shalgham, Libya's U.N. envoy. Pillay said the International Committee of the Red Cross had visited more than 8,500 detainees in about 60 places in Libya between March and December. The majority of the detainees are accused of being Gadhafi loyalists, Pillay said Wednesday. She said the issue is part of the difficulties Libya is having in law enforcement and security as the country transitions from Gadhafi's rule. ""The lack of oversight by the central authorities creates an environment conducive to torture and ill-treatment,"" Pillay said.","Doctors Without Borders official says two detainees died in custody late last year .

"(CNN)A vein on an Oklahoma inmate ""exploded"" in the middle of his execution Tuesday, prompting authorities to abruptly halt the process and call off another execution later in the day as they try to figure out what went wrong. The inmate, Clayton Lockett, died 43 minutes after the first injection was administered -- according to reporter Courtney Francisco of CNN affiliate KFOR who witnessed the ordeal -- of an apparent heart attack, Oklahoma Department of Corrections Director Robert Patton said. That first drug, midazolam, is supposed to render a person unconscious. Seven minutes later, Lockett was still conscious. About 16 minutes in, after his mouth and then his head moved, he seemingly tried to get up and tried to talk, saying ""man"" aloud, according to the KFOR account. Other reporters -- including Cary Aspinwall of the Tulsa World newspaper -- similarly claimed that Lockett was ""still alive,"" having lifted his head while prison officials lowered the blinds at that time so that onlookers couldn't see what was going on. Dean Sanderford, Lockett's attorney, said that he saw his client's body start ""to twitch (and) he mumbled something."" Then ""the convulsing got worse, it looked like his whole upper body was trying to lift off the gurney."" Yet the office of Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin issued a statement indicating ""execution officials said Lockett remained unconscious after the lethal injection drugs were administered."" After the ordeal, Patton told reporters that Lockett, a convicted murderer, had been sedated and then was given the second and third drugs in protocol. ""There was some concern at that time that the drugs were not having the effect, so the doctor observed the line and determined that the line had blown,"" he said, before elaborating that Lockett's vein had ""exploded."" ""I notified the attorney general's office, the governor's office of my intent to stop the execution and requested a stay for 14 days for the second execution scheduled this afternoon,"" said Patton, referring to the execution of Charles Warner. Dianne Clay, a spokeswoman for the state attorney general's office, said Tuesday night that her office was ""gathering information on what happened in order to evaluate."" The state's governor ordered an investigation and issued an executive order granting a 2-week delay in executions. ""I have asked the Department of Corrections to conduct a full review of Oklahoma's execution procedures to determine what happened and why during this evening's execution of Clayton Derrell Lockett,"" Fallin said in a statement. The constitutionality of lethal injection drugs and drug cocktails has made headlines since last year, when European manufacturers -- including Denmark-based Lundbeck, which manufactures pentobarbital -- banned U.S. prisons from using their drugs in executions. Thirty-two states were left to find new drug protocols. Opinion: End secrecy in lethal injections . According to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections, its protocol includes midazolam, which causes unconsciousness, vecuronium bromide, which stops respiration, and potassium chloride, which is meant to stop the heart. Lockett was convicted in 2000 of a bevy of crimes, including first-degree murder, first-degree rape, kidnapping and robbery in a 1999 home invasion and crime spree that left Stephanie Nieman dead and two people injured. His final moments gave new life, at least temporarily, to Charles Warner. Warner was convicted in 2003 for the first-degree rape and murder six years earlier of his then-girlfriend's 11-month-old daughter, Adrianna Waller. The state decided to put off his execution set for Tuesday. But it has given no indication this delay will be indefinite despite calls from the likes of Adam Leathers, co-chair of the Oklahoma Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, who accused the state of having ""tortured a human being in an unconstitutional experimental act of evil."" ""Tonight, our state government has acted in sin and violated God's law,"" Leathers said. ""We will pray for their souls."" Notably, Lockett and Warner -- who were both held at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester -- had been at the center of a court fight over the drugs used in their execution. They'd initially challenged the state Department of Corrections' unwillingness to divulge which drugs would be used, only for the department to budge and disclosed the substances. But Lockett and Warner didn't stop there, taking issue with the state's so-called secrecy provision forbidding it from disclosing the identities of anyone involved in the execution process or suppliers of any drugs or medical equipment. Oklahoma's high court initially issued stays on their executions, only to lift those stays last week in ruling the two men had no right to know the source of the drugs intended to kill them. Warner's attorney, Madeline Cohen, said that further legal action can be expected given how ""something went horribly awry"" Tuesday. ""Oklahoma cannot carry out further executions until there's transparency in this process,"" Cohen said. ""...I think they should all be looking at themselves hard. Oklahoma needs to take a step back."" Death penalty Fast Facts . Death penalty in the United States gradually declining . CNN's Eliott C.

"""Dangerous,"" ""Reckless"" -- ""Innocent people who might get injured or killed."" That's how Supreme Court justices characterized the consequences of a motorist fleeing police in a high-speed chase that ended violently. Every justice who spoke at a tense oral argument on Tuesday seemed inclined to support three Arkansas police officers who opened fire on a runaway motorist, killing the driver and his passenger. The case involves an appeal that again tests the limits of split-second law enforcement discretion for using deadly force. The incident in question began in July 2004, when police in West Memphis, Arkansas, questioned  Donald Rickard at a gas station about a broken light on his white Honda. He refused to step out the car and then took off. With his girlfriend, Kelly Allen, in the passenger seat, Rickard crossed the Mississippi River into Tennessee along Interstate 40. Mounted cameras from three police vehicles, led by Officer Vance Plumhoff, show Rickard weaving in and out of traffic, then ramming a police car head-on. The Honda is later surrounded and as the suspect tries to back up, he sideswipes another cop car, and almost strikes one of the officers. The video then captures police firing 15 point-blank shots into the vehicle, as it drives away. The car then goes airborne and slams into a house in Memphis. Rickard and Allen, both 44, were killed. Rickard's family sued police, who argue they're immune from such legal action. Courts struggle with interpretation . The Supreme Court has previously said law enforcement and government officials are generally shielded from ""liability for civil damages"" unless their conduct is egregious. But state and federal courts have struggled with a broad application for high-speed pursuits, especially of those not implicated in a criminal offense. At arguments, Justice Antonin Scalia, constantly pushed the lawyer for Rickard's' family to demonstrate whether the law was clearly established to show the officers' actions were unreasonable. ""We are still left with a very dangerous man careening down the road, who is surrounded by police cars and still tries to get away to continue his careening,"" said Scalia. It was ""your client who caused the whole thing, who caused the shooting in the last analysis."" During the high court's public look at the case, it was clear the police version of the facts held sway. The car ""is eventually surrounded by officers with guns pointed at the driver demanding that he get out, that he put his hands up, and stop driving. They are pounding on the windows of the car. And the driver then begins to drive away,"" said Justice Samuel Alito. ""What do reasonable officers do? Maybe what they should do is to continue the chase indefinitely."" Rickard ""has already gone 100 miles an hour when the car moved away, even though that part of the street was deserted,"" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor. ""Why would a reasonable officer not be suspicious that more reckless driving is going to occur?"" Standard of misconduct . The family's attorney, Gary Smith, suggested Rickard may not have been trying to continue the chase when eventually surrounded by police. ""You can't tell because he is bumper to bumper with the (Officer John) Gardner's car,"" said Smith. ""It is true that the wheels spin forward."" ""What do you mean? He is going to the police station?"" asked Justice Anthony Kennedy skeptically. Justice Stephen Breyer tried to give Smith rhetorical room to make his point but said the ""clearly established"" standard of misconduct was not met. ""When I saw the film, I saw your point. You have a point. But what I can't quite see is how it was a clearly established"" violation, he said. ""So I'm left in this uncertainty, which unfortunately for you means it wasn't clearly established."" Justice Elena Kagan wondered whether the fact 15 shots were fired, and that there was a passenger involved should be taken into account in the fact-specific inquiry. Chief Justice John Roberts pursued a similar line of questioning: ""Is there any situation in which the application of lethal force during a high-speed case in your view would not be justified?"" An O.J. reference . The attorney for the officers reluctantly cited the low-speed pursuit of former football star O.J. Simpson, suspected of murdering his wife and her friend in 1994. ""I hate to use television as an example, but perhaps the way the white Ford Bronco fled in the early '90s that everybody saw on TV,"" said Michael Mosley. ""That seemed to be relatively non-dangerous or at least not a danger of serious physical injury."" The Obama administration is supporting the officers in the Memphis case. The high court has been down this legal road before, ruling in 2007 a Georgia police officer used ""reasonable force"" when ramming a young speeding motorist off the road, leaving him a paraplegic. That 8-1 opinion gave law enforcement significant protection from similar lawsuits, even when no other serious felonies surrounding the chase may have been committed. that was the first time the high court heard a case involving deadly force in police chases, and lower federal appeals courts have been split on the issue. Under generally applied Supreme Court precedents, an officer must show a suspect poses a ""significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others"" before using deadly force. But some judges have since concluded that officers can be stripped of qualified immunity from lawsuits, citing the incident-specific, subjective circumstances unique to each pursuit. Impact on police . Law enforcement groups worry a ruling against Plumhoff would hamstring every police official, who would often have to make split-second decisions about whether to wait until someone gets hurt -- including innocent victims or the officer himself -- before they could stop escaping motorists. Many police departments have specific policies about when to chase and when to hold back, but there are no national statistics on how jurisdictions handle such situations. A 2004 study by the University of Washington showed 260 to 325 people were killed in high-speed crashes involving police, from 1994 to 2002. While Rickard's family may not prevail, the larger question was whether the high court will now address the constitutional concerns, and give law enforcement around the country clearer guidelines on the proper line for use of deadly force. A ruling is expected within three months. The case is Plumhoff v. Rickard (12-1117).","Case involves motorist who led police on chase following minor traffic stop .

"As adults we're told time and again to keep a close eye on young children around water. Most kids who drown are under the age of 4 -- toddlers who accidentally fall into water too deep. They can drown in minutes in less than 2 inches of water. But the recent death of a 13-year-old at a pool in Florida has experts concerned about water safety for pre-teens and adolescents. Anthony Johnson had been playing in a pool at Disney's Pop Century Resort on Sunday. Relatives told CNN affiliate WFTV that Anthony was jumping in and out with friends when they noticed him missing, and pulled him out of the water within minutes. The boy died Tuesday morning, according to the Orange County Sheriff's Office. Police are still investigating his death. Ten people die every day from unintentional drowning in the United States, making it the fifth-leading cause of unintentional injury death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 20% are under the age of 14. Nearly 80% are male. ""The first thing to remember is that drowning doesn't just happen,"" says Alison Osinski, water safety expert and president of Aquatic Consulting Services. ""Something always precipitates drowning."" Only about 35% of Americans know how to swim, and only 2% to 7% swim well, Osinski says. Teens are particularly susceptible to peer pressure and often go past their limits. Exhaustion or disorientation under water could cause a weak swimmer to panic. In this case, the swimmer would go through the stages of what lifeguards call an ""active drowning,"" Osinski says. The word ""active"" may be misleading, as active drowning is nothing like what you usually see on TV. 15 things your lifeguard won't tell you . In an active drowning, a swimmer is at or below eye level at the surface of the water for about 10 to 20 seconds. The head is tilted back to get air. The eyes are either wide open or tightly shut. The mouth is often in an ""O"" shape from shock. ""You're not drowning if you can call for help,"" Osinski says. After about 20 seconds, the swimmer will start to sink and will hold his breath underwater for anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds. If rescued during this time, the swimmer usually will be fine. After 90 seconds, Osinski says, a swimmer will black out. At this point, things get dicey. If a swimmer is resuscitated after the four-minute mark, there's a high risk of brain damage. The pool safety hazard you don't know about . Drowning also can be caused by trauma or a medical condition, Osinski says. Diving into shallow water could result in paralysis from a spinal injury. Experts also look for unknown heart issues in sudden drowning cases. People with epilepsy or seizure disorders are also at high-risk. Osinski says one of the most subtle forms of drowning is called ""shallow water blackout."" Typically, a person holding his breath will be triggered to breathe when his CO2 levels get high. But if a swimmer is holding his breath for a long time while exhaling underwater, or is going underwater repeatedly, his CO2 levels are lowered. When that happens, the brain's built-in alarm to breathe doesn't go off, despite a lack of oxygen. ""You can't tell when they go unconscious, until it's too late,"" Osinski says. Osinski has videos of teens drowning that were recorded on their friends' phones. The most common phrase she hears from witnesses is: ""I thought they were just fooling around."" How safe is your indoor swimming pool? Connie Harvey, aquatics manager for the American Red Cross, says people of all ages need to understand the risks associated with water. ""People need to know how to swim well, they need to know how to behave safely, and make good choices for where they swim."" More than half of drowning deaths in people older than 15 occur outside of pools, according to the CDC. And alcohol is involved in 70% of cases. Parents should set expectations for teens around water ahead of time, Harvey says. No one should be allowed to swim alone, even if they are a strong swimmer. Following the rules of a pool is also key: no running, no horseplay, no diving into shallow water. And the Red Cross recommends against any type of breath-holding competition. Teens should know their own limits, Harvey says, and not follow stronger swimmers without help. ""We talk about the dangerous TOOs -- too far, too long,"" she says. If teens are swimming in a natural body of water like a lake or river, they should use the rule ""feet first, first time"" to prevent spinal injuries. And when the sun stops shining, swimmers should stop swimming. Harvey's final rule is the most important: learn how to swim. The Red Cross and many local swim organizations offer lessons for children as young as 6 months old and their parents. How can I keep my toddler safe in the pool? People should feel confident in whatever water environment they're in, Harvey says, whether it's a wave pool at a water park or a river with a strong current. No one should swim alone and, if possible, always swim under the watchful eye of a certified lifeguard. Last but not least, if you do get yourself or a friend in trouble, know how to get help. Learn CPR and get training on an automated external defibrillator, or AED. Be aware of reach poles or buoys that can be thrown to help a drowning swimmer, Harvey says, and call 911 at the first sign of an emergency.","Recent teen death in Florida has experts concerned about water safety .

"Turkish football club Fenerbahce have been excluded from European competitions for two years after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) upheld a ban issued by UEFA. Fenerbahce were handed the sanction by European football's governing body for fixing matches to help the team win the 2011 Turkish Super Lig title. The Istanbul team had been due to enter the second-tier Europa League after losing to English team Arsenal in a two-legged Champions League playoff. Fenerbahce were not immediately available for comment. The CAS also upheld a one-year ban meted out to Ukrainian team Metalist Kharkiv, also for match-fixing. Metalist were replaced by PAOK Thessaloniki in the Champions League qualification competition following the original verdict earlier this month. PAOK were subsequently eliminated by German club Schalke. UEFA will meet on Thursday to discuss who will take Fenerbahce's place in the Europa League. ""UEFA welcomes today's decisions of the CAS rejecting the appeals made by Fenerbahce SK and FC Metalist Kharkiv against the UEFA Appeals Body decisions of 15 July 2013 and 14 August 2013 respectively,"" read a UEFA statement.

"Photos that allegedly show the Syrian regime committing mass torture are ""fake,"" Syria's Justice Ministry said Wednesday. In a statement on the state news agency SANA, the Justice Ministry categorically denied allegations published in a new report accusing the regime of torturing and killing thousands of detainees in government custody. The statement branded the report ""politicized and lacking in objectivity and professionalism"" and said some of the photos are of ""foreign terrorists."" It then said any expert ""could easily find out that these pictures are fake and that they have no relation to prisoners or detainees in Syrian prisons."" The report, first released by CNN on Monday, was authored by a team of international legal and forensic experts based on thousands of photographs provided by a Syrian defector. He claimed to have worked as a photographer at a military hospital that received dead bodies from detention centers. The Justice Ministry's response is the first official Syrian government reaction to the report, which emerged on the eve of an international peace talks in Switzerland. The images purportedly show ""systematic torture and killing"" of detainees by the al-Assad regime. Could photos be a game changer? That assertion is being made by a team of internationally recognized war crimes prosecutors and forensic experts, who analyzed thousands of digital photos taken and provided by a Syrian defector codenamed ""Caesar,"" who, along with his family, is now living outside Syria in an undisclosed location. Lifeless bodies, signs of starvation . In the photos, lifeless bodies show signs of starvation, brutal beatings, strangulation and other forms of torture and killing, according to the report. The experts' report was partly sponsored by the government of Qatar, which funded the British law firm Carter-Ruck to write it. Qatar and Saudi Arabia provide most of the outside support for Syria's rebel forces. The Syrian Justice Ministry accused Carter-Ruck of a lack of professionalism and said it was ""known to have direct ties with countries that are hostile to the Syrian Arab Republic since the start of the crisis."" Aside from the photos of ""foreign terrorists,"" other individuals shown are ""civilians and military personnel who were killed as a result of torture by armed terrorist groups because they were accused of being pro-state,"" it claims. The ministry questions the credibility of the photographer, saying he was ""a fugitive who fled Syria and who was already facing legal action,"" and asks how he would have got the necessary documents to leave the country. It also suggests that the timing of the publication of the photographs reveals their ""true purpose"" -- that of undermining the peace talks starting in Montreux Wednesday and moving to Geneva at the end of the week. The report ""aims to undermine the efforts to bring peace in Syria and put an end to the international sponsored terrorism in the country,"" the statement said.","Syrian Justice Ministry says photos are ""fake"" and have no relation to government detainees .

"(CNN) -- Khaldoon Khalifa Al Mubarak is CEO of Mubadala Development Company. In this role, he oversees the delivery of an aggressive investment strategy, generating significant financial returns and driving sustainable economic development in the United Arab Emirates. Mubarak at the signing of the February deal with F1 that will see Abu Dhabi host a Formula One race in 2009 . Khaldoon is also chairman of the Executive Affairs Authority of the Government of Abu Dhabi. This specialized government agency is mandated to provide strategic policy advice to the chairman of Abu Dhabi's Executive Council, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, The Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi. In addition, Mubarak is a board member of First Gulf Bank and also holds positions on the boards of ALDAR Properties, Dolphin Energy Limited and the philanthropic Emirates Foundation. He is chairman of The Imperial College London Diabetes Center, vice chairman of the supervisory board of LeasePlan Corporation and vice chairman of Piaggio Aero, the leading Italian Aerospace company. All of these organizations are wholly or partly owned by Mubadala Development Company. CNN's John Defterios met Mubarak in Abu Dhabi and began by asking him about Mubadala's recent purchase of a 7.5 percent stake in the U.S. investment firm, Carlyle Group for $1.35 billion. Defterios: In the past we've talked about a return or a double-bottom line for Mubadala when you approach investments. One is a financial return, the other is a strategic return. How does Carlyle fit into a double bottom-line for Mubadala? Mubarak: If you look at the areas Carlyle has focused on - aerospace, energy, power, infrastructure, transportation, healthcare - these are all areas you find Mubadala very aggressively acting in. And the synergies that we see, the potential partnerships that can be created through this investment are endless. So it's a very good fit for us, it's a very good deal for Mubadala and I think it's the right step. Defterios: As you know, a Chinese firm took a non-voting stake in the Blackstone Group before its IPO, $3 Billion but has seen that investment tumble. What makes you confident that this will play out differently for Mubadala? Mubarak: We've met with all the executives at Carlyle, we've looked at their track record. Their track record speaks for itself. We're confident in all the due diligence work we've done, and I think this investment will pay off handsomely for us in the years to come. Defterios: It's interesting, you were in Washington closing this deal, three weeks ago I see you in South East Asia on a real estate development and in between you're in Manza with your F1 obligations in Italy. I take it that speed is of the essence these days. You're moving at such a rapid speed in all directions at this stage. Mubarak: I'm getting used to sleeping on planes, let me put it that way. Defterios: That's an understatement. Seriously, the speed is quite impressive. Mubarak: It's been a tremendous roller coaster ride over the last couple of years, and the growth in Abu Dhabi, the growth in the region and the growth that Mubadala has gone through is tremendous. It requires people like me, executives in this company and executives across the board to be running around and making sure we get the right deals and the right partnerships and making sure we have a sustainable growth strategy. Defterios: You have a wide-ranging portfolio. If you look at it, it doesn't seem to blend or come together. Dolphin energy, a huge natural gas project in this region, majority holder. Five percent stake in Ferrari. I mean how do we know that's not just a vanity investment for Ferrari? How does that fit in to your long term strategy? Mubarak: Well Ferrari has been a very exciting and interesting investment for us. Again, right off the bat, it's a financial investment, it makes a lot of sense, it provides the right returns for us. But beyond that, we created a strategic alliance with Ferrari. Two years later, we have a Grand Prix in Abu Dhabi. That couldn't have happened without that entry point, in Ferrari. Dolphin is another great story for us because this was a project that seven years ago, was a dream. I remember talking to people about building a pipeline between Qatar and the UAE to transport gas, and people frankly looked at me and said, ""you're nuts, that's not gonna happen."" Well here we are, it's 2007, gas is flowing from Qatar to the UAE and it's done. Defterios: How do you avoid the eventual backlash here that seems to be brooding or percolating at this stage? Are there merits to the argument that this is just oil-wealth being redeployed and not a level playing field? Mubarak: Mubadala now is focusing on creating a good corporate institution. It's a totally different ball game than maybe 10 years ago or maybe 15 years ago, with the type of corporations and institutions that are now coming up in the region, and the approach they are taking in the investment strategies that they are pursuing. Defterios: We are sitting in an extremely grand Emirates Palace Hotel, a $3 billion structure. You have an urban plan that goes out to 2030. What's this going to tell us about Abu Dhabi in this time frame? We don't know much about this Emirate in the last 10 years. Mubarak: Abu Dhabi has typically been very conservative in its approach. We've always taken a lot of care towards planning, towards strategic thinking, in any sector we are involved in. It's a 23-year plan that looks at the growth of the city and makes sure that the growth of the city is in line with the aspirations of the government, with the aspirations of the people and in line with the type of developments that are being put forward from the real estate private sector and the industrial sector that is now growing at a pace that you don't see in many other places.

"(CNN)In a new publication, ISIS justifies its kidnapping of women as sex slaves citing Islamic theology, an interpretation that is rejected by the Muslim world at large as a perversion of Islam. ""One should remember that enslaving the families of the kuffar -- the infidels -- and taking their women as concubines is a firmly established aspect of the Shariah, or Islamic law,"" the group says in an online magazine published Sunday. The title of the article sums up the ISIS point of view: ""The revival (of) slavery before the Hour,"" referring to Judgment Day. The fourth edition of the group's English-language digital magazine called ""Dabiq"" said that female members of the Yazidi sect, an ethnically Kurdish minority living mostly in Iraq, may legitimately be captured and forcibly made concubines or sexual slaves. The rationalization for a return to slavery -- repudiated around the world -- coincided with the release of a Human Rights Watch report on crimes committed by ISIS against the Yazidis in Iraq based on interviews with 76 displaced people in Dohuk. ""The Islamic State's litany of horrific crimes against the Yazidis in Iraq only keeps growing,"" said Fred Abrahams, special adviser at Human Rights Watch. ""We heard shocking stories of forced religious conversions, forced marriage, and even sexual assault and slavery -- and some of the victims were children."" A 17-year-old kidnapped girl named Adlee recounts how a large bearded man forced her into a home in Falluja, where she was beaten and endured violent sexual advances before escaping two days later, the Human Rights Watch report reads. ISIS forced tens of thousands of Yazidis to flee their homes in August when the extremists stormed many of the community's towns and cities in Iraqi Kurdistan. Displaced families and monitoring groups reported jihadists kidnapped hundreds of Yazidi women and girls, and many were sold or given away to militants as ""spoils of war."" The terror group's 56-page propaganda publication also boasts of a ""massacre against (Kurdish) PKK soldiers"" alongside graphic images of slain men dressed in fatigues. On the next page, ISIS glorifies  its ""Services for Muslims"" with photographs of a care home for the elderly and a cancer treatment center for children. The issue, titled ""The Failed Crusade,"" includes an alleged copy of slain American journalist Steven Sotloff's last letter to his mother and says the victim's Jewish identity warranted his beheading by ISIS. Another ISIS captive, British journalist John Cantlie, allegedly pens the last section of the magazine, saying he expects to be killed soon, and ""unless something changes very quickly and very radically, I await my turn.""","In an online magazine, the terror group says it is legitimate under Islamic law .

"(CNN)  -- In death as in life, Michael Jackson continues to light up the Internet. Millions worldwide watched online coverage of Michael Jackson's funeral service in Los Angeles. Millions of people around the world watched coverage of Jackson's memorial service on the Web, although the event appeared to fall well short of online viewership records. Global Web traffic was at least 19 percent above normal, and as high as 33 percent above normal, during most of the star-studded memorial at the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles, California, according to Akamai Technologies, a Massachusetts-based firm that monitors Internet traffic. CNN.com reported 9.7 million live video streams Tuesday between 12 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET -- which included the entire memorial service -- according to CNN spokeswoman Jennifer Martin. The news site's all-time viewership record for a full day, almost 27 million video streams, was set on President Obama's inauguration day in January. During that period Tuesday, CNN.com also attracted 81 million page views, 11.8 unique visitors and a peak of 781,000 concurrent live video streams, according to internal data. Jackson's startling June 25 death nearly brought the Web to a standstill, with several sites buckling under the sheer weight of traffic. The Internet appeared to fare better during Tuesday's memorial service, however. ""So far we are seeing some slowdowns ... [but] overall the Internet is performing OK,"" said Dan Berkowitz, spokesman for Keynote Systems, a mobile and Internet monitoring firm based in San Mateo, California, midway through the Staples Center event. Keynote monitors the 40 most popular news Web sites from major cities around the United States. CNN.com partnered with Facebook, the social-networking site, to let friends and family share commentary while watching Jackson's memorial service live online. As of 1:30 p.m. ET, shortly before the memorial service began, the partnership was yielding about 6,000 status updates per minute, said a Facebook spokeswoman. CNN.com and Facebook entered into a similar collaboration during Obama's inauguration, although Facebook saw twice as many status updates during that event. With many North Americans at work during Jackson's memorial service, online traffic had been expected to reach near-record levels. ""This event will almost certainly shatter records for the biggest single live stream ever, and could be one of the biggest worldwide media events in history,"" wrote blogger Ben Parr on Mashable, the social media news site. Other Web sites, including CBSNews.com, ABCNews.com, FoxNews.com and Hulu.com, also hosted live streaming coverage of the service. The 10 most popular topics on Twitter Tuesday afternoon were all connected to Jackson's memorial. Google Trends rated the Jackson memorial's online popularity as ""volcanic,"" while on Web-traffic monitoring site Alexa, most of its hottest stories Tuesday were Jackson-related. But early numbers suggested that Internet traffic Tuesday may have lagged behind other recent news events. Akamai recorded a peak of 3.9 million global Internet visitors per minute shortly after noon ET -- less than half the number of users who went online the evening of November 4, 2008, to follow presidential election returns. ""It may be impossible to say for sure how many people watched once all is said and done, because there's still no comprehensive way to measure Web viewing,"" said Toni Fitzgerald, managing editor of Media Life, in an e-mail interview with CNN. Long before the memorial service began about 1:40 p.m. ET, many Web sites braced themselves for an onslaught of traffic. During the sign-up period for the memorial ticket lottery, the Staples Center Web site took down all non-essential materials to ensure that it coped. Jackson family spokesman Ken Sunshine said the computer servers hosting the registration site counted 500 million ""hits"" -- 120,000 a second -- in the first 90 minutes on Friday. About 17,500 fans were randomly selected to watch the memorial live at the Staples Center -- only a small fraction of the 1.6 million fans who applied for tickets.

"(CNN) -- Convicted Beltway sniper John Allen Muhammad is scheduled to be executed by lethal injection November 10, a Virginia corrections official said Tuesday. ""Inmate John Muhammad was offered a choice in method of execution, and he declined,"" Larry Traylor said. ""Under the code, if the inmate declines to choose, it defaults to lethal injection."" Muhammad was convicted of killing Dean Harold Meyers, one of several victims in a series of sniper-style shootings that terrorized the Washington area in October 2002. During a three-week period, Muhammad and his young protege, Lee Boyd Malvo, shot 13 people, killing 10 of them, police said. The two also are suspected in other shootings, including in Tacoma, Washington; Montgomery, Alabama; and elsewhere in the Washington metro area. Attorneys for Muhammad argued last week that he should be given clemency on the grounds that he has a severe mental illness that worsened while he served in the Persian Gulf War. Attorney Jonathan Sheldon said he and other attorneys presented Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine's representatives with audio interviews with attorneys, mental health experts and witnesses rather than a written document. They said they plan to file an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court on November 3. Kaine's office said that any information on the clemency request would come in the form of a news release at a later date. CNN's Mike M. Ahlers contributed to this report.","Attorneys for John Allen Muhammad say he has severe mental illness .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Minutes after he reported hitting birds and losing power in both engines, the pilot of US Airways Flight 1549 calmly told an air traffic controller the plane would ditch into the Hudson River. Surveillance video shows passengers of US Airways Flight 1549 hurrying onto the plane's wings. ""We can't do it,"" pilot Chesley B. ""Sully"" Sullenberger said at 3:29 p.m. on January 15, in response to efforts to land the plane at New Jersey's Teterboro airport, according to a recording released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration. ""We're gonna be in the Hudson,"" Sullenberger said, about three and a half minutes after the Airbus A320 took off from New York's LaGuardia Airport. ""I'm sorry, say again,"" said the controller, from New York Tracon, a radar facility on Long Island that handles flights after they depart from LaGuardia or Teterboro airports..  Listen to the pilot talk to the controllers » . There is no response. The plane, headed from LaGuardia to Charlotte, North Carolina, ditched into the frigid Hudson River. All 155 passengers and crew members on board survived the incident. About two minutes before Sullenberger said the plane would end up in the river, he reported hitting birds and losing power in both engines. ""Hit birds. We lost thrust in both engines. We're turning back towards LaGuardia,"" Sullenberger said at 3:27 p.m., about a minute and a half after the flight took off. A controller at New York Tracon responded to the pilot, saying ""OK, yeah, you need to return to LaGuardia."" The controller then alerted LaGuardia's air traffic control tower: ""Tower, stop your departures, we got an emergency returning."" Read transcript of pilot's communication with controllers . Minutes later, Sullenberger said the plane might not make it back to LaGuardia. ""We're unable. We may end up in the Hudson,"" he said. The Tracon controller then asked the pilot if he wants to go to Teterboro airport in New Jersey. The pilot said yes, and the controller alerted air traffic control there. At 3:29 p.m., however, Sullenberger told the Tracon controller the plane couldn't make it to that airport, and shortly afterward, the plane dropped into the Hudson. On Wednesday, the National Transportation Safety Board said both the plane's engines contained the remains of birds. The engines from Flight 1549 had been sent to the manufacturer in Cincinnati, Ohio, where the NTSB directed the analysis, the safety board said in a news release. Material from both engines was sent to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington for identification of the bird species. iReport.com: Passenger's perspective moments after crash .

"(CNN)For months, 20-year-old Christopher Lee Cornell had been on the FBI's radar. Authorities said he left alarming posts on social media, talking about violent jihad. On Wednesday, agents arrested the Cincinnati man before he could put his alleged plot into action. Authorities say Cornell, who ostensibly tweeted under the name Raheel Mahrus Ubaydah, hatched a simple scheme. It was similar to the Paris attack on the offices of Charlie Hebdo, but at a key location -- the U.S. Capitol, said a criminal complaint filed by an FBI agent. The plan: Set off pipe bombs to put lawmakers and employees in panicked flight and then gun them down with an assault rifle as they ran across his path and that of an accomplice, Special Agent T.A. Staderman wrote. Cornell was ready to go, the agent said. He had made preparations with a partner. He had researched bomb-making instructions and by Wednesday, Cornell had bought two M-15 rifles with 600 rounds of ammunition. But the man Cornell believed was his partner was actually an FBI informant, a man in trouble with the law who worked with the agency to improve his legal standing. When they found out Cornell had the weapons, authorities made their move before Cornell could make his. A law enforcement official told CNN that there was never any danger to lawmakers. Around lunchtime, more than a dozen agents and local police stood at his parents' house, where he had lived. ""We heard a pound on the door,"" John Cornell, Lee Cornell's father, told CNN's Anderson Cooper. Had he not opened it, they would have battered it in with a ram, he said. He had no idea why they were there, and the officers wouldn't tell him, he said. ""They just told us they had a search warrant."" They took the whole family in for questioning. ""Where is my son; what is he being charged with?"" John Cornell wanted to know. ""They wouldn't tell us anything,"" he said. In the fall, the informant told the FBI about someone he had been in touch with via Twitter, the criminal complaint said. At the end of August, Cornell had allegedly written him an instant message saying the two of them should carry out a lone wolf attack as a way of supporting ISIS. He didn't think ISIS or al Qaeda would give them an official sign-off, but he felt he didn't need it. ""... we already got a thumbs-up from the Brothers over there and Anwar al-Awlaki before his martyrdom and many others,"" Cornell allegedly wrote. Al-Awlaki was a U.S.-born radical cleric associated with Yemen's al Qaeda arm. He was killed in a drone attack in 2011, but his legacy seems to have influence on would-be terrorists around the world. Cornell allegedly told the informant that he had been in contact with people overseas, and that he had aligned himself with ISIS. And he grew closer to the informant. ""I believe we should meet up and make our own group in alliance with the Islamic State here and plan operations ourselves,"" Cornell allegedly messaged him. The anatomy of ISIS: How it is run . The two met twice in person in Cincinnati, the complaint said -- two days in October and two in November. Cornell researched how to build pipe bombs and saved up money to buy weapons and ammunition, the complaint read. His father casts doubt on some aspects of the purchase. Cornell was unemployed and worked only seasonally for minimum wage. He was about $500 short of the money needed to make the purchase on his own. ""He had $1,287 saved up. These guns cost over $1,700,"" John Cornell said. He thinks someone else had to make up the difference and blames the FBI. He thinks his son was pushed into the plan. Cornell wanted to make his ""move"" in December, the complaint said. He and the informant, posing as his partner, were to travel to Washington, scout out the Capitol and then detonate the bombs and open fire. Everything to know about the rise of ISIS . In middle school and high school, Cornell had been a wrestler, his father said. After graduation, he lived at home and was unemployed, not yet knowing what he wanted to do. ""He very seldom left the house,"" John Cornell said. ""He's a big mama's boy, you know. His best friend is his kitty cat. There's no way he could have carried out any kind of terrorist plot,"" Cornell's father said. ""He didn't even drive; he didn't have a car."" He had recently converted to Islam, which gave him inner peace, John Cornell said. And he had apparently stopped cutting his beard. On his mugshot at the Butler County Jail, it's long and appears untrimmed. But an ISIS follower? ""Heck no,"" John Cornell said. ""There's no way my son was involved with ISIS."" Later, he told CNN: ""I just want everyone to know that my son is not a monster. I'm not just saying that because he's my son. If I thought he was up to something, I would have beat his butt, and I would have been the first one to turn him in."" Mom will stay in jail until trial on ISIS-related charges . Cornell graduated from Oak Hills High School in 2012, where he was a ""typical student,"" the school district said. His teachers remember him as a quiet, but not too shy, student who participated in class. ""Christopher was not a disruption or a discipline problem in school,"" the school district said in a statement. ""His teachers were shocked at the news of his involvement in this situation."" According to the local police chief, Cornell had never been in serious trouble before either. He protested a ceremony in 2013 to commemorate the September 11, 2001, attacks, holding a sign that read ""9/11 was an inside job,"" Green Township Police Department Chief Bart West told CNN. But he was not arrested or detained. Cornell was also a person of interest in a case of vandalism in 2013, the chief said. Again, he was not charged. Cornell made a friend on the Internet, his father believes, and posted comments in defense of Muslims. ""Chris may have said some things out of anger,"" John Cornell said. But he has a hard time believing his son encouraged armed jihad. Once, after his son stayed out with a friend once for two hours, John Cornell asked him where he'd been. ""He said that he had went to a mosque,"" John Cornell said. Then Chris moved out quietly. ""I never seen him leave,"" his father said. His son left him a note in his former bedroom. It said he had decided to move in with a friend, who had also offered him some work. Since his son's arrest, he says he and his wife have not heard anything from officials about where Cornell is. They say they love their son more than ever, and that they are heartbroken. ""He may be facing life in prison,"" John Cornell said. ""Do you know how devastating that is?"" CNN's Dave Alsup, Joe Sutton, Alexandra Field, Ryan Buckley and Teri Genova contributed to this report.","Christopher Lee Cornell, 20, allegedly aligned himself with ISIS .

"ANTIGUA, Guatemala (CNN) -- For many years, Guatemala has been a place of relatively uncomplicated adoptions for American parents. The small country's government estimates as many as 17 babies leave each day for adoptive parents in the United States. Carolina, a 3-month-old Guatemalan girl, was bound for the U.S. until Guatemalan authorities intervened. But that number could soon drop to zero because of concerns over alleged improprieties in the Guatemalan adoption process. Guatemalan President Oscar Berger announced recently that adoptions to the United States will be suspended on January 1, 2008, a decision that could leave nearly 3,000 babies currently in the adoption pipeline in legal limbo. ""This is our heritage, our future,"" said Carmen Wennier, head of Guatemala's Social Welfare bureau, who has criticized the adoption system. Guatemala has the highest per capita rate of adoption in the world and the United States represents the largest number of adoptions, with an estimated one of every 100 Guatemalan babies sent to the United States, according to the U.S. consulate in Guatemala. U.S. officials estimate more than 5,000 adoptions from Guatemala will be processed this year, an annual high which would make Guatemala the second biggest origin of adoptive babies to the United States, behind China.  Adoption on hold after agency raided » . Adoption has been a hotly contested issue in Guatemala for years. While adoptive parents in the United States undergo rigorous screening, adoptions in Guatemala are processed under a notary system that allows lawyers and judges to place children for adoption. Both Guatemalan and U.S. officials fear the system leads to practices such as paying birth mothers for children, or, some instances, using coercion. ""We have thousands of cases of Guatemalan children who have been adopted to the United States and have had terrific experiences as adoptive children there, and frankly, have probably experienced a life more full of opportunity and support than they would have if they had been abandoned in Guatemala,"" U.S. Ambassador to Guatemala James Derham said. ""What we want to do is make sure that all adoptions are consistent with these kinds of ideas."" Both U.S. and Guatemalan officials say gaps in the regulation and the high sums of money at play - adoptions can cost up to $30,000 to complete -- may have created unintended incentives in a country where the U.S. State Department estimates 80 percent of the population lives in poverty. For prospective adoptive parents awaiting children in the United States, the recent developments are wrenching. But despite the State Department warnings, dozens of Americans still fill major hotels in Guatemala City meeting babies they expect will soon be theirs. Several hotels in the city offer adoption packages and baby-friendly amenities to prospective adoptive parents. The couples stay there when they come to first see the babies while waiting for paperwork to be processed or to pick them up at the end of the adoption process. Many of those couples say the charges of coercion of birth mothers are overblown and that thousands of abandoned children will be condemned to a life of poverty if greater restrictions on adoptions are imposed. ""Nobody reports on what will happen to these children if the adoptions are stopped,"" said one American parent who asked not to be identified. ""The city will be filled with street kids."" The increasing scrutiny of adoptions from Guatemala already has thrown some adoptions into flux. Carolina, a 3-month-old Guatemalan girl, was just months away from joining her adoptive parents, Ellen and Sean Darcy, in their Boston, Massachusetts, home, when she and 45 other babies were seized from Casa Quivira, an adoption agency, by the Guatemalan government. ""Casa Quivira was the last stop on an assembly line,"" Wennier told CNN. ""They had the final product and they had to sell it at the best price."" Guatemala police arrested Casa Quivira's lawyers and charged them with child abduction. No plea has yet been entered, but the agency's owners, American Cliff Phillips and his Guatemalan wife, Sandra Gonzalez, deny doing anything illegal. ""We can respond for the work of Casa Quivira and we will make all the efforts to clear our name, to get these kids home,"" Gonzalez said through tears. She adamantly denies Casa Quivira wanted to do anything more than help save children from poverty and make American families whole. Carolina's adoptive mom in the United States, Ellen Darcy, is worried about Carolina's future, but she wants the investigation to go forward so she'll know if the adoption was legitimate. ""We want to know. We don't want to complete an adoption that is anything but completely legal and where this little girl has been relinquished willingly,"" she said. The Darcy's already have one child they adopted from Guatemala, a boy named Dylan, and they were excited for Carolina's arrival. In Guatemala, birth mothers are required to sign a document in court in which they state they are relinquishing their child, but they are not interviewed by a judge as to their reasons. To stem corruption, the U.S. Embassy has added its own requirement that birth mothers appear with the baby when proceedings to request a Visa for the baby begin. In August, they also began requiring two DNA tests to confirm the identities of mother and child. But proponents of stricter adoption guidelines in Guatemala said that even those tests are not sufficient. The Guatemalan Office of the Attorney General said it has 80 confirmed cases so far this year of adoption irregularities, including baby stealing and false DNA tests. The Guatemalan Chief Prosecutor's Office recently launched a criminal investigation into the two laboratories contracted to take DNA samples from birth mothers and the children. The U.S. Consulate and adoptive parents said those allegations do not taint the more than 4,000 adoptions that were processed legitimately last year. But due to the uncertainty expected from then anticipated changes in process, the State Department has recently issued a warning advising American citizens not to initiate any new adoptions from Guatemala. Like other parents and prospective parents, Ellen Darcy, as she waits in her Boston home for baby Carolina, is concerned about the children. ""I'm not worried about the American couples. That's a non-issue. I'm worried about the kids,"" she said. ""If they aren't given an option to be raised abroad, that they will perish and spend their entire childhood in an orphanage in state custody with nobody to encourage them or be a parent or take a vested interest in them. The American parents will be fine. It's the kids."" E-mail to a friend .","Guatemala has long been a source of relatively fast, uncomplicated adoptions .

"U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met Iraqi leaders Monday as radical Sunni militants continue their march toward Baghdad during the country's tensest time since the U.S. withdrawal of troops in 2011. ""The future of Iraq depends on decisions made in the next few days and weeks,"" Kerry said after meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, the man who some observers say needs to step down. Al-Maliki has agreed to a July 1 deadline to begin the process to form a new government, a requirement for U.S. assistance in fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, Kerry said. ""Our support will be intense, sustained,"" and will be effective if Iraqi leaders unite to face the militant threat, he said. With al-Maliki's Shiite-led government losing more ground to ISIS, Kerry implored the leader to rise above ""sectarian motivations"" to become more inclusive and make the government more representative of Iraq's population. Map: On the ground, who controls what? Kerry also met with Iraq's foreign minister as well as Shiite and Sunni leaders. Al-Malaki's office issued a statement after his meeting with Kerry, saying the Prime Minister told Kerry the current situation ""poses a threat"" not only to Iraq but the region as well. Al-Malaki ""called on the countries of the world, especially countries in the region, to take it seriously,"" the statement said. But outside the rooms of high-level talks, parts of Iraq are falling by the day. Here's the latest on the crisis that is spilling far beyond Iraq's borders: . Where is Iraq's military? The United States believes ""multiple Iraqi military divisions"" outside Baghdad have dissolved and are plagued by problems in morale, leadership, training and equipment, according to a senior U.S. defense official. ""The readiness outside of Baghdad is certainly in question as they have ceded multiple towns. Forces in Baghdad seems to be holding today,"" the official said. The United States believes there are around 10,000 fighters who are either affiliated with ISIS or members of the group, the official said, and while they are stretched thin over vast territory, they are getting support in the Sunni areas they increasingly control. Kerry said Monday in Baghdad that President Barack Obama has prepared ""a range of options for Iraq,"" including enhanced intelligence, joint operations centers, military advisers and ""steady supplies of munitions."" But the United States is being more careful about sending additional weapons and ammunition to Iraq, because of a  lack of confidence in the Iraqi troops, the defense official said. ISIS captures more ground . Militant fighters believed to be ISIS have seized the Baiji oil refinery, the largest in Iraq, three Iraqi security sources told CNN Monday. Earlier in the day, an Iraqi military spokesman had said that an attack was under way, but had been repelled by security forces. CNN cannot independently confirm either claim. The Baiji refinery is a key strategic resource because it refines much of the fuel needed for internal consumption. There are already long lines at many gas stations across the country. ISIS militants also advanced toward Baghdad over the weekend from the north and the west. At least 70% of Anbar province is now under the control of ISIS, two security officials in the region told CNN. ISIS is on a mission to create an Islamic state across Sunni areas of Iraq and in Syria. Militants have taken over the Tal Afar airbase in northern Iraq as well as the city of Tal Afar, officials said. On Monday, Iraqi troops prepared to recapture the airbase, Iraqi Maj. Gen. Abu al-Waleed said. ""At least 1,000 Iraqi troops have amassed to the north of Tal Afar and are firing rockets at militants in control of the city,""  he said. The fighters also seized the western Anbar town of Rutba, 70 miles (113 kilometers) from the borders of Jordan and Saudi Arabia, security sources in Baghdad and Anbar told CNN on Sunday. Then there's Qaim. ISIS captured the city along the Syrian border Saturday, and the militants now enjoy a stronghold and a number of other towns in Anbar province. The fighters have a direct line to the western outskirts of Baghdad, where tension simmers just beneath the surface. Checkpoints in the capital seemed to pop up overnight, particularly the closer one got to central Baghdad. Security forces appeared to be controlling access to neighborhoods through a mix of checkpoints and road closures. Dozens of prisoners, five police killed . At least 71 prisoners and five police officers were killed Monday when militants attacked an Iraqi police convoy transferring inmates from one prison to another, police said. Five militants were also killed. It was not immediately clear whether ISIS was behind the attack. The convoy was traveling from Hilla, a predominately Shiite city south of Baghdad, to another prison north of the city. Police did not provide further details about the attack. Iraq's military is accusing ISIS of carrying out massacres. ""Hundreds of Iraqi soldiers have been beheaded and hung and their bodies have been desecrated,"" said Iraq's military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Qassim Atta. ""Why has the U.N. not decried these atrocious crimes, which are among the biggest crimes against humanity?"" Sharia law spreads . One of ISIS' biggest victories came when it took over Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, this month. On Sunday, witnesses said militants paraded around the city in vehicles, announcing on loudspeakers that they have decided to form Islamic Sharia courts in Mosul. Sharia law covers religious and nonreligious aspects of life, and ISIS has begun imposing Sharia law in the towns it controls. Boys and girls must be separated at school. Women must wear the niqab, or full veil, in public. Music is banned, and fasting is enforced during Ramadan. The military denies huge losses . But Iraq's military said it's not losing as much ground to ISIS as some may think. The military made a ""strategic withdrawal"" in some areas, Atta, the military spokesman, told reporters. He said the withdrawals were part of a campaign to ""open all these fronts so we can strengthen our positions."" But Atta did not detail the specific locations. Two security officials told CNN that Iraqi forces have withdrawn from Haditha, 168 miles (about 270 kilometers) northwest of Baghdad. But even if some withdrawals were strategic, it's unclear when or how Iraqi forces could retake areas now in the hands of well-armed ISIS fighters. The military said it has fought back against militants with airstrikes. Officials showed reporters footage of airstrikes they said took place in Tal Afar. Atta said the video showed a ""large number of ISIS forces fleeing these strikes"" that left up to 50 people dead. Recruiting station gets pummeled . Apparently, those trying to join Iraqi forces are at risk before they even enlist. In the Shiite-dominated Hilla, at least four people were killed in a shelling attack on a recruiting station. Another 34 people were wounded. Hundreds of predominantly Shiite men went to the recruiting station to answer a call to arms to protect Iraq. U.S. sends more help . The U.S. will have a greater presence in Iraq aside from Kerry's visit this week. About 300 U.S. military advisers will arrive, a senior defense official said. They will not be deployed all at once. The United States has reached an agreement with the Iraqi government over legal protection for those advisers, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said Monday. ""We believe these protections are adequate to the short-term assessment and advisory mission our troops will be performing in Iraq.   With this agreement, we will be able to start establishing the first few assessment teams,"" he said. In addition, some U.S. military personnel already at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad will be reassigned and become advisers. The first military advisers will focus on assessing the strengths and weaknesses of Iraqi security forces, U.S. officials said. The advisers will also assess what Iraqi military equipment and weapons may now be in the hands of ISIS, and try to get better intelligence on ISIS strategy, weapons, and movements of its fighters. But Obama said there's only so much the United States can do. ""Part of the task now is to see whether Iraqi leaders are prepared to rise above sectarian motivations, come together, compromise,"" the President told CNN's Kate Bolduan. ""If they can't, there's not going to be a military solution to this problem. There's no amount of American firepower that's going to be able to hold the country together, and I've made that very clear to Mr. Maliki and all the other leadership inside of Iraq.""

"(CNN) -- Government agents used tear gas to disperse demonstrators, and beat and kidnapped a human rights lawyer, the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran said Saturday, citing witnesses. Protesters in Tehran linger after powerful cleric Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani ended his Friday prayers. The advocacy group said human rights lawyer Shadi Sadr, who was walking with friends to Friday prayers, was confronted by people dressed in civilian clothes. They pushed her into a car and drove off, the group said, citing witnesses. In a subsequent telephone call to her husband, Sadr said she had been arrested and detained in ward 209 of Tehran's Evin prison, the group said. ""Her husband reported that intelligence officers had searched his house and requested the keys to her legal office,"" the group said. Sadr suffers from gland and bone problems, needs medication, and was scheduled to undergo an operation next week, the group said. It said several other human rights lawyers, including Abdolfattah Soltani, Kambiz Nourouzi and Mohammed Ali Dadkhah, have been detained in recent days. Friday's crackdown came as leading cleric and former President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani called for Iranian intelligence and security forces to obey the law and to release detained protesters. Police used tear gas on demonstrators and beat and arrested at least 40 of them, taking them away in the trunks of unmarked cars, a witness told the campaign.  Watch CNN's Reza Sayah report on violence in Iran » . The campaign called for the release of more than 2,000 people it said have been arrested since the contested June 12 elections that officially gave incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad a landslide victory. It also called on the United Nations and the Human Rights Council to travel to Iran to investigate. Because of government restrictions on international journalists, CNN is not able to confirm the report. In a separate statement, Amnesty International said arrests in Iran of civil society activists like Shadi Sadr appear to be intensifying. ""This was an illegal, arbitrary and violent arrest in which no attempt was made by the authorities to show identification or provide any explanation for their action,"" said Malcolm Smart, director of Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa Programme.","International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran cites witnesses of kidnapping .

"(CNN) -- In another move to crack down on information flowing out of Iran, the Islamic Republic's judicial chief has ordered the prosecution of individuals ""who cooperate with satellite television programming providers,"" a reformist newspaper reported Sunday. Iran's judicial chief reportedly has ordered the prosecution of people who ""collaborate"" with satellite TV networks. ""The individuals, who in any way collaborate with these networks or are entrenched in the nucleus of organizations which are active through Internet sites, must be adequately and properly subject to legal actions. It is imperative that this phenomenon be seriously dealt with by all judicial authorities of the country as well as by provincial judicial authorities,"" Ayatollah Seyyed Mahmoud Hashemi-Shahroudi said in his order, which was quoted by the newspaper Hamshahri. The ayatollah called on local judicial heads to work with investigators to determine ""intentions, objectives and their sources of financial, political and intelligence support"" of individuals who ""operate against the system,"" according to Hamshahri, a widely circulated pro-reform publication that has been in print for more than a decade. The scope of the reported threat and whether it was referring to international networks, reporters and stringers was not immediately clear. Because international journalists have been limited in their ability to gather news in Iran, CNN has not been able to confirm the news report. However, the government has been trying to limit the flow of online information and other forms of communications in Iran, according to activists and human rights officials. Since June 12, when disputed presidential election results sent tens of thousands of Iranians into the streets to protest, the world got a front-row view of the unrest thanks largely to dissidents using online tools to spread the news. News from Internet users has been important as Iran's government began kicking out some reporters from traditional media outlets, arresting others and restricting the movements of those who remained. More than 1,000 people have been arrested over the election fallout, including several journalists, according to the international human rights watchdog Amnesty International. Most recently, the semi-official Fars News Agency reported that a journalist for Newsweek magazine who was arrested in Tehran confessed to doing the bidding of Western governments, though CNN could not verify the report. Maziar Bahari, 42, made his alleged confession at a news conference Tuesday. Fars reported that the Canadian-Iranian reporter, who had worked for the BBC and England's Channel 4 network, admitted having filed false reports for Newsweek during the elections. The magazine has rejected the allegation. CNN's Doug Gross contributed to this report.","Reported move follows other efforts by Iran to slow information coming out of country .

"(CNN) -- Futuristic. Space-age. A 'world symbol.' An 'icon for an icon.' Given Real Madrid is listed by Forbes as the world's most valuable sports team, perhaps it's understandable there is a tinge of hyperbole in the marketing of the redevelopment of Real Madrid's home -- the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu . ""We were inspired by medieval cathedrals, with all their sculptures and paintings around the building telling their stories,"" Volkwin Marg, who heads up the German architectural firm Gerkan, Marg and Partners that designed the new arena, told CNN. When its proposed refurbishment ends in around six years' time, the Bernabeu -- where Real beat great rivals Barcelona on Saturday -- will be wrapped in a skin of LEDs and 'polished mirror.' Housing a retail area, restaurants and hotel among the attractions under its metallic membrane, the multipurpose arena will transform a stadium where construction began 70 years ago today. Its new exterior will also be able to beam out the most famous moments of the 10-time European champions upon completion, although that date is still uncertain due to legal wrangles. ""For this 'holy grail', we have created a glass podium designed as a communications screen displaying the history of Real Madrid -- which appears as a huge screen from the outside,"" said Marg. ""The stadium's skin is polished like a mirror and it will glow and vibrate thanks to the LED lighting system."" Bold, state-of-the-art and televisual --the venue will be unimaginably distant to the wartime rubble where Real Madrid began its rise from the ashes. Literally so since the wooden stands at the old Chamartin stadium, adjacent to where work started on the Bernabeu on October 27 1944, had been broken down for firewood by those trying to survive the 1936-1939 Spanish Civil War. That was far from the only damage inflicted upon both the Chamartin and Madrid during the fighting. The Spanish capital suffered immensely as it became the first European city to ever be bombed but the Republican stronghold held firm against General Francisco Franco's Nationalists until just four days before the war's end. Five years later, it was the legendary figure of Santiago Bernabeu -- who had been elected Real president in 1943 -- who wielded the pickaxe that first broke ground on the stadium that would bear his name. Yet a betrayal within Real meant the former youth team player, captain and manager almost never had the chance to shape the club's destiny. ""On the outbreak of war, Bernabeu, unsure of how the wind was to blow, went into hiding, taking refuge in the French Embassy,"" wrote Phil Ball in his book 'White Storm: 101 years of Real Madrid'. ""As a good example of how Republican Real Madrid was at that time, Carlos Alonso, coordinator of the club's administration and an outspoken Communist, actually reported Bernabeu to the authorities. ""In this overwhelmingly anti-fascist atmosphere, it was only the intervention of the Spanish Ambassador to France that saved Santiago's bacon."" Whether this incident prompted Bernabeu to turn against the Republicans is unclear but what is known is that he fought for the Nationalists -- with distinction -- during the war. ""If Franco hadn't won the war, nobody would ever have heard of Bernabeu -- that much is true,"" Ball told CNN. Despite his initial uncertainties, the qualifier lawyer had backed the right side in the war and having helped the Francoists take power, they assisted his revival of a club that had been largely destroyed by the fighting -- with even its trophy cabinet stripped bare. With a bank of credit from his experiences at war and with Real -- for whom the former striker scored nearly 350 goals -- Bernabeu used his connections to create his phoenix. ""To buy a stadium, you need to buy land and you need credit for that,"" Ball explained. ""Bernabeu was quite well known, and had been decorated in the Civil War."" ""The Banco Mercantil lent him the money but they weren't stupid -- there was a future in earning collateral through Real Madrid."" Even if they were ranked below city rivals Atletico Madrid, Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona at the time. The stadium, which opened in 1947, took shape in what was then a verdant part of northern Madrid but the city's growth means the prestigious bank-lined Paseo de la Castellana is now in the center. The challenge for today's architects is to build the stadium, whose capacity will increase from 85,454 to 90,000, within its urban confines. ""I think it will become one of the most iconic stadiums in the world, and the special thing is that it will sit very tightly in the center of a vital town,"" said Marg. ""Normally if you have a stadium in the middle of town, then it tends to be a big black dirt box. It's not a shiny thing living together with the life of the town and this will be the new effect of this building."" ""It's a very complex building and it's going to be a 24-hour stadium -- open all the time."" That's because Real Madrid will effectively play their home games alongside a massive mall, crammed with shops, restaurants and business lounges to sit alongside the hotel, improved club museum and underground parking. ""It was a challenge to make a new type of stadium -- a real urban stadium, which is not just one-functional, as in a pitch surrounded by spectators, but a multipurpose arena with a retractable roof,"" said Marg. ""Everybody who comes will say 'where is the old stadium?' It will be hidden in the new one."" ""Florentino Perez, who was absolutely engaged in this project, wants to write history in stadium building,"" added Marg, referring to Real's current president. ""He asked for an 'icon for an icon' but as a clever businessman, he also wanted this icon to earn more money than the existing stadium."" The retractable roof, which can open in 15 minutes, will allow the stadium to host events such as music concerts safe in the knowledge that inclement weather will be no danger. Fittingly for an arena that installed the first ever video screens, the stadium will also present a video screen 'ring' under the roof that can be seen from every seat in the stadium -- including those in the hotel rooms and business lounges that open onto the pitch. ""We want it to be the best stadium in the world, with maximum comfort, an icon of architecture and cutting edge,"" said Perez when the plans were unveiled earlier this year. ""It will be a world symbol."" The construction magnate has a big call to make though. To fund -- or partly fund -- a project costing a reported 400 million euros ($507 million), Perez is looking to sell naming rights to the refurbished Bernabeu. One heavily linked party is the International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC), with whom Real are set to announce a partnership agreement on Tuesday. This will initially be in relation to general sponsorship but Spanish media is also tipping the Abu Dhabi group to buy the naming rights. A report by website 'Soy Madridista' even suggests IPIC could have full naming rights, removing any mention of Santiago Bernabeu -- a move which could upset Real fans, should they cough up over a billion euros to build a new stadium in a different part of town. This rumor has arisen given the legal obstacles currently challenging the refurbishment plans, with a Spanish court suspending the plans because Real is currently under investigation by the European Commission. This is in relation to possible illegal state aid, meaning a key agreement between Real and the Madrid government with regard to the remodeled Bernabeu is temporarily suspended. Nonetheless, a Real spokesperson told CNN last week that the work on the existing site will start in ""around two years' time."" Meanwhile, the architects of a space-age stadium are pressing ahead with plans for takeoff. ""We are now preparing everything,"" said Marg. ""We are just waiting for the green light.""","Construction work on the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium started 70 years ago today .

"(CNN) -- The announcement by senior Nigerian military and government officials that an agreement has been reached with Boko Haram for the release of more than 200 kidnapped Chibok girls is welcome, although it has understandably been greeted with considerable caution. And news that a ceasefire has also been agreed, and that further negotiations will take place, is another positive development. But this is a case when we will actually need to see the girls emerging from their six-month confinement before we can truly believe. After all, it was only recently that it was announced that Abubakar Shekau, reputed leader of the jihadist group, had supposedly been killed ... again. Yet Shekau, or someone proclaiming to be him, probably lives on in a country where much political, economic and now military affairs take place in the shadows. The problem with establishing what is really going on in Nigeria, and with Boko Haram specifically, is that after five years of warfare and many casualties, there is much that is still uncertain about the group. Indeed, it appears to be both an actual organization and a brand name for banditry. Early reports have claimed that the meetings that resulted in the alleged agreement with Boko Haram took place in Ndjamena, the capital of neighboring Chad, which itself is firmly under the control of an autocratic government. But it is difficult to know for sure what is going on in Nigeria, a place where a significant part of business is conducted by a shadowy combination of political, military, and business individuals. And this is creating even bigger problems for Nigeria than the national and global demands for the girls' rescue. For a start, it has been unclear how Boko Haram is financed -- and how much assistance it might be receiving from disaffected members of the northern Nigerian elite, as well as those holding government positions at the federal and state levels. ""Underground"" campaigns involving the use of armed thugs have been a staple feature of Nigerian party politics for decades, and international human rights groups have noted a ""dirty war"" conducted by soldiers and government-financed militias. These abuses, combined with the dysfunction of the armed forces, complicate external assistance. The problem for Nigeria is that although the jihadists will eventually almost certainly be crushed, as were the secessionists in Nigeria's civil war, the clock is ticking on a greater threat to the Nigerian nation, namely popular protests in northern Nigeria following February's presidential poll, which President Goodluck Jonathan is certain to contest. Boko Haram is a militant, cultist variant of Islamism, and it continues to challenge the secular Nigerian state. Its campaign has tapped into widespread disaffection in the northern region of at least 80 million people, which has been in decline even as the rest of the country experiences economic growth. This is the backdrop to the unfolding drama of the kidnapped girls, who themselves have become pawns in a multilayered drama. If the negotiations announced Friday are genuine, Boko Haram -- which has muscled its way onto the global stage by mimicking jihadist declarations and terrorist actions of others, including the use of suicide bombers -- can command a high price for their release. While the group is still largely a Nigerian phenomenon, and although such militant groups have previously been overwhelmed by the brutal force for which Nigerian soldiers and police are known, Boko Haram is more tenacious and resilient than its predecessors. Moreover, it is now fortified by a powerful global jihadist ideology. So, how should the Nigerian government respond? Friday's announcement suggests that the Chibok girls are alive and well; and a rational course for Boko Haram would be to negotiate an amnesty with the government, following the example of the Delta insurgents. But the announcement, if it can be believed, has implications that stretch beyond these girls' fortunes. Indeed, the campaign for the Nigerian presidency has effectively merged with the campaign to defeat Boko Haram. This means that if the government is successful in brokering a lasting ceasefire with Boko Haram and bringing home these girls, Goodluck Jonathan would undoubtedly get a significant boost in his reelection efforts. With a multi-billion government trough at his disposal, it would be hard to bet against him come February. But the way this ""deal"" unfolds will have significant implications for his electoral chances and the peace and political stability of Africa's largest nation.","Boko Haram has reportedly agreed to free more than 200 schoolgirls who were kidnapped earlier this year .

"It's given us robot cars and internet-enabled glasses -- but when it came to creating a ""Street View"" of a desert, Google hit on a low-tech solution. It hired a camel. The beast has become the first animal to carry Google's Trekker camera, which is typically hoisted by humans to capture 360-degree images of destinations inaccessible to its Street View cars. Google spokeswoman Monica Baz says the camel, reportedly named Raffia, was an apt way of documenting the beautiful shifting sands of Abu Dhabi's Liwa Oasis. ""With every environment and every location, we try to customize the capture and how we do it for that part of the environment,"" she told The National newspaper. ""In the case of Liwa we fashioned it in a way so that it goes on a camel so that it can capture imagery in the best, most authentic and least damaging way,"" Baz said. The Liwa Oasis is a 100 kilometer-wide (62-mile) scenic desert, southeast of the city of Abu Dhabi that includes some of the world's biggest sand dunes. Bizarre sights . Street View Treks have previously explored sites including the Grand Canyon, Mount Everest, the Eiffel Tower, the Egyptian pyramids and the complexes of temples around Angkor Wat in Cambodia. There's even an subaquatic Trek of waters around the Galapagos islands. Of course, while the camel can only be seen in shadow on the images it captured, Google's Street View cars have witnessed plenty of other bizarre sights. Earlier this year one clocked what appeared to be the scene of an ax murder on the streets of Edinburgh. It later turned out to be a prank staged by auto mechanics who'd spotted the car on its approach. Another hoax involved a woman pretending to give birth on a roadside. The service, which began in 2007, has also hosted more startling sights such as a naked guy climbing out the trunk of a car and a man with the head of a horse.","Abu Dhabi's Liwa Oasis is captured using a Google Trekker camera attached to a camel .

"Qom, Iran (CNN)  -- Tens of thousands of people chanted anti-government slogans Monday before the funeral of a top Iranian cleric who turned into one of the regime's most vocal critics, a witness said. They shouted ""death to the dictator!"" outside the home of senior Iranian dissident Grand Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, who died early Sunday. He was 87. Montazeri -- a key figure in Iran's Islamic Revolution 30 years ago -- was perhaps the most prominent cleric who publicly criticized the presidential elections last June that returned hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to the presidency. Protesters and mourners began to gather near his home in this holy city around 7 a.m., swelling to huge numbers by the time the funeral procession began, said the witness. Both uniformed and plain clothes security forces turned out for the funeral, with the undercover officers arriving in several buses and mingling with the crowds. The witness did not see any clashes but said tensions were high as protesters stood and chanted just steps away from security forces. Many of the protesters and mourners had driven to Qom, where Montazeri lived, from Tehran and other cities hundreds of miles away, the witness said. Mourners from Najafabad, Montazeri's hometown, passed out dates, an Iranian tradition at funerals. The night before the funeral, chants of ""God is great"" -- which the opposition uses as a rallying cry -- could be heard in several Tehran neighborhoods. The chants were louder than usual, witnesses said. Around 300 to 400 people gathered at Tehran's Mother's Square and lit candles on Sunday night in memory of Montazeri, several sources told CNN. The witnesses did not see any clashes between security forces and the people at the gathering. CNN is not naming its sources to protect their security. Writing on his Web site after the disputed June presidential elections, Montazeri described the street protests that followed the polling as a challenge to the ""very legitimacy of the Islamic Republic."" His death is ""a terrible blow for the (reformist) green movement and everybody who has been active these past few months,"" said Mehrdad Khonsari, a senior research consultant at the Centre for Arab and Iranian Studies in London. ""He was a very senior grand ayatollah with very good revolutionary credentials, and a very vocal critic of the ruling establishment,"" Khonsari said. ""He was a major thorn in the back of (Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali) Khamenei. He was a bastion for all the people opposing the excesses of the system,"" even within the ruling establishment, he said. In the last six months, Montazeri had become the voice of the green movement on key foreign policy issues, Khonsari said. The cleric was able to comment more freely than reformist presidential candidates. Montazeri, for example, took a public stand against nuclear weapons in October, issuing a fatwa, or religious edict, declaring them to be ""un-Islamic"" and instructing Muslims to take the lead in banning them, said Nazenin Ansari, diplomatic editor of the weekly newspaper Kayhan in London. Iran's nuclear program has been the subject of intense international concern, with the United Nations considering expanding sanctions against the Islamic state despite its insistence it does not intend to build a bomb. ""He has a very large public following especially since the June elections and all his statements in favor of human rights,"" Ansari said . Montazeri's Web site called for a funeral procession from his home to the Massoumeh Shrine in Qom, the holy city where he lived, starting at 9 a.m. on Monday (12:30 a.m. ET). Demonstrations at the burial could spill over into the capital, Ansari said. ""Qom is very close to Tehran and this is a major event,"" she said, adding that it is difficult to predict what would happen. ""It would be questionable how a lot of the foot soldiers of the revolution would react."" The timing of his death could also be significant, she said, since it comes in the month that first saw the demonstrations that spiraled into the revolution that toppled the monarchy and brought the Islamic regime to power. Montazeri was once a confidant of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who led Iran for a decade after the revolution. He studied under Khomeini and then acted as his representative in Iran after Khomeini was exiled by the shah for criticizing the monarchy, Ansari said. Montazeri, too, was jailed and exiled. After the revolution, he was the heir apparent to Khomeini, and played a key role in writing Iran's constitution as the first chair of the powerful Guardians Council. He was also the leader of Friday prayers in Tehran, one of the most public and influential pulpits in the country. But he was supplanted by the current supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and was placed under several years of house arrest in 1997. ""His problems with Khomeini started in the summer of 1988 when they started executing... thousands of leftist prisoners,"" Ansari said. ""He never was in agreement with that, and then he started to fade"" from power. ""Once Khamenei became leader, Montazeri objected,"" she said. Montazeri said Khamenei ""was elevated above his (religious) qualifications,"" pointing out that he had not earned the title of ayatollah. ""It was then he was arrested."" Recently he has objected to the current regime's characterization of his one-time mentor Khomeini as a saint, she added. And following the disputed elections in June, ""he issued a ground-breaking fatwa articulating the policies of the (reformist) green movement to the world. Montazeri had been equally critical of the parliamentary electoral process in 2004, arguing in favor of reformist candidates. Sitting behind his desk with a government minder in the room, he said then that Iran's Islamic revolution had lost its way. ""Even I, who used to be a leading figure in the revolution, have not the right to speak out,"" he said. ""Authoritarianism will never last long. The gentlemen in power must submit to the wishes of the people, or they will be swept away."" CNN's Reza Sayah and Richard Allen Greene contributed to this report.","Thousands chant anti-government chants at cleric's funeral .

"Days after a very public termination from the Current TV network, controversial on-air personality Keith Olbermann admitted he ""screwed up,"" in an appearance on ""The Late Show with David Letterman"" Tuesday evening. ""I screwed up really big on this,"" the former ""Countdown"" host conceded. ""It's my fault that it didn't succeed, in the sense that I didn't think the whole thing through."" However, the transient host's admission of guilt was not without a backhanded analogy. ""If you buy a $10 million chandelier, you should have a house to put it in,"" Olbermann said. ""Just walking around with a $10 million chandelier isn't going to do anybody a lot of good"" -- a comparison that invited Letterman to quip, ""You're the chandelier?"" Letterman also presented Olbermann with an adjustable business card that could switch out Olbermann's various former employers. Current TV's co-founders, including former Vice President Al Gore, announced March 30 that the network was ousting its highest-profile on-air personality, Keith Olbermann. ""Current was ... founded on the values of respect, openness, collegiality and loyalty to our viewers,"" Gore and Joel Hyatt wrote in an ""open letter"" to viewers on the network's website. ""Unfortunately these values are no longer reflected in our relationship with Keith Olbermann, and we have ended it."" Olbermann responded sharply in a series of Twitter messages on the day of his dismissal, saying that for more than a year he had been ""imploring"" Gore and Hyatt ""to resolve our issues internally."" He did not specify what those issues were. ""Nevertheless, Mr. Gore and Mr. Hyatt, instead of abiding by their promises and obligations and investing in a quality news program, finally thought it was more economical to try to get out of my contract,"" the left-wing news personality wrote. ""It goes almost without saying that the claims against me in Current's statement are untrue and will be proved so in the legal actions I will be filing against them presently,"" Olbermann added, vowing later that the ""truth of the ethics"" of Gore and Hyatt eventually ""will come out."" Besides its statement, Current TV offered no further comment. This marks the second time in 15 months that Olbermann has abruptly left a news network. In January 2011, he cut ties with MSNBC after eight years. In that time, the former sports news anchor became a favorite of progressives for challenging rivals at Fox News and elsewhere. But he also faced criticism and publicly aired his frustrations with NBC's management. The 53-year-old was suspended from MSNBC for two days after the news website Politico revealed  he had made donations to three Democrats. Weeks after leaving MSNBC, Olbermann inked a deal with Current Media, a company founded by Gore and Hyatt. Besides hosting and producing his new prime-time nightly news and commentary show, Olbermann was named Current Media's chief news officer and had an equity stake in the company. He relaunched his signature ""Countdown"" show in June, showcasing a host of liberal-leaning guests and the return of his ""Special Comment"" segment. In his Twitter statement Friday, Olbermann said his decision to join Current was ""sincere and well intentioned ... on my part, but in retrospect a foolish one."" ""That lack of judgment is mine and mine alone, and I apologize again for it,"" he wrote. His immediate replacement in the network's 8 p.m. slot will be former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer, Gore and Hyatt announced. Spitzer hosted a prime-time CNN show from September 2010 until July, when ""In the Arena"" was canceled as part of an evening lineup shuffle. He had resigned as New York's governor in 2008 after it was revealed that he visited a high-priced prostitute. He joins a network -- whose current president, David Bohrman, was CNN's former Washington bureau chief -- that is available via cable or satellite TV in 60 million U.S. households and in an additional 11 million internationally, according to Current's website. The network notes that it has won two Emmys, a Peabody award and various other honors.","Keith Olbermann says, ""I screwed up,"" referring to his short stint at Current TV .

"Just four Formula One drivers turned up to Roland Ratzenberger's funeral after his death during qualifying for the San Marino Grand Prix on April 30 1994. The 33-year-old Austrian driver's passing was overshadowed by events that took place 24 hours later when three-time world champion Ayrton Senna was killed in Sunday's race at the Imola circuit. On the 20th anniversary of that tragic weekend, it's Senna's death that still haunts the sport while Ratzenberger's fate has largely been ignored. ""He's the forgotten man of Formula 1,"" said former track rival Johnny Herbert, who was one of the drivers at Ratzenberger's funeral. ""Forgotten to many, but not to me."" Ratzenberger was competing in only the third grand prix of his F1 career when the mountings on his Simtek car's front wing became dislodged on his warm-up lap after hitting a curb in qualifying. Exiting the Tamburello corner, which would become synonymous with Senna's fatal accident, on the next lap, the wing broke and he went careering into a concrete wall at the Villeneuve Curve head on at 200 mph. While Senna's death spawned all manner of books and an eponymous documentary of his life, Ratzenberger's was a mere snapshot in that superb film. And while an estimated three million people flocked to the streets of Sao Paulo for Senna's funeral, about 250 people were in Salzburg as Ratzenberger was laid to rest. Herbert was among them, paying his respects to a friendship that first started in 1985 when the pair were vying for victory in the prestigious Formula Ford Festival in England. ""I always think about Roland,"" three-time grand prix winner Herbert told CNN. ""I miss him even now. I think about him at certain points particularly at the European races. Monaco's always one. ""The year before he died we had a nice dinner there -- then he was trying to get into F1. I remember him saying he was the better driver and I'd only got into a drive with money. I was like 'bad luck, I'm here you're not', that's just the kind of craic we had. ""He was a good friend, and we'd spoken of our dreams for many years. I'd got to F1 before him but that season it was great to see him. He had this very happy face, he had that 'I got there' face."" Family tragedy . Rudolf and Margit Ratzenberger moved into their son's Salzburg flat after his death as a way of ensuring their son's memory is not forgotten. The home is littered with motorsport trophies from the junior formulae in Japan, Germany and England, pictures of their seemingly ever-smiling son on the mantelpiece. The couple have been to Imola just once since their son's death 20 years ago to see the place where he lost his life but they will return this year for a four-day memorial to their son and Senna. ""It's still heavy,"" says Rudolf in broken English, ""but this year we return. It's a celebration of his life, a memory. Yeah, it will be difficult to go back. ""It's 20 years since, 20 years of Roland living in that moment. But we live in his flat so Roland is always by us. ""But we also say goodbye to Senna, whose death was very difficult for us too, very heavy, especially when we heard he had the red flag of Austria in his car he planned to fly from the cockpit for the win for Roland. ""That's a very special moment for us amid the sadness."" Rudolf admits time has been a healer and that there is no bitterness towards the sport. ""We were just happy that he'd achieved his dream to be a driver in Formula 1,"" he added. ""It had been a long time driving in Japan, Germany and England to get there. I didn't see one of his grands prix. ""I've never wished that he didn't do Formula 1, no, because that was what he wanted to do, that was his dream. We were very happy for him, it was what he loved to do."" Ratzenberger, who was so delighted on making it to F1 he handed out pin badges with his helmet on it to supporters, is buried in the family grave with a small replica of his helmet and a picture of him on the tombstone, with the final words summing up his father's aforementioned words translating as ""he lived for his dream."" Horror crash . The couple were at home having just returned from holidaying in Mexico and were watching qualifying in bed when the tragedy struck. They watched as their son came to a halt, his head slumped to one side, part of the car's monocoque ripped aside before later footage showed his heart being pumped by the medical crews. ""I remember his head being sloped to one side and part of the monocoque was open,"" recalled Herbert. ""I remember thinking I'd just hoped he'd been knocked out. Sadly that wasn't to be. ""It was so sad as he was such a nice guy but at least he died doing what he loved doing. I know he knew the risks, we all did. ""If that had happened to me, he would have wanted the others to carry on, which we did in the end. Yes, he died too early and it was so unfair but it was something we accepted although you never thought about it."" Author and journalist Maurice Hamilton was commentating at the time of the crash for BBC Radio. ""I'd only met Roland once at the previous race weekend in Aida in the Austrian TV commentary box,"" said Hamilton. ""I was struck by his nice smile, he was very handsome. It doesn't take long to get a first impression of someone and mine was very good. ""When the crash happened, it looked bad, it was such a vicious crash. There wasn't a lot you could say at the time in commentary. ""I then went back to the press room to write it up for the Observer newspaper and it was then the announcement was made. I remember the mood was absolutely terrible. ""I'd been in the sport long enough to have experienced deaths before but it was still such a shock, the first F1 driver death for 12 years."" Herbert, Gerhard Berger, Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Karl Wendlinger were the only F1 drivers of that time to attend Ratzenberger's funeral, along with then FIA president Max Mosley. In defense of his F1 peers, Herbert says, ""no one really knew him but also people had different ways of dealing with things. ""Eddie Irvine for example decided not to go to either Ayrton or Roland's funerals. I decided it was important to pay my respects to a guy I don't think had a single enemy"". Herbert continued: ""He was almost a gentleman racer of a bygone era. In those early days, he was the driver, team boss and mechanic all in one. He deserved his break in F1 and he got it. ""It's just such a tragedy even today."" The sport paid its respects at the subsequent race in Monaco, with a Brazilian flag laid out and an Austrian flag painted in the front-row grid positions. The Simtek team, meanwhile, committed to the rest of the season with the words 'For Roland' written on the car's airbox. But whereas Senna is understandably still revered and often talked about, Ratzenberger's memory has faded over the past two decades to all but a few.","Roland Ratzenberger died in qualifying on the same tragic weekend as Ayrton Senna .

"Skype users will soon be able to conduct voice and video calls supported by a near-real time translation technology. And while it can't yet guarantee that no fine detail will be lost in translation, Microsoft's new idea for its video chat platform surely feels like something straight out of science fiction. No longer will our hopes for such a marvel be tagged to imaginary aquatic creatures -- the Babel fish from ""The Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy"" -- or improbable ""telepathic fields"", such as the one cast by Doctor Who's TARDIS to relay any alien language to its pilot in plain English. It all sounds, in fact, quite similar to what Klingons in Star Trek use to make their generally belligerent intentions quite clear: an unseen, but ever-present, ""universal translator"". ""The idea that people don't understand each other, it's going to be a thing of the past,"" Gurdeep Pall, Corporate VP of Skype, told CNN's Richard Quest. ""In the same way it's hard to imagine a world before you were able to travel to different places and quickly, whether it be in a car or a plane, we'll never think about, wow, those were the dark ages where people couldn't understand each other.

Called Skype Translator, the add-on builds on the research done for Microsoft Translator, and uses a technology called Deep Neural Networks, which yields significantly better speech recognition results than previous methods. It will be available as a Windows 8 beta app before the end of the year, but Microsoft is already showing off its English to German functionality, as you can see in the video above. It is still unclear whether the service will be free for the 300 million Skype users, or will be extended to other platforms. Microsoft is not alone in its quest for a universal translator. Google already offers translation by voice in its Google Translation service and is also working on integrating real-time translation into Android.

"(CNN) -- French soccer star Nicolas Anelka has been given a five-match ban and fined £80,000 ($130,000) by the English Football Association (FA) for making a ""quenelle"" gesture in a game last year. The West Bromwich Albion striker was charged by the FA on January 21 after making the gesture in an English Premier League match against West Ham United on December 28. The ""quenelle"" which involves pointing a straightened arm downwards while touching the shoulder of that arm with the other hand, is believed by some to be a Nazi salute in reverse and has been linked with anti-Semitism in Anelka's homeland. An Independent Regulatory Commission was asked to consider if the gesture was ""abusive and/or indecent and/or insulting and/or improper,"" and ""included a reference to ethnic origin and/or race and/or religion or belief."" Both charges were proved, said the commission, but it added it did not believe Anelka to be a racist. ""We did not find that Nicolas Anelka is an anti-Semite or that he intended to express or promote anti-Semitism by his use of the quenelle,"" the Regulatory Commission said in a statement. In addition to the ban and fine, Anelka has been ordered to undertake a ""compulsory education course,"" the FA said. The 34-year-old, who denied the charges and asked for a personal hearing, commented on Twitter after the match that the gesture was ""a dedication"" to the French comedian Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala before adding: ""I am neither racist nor anti-Semitic."" Known as Dieudonne, he has popularized the ""quenelle"" gesture in France and faces investigation by the Paris prosecutor's office for his controversial stand-up routine. During a performance, he said of a prominent Jewish journalist: ""Me, you see, when I hear Patrick Cohen speak, I think to myself: 'Gas chambers ... too bad (they no longer exist)."" Anelka has seven days to appeal the decision. The Independent Regulatory Commission stated it will reveal how it arrived at its decision ""in due course.""

"YouTube commenters are not known for keeping their opinions to themselves. Angry users of the Google-owned video site are revolting online against YouTube's new commenting system, which requires everyone to connect their current account to a Google+ account in order to leave a comment on a video. The system was announced in September and fully rolled out on Tuesday. More than 30,000 people have left comments on the original YouTube blog post announcing the switch. Most are angry complaints and, in classic YouTube form, include obscenities, fights and ASCII drawings of phalluses. There are also multiple Change.org petitions asking YouTube to revert to the old commenting system. The most popular petition has more than 50,000 supporters and it was the most active petition on the Change.org site Friday. ""Comments were the No. 1 reason why I checked my YouTube account daily. Now that desire is gone,"" says the top comment on the petition, left by someone calling themselves James Gandolfini. The biggest issue with the change is that Google+ encourages people to use their real names, and some YouTube commenters prefer being anonymous. ""Making it incredibly difficult to have a username other than my actual name, and being forced to display it to the world is also a huge problem I have with this new setup,"" said Dustin Wilson on another Change.org petition on the subject. There are a dozen petitions on the topic. Another, called ""YouTube and Google, Bring Back the Old Comment-Style System and Stop Forcing Google+ on Those That Don't Want It,"" has more than 16,000 signatures. There's even one petition asking YouTube to keep the changes, but only 10 people have supported it so far. Intriguingly, Change.org says the biggest source of traffic for these petitions is Google+. Anonymous commenters aren't the only people who are upset. The co-founder of YouTube, Jawed Karim has even chimed in after eight years of silence on the site just to comment on the change. ""why the f*** do i need a google+ account to comment on a video?"" he said in a comment on his channel. Karim uploaded the very first video to YouTube in 2005, a clip of himself at the zoo, and hasn't posted there again until now. The move to the new commenting system is part of the ongoing push by Google to make Google+ the underlying identity platform for all its products. But the overhauled system is also an attempt to pull the notoriously rough and troll-filled YouTube comments out of the gutter. In the new system, content creators will have more control when it comes to monitoring the comments on their videos. They can block certain users and make a list of banned words. There are threaded conversations and Google+ will filter and order comments so people see content relevant to their friend groups and interests. In theory, negative comments will be pushed to the bottom of threads and quality conversations will surface at the top. The biggest complaint commenters have is that Google+ strips them of anonymity. When the identity platform first rolled out, Google+ required people to use their real names, but it has since loosened those rules. When YouTube announced the Google+ integration, YouTube product manager Nundu Janakiram said users would never be forced to use their real names. When people link their accounts, they can choose to display their nickname or channel name instead of their full name. The people fighting against Google+ accounts seem to be the minority. Eighty percent of YouTube commenters had already connected to a Google+ account before the update took effect. There are no exact numbers on how many active YouTube commenters there are, but millions of comments are left throughout the site daily. Many people just don't like it when their favorite products change. Online backlash is common with any major update or redesign on a tech site. When YouTube rolled out a new channel design earlier this year, a Change.org petition asking the site to revert back to the original design got more than 30,000 supporters. ""We are utterly horrified at the new layout and I truly hope YouTube will hear the cries of the loyal users,"" read the petition. YouTube kept the new design and it seems to have been largely forgotten about. Sometimes online outrage can push a company to change. Twitter added an abuse button and Verizon rolled back online payment fees after online feedback and petitions. Games are a particularly popular target for online petitions, with users asking for and frequently getting changes to their favorite games or systems. YouTube has dealt with these types of mini-uprisingings before. YouTube is the fourth most petitioned company on Change.org, after Facebook, Walmart and Apple. In this case, the company, which is used to angry commenters, seems unlikely to revert to the old system.","Some YouTube commenters are angry with the new Google+ commenting system .

"(CNN) -- Judges at the International Criminal Court ruled Wednesday that Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir may be charged with genocide for his role in a five-year campaign of violence in western Sudan's Darfur region. Al-Bashir, who remains in office, has already been charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity. Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo had the genocide charge on his original arrest warrant for al-Bashir, but the pre-trial judges left off the charge when they approved the warrant last March. Moreno-Ocampo appealed in July, saying that the judges' standard for adding the genocide charge was too high. The appellate court agreed with Moreno-Ocampo and ruled in his favor Wednesday. The appeals judges said the pre-trial chamber had applied an ""erroneous standard of proof"" to the genocide charge. The judges said they were not ruling on whether al-Bashir should be charged with genocide -- only whether the charge could be added to the arrest warrant. They said it will be up to the pre-trial chamber to determine whether to add the charge to the warrant, which could take several weeks. The International Criminal Court at The Hague, Netherlands, is a permanent, treaty-based tribunal dealing with the most serious crimes against humanity. It is an independent court that is not part of the United Nations. It is funded primarily by nations, but also receives contributions from governments, corporations and individuals. Even if genocide is added to the arrest warrant, Moreno-Ocampo still faces a challenge in proving the charges at trial, said Mark Ellis, the executive director of the International Bar Association. ""Genocide is a much more complicated legal position to meet (than war crimes and crimes against humanity), because you have to show in proving genocide that there was a specific intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a group based on -- in this case -- ethnicity or race,"" Ellis told CNN in July. ""Obviously, the prosecutor believes he would be able to prove this intent and so he wants the opportunity to prove that in trial."" The warrant for al-Bashir was the first ever issued by the ICC for a sitting head of state. It currently includes five counts of crimes against humanity, including murder, extermination, forcible transfer, torture and rape. It also includes two charges of war crimes for intentionally directing attacks against civilians and for pillaging. Al-Bashir has traveled to several countries since the warrant was issued, even though any country that is party to the ICC has an obligation to hand him over to The Hague, the court says. He openly attended the African Union conference in Ethiopia, which ended this week. Ethiopia is not party to the ICC. Al-Bashir is the front-runner in an election scheduled to take place in April, and a genocide charge is unlikely to harm his prospects. A genocide charge could further isolate Sudan, but it could also mobilize African nations around Sudan. Leaders from several African countries have said the ICC has been unfair to Africa, and they have threatened to pull out of the court. The United Nations estimates that 300,000 people have been killed in the conflict in Darfur, and 2.5 million have been forced from their homes. Sudan denies that the death toll is that high. The violence in Darfur erupted in 2003 after rebels began an uprising against the Sudanese government. To counter the rebels, Sudanese authorities armed and cooperated with Arab militias that went from village to village in Darfur, killing, torturing and raping residents, according to the United Nations, Western governments and human rights organizations. The militias targeted civilian members of tribes from which the rebels drew strength. CNN's David McKenzie contributed to this report.","ICC judges rule Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir can be charged with genocide .

"(CNN)I couldn't quite believe my eyes when I read the initial comments from Microsoft's CEO on how women who don't ask for raises will receive ""good karma."" What? Is this 2014 or 1954? The CEO, Satya Nadella, has since tried to clarify his comments, which were ironically made at a conference in Phoenix celebrating women in computing. Nadella took to Twitter to say he was ""inarticulate"" on the topic of how women should ask for a raise. At the conference, he appeared to be saying that women who have faith that things will work out (and who don't speak up) will see pay increases in the long term during their careers. In his Twitter mea culpa, there was no talk of faith or karma. Nadella said the tech industry needs to close the gender pay gap ""so a raise is not needed because of a bias."" There are so many reasons why Nadella's initial comments are so worrisome. I've tried to boil down my anger and the outrage of other women on social media to five: . 1. Other men think this way: First, it's clear that Nadella believes that women should trust that things will work out in the long run, or he would never have said it. The question is how many other male chief executives feel the same way. I'm guessing there are some. And if they do feel this way, how motivated are they to close the gender pay gap? Do they feel like Nadella implied that income differences will work out in the end? Women make 78 cents for every dollar our male colleagues make. For several years, the number has been 77 cents to every dollar a man earns. I'm not sure ""karma"" is going to bring that gap to zero. 2. Women are already afraid to ask: I remember a story I worked on while I was at the women's website iVillage.com. We asked women how often they asked for a raise, and their responses were shocking. Only 35% of the 1,500 women surveyed said they ever asked for a raise. Fewer than one in five said they ever asked for a promotion, according to the survey. Most women are already reluctant to speak up when it comes to getting more money for their work. Comments like the ones from the Microsoft CEO aren't likely to increase their confidence to go for it. Emma Watson gives feminism new life . 3. We need more female chief executives: I'm not really into betting, but this is a wager I feel very confident I'd win. Would a female chief executive officer have ever suggested that women should trust the system and trust that they'll receive ""good karma"" if they don't ask for raises? Absolutely not. I don't think any woman, especially one who has gone on to head a Fortune 500 company, would say she ever trusted the system to get where she is. She most likely had to take on the system and speak up for herself over and over again throughout her career. So Nadella's big-time gender gaffe points to why we need more women in the C-suite. Sadly, as we reported last year, there has been no significant difference in the number of women in executive positions for four years in a row. 4. We need more women in tech: We already knew we have too few women in the tech industry, but the Microsoft chief's gaffe is another reminder. You have to wonder if he'd ever make such comments or believe them if he were surrounded by more women. According to CNN Money, Microsoft's work force is 71% male, but the male-female breakdown gets even worse when you focus on technical and leadership roles. Eighty-three percent of those positions are male, according to CNN Money, which reports that the figures are roughly in line with the male-female breakdown at Google, Facebook, Yahoo and Apple. The issue is not just one of diversity but what impacts the bottom line. The research shows that there is a positive correlation between diversity on boards and in the C-suite and a company's financial performance. 5. What message are we sending our girls?: There's been so much discussion in the past year or two about how we need to get our girls to lean in, how we need to ban the the word ""bossy,"" how we need to have them stop apologizing and feel good and confident about who they are. And then we have a chief executive officer of one of the country's top tech companies sending a message that could easily be translated into encouraging our girls to be good and not ruffle anyone's feathers, and that that's how they'll get what they want. We women know that's not how the world works. Girl's letter to sports retailer calls out gender imbalance in catalog . So I'm thinking we might need to create a new campaign, taking a page from the fabulously successful ""Run Like a Girl"" ad by Always, which called attention to how the term ""run like a girl"" became a negative when it should be a source of strength. How about a campaign titled ""Make a Gaffe Like a Man""? There are way too many men who could be included, but we'd give the starring role to the Microsoft chief at the moment. What do you think about the Microsoft CEO's initial comments that women shouldn't ask for a raise? Tell Kelly Wallace on Twitter or CNN Living on Facebook.","Microsoft CEO said women who don't ask for a raise will receive ""good karma""

"(CNN) -- Johnson and Johnson will partner with Massachusetts General Hospital to develop and market a blood test that could find a single cancer cell circulating in a person's blood, the company said Monday. Researchers hope the test will be used by oncologists as a diagnostic tool aimed at discovering as early as possible if a cancer has spread, as well as by researchers in coming up with new drug therapies. Dr. Mehmet Toner, director of the BioMicroElectroMechanical Systems Resource Center in Massachusetts General's Center for Engineering in Medicine, says while it will take at least five years before the test is on the market, it's another step toward personalized medicine and the implications for patients are significant. ""It is very big. It has the potential to turn cancer into a chronic disease, because we can monitor patients individually and respond with treatment to the genetic makeup of their cancer."" Toner says the test is like a liquid biopsy and targets almost all solid cancers -- cancers found in ""solid"" organs like the breast or prostate. The cancer cells it finds would be analyzed and their genetic makeup determined, which would be useful in monitoring patients and targeting therapies to the individual. Veridex, a Johnson and Johnson company, announced the partnership in a statement, saying it involves Ortho Biotech Oncology Research and Development, a unit of Johnson and Johnson Pharmaceutical Research and Development. ""This new technology has the potential to facilitate an easy-to-administer, noninvasive blood test that would allow us to count tumor cells, and to characterize the biology of the cells,"" said Robert McCormack, Veridex's head of technology innovation and strategy. ""Harnessing the information contained in these cells in an in-vitro clinical setting could enable tools to help select treatment and monitor how patients are responding."" Veridex launched the first commercial test using circulating tumor cell technology in 2004, the company said. It describes circulating tumor cells as cancer cells that have detached from a tumor and are found at very low levels in the bloodstream. Capturing and counting those cells can provide information to patients and doctors about prognoses with certain types of metastatic cancers, the statement said. ""The value of capturing and counting CTCs is evolving as more research data is gathered about the utility of these markers in monitoring disease progression and potentially guiding personalized cancer therapy,"" the Veridex statement said. Toner said you are likely to find just one circulating tumor cell in 5 to 10 billion blood cells. In fact, a tube of blood taken during an annual exam would only have a few CTCs. ""The challenging goal of sorting extremely rare circulating tumor cells from blood requires continuous technological, biological and clinical innovation to fully explore the utility of these precious cells in clinical oncology,"" Toner said. ""We have developed and continue to develop a broad range of technologies that are evolving what we know about cancer and cancer care."" The American Cancer Society said the new research is exciting, but it's important to remember it's just another step in the scientific process. ""Researchers have been working on this and similar technologies for some time, and others have predicted a day when we will be able to diagnose cancers before they are otherwise visible by current techniques,"" said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, the group's deputy chief medical officer. ""It is appropriate to view announcements such as the one today with enthusiasm, but recognize that we must temper that excitement with the realization that there is still much research to be done to determine the true impact of this test on the treatment of patients with cancer."" CNN's Jennifer Bixler contributed to this report.","NEW: It will be at least five years before test is on the market, doctor says .

"London, England (CNN) -- The head of the union which has called a strike of British Airways cabin crew said Sunday he was appealing to the airline's board of directors to reopen talks to prevent further stoppages as the industrial action entered its second day. Unite union chief Tony Woodley said in a letter to the 95 percent of 15,000 BA staff he represents that he wanted the board to intervene over the airline's plans for reorganization to avert a four-day strike on March 27. His call came as the union claimed heavy disruptions to services during the three-day strike which began midnight Friday, despite BA claims that a better-than-expected turnout by cabin crew had allowed them to offer a good service. ""Today, I will be appealing to British Airways at board level to take matters in hand and restart negotiations to reach an agreement which would allow the strike scheduled for next weekend to be averted and put your airline on the road to recovery,"" Woodley wrote. Advice for passengers . "" I know that is what you all want, and it is what the travelling public expect."" Unite earlier claimed success in halting British Airways services, describing Terminal 5, the BA hub at London's Heathrow Airport, as a ""ghost town."" In a statement posted on Twitter on Saturday, the Union added: ""Eighty percent crew are backing the strike -- same number who voted for it. Two thirds of BA's normal scheduled flights not flown today."" BA said it had managed to reinstate canceled flights to run more than 60 percent of its schedule on the first day of the three-day stoppage as more staff than expected showed up for work. Union rallies were continuing outside Heathrow on Sunday, but BA said it intended to maintain a 60 percent service from the airport and its other main hub at Gatwick, south of London, and was satisfied that contingency measures were working. ""The operation is working very well, in fact we're doing better than expected,"" the airline's CEO Willie Walsh said in a statement posted Saturday on its Web site. ""We're carrying all of the customers who we had promised to fly today. So I'm really pleased the contingency plans have worked, in fact they've worked better than I thought."" Are you caught up in strike? British Airways has drafted in an army of volunteers to staff flights and has leased aircraft and crew from other airlines to operated scheduled services. Passengers interviewed by CNN after taking a BA flight from London to Atlanta on Saturday said the journey had been smooth and offered praise for the level of service they received in flight. British Airways and Unite have been at odds for more than a year over changes the airline wants to make to cabin crew pay and work practices. BA says the changes will save the company more than £60 million ($90 million) a year. But Unite has said the plans, which call for longer working hours and a cut in crew staffing levels, will damage customer service and the BA brand. Walsh and Woodley met late into the night Thursday and again Friday, but failed to reach a compromise to avoid the strikes.","Union chief urges BA board of directors to prevent further strike .

"A counterfeit version of the anti-cancer drug Avastin may have been purchased and used in a number of medical facilities in the United States, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned Wednesday. The FDA sent letters to 19 medical practices known to have purchased unapproved cancer medications, according to the agency. The counterfeit version of Avastin lacks the medicine's key ingredient, bevacizumab. Roche, the pharmaceutical company that manufactures Avastin, conducted laboratory tests confirming the presence of the counterfeit version, the FDA noted. ""The counterfeit product is not safe or effective and should not be used,"" Roche member company Genentech said in a written statement.  Genentech is responsible for marketing Avastin. The unapproved cancer medications -- potentially including the counterfeit  version of Avastin -- were purchased from a foreign supplier known as Quality Specialty Products, which may also be known as Montana Health Care Solutions, according to the FDA . ""It sounds like the key issue with that ... is that the counterfeit vials don't have Genentech labels on them,"" said Donald Harvey, president of the Hematology and Oncology Pharmacists Association.  ""Pharmacists have to take a look and really investigate their supply.""","A counterfeit version of the anti-cancer drug Avastin has been discovered in the United States .

"It's no surprise that some folks fudge their ages to get on Facebook. Anna Stoehr did. But she's no preteen trying to sign up before the network's minimum age of 13. She cleared that mark more than a century ago. Now 113 and reportedly Minnesota's oldest resident, Stoehr is a lifelong fan of learning new things. With the help of a friend, she went to sign up for Facebook this month. According to CNN affiliate KARE-TV in Minneapolis-St. Paul, when she found the earliest birth year Facebook's sign-up page provides is 1905, she claimed to be a spry 99 years old. ""You betcha,"" she told the station. Stoehr, who lives in a retirement community and was born before her family had a telephone, car or electricity, has gotten more plugged in since striking up a friendship with a Verizon salesman. Joseph Ramireza was selling an iPhone to Stoehr's 85-year-old son, who started talking about his mother. Ramireza said he had to meet her. ""She's become something of a kindred spirit,"" Ramireza told KARE. He's helped her use FaceTime to video chat with friends on an iPad and has been teaching her to use email and Google search. When Facebook didn't have her birth year as an option, Ramireza helped Stoehr write a letter to CEO Mark Zuckerberg -- on a typewriter. ""I'm still here,"" she said in the letter. While Facebook might not provide turn-of-the-20th century age options, the network has publicly celebrated its oldest users in the past. In 2012, then-101-year-old Florence Detlor got a tour of Facebook's headquarters and a meeting with Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. She was believed to be the oldest Facebook user at the time, though an older user was later identified. According to her Facebook page, Stoehr now has 31 friends on the site and has activated Facebook Mobile. She turns 114 on Wednesday and celebrated with a party at her retirement community on Sunday.

"In the midst of chaos here on Earth, scientists are finding hope for life on other planets. Scientists announced Thursday the discovery of three planets that are some of the best candidates so far for habitable worlds outside our own solar system -- and they're very far away. NASA's Kepler satellite, which is keeping an eye on more than 150,000 stars in hopes of identifying Earth-like planets, found the trio. Two of the planets -- Kepler-62e and Kepler-62f -- are described in a study released Thursday in the journal Science. They are part of a five-planet system in which the candidates for life are the farthest from the host star. Their host star -- which corresponds to Earth's sun, but is smaller and cooler -- takes the name Kepler-62. The star's planets are designated by letters after the star's name. A third planet that's potentially habitable, but not included in the Science study, is called Kepler-69c. A study about it and its system is published in The Astrophysical Journal. These are the smallest planets ever found in the ""habitable zone,"" the area near a star in which a planet can theoretically hold liquid water. Kepler-69c seems less clearly in the habitable zone than the other two planets, but scientists haven't ruled it out. ""With all of these discoveries we're finding, Earth is looking less and less like a special place and more like there's Earth-like things everywhere,"" said Thomas Barclay, Kepler scientist at the Bay Area Environmental Research Institute in Sonoma, California. You won't be swimming on the planets anytime soon, though. The Kepler-62 star is 1,200 light-years away; Kepler-69 is 2,700 light-years away. A light-year, the distance that light travels in a vacuum in one year, is nearly 6 trillion miles. What are these planets like? The smaller a planet is, the more likely it's rocky and the less likely it's made of gas, said William Borucki, Kepler science principal investigator at NASA Ames Research Center. That makes Kepler-62f, thought to be 40% larger than Earth, potentially the most like our planet out of the new discoveries. It could be rocky, Borucki said, with polar caps, land mass and water as well. It goes around its star once every 267.3 days (Earth days, that is). If you were standing on Kepler-62f, the star in the sky would look bigger than our sun does, but ""the illumination level would be like walking around on Earth on a cloudy day,"" Borucki said at a press briefing. ""It drops by a factor of five."" Kepler-62e appears to be 60% larger than our planet and a little closer to its host star; this one could be a ""water world"" of mostly deep oceans, he said. It circles its star in 122.4 days. ""All these planets that we're finding are quite different than planets in our own solar system,"" Borucki said. Kepler-69c appears to orbit a star similar to Earth's sun, Barclay said. As it's estimated to be about 70% larger than Earth, it may also be a water world, with oceans thousands of kilometers deep. This planet is also exciting because it is the smallest scientists have found that orbits a sun-like star in the habitable zone. It's not likely to have a rocky surface, Barclay said. According to what little we know about it, Kepler-69c is probably significantly warmer than Earth and could be more like Venus. ""Probably, if there is life, it would be very unlike what we see on our own world,"" Barclay said. If scientists' notions of a ""habitable zone"" were applied to our own solar system, both Earth and Mars would fit the bill. But Mars doesn't have enough gravity to hold onto an atmosphere that could heat it sufficiently, said Lisa Kaltenegger, research group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany, in a press conference. Still, the Mars rover Curiosity has uncovered evidence that the Red Planet was, indeed, hospitable to life in the past. Other worlds that may have life . Borucki said the new planets are ""by far"" better candidates for life than any others we know about, but a handful of others also have been identified as potentially capable of hosting life. You may recall planet Kepler-22b, which was announced in December 2011 and also was hailed as a potential candidate for hosting life. That planet had a radius 2.4 times that of Earth and is 600 light-years away. Kepler-22b was thought to have a temperature similar to that of Earth, according to modeling by Borucki and colleagues. The planet's host star is dimmer and cooler than our sun, but the planet is also 15% closer than we are to the sun. There is also a planet called Gliese-581g, discovered in September 2010, which is thought to be even more like Earth than Kepler-22b in terms of its suitability for plants and animals. It's only 20 light-years from Earth -- a lot closer than the newly discovered planets, though there has been some controversy about its existence. In its solar system there is another planet, Gliese-581d, that is also of interest in the search for life, according to the Planetary Habitability Laboratory at the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo. The group's catalog lists a few other candidates. However, just like the other planets, we haven't seen or tested the atmospheres of any of these planets, so whether they're habitable remains theoretical. Often, when you find an example of a kind of planet, you start seeing a lot of them, said Sara Seager, professor of planetary science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She used to be part of the Kepler team but is now independent. ""Planets in the habitable zones of stars must be everywhere,"" she said. Seager called the discovery of the three planets ""a huge milestone,"" but her excitement is tempered because potentially habitable planets have been announced in the past and there's currently no way to get more details, given how far away they are. ""We'll possibly never know if these particular ones do have water oceans or signs of life,"" she said. More space news on CNN's Light Years . Identifying planets, not atmospheres . The goal of the Kepler mission wasn't to find alien lifeforms, however. The satellite is supposed to investigate Earth-sized planets around stars that resemble our sun. The Kepler telescope, launched in 2009, allows scientists to measure changes in brightness of individual stars over time; these dimming events signal that a planet is nearby. Scientists undertake sophisticated calculations to verify that such signals are planets and not passing rocks. The satellite finds planets that are very far away because it's surveying so many stars. Imagine, said Seager, that you are in Times Square and you want to see 150,000 people at once. You wouldn't be able to do it in such a way that you could see any details of the people; you'd have to get far enough away that that many people would fit into your field of view. In total, Kepler has found 122 confirmed planets and more than 2,700 planet candidates. A total of seven confirmed planets were announced Thursday -- the three in the habitable zone, and four others that are not. This isn't the only planet-finding technique. The Gliese-581 system was found with the Keck I Telescope in Hawaii, using what is called the radial velocity method. The telescope's spectrometer allows scientists to look for wobbles in the motion of a star, which happens in response to the gravity of nearby planets. It would take a different kind of mission to investigate the atmosphere of one of these distance planets to find out answers to the most-pressing questions. Is there carbon dioxide and water? Is there oxygen? ""Future NASA missions are going to focus on more nearby stars that we can look at in much more detail,"" Barclay said.

"The smell of burnt plastic leaps out at you. Acrid in the throat, omnipresent, extinguishing from the air all the other smells of city life -- because really there is none. The scenes of destruction -- the fact every street is pockmarked by two years of shelling -- you have seen in activist videos online. But the smell is something striking: it notifies you that you are on the edge of humanity. Aleppo is a dusty, pale skeleton of the city I reported from 22 months ago. Since then, it has seen too much. It has seen the world lose much of its horror at its plight and instead focus on the extremists in rebel ranks who Western officials fear may eventually turn their ire on Europe. It has seen the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad seem to edge towards collapse and then pull back from the brink with Russian and Iranian support, in the face of a divided opposition and international community. But most visibly of all, Aleppo has had the life bombed out of it. You cannot open your eyes without seeing the impact of Syria's internecine rush to oblivion. Every building is marked. It is in keeping with the contempt Assad's regime has for those who disagree with him, that the largest city has born the brunt of his crudest and most indiscriminate weapon. The ""barrel bomb"" is itself a symptom of a war so long and exhaustive, the ways of state-backed killing have by necessity become homemade and improvised, rather than precise and militarized. It is a simple device: take a barrel and fill it with explosive and any shrapnel you can find. Then fly over Aleppo, normally in helicopters, and drop the barrel when you see a populated area. This has since been refined, activists say. The bombers now drop one device and then wait 10 to 30 minutes. Then they drop another. The aim is to ensure that those who flooded in to the scene to rescue the victims are then killed, the activists say. ""You will see that when the first one lands, everyone stays in cover for 30 minutes,"" one activist told me. ""They know now a second bomb is coming."" Bustan al Quasr has borne the brunt of much of the bombing in the past weeks for a simple reason: that is where the people have moved to. Other areas were bombed previously, and those people moved to Bustan al Quasr and elsewhere, so now it is bombed. When we arrive, the locals are sifting through the remnants of last night's blast. It came at 1 a.m. -- two bombs, 10 minutes apart, killing between 6 and 7 people and injuring dozens, one man tells us. The familiarity with death means the precise number of victims isn't something people around here seek out. The bodies have been gathered, until dawn, and now locals are scavenging. This is the scene of a mass murder, but there is such a paucity of life here that blankets, pillows and other small household items are salvaged and ferried away. It isn't clear if those taking them away once owned them. The mosque nearby has been hit too, and the front again torn off another house. Men walking on the slender remainders of floors gather items from what remains of each room. The barrel bombing -- with all its random callousness -- is a tactic with a goal, it appears. The regime is moving to clear the remaining parts of Aleppo of rebels and their supporters, of all human life it seems, because human life here is opposed to them by ideology or just association. Barrel bombs are an effective way of doing that. At the same time, the regime is beginning to close a loop on the ring roads around to the north of Aleppo that would -- with the exception of one key road, still free to rebel traffic -- encircle the city entirely. Those who live there fear they will follow the same fate as the city of Homs, besieged and shelled for months and starved into submission only recently. The international aid community, worried by how real that prospect is, has been meeting urgently to prepare for that eventuality: refugees and the demand for food for the besieged. But for now, while they wait to be encircled, the killing continues. In one of the hospitals -- dark, secretive buildings, that fear attack by the regime, where antiseptic reeks from recently mopped floors -- we meet a British citizen. Syrian in origin, born in France, he has lived in London long enough to keep his accent, but he prefers not to be named. Six weeks ago, he was hit in a bomb blast, which tore the skin from his left leg. He is wincing in indescribable pain as he explains what it's like to be hit by a bomb. ""First there is a plane in the sky. We duck down, and they just hit us with a bomb,"" he said. ""I didn't feel anything. The next thing I was woken up and I could not feel my leg. Things were burning around me. They took me to a hospital and I woke up I realized I was burning. They did their best, but they could not do much. I was moving from hospital to another and the next thing I realized I had lost all the skin on my whole leg. It's unbearable. I can't sleep at night, it's unbearable."" Throughout our conversation his leg, bandaged to prevent an infection that could kill him, but hidden by the green of his surgeon's tunic, bounces up and down, purely out of fear, agony or nerves. ""We are in hell, just go outside, the city is flattened,"" he said. ""There's nothing. It's every single day. Every single day, every single hour. There's no people any more. No cats, no insects. Nothing left."" It is baffling how life is sustained in Aleppo. There are palpable changes in the past two years to what was once Syria's commercial, bustling, metropolitan hub. Women are now more frequently covered from head to toe in the hijab and many wear the niqab across their face. Our producer had an inch of her exposed hair tucked back into her scarf while she was talking to some women in a hospital -- the helpful female bystander was just trying to help a sister out. In one hospital, we met a young girl who had been hit by a sniper, but who refused to speak on camera because she and her mother-in-law knew her husband -- apparently a fighter -- would kill her for doing so. She was 13. This is not a war that has an adjusted, moderate society waiting to spring to life in the first throes of peace. Basic utilities are more and more scarce. A full drought hit recently when rebels cut off their own water when they tried to disrupt the regime's supplies. Now water rarely comes from the faucet. We see one woman who fills her plastic jugs from a hose in the street. Some shops appear open; we purchased a USB with remarkable speed. But most streets echo with the pain and fear of those who have left. Markets and bakeries resonate with unease at the regime's tactic of hitting anything that seems crowded. The last time I was here, you could see life in all its messy forms, occasionally interrupted and shattered by the bombing. Then it seemed to aim at something, clumsy and off-target as it was. Now that is clearly not the case. The randomness seems to give some people solace, in that there is just nothing they can do. Two children we spoke to briefly on a hospital bench said they were used to it; it is part of life, like school or a favorite T-shirt would normally be in childhood. The youngest are targets, and we met several very young children, some as young as 3, who were quiet, subdued, as though caught in that moment of tense, looming pressure when a storm moves in to break over your head. 22 months ago, we reported on the fate of Rena, a 4-year-old girl hit by a sniper who fired through the frosted glass of her apartment window, into the room she was sitting in, the bullet hitting her jaw and eventually lodging in her throat, killing her. It is unlikely the sniper who took her life knew who his target was. The shot was fired purely to terrify. This time we meet Mohammed. He is 5 and in a hospital. He too was hit by a sniper. He too was at home when the bullet struck. He was watching cartoons, his mother tells me. The bullet hit his stomach, exploding inside him, and causing exit wounds in his front and sides. The doctor pinches his chest skin roughly to check he is conscious. He is and raises an outstretched hand towards me and the doctor. His eyes are closed, a tear caught in the corner. His mother wails outside. ""What is wrong with his eyes,"" she cries, referring to the sniper. ""Could he not see this is my child? Why did he shoot him?"" On the outskirts of rebel areas, there is an enormous pile of trash burning constantly, infecting the air. One activist told me the plastic is burned to power oil refineries, to make money for the various rebel groups. In fighting for life, they make life unlivable. Smoke rises endlessly above Aleppo, leaving behind those who cannot leave, who must find life in its embers.

"The United States appears to have just scored a big win in Syria in taking out a key al Qaeda bomb-maker plotting to blow up American passenger jets, but it could come at significant cost because the same strikes appear to have also killed fighters belonging to two powerful jihadist rebel groups who were fighting ISIS and not previously focused on targeting the United States. U.S. officials said the strikes overnight Wednesday in Idlib province to the west of Aleppo targeted Khorasan, a group of veteran al Qaeda operatives previously based in Afghanistan and Pakistan. A U.S. defense official told CNN's Barbara Starr one strike likely killed David Drugeon, a skilled French bomb-maker in the group, while he traveled in a vehicle. U.S. strike reportedly kills key bomb-maker. Drugeon, 24, was one of the most active bomb-makers within the Khorasan group, a U.S. intelligence official told Pamela Brown, and was working on non-metallic explosive devices which the group hoped to smuggle on board Western passenger aircraft. Among the devices Khorasan were developing to try to beat airport security: bombs made out of clothing dipped in explosive solution and explosives concealed in personal electronics and printer cartridges. Drugeon was also looking to recruit and train Western operatives for attacks in Europe, according to officials. Bomb-maker's beginnings . The Pentagon said the strikes, in the vicinity of Sarmada, hit five Khorasan targets, including vehicles, buildings, and bomb-making and training areas. But reports from the ground suggest that facilities and vehicles belonging to Jabhat al Nusra and Ahrar al Sham were the ones hit overnight and that there were civilian casualties. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the strikes hit a Jabhat al Nusra vehicle in Samarda, the Jabhat al Nusra headquarters in the town of Harim -- just 14 miles from Sarmada, another Nusra building in al-Muhameen and a headquarters building belonging to Ahrar al Sham near the Bab-al Hawa border crossing with Turkey just a few miles from Samarda. Airstrikes target another Islamist group . This suggests U.S. intelligence believed Khorasan operatives were being hosted by elements belonging to the two jihadist groups. The strikes ""did not target the Nusrah Front as a whole,"" the Pentagon stated Thursday, in an apparent concession that Nusra facilities were indeed in the firing line. On September 22, Nusra fighters were also apparently killed in cruise missiles strikes in Idlib province that the United States said were targeting Khorasan. Eyewitnesses interviewed by Human Rights Watch said the strikes hit a Nusra compound near the village of Kafr Deryan, but also killed several civilians in the village. Stirring the hornets' nest . The deaths of Nusra and Ahrar al Sham fighters could create serious blow-back for the United States. Although Jabhat al Nusra is an al Qaeda affiliate and has ties to -- and some overlap of personnel with -- the Khorasan Group, its top leadership has not to date made attacking the United States and the West priority. The worry is that al Nusra could pivot away from its current focus on overthrowing the Assad regime toward plotting attacks in the West. While Khorasan has at most dozens of operatives, Nusra has thousands of fighters in its ranks, including hundreds of Western passport holders. It also operates training camps on a significant scale, controls a significant and growing swath of territory in Syria and has deep financial pockets. Nusra leader Muhammad al-Julani -- in a rare public declaration -- described the Western missile strikes as an assault on Islam, and warned the Western public: ""This is what will take the battle to the heart of your land, for the Muslims will not stand as spectators watching their sons bombed and killed in their lands, while you stay safe in your lands."" Islamist rivals in Syria find a common enemy . Ahrar al Sham, a powerful and well-funded Salafi-jihadist rebel group with widespread popularity among Syrian Sunnis, has to date kept its distance from al Qaeda and shown virtually no interest in its ambitions of global jihad. According to Charles Lister at the Brookings Doha Center, its leadership in recent months appeared to be gravitating toward more moderate positions. And Ahrar al Sham, like Jahbat al Nusra, has been involved in fierce fighting against ISIS over the last year. But Ahrar al Sham and Nusra leaders' anger over Wednesday night's strikes could see them soften their opposition to ISIS. In a Twitter message posted Thursday, Ahrar al Sham railed against the U.S.-led coalition for ""leveling to the ground"" a headquarters building and called for an immediate halt to fighting between different rebel groups in Syria. Khorasan likely still a threat . U.S. intelligence is still assessing the impact of the strikes on Khorasan. Several of the group's leaders may still be alive. U.S. intelligence agencies were almost certain that the head of the group -- Muhsin al Fadhli, a 33-year-old Kuwaiti operative who was part of Osama bin Laden's inner circle before 9/11 -- survived the September 22 cruise missile strikes. Another senior operative in Khorasan is Abdul al Charekh, a 29-year-old Saudi former internet propagandist who ran al Qaeda's finances in the tribal areas of Pakistan before decamping for Syria at some point after 2012. And the group has at least one other operative with bomb-making knowledge: Abdelrahman al Johani, a Saudi operative in his mid-40s who U.S. intelligence believes has been plotting terrorist attacks against the West from Syria since becoming one of the founding members of the Khorasan Group in mid-2013. Al Johani, who remains on Saudi Arabia's most wanted list, was part of al Qaeda's leadership council and its counterintelligence chief in the tribal areas of Pakistan before moving to Syria around 2012. Saudi counterterrorism officials believe he previously received training in explosives and toxins. According to the United Nations, before joining Khorasan, al Charekh and al Johani had senior positions with Nusra in Latakia province, with the latter being in charge of foreign fighter networks, illustrating the overlap and ties between the two groups. Technological race to keep Western planes safe . U.S. officials believe al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, has transferred bomb-making know-how to the Khorasan Group. Between 2009 and 2012, AQAP master-bombmaker Ibrahim al Asiri orchestrated three terrorist plots to bring down American aviation. In 2009, al Asiri fitted out a Nigerian AQAP recruit with an explosive underwear device containing PETN, a white, powdery, difficult-to-detect explosive, but the attempted attack failed to bring down a passenger jet landing in Detroit on Christmas Day. Al Asiri used the same explosive compound concealed in printer cartridges in a plot to blow up cargo jets headed to the United States just before the 2010 midterm elections. And according to Western counterterrorism officials, he used ETN, a closely related chemical compound, in a third plot targeting U.S. aviation with a more advanced form of the underwear device. The plot was thwarted by a Saudi-British spy in 2012 who was recruited for the suicide attack and retrieved the device. Experts tell CNN the latest generation of airport security scanners, including multi-view X-ray machines, and ""explosive trace detection"" -- which involves running a hand-held device over the surface or inside of cabin and checked luggage, ""sniffing"" the air for minute quantities of explosive -- have a good chance at detecting PETN and similar explosive compounds but offer no 100% guarantee, especially if the explosives are well-concealed and sealed. Western intelligence agencies believe al Qaeda groups such as AQAP and Khorasan are continuously trying to develop new ways to beat airport security. It is an arms race between al Qaeda bomb-makers and outfits developing explosive detection technologies that could not have higher stakes.","Official: A U.S. airstrike in Syria appears to have killed French bomb-maker David Drugeon .

"Alvin Schwartz's ""Scary Stories to Tell In the Dark"" may have been just for kids, but the movie version won't be. CBS Films has been working on an adaptation of Schwartz's notoriously terrifying short story collection, which debuted in 1981 and went on to give generations of kids plenty of sleepless nights. At first, ""Saw"" franchise writers Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan were going to pen the script, but according to Deadline, producers are said to have ""switched gears."" Now, it'll be ""Frankenweenie"" and ""Big Fish"" writer John August who will deliver the ""Scary Stories"" screenplay. With Schwartz's spin on urban legends and Stephen Gammell's unnerving illustrations, ""Scary Stories"" was ""one of the most controversial (books) throughout our entire childhood,"" August recalled on his podcast, Scriptnotes. ""It's a great anthology of all of the stories you remember being creeped out by as a kid. ... I'm not supposed to spoil how we're going to do it (as a movie), but I think it's going to be ... very interesting and innovative."" What August could reveal is that this won't exactly be kid-friendly. ""While this book is for children, the horror movie that we're making out of it I think hopefully captures how scary those books were when you were a kid but is not strictly a kids movie,"" he explained. ""In fact, you should not take certain younger kids for this movie. I can't actually take the art into the house, because if my daughter saw it, we would have nightmares. We're aiming for a PG-13 -- the same way that I loved 'Poltergeist' and 'The Ring,' movies that aren't gory, but man they can freak the bejesus out of you."" Deadline notes that August will be digging into the source material for his script, which as of yet doesn't have a director attached. Schwartz's tales were popular enough to spawn a trilogy -- soon after ""Scary Stories"" appeared in 1981, Schwartz delivered ""More Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"" as well as ""Scary Stories 3."" All told, the ""Scary Stories"" series sold 7 million copies worldwide.","Alvin Schwartz's ""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"" is being adapted .

"Guess it's a cultural thing. While a Barbie-themed restaurant opening was hailed with general delight and fanfare in Taipei earlier this year, the opening of the blonde doll's new European digs is being met with quite a different reception in Germany. Left-wing feminists are protesting the Barbie Dreamhouse Experience -- a 27,000-square-foot lifesized pink estate -- opening in Berlin on May 16. Located off the shopping district of Alexanderplatz, the Berlin Dreamhouse is meant to show off Barbie's Malibu lifestyle. The pink mansion is full of rooms showcasing how her makeup, kitchen and wardrobe are put together. In addition to viewing 350 Barbie dolls and other displays, visitors can strut a long runway, ""bake"" virtual cupcakes in a pink kitchen or eat real ones in the cafe. And, of course, shell out for dolls and products in the gift shop. Protestors from the Left Party are up in arms over the sexism and shallow materialism that they argue Barbie symbolizes. ""They present an image of cooking, primping and singing, as if it were in some way life-fulfilling,"" Socialist Alternative editor Michael Koschitzki, 27, told German newspaper Der Spiegel. ""The Barbie Dreamhouse is the expression of a conventional role model that isn't OK,"" he said. Barbie has long been a subject of controversy -- with criticisms ranging from sexism to racism to creating body image issues for girls. The Berlin movement has led to an ""Occupy Barbie Dreamhouse"" page on Facebook, which displays a cover image of a dark-haired girl saying, ""I can't stand pink!"" in German. The page currently has 1,761 likes and is updated every few hours. The group behind the Facebook page has also announced it's planning a peaceful protest for opening day. The Berlin mansion is Barbie's first Dreamhouse in Europe and will be dismantled to tour other European cities after August 25.

"A magnitude-5.1 earthquake struck the Los Angeles area Friday night, jolting nearby communities and breaking water mains in some neighborhoods. Its epicenter was in Orange County, one mile east of La Habra and four miles north of Fullerton, the U.S. Geological Survey said. Shortly after the earthquake, nearly two dozen aftershocks followed. A magnitude-4.1 shake rattled the area Saturday afternoon, centered about a mile and a quarter southeast of the Los Angeles County community of Rowland Heights, the geological agency said. After the Friday night earthquake, authorities said police and local fire departments assessed affected areas and found no damage or significant injuries. One minor injury was reported in Orange County, emergency officials said. ""Tonight's earthquake is the second in two weeks, and reminds us to be prepared,"" Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said. An hour earlier, a magnitude-3.6 tremor struck the same area, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The quakes come on the heels of  a magnitude-4.4 tremor that hit near downtown Los Angeles a week ago. It shook nearby buildings but did not cause significant damage. Southern California has experienced relatively minor tremors since 1994 when a magnitude-6.7 quake killed dozens and caused $42 billion in damage. It now stands as the second-costliest disaster in U.S. history, after Hurricane Katrina. Earthquakes with less than magnitude 5.5 don't usually cause significant damage or casualties, though results vary by region, geophysicist Paul Caruso said. Damage often depends on construction codes and types of rock that exist underground, he said. Measuring the magnitude of earthquakes .

"Google is reportedly working on a video game console that would be powered by its Android operating system, potentially putting another huge tech player in an arena dominated by Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo. Oh, and The Wall Street Journal reports Google is working on a smartwatch, too. Like almost everybody else in the industry.

"Barcelona's unbeaten run under new coach Tito Vilanova came to an unexpected halt on Wednesday as the Spanish side failed to clinch a place in the knockout stage of the European Champions League after losing 2-1 at Celtic. Lionel Messi's late goal, his 74th of 2012, proved a mere consolation as the Scottish champions celebrated a famous victory to mark 125 years of existence. The result left Barca still on top of Group G, while Celtic's hopes of reaching the last 16 were greatly improved as a first-half goal from Victor Wanyama and an 83rd-minute strike from teenage substitute Tony Watt put Neil Lennon's team in second place with two games left. Spartak Moscow dropped to the bottom of the group after losing 2-0 at Benfica, with Oscar Cardozo scoring both second-half goals for the Portuguese team. The Paraguay striker then missed a penalty, hitting the crossbar after Argentine defender Nicolas Pareja was sent off. Barcelona traveled to Parkhead as the only team from Europe's top leagues still unbeaten this season following weekend defeats for Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain, but went behind in the 21st minute when Kenyan midfielder Wanyama headed in Charlie Mulgrew's corner. The 18-year-old Watt, making his first appearance in Europe's top club competition, made it 2-0 after veteran midfielder Xavi failed to cut out a long clearance by Celtic keeper Fraser Forster. Messi netted at the start of injury time after an initial block by Forster but Barca could not repeat the last-gasp heroics of Celtic's visit to the Nou Camp last month, when Vilanova's team snatched a 2-1 victory. It was one of the biggest results in Celtic's history, behind winning the European Cup in 1967 and losing in the final three years later. ""It's right up there, one of the proudest nights in my career,"" Lennon told reporters. ""It was a monumental effort from all those players and on the anniversary of club, it's a very special occasion. ""I wanted them to do themselves justice and they've even surpassed that, they've beaten the best club in the world. ""You try to weather the storm, you know it's coming and there's not a lot you can do. Then young Tony comes on, gives us new lease of life and scores a great second goal, and he'll go down in history now."" Another unbeaten run came to an end as Barcelona's conquerors in last season's final, Chelsea, boosted hopes of reaching the last 16 after stealing a 3-2 win at home to Shakhtar Donetsk in the fourth minute of injury time. Substitute Victor Moses headed in Juan Mata's corner to avenge last month's 2-1 defeat away to the Ukrainian league leaders, who paid for defensive lapses at Stamford Bridge. The English team took the lead in the sixth minute when Spain striker Fernando Torres charged down an attempted clearance by goalkeeper Andriy Pyatov following a poor backpass by  Yaroslav Rakitskiy. Longtime Chelsea target Willian leveled in the ninth minute but fellow Brazilian midfielder Oscar gave the home team the halftime advantage with a superb long-range volley after Pyatov - racing out of his area -- headed a clearance straight into his path. Willian equalized again straight after the break with an almost carbon copy of his first goal, this time with his left foot, but Chelsea hit back again as John Obi Mikel had a goal ruled out for offside and then 21-year-old Nigeria forward Moses followed up his goal in Saturday's Premier League draw with Swansea. It left Shakhtar on top of Group E on goal difference from Chelsea, with Juventus a point adrift in third following a 4-0 win at home to Nordsjaelland. The Italian champions ended a run of nine successive draws in European competition as Claudio Marchisio, Arturo Vidal and Sebastian Giovinco scored in the first half, while second-half substitute Fabio Quagliarella headed the other against the Danish league winners. Manchester United ensured there would be no repeat of last season's embarrassment by booking a place in the last 16 with two matches to spare after a 3-1 win at Portuguese club Braga. United failed to qualify from a group including Benfica, Basel and Otelul Galati as manager Alex Ferguson paid the price for resting his big names, but this time there has been no mistake with four wins from four in Group H. Braga led through Alan's early penalty, but substitute Robin van Persie leveled before Wayne Rooney scored a penalty and a third forward, Javier Hernandez, bundled in another as United matched the late comeback in the 3-2 win at Old Trafford two weeks ago. Braga dropped to the bottom of the group after Galatasaray joined Cluj on four points with a 3-1 win in Romania. Turkey striker Burak Yilmaz scored a hat-trick to earn his club's first win of the European campaign. Bayern Munich moved top of Group H with a 6-1 hammering of Lille that ended the French club's hopes of qualification. Peru striker Claudio Pizarro scored a 16-minute first-half hat-trick as the Germans went above Valencia on goal difference, with Bastian Schweinsteiger, Arjen Robben and substitute Toni Kroos adding the others. Valencia moved up to second place with a 4-2 win at home to BATE Borisov, having led 3-0 after 51 minutes with goals from Jonas, Roberto Soldado -- who netted a penalty -- and Sofiane Feghouli. Renan Bressan and Dmitri Mozolevski replied but Feghouli's second in the 86th-minute condemned the Belorussian champions to a second successive defeat.","Last season's Champions League finalists Barcelona lose for first time in 2012-13 .

"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie lobbied for construction of the Keystone XL pipeline during a trip to Canada on Thursday, staking out a position popular with Republicans and business groups ahead of a potential 2016 bid for the White House. In a speech at the Calgary Petroleum Club, the Republican criticized President Barack Obama's administration for allowing the pipeline to languish at the State Department for six years without a decision on its approval. ""My view is that we are missing an enormous opportunity when we delay its development,"" he said of the 1,179-mile pipeline that would stretch from Canada through Texas to the Gulf of Mexico in a prepared text provided by his office. He cited the State Department's environmental study, saying it had concluded the pipeline ""would be safe,"" and pointed to 42,000 jobs that its construction would create. Many of those jobs, Christie acknowledged, would be temporary, but he said they're still needed. ""This is no way to treat a friend,"" Christie said. ""This is not about sending 'your oil' across 'our land.'  It's about maximizing the benefits of North America's natural resources for everybody, about allowing markets to function, and about contributing to the prosperity of citizens of both the United States and in Canada."" Christie's Canada trip comes on the heels of his visit to Mexico in September. The travel and the year the New Jersey Republican just spent as Republican Governors Association chairman have given him opportunities to elevate his profile and connect with key donors ahead of his decision on whether to seek the GOP's 2016 presidential nomination. The speech comes just weeks before Congress is likely to take up the Keystone pipeline again. Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has pledged a vote to authorize the project shortly after new GOP lawmakers are sworn in next month, setting up a showdown with Obama, whose administration has signaled he might veto such a bill. Christie met Thursday with Alberta Premier Jim Prentice. During his two-day trip he's also expected to meet with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and visit Toronto and Ottawa. Christie highlighted U.S.-Canada trade figures. He called on Congress to approve legislation that would fast-track approval of a new pact between Canada, the United States and 10 other Pacific Rim countries, covering a host of new issues -- including intellectual property rights and environmental and labor rules -- that weren't addressed in as much depth in the North American Free Trade Agreement. He touted the ""North American model"" of cooperation, and the ""extraordinary neighborhood that we live in"" -- with similar political systems and cultural values. But most of his remarks were focused on the Keystone pipeline. During a press conference with Prentice on Thursday, Christie said Keystone would be a ""reliable and secure source of energy from a friendly neighbor and trading partner is something that is going to be a benefit to everyone in the United States, including the people of New Jersey."" He batted away a question about whether dropping oil prices have undercut the need for the Keystone pipeline. ""You cannot make major national policy decisions based upon the oil price of the day. We know from our own experience that oil prices will fluctuate and change up and down,"" he said. ""This provides us with another foundational piece for strengthening the geopolitical position for North America.""","New Jersey Gov.

"The Internet is a vast and seemingly limitless space, but it's no match for PSY. ""Gangnam Style,"" the South Korean pop star's enduring video phenomenon from 2012, has surpassed 2,147,483,647 views on YouTube, maxing out the site's original view counter. ""We never thought a video would be watched in numbers greater than a 32-bit integer (=2,147,483,647 views), but that was before we met PSY,"" wrote Google, which owns YouTube, in a blog post this week. "" 'Gangnam Style' has been viewed so many times we have to upgrade!"" For anyone who doesn't have an advanced degree in computing, that basically means YouTube's view counter was based on a 32-bit integer, a unit of data in computer programming languages, and the number 2,147,483,647 is its maximum positive value. When programmers built YouTube nine years ago, they probably never imagined that a video on the young platform -- back when several million views was considered a smash hit -- might be watched more than 2.1 billion times. As of late Wednesday morning, ""Gangnam Style"" had breached the barrier, showing more than 2,152,512,000 views. So how is this possible? YouTube's software engineers saw the problem coming and recently updated to a 64-bit view counter across the site, Google spokesman Matt McLernon said. The view counter can now go up to 9 quintillion views (9,223,372,036,854,775,808, to be exact), which should hold PSY for a while. ""Nothing actually broke,"" McLernon said. ""There was never anything that actually went wrong. It's just people having fun with the language."" Still, it's an impressive feat for PSY's trademark horse-riding dance video, which is almost 2½ years old. Uploaded in July 2012, ""Gangnam Style"" was the first clip to hit a billion views and is the most-watched video of all time. It was even the No. 5 most-played video on YouTube this past summer, McLernon said. ""People still play this video an absurd number of times,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Will they really finally go free? The Nigerian government says that more than 200 girls abducted by Boko Haram in April are to be released as early as Monday, after it signed a ceasefire agreement with the Islamists. People around the world are hoping the girls will be set free, but there are skeptics -- and bad signs coming from Boko Haram. After the girls were kidnapped from the village of Chibok, the hashtag mantra #BringBackOurGirls kicked off an avalanches of posts. Celebrities like First Lady Michelle Obama, teen Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai, and actor Sean Penn joined in. Even Pope Francis took to Twitter to call for their release. Now, after the government made the announcement of their possible release, the hashtag has reawakened with messages of hope and anticipation. ""I am desperate for their return. I must sing a new song of joy,"" one poster wrote. Another wrote, ""I hope and pray this 189th day of the abduction of #OurGirls will be the last day we'll say #BringBackOurGirls. I fervently pray so!"" He never stopped fighting for Nigeria's missing girls . Islamists remain silent . But Boko Haram remains silent on the deal the government says it signed with the Islamists in neighboring Chad last week. Instead, the group may be letting its weapons do the talking, continuing five years of war. Over the weekend, gunmen believed to be Boko Haram fighters attacked two villages and a town, killing at least eight and kidnapping others. David Cook, who studies jihad, has doubts about the deal going through. ""It remains to be seen whether this truce will actually materialize, whether it is merely an election ploy for Nigeria's embattled president, Goodluck Jonathan, and most crucially whether it will bring about the release of numerous captives taken by Boko Haram during the past year,"" he wrote in an analysis for CNN. President needs a success . The Islamists have employed particularly bloody tactics this year, killing thousands. Boko Haram has gone after Christians, foreigners and educated people, driving them out of the country's northeast. And they have continued kidnapping. They have often sidelined Nigeria's army. And government soldiers have at times mutinied, complaining of lacking support from the government. Jonathan needs some good news going into February's polls. Analyst Richard Joseph from the Brookings Institution shares Cook's doubts. ""This is a case when we will actually need to see the girls emerging from their six-month confinement before we can truly believe,"" he wrote after the government's announcement. He fears that after so much war, the group may be disjointed and any ceasefire deals made with some members may not be heeded by others. And like ISIS, Boko Haram has ambitions for a caliphate or religious state, which would mean it has long-term ambitions to keep fighting, Cook said. But he believes that a deal could still be in Boko Haram's interest. They could use it to rest and regroup. The kidnapping lookback . On April 14, Boko Haram militants raided the village of Chibok and kidnapped an estimated 276 teenage girls from a boarding school. Officials there say some of the girls were able to escape. It is believed that the Islamist militants were able to hold on to more than 200 of them. Three weeks later, a man claiming to be a Boko Haram leader threatened to sell the girls into slavery. ""Allah says I should sell. He commands me to sell. I will sell women. I sell women,"" he said. More than a month after their abduction, the White House announced it had sent 80 U.S. troops to Chad to help search for the kidnapped schoolgirls. In spite of many promises to find and free them, the girls have remained in the terrorists' hands.","Nigeria's government said the deal to release the girls was part of a ceasefire agreement .

"New York (CNN) -- Mark Madoff, the son of convicted Ponzi-schemer Bernard Madoff, apparently killed himself while his wife was out of town and his 2-year-old son was asleep in a nearby bedroom, New York police said Saturday. Deputy New York Police Commissioner Paul Browne said Madoff's father-in-law discovered the body around 7:30 a.m. Saturday, while his grandson was sleeping in a back bedroom. Madoff was fully clothed and hanging from a ceiling pipe with a dog leash around his neck. The boy was unharmed. Prior to his death, Madoff e-mailed his wife in Florida with ""words to the effect that someone should check on his son,"" Browne said. Neither Browne nor Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly would say if Madoff had left a suicide note. But Kelly said that Madoff sent multiple e-mails to various family members ""during the morning hours"" on Saturday. The e-mails went out after after 4 a.m. Saturday, Browne said. Police investigators were at Madoff's apartment to examine the circumstances surrounding his suspected suicide. Police allowed the medical examiner to remove Madoff's remains around 12:20 p.m., about 5 hrs after he was discovered. Crime scene investigators remained on the scene Saturday afternoon. An autopsy will be conducted to determine the exact cause of death. Madoff's death occurred on the second anniversary of his father's arrest. ""Mark Madoff took his own life today,"" Madoff's attorney Martin Flumenbaum said in a statement. ""This is a terrible and unnecessary tragedy. Mark was an innocent victim of his father's monstrous crime who succumbed to two years of unrelenting pressure from false accusations and innuendo. We are all deeply saddened by this shocking turn of events."" Bernard Madoff is currently serving a 150-year prison sentence for masterminding the largest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history. Madoff bilked investors out of $50 billion by masquerading his  investment firm as legitimate when it was nothing more than a front. He used funds from new investors to send payments to his more mature investors, falsely portraying them as proceeds from investments, when they were actually stolen money. The 71-year-old Madoff pleaded guilty to the charges in 2009 and is now incarcerated at the Butner Federal Correction Complex, a medium-security prison in North Carolina. Madoff is scheduled to be released on Nov. 14, 2139. Bernard Madoff's criminal activities have spawned a tidal wave of civil actions against Mark Madoff, his mother, siblings and hundreds of other defendants, accused of profiting off the Ponzi scheme by withdrawing more money from Madoff's fund than they invested, money they presumably thought was investment income. A person familiar with the Madoffs says Mark Madoff has not been in touch with his extended family for the past two years. Irving Picard, the court-appointed trustee in charge of recovering and distributing Madoff's assets, has filed a slew of lawsuits in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan over the past week on behalf of some of Madoff's victims. One filed on December 8 named Mark Madoff -- as well as his brother Andrew and uncle Peter -- as one of several defendants in a civil lawsuit. On Saturday, Picard issued a brief statement expressing his condolences. ""This is a tragic development, and my sympathy goes out to Mark Madoff's family,"" he said. The defendants include JPMorgan Chase, HSBC, UBS, an Austrian banker, and two CPAs (and their families) who are accused of knowing about the fraud but covering it up and profiting from it. The majority of Madoff's victims did not invest directly in his firm. They invested in third-party feeder funds, and therefore don't qualify for the financial protections extended to direct investors. So far, 16,394 claims have been filed by investors who claim to have lost money. The majority of the claims -- 13,054, or nearly 80% of the total -- have been denied, because the investors were invested through feeder funds.

"People using Google to search for information about their medical problems may soon get another source of information: a real-time chat with a doctor.

While there are quality sites out there, such open-ended searches can convince people they're sicker than they really are, and more dubious sites can offer sketchy advice about how to treat the symptoms.

"(CNN) -- In the twinkle of an eye, Israel Folau has accomplished what most athletes would be happy to achieve in an entire career -- and in his case he has done it in three sports. Since bursting onto the scene in 2007, the Australian has made his considerable presence felt in not one but three oval-ball codes, weighing in with match-winning performances in Rugby League, Aussie Rules football and, most recently, Rugby Union. Still only 25, Folau is now reaching his athletic peak and keen for the second half of his career to be just as successful as the first in which he has become a try scorer par excellence. ""Everything's going to plan, the way I would have liked it,"" Folau told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""There's hopefully a long way to go in my career."" Affectionately known as ""Izzy,"" Folau was born in the Sydney suburb of Minto to parents of Tongan descent. One of six siblings, Folau recalls being encouraged to participate in sports from an early age. ""They were a very, very big part of my career growing up. I think probably all of my determination and eagerness to want to play professional sport came from my family."" Folau began his professional Rugby League career at the age of 17, scoring a record 36 tries for Melbourne Storm in his rookie season. His raw talent earned him a call-up to the national squad becoming the youngest-ever player to represent the Kangeroos -- though his record of 18 years and 194 days was recently eclipsed by Sione Mata'utia. The following year, he rubber-stamped his status as an emerging star with a further 37 tries in 39 games, this time for the Brisbane Broncos. It was incredible start by any measure, but Folau took it all in his stride. ""I probably realized when I was maybe 13 years of age that I could make a living out of playing professional sport and from that time on it was really a goal for me do that as soon as I can."" Intimidating presence . Weighing in at just over 100 kg (220 lbs) and standing 1.95 m (6'5"") tall, Folau is, like his childhood idol, former New Zealand winger Jonah Lomu, an intimidating physical presence on the pitch. A hefty frame allied to explosive turns of speed make Folau a real handful for opposition defenses. He is also incredibly agile for a big man, capable of salmon-like leaps to catch the high ball. ""I get excited when the ball goes up in the air. I try to always get up there ... I get a buzz out of it. I am always trying to work at it."" Having excelled at both club and international levels -- he scored six tries in eight appearances for the Kangeroos -- Folau inevitably attracted the attention of Rugby Union scouts. But rather than making what has become a routine switch between the 13 and 15-man codes, Folau opted to take a detour, signing for Australian Football League (AFL) side, the Greater Western Sydney Giants in 2011. ""There are different reasons why I wanted to try AFL -- some of them family reasons and others were more personal ones,"" he explains of a route taken by only a handful of Australian Rugby League players in the past. ""I wanted to challenge myself, you know, take myself out of my comfort zone."" His two seasons in AFL didn't hit the heights reached in Rugby League but, as he has admitted in previous interviews, it was extremely rewarding financially. It wasn't just his bank balance that profited though, his all-round game did too, he says. ""My time in AFL improved my kicking and, you know, I dropped a lot of weight when I was playing AFL, so I got to be a lot fitter. It has helped me a lot,"" he said. Union star . A comparatively quiet period in AFL exploded back into life when Folau signed for the Rugby Union side New South Wales Waratahs for the 2013 season. Cementing his place at fullback, Folau impressed with 20 tries in his debut season and he was drafted into the international squad to face the British and Irish Lions touring side. Folau's impact was immediate as he ran in two tries -- the second a sensational solo effort that lit up the Brisbane's Suncorp stadium -- earning him the Man of the Match award. Folau would end the year scoring a total of 10 international tries, equaling the Australian record for a season set by Lote Tuqiri in 2004. To date, he has scored 17 times in 29 appearances. Show-stopping cameos on the pitch have inevitably increased his profile off it, but Folau has remained focused, says former Australia coach, Ewen McKenzie. ""Sometimes success can get in the way and people get confused, sidetracked and distracted, but he's just a very consistent operator,"" McKenzie told The New York Times in August. ""He's difficult to contain. If you can get him in a one-on-one situation, he's going to get you a pretty good outcome. ""He's a pretty big guy, he's got good skills, and he's pretty measured off the field. He's a very quiet, humble guy who is always smiling and laughing."" After being voted Wallabies Rookie of the Year in 2013, Folau was honored again this year, winning the John Eales Medal -- an annual award given to the best Australian player of the year. Folau's talents seem to ensure that he will be singled out for some time to come, but it's being part of a team that he enjoys the most. ""It's the best thing about it. You know, you get to enjoy the ups and downs together as a team, so you ride the emotions together. For me, I really enjoy the camaraderie and the things that you form within the team."" With a World Cup in England to look forward to next year, Folau and his teammates will be aiming to win the William Webb Ellis trophy for a third time. Given the Wallabies recent run of form -- a disappointing five-match tour of Europe in November yielded just two victories -- that looks unlikely, but whatever happens Folau won't be taking his foot off the gas as he looks to continue repaying the sporting debt owed to his family. ""Coming to Australia from overseas to try and give us an opportunity to make something out of living in Australia was a huge thing for me so I wanted to probably give back a bit,"" he says. ""In a way I wanted to work hard and play at a professional level to help them out. It's always been a key part of my success and always will be to the day of my retirement.""

"Barcelona striker Lionel Messi says he wants to stay at the club until he retires on the day it was announced he again leads the nominations for the prestigious Ballon d'Or. The award anoints the world's best footballer and the Argentinean has won it the last three years in a row. Messi picked up another award on Monday -- the Golden Boot -- after his 50 goals in the Spanish league for Barca saw him crowned the highest scorer in European club soccer for the 2011/12 season. And with 73 goals to his name in 2012 already, Messi is the strong favorite to beat the likes of Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo, Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba as well as teammates Andres Iniesta and Xavi to take the top prize. After collecting the Golden Boot Messi told Barca's official website: ""I'm very thankful to Barca because they gave me a chance to realize my dream. ""My dream is to be a Barca player when I retire. The most important thing is that I continue to grow at Barca and I'd like to continue growing until the end. ""This is a group prize"" he added. ""I always say that when an individual wins something like this. That's a fact, and this one more than any. It is a prize for scoring goals, but I'd never have done it without my teammates."" Manchester United forward Wayne Rooney is the sole English representative on the list, which also includes Spain's World Cup winning captain Iker Casillas. Atletico Madrid's Colombian striker Falcao is also included, as is PSG striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Manchester City's Ivory Coast midfielder Yaya Toure. Chelsea's Champions League-winning coach Roberto Di Matteo is among ten managers vying for the World Coach of the Year title. Jose Mourinho, who led Real Madrid to the Spanish league title is on the list, as is Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini, who masterminded their first English league triumph in 44 years. Messi remains the star name on the players' list though, as his goalscoring exploits continue to strengthen his formidable record. He is closing in on Gerd Muller's record tally of 85 goals in a calendar year for Bayern Munich and West Germany in 1972. Messi needs just two more to match the 75 Pele scored for Santos and Brazil in 1959. And due to the sheer amount of times he has found the net, he has admitted he struggles to remember all his goals. ""It's easier for me to remember the important goals, not necessarily the prettiest ones,"" he said. ""I don't remember all the goals I scored last season, but I do remember the important ones in the Copa del Rey, the Club World Cup and the Super Cup."" CNN Blog: Can Falcao help Atletico Madrid reign in Spain? ""I have never focused on winning individual awards and I won't start now,"" he added. ""My challenge is to win the Liga, the Copa del Rey, and win the Champions League again, and that things continue to go well in the national team."" The full list of players nominated for the Ballon d'Or is as follows: Sergio Agüero (Manchester City and Argentina), Xabi Alonso (Real Madrid and Spain), Mario Balotelli (Manchester City and Italy), Karim Benzema (Real Madrid and France).

"(CNN) -- Standing atop a craggy, coastal outcrop on the outskirts of Reykjavik, Helgi Sveinsson checks his footing before adopting a statuesque pose reminiscent of a Nordic warrior. With chest puffed out and a javelin at his side, the 35-year-old's stance has a classical feel, but with a distinctly modern twist. In the dying light of a frigid November day in the Icelandic capital, the jagged silhouette of a carbon fiber running blade can be made out before its tip trails into the inky murk beneath. The prosthetic limb has helped Sveinsson become one of the most successful para-athletes of recent times propelling him to the top of the podium in the javelin over the last two seasons. At the 2013 world championships in Lyon, France, he took gold and repeated the feat earlier this year at the European Championships with a winning throw of 50.74 meters competing in the F42 class -- a category for athletes who have suffered amputations above the knee. ""I just love everything about the javelin,"" Sveinsson told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""It's just the feeling when you hit the sweet spot -- when you're throwing a perfect throw, there's nothing that compares to that ... it's the perfect feeling."" Like most Paralympic competitors, Sveinsson has had plenty thrown at him during his life. A talented handball player in his youth, Sveinsson looked to be heading for the professional ranks when, on the cusp of adulthood, his life took an abrupt and tragic turn. ""I was 18 years old when I started feeling little bits of pain in my leg. And then the pain got worse, and worse, and worse,"" he explains. A period of agonizing limbo involving hospital visits, tests and scans came to a horrifying conclusion with a diagnosis of bone cancer. He embarked upon a course of chemotherapy but after five months of treatment the tumor showed no signs of shrinking and the decision was made to amputate his left leg above the knee in 1999. He was 19 years old. ""I just thought to myself: 'now the professional sports dream that I have is out the window.' So I had to do something else,"" he says. Sveinsson exchanged the fast-paced action of the handball court for more gentle pursuits like golf and fishing. Understandably, given his circumstances, he lost interest in keeping fit and piled on the pounds during his 20s. But when he took a job in R&D at the Icelandic prosthetics company Ossur in 2009, it wasn't long before his competitive spark was reignited and his sporting career resumed with a flourish. Based in Reykjavik, Ossur has forged a global reputation as a leading manufacturer and developer of prosthetic knees, legs and feet. Their carbon fiber running blades were famously worn by the Paralympian Oscar Pistorius and dozens of other para-athletes around the world use their equipment today. ""Ossur has been my inspiration for the things I am doing today. To be able to be around and talk to the biggest names in Paralympic sports made me want to do it. I have a lot to thank them for,"" he said. ""To be able to run again at the level I am doing, it's just unbelievable. This is one of the best inventions ever,"" he says pointing down to his carbon fiber blade. At first, Sveinsson used it exclusively for sprinting, competing in the 100m, before also taking up the long jump, but his true calling came a little later, more by happy accident than choice. ""I was warming up for the long jump and I saw a javelin lying on the grass. So I picked it up, tried one throw and that was my thing. The old handball shoulder was back,"" he said, noting the similarity in the throwing techniques of the two sports. ""It's pretty much the same rhythm. In the javelin, you (have a) fast approach until you stop and throw and it's just the same thing in handball."" His first ever throw surpassed the European championship qualifying standard by six meters, and he currently has a personal best of 51.83 meters -- just under a meter off the world record held by Danish thrower Jakob Mathiasen. It's a distance that's well within his reach, the Icelander reckons. ""I've been doing this almost three years and I've got so much inside that I want to get out before I stop. I want to be the first amputee to throw over 60m,"" he says. At this time of year, particularly in Iceland's long, drawn out winters, it's more about knuckling down to training than record attempts with Sveinsson focusing on his technique and keeping the body strong. ""You have to train every single muscle in your body to be able to cope with what you are doing. I am amputated on the left side ... so I have to train that little bit harder to make these muscle groups a little bit stronger."" Next year promises to be another banner year with Sveinsson looking to defend his world crown in Doha, Qatar. But 2016 is already on his mind when Rio de Janeiro will host the 15th Parlympic Games. ""My future dreams are to make the grand slam -- to be world champion, European champion and Olympic champion. ""I want to be the best, always. There's nothing else that I'm thinking about. I want to be the guy that everyone wants to beat. That's my goal."" Whatever the future holds, Sveinsson hopes to continue being the living embodiment of his life motto. ""Never give up,"" he says. ""You can always do something."" Read more: Meet Vietnam's martial arts missionary .

"They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old: . Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn. At the going down of the sun and in the morning . We will remember them.   (Laurence Binyon 1869-1943) Nearly a century might have passed -- but the memory of one of the most famous football matches to have ever taken place remains as strong as ever. Some 98 years have elapsed since British and German troops on the front line emerged from their trenches on that fateful Christmas Day in 1914. While the Germans lined their trenches with decorations and sang carols, the British responded by running onto no man's land with a ball at their feet and a ""Christmas truce"" was born. The two sides, both enduring its first winter of combat, decided an impromptu football match would be one way to create some camaraderie. It is an event which is still fondly remembered today with the English Premier League's Christmas Truce Tournament bringing the story to the next generation. The present . This weekend, teams from Belgium, France, Germany and England will take part in a competition to honor those who fell in the Great War. The tournament will see some of the best players under the age of 12 compete in the Flemish town of Ypres in Belgium, one of the areas to be decimated by fighting and bloodshed. Football made its own sacrifice to the Great War where more than 8,000 officers and men from the 17th and 23rd Middlesex perished at the Somme alone. The ""Footballers Battalion"" as it was known, included players from a whole host of clubs ranging from Chelsea and West Ham to Clapton Orient, now Leyton Orient. Read: Black pioneer's battle against racism . Tottenham's Walter Tull, the first black outfield player to star in the top flight and the first black infantry officer in the British Army, also lost his life. While such facts are hard to comprehend for most adults, these 12-year-old children are given an insight into a time where evil plagued the earth and some 20 million lost their lives. The plan . The Premier League has two objectives for the project -- player development and education. ""We got a fantastic reaction from the town of Ypres and the teams that took part in the 2011 tournament,"" said Ged Roddy, Director of Youth at the Premier League. ""We are expressing our commitment to the competition by doubling it in size this year. ""By the time of the 2014 commemorations we hope that the Premier League Christmas Truce Tournament will be recognized as an established cultural event. ""The Christmas Truce Tournament brings education to life. Our work in this area has already been highlighted by Ofsted when we got our 'Outstanding' rating; they recognized that Premier League clubs encourage open minds that accept and welcome other cultures. Read: A light through addiction's 'dark days' ""An important job for the Premier League Education Department is to help clubs develop more rounded young men. ""We are using the Christmas Truce Tournament to not only foster the development of closer relationships between European clubs but develop greater understanding of the importance of shared histories."" This year, reigning champion Manchester United returns with West Bromwich Albion, while FC Schalke 04 and Borussia Moenchengladbach represent Germany. Anderlecht, Beerschot and Club Brugge provide Belgian representation with Valenciennes flying the flag for France. Poignant . For West Bromwich Albion, this tournament is rather poignant. Harold Bache, a former player at the club, died at Ypres and is commemorated on the Menin Gate along with 57,000 British and Commonwealth soldiers who were killed in the Ypres Salient of the First World War. On Friday night, West Brom's players, including a child who attends the same school as Bache studied at, will lay a wreath at the Menin Gate along with players from Manchester United, West Brom, Anderlecht and Beerschot. That will be followed on the Saturday by a dinner, which will be attended by dignitaries from the British Legion, UK Government and Ypres. And after the games have been played and the final whistle blown, perhaps these children will have learned a lesson -- and a story to tell their children one day in the future.","Premier League to hold ""Christmas Truce"" tournament in memory of Great War .

"(CNN) -- Ask anyone from the U.S. to name a famous swimmer and they will probably say Michael Phelps. But put the same question to someone in Japan and the name that trips off the tongue is Kosuke Kitajima. The 32-year-old has propelled not only himself but Japanese swimming into the spotlight in the 21st century thanks to a series of remarkable performances on the global stage, smashing records and scooping multiple world and Olympic titles. His best days in the pool may be behind him but Kitajima's focus remains forward-looking as he builds on his legacy as arguably the greatest breaststroke exponent of all time. His goal is to inspire the next generation of champions from the Far East ahead of Tokyo's 2020 hosting of the world's biggest sporting showpiece by getting them started in the pool. ""I want children to start swimming and have lots of dreams in swimming,"" Kitajima tells CNN's Human to Hero series. ""I think the best thing about swimming is that anyone from 0 years old to grandpas and grandmas can do it. So it's important to give dreams to children but I'd also like to let people know the fun of swimming."" He set up his swimming club, KITAJIMAQUATICS, in 2011 and a quick scroll through his social media accounts shows he's often personally on hand to inspire an excited audience around the prefectures. Stroke of genius . Kitajima may not possess the physical stature associated with modern swimming champions -- most pros are considerably taller and heavier than his 1.78-meter, 72.5-kg (160-pound) frame -- but that didn't stop him rising above his contemporaries. ""There haven't been many people in Asia who could compete in the world of swimming. I proved that we (Japan) can,"" he says. Kitajima burst onto the scene as a 17-year-old, serving notice of his talent with a fourth-place finish in the 100 meters breaststroke final at the Sydney Olympics in 2000. Buoyed by the experience -- ""it gave me confidence,"" he says -- Kitajima went on to take gold at the Pan Pacific Games in 2002 at the same distance before winning both the 100m and 200m breaststroke at the world championships the following year in Barcelona. His reputation for performing on the biggest stage was confirmed when he achieved the same double at the Athens Olympics in 2004. After pipping his great American rival Brendan Hansen in the 100m final, Kitajima let rip with a primal scream of joy before exclaiming ""cho kimochi ii!"" -- meaning ""I feel really good!"" -- a phrase which he is credited with popularizing in his homeland. Noises of a different kind were also audible from the U.S. camp following the race, with Hansen's teammate Aaron Peirsol accusing Kitajima of using an illegal dolphin kick. The underwater motion which takes its name from the way dolphins flick their tail up and down was banned in the breaststroke discipline at that time, although swimming's governing body FINA has since relaxed the law, allowing one dolphin kick at the start and on turns. There was, however, little controversy about Kitajima's win in the 200m a few days later, with Hansen having to settle for bronze. Duel for supremacy . The Tokyo native's rivalry with the American was one of the great swimming duels of recent times. Hansen got his revenge on Kitajima in subsequent world championships, beating the Japanese star in the 100m in both 2005 and 2007. The pair proved just as hard to separate when it came to world records, with both men treating the 100m and 200m breaststroke world record like a hot potato. In total, they broke it a total of 10 times; that particular duel finished in a dead heat with five records each. ""Every time he set a record, I wanted to break them,"" Kitajima recalls. ""It was such a happy time in my swimming career when I could compete with him."" Despite being plagued by injuries in the years following Athens, Kitajima showed he was still the man to beat when the Olympics rolled around again in 2008. In Beijing, the then 25-year-old managed to fend off Hansen and everyone else to repeat his Athens double, becoming the first man in Olympic history to successfully defend both the 100m and 200m breaststroke titles. With his fame now peaking at home, the ""Frog King,"" as he was nicknamed, upped sticks and moved to the U.S. He says relocating to California helped to prolong his career. ""I wanted to change my living environment. I didn't really miss Japan while I was in Los Angeles. I came back to Japan when I had a competition and went to LA to train. It was a good balance,"" he explains. ""I owe that I can still swim like this to the friends I met in LA and coaches who accepted me to train with them in America."" Dave Salo, the head coach at the University of Southern California who worked with Kitajima, described him as ""probably the most efficient breaststroke swimmer I have ever witnessed."" But even his superb technique couldn't propel the double, double Olympic champion to a unprecedented triple triumph at London 2012 -- a fifth place in the 100m was his best individual showing. Despite diminishing returns over the last two years, Kitajima is not thinking about retiring just yet, but now has other things competing for his attention. In September 2013, he married pop star Chisa Maekawa -- former lead singer with Japanese band Girl Next Door -- who gave birth to their daughter earlier this year. But he remains determined to carry on in the pool. ""I want to compete (and) I'd like to continue being an athlete. So as far as people give me support I want to continue,"" he says. A trip to Rio in 2016 may still be on the cards, he hopes, but an appearance at his hometown Games in Tokyo in six years' time is surely out of the question. Isn't it? ""I'm not sure whether I will be continuing my career then or not, but I hope I can (remain a part of) swimming for a long time,"" he says. Tokyo 2020 maybe a bridge too far, even for the great man, but the future looks bright for Asian swimming, he says. ""The whole of Asia is getting stronger now, not just Japan but countries such as China and Korea are doing well. ""In Japan we have very strong swimmers who won world competitions. I'm very glad that there are many of them coming out now.""

"Beijing (CNN) -- Nearly a week after calls for widespread pro-democracy protests fell flat in China, organizers are making another attempt at rallying support for the so-called ""jasmine"" demonstrations for this weekend. Efforts to organize last Sunday were deemed largely unsuccessful after casual observers and police outnumbered the few protesters that showed up for the demonstrations. On Friday, anonymous instructions on a site on Facebook, which is blocked in China, encouraged people to show up at central locations in about two-dozen major Chinese cities and ""go for a walk"" together this Sunday. Along with Facebook, Twitter and YouTube continue to be blocked, making calls for action available only to those outside mainland China or to Chinese who have access to virtual private networks with foreign IP addresses. Meanwhile, LinkedIn, one of the last social networking sites allowed in the country, was blocked in China on Friday as the government ramped up internet censorship. This time around, organizers are masking the events as ""liang hui"" -- a Mandarin term which commonly refers to meetings held each March by China's political leadership. The cleverly selected terminology is an attempt by protest organizers to circumvent censorship on popular microblogs in the lead-up to actual meetings held by the National People's Congress and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Words such as ""jasmine"" in Chinese and ""Wangfujing"" -- the famous Beijing shopping strip where Sunday's demonstrations are set to begin -- were not searchable on China's most popular microblog, Sina Weibo, on Friday. The Chinese name of U.S. Ambassador Jon Huntsman Jr. -- who showed up at last Sunday's ""jasmine"" protest in Beijing -- are also blocked. When searching the terms, users see a message that states: ""According to relevant laws and policies, search results cannot be shown."" Huntsman, wearing a black leather jacked with a patch of the American flag on his left shoulder, was captured at last week's protest in a widely viewed video posted on YouTube, in which he's called out by some in the crowd. One asks if he is ""hoping China will become chaotic?"" -- a reference to the unrest that has consumed several countries in Africa and the Middle East as protesters there demand democracy. Speaking in Mandarin, Huntsman tells them that he ""just came to have a look."" The hecklers accuse him of pretending to not know about the protest and feigning ignorance. For Sunday, organizers have posted details on the Facebook page encouraging participants to be peaceful. In the event of ""adverse treatment"" the site advised individuals to be as tolerant as possible and show a ""high level of Chinese character"" in the ""pursuit of democracy and freedom.?""","Organizers try tactics to promote pro-democracy protests .

"(CNN) -- He was dubbed the ""man without a country"" who found he was at home running in one of athletics' toughest events. Guor Mading Maker's story makes most sporting tales of triumph over adversity look like a walk in the park. Robbed of a childhood, exiled from his parents and then his country, the marathon runner was pushed to the emotional limits during his upbringing in war-ravaged Sudan. ""I was born in a war -- a civil war,"" Mading Maker told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""So there's no such thing as childhood. ""I don't really like to talk about it ... but simply, my family sent me to go and live with my uncle in northern Sudan. It took me three years to get to him."" The 30-year-old can be forgiven for not wanting to dwell on some of the horrors that Sudan's second civil war inflicted. An estimated two million lives were lost between 1983 and 2005, with 28 of his family including eight of his 10 siblings, perishing during the conflict. It was against this bloody backdrop that a nine-year-old Mading Maker set off on foot on a marathon journey north in search of safety in 1993. Journey into the unknown . He was one of Sudan's ""Lost Boys"" -- an itinerant band of around 20,000 youngsters, mostly male, who were displaced during the war. They sought refuge in cities in the north or in refugee camps in neighboring countries, but many became entangled in the conflict. Mading Maker was no exception, being made to work for a dollar a day by Sudanese soldiers as well as enduring kidnap by herdsmen. ""They were not going to let us go back ... they might go and kill us or do whatever they want with us,"" he recalled of his capture and subsequent escape alongside another boy. ""When the sun came up, we started running. And we walk, we ran, we walk, we ran."" After finally being united with his uncle, the pair sought safety across the border in Egypt before both were granted asylum by the U.S. in 2001. They settled in Concord, New Hampshire where Mading Maker was encouraged by his new gym teacher to take up running, though initially he was reluctant. ""I told him: 'You know what? Running is not my thing. I'm not going to run because I already ran in Africa so I ran for my life... so unless someone is chasing me, that's when I would take running. ""Otherwise, no way' and he was kind of 'No, you can, you can. You look like you could be a good runner.'"" Two months later, he was on the school team. ""In my junior year in high school I won ...and in my senior year in high school I won the national indoor (two-mile title). That pretty much opened the door to college."" That performance and others outdoors earned him a scholarship to Iowa State University where he cemented his status as a promising young athlete. Marathon man . While Mading Maker began making great strides in the U.S. back in his homeland things were also looking up. A peace agreement signed between north and south Sudan in January 2005 would eventually lead to full independence for South Sudan six years later. The date, July 9 2011, is etched into Mading Maker's memory -- he had recently graduated from Iowa with a degree in chemistry and was setting off for a new life in Flagstaff, Arizona. ""I put my South Sudan flag on the front of my car and pretty much drove 22 hours from Ames, Iowa to Flagstaff celebrating."" The move west also signaled a change in direction for his fledgling athletic career as he made the switch from track to tarmac. ""There were no (short-distance) races available. The only opportunity was a marathon. I got into the Twin Cities Marathon (in Minnesota)."" He was a natural, coming home in two hours 14 minutes 32 seconds -- a time that comfortably met the qualification standard for London Olympics the following year. But there was a problem. He had no country to run for -- South Sudan was not a member of International Olympic Committee (IOC) and he had yet to be granted U.S. citizenship. At the last minute, the IOC granted Mading Maker permission to compete as an independent athlete -- a first in Olympic history. There wasn't a Hollywood ending to this real-life fairytale -- he finished down in 47th place -- but as he ran around the streets of London in his black and grey IOA (Independent Olympic Athlete) kit he transmitted a powerful message to millions of disenfranchised people around the world. ""It was very important for all the refugees around the world, and others who are (feeling) hopeless about the future to (say) 'I was just like you before but here I am now with the help of people,'"" he said. ""'And with you working hard, you are going to achieve whatever you want to achieve.'"" Return to homeland . The following summer was even more momentous for Mading Maker as he returned to South Sudan to visit his parents for the first time in two decades. ""It was just overwhelming. I was very fortunate to be able to see them again. I was praying hard to find them alive,"" he said of the trip organized by the United Nations Refugee Agency in June 2013. The reunion proved equally emotional for his parents. His mother collapsed at his feet in tears while his father jigged around singing songs before telling everyone his son's running talent was down to him -- he claims to have chased and killed giraffes in his youth.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sen. Richard Lugar, the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, released a draft report Monday saying it is time to reconsider longtime U.S. economic sanctions on Cuba. ""The unilateral embargo on Cuba has failed to achieve its stated purpose,"" Sen. Richard Lugar writes in a letter. ""After 47 years ... the unilateral embargo on Cuba has failed to achieve its stated purpose of 'bringing democracy to the Cuban people,' "" Lugar, R-Indiana, wrote in a letter that accompanied the report. ""The current U.S. policy has many passionate defenders, and their criticism of the Castro regime is justified. Nevertheless, we must recognize the ineffectiveness of our current policy and deal with the Cuban regime in a way that enhances U.S. interests."" Lugar's letter preceded a 21-page draft report by the Republican members of the committee titled ""Changing Cuba Policy -- In the United States National Interest."" U.S. officials long have defended the trade embargo on Cuba -- initiated in 1962 -- as a way of pressuring the communist nation and its leaders, Fidel Castro and his brother, Raul, the country's current president, to move toward democracy. The United States also has imposed travel restrictions on Cuba, which lies 90 miles south of Florida. In October, the U.N. General Assembly passed a resolution urging the United States to end its trade embargo on Cuba -- a vote that was praised by Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque as ""a clear and direct message to the next president of the United States about the necessity to change this obsolete and cruel policy."" During his candidacy, President Obama said that he would be willing to meet with Cuba's leaders as well as the leadership of other countries that do not have diplomatic ties with the United States. A month after Obama's election, Fidel Castro penned an essay in which he said he would be open to the idea of meeting with the new U.S. leader. But the communist leader warned that Obama ""must be reminded that the carrot-and-stick theory cannot be applied in our country.""","Sen.

"NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- The nation is becoming even more diverse: More than one third of its population belongs to a minority group, and Hispanics are the fastest-growing segment. Nearly one in six residents, or 46.9 million people, are Hispanic, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The U.S. Census Bureau reported Thursday that the minority population reached an estimated 104.6 million -- or 34 percent of the nation's total population -- on July 1, 2008, compared to 31 percent when the Census was taken in 2000. Nearly one in six residents, or 46.9 million people, are Hispanic, the agency reported. Even more telling for the future: 44 percent of children younger than 18 and 47 percent of children younger than the age of five are now from minority families. The quickly expanding Latino population is having a healthy impact on the economy, according to Ken Gronbach, author of ""The Age Curve: How to Profit from the Growing Demographic Trend."" ""Latinos have saved our country,"" he said. ""They represent 14 percent of the population but 25 percent of the live births. The United States is the only western industrialized nation with a fertility rate above the 2.2 percent replacement rate."" Growth of other minority groups is also outpacing that of the majority population. Asians, the second-fastest growing group, increased 2.7 percent year-over-year to 15.5 million. The African-American population rose 1.3 percent to 41.1 million. Minority births, combined with high immigration levels, kept the nation's population growing dynamically, spurring the economy by adding to consumer demand. They will also help to prop up the real-estate market once the economy begins to recover, according to Rakesh Kochhar, associate director of the Pew Hispanic Center. During the housing boom, minorities closed much of the homeownership gap, although the bust has worked to widen that again. As it ages, the Baby Boom generation, the largest age cohort in U.S. history, will start to sell their castles as they look to downsize their empty nests. But the group that would be expected to buy those houses, Generation X, has about 9 million fewer members. ""There would be about 10 homes for every eight buyers,"" said Gronbach. ""Xers simply do not have the critical mass to make up for the boomers' footprint."" Minorities will help take up that slack. They are relatively youthful and looking to house their families. The Hispanic population, for example, posted a median age of 27.7 years in 2008. That compared to 36.8 years for the total U.S. population -- which is a year-and-a-half older than the median age in 2000. The number of 65-year-olds and older is nearing 39 million, or 12.8 percent of the population, up from 12.4 percent in 2000. The state with the oldest average residents is, not surprisingly, Florida: 17 percent of the retirement Mecca's population was 65 or older. Latinos and other minority workers contribute to keeping the Social Security system solvent, according to Monique Morrissey, an economist for the Economic Policy Institute. The undocumented workers among them often pay more into the Social Security pool than they will take out in benefits. Morrissey said estimates of deficits in the pool's finances were reduced last year when a Social Security advisory board's technical panel revised some unrealistically low assumptions it had made about Latino immigration. ""They took into account people without papers [paying into Social Security] but not accessing funds from there,"" she said. ""That's bad for workers but very good for Social Security."" The most Latino county in the nation was Los Angeles, with 4.7 million people. Latinos accounted for nearly half the population there and increased 67,000 during the 12 months ended July 1, the most of any county. The Rio Grande border county of Starr, Texas, has the highest proportion of Latino residents: 98 percent. California leads all states in the number of Latinos, with a population of 13.5 million, an increase of 313,000 in just one year. New Mexico, appropriately, has the highest percentage of Latinos: 45 percent. New York State has the greatest number of African-Americans -- 3.5 million -- while the District of Columbia and Mississippi have the highest percentages, at 56 percent and 38 percent respectively. In terms of counties, Cook County, Ill. (Chicago) leads all others with 1.4 million African Americans, while Claiborne County, Miss., had the highest percentage at 84 percent. More than 5 million Asians live in California, more than in any other state; Hawaii has the highest percentage of Asians at 54 percent. It's the only majority-Asian state in the nation. Los Angeles County is home to 12.4 million Asians, the most of any county. Honolulu, with 58 percent, had the highest proportion. More Pacific Islanders (283,000) and native Americans (739,000) lived in California than any other state.","U.S. Census Bureau says the minority population has hit an estimated 104.6 million .

"Newt Gingrich claims that it was his first wife, not Gingrich himself, who wanted their divorce in 1980, but court documents obtained by CNN appear to show otherwise. The Republican presidential candidate, now in his third marriage, has been peppered with attacks and questions about his divorce from Jackie Gingrich for the past three decades. Questions about his past -- and what that past tells voters about his personal behavior -- have re-emerged as he has returned to the political scene 13 years after he resigned as speaker of the House. A new defense that has arisen as Gingrich entered the presidential race this year is the insistence that she, not he, wanted the divorce. On the ""Answering the attacks"" page of his campaign website, Newt.org, which ""(Sets) the Record Straight: Newt's Positions on the Issues and His Record,"" the campaign discusses Gingrich's first divorce. ""It was (Jackie Gingrich) that requested the divorce, not Newt,"" the campaign website said, referring readers to an online column written by Gingrich's youngest daughter, Jackie Gingrich Cushman, last May. Cushman, 13 when her parents separated in 1980, was rebutting persistent rumors that her father served divorce papers on her mother the day after cancer surgery.  In the column, Cushman writes that papers were never served in the hospital, and that her mother did not actually have cancer. ""My mother and father were already in the process of getting a divorce, which she requested,"" Cushman wrote. After initially being told that the divorce documents were sealed, CNN on Thursday obtained the folder containing the filings in the divorce, which had been stashed away for years in a Carroll County, Georgia, court clerk's drawer. Retired clerk Kenneth Skinner told CNN his deputy took Gingrich's file out of the public records room around 1994, ""when he (Gingrich) became the center of attention,"" because Skinner feared tampering and theft. ""During these years, you had to make sure those papers were there,"" Skinner said. ""People could go in those files and get things out.  We didn't have enough security to control it."" Gingrich Court Documents: Original Divorce Complaint . Gingrich Court Documents: Motion for Contempt . Gingrich Court Documents: Petition for Alimony Modification . Current Carroll County Clerk of Court Alan Lee said he called the retired deputy clerk, who told him where to find the papers, after CNN began looking for them last week. The documents, and interviews with people close to the couple at the time, contradict the Gingrich claim about who wanted the divorce. Newt Gingrich filed a divorce complaint on July 14, 1980, in Carroll County, saying that ""the marriage of the parties is irretriebably (sic) broken."" Jackie Battley Gingrich, the congressman's wife and the mother of Jackie Gingrich Cushman, responded by asking the judge to reject her husband's filing. ""Defendant shows that she has adequate and ample grounds for divorce, but that she does not desire one at this time,"" her petition said. ""Although defendant does not admit that this marriage is irretrievably broken, defendant has been hopeful that an arrangement for temporary support of defendant and the two minor daughters of the parties could be mutually agreed upon without the intervention of this court,"" her petition said.  ""All efforts to date have been unsuccessful."" When CNN presented the information found in the divorce file to the Gingrich campaign, its spokesman stood by the contention that it was Gingrich's ex-wife who asked for the divorce in 1980. ""Carroll County Georgia court documents accurately show Newt Gingrich filed for a divorce from his wife Jackie Battley, but it was Jackie Battley who requested the divorce,"" spokesman R.C. Hammond said in an e-mail to CNN Saturday.  ""Gingrich, her husband, obtained legal counsel and filed the divorce papers initiating the legal proceedings."" ""It was the same legal proceedings that determined and set the amounts of payments Gingrich would provide to support his two daughters,"" Hammond said. Atlanta divorce lawyer Jim Peterson, who was not involved in the Gingrich proceedings, said the wife's divorce filings make it ""pretty plain"" that she did not want the divorce. ""She obviously didn't want the divorce, on the face of the pleadings,"" Peterson said. One reason a defendant in a divorce would deny it was irretrievably broken would be ""to make you stay in the marriage and put the screws to you to make it as difficult as they possibly can,"" Peterson added. Jackie Gingrich, who has rarely spoken to the media about the divorce, declined CNN's request for an interview.  A friend said that Jackie Gingrich did not want to comment out of concern for her daughters and grandchildren. In a brief interview in 1985, she told the Washington Post: ""He can say that we had been talking about it for 10 years, but the truth is that it came as a complete surprise."" Wives take lead in candidates' ads . Leonard H.  ""Kip"" Carter, a former close Gingrich friend, backed the contention that it was Newt Gingrich who wanted the divorce. ""He (Gingrich) said, 'You know and I know that she's not young enough or pretty enough to be the wife of a president,' "" Carter, who now lives in South Carolina, told CNN recently, relating the conversation he had with Gingrich the day Gingrich revealed he was filing for divorce.  Carter served as treasurer of Gingrich's first congressional campaigns. Carter, who was a fellow history professor when Gingrich taught at West Georgia College in Carrollton, said he broke off his friendship with Newt Gingrich because of the congressman's treatment of his wife during the divorce. Asked in an e-mail whether that conversation in 1980 occurred the way that Carter recounted, Gingrich spokesman Hammond did not respond. Gerald Johnson, a Georgia state legislator at the time who also was in Gingrich's Sunday school class, said it was his memory that Jackie Gingrich did not want a divorce. Johnson laughed when told the presidential campaign is now saying she requested the divorce, calling that ""surprising."" When Gingrich filed for divorce, he was already seeing a 28-year-old congressional aide, whom he married six months after his divorce was final in 1981. The second wife, Marianne Ginther Gingrich, told Esquire magazine last year that Gingrich even introduced her to his parents in the summer of 1980, the same time he filed for divorce. ""They were thrilled because they hadn't wanted Newt to marry (Jackie Battley),"" she told Esquire. Gingrich divorced Marianne Gingrich 19 years later, after an affair with a younger congressional aide whom he married soon after his divorce.  The third wife, Callista Bisek Gingrich, is now a major figure in his presidential campaign. Jackie Gingrich Cushman wrote in May that she and her older sister, Kathy Gingrich Lubbers, ""will not answer additional questions or make additional comments regarding this meaningless incident."" Both sisters are actively involved in Gingrich's campaign for the Republican nomination. The court documents obtained by CNN also shed light on the issue of the first-term congressman's record of offering support for Jackie Gingrich and the two girls during the separation and after the divorce. The same court filing in which Jackie Gingrich told the judge she did not want the divorce also accused Gingrich of failing to provide enough money for her and her two then-teenaged daughters to live on during their separation. Kathy was 17 at the time. ""Despite repeated notice to plaintiff and requests by defendant, plaintiff has failed and refused to voluntarily provide reasonable support sufficient to include payment of usual and normal living expenses, including drugs, water, sewage, garbage, gas, electric and telephone service for defendant and the minor children,"" she said in court documents.  ""As a result, many of such accounts are two or three months past due with notices of intent to cut off service and gas and electricity."" When Jackie Gingrich and her daughters moved from their other home in Fairfax, Virginia, back to their house in Carrollton, Georgia, there were ""no lights, no heat, no water, no food in the home,"" former Gingrich friend and academic colleague Carter said. Carter, who helped collect donations for the family, said Gingrich ""wouldn't give them a dime"" in the first months of the separation. ""We had a food drive at First Baptist Church,"" Carter said. ""The deacons went down and stocked her pantry."" Johnson, the former state legislator who was in Gingrich's Sunday school class, said when the church's minister asked him to donate money, he gave $100 to the fund. A judge ordered Gingrich to appear in court a week after his wife filed her complaint. The result was a ruling that he bring the utility bills up to date and begin paying his wife $700 a month in temporary support until the case was settled. Both sides reached an agreement three months later, avoiding the jury trial that Jackie Gingrich was demanding. Newt Gingrich on CNN Election Center . In 1994, Gingrich agreed to increase his alimony payments by $350 to $1,650 a month.  In exchange, Jackie Gingrich waived her right to ask for future increases if her ex-husband's income increased.  Gingrich is still paying alimony. ""When asked, Gingrich has admitted he has not led a perfect life and has at times had to go to God for forgiveness,"" Hammond said.  ""Over 30 years later, the family has long put these matters behind them."" Johnson, who later challenged Gingrich in the 1984 congressional race, said the divorce and controversy over the support payments caused a lot of negative feelings against Gingrich in his home county. ""I think the thing that bothered people most was everybody in Carrollton knew how much Jackie sacrificed to get Newt elected,"" Johnson said. CNN asked Gingrich spokesman Hammond in an e-mail about the allegation made by Jackie Gingrich in her October 1980 court filing that Gingrich was not supporting his family during this period, but the statement the campaign released did not directly address that question. Still, Johnson said there should be forgiveness and he would like to see Gingrich win the White House. ""Newt is the smartest candidate in the field this year and he would bring an intelligence to the White House that hasn't been there in quite a while,"" Johnson said.","Newt Gingrich's campaign says he divorced his first wife at her request .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Sirhan B. Sirhan, the convicted assassin of Robert F. Kennedy, will make a personal appearance before a California parole board for the first time in at least nine years on Wednesday, supported by two psychologists' reports saying he no longer poses a threat to society, his attorney said. And in what a prosecutor and Sirhan's attorney say will be an extraordinary appearance, one of the surviving shooting victims in the 1968 assassination, retired TV journalist William Weisel, is expected to tell the parole panel that he won't object to Sirhan's release if the board OKs it, Weisel told CNN. Even so, the release of Sirhan, 66, now serving a life sentence, is a long shot, with only about 10% of California's life-sentenced convicts being granted parole, said Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney David Dahle, who added he plans to oppose Sirhan's release at Wednesday's hearing. Weisel, who shared with CNN his prepared statement to the parole board, said he was hit by a stray bullet in the abdomen ""on that terrible evening"" a quarter past midnight on June 5, 1968, after Kennedy had just won the California primary in his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. Now 73, Weisel, of Healdsburg, California, was an ABC News associate producer at the time of the shooting. ""I'm advised that two reputable psychologists, one representing the state of California and the other from Harvard University, have concluded, after examining him -- Sirhan Sirhan -- that if he is granted parole, he would not be a threat to himself and others and the community at large. If this is a fact and the board is inclined to grant him parole after him being in prison for nearly 43 years, I would not be opposed to the decision,"" Weisel said in a telephone interview with CNN. Dahle declined to comment on Weisel's statement or on the psychologists' reports to the parole board, but he said Weisel's scheduled appearance would mark the first time during Sirhan's imprisonment that a surviving witness voiced no objection to his possible parole -- at least since 1970. Prior to 1970, ""there's no record of the proceedings and I don't know if anyone showed up,"" Dahle said. ""It's fairly unusual. It's not common,"" Dahle added with respect to victims attending a parole hearing and not objecting to the prisoner being released. ""We don't get many, at least in cases in Los Angeles County -- where we get victims or victims' next of kin coming to cases. It's an expensive proposition."" Wednesday will mark Sirhan's 14th parole hearing, scheduled to be held in the Pleasant Valley State Prison in Coalinga, California, which is 200 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. Members of the Kennedy family and their representatives didn't return messages or e-mails seeking a comment. Sirhan's attorney, William Pepper, an international human rights attorney and a barrister with offices in New York and London, said he and Sirhan were ""very grateful"" for Weisel's statement. Sirhan, 63, is serving a life sentence for killing Kennedy and wounding five other persons in the kitchen pantry of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles -- the hotel was later razed and a public school now occupies the site. Sirhan was convicted of first-degree murder and five counts of assault with attempt to commit murder. Four of those five surviving victims are alive, including Weisel. The others are Paul Schrade, a Kennedy family friend and former UAW Union regional leader; Ira Goldstein, a former radio journalist; and Elizabeth Y. Evans, a friend of the late Pierre Salinger. A Palestinian Christian who was born in Jerusalem and whose parents brought him and his siblings to America in the 1950s, Sirhan killed Kennedy because of statements the New York senator made about the United States sending fighter jets to aid Israel, prosecutors argued during Sirhan's 1969 trial. In 1968, Sen. Kennedy, younger brother of the assassinated U.S. President John F. Kennedy, was a leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination against Vice President Hubert Humphrey and Sen. Eugene McCarthy. Kennedy was shot only minutes after claiming victory over McCarthy in a hotel ballroom speech televised live to American households. The Kennedy shooting in the hotel's kitchen pantry only moments later was not captured by any cameras. Sirhan was the only person arrested in the shooting. Sirhan has Jordanian citizenship but never became a U.S. citizen, so if the parole board were to release him, he would be deemed an illegal immigrant and deported to Jordan, where he has extended family, his attorney said. Sirhan's younger brother, Munir, 63, continues to live in the Southern California community where the Sirhan family siblings were raised, Munir Sirhan said. Sirhan Sirhan ""has maintained a good relationship with his brother and he would love to live with this brother in Pasadena, but that's very unlikely because of his immigration status,"" Pepper said. Daniel Brown, an associate clinical professor in psychology at Harvard Medical School, has submitted a statement to the parole board after interviewing Sirhan for 60 hours over a three-year period, Pepper said. ""The report is part of a sealed file, but I can say that Sirhan does not have any violent tendency that should be regarded as a threat to the community,"" Pepper said. Brown's report ""confirms Sirhan's legitimacy of the loss of his memory,"" including in the pantry during the shooting and in moments of his life in the year prior to the Kennedy slaying, Pepper said. ""Sirhan has at various times taken responsibility (for the Robert Kennedy assassination), but the actual fact is that he doesn't remember what happened in the pantry at all. But because everyone around there told him he did it and he had a pistol and he did fire that pistol, he came to believe that he was actually guilty,"" Pepper said. Sirhan shows no sign of mental illness and has demonstrated remorse for the shootings, Pepper said. Sirhan has been ""free of any disciplinary rulings against him"" in prison, Pepper said. ""He's said no day of his life goes by where he doesn't have remorse and deep regret that this took place and the role he played in this thing,"" Pepper said. ""He's not schizophrenic or psychotic, and he has not shown any history of violence during incarceration."" Pepper said he became Sirhan's pro bono attorney in the fall of 2007 after he learned of the results of an audio analysis conducted on a sound track of the Kennedy shooting. The audio recording, made 40 feet away from the crime scene by free-lance newspaper reporter Stanislaw Pruszynski, is the only known recording of the gunshots in that June 1968 assassination. Pepper said he believes the Pruszynski recording is evidence showing that there was a second gun firing in addition to Sirhan's Iver-Johnson handgun. The tape was uncovered in 2004 by CNN's Brad Johnson, who had the recording independently examined by two audio analysts, Spence Whitehead in Atlanta, Georgia, and Philip Van Praag in Tucson, Arizona. Johnson reported on their separate findings for CNN's Backstory in June 2009. Watch Johnson's report from 2009 . But the parole board won't hear arguments on the second-gun evidence, Pepper said. Rather, the parole panel will focus on Sirhan's suitability for parole, he said. The Pruszynski recording ""clearly showed that 13 shots were fired in the pantry, and Sirhan's gun had only eight shots, so it definitely means there was a second shooter,"" Pepper said. But Weisel, joined by authorities who have dismissed the second-gun assertion, said he was convinced that Sirhan was a lone gunman. ""I've seen so many theories after 43 years. Please -- I think you can have a conspiracy in a dictatorship and some countries, but I don't think so in a democracy or our country where there is freedom of speech,"" Weisel said. However, another shooting victim sees it differently than Weisel: Schrade. He is a Kennedy friend who was shot in the forehead while standing immediately behind Robert Kennedy in the pantry. In 2008, Schrade, now 86, told CNN that he believes evidence clearly shows Sirhan was not the only person who fired shots in that assassination. ""We have proof that the second shooter was behind us and off to our right. Sirhan was off to the left and in front of us,"" Schrade told CNN anchor Adrian Finighan. Watch interview with Paul Schrade . Schrade declined to comment to CNN this week about Wednesday's scheduled parole hearing for Sirhan. In a 2006 interview on CNN's Larry King Live, Weisel recounted how Kennedy and he were shot. ""Well, I was right behind Bobby. We were following him to go downstairs and speak to another group of people. And I was going with our cameraman down to show him where to plug in. And so we followed Bobby, and the shooting started,"" Weisel said. He said after Kennedy was struck three times, he was shot once in the stomach. Dahle, the deputy district attorney, said Sirhan wasn't present at his last two parole hearings, in 2003 and 2006, which Dahle attended. Pepper said he was chairman of Kennedy's citizens campaign in Westchester County, New York, during his successful 1964 bid for the U.S. Senate, and Pepper's duties included taking Kennedy's sisters and mother to political events. He said he was also a volunteer in the successful 1960 presidential campaign of Kennedy's brother, John Kennedy. In 1999, Pepper represented the Rev. Martin Luther King's family in a wrongful death lawsuit concerning King's April 4, 1968, murder and successfully persuaded a Memphis, Tennessee, jury to find Lloyd Jowers responsible as an accomplice in the King assassination. If Sirhan is denied parole, Pepper said he would consider appealing the matter to the courts. Sirhan was initially sentenced to death, but three years later that sentence was commuted by California courts to life imprisonment plus six months to 14 years in prison, to run concurrently.","One of the surviving shooting victims will not oppose parole if the board OKs it .

Unlike some other cancers, testicular cancer typically affects young men, with an average age of diagnosis 33, according to American Cancer Society. The organization estimates that 8,820 new cases of testicular cancer will be diagnosed this year in the United States. Fortunately, it is highly treatable if discovered early. Men who have cryptorchidism, or an undescended testicle, are more at risk, along with those with a family history of the cancer. White males have the highest risk, followed by Latino, Asian-American and black men, according to the ACS.

"Mafia killings don't typically shock Italians -- as disturbing as the occasional hit may be, the tragedy usually affects only friends and families of the victims. But a coldblooded, point-blank killing this month in southern Italy has a nation grieving -- for a 3-year-old child. Nicola ""Coco"" Campolongo was shot in the head along with his grandfather, Giuseppe Iannicelli, and his grandfather's 27-year-old companion -- victims of an apparent mob hit over money. Their bodies were found January 19 in a burned-out Fiat Punto on the outskirts of Cosenza, in southern Italy's Calabria region. Iannicelli,  who was serving a drug-related sentence on house arrest, appeared to be the target of the hit. ""In all my years investigating organized crime murders, none has been as horrific as this one,"" lead prosecutor Franco Giacomantonio told CNN. ""It is unimaginable that a child can be made to pay for the crimes of his parents."" The killing even caught the attention of Pope Francis, who called Coco's death ""unprecedented."" He asked worshippers at his Sunday address to say a prayer for Coco and called on the boy's killers to repent for their crimes. Coco's 24-year-old mother, Antonia Iannicelli, didn't attend her son's funeral. She's serving a four-year jail sentence for the possession and sale of drugs. Police feared members of the powerful 'Ndrangheta crime organization -- believed to be behind the killings -- would target Iannicelli if she attended. Her two other children, ages 4 and 5, were moved to protective custody in another region of Italy. Iannicelli will be allowed to serve out the rest of her sentence on house arrest with her surviving children. The killing of such a young child has sparked debate in Italy about how to protect children growing up in the shadow of the country's crime syndicates in the impoverished south. Coco was just an infant when his mother began serving her jail sentence. On Tuesday, Francesco Talarico, head of the regional government in Calabria, wrote a letter to the president of Italy's national observatory of the rights of minors, urging the group to ""lift the veil of silence"" that often accompanies mafia crimes, and to ""seriously investigate what can be done to protect the future of at-risk children like Coco."" Coco's mother was already serving her second prison term for drug crimes tied to 'Ndrangheta -- one of the most powerful organized crime syndicates in the world, according to Francesco Forgione, head of Italy's Parliamentary anti-Mafia Commission. ""Coco's mother is the first victim of the system,"" Talarico told CNN. ""Her son had little chance to escape that life."" In the wake of Coco's killing, Interior Minister Alfano Angelino and National Police Chief Alessandro Pansa signed an emergency protocol in the child's name to ensure the protection of children's rights. ""We need  ... to make sure the protocol does not forget children who are growing up in vulnerable situations outside the law, who may be victims or witnesses to crimes. We need to make sure Coco is the last child ever killed like this,"" Pansa said. No suspects have been named in the triple homicide, but Giacomantonio believes it is likely connected to the region's drug trade.

Too preachy, I think it was more like 'don't lay that plight thing on us.' CNN: Tell me about [the catchphrase] ""dyn-o-mite!"" Walker: That thing was a John Rich deal. He was an illustrious and wonderful director/producer. John was a veteran of many things, 'The Honeymooners,' 'The Mary Tyler Moore Show.' I did it one day in rehearsal and he said, 'That's it! We've got it now,' and I said,' What have we got?' And he said, 'I want you to do that dyn-o-mite thing.' I said, 'Really?' He said, 'Yeah we're going to do that every show.' I said, 'Come on man, people are not stupid enough to buy into a guy just standing there saying dyn-o-mite.' He said, 'Yes they are.' Even though Norman Lear (creator) didn't like it, John Rich proved to be a prophet. CNN: Were you hurt by John Amos' or Esther Rolle's (negative) comments? (The pair were quoted as complaining about the direction of the show in making Walker's character the lead and what they viewed as the series' negative imagery.) Walker: No not at all. The reality is I never spoke to them. I've been on the phone with you for three minutes. That's more time than I ever spoke to them. Being a stand-up, I was mainly in the clubs. My time on the show was actually very relaxing because it got me away from my writers. I didn't have to listen to the moans and groans of my writers. I had 31 writers. Everyone had a complaint about something. CNN: You say that you're a black sheep in the black community. Walker: Some of the stuff that happened on our show, it made it look like we were, as they say, 'not black enough.' The black community kind of turned a little on us. It was kind of like Tiger Woods where they don't embrace him because he plays golf ,and it's not a black sport. CNN: So does it bother you not being accepted? Walker: No, because as you move on and do other things, you stop working in front of black crowds anyway. Bill Cosby doesn't really have a black following. I call myself the Johnny Mathis of comedy because I don't do the black thing. CNN: How do you describe yourself politically? Walker: I'm a realist independent. I'm against affirmative action because we're at a point now where some things outlive their usefulness. CNN: You're also against gay marriage. Walker: Yeah I am. There's just certain traditions that need to be upheld. I'll give you the other side of it, no it doesn't affect me, no it doesn't change my life. There's just traditions that need to be dealt with. I'm a believer that gay marriage should be passed because the battle is not worth the war. The gay lobby is very loud. I'm totally against it. In 100 years from now, people are going to go, 'Who was against gay marriage?' And I'll be one of those idiots and say, 'That's me.' I'm just against it on moral grounds, that's it. I'm as much a heathen as anybody. I just don't believe on moral grounds it should be done. I don't like it, I don't accept it. CNN: You were good friends with Jay Leno, but are no longer. Walker: I'm a fan of Jay Leno. I have nothing against him. I think he's still today one of the Top 10 comics in the country. What he has done is let us down as a comedy community by not bringing on any new acts. He's been on 30 years and hasn't broken one act. Come on! For Jay Leno not to do that, it's embarrassing, all I want for Jay Leno to do is do what was done for him, that's all. I don't hate Jay Leno, I think what he's done is bad. CNN: You have very nice things to say about David Letterman. Walker: Dave may not be a people person, but if you're his friend, you're his friend. The whole intern thing ... I said this to people, 'If you had said to me two years ago, Dave is sleeping with his intern and cheating on Regina,' I would have said, 'You gotta kill me because that ain't happening,' and I would have been dead. I never would have believed that because Dave is a very shy guy. He's never really hit on chicks. He doesn't go out with attractive women, he doesn't try to do that. If I'm David Letterman, I got me a Vogue magazine and I'm going, 'Bring this girl to me now!' CNN: You seem to be quite the ladies man. Walker: No, I'm not. You have to go through a lot to get women because they're so upset about everything, but if you get a nice woman, that is a great feeling. When you get older and the women are in their 40s and 50s they're all divorced, they've all got kids, they all hate men, so you have to listen and let them vent. You hope they have girlfriends so they can vent to their girlfriends.","Jimmie ""J.J."" Walker has written a book about his life and career .

"A nationwide shortage of a commonly used imported drug used in capital punishment has prompted 15 states on Monday to urge the U.S. Justice Department to intervene. Led by Oklahoma officials, the move comes as the 33 states with the death penalty -- all of whom use lethal injection as the primary execution method -- struggle to preserve existing stock or search for legally acceptable chemical alternatives. A federal judge in March had blocked the importation of thiopental into states like Arizona, South Carolina, and Georgia saying it was a ""misbranded drug and an unapproved drug."" Judge Richard Leon in Washington ordered state corrections departments to return suspected foreign-made thiopental to the Food and Drug Administration. The states called that a ""flawed decision"" and now want the FDA to appeal that judge's decision, saying upcoming executions are being undermined. Attorneys General Scott Pruitt in Oklahoma and Marty Jackley in South Dakota are leading the legal effort. ""At the very core of the states' police powers are their powers to enact laws to protect their citizens against violent crimes. As state attorneys general, we are tasked with enforcing those laws, including in instances where capital punishment is authorized for the most heinous of crimes,"" according to attorneys general from the 15 states. States argued the federal agency had routinely released the imported drug for executions, a practice suspended after the judge's ruling. ""If the (court) decision is not overturned, we as state attorneys general will be forced to take actions to ensure execution by lethal injection remains a viable option."" This comes after Texas officials disclosed Monday they only have enough drugs on hand for 23 more executions. The next scheduled execution in the U.S. is Bobby Hines in Texas on June 6. Missouri earlier this month announced new protocols, and will use an entirely new drug. Propofol is a surgical anesthetic that in large doses can be administered fatally, but has never been used in the U.S. to put prisoners to death. Officials in Ohio, Texas and other states last year cited a nationwide shortage of sodium thiopental in their decisions to separately use pentobarbital, a barbiturate that has alternately been used to put animals to sleep. Some states use a single execution drug, others rely on a three-drug mixture or cocktail. Pentobarbital has become the new legal flashpoint over capital punishment. It was used in a U.S. execution for the first time in December 2010, when it was administered as the first ingredient in a three-drug cocktail used in a lethal injection given to an Oklahoma inmate. It also has limited Food and Drug Administration approval in smaller doses for humans as a mild anesthetic and to treat some seizures. Many physicians say they no longer administer it to people for medical purposes. The second drug in the three-drug cocktail -- pancuronium bromide -- paralyzes all  muscle movement. The third drug, potassium chloride, induces cardiac arrest and  death. In 2009, Ohio became the first state to perform an execution with a single drug, using a higher  concentration of sodium thiopental. There were no reported complications and its use encouraged other states to follow suit. The nation's only manufacturer of sodium thiopental since announced it was stopping  production. Many capital punishment opponents claim sodium thiopental, which renders the prisoner  unconscious, can wear off too quickly, and that some prisoners would actually be  awake and able to feel pain as the procedure  continued. The European manufacturers of both pentobarbital and sodium  thiopental have opposed using their products for executions in the  United  States. Pentobarbital is widely available and has been used for  physician-assisted suicide, including in Oregon, where the practice is legal in limited  circumstances. Nationwide, death penalty use continues to decline. Connecticut recently became the latest state to ban capital punishment, although the 11 people on death row will remain there. Only 43 people were executed in the U.S. in 2011, down three from the previous year, and a 56% decline from 13 years ago, when nearly 100 people were put to death. Eighteen have been executed so far in 2012.","There is nationwide shortage of lethal injection drugs .

"""I don't know if organized criminals have the capability to do something to the Pope. But they are certainly thinking about it."" These words, uttered in a recent interview by an Italian anti-Mafia prosecutor, don't quite justify the alarming worldwide headlines they provoked, but at the same time it would be rash to dismiss them out of hand. The new Pope represents a serious threat to some established criminal interests at a critical moment in the long history of the Mafias' relationship with Catholicism -- a past marked by both intimacy and violence. Read more: Prosecutor says Pope faces mafia threat . Italy's Mafia problem is as old as the Italian state. The three major Mafias -- the Camorra, the 'Ndrangheta, and Cosa Nostra -- originated in the political violence that led up to Italian unification in 1860. But only in 1993 did a Pope explicitly denounce the Mafia. Speaking in Sicily, John Paul II warned mobsters that God's judgement was at hand. Cosa Nostra's own verdict on the Pope's words came two months later, when it planted bombs that seriously damaged two ancient churches in Rome. Before that epoch-making rupture, mafiosi and priests had rubbed along pretty well. The reasons were political. The Church loathed the new Italian state because its unification had robbed the Pontiff of his earthly kingdom, leaving him only with the Vatican City. So the Church looked elsewhere for pious sources of authority. And Mafia bosses have always been good at dressing up as devout paladins of order. The local saint's day, when a statue is carried through the streets amid prayers and singing, is the focal point of the calendar in many Italian towns and villages. All too often, the local capo would place himself at the head of the parade. The 'Ndrangheta even used a religious festival as cover for its annual general meeting. Since the 1890s, the bosses from across Calabria have gathered in early September at the Festival of the Madonna of Polsi. During the Cold War, the Church stood firmly in the anti-communist camp. Mafia bosses had every interest in posing as bulwarks against the red menace because it helped them cosy up to the Christian Democrats -- the Catholic political party that held power until 1994. In 1964, the Cardinal Archbishop of Palermo denounced any talk of the Mafia as a Communist plot to besmirch Sicily. In 1982, John Paul II visited Palermo in the middle of an underworld war that saw hundreds killed, and he did not once use the M-word. Read more: Popular Pope but same old church? So the Church was, at best, culpably silent about Italy's permanent Mafia emergency. Over that time, mafiosi learned to speak religious language and twist it to their own ends. The evidence is overwhelming: most Italian gangsters are believers. During the making of a recent documentary for Italian television, I visited many of the fortified bunkers that 'Ndrangheta bosses have built in case they need to go to ground. Not one was without its crucifixes, its statuettes of saints, its paintings of the Virgin Mary. I accompanied the carabinieri (military police) on a raid on a boss's villa that had been modelled on the house from the final scene of the movie Scarface. Not only was there a large effigy of the Madonna of Polsi outside the front door, but the interior was decorated with various religious trinkets that competed for space with samurai swords and replica machine guns. Religion offers the Mafias a way to bind their organizations together, and gives them the feeling that they are extorting and killing in the name of a cause more noble than their own greed. The piety of the majority of Mafia affiliates is the ultimate proof of the truism that religion can be used to justify any cause. So what changed? Why did John Paul II make his famous denunciation of the Mafia in 1993? There are two fundamental reasons. First, the end of the Cold War. And second, in 1992, the clamorous bombing assassinations of Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, Italy's two leading antiMafia prosecutors. Since then, the Vatican has entrenched its stance against the mob. An important symbolic gesture came earlier this year, when Father Pino Puglisi, a Palermo priest murdered by Cosa Nostra in 1993, was beatified. Read more: Pope's embrace of disfigured man goes viral . Much remains to be done before the Catholic Church in its entirety can be said to have distanced itself from the Mafia. Priests are not always keen to dance to the new tune issuing from St Peter's. Some still preside over the lavish weddings that weld underworld dynasties together. Religious festivals are still subject to Mafia infiltration. Pope Francis is determined that there will be no turning back. He used the beatification of Father Pino Puglisi as his cue to repeat John Paul II's denunciation of the Mafia from twenty years back. But the new Pope is also taking the battle against crime beyond the realm of words and symbols. The decisive terrain on which that battle will be fought is finance. The Church is rich. But its finances are also bafflingly complex and utterly lacking in transparency. At the centre of its archipelago of financial institutions sits the Institute for the Works of Religion (or IOR) -- the Vatican Bank. It handles the money of many religious orders. But it also acts like a little piece of the Caymen Islands on the western side of the Tiber River, which is what makes it attractive to people who want to keep their wealth away from the prying eyes of the law. The IOR has been tainted with scandal before. In 1982 it was implicated in the fraudulent bankruptcy of the Banco Ambrosiano, whose president, Roberto ""God's banker"" Calvi, was found hanging under Blackfriars Bridge in London. Although his murder, or suicide, is still unsolved, it seems highly likely that he was laundering Cosa Nostra's heroin profits. Most observers think that the Church's efforts to reform its finances in the wake of the Calvi scandal were desultory. Little changed. But now Pope Francis has hired external expertise to bring the IOR into line with international standards of transparency and probity. Just a few days ago he was particularly frank in condemning Italians who worship ""the goddess bribe"", and who give to charity while dodging tax. Nobody knows how far the rot extends. Many suspect that the Mafias and sundry other shady cabals have for years been concealing money under the noses of bishops and cardinals. If Francis is really determined to carry through his clean-up, then likely as not there are plenty of people who would wish him harm. So would the Mafia really murder the Pope? It is very unlikely. The Mafias rarely kill without first carrying out a cost-benefit analysis. Even a rudimentary projection of the likely consequences of a hit on the head of the Catholic Church would show it to be a catastrophic own goal. A much more probable scenario is that the Church will carry on reforming its finances, but at its habitual leaden-footed pace. Meanwhile, the dirty money will be spirited away.","Italian anti-mob prosecutor says Pope faces threat from the mafia .

"(CNN) -- As the boat slowly approaches the quiet shores of Bunce Island, it's hard to shake off the eerie feeling of being transported back into one of history's darkest chapters. Located some 30 kilometers from Freetown, this tiny strip of land in the Sierra Leone river served as a major post for the transatlantic slave trade in the 18th century. For tens of thousands of Africans, this was the place where their life in the continent ended -- men, women and children were kidnapped and brought to the island's fort to be traded and eventually put on slave ships bound for the Americas. ""The African-American story is very much here,"" says Joseph Opala, director of the Bunce Island Coalition, a group of historians and archaeologists working together to turn the island into a national landmark that can be appreciated for its historical value. Upon arriving in the American colonies, West African slaves were forced to work in rice paddies, cotton fields and indigo plantations along the South Carolina-Georgia seaboard where the moist climate and fertile land were very similar to their African homelands. Read this: African slave traditions live on in U.S. ""There are 40 big castles like this along the West African coast, but this is the only one that sent appreciable numbers of captives to what is now the U.S.,"" says Opala. 'The place where history sleeps' Stepping onto the uninhabited island, you quickly realize that this is a place forgotten by time, its ancient structures gradually decayed by the two centuries of tropical rain seeping down. Unlike other slaving trading posts, nothing was ever built on the island after its abandonment in the mid-1800s. Its crumbling ruins, blanketed by overgrown weeds and ivy roots, remain relatively untouched to this day, serving as a reminder of the island's dark past. ""One Sierra Leonean years ago used to refer to Bunce Island as the place where history sleeps,"" says Opala. ""And there's no better description of it -- it's a kind of slave trade ghost town."" Read this: Tracing the slaves who shaped America . Opala says that to this day, many people in Sierra Leone are not aware of Bunce Island's grim place in history. He says that the island receives just a small number of people each year, mainly foreign visitors or expatriates. ""For tourists, it means renting a boat for 500, 600, $700, or there are tourist services oriented toward tourists that will take you for $60-70,"" says Opala. ""But for local people, it's absolutely not affordable. But at the same time, there's not a lot of local interest yet in going there because people still don't know much about it."" To change that, and remind both tourists and locals about its importance, the Bunce Island Coalition has launched a $5 million project to conserve what's left of the island. The group also wants to build a museum in Freetown as part of efforts to shed light on the island's dark past. ""There's an awakening now out here by the political elite and many ordinary citizens that this place is not just important for history,"" says Opala. ""But it also can serve as a source of revenue for the country, and can strengthen the links between African-Americans and Sierra Leoneans which may in the end be the most important outcome of this, because that can last forever.""

"(CNN) -- Bashar al-Assad wasn't supposed to rule Syria. He grew up in the shadow of his father, the late President Hafez al-Assad, and his older brother, who was groomed to be the next president. But the deaths of his father and brother thrust a young Bashar al-Assad into power. Now, a bloody crackdown by his regime on pro-reform demonstrators is defining his rule. Reports of deaths across the country trickle in almost every day. The government has maintained the same narrative: It is targeting armed terrorists. But opposition activists say it is a systematic, sustained slaughter on civilians by the al-Assad regime. And the United States is moving toward calling for al-Assad to step down, government sources said. Politics weren't in al-Assad's original career path. He studied medicine in Britain, receiving a degree in ophthalmology, and headed the Syrian Computer Society. ""Dr. Bashar,"" as he was widely known, liked to windsurf and play volleyball. But he switched his focus to military science after his older brother, Bassel, died in a 1994 car accident. When his father died in June 2000, it only took hours for the Syrian parliament to vote to amend the country's constitution to allow al-Assad to become president. The parliament lowered the age of eligibility of the president from 40 to 34, allowing the son to take over. Within weeks, al-Assad was also made a member of the regional command for the ruling Baath Party, another requirement of succession. In the beginning, al-Assad was viewed by some as a fresh, youthful leader who might usher in a more progressive, more moderate regime. But more than a decade into his rule, amateur videos of violent protests and bloodied bodies paint a gruesome picture of the conflict in Syria. Human rights groups say such scenes are evidence of Syrian security forces firing on their own people, though state-run media disputes such claims. Initially, protesters wanted basic reforms, more freedoms, a multiparty political system and an end to emergency law. Some of these reforms have, on paper, been implemented by al-Assad, but they were far too little and, by the time they came about, too late. Syrians have lived in fear of political repression for decades. Hafez al-Assad ruled with an iron fist for three decades, ruthlessly putting down dissent by jailing dissidents and crushing the opposition. For more than 47 years, the country had been under emergency law, which effectively suspended most constitutional protections, according to the U.S. State Department. The law authorized the government to conduct preventive and arbitrary arrests, according to the British Foreign Office. Security forces didn't need to obtain arrest warrants, and suspects were detained for prolonged periods without charge, trial or access to lawyers. Amid the conflict in recent months, al-Assad lifted the state of emergency and abolished a court set up to try people posing a threat to the regime. But at the same time, arbitrary detentions have continued, as has the use of force against demonstrators. Al-Assad, now 45, denies he is a dictator, seeing himself instead as a modern leader. His official website says he has built free-trade zones, licensed more private newspapers and private universities, and fought government waste and corruption. He has also worked on social and economic reform. While there have been some changes during his rule, many say al-Assad's promises have largely not been delivered. Human Rights Watch has called his time as president ""the wasted decade"" with a media that remains state-controlled, a monitored and censored Internet and prisons still filled with dissidents. Activists say that with the current protests, however, al-Assad can no longer look away. ""He has to start listening,"" said Wissam Tarif, executive director of the human rights group Insan. ""It's the time to start listening and acting. He can't afford any more promises."" Other analysts say force may have worked in the past to quell dissent, but not this time. ""The government is going to try to continue to use the tactics that it has for a very long time, which is just to snuff out any protest,"" said Anne-Marie Slaughter, a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton University. Now, however, ""the wall of fear is coming down."" The late president was a cautious, slow-moving tactician, and while his son's style may appear modern, he was still schooled in the old Assad family way. In 1982, the Syrian military -- acting under orders from Assad's father -- brutally crushed an uprising in the western city of Hama. Estimates of the number of casualties vary from 3,000 to 40,000. In early August, scores were once again reportedly killed when tanks rolled into the city, which has been a center of the anti-government movement roiling the country. Many activists are already comparing the havoc now in Hama to the massacre there in 1982 -- but say it is happening in slow motion rather than in a single, devastating strike. CNN's Arwa Damon and Stan Grant contributed to this report.","Bashar al-Assad has ruled Syria since 2000 .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush and his top aides publicly made 935 false statements about the security risk posed by Iraq in the two years following September 11, 2001, according to a study released Tuesday by two nonprofit journalism groups. President Bush addresses the nation as the Iraq war begins in March 2003. ""In short, the Bush administration led the nation to war on the basis of erroneous information that it methodically propagated and that culminated in military action against Iraq on March 19, 2003,"" reads an overview of the examination, conducted by the Center for Public Integrity and its affiliated group, the Fund for Independence in Journalism. According to the study, Bush and seven top officials -- including Vice President Dick Cheney, former Secretary of State Colin Powell and then-National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice -- made 935 false statements about Iraq during those two years. The study was based on a searchable database compiled of primary sources, such as official government transcripts and speeches, and secondary sources -- mainly quotes from major media organizations.  See CNN viewers' reactions to the study » . The study says Bush made 232 false statements about Iraq and former leader Saddam Hussein's possessing weapons of mass destruction, and 28 false statements about Iraq's links to al Qaeda. Bush has consistently asserted that at the time he and other officials made the statements, the intelligence community of the U.S. and several other nations, including Britain, believed Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. Responding to the study Wednesday, White House spokesman Scott Stanzel did not speak directly to the ""false claims"" characterization. But he said the United States was part of a broad coalition of nations that took part in the Iraq invasion and that the invasion was based on intelligence from multiple countries. He called Hussein a threat to international security and a sponsor of terrorism, and said the world is better off without him. White House press secretary Dana Perino called the study ""flawed."" ""They only looked at members of the administration, rather than looking at members of Congress or people around the world,"" she said. ""Because as you'll remember, we were part of a broad coalition of countries that deposed a dictator based on a collective understanding of the intelligence."" ""And the other thing that that study fails to do is to say that after realizing that there was no WMD, as we thought as a collective body that there was, that this White House, the President set about to make reforms in the intelligence community to make sure that it doesn't happen again."" Bush has repeatedly said that despite the intelligence flaws, removing Hussein from power was the right thing to do. The study, released Tuesday, says Powell had the second-highest number of false statements, with 244 about weapons and 10 about Iraq and al Qaeda. Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Press Secretary Ari Fleischer each made 109 false statements, it says. Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz made 85, Rice made 56, Cheney made 48 and Scott McLellan, also a press secretary, made 14, the study says. ""It is now beyond dispute that Iraq did not possess any weapons of mass destruction or have meaningful ties to al Qaeda,"" the report reads, citing multiple government reports, including those by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the 9/11 Commission and the multinational Iraq Survey Group, which reported that Hussein had suspended Iraq's nuclear program in 1991 and made little effort to revive it. The overview of the study also calls the media to task, saying most media outlets didn't do enough to investigate the claims. ""Some journalists -- indeed, even some entire news organizations -- have since acknowledged that their coverage during those prewar months was far too deferential and uncritical,"" the report reads. ""These mea culpas notwithstanding, much of the wall-to-wall media coverage provided additional, 'independent' validation of the Bush administration's false statements about Iraq.""
