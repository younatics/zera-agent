"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:55 PM on 19th January 2012 . President Obama rejected TransCanada's plan to build the Canada to Texas Keystone XL crude oil pipeline, saying he’s denying the application because a GOP-mandated deadline didn’t allow time for a full review. Mr Obama says his decision isn't a judgment on the merits of the proposed $7billion pipeline. Rather, he's citing the 'arbitrary nature' of the February  21 deadline that was set by a GOP-written provision in a recent tax bill that Mr Obama signed. Against it: Demonstrators carried a giant mock pipeline while calling for the cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline during a rally in Washington November 6 of last year . The president said in a statement that he's disappointed that Republicans in Congress forced the decision. Mr Obama had until late next month to decide whether the pipeline was in the national interest. Administration officials says the looming deadline cut short the time needed to conduct environmental reviews after the State Department ordered the project developer to find an alternate route to avoid environmentally sensitive areas of Nebraska. All roads lead to Texas: The route of the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline which is opposed by environmentalist groups goes through delicate areas of Nebraska . Pipes in waiting: Pipes are laid out and waiting to be installed in North Dakota . The $7billion pipeline would run through . six states and carry oil from Canada to Texas Gulf Coast refineries, . passing through an environmentally sensitive area of Nebraska. According to a source close to the matter: 'The time provided in the Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act is not adequate for the Department to gain the additional information needed.' ‘The Department's recommendation of denial of the ... permit at this time is based on not having the necessary information. Man your battle stations: Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner and other GOP leaders are expected to challenge Mr Obama's ruling . 'It does not preclude any subsequent permit application of application for similar project,’ the source told Reuters. The GOP has pounded Obama over the issue, saying it's a question of whether he wants to create jobs and import energy from an ally, or lose jobs and see Canadian oil go to Asia instead. The pipeline proposal has forced the White House to make a politically risky choice between two important Democratic constituencies. Many unions back the project because of the prospects of new jobs in a down economy. In brief: Press Secretary Jay Carney hinted earlier in the day that the Obama administration would reject the pipleline decision earlier today . Environmentalists argue that the pipeline would create a risk of calamitous oil spills, as well as an influx of greenhouse gasses. Some liberal donors threatened to cut off funds to Mr Obama's re-election campaign to protest the project, which opponents say would transport 'dirty oil' that requires huge amounts of energy to extract. TransCanada says the project could create as many as 20,000 jobs over two years; opponents say that figure is inflated. A State Department report last summer said the pipeline would create up to 6,000 jobs during construction.","Obama says he's denying application because of GOP-mandated deadline .

"By . James Chapman, Tim Shipman and Jason Groves . Last updated at 9:16 AM on 13th December 2011 . Nick Clegg became the incredible sulk of British politics yesterday by snubbing David Cameron’s triumphant appearance in the Commons. The Prime Minister was cheered by Tory MPs for his historic veto of a new EU treaty at the Brussels summit. His pro-EU deputy ducked yesterday’s session, telling Mr Cameron he would be a ‘distraction’ on the Government front bench. Snub: Nick Clegg, pictured leaving the Commons, said last night that he did not appear in the House for David Cameron's statement as he thought he would be a 'distraction' Triumphant: David Cameron was in full flow yesterday as he explained his historic veto of a new EU treaty, saying he was right to 'defend Britain's national interest' Instead, he took to the TV studios to accuse the Prime Minister of endangering the livelihoods of millions of Britons by risking isolation in Europe. Attack: Ed Miliband said Mr Cameron's decision was 'the biggest mistake of Britain in Europe in a generation' during his reply to the Prime Minister . Mr Clegg is understood to be demanding that the UK begin a ‘process of building bridges and re-engagement’ in Brussels. Pressed about the Deputy Prime Minister’s absence, Mr Cameron told MPs: ‘I’m not responsible for his whereabouts.’ Frantic behind-the-scenes talks were held throughout the day to try to paper over the cracks between the Tories and the Lib Dems following Mr Cameron’s refusal to sign up to an EU power grab supposed to save the euro. Mr Cameron insisted he had been right to stick to his word and ‘defend Britain’s national interest’. He made clear he thinks EU leaders have got it wrong on the euro – but he went out of his way not to offend Lib Dems. He told Tory Eurosceptics that Britain’s membership of the EU was not in question and that the issue of a referendum would not arise because no powers would pass from Westminster to Brussels. Downing Street also apparently agreed to soften its position on stopping other states using the institutions of the 27-member EU – if they can forge a fiscal union. Mr Clegg has argued such a move would be ludicrous. In the Commons, Mr Cameron insisted Mr Clegg had endorsed the strategy that he now appears to regret. ‘The negotiating approach was agreed by the Government before I went to Brussels,’ the Prime Minister said. In what some took as a swipe at Mr Clegg, who initially backed Mr Cameron’s stance before howls of protest from senior Lib Dems, the Prime Minister added: ‘I did exactly what I said I was going to do. Apparently in politics these days, that’s very surprising. Praise: John Redwood, left, said Britain was much stronger because Mr Cameron was not afraid to say 'No', while Sir Peter Tapsell expressed his 'full-hearted support' for the Prime Minister . Debate: Members filled the Commons benches yesterday afternoon to hear Mr Cameron's statement before many offered support from both sides of the House . ‘Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have not always agreed about European integration but we have both set aside our interests to work in the national interest of having a government that is able to clear up the mess that Labour left. ‘Britain remains a full member of the European Union and the events of last week do nothing to change that. Our membership of the EU is vital to our national interest.’ But he added: ‘The balance of powers between Britain and Europe isn’t right and there are powers I would like to see returned.’ Mr Clegg said it did not matter who sat where in the Commons and added: ‘I would have been a distraction if I was there ... I have made my views clear about Britain’s isolation at the summit last week. ‘I have made it very clear that I think isolation in Europe, where we are one against 26, is potentially a bad thing for jobs, a bad thing for growth and a bad thing for the livelihoods of millions of people in this country. ‘When I was told the outcome of the . summit, after it finished, I immediately told the Prime Minister that I . could not welcome it, that I thought it was bad for Britain. I have . stayed with that view since, and I have simply amplified on my reasons . for that since the summit.’ Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable, who was in the Commons, has also vowed to launch an offensive to keep Britain in Europe – saying the Government’s policy cannot be to ‘cut off its nose to spite its face’. Conservative MPs lined up to applaud the Prime Minister’s stance. Sir Peter Tapsell expressed ‘admiration and full-hearted support at this definitive moment in his first premiership’. Eurosceptic former Cabinet minister John Redwood said: ‘Britain has much more negotiating strength today, because Europe knows that it is dealing with a Prime Minister who will say “No” if he needs to.’ Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell praised Mr Cameron’s ‘bulldog spirit’. Labour leader Ed Miliband however attacked Mr Cameron for what he called ‘the biggest mistake of Britain in Europe for a generation’. Lib Dem Baroness Tonge said that a general election was needed to ‘clear the air’ between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats. She criticised Mr Clegg’s failure to appear in the Commons, saying: ‘He should have been there and stuck it out frankly. ‘He is the deputy leader of that government. He should have been there.’ Nicolas Sarkozy said yesterday: ‘There are clearly two Europes. One that wants more solidarity among its members and more regulation. The other which is attached only to the logic of the single market.’ He added that he and German chancellor Angela Merkel had done everything they could to keep Britain on board – implying Mr Cameron did not want a deal. Senior Lib Dems also in the Commons included Energy Secretary Chris Huhne and Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury.","Deputy PM says his appearance would have been a 'distraction'

"By . Richard Hartley-parkinson . Last updated at 9:08 AM on 17th January 2012 . A YouGov poll found that 70 per cent of Labour voters believe Ed Miliband is not fit to become prime minister . After being deemed 'too ugly' to become prime minister, Ed Miliband has been dealt another blow after it was revealed that 70 per cent of people don't believe in him. The YouGov poll gives him his worst rating since winning the Labour leadership and a sure sign that supporters are turning away from him. The shedding of support continued today after a blogger and Labour activist started trending on Twitter when he posted an article about why he recently switched allegiance to the Conservatives. Luke Bozier, a party member for five years, wrote: 'At a time when the nation needs strong political leadership, Labour offers nothing. The poll carried out for the Sunday Times showed that fewer Labour voters believe Mr Miliband is performing well compared to those who think he is doing a job. He received an overall rating of -3 points compared to David Cameron's 91 and Nick Clegg's 45 from Lib Dems. Further rubbing salt into the wounds, most people said they believe his elder brother, David, would do a better job but he has ruled out standing again. An MP was quoted by the newspaper as saying: '[David Miliband] said fratricide is one thing, double fratricide is quite another. It would destroy the party and [the brothers'] relationship.' In a scathing attack on the Labour party, blogger Luke Bozier trended on Twitter after switching allegiance . He has the right policies, and and also looks and sounds like a possible Prime Minister: 16% . He has the right policies, but does NOT look or sound like a possible prime minister: 59% . His policies are wrong, but he looks and sounds like a possible Prime Minister: 5% . His policies are wrong, and he does NOT look or sound [like] a possible Prime Minister: 11% . Don't know: 9% . Alistair Darling is the second choice for Labour voters pushing Miliband into third place with just seven per cent saying he is the best person to lead the party. Shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, has been touted as the favourite candidate for the job if Miliband is replaced by the time of the next election in spring 2015. Last week it was suggested by John Humphrys that Ed Miliband did not look right for the job of PM to which he replied 'I don't accept that'. However, only 10 per cent of people said they thought that Miliband was 'too ugly' for the job. The prospect of a leadership election has been ruled out at this stage, however, with some of his harshest critics saying it is too early, instead believing autumn 2013 to be the best time for change. Embattled Ed Miliband was told by Labour MPs on Saturday night to stop copying David Cameron and start showing some leadership of his own. The Labour leader sparked a furious backlash after the party abandoned opposition to the Coalition's public-sector pay freeze and refused to reverse cuts. The U-turn was unveiled by Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, who insisted the party had to set a 'credible' alternative to the Coalition and be 'honest with the British people'. But Labour MPs accused the two Eds of caving into the Tory agenda. Labour veteran Austin Mitchell attacked 'barmy' Mr Balls's cuts somersaults and also lambasted 'weak' Mr Miliband. He told The Mail on Sunday: 'This is a desperate attempt to get respectability but it's barmy. Miliband is acting out of weakness. We are not the Government and we will get nowhere by going around wearing a hair shirt like this.' The poll was carried out just days after Miliband underwent a relaunch to answer those who doubted his abilities as leader. In a scathing attack on the Labour party, Mr Bozier writes in his blog that Yvette Cooper and Ed Balls were 'out-of-touch', Brownite career politicians. He criticises the wider party saying it has been taken over by student politicians and is unable to 'put aside its tribal prejudice and ideology'. He writes: 'Ed Miliband is a leader that Labour MPs and Labour members didn't want. He was forced upon them by the Trade Unions and like most people, I wasn't happy with the result. 'I tried for as long as I could to give Ed the benefit of the doubt. But look what it's come to, with the party and the leader now a national laughing stock. 'Rarely in British history has a leader become so quickly defined by humiliating questions about his looks and personality. On his new allegiance to the Tory's, Mr Bozier said: 'David Cameron, sensing the intellectual and political paralysis throughout the Labour Party, has picked up New Labour's baton of reform and is running with it. 'Cameron's Conservatives have again become the party of the aspirational classes.' He concludes: 'But the Labour Party - which has comfortably turned back into Old Labour - no longer speaks for this country. 'And it no longer speaks for me and the sort of Britain I want for my children. And that is why, today, I am joining the Conservatives.'","Just one in five Labour voters say they think he would make a good prime minister .

Police first spotted Rodriguez in the passenger’s seat of the Accord last Sunday, and immediately identified him, as he is notorious within the small town of Hermiston, Oregon. Officers knew he was wanted for questioning regarding the stolen vehicle, and he was identified as a suspect for a robbery the night before. According to Acting Police Chief Jason Edmiston, Rodriguez slid into the driver’s seat after the car pulled over to the side of the road, and took off. After leading officers on a three-block chase, Rodriguez ran a red light, slamming into a 1999 Volkswagen Jetta in the intersection, the Tri-City Herald reports.

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 3:54 PM on 19th January 2012 . No remorse: Maksim Gelman listens to relatives of his victims during his sentencing at Supreme Court in New York, Wednesday . A 24-year-old man who pleaded guilty to murder and other crimes in a violent stabbing rampage in New York City last winter was sentenced today to 200 years in prison during a hearing in which he hurled epithets at one of his victims and was told by the judge that he was a 'sociopath'. Maksim Gelman, born in Ukraine, pleaded guilty in November in Brooklyn to murder and other charges in the spree in February 2011, which included stabbing his stepfather and two others to death, fatally running down a pedestrian, stealing a car and attacking a subway passenger. Today, he was sentenced to the maximum sentence for each of 13 counts; some of the sentences will run consecutively, resulting in the 200-year term. 'You are a violent predator and sociopath,' Judge Vincent Del Giudice said. Gelman's deadly spree on February 11 started with a family argument over whether he could use his mother's car. He . stabbed his stepfather to death in their Brooklyn home, then took off . in the car and drove to the home of an acquaintance, Yelena Bulchenko. Bulchenko's friends have said he was obsessed with the 20-year-old woman . and imagined a romantic relationship with her. She wasn't home, but Gelman stabbed . her 56-year-old mother to death, then waited nearly nine hours with the . body for the daughter to return. When she walked in, he stabbed her 11 . times, killing her, authorities said. On Wednesday, Gelman interrupted . Bulchenko's boyfriend, Gerard Honig, telling him he had fallen in love . 'with a heroin addict,' to which Honig responded, 'You can burn in . hell.' Gelman was then removed from the courtroom for a short time. Maxiumum sentence: Some of Gelman's sentences will run consecutively, resulting in in the 200-year term for each of the 13 counts . Tense: Gelman during the sentencing interrupted the boyfriend of one of his victims, telling him he had fallen in love 'with a heroin addict,' to which the man responded, 'You can burn in hell' After stabbing Bulchenko, Gelman left the home, rear-ended a car and wildly stabbed at the driver, authorities said. The driver survived. Stealing the wounded man's car, Gelman drove off and ploughed into 62-year-old Stephen Tanenbaum, who died from his injuries. After abandoning the car, he later hailed a livery cab and attacked its driver, then approached another car, attacked a man inside and seized the car, police said. Both men survived. All those attacks happened in . Brooklyn. As authorities hunted him, Gelman was next spotted hours later . on a subway train in Manhattan, where passengers recognised him from . newspaper photographs and notified police. Tragic: Gelman is accused of driving to 20-year-old Yelena Bulchenko's home on East 24th Street and stabbing her . Gruesome: Yelena and her mother, 56-year-old Anna, were killed at the same Brooklyn address . Victim: Gelman is accused of repeatedly stabbing Joseph Lozito, 40, on the subway, before he was arrested in February . He dashed across the tracks, switched . trains and attacked a final passenger before he was grabbed by police . who were in the subway car looking for him on the tracks. The livery driver, Fitz Fullerton, spoke at the Wednesday hearing in a whisper because his voice box was damaged by Gelman.'I just got caught up in this, this is my like third time ever seeing him and I hope he gets what he deserves,' Fullerton said. Gelman also made a brief statement, saying 'I'm not the bad guy here,' and that it wasn't his fault. He also said he was being followed by federal agents in an undercover investigation. Gelman had previously said he wasn't guilty, was under medical supervision and his attorney, Edward Friedman, described his client's mental state as fragile. Arrest: Gelman is led away from the subway after stabbing an innocent passenger on the train on February 13 . Spree's over: Gelman, of Brooklyn, is put into a car by officers outside the 61st Precinct . But given the evidence and a psychiatrist's recent opinion that Gelman couldn't argue he was not guilty by reason of insanity, he decided he wanted to get out of his holding cell and start serving his time in a permanent facility, his lawyer said. No plea deal was offered. On Tuesday, Gelman admitted trying to kill passenger Joseph Lozito on a train on February 12 at the end of his two-day spree. Police later recovered a bloody knife, three straight razor blades, a paring knife and $932. When asked by police why the four victims had to die, Gelman said, 'Because I said so,' according to the documents.","Maksim Gelman, 24, pleaded guilty to killing four people and wounding four others in a 28-hour stabbing spree across New York .

"By . Rebecca Seales . Last updated at 4:40 PM on 19th January 2012 . A pensioner was duped out of his life savings by a con-artist who posed as the heir to an Italian millionairess, a court was told. Scott Travis, 44, is alleged to have cheated nearly £100,000 from the man after claiming his name was 'Franco' and that he was set to get £1.7m from his mother's will. He also claimed he needed to fly to Italy for specialist cancer treatment, and turned up at the pensioner's house with a bandaged head after having a 'tumour' removed. Alleged conman: Scott Travis tried to dodge photographers as he left Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester. He denies charges of fraud, obtaining property by deception, blackmail and perverting the course of justice . Minshull Street Crown Court heard that Travis was actually on benefits and living in a Manchester council house with his girlfriend Gail Heyworth. Lisa Boocock, prosecuting, said: 'It was all a sham. He was using the money to pay for plastic surgery.' The court was told that Travis got into a relationship with the pensioner after placing a personal advert in a newspaper which said he was seeking companionship. It was claimed he then made several demands for cash between 2003 and 2010. Ms Boocock said: 'At first the man didn't object. He was happy to help somebody... but the demands kept coming.' The jury heard that Travis, of Baguley Crescent, Middleton, demanded £20,000 for 'cancer treatment' in Italy and cash to pay off debtors. Ms Boocock said the pensioner was 'absolutely terrified' for the safety of 'Franco' and went to the police, who told him he may have been the victim of a con-artist. At that stage he decided not to make a formal complaint. On trial: The prosecution claim Travis used the £100,000 he swindled to pay for plastic surgery, and lied about needing specialist cancer treatment . Travis then disappeared, but returned in 2010 and claimed he needed £35,000 to release cash from his mother's will. The court was told that another man, David Hannon, went to the pensioner's house and told him he was going to hurt 'Franco' unless the pensioner paid £30,000. Ms Boocock said the pensioner was so frightened that he moved out of his home and went to stay with relatives. The prosecution claim Travis and Miss Heyworth, 50, later tried to contact him and that she left phone messages in which she pretended to be a solicitor. The pensioner, speaking to the court via a video-link, said: 'I trusted him. I liked him. Something about him was appealing. He was remarkable in his knowledge of ancient Greece and Rome. He was very attractive to me intellectually.' Travis denies four counts of obtaining property by deception, one count of fraud, two counts of blackmail and one count of perverting the course of justice. Miss Heyworth, of Baguley Crescent, Middleton, denies one count of perverting the court of justice.","Scott Travis, 44, 'posed as Franco to con pensioner'

"Police hunt 'person of interest' in case of sexual battery . Alabama University students cheered and took pictures on camera phones . By . Louise Boyle . Last updated at 10:36 PM on 18th January 2012 . A college football fan inflicted a horrifying sexual assault on a rival supporter after he passed out in a fast food restaurant following the game. A video taken on a camera phone showed a group of students from Alabama University surround the Louisiana State University student who is slumped over a table passed out, at a Krystal restaurant in New Orleans on January 9. The footage was uploaded to the Alabama University sports channel BamaSportsForum on YouTube - and promptly deleted after it swept the Internet. It shows a man climbing on top of the rival fan and rubbing his genitals repeatedly in his face. Sinister attack: An Alabama University football fan climbed onto an unconscious student from Louisiana State and rubbed his genitals in his face following a game in New Orleans . V for victory: The attacker raises his arms in celebration after he shoved his genitals into another man's face - he then returns to assault him again at the packed fast food restaurant in New Orleans . The alleged sexual assault happened following a game between the two colleges during the Bowl Championship Series where Alabama beat LSU 21-0. The clip, which lasts for five minutes shows a group dressed in crimson Alabama shirts placing cartons on the young man's head while whooping and cheering, snapping pictures on their camera phones. One voice, off camera, says: 'This guy's life is over.' The hazing continues with rival fans . sticking straws up the man's nose and leaning over him while football . chants echo around the fast food joint, where hundreds of fans have . gathered. Another man adds: 'Seriously, I don't see him moving' before adding, 'someone has to pour water on him.' The man shifts slightly in the seat with his head slumped on the table but remains unconscious. 'Person of interest': New Orleans police have release the photograph of this man who they would like to speak to following the incident in New Orleans on January 9 . Getting into the spirit: Alabama student Ellen Cassin, dressed in the team's shirt, poses for a picture over the unconscious LSU student (left) and having more fun (right) It is then that a rival fan, dressed in a baseball cap, red hoodie and khaki shorts pulls his genitals out of his pants and climbs over the other man, grinding into face. The identity of the man who carried out . the attack was yet to be revealed and it was uncertain whether he was a . college student. Two students in the clip have been identified by Deadspin.com - Patrick Setterstrom and his blonde girlfriend Ellen . Cassin. He appears to attempt to expose himself at the start of the . video before his girlfriend restrains him. Since the clip appeared both . have deleted their Facebook profiles. The . recent college graduate is the son of Alabama's WKRG TV station's . sports director Randy Patrick Setterstrom. The station admitted that it . was their director's 22-year-old son. Remi Braden, director of public . affairs at New Orleans Police Department, told MailOnline: 'We were . alerted to the video last Sunday and immediately started a preliminary . investigation. 'No one in the restaurant where the . incident occurred contacted police but the investigation is ongoing. Because this is a possible sexual battery case, we are not in a position . to release more information at this time.' College graduate: Patrick Setterstrom (left) at first tries to reveal himself before he is stopped by his more sensible girlfriend Ellen Cassin. He recently left college (right) The victim may not necessarily have to come forward as charges can be brought in the name of the state. However Ric Simmons, a criminal law professor at the Ohio State University Moritz College of Law, points out that this is a far from a straightforward case. He told MailOnline: 'Technically a prosecutor does not need a victim to prosecute a crime, as long as there is other evidence sufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. 'But although it is possible to obtain a conviction in a case like this without a victim, it will be difficult to do so. A jury may not take the case very seriously if there is no victim willing to testify. 'In this case, as reprehensible as the conduct may appear to some, others may see it as merely a crude college prank which does not rise to the level of criminal behavior.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 7:06 PM on 11th August 2011 . An 11-year-old girl arrested during rioting smirked and refused to apologise to a judge when she appeared in court this morning. Nottingham magistrates heard the youngster had not yet began senior school having finished at primary school only last month. The court heard the defendant, who can't be named because of her age, had travelled 16 miles on Tuesday from her foster home in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, to Nottingham city centre. Prosecutor Sumaiya Saeedullah said the girl was in a MacDonald's restaurant in the centre of Nottingham with a friend at around 7pm when she heard talk of there being a riot. Young crime: An 11-year-old girl leaves Nottingham Magistrates Court today after admitting criminal damage in the riots, and right, a 12 year-old-boy who admitted burglary at Manchester Magistrates Court today . Ms Saeedullah said the defendant later told police she had been in a 'happy mood' because she was about to take part in a riot. She . left the fast food restaurant and joined a group of about 30 males and . three other girls. Most of them masked their faces with bandannas. The . prosecutor described what happened next as 'a large scale rampage'. The . 11-year-old was seen by witnesses hurling stones at shop windows. They . gave a description of the girl to police who arrested her on Milton . Street in Nottingham city centre between 11.30pm and midnight on . Tuesday. She had been in custody until her court appearance this morning. District . Judge Morris Cooper heard the mixed race girl, who looks older than her . age, made full admissions to police after she had been arrested. She . told officers she had been 'egged on' by others present, grabbed stones . from a plant pot and hurled them at two fashion shop windows, New Look . and Flannels. Damage: A policewoman stands outside Canning Circus police station in Nottingham after it was firebombed during riots in the city . During the interview she told police that she knew she was taking part in a serious disturbance but 'wasn't bothered'. She . told police: 'I knew it was going to be bad, I just went along with . everyone else. I knew I could get into serious trouble but none of us . thought we were going to get caught.' The court heard she had received a caution for criminal damage in 2010. During . the proceedings she at times laughed and chatted with two male security . guards who sat with her in the dock behind a glass panel. Judge Cooper asked the girl's . solicitor, Lauren Manuel: 'Does she have any indication how serious this . is?' to which Ms Manuel replied: 'She now realises it was more than . just messing about. Her understanding of what happened is limited . because of her age.' Damage: Looters spill out of a Sainsbury's store in Manchester that was vandalised during the riots on Tuesday evening . Mob: Crowds gather on Oldham Street in Manchester during he unrest that saw widespread damage . The defendant's father was in court and spoke up on her behalf. He . said: 'She knows what she has done and wants to say sorry. She is going . through a bad time at the moment and just ran away from her foster . place. She has got a sister going through care.' When prompted twice by her father to . apologise to the judge for what she had done the girl said nothing, . smirked and looked away. She admitted an offence of criminal damage and another of attempted criminal damage. A student has been jailed for six months for looting a £3.50 case of water from Lidl during the violence that erupted across the streets of London this week. Nicholas Robinson, 23, was walking back from his girlfriends house in Brixton in the early hours of Monday morning when he saw the superstore on Acre Lane being looted by rioters. He took the opportunity to go in and help himself to a case of water because he was 'thirsty'. But when the police came in, at around 2.40am, he discarded the bottles and attempted to flee the scene. He was caught and arrested by officers at the scene.  Wearing a black leather jacket, the electrical engineering student, looked shocked as he was jailed by District Judge Alan Baldwin at Camberwell Magistrates Court today. There were gasps from the public gallery as the judge handed down the maximum penalty he could to Robinson, who has no previous convictions, for his part in the 'chaos'. District Judge Baldwin said: 'The burglary of commercial premises in circumstances such as this, where substantial and serious public disorder is or has taken place is commonly known as looting.'Robinson, from south London, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to a charge of burglary of a place other than other than a dwelling (theft). Zahid Hussain, prosecuting, said: 'This defendant has contributed through his action to criminal activities to the atmosphere of chaos and sheer lawlessness.' Robinson claimed it was an 'opportunistic' crime, and he only went in when he saw the store unsecure and wanted a drink. The Judge told her: 'You are only 11. This is very serious but because of your age you are going to to get a referral order.' The Judge told the girl that as part . of the referral order she and her father would have to cooperate with a . Youth Offending Team and added the order would be for nine months. 'Nine months is much longer than usual, but that is to reflect the seriousness of what happened,' the Judge added. Outside of court the girl pulled her hood tight to hide her face while her father hurled angry abuse at photographers. Three 14-year-old boys have also been charged with violent disorder in the city which was rocked by violence in copy-cat riots. In a separate incident, a . gang of youths in the St Anns area of the city, which has a long . history of gun crime,  hurled petrol bombs at a police station, setting . it alight. Dozens more cars were damaged and a container of 200 tyres was set alight. Nottinghamshire . Police said 105 people have been arrested following the violence in the . city and 46 people have so far been charged. Although police dealt with a handful . of incidents of criminal damage, there were only four arrests overnight, . compared with 86 during the previous evening. Assistant . Chief Constable Paul Scarrott, who commanded last night's policing . operation, said: 'On Monday night, there were sporadic and serious . incidents of criminality. 'That night, our tactic was to repel and separate large groups of youths intent on congregating in the city and suburbs. 'On Tuesday night, we warned that our tactics would be different. 'Again . we drove the hooligans back, but this time we made many arrests. We . prevented widespread looting and major fires, and despite attacks on . police officers, vehicles and police stations, we stood firm and . demonstrated that we would not tolerate such behaviour. 'Last night, we had our strongest presence yet on the streets, lest anyone had failed to get the zero-tolerance message.' 'For that reason, we will continue to . have at our disposal significant numbers of officers on duty, throughout . the city and elsewhere, ready to respond 24/7 for the coming days and . nights.' The court case with the 11-year-old came as a 12-year-old boy admitted burglary in Manchester. The youngster, who cannot be named because of his age, appeared ashamed, telling the court: 'I did the wrong thing.' But outside court his mother, asked by reporters why her son was looting, replied: 'Watch your f******  face!' and the youngster told one photographer to 'f***    off!' He was the latest to appear in the dock at Manchester Magistrates Court following a night of lawlessness in the city on Tuesday. Some shamefaced defendants appeared to have got caught up in the general lawlessness and looked contrite as they stood in the dock, while others, with long records, shrugged their shoulders. All those who admitted their involvement in the looting will be sentenced at Manchester Crown Court.","Girl was in a 'happy mood' because she was taking part in riots .

"By . Rick Dewsbury . Last updated at 11:56 AM on 19th January 2012 . Avtar and Carole Kolar were found by their son this morning after they failed to answer his calls . A Lithuanian man appeared in court this morning charged with the double murder of a policeman's parents who were found dead in their home. Rimvydas Liorancas, 37, appeared at Birmingham Magistrates' Court, wearing a black T-shirt and black tracksuit bottoms. He is accused of killing Avtar Kolar, 62, and his wife Carole, 58, who were discovered at their house in Handsworth Wood, Birmingham, last Wednesday. Liorancas spoke only to confirm his name and address, through an interpreter and the case was sent to Birmingham Crown Court for January 23. Among the people in the public gallery were the couple's daughter Michelle Kirwan, 39, and son Avtar Kolar, 32, who gave an emotional press conference last week, saying their hearts had been 'broken forever', as well as Jason Kolar, who found his parents' bodies. Both brothers  stared intently at Liorancas throughout the brief hearing. Before the court appearance, police said that the motive for the murders of the couple was nothing to do with their policeman son's job, police work with gangs, or the theft of gold. The murder weapon used was a lump hammer recovered at the scene, Detective Chief Superintendent Steve Jupp said. He added: 'I can confirm that the motive of these murders was not due to the fact that Jason is a serving police officer. 'I can also confirm that it was nothing to do with the work the force undertakes in relation to gangs. Neither was the motive  in relation to the theft of gold.' However, the officer confirmed that a number of items had been stolen from the family home. Those items have now been recovered . 'The devastating impact of such a senseless crime has been far-reaching and the comfort drawn by the family from words of friends, the community and further afield has been much appreciated by them,' Mr Jupp added. 'The investigation into Carole and Avtar's death has been complex and very fast-moving. 'I would like to say thank you to those who have come forward and given us our information. It is the information given by local people to our officers that is vital and in this case we have received a number of very important phone calls. 'We are not looking for anyone else in connection with this murder but much work remains to be done to bring this investigation to court. 'The Kolar family have been updated at each stage of our inquiry and continue to be supported by specialist officers and staff. We hope that they will now be given some time and privacy to grieve their tragic loss.' A forensic tent is put up outside the home in Handsworth Wood, Birmingham where the two bodies were discovered . Police teams looking for clues search drains near the house in the days after the discovery . Mr and Mrs Kolar, who had been married for 40 years, were found at the Friary Road property by their policeman son Jason, 37 . He had gone to the property in Friary Road to check on them after family members had been unable to make contact. In an emotional appeal, the couple's daughter Michelle Kirwan said her parents were ‘the sweetest, kindest people’. Referring to their brother and . sister, their four children and eight grandchildren, the 39-year-old . added: ‘Whoever has done this has taken not just two lives, but 16. ‘My mum and dad were the sweetest, kindest people that I have ever met and would do anything for anyone. ‘As . a family, we could not have been closer. We did everything together – . holidays, Christmas, birthdays and weddings. Our hearts are broken for . ever and our lives will never be the same.' Mr Kolar described the impact of the . murder on his family. ‘The hardest thing anyone could ever do is to tell . their children that they will never see Nanny and Grandad again,’ he . said. Heartbreak: Michelle Kirwan and her brother Avtar Kolar break down in tears as they speak about their love for their murdered parents . Tearful: Ms Kirwan told the press conference that after her family learned of the killing 'the light was switched out in our lives and our hearts have been broken forever' ‘I just don’t know where to start.’ Struggling . to contain his composure, he added: ‘They were so special – not only to . us, but to everybody who ever met them. They wouldn’t hurt a fly.’ Post-mortem examinations revealed both died as a result of blunt-force trauma to the head, each sustaining a number of blows. Liorancas, who was arrested at a . Birmingham address on Monday, was the third person to be arrested on . suspicion of the double murder. Two men, aged 41 and 24, who were previously arrested in connection with the murders have been released without charge, West Midlands Police said. Last week a large cash reward was offered to encourage people to come forward with information about the 'atrocious' murder of the couple, who had been married for 40 years and have four children and eight grandchildren. Crimestoppers has described the double murder as a 'vile crime' and put up a reward of up to £10,000 for details leading to the arrest and conviction of the perpetrators.","Son's job or theft of gold had 'nothing to do with the murder'

"By . Michael Seamark and Nick Mcdermott . Last updated at 8:03 AM on 20th January 2012 . Suspicions: Jude Law, pictured with Sadie Frost, said he was subjected to a 'sustained campaign' of surveillance, pursuit and harassment . News International’s soaring phone-hacking bill was approaching £10million last night after dozens more celebrities and politicians received large payouts. Actor Jude Law’s £130,000 award was the highest settlement as Rupert Murdoch’s media empire continued to count the devastating cost of the News of the World scandal. The Oscar-nominated star was one of 18 victims who received a combined total of more than £645,000. There were a further 19 victims whose awards were not disclosed. All payments were exclusive of legal costs, which News International has agreed to pay and are expected to dwarf the damages. The company has also amassed huge bills for its own legal representation. Mr Law said he had been the victim of a ‘sustained campaign’ of surveillance, pursuit and harassment, and received damages and a public apology at the High Court. Solicitors said that yesterday’s 37 awards are merely the ‘tip of the iceberg’. Police investigating voicemail interceptions by the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire on behalf of the newspaper discovered 5,800 names in his notebooks, of whom they believe about 800 may have been victims of hacking. Mr Murdoch has already paid out £3million to the parents of murdered schoolgirl  Milly Dowler, and huge six-figure sums to PR man Max Clifford and Professional Footballers’ Association chief executive Gordon Taylor – quite apart from dramatically closing down the 168-year-old Sunday tabloid. Next month singer Charlotte Church, comedian and actor Steve Coogan and Liberal Democrat MP Simon Hughes are among ten more phone-hacking victims taking their cases to court for a full hearing which may provide a ‘tariff’ for future settlements. The payouts announced yesterday are . likely to encourage more claims and Mark Lewis, the Dowler family . solicitor, said: ‘While congratulations are due to those solicitors and . clients who have settled their cases, it is important that we don’t get . carried away into thinking that the war is over. ‘This . is just one of the early battles. Fewer than 1 per cent of the people . who were hacked have settled their cases. There are many more cases in . the pipeline. ‘There will . be lots more revelations of wrongdoing and lots more compensation to be . paid. It is too early to celebrate, we’re not even at the end of the . beginning.’ Payout: Jude Law, pictured with Guy Ritchie at the Sherlock Holmes 2 premier last night, received a £130,000 payout from News International . The phone-hacking saga began with the conviction in 2007 of private investigator Mulcaire and the News of the World’s royal editor Clive Goodman. At the time News International subsidiary News Group Newspapers said the hacking, involving the voicemails of royal aides, was an isolated incident. But the settlement of legal action by Gordon Taylor and Max Clifford led to speculation that phone hacking was more widespread. Payouts: Lord Prescott, left, received £40,000 compensation while Joan Hammell, his former aide, received the same amount. Gavin Henson, right, who used to date Charlotte Church, received the same amount . As more details of the scandal emerged last summer, NGN decided to close the News of the World and David Cameron set up the Leveson Inquiry to examine the behaviour of the Press. The 37 settlements announced yesterday included former Labour deputy leader Lord Prescott, who received £40,000 after his voicemails were intercepted, as did his chief of staff Joan Hammell. Lord Prescott said: ‘This at long last brings clarity, apology and compensation for the years of hacking into my telephone messages by Rupert Murdoch’s News Group Newspapers.’ Other politicians who received damages were Labour’s Chris Bryant and Denis MacShane and former Labour MP Claire Ward. Compensation: Sadie Frost, the designer, received £50,000 while Chelsea footballer Ashley Cole was given an undisclosed amount . Sportsmen who were awarded damages were footballer Ashley Cole and rugby player Gavin Henson. Statements were read out in court concerning 18 of the victims and in each case the NGN barrister Michael Silverleaf, QC, said it offered its ‘sincere apologies’ for the damage, as well as the distress caused by ‘the unlawful accessing of voicemail messages and obtaining confidential information’. Gavin Millar, QC, for Mulcaire, said the private investigator – who is also being sued for breach of confidence and misuse of private information – was not involved in agreeing the wording of yesterday’s statements and was not a party to them. When their marriage ended in 2003, Jude Law and Sadie Frost agreed to remain friends for the sake of their three children. But as increasingly intimate details of their private life continued to appear in the pages of The News of The World, Mr Law said the pair became ‘distrustful’ of each other and those close to them. Despite repeatedly changing his mobile phone and even registering it under another person’s name, articles still appeared in the newspaper concerning Mr Law’s personal life. The increasingly wary actor even hired security consultants to undertake a sweep of his car and house to ensure that no listening devices had been installed, but the intrusive stories continued. Both he and Miss Frost were also concerned that journalists appeared to know the location of where they were going, even if they had decided at the last moment. Unable to understand how the paper was acquiring such personal information, the actor began to suspect those closest to him. In reality, he said, ‘no aspect’ of his private life was safe from intrusion by journalists from the paper, who had been illegally accessing both his and Miss Frost’s voicemail messages. They also hacked the phones of Mr Law’s personal assistant Ben Jackson, and that of Ciara Parks, who represented the actor and his girlfriend Sienna Miller for a period, in the pursuit of stories. At one point in 2003, an article was published referring to phone calls Mr Law received from his assistant on arrival at an airport. Even messages left by Mr Law and Miss Frost on the voicemail of their children’s nanny, Jade Schmidt, were intercepted by people working for the Sunday tabloid. In total, 16 articles about Mr Law were published in the News of the World between 2003 and 2006 based on intercepted material. The paper conceded it had subjected him to ‘repeated and sustained physical surveillance over a number of years’, both in Britain and abroad. After settling for agreed damages of £130,000 yesterday, Mr Law said the behaviour was ‘appalling’. ‘For several years leading up to 2006, I was suspicious about how information concerning my private life was coming out in the press,’ he said. ‘I started to become distrustful of people close to me. ‘I was truly appalled by what I was shown by the police and by what my lawyers have discovered. It is clear that I, along with many others, was kept under constant surveillance for a number of years.’ Miss Frost, who accepted £50,000 in damages, said she ‘could not understand’ how her ‘private information was ending up in the public domain’. As a result she ‘began to suspect everyone close to her’ and she and Mr Law began ‘to suspect each other’, she said. Others to speak out included Welsh rugby star Gavin Henson, the ex-partner of Charlotte Church, who accepted £40,000 damages after his phone was hacked. When the News of The World began publishing a series of articles in 2005, he said he ‘initially suspected Charlotte Church’s family of leaking the information and this led to arguments’. Chelsea footballer Ashley Cole and his solicitor Graham Shear were both targeted by the paper. After accepting an undisclosed sum in damages, the player said he was ‘appalled’ about the hacking. Nightclub owner Guy Pelly, a close friend of Prince Harry, was also under surveillance by the tabloid, and yesterday received £40,000 compensation. The businessman said he could not understand how private information ended up in the News of The World, and once phoned his own voicemail remotely only to find it engaged. Glenn Mulcaire’s notes included Mr Pelly’s mobile phone number ‘and other confidential information about him, his family and friends’.","18 actors receive more than £645,000 in the latest round of payouts .

A widow died on an operating table after a surgeon tried to remove the wrong organ, an inquest heard today. Amy Francis, 77, underwent keyhole surgery to remove a cancerous right kidney last July. But during the operation at the Royal Gwent Hospital, Newport, her liver ruptured as it was mistakenly pulled out and, despite desperate efforts to save her, she died of internal bleeding. Consultant urologist Dr Adam Carter, admitted to the error and highlighted that as a result of the death, a modified operating procedure had been communicated 'worldwide'. Her son Alan, 52, praised Dr Carter for his honesty and the  hospital for 'owning up' early. Following the hearing he said: 'We . appreciated Mr Carter’s honesty and him coming along here today and hope . that we can put it all behind us now. 'I . think that it was the honesty that saved the hospital. If we thought . that they had not answered our questions it would have been different. 'This was an honest mistake.' Retired accountant, Mrs Francis, was diagnosed with kidney cancer and was due to be treated after she had recovered from the routine surgery. But during the operation Dr Carter allowed a trainee, who had never performed the procedure before, to locate and remove the organ. As the trainee . wasn't confident enough to remove the organ Dr Carter was forced to . take over, and during the changeover confusion occurred. When he attempted to remove the kidney he was immediately told by the anesthetist that the patient’s blood pressure was dropping and he realised his mistake. Consultant urologist Dr Adam Carter, admitted to the fatal error during an operation performed at the Royal Gwent Hospital . Two senior surgeons were called to the scene and every effort was made to save Mrs Francis, but they were unsuccessful. David Bowen, the coroner for Gwent, said: 'Whilst undergoing keyhole surgery . for the necessary removal of the cancerous kidney, Mrs Francis’s . liver was ruptured when it was mistakenly and unintentionally identified . as the kidney and was catastrophically torn and damaged, resulting in . death.' Dr Carter said he had carried out the procedure 20 times since the death without a problem. Son Alan said before the inquest finished: 'We accept the decision and we also accept that Mr Carter and his team acted in good faith to prolong my mother’s life. 'We also appreciated his honesty and wish him well for the future and hope he goes on to do other successful operations.' Over the last 40 years, the number of cases of kidney cancer has doubled in men and risen by 130 per cent in women, a trend which is believed to be linked to rising obesity figures. There were 3638 new cases diagnosed in men and 2118 new cases diagnosed in woman in England during 2007.","Amy Francis underwent surgery for kidney cancer .

A new generation of skin creams hailed as the ‘holy grail’ of anti-ageing has received more than 5,000 pre-orders in the UK alone - a week before they even go on sale. The Yves Saint Laurent Forever Young Liberator cream uses science to ‘trick’ the skin into regenerating by artificially boosting levels of glycans, complex sugars that play a crucial role in the structure of healthy skin. Experts in ‘glycomics’ or glycobiology - the study of glycans - say they are vital to maintaining the body’s systems but decline in old age, with the skin particularly effected. The Yves Saint Laurent Forever Young Liberator range 'tricks' the skin into regenerating by artificially boosting levels of glycans . The study of the sugars was dubbed ‘one of the ten emerging technologies that would change the world’ by journal Technology Review MIT in 2003, and it has already led to the development of the Hib B vaccine against fatal infant flu. But it is also vital for the skin, YSL parent company L’Oreal says. Researchers have found that by synthesising glycans and boosting the levels of three types of the sugar can give the skin greater thickness and elasticity. A L’Oreal spokeswoman said: 'At our research department the race is on to work out the glycome - all the glycans - of skin because glycans are the key to skin health and regeneration.' To develop the new Forever Young Liberator range, L’Oreal enlisted the help of chemist Professor Peter Seeberger, of the Max Planck Institute. Smooth: Experts in 'glycomics' say they decline in old age, with the skin particularly effected . In two years of research he found that glycans have a role to play in almost every aspect of what skin looks like and also discovered the number of glycans in our skin diminishes with age, meaning cells no longer receive the messages they need to maintain youthful-looking skin. The team realised that by artificially raise the levels of glycans in older skin, you could trick it into behaving like younger skin. The glycan combination, known as Glycantif, has been patented and the firm says it is the first time glycobiology has been applied to skincare. In self tests on 50 women, 88 per cent said their skin looked more luminous while 72 per cent said fine lines appeared less visible. L’Oreal says that more than 5000 UK women have already registered to order the cream, which goes on sale next week. Amandine Ohayon, general manager of Yves Saint Laurent, said: 'This is one of the most amazing scientific breakthroughs we have discovered in relation to anti-aging. 'The products are set to be the holy grail of anti-aging for many women given their proven efficacy. 'Glycobiology is opening up a whole new area of possibilities when it comes to skincare.  “We’re just at the very start of it and are already excited.'",Yves Saint Laurent cream uses science to ‘trick’ the skin into regenerating .
"By . Fiona Macrae . Last updated at 8:05 PM on 14th January 2012 . 'Scapegoat': The Harley Medical Group, claims it is the victim of a conspiracy by surgeons who want to see it out of business . A Harley Street clinic at the centre of the breast implant scare has said the taxpayer should foot the bill to help its patients. The multi-million-pound cosmetic surgery business, which fitted more PIP implants than any other British firm, also claimed it will need a Government loan if it is to help the NHS. Mel Braham, owner of the Harley Medical Group, said his firm had been made a ‘scapegoat’ in the saga and was the victim of a conspiracy by other surgeons who want to see him out of business. The chain is currently deluged with around 2,000 calls a day from women, most of whom want their implants removed. The . group, which had a turnover of more than £30million in 2009, fitted PIP . implants in 13,900 women between September 2001 and 2010. This is . around one in three of the 45,000 sold. Mr . Braham said the business did not have the money, time or space to . remove and replace all the implants – and the NHS should step in. Booming business: The group fitted PIP implants in 13,900 women between September 2001 and 2010 . He . said the chain of 31 clinics, like its patients, was an ‘innocent . victim’ of a regulatory failure, and said it was ‘outrageous’ of the . Government to call on private clinics to take responsibility. His comments have caused fury among MPs, patients, surgeons and lawyers, who say a clinic’s first duty is to its patients, not its profits. They came as Health Secretary Andrew Lansley announced spot checks on plastic surgery clinics and a wide-ranging review of cosmetic surgery practices from nose jobs and laser surgery to injections used to iron out wrinkles. When Anntina Maughan had her  breasts enlarged, she was thrilled with the results. Now, four years later and pregnant, the mother of two couldn't be more unhappy with them. Scans show that one – or both – of the PIP implants have ruptured. But, at five-and-a-half-months pregnant, Miss Maughan, 39, of Crawley in West  Sussex, has been advised against surgery to have them out. Miss Maughan paid Harley Medical Group £5,000 for breast augmentation after enduring years of low self-esteem due to her small bust. Last year she started experiencing burning pains, and then found lumps in her breasts, raising fears of cancer. She now suffers stabbing pains – but has been advised not to have the ruptured implants out when pregnant. Miss Maughan believes the Harley Medical Group should pay to remove and replace the implants after she has her baby. She added: 'It is their fault this happened. I went there in full confidence. If it was up to me, I'd have the implants out right now. I worry because I don't know what was in them.' Mr Lansley also pointed the finger at Germany, by naming it as the country that approved the French-made PIPs for use in Europe. Industry experts say that the combination of cut-price implants and low payments to surgeons would have allowed clinics using PIPs to make an extra profit of up to £1,000 per patient. Tests have confirmed that PIP . implants, which are extra-fragile and filled with industrial-grade . silicone believed to have been made for mattresses, do not cause cancer. However, the Department of Health . admits they should never have been put in the human body and the Health . Secretary has cleared the way for all women who want them removed to . have it done. Last Friday, . Mr Lansley said private clinics have a ‘moral duty’ to take them out and . if they don’t, the NHS will step in. However, the pledge doesn’t . include the replacement of implants. Many . private chains have agreed to help their patients free of charge but . two of the largest groups have ignored Mr Lansley’s call. Transform, . Britain’s biggest cosmetic surgery group, is ‘reviewing its options’. But as it stands, it is charging patients £2,800 to replace PIP . implants. The Harley Medical Group has so far removed and replaced . ruptured implants for free – but only if they were fitted in the past . two years. Mr Braham, who previously ran a travel . agency in Australasia, said his business couldn’t cope with the panic . from its patients. He said: ‘We don’t have the number of surgeons, the . hospitals and the anaesthetists and we don’t have the financial capacity . to do it for nothing. ‘We . do roughly 5,000 to 6,000 operations a year and are not capable of . adding another 13,900 on top of that.’ Instead, he wants the NHS to take . the implants out – and put new ones in when the woman is on the . operating table. Mr Braham . wants the Health Service to pay for the bulk of the costs. The firm . would pay for new implants – but would need a loan from the Government. The Government however said it would be ‘irresponsible’ of the Harley . Medical Group not to help its patients. Fazel Fatah, president of the British . Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said: ‘We find it . outrageous…when women’s peace of mind is at stake, some clinics are . refusing to honour their ostensible commitment to duty of care, . particularly when they made a profit by using cheaper products and . resources.’ Dutch authorities have reversed their earlier advice on PIPs and said women who had the implants should have them removed.","The clinic - which fitted more PIP implants than any other British firm - says it has been made a 'scapegoat' in the saga .

Across England and Wales, robbery rose by 4 per cent in the year to September 2011 compared with the previous 12 months. There were 15,313 knifepoint robberies in the same period – up 10 per cent from the 13,971 offences a year earlier, police crime statistics showed. Around half of all robberies took place in London and the most common items stolen were smartphones, bags and cash. The Metropolitan Police recorded a 13 per cent rise in robberies in the capital and West Midlands Police recorded a 10 per cent increase. Former Met commissioner Lord Stevens, who is chairing a commission into the future of policing set up by Labour, said the rise in crimes against the person was ‘a bit alarming’. He said: ‘I’m not surprised. It’s really worrying. We’ve got to get on top of them really quickly or you could run out of control.’ The British Crime Survey, based on a poll of more than 40,000 victims, suggested a 5 per cent rise in burglary, and a 7 per cent increase in car theft. Pickpocket thefts rose by 12 per cent to nearly 600,000, while garden shed break-ins fuelled a 15 per cent rise in other thefts of personal property. Policing minister Nick Herbert said there are areas of concern and crime remains too high . However ministers will be heartened that overall recorded crime fell fractionally. The number recorded was down by 4 per cent to 4.1million. Chief Constable Jon Murphy, from the Association of Chief Police Officers, said: ‘While incidents in violence against the person fell, a continued cause for concern was the increase in pickpocketing, robbery and robbery with knives.’ ‘This has been driven by a rise in robberies of personal property and police will want to focus on tackling these offences and offering crime-prevention advice.’ Meanwhile the number of murders and other killings rose by 5 per cent in the year to March 2011, said the Home Office. That is a rise of 28 – taking the total number of violent deaths to 636, up from 608 in 2009/10. The latter includes the 12 victims of the Cumbrian shootings in June 2010 by Derrick Bird. Ministers are set to introduce a ‘tough’ law meaning automatic jail for anyone caught carrying a knife with the intention of using it to commit a crime. Currently just one in five of those caught carrying a knife is given a jail term. The rest are handed community sentences, fines or other punishments. Policing minister Nick Herbert said: ‘Today’s crime figures cannot be used to show there is a long-term change in either direction. There are areas of concern and, as we have consistently said, crime remains too high. ‘We know good policing makes a difference.’ Justice Secretary Ken Clarke has introduced a number of measures to reduce the prison population . Ken Clarke (right) has come under constant attack over his money-saving plans to reduce the prison population by 3,000 by putting fewer offenders behind bars. He stunned the Tory conference in 2010 by announcing he wanted to scrap prison term of less than six months in favour of community sentences. That policy was heavily criticised last month after it emerged a quarter of criminals break their non-custodial punishments. Last year, the Justice Secretary caused outrage by suggesting that some rapes were more serious than others as he attempted to defend proposed shorter jail terms for some rapists. Then last May it was revealed that less than a third of convicted muggers and car thieves end up in jail. Furthermore, just over half of drug dealers go to prison – and only 43 per cent of those who have sex with a child under 13 are put behind bars. The row within the Tory Party itself about the Justice Secretary's approach re-emerged in October when Home Secretary Theresa May and Boris Johnson urged him to extend minimum jail terms to under-18s. However, he dismissed their call. A month later, it emerged that youth courts are jailing just one in four teenage muggers. Most young criminals are facing nothing harsher than rehabilitation, fines or community service. Even during the 'crackdown' over August's riots, the average sentence was well below two years.","Around half of all robberies took place in London .

"By . Mail Foreign Service . Last updated at 7:19 AM on 5th October 2011 . Global power: Vladimir Putin said the new group could compete for influence with the USA, Europe and Asia . Vladimir Putin has raised fears of a revival of the USSR after he revealed plans to create a so-called ‘Eurasian Union’ of former Soviet nations. The Russian prime minister  – who is all but certain to regain the presidency next year – wants the bloc to become ‘one of the poles of the modern world’, and a rival to the United States, the European Union and Asia. In the past, Mr Putin has lamented the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 as the ‘greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century’. But he denies the Kremlin’s proposed new alliance is an attempt to rebuild Russia’s  old communist empire. Instead, Mr Putin – who has effectively led the country for more than a decade, first as president and now as prime minister – claims the union would merely act as ‘an efficient link between Europe and the dynamic Asia-Pacific region’. His assurances will do little to convince some ex-Soviet nations, however, many of whom are already suspicious of the Kremlin’s intentions. Alexander Dugin, a political scholar, said the ‘Eurasian Union’ would become one of Mr Putin’s chief policies as president. He added: ‘From the geopolitical viewpoint it represents an attempt to revive the USSR.’ But announcing the plans in a Russian newspaper, Mr Putin claimed: ‘There is no talk about rebuilding the USSR in one  way or another. It would be naive  to try to restore or copy something that belongs to the past, but a close integration based on new values and economic and political foundation is a demand of the present time.’ Empire-building: Vladimir Putin has mourned the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union . Dominant: A map from 1986 shows the span of the former Soviet Union, which incorporates cities such as Tblisi, Talin and Donetsk, which are now the capital cities of Georgia, Estonia and the Ukraine . Near collapse: Three years later, however, the USSR's borders had retreated . [caption . The concept of Eurasia, the huge area . of land mass comprising Russia and some of its European and North Asian . neighbours, was first featured in George Orwell's dystopian fantasy . 1984. Under Orwell's . vision of a Totalitarian dystopia after the Second World War, the UK . falls into civil war and is integrated to Oceania, a society ruled by . the dictatorship of 'the Party'. At the same time, the USSR annexed continental Europe and created the second superstate of Eurasia. The novel's third state, Eastasia is made of large regions of East Asia and Southeast Asia. The . novel describes the story of Winston Smith, who records how the world's . three superstates are constantly fighting for the unconquered lands of . the world. Smith . recounts the Atomic Wars fought in western Russia, North America and . Europe, and describes how 'the Party' referred to the postwar . reorganisation of society as 'the Revolution'. Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan have . already formed an economic alliance to remove customs barriers between . the countries, and now  Mr Putin is pushing for Kyrgyzstan and . Tajikistan to join, too. In January, the group will adopt unified market rules. He said: ‘We aren’t going to stop at . that and are putting forward an ambitious task of reaching a new, higher . level of integration with the Eurasian Union. ‘Along with other key players and . regional structures, such as the European Union, the United States, . China and the Asia Pacific Economic Community, it should ensure . stability of global development.’ But Mr Putin’s plans are likely to . meet with fierce opposition from some of his prospective ‘Eurasian . Union’ partners, who are far keener to forge closer ties with Europe . than their old communist masters. Last month Ukrainian president Viktor . Yanukovych complained that the Kremlin was trying to coerce his country . into joining the new customs union. And the Russian government has also . caused tensions with Belarus – one of its closest allies – after it . tried to gain a huge stake in its top state-controlled industrial . assets, a move Belarus has strongly resisted. Mr Putin served as Russia’s president . from 2000 to 2008, when he was frequently accused of undoing the former . communist state’s transition to democracy. He only stepped down – to make way . for his protege, Dmitry Medvedev – because rules barred him from serving . a third consecutive term. By becoming prime minister he has . remained Russia’s leader in all but name, and is likely to regain the . presidency in elections next March. Mr Medvedev has already proposed . that he should run .","Proposed alliance between Russia and other nations could be 'one of the poles of the modern world'

YouTube's head of content, Robert Kyncl said in a speech at this year's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas that more Android devices are activated - ie turned on for the first time - than babies are born on Earth. Kyncl joked that Andy Rubin, Google's director of mobile, was now looking for customers on other planets. Rubin said in December last year that 700,000 Android phones were being activated every day. The phones, of course, have an open goal - the birth rate has been dropping steadily since the Eighties, with UN estimates at around the 300,000 mark according to a 2008 study. The birth rate is predicted to drop to 16 million people per year by 2025, from a high of 17 million per year.

A ceremony was held at Baghdad’s heavily-fortified airport to mark the withdrawal of American troops, an estimated 4,500 of whom have died in the conflict. Some 100,000 Iraqis are also thought to have lost their lives. U.S. defence secretary Leon Panetta told his troops they could leave with great pride. ‘After a lot of blood spilled by Iraqis and Americans, the mission of an Iraq that could govern and secure itself has become real,’ he said.

At the sombre occasion, where the . U.S. flag was taken down, he told his audience of a few hundred troops: . ‘No words, no ceremony can provide full tribute to the sacrifices which . have brought this day to pass.’ The conflict began in March 2003 when . George W Bush and Tony Blair launched an invasion across the Kuwaiti . border, ousting Saddam Hussein but failing to find his supposed weapons . of mass destruction.

Under the brutal dictator it was possible to walk the streets of Baghdad and other Iraqi cities in safety – as long as you did not actively oppose his rule. But now there is little security. Violence is rampant, even if it has declined since the terrible sectarian bloodletting in the middle of the last decade. Much as most Iraqis detested the . American invasion and occupation, many fear the security situation will . deteriorate further after the withdrawal of U.S. troops. And despite .

"By . Sadie Whitelocks . Last updated at 6:27 PM on 17th January 2012 . A mother-of-three plagued by illness has told how her problems have been linked to an insect bite suffered 20 years ago. Adelle Huckins, 31, has been blighted by a range of medical conditions including migraines, severe fatigue, sickness, hearing difficulties and a drooping left eye. But it was only last year that she was able to understand the route of her failing health when medics diagnosed her with Lyme Disease, a bacterial infection carried by ticks. Adelle Huckins, who has been plagued by health problems after she was bitten by a tick aged 11, pictured with husband Rob and children Dexter (front) Josh and Kaitlyn . Lyme disease, which Adelle (pictured above) caught, is a vicious infection that attacks the immune system and can cause paralysis, encephalitis and meningitis. It is caused by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi, found in the digestive systems of animals such as mice, pheasants and deer. When a tick bites an animal carrying this bacteria, they can become infected with it. The tick - part of the spider family - can transfer the bacteria to a human by biting and attaching itself to a person's skin for days. Lyme disease is transmitted only if the tick remains attached for more than 36 hours. Although you may think it easy to tell if a tick was on your body, they are only a few millimetres in size and do not hurt, so are easy to miss. While the Health Protection Agency estimates that there are fewer than 2,000 cases of Lyme disease a year in the UK, it is on the rise. The first symptom is a red circular skin rash, which subsides after a week or two. A high temperature, muscle pain and joint swelling are then symptoms. She suddenly remembered a school trip to Germany in 1991 when she was 11-years-old, during which she was bitten on the leg by a tick. Despite the bite . causing a rash she thought nothing of it, but now she believes it is . responsible for years of poor health, which have made her feel like she . has the body of 'a 90-year-old'. Mrs Huckins,  of New Marske, Cleveland said: 'I . was never the same after coming home from that trip. I couldn’t get . better afterwards but they couldn’t find what was wrong with me. 'I had lots of symptoms but they were . put down to other things. But when I found out about Lyme Disease, it . was like a jigsaw puzzle fitting together at last. 'I'm 31 but can feel like I’m in a 90-year-old's body.' For years medics were baffled by her catalogue of illnesses but it was only when she chanced upon . Lyme Disease on the internet last year that she realised it could hold . the key to her health problems. A basic NHS test came back negative, so Mrs Huckins turned to the Nuffield Hospital in Newcastle upon Tyne where results, sent off to a U.S. specialist, proved positive. Now Mrs Huckins fears for her husband Rob's health as Lyme could potentially be passed through sexual contact. She also worries about her children . Joshua, nine, Kaitlyn, six and Dexter, 18 months, although there is no . conclusive evidence that Lyme can be passed to babies through pregnancy. In the meantime antibiotics have helped ease her range of symptoms. She added: 'I just want to put out a warning for people to be cautious when they’re out in  the countryside. 'A simple bite can turn your world upside down.' Family and friends are now fundraising to enable the Huckins family to get tested and undergo necessary treatment.","Adelle Huckins blighted by migraines, nausea and fatigue .

A clock collector was eagerly awaiting the delivery of an antique cuckoo timepiece from Pennsylvania, tracking each step of its progress toward his Hollywood home and counting down the minutes before he could hang it in his above his mantle. But much to his horror, footage from security cameras Michael Oreb installed showed an impatient U.S. postal worker briefly checking the gate, and then hurling it over the fence into Mr Oreb’s front yard. This comes a month after a string of delivery men came under fire for carelessly handling packages, and amidst dire times for the United States Postal Service. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Neither snow nor fence: A Hollywood-area postal worker was caught on camera throwing a valuable cuckoo clock over its owner's security gate . Going postal: The mail delivery man hurls the precious poster over the fence... Deliver and run: ...and speeds off after throwing the parcel over the gate . Mr Oreb, who had installed security cameras only a week ago, witnessed the moment the postal worker threw his precious package over the gate, apparently because he couldn’t get it open after one go. ‘I looked and he pulled up, threw it (the box) over the fence, and then got in the van and drove off,’ he told NBC Los Angeles. Though Mr Oreb immediately went out to confront the postal worker, the delivery man had already sped off. Afraid to look: The box was thrown high over the fence and, despite the bubble wrap, suffered some damage . Damaged goods: Owner Michael Oreb shows off the 1938 German cuckoo clock. After it was dropped, the chains no longer work and the second hand is bent . He told the website that he knew his antique clock was going to be damaged based on the way it was thrown. Upon inspection, the chains were broken, the second hand was bent and loose, and there could be more damage still. Mr Oreb said every generation in his family has owned a German Black Forest cuckoo clock, and he was looking forward to continuing the legacy. He decided to call and complain to USPS and said within ten minutes of phoning in, a representative was at his door. Tick tock: Michael Oreb says collecting cuckoo clocks has been a family hobby for generations . Though the representative offered to take the clock for repairs, Mr Oreb wanted to hang onto it. He said: ‘I will take it in and find me a repairman who works on antique clocks and have them repair it and I’ll send them the bill.’ In response to the video showing the careless employee, USPS released a statement saying they were ‘dismayed’ to see the video. 'I will take it in and find me a repairman who works on antique clocks and have them repair it and I’ll send them the bill.' -Clock owner Michael Oreb . They said: ‘That does not represent the kind of service we strive to provide our customers,’ adding the incident is currently under investigation so they can take ‘appropriate actions’ regarding the clock-thrower. Mr Oreb told NBC Los Angeles that he doesn’t think the man should lose his job. ‘I think he should be reprimanded, maybe put through some more training and stuff like that, ‘cause you never know what’s inside the packages when you see them.’ Not so precious cargo: In December, a FedEx delivery man tossed a Samsung computer monitor over a fence . Going viral: The footage of the apathetic deliveryman became an internet sensation and even sparked a parody by Conan O'Brien . The cameras, he said, were for his wife’s peace of mind. They have only been living in their northern Hollywood home for seven months, and she felt safer knowing things were being monitored. The bad image comes at a time when the Postal Service needs all the good news it can get. The service has lost over $25billion since the 2006 fiscal year, forecasting a dismal $14billion loss in 2012.

"Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey breached Commons rules . By . Jason Groves . Last updated at 10:56 AM on 20th January 2012 . Shamed: Jack Dromey (pictured with wife Harriet Harman) breached Commons rules for failing to declare payments totaling almost £60,000 . A senior Labour MP was forced to apologise to the Commons yesterday after secretly accepting almost £60,000 in payments from the trade union Unite. A parliamentary sleaze inquiry found Jack Dromey, who is married to deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman, committed a serious breach of Commons rules by failing to declare a financial relationship with the union – Labour’s biggest donor – for more than a year. Mr Dromey, 63, is Ed Miliband’s shadow housing minister and served for years as Labour’s treasurer, as well as holding a string of senior positions during a 32-year career in the trade union movement. But Mr Dromey was let off with a slap on the wrist after a committee of MPs ruled he was a ‘new and inexperienced MP’. After his election in May 2010, Mr Dromey said he was resigning as Unite’s deputy general secretary and had ‘declined my salary in the meantime’. In fact, he continued to work for the union part time, charging up to £200 an hour for several months. Mr Dromey was paid more than £28,000 in wages until he finally stopped working for the union in October 2010. The following month he was also given a £30,000 pay-off. He also had the use of a union-funded car, which he bought at a discount on leaving. But despite strict rules on the declaration of outside income, none of these payments was made public until October the following year. Embarrassment: Mrs Harman, Labour's deputy leader, will have caused party leader Miliband, right, unnecessary distress . Mr Dromey also breached rules by . failing to mention his relationship with Unite in two Commons debates in . which the union had an interest. The Commons Standards and Privileges . Committee said yesterday it would accept Mr Dromey’s written apology but . suggested it would have demanded a tougher penalty had he not been ‘a . new and inexperienced MP at the time’. The ruling raised eyebrows yesterday at Westminster, where Mr Dromey is widely viewed as a seasoned operator. He told a sleaze inquiry into the . affair that he had genuinely intended not to accept any more payments . from Unite after being elected – and even went so far as to send back a . salary cheque. But he said the union had then asked him to carry out some work on a sensitive ‘internal matter’. He claimed he never got round to . registering the payments because he was ‘extremely busy’. But he . admitted he had ‘no explanation’ for why he had failed to check his . entry in the register of MPs’ interests for almost a year. Yesterday Mr Dromey made a brief apology in the Commons. He said the failure to register the payments had been ‘unintentional’. He added: ‘Notwithstanding that the . commissioner and the committee noted that the breaches were . unintentional, I want to apologise unreservedly to the House and I will . in future fully abide by the rules of the House.’ Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, who . complained to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards about Mr . Dromey’s failure to register union payments, said: ‘It is right that . Jack Dromey’s serious  misconduct has been investigated and condemned. ‘Ed Miliband can talk all he likes . about taking on the unions, but unless he publicly reprimands his shadow . minister’s misconduct, people will see him for what he is – weak and in . the pockets of his union paymasters.’","Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey breached Commons rules .

'Sarah sustained serious injuries and remains intubated and sedated in critical condition,' said Dr. Safdar Ansari, who is treating her. The nature of her injuries has not yet been disclosed. Witnesses said that the accident at the Park City Mountain resort, initially did not appear to be that serious. 'She landed a trick down in the bottom end of the pipe, and kind of bounced, from her feet to her head,' Peter Judge, the CEO of Canada's freestyle skiing program, told the Toronto Globe and Mail newspaper. 'It wasn't anything that looked like a catastrophic fall, so I'm a bit mystified.' She was on the same halfpipe where snowboarder Kevin Pearce suffered traumatic brain injury after a near-fatal fall on December 31, 2009. Burke's husband, freestyle skier Rory Bushfield, was with other family members at the hospital and wanted to express thanks for well wishes coming in from around the world.

Regulator Ofcom has been carrying out a consultation aimed at giving greater commercial freedom to Royal Mail, including handing the firm the power to set the price of first class stamps. Sky high: Royal Mail have demanded the right to charge people as much as they want to send a letter . It is proposing a cap on second class . stamps of between 45p and 55p, but Royal Mail has confirmed it wants . them to be at the upper end of the scale. Ofcom said its proposals, announced . in October, were aimed at protecting the universal service obligation . (USO) under which the Royal Mail has to deliver to any address in the UK . for the same price, six days a week. It has been under pressure in recent . years because of falling mail volumes, which has seen the number of . letters delivered every day slump by 22 million to 62 million between . 2006 and 2010, contributing towards a loss of £120million last year. Consumers have also switched from . first to second class mail - now posted in equal numbers - while stamp . prices have lagged behind inflation for almost 20 years. Soaring: The price of a first class stamp has risen from 27p in 2000 to 46p today . The price of a first class stamp in . the UK is among the lowest in Europe at 46p, compared with 69p in Italy, . 67p in Denmark and 60p in Greece, while service targets are among the . highest, Ofcom pointed out. The Federation of Small Businesses said . it has ‘extreme concerns that the small business community will . disproportionately suffer under the new reforms.’ Yesterday Royal Mail insisted it must be able to charge as much as it likes for a first or second class stamp. In . a decision which will trigger outrage among its customers, the . State-owned company wrote to Britain’s postal regulator insisting . all the current price caps, should be scrapped. The . letter, seen by the Daily Mail, states clearly: ‘Royal Mail does not . believe that the case is strong for the imposition of a price cap on any . of our products.’ The letter states that, if Ofcom insists . on a price cap, that it ‘should be set at the upper end of Ofcom’s . proposed range (ie 55p.)’ It went on to say that it believes there is . ‘no affordability concern’ for Britain’s cash-strapped households. The campaign group, Consumer Focus, . has already raised its concerns about Ofcom’ s proposals, which it fears . could lead to ‘steep price rises for customers.’ A spokesman said: ‘In the worst case . it could result in a financially troubled Royal Mail, which remained in . public hands, imposing higher and higher prices on its dwindling . customer base and with its modernisation programme mired in industrial . relation problems.’ Other . responses to Ofcom’s consultation, which were published yesterday, raise . major concerns about how small businesses will cope with future price . hikes. Clive Davenport, . chairman of the federation’s trade unit, warned: ‘In the worst case . scenario, they may be priced out of the market with no suitable postal . competitor to switch to.’ The Forum of Private Business said ‘no-limit increases’ in stamp prices will ‘harm’ small business. Jane Bennett, head of campaigns, said: ‘It would simply create another cost barrier to trading for small firms reliant on postal services who can ill afford further price hikes. ‘We understand that Royal Mail is currently a loss-making organisation and action needs to be taken to address this. ‘But we believe constant price rises are not the way to tackle the issue.’ She added: ‘During the difficult economic climate, we believe it is unjustifiable for Royal Mail to increase its prices by large amounts without check.’ Latest figures show Royal Mail’s UK letters and parcels division lost £41million between March and September last year. Royal Mail insists it would not raise stamp prices dramatically because such a move would drive away customers, which is the corporate equivalent of shooting itself in the foot. A spokesman for Ofcom, which is expected to publish its final decision in March, said: ‘Our proposals seek to ensure that UK consumers continue to benefit from the universal one-price-goes-anywhere postal service. ‘We will consider all consultation responses and aim to publish a statement in the spring.’","Price of second class stamps has almost doubled from 19p in 2000 to 36p today .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:20 PM on 20th January 2012 . Police in the US have charged a man with murder of a 26-year-old woman whose drowning in 2003 was initially ruled an accident. Daniel U. Perez, 52, appeared in court via a video link from the Sedgwick County jail in Wichita, Kansas, on 39 criminal counts, including rape, child sexual exploitation, and the premeditated murder of Patricia Hughes. Court documents indicate that Perez and Ms Hughes were living with a group of people in central Kansas that has now been linked to several deaths. Daniel U. Perez, 52, appeared in court via video link yesterday having been charged with the murder in 2003 of 26-year-old Patricia Hughes. Investigators initially believed the 26-year-old mother accidentally drowned while trying to rescue her 2-year-old daughter from a swimming pool at a home in  Valley Center, a city just north of Wichita, where the group was living at the time. But last September Ms Hughes' death was reclassified as murder amid evidence that the group was living off life insurance policies. The group of people lived together in at least three different states, either in one large home or in houses in close proximity, and was living in Valley Center at the time of Hughes' death, according to Martin Bauer, the lawyer for Ms Hughes' parents, who were recently granted legal guardianship of their now 11-year-old granddaughter. Two criminal complaints unsealed on Thursday show that Perez is facing numerous charges, including one count of sexual exploitation of an 8-year-old child and 11 counts each of rape and sodomy. He also is charged with making a criminal threat as well as several counts each of aggravated assault involving a rifle and making false statements to obtain credit from a Wichita car dealership. He also is accused of making false statements on life insurance applications in 2006. The girl's maternal grandparents won custody in 2010, after federal and state investigators alerted them that the child could be in 'imminent danger'. 'There is a pattern that members of a group associated with the person using the name of Lou Castro have followed of insuring members of the group and then living off the proceeds of the life insurance policies when one of them dies,' Mr Bauer wrote in a July 2010 filing seeking custody for the grandparents. The judge found that the girl was in 'imminent danger' and granted the maternal grandparents guardianship. Filings in that guardianship case in Kansas indicate detectives told the grandparents in 2010 that the man they knew as Lou Castro was in fact Perez, who had been convicted of sex crimes with a child in the 1990s but had fled before sentencing. Investigators also told the grandparents about the federal case filed against Perez in Kansas for aggravated identity theft. In that case, he was listed at the same address in Tennessee, more than 800 miles from Kansas, where their granddaughter was living at the time. Sedgwick County District Judge Warren Wilbert yesterday set bond at US$2 million pending a preliminary hearing on 2 February. The charges were initially filed in September but they were kept under seal while Perez finished serving a federal sentence for identity theft in Oklahoma before being extradited to Kansas to face the state charges. Perez's court-appointed attorney, Alice Osburn, did not immediately return a call from The Associated Press for comment.","U.S. woman's drowning originally ruled accidental .

"By . Damien Gayle . Last updated at 5:45 PM on 19th January 2012 . The future of the world's timekeeping could be set to change if a U.S. led coalition is able to force through a proposal to abolish the leap seconds that keep clocks in line with the Earth's rotation. Currently an extra second is added every few years to keep the time measured by atomic clocks synchronised with time as measured by the position of the sun in the sky. But there are now calls for these leap seconds to be abolished in favour of a man-made standard of time some say is more precise in an electronic age. Delegates to the International Telecommunication Union  have set their alarms for the beginning of a meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, this afternoon where the proposals will be debated. Under threat: The U.S. wants to move to a new man-made standard of time that disregards the position of the sun in the sky, rendering sundials useless . Opponents, including experts from the UK and China, say such a change would mean time shifting out of sync with people's everyday experience of night and day. David Willetts, Minister of State for Universities and Science, told the BBC: 'The UK position is that we should stick to the current system used throughout the world. 'Without leap seconds we will eventually lose the link between time and people's everyday experience of day and night.' Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) has, since the Seventies, been the agreed universal standard which dictates what time it is in every time zone on the planet. UTC is kept by averaging the time from 400 atomic clocks on earth and sometimes differs from time dictated by day and night, due to fluctuations in earth's rotation. Atomic clocks measure time to incredibly precise accuracy by measuring vibrations caused by the decay of radioactive particles to count the seconds. The speed of the Earth's rotation varies, however, meaning that while one rotation is one day, some days are a few milliseconds longer or shorter than others. Scientists allow for these fluctuations by adding leap seconds roughly every year-and-a-half to keep UTC synchronised with our traditional, sun-based concept of time. They are added once the International Earth Rotation Service, which monitors the planet's activity, finds the two measurements of time have drifted apart by 0.9 seconds. Outdated: Supporters of the reforms say that a man-made absolute time system would be more useful in an age of GPS and electronic communication . But that tiny difference could be disastrous, according to Dr Felicitas Arias, head of the time department at International Bureau of Weights and Measures in Paris. The France-based bureau aggregates the readings from atomic clocks worldwide and issues the results to timekeepers around the world. Dr Arias told the New Scientist last month: 'It is vital for global navigation satellite systems such as GPS to have a continuous time scale, not UTC with its leap seconds. 'That means there is a 15-second difference between UTC and the time GPS uses. Someone who is unaware of this could make a tragic mistake when landing an aircraft, for instance. This could happen.' 'And a one-second difference in the communication between stock exchanges could provoke a gain or loss of millions of dollars.' But supporters of leap seconds, like Peter Whibberley, senior researcher in time and frequency at the National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, say the problems they cause do not justify getting rid of them. He told the BBC abolishing them would be 'perhaps the most fundamental change to timekeeping for hundreds of years.' 'For the first time, civil time worldwide would be based purely on man-made clocks and no longer tied closely to the Earth's rotation,' he said. Intuitive: The position in the sun in the sky has, for millenia, been mankind's established method of determining the time . As a result of such a discrepancy in just a few decades the difference between Earth-based time and atomic clock time would amount to several minutes. Over 500 years the two standards of time would be out by as much as an hour. Over millenia, the discrepancy could grow to such an extent midday would fall in the middle of the night. It is not the first time the U.S. has campaigned against leap seconds. In 2005 American experts proposed that they be replaced with a leap hour, but ITU members rejected the plan. If agreement over the time keeping proposal cannot be reached among the ITU's 200 member states, the issue will go to a vote. A 70 per cent majority would be needed for leap seconds to be abolished. If they are, the change would come into force from January 1, 2018. █ The UK's atomic clock, based at the National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, has been judged to be the most accurate in the world. U.S. researchers from Pennsyvania State University last summer found it wouldn't stray by more than a second in 138million years.","Leap seconds added to allow for Earth's rotation .

"By . Becky Barrow . Last updated at 10:57 PM on 18th January 2012 . London bankers at Goldman Sachs are in line for a pay and bonus pot of £1.5billion, despite a fall in profits. With Britain in the grip of a recession, the announcement will only add to public fury over City payouts. The company, which is awarding its workers £8.2billion globally, has 5,300 staff based in Britain. Business Secretary Vince Cable said: 'These pay awards reflect a basic lack of reality about the world we now live in. The company, which is awarding its workers £8.2billion globally, has 5,300 staff based in Britain . 'The concern is that it could have a knock-on effect throughout the banking sector at exactly the time the Government and businesses are urging restraint.' Goldman is paying out an average of £238,000 in salary, bonuses and equity awards to its approximate 30,000 staff globally for their efforts in 2011. This is down from an average £280,000 the previous year. David Viniar, . Goldman's finance director, insisted that 'discretionary' bonuses were down 'considerably more than . revenues' during the year. The news comes despite disappointing annual results from the investment bank. Goldman Sachs (nicknamed the 'Vampire Squid' as its tentacles stretch far and wide) revealed profits fell to £1.95billion last year, from £5.5billion in 2010. This would make it its second lowest annual profit in almost ten years, reflecting the impact Europe's debt crisis is having on the Wall Street bank. The total pot this year is £1.8billion less than the £10billion awarded for their efforts the previous year. Occupy London protesters outside St Paul's making a stand against corporate greed . The dip in profits also underlines the struggle the bank, under chief executive Lloyd Blankfein, is facing from new regulations. The Volcker Rule, due to come into force in July, bans banks from gambling with their own money and limits the amount of capital they can invest in hedge funds and private equity investments. Former banker William Cohan said: 'I think a firm like Goldman has real problems. 'Some of the lines they've been traditionally strong in are being regulated out of existence,' he told The Daily Telegraph. Goldman is axing 1,000 jobs and cutting £780million in costs by the middle of the year to protect profits. However, it may take some solace in the fact it topped the mergers and acquisitions league table in the UK, consulting on deals worth £76.5billion. A protester waves a sign outside Goldman Sachs's New York HQ . Preparing for 'doughnut' bonuses . The bars around London's finance district may soon start filling up with bankers fresh from pay discussions, but not many will be there to splash their bonus cash. This year zero bonuses, known as 'doughnuts', will affect even senior staff and could include a bigger proportion of employees than in the 2008 financial crisis, bankers and headhunters predicted as U.S. firms start telling bankers this week what they will get. Slumping quarterly profits, a darkening long-term outlook for the industry and unrelenting pressure from politicians and an angry public, are pushing bank bosses to break away from a culture in which most staff expect a bonus every year and base their personal budget around it. 'This will probably be the worst year for zero bonuses we've seen, although those that will have done well will still get something,' said Jason Kennedy, who runs recruiting firm Kennedy Group. 'Global heads and senior managing directors are among those that will get nothing -- they're the expensive staff, and they'll be living off their higher salaries.' Underperforming bankers already came under pressure in the 2010 bonus round as 'doughnuts' multiplied, but this time division heads are raising the bar and reserving payouts for an even smaller group of star bankers. Bonuses would be down at least 30 per cent for those that do get one, Kennedy said, while other recruiters predict cuts of up to 70 per cent in some areas, such as bond trading. Bankers at Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan and Citi are among those expecting to hear about their bonuses this week, coinciding with these firms' fourth quarter results. Overall pay at JP Morgan's investment bank came in at $8.8billion, down 9 per cent on 2010 levels, while total revenues for the year were flat, its filings showed last week. Bonuses at RBS could total as much as £500million . The rise of 'doughnuts' will not mean the end to bonuses or to public anger over payouts. At . government-controlled banks like Britain's Royal Bank of Scotland, . where bonuses are likely to total £400-500million, according to sources and company reports, these rewards are . still under fire. 'It's extremely difficult to justify any bonus . at all at a state-owned bailed-out bank,' Tory MP Steve Baker said. Baker joined about 40 . anti-capitalist protesters from the 'Occupy London' movement in a . gathering outside the offices of Britain's financial watchdog last week, . condemning excessive executive pay. Ahead of this year's bonus . season, the British government has also moved to clamp down on rewards . by suggesting shareholders should get a veto on pay. As scrutiny . of investment banks' pay practices mounts, many are already taking . their own steps to amend the structure of rewards, beyond just cutting . them. Morgan Stanley will reportedly tell employees this week . that cash payouts will be capped at £80,000 ($125,000), with any portion received . above this deferred until at least the end of the year. Top management . might defer their entire bonuses for 2012. Antonio Horta-Osorio, the boss of taxpayer-backed Lloyds Banking Group, revealed last week that he would not take his annual bonus for last year . 'Whiter than white' senior bankers . Since 2009, salaries have often doubled for top investment bankers, to around £350,000 ($536,500) on average, according to recruiters' estimates. This was after firms tried to find ways around a bonus tax in Britain and tougher rules on rewards across Europe. It put additional pressure on bonus pots, through which firms still have some leverage to cut pay costs. Senior bankers in charge of bonus decisions for their teams have been talking tough about pay for months, preparing staff for lower payouts by pointing to the thousands of jobs being cut across the industry and to the rise in salaries. 'We've got to be realistic. We're not talking hardship here,' said a division head at one major U.S. firm. 'There is a psychological impact when you don't get a bonus - it used to mean you're not doing well and could be let go. 'It doesn't make the [bonus] conversation very easy, but this year there will be strength in numbers.' Many expect these senior bankers to be among those to forgo big payouts, partly as a move to appease disgruntled staff. 'They have to be seen to be whiter than white, and not to be necessarily paying themselves but the performers in their teams,' said Jonathan Evans, chairman of headhunters Sammons Associates. Last week, the boss of Lloyds Banking Group forfeited a £2.4million bonus for 2011, saying he wants to share the . pain being suffered by ordinary people. António . Horta-Osório, who returned to work this month after treatment at the . Priory clinic for exhaustion, said his bonus should reflect ‘the tough . financial circumstances that many people are facing’. But . the 47-year-old Portuguese executive could still earn up to £10million . for 2011, thanks to a ‘golden handshake’ awarded to compensate him for . benefits lost when he left Santander UK to join Lloyds.","Workers receive average of £238,000 .

"One 20-month-reported dead and his mother missing in Oregon creek after massive flash rainstorm, another man fatally hit by falling tree in Seattle . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 7:10 AM on 20th January 2012 . Three people have died, tens of thousands lost power, and hundreds of cars slid off roads a today after the Pacific Northwest was hit with a major snowfall. The storm claimed the lives of a mother and her one-year-old son, their bodies pulled from an Oregon creek after their car was swept from a grocery store parking lot and a person killed by a falling tree east of Seattle. Rescuers were searching yesterday for the Oregon child's mother, who was missing in the creek in the Willamette Valley community of Albany, about 70 miles south of Portland. She was later found dead. Sudden and serious rainfall in Oregon has left a 20-month old child dead and his mother missing . Winter storm warning: Seattle was hit with snow and, more unusually, frozen rain, which hasn't happened since 1996 . Washington Governor Chris Gregoire declared a state of emergency, authorizing the use of National Guard troops if necessary. On . the icy interstate north of Seattle, a transportation department worker . responding to an accident was injured in crash. He was taken to a . Seattle hospital; no details were available on his condition or how he . was injured. Freezing . rain and ice pellets caused numerous accidents in the Seattle area, . where drivers are mostly inexperienced with driving in snow or ice. The . last widespread freezing rain in Seattle was in December 1996. Oregon didn't receive the snowfall that Washington did – but got plenty of rain. The worst appears to be over for the Pacific Northwest as the storm heads to the Northeast overnight . Headed across country: Chicagp, New York, and Boston are among the cities due to be hit tonight and tomorrow . Rising water from heavy rains swept a car carrying four people into an overflowing creek in Albany. Two . people – a father and his 5-year-old son – escaped, but the body of . 20-month-old Aiden McLaughlin was recovered and his mother, Catherine . McLaughlin, was still missing. ‘The water just got high so fast,’ said Portland fire department spokeswoman Wanda Omdahl. ‘It's a big tragedy.’ The . damage is not limited to the northwest, however, as four central states . on reported tornadoes, the National Weather Service said. A . cold front combined with a warm and humid air mass contributed to the . unseasonable twisters which were also spotted in Tennessee, Indiana and . Mississippi, Dan Pydynowski, senior meteorologist at AccuWeather.com . said. Dangerous roads: Officials have said that hundreds of drivers have gone off the sides of roads due to ice and snow . Frosty: In Canada, temperatures have dropped to -40C, shown in the photo of Alberta above . Damages reported from the twisters have been mostly to buildings, vehicles, power lines and trees . while one injury was reported in Mississippi where a person suffered a . possible broken arm after the tornado struck their home. Around the unseasonable central states' weather, the Pacific . Northwest is receiving its own pummel of 100mph winds and near-record . snowfall in some areas Wednesday stacking up to 16in. Sheltering from the winter weather in . the north east, parts of Oregon have seen winds reach as high as . 110mph, bringing much of the region to a standstill. From . the Washington state capital in Olympia to the Oregon coast, schools . were closed, roads were clogged with snow and hundreds of accidents and . dozens of flights were cancelled. Snowed in: Snow blankets cars and homes in Tacoma, Washington . Hitting hard: State troopers in the northwest reported 95 accidents in eight hours in what many residents dubbed 'Snowmageddon' while central states dodged 10 tornadoes . Cary Rheder of Newcastle, Washington, shovels snow off his car in downtown Bellevue while on his way to work . In an eight-hour period near the capital, there were 95 accidents, mostly spin outs, according to a state trooper. The storm, nicknamed 'Snowmageddon' as . it approached the Puget Sound region, proved less extreme than . originally forecast, with the National Weather Service lowering its . outlook for possible snow accumulations from up to ten inches to around . six inches, meteorologist Dustin Guy said. ‘If . you get off the beaten path, you're in deep trouble,’ State Trooper Guy . Gill said. ‘I saw a guy in my rear mirror. I saw headlights and tail . lights and headlights and tail lights again as he spun around off the . road.’ ‘For the first time in my career, I had to put chains on,’ he said. ‘You stay in the path laid down on the freeway.’ Making the best of it: Many schools in Washington and Oregon were given a snow day Thursday . Wreching havoc: Landslides occurred on roads in Tacoma, Washington due to the heavy rain and hail . Forecasters expect ‘good old rain back Friday and Saturday.' But . warmer weather could lead to icy conditions, and Seattle officials . urged people to find and clear street storm drains that could get . clogged and cause severe flooding. Olympia . had about a foot of new snow on the ground by 7.30am. The city could . break its record of 14in of snow in a 24-hour period, Mr Colman said. Areas south of Olympia could get 20in. ‘They're getting hammered,’ Mr . Colman said. Tacoma had . about seven inches of snow for the morning rush hour. Seattle had . compact snow and ice on roads for commuters. Lesser amounts were . reported north of Seattle.

Not all bad: Seattle residents Joe Moore (right) and Sam Clement, both 12, take advantage of the winter white in Maple Leaf Park . Southeast Washington also is getting a good shot of snow with six to ten inches expected in the Palouse, meteorologist Colby Neuman said. ‘This will be right up with the most snow this season,’ Mr Neuman said. ‘This has been an un-snowy winter.' High winds have begun hammering parts . of the Oregon coast and causing power outages, with reports of gusts of . 100mph and more. There were no immediate reports of serious damage. Heavy snow has been falling in Washington's mountains with up to two feet of fresh snow expected by Thursday. Interstate 90 across Snoqualmie Pass was shut down for much of Tuesday for avalanche control work. Washington residents had plenty of . warning as snow showers started over the weekend. With the heavy snow in . sight, Seattle and other school districts cancelled classes in advance. Wacky way to weather the weather: Seattle-area resident Jamshid Khajavi sees the heavy snowfall as an opportunity to ski cross-country from his home in Kirkland to Bellevue, Washington, a 20 miles round-trip . Lovely night for a stroll: A winter snow inspires Lincoln neighborhood residents to take an early morning walk in Vancouver, Washington . Alaska Airlines . announced late Tuesday that it cancelled 38 flights into and out of . Seattle and Portland, Oregon, Several downtown Seattle hotels reported all . their rooms were booked. Elsewhere, . shoppers stocked up on groceries. Many courts and government offices . and libraries closed. Garbage collection was postponed. Senator Patty .

Hansen and her 17-year-old daughter, Emily, were taking photos of the . growing piles of snow outside the Capitol in Olympia Wednesday morning. ‘I . love it,’ said Emily Hansen, who had the day off because Olympia High . School was closed, along with most other schools in the region. Her . mom's enthusiasm was more measured. ‘A day or two it's fun, but after a . while you start looking at accidents and slush and flooding,’ she said. Tricky navigation: A pedestrian makes his way through snowy streets in Seattle. Many of the city's schools cancelled class preemptively . White out: A United Airlines passenger plane was de-iced at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport during the storm. Some flights were cancelled and many delayed because of the snow and cold temperatures . It was business as usual at the Capitol, where committee hearings were still being held, if not fully attended. Some state employees drove into work, but others walked in, and at least one employee was seen cross-country skiing to the Capitol campus. The 60-day legislative session began on January 9. The governor could declare a state of emergency if conditions worsen, Reuters reports.

"By . Chris Brooke . Last updated at 1:23 AM on 21st January 2012 . Misconduct: Dr Ruth Coppard, pictured arriving at an earlier hearing, tried to block a father's bid for custody of his daughter by falsely stating he had autism . A child psychologist who has featured as an expert on BBC’s Woman’s Hour tried to stop a father winning custody of his teenage daughter by falsely claiming he was autistic, a disciplinary panel was told yesterday. Dr Ruth Coppard told officers involved in family court proceedings that Ian Watson had Asperger’s syndrome, despite having no evidence to back the claim. As well as Radio 4, Coppard has appeared on the Richard and Judy show and featured in other media. She was found guilty of misconduct by the Health Professions Council in London yesterday after six out of seven allegations against her were found proved. The panel also ruled that her fitness to practice was impaired. The allegations included informing a family court officer that Mr Watson had Asperger’s syndrome – a form of autism – ‘without providing any evidence to substantiate your conclusion’. Coppard, an NHS psychologist who is based in Barnsley, had also diagnosed the teenage girl as having the same autistic spectrum disorder. She made damaging comments about them both in a report commissioned by Mr Watson’s ex-wife in November 2008 and a second report for the family GP four months later. Coppard admitted she ‘crossed the line’ by helping Mr Watson’s former wife and taking her side in the custody dispute. She told the hearing: ‘I may have been seduced by the mother’s request, but I really believed it was important for people to understand the extent of her difficulties.’ Mr Watson said he had attended treatment sessions with his ex-wife and daughter but had never himself been assessed for any condition. He claimed Coppard’s report misused confidential information, which left his daughter feeling ‘cross and emotional’. ‘I don’t believe at any time in her life she’s going to have the confidence to talk about her feelings with anyone like that again,’ he said. ‘I went there in good faith and revealed my thoughts and feelings. What I said was added to a long list of failings that were mentioned in court as evidence to why I wasn’t fit to have custody of my two children.’ Coppard made the claims about Mr Watson two years after treating his 14-year-old daughter for an eating disorder. She even contacted the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service to make sure they took her opinions into consideration. She admitted breaching patient confidentiality, but insisted she believed it was in the teenager’s best interests. She conceded: ‘There are a number of things I should have done differently.’ Panel chairman Jacki Pearce said Coppard ‘conducted herself in a manner that fell short of a registered psychologist’. She was given an 18-month condition of practice order, which means she will work under supervision and undergo training.","Dr Ruth Coppard has featured as an expert on Radio 4 show Woman's Hour .

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . Last updated at 6:12 PM on 20th January 2012 . Thames Water: Almost nine per cent of the holding company that owns the water and sewerage firm was bought by the Chinese . The Chinese government has bought nearly 10per cent of Britain’s biggest water company in a move that could signal an economic revolution. It is the first of many investments in the UK’s infrastructure and business sectors that are predicted to transform the nation’s commercial DNA. Projects as diverse as a new London airport in the Thames Estuary to vast new wind farms, nuclear power plants, the High Speed 2 rail line and a new super sewer for London will be trying to attract investment from the Chinese. Separately, house builders, tech . companies and manufacturers, who are struggling to borrow from UK banks, . will be vying for a slice of the ‘Peking Pound’. China’s sovereign wealth fund is buying 8.7per cent of Thames Water in a deal that could be worth £1billion. The fund is fabulously wealthy, with reserves running to £300billion, which the Chinese government is keen to invest overseas. However, the idea of an arm of a Communist Chinese government – albeit one that is adopting a more capitalist and consumer-led approach – owning a stake in a key strategic businesses is controversial. Man on a trade mission: Chancellor George Osborne addresses the Asian Financial Forum in Hong Kong earlier this week. It is unlikely that nations such as the US, Germany and France would contemplate foreign businesses or governments owning their infrastructure. A TV poll by Sky News found 90per cent of people are opposed to Thames Water being foreign owned. However, advocates insist that Britain will benefit from the promised Chinese investment that will fuel economic growth and create jobs. The Chancellor, George Osborne, welcomed the  announcement saying: ‘This is a significant step by China. It is a vote of confidence in Britain as a place to invest and do business. ‘This investment is good news for both the British and Chinese economies.’ Good news: Former Trade Minister Lord Digby Jones welcomed the investment by the Chinese. The former Trade Minister Lord Digby Jones said the investment was good news. But he said it was wrong that British companies do not have the same freedom to invest around the world. Speaking to the BBC Today programme, he said: ‘There are two worries. Everyone praises Britain for having an open market, including the Chinese, but it is not quite a level playing field. ‘I don’t think you would find the Germans doing this, or the French or the Americans.’ Lord Jones said pressure should be put on other countries to open up their economies to allow British business to expand around the globe. The sovereign wealth fund is run by China Investment Corporation (CIC). It announced the purchase of the stake in Thames Water in a one line sentence. The company did not reveal the price paid, however its stake in Thames Water, which has 14 million customers across London and the south, is thought to be worth more than £1billion. The CIC chairman Lou Jiwei announced plans in November to invest in European and US infrastructure, beginning in Britain. The plans are part of a drive to spur global growth and so underpin the demand among western consumers for Chinese goods. CIC was created to invest abroad in the hope of earning a better return on a portion of China's £2trillion in foreign reserves. Mr Lou has made clear that the fund's investments are made on commercial rather than political grounds and are aimed at making a profit. Huge investments funds: Shanghai's Pudong skyline underlines the massive scale of the superpower's economy which has given them the cash to buy into firms like Thames Water . The decision to invest in Thames Water follows Mr Osborne’s return earlier this week from a visit to China. During the trip, he  outlined plans to make London the international centre for trading in the Chinese currency, the Renminbi,  which could be worth billions to the City and the wider economy. Thames Water, once publicly-owned, has gone through several foreign hands since privatisation in 1989. It was owned by RWE of Germany for many years before being sold to a consortium called Kemble Water, headed by the Australian bank Macquarie. In December, another huge sovereign wealth fund, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, bought 9.9per cent of Kemble. It is an attractive investment because profits are effectively guaranteed by a regime that allows price rises every year. Fury: Protestors made their feelings plain after it had been agreed that Cadbury would be subject to a £11.5billion takeover from US giant Kraft worth. Abu Dhabi: The sovereign state fund sovereign wealth fund, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, bought 9.9per cent of Thames Water holding company Kemble in December. Chinese entrepreneurs have already made tentative steps into buying British businesses. For example, Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings, which is run by Asia’s richest man, Li Ka-shing, bought Northumbrian Water in August for £2.4billion. Other famous names to fall into Chinese hands include MG Rover and Volvo. Last year a Chinese food company made an unsuccessful approach to buy United Biscuits, home to famous brands such as Jaffa Cakes and McVitie’s digestives. In the past, British governments have taken a hands-off approach to allowing foreign corporate giants to snap up important UK businesses, including water and energy companies. The result is that American, German and French business giants now own a huge proportion of Britain’s infrastructure. However, giving the green light to foreign investment has created controversy. For example, the decision to allow Kraft of the US to buy Cadbury only then to lay off thousands of workers drew condemnation. Similarly, the idea that four of the ‘big six’ energy firms are foreign owned has angered consumers. Npower and E.on are both German, EDF is French and Scottish Power is Spanish-owned. The Spanish also own Heathrow, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Stansted airports through Ferrovial’s ownership of BAA.","Investment comes after Chancellor made Far East plea for investment in UK infrastructure .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:21 PM on 20th January 2012 . Britain's beleaguered retail sector saw slight respite last month as sales grew 0.6 per cent, but experts warned shoppers are set to 'close their wallets and hunker down' after their pre-Christmas splurge. Retail sales volumes grew 0.6% month-on-month in December, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, compared to a revised 0.5% decline the previous month. This was slightly below the 0.7% growth forecast by the City. The figure boosted hopes that the total economy would avoid contraction in the last months of 2011 but economists expect retailers to struggle in the new year as cash-strapped consumers rein in spending. Bargain hunting: Retailers slashed prices in the run-up to the festive season in a bit to lure cash-strapped customers . The slight increase in sales was not sufficient, however, to save high street names like Peacocks and Past Times, who have both fallen into administration recently despite posting positive Christmas sales. The increase in sales volumes was driven by clothing chains and department stores and came as store-price inflation dropped to its lowest rate for 16 months, the ONS said. There was evidence that spending on big-ticket items was still being held back as sales at household goods stores fell by 2.4% month-on-month, the biggest drop since April 2010. Economists have warned the sector is set to struggle this year, despite the growth in sales last month, as shoppers continue to cut back on non-essential spending and the economy teeters on the edge of recession. A graph from the Office of National Statistics shows that while the volume of sales has only increased slightly compared with last Christmas, the value of sales has increased more due to the increased price of goods . Data from the Office of National Statistics shows that non-food stores fared the best over December, while automative fuel sales and non-store retailing remained roughly the same . ‘The risk remains that pressurised and worried consumers will put away their purses and wallets, and hunker down for an extended period after a late flurry of spending in the run-up to Christmas and then taking advantage of the best of the bargains in the clearance sales,’ said Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight. The ONS said consumers spent £42.1billion in the retail sector last month, compared to £29billion in November and £39billion in 2010. Clothing and footwear stores posted a 1.8 per cent month-on-month volumes growth while department stores such as John Lewis recorded 1.2 per cent monthly growth. Data shows the value (in £ millions) spent in different retail sectors over the past two years in Britain . Too little, too late: Peacocks stores saw like-for-like sales go up 17 per cent over Christmas but it wasn't enough to save the chain . Looking for a buyer: Past Times went into administration . Sales at household goods store dropped by 2.4 per cent month-on-month, while food store sales saw weaker growth, with volumes rising month on month by 0.4 per cent and 1.2 per cent year on year. Profit margins across the entire retail industry have been hit by big discounts, putting further pressure on companies struggling to stay afloat. A host of household names have run into severe financial trouble recently, including fashion retailer Peacocks, lingerie firm La Senza and outdoor specialist Blacks Leisure.","Seasonal increase didn't stop Blacks, Peacocks, Barratts and Past Times from nearing collapse .

Police in Los Angeles distributed DVDs today featuring surveillance video of a man wanted for questioning in connection with a rash of suspicious car fires in the city. The person of interest is a white male between 20 and 30 years old with a receding hairline and a shoulder-length ponytail, according to Officer Sara Faden. The man was seen on video Saturday after emerging on foot from inside an underground parking structure on Hollywood Boulevard that was the scene of a car fire. Scroll down for video . Surveillance: Police say the person of interest (right) is a white male between 20 and 30 years old with a receding hairline and a shoulder-length ponytail . At large: Police point to video surveillance which shows a man on Saturday emerging on foot from inside an underground parking structure on Hollywood Boulevard that was the scene of a car fire . Detectives estimated the man, who was wearing a bulky jacket, is between 5'6"" and 6'1"" tall. Faden said investigators are asking for the public's help in identifying the man on the video. Detectives spent early Sunday . analysing security video camera footage and following up on other leads . after a half dozen more vehicles were set on fire on New Year's Eve. The arson attacks have left a trail . of smouldering debris across the city since Thursday after 39 fires were . set. Most were set in parked cars and in several cases, flames spread . to carports and apartments. Authorities haven't said how the car . fires started and were unsure if the blazes were the work of one arsonist or copycats. Police Commander Andrew Smith said his force was 'working on hundreds of clues, interviewing dozens of witnesses, picking up countless pieces of evidence'. No one has been injured in the attacks so far but extra patrols were out in force on New Year's Eve. One . of Saturday's attacks occurred at the Hollywood and Highland . entertainment complex, a popular tourist destination. Firefighters . responded after reports of a small car fire in a parking structure that . was out by the time they arrived. Fire . crews said this recent spate has been unusual because of the frequency . and location of the fires. Crews have been responding to other . emergencies despite the focus on solving the arsons, fire spokesman Erik . Scott said. Response: The fires started shortly after midnight and occurred over a four-hour span before dawn . Feeling the heat: A firefighter battles flames in Hollywood, California during another night of blazes. Authorities are now on the hunt for the person or people responsible, offering a $35,000 reward for information . Police urged residents to check their cars for any signs of tampering and take precautions such as locking their cars, keeping the garage lights on at night and reporting suspicious activity. 'We are not going to rest,' Los Angeles Fire Department assistant chief Pat Butler said at a joint police-fire news conference. 'We are going to work tirelessly.' Four car fires broke out in the Los Angeles area on New Year's Eve, . leaving authorities to probe for any links to a series of arson blazes . that burned dozens of cars in previous days. In a sobering counterpoint to the typical revelry of the night, fire . trucks were stationed in neighborhoods, police patrolled the city, . switchboards took hotline calls and thousands in rewards were offered. Fire fighters quickly put out a car fire at about 6pm in Hollywood that 'fits the profile of concern' authorities have been following for the arsons. Under control: Firefighters battle an apartment fire that started in the carport and spread into nearby units late on New Year's Eve in Glendale, California . Burned out: Erica Squivel cleans her apartment in the aftermath of an overnight fire started by a suspected serial arsonist. There have been around 30 fires across Hollywood over a two-day period . Destruction: A BMW car damaged in an arson is seen on N Kings Road on Sunday . Senseless act: The car's hood is completely destroyed from the blaze . Melted: A Mercedes-Benz car damaged in an arson is seen on N Kings Road on Sunday . A crew of ten put out the fire in minutes. The flames did not spread beyond the car and no one was injured. Officials were unsure how the fire started. Shortly before 9 pm, firefighters made quick work of two car fires in a carport in West Hollywood. Fire dispatch supervisor Robert Diaz said the fires were put out before they could spread. The fire closely resembled more than a . dozen set before dawn on Saturday, mostly in North Hollywood, and nearly . two dozen fires set in and around Hollywood a day earlier. Though some of the fires spread and damaged homes and apartments, none have brought injuries. 'We're pulling out all the stops,' fire department spokesman Brian Humphrey said. 'We're hoping that the . person or people responsible will be brought to swift and complete . justice.' At least 16 more cars were set alight over a three-hour period early Saturday. Authorities have offered at least $35,000 for information leading to the capture of the arsonists. Escape: Residents flee their apartments. One man, pictured, is escorted from his home with a cage of birds . Destroyed: Authorities inspect the damage at a garage. They believe the arsonist could have travelled by foot or bike as the fires broke out in a limited two-mile area . San Fernando fire captain George Villegas told ABC News some people have been questioned in connection to the blazes. 'We've . detained a number of people, none that we can say are legitimately . connected to this investigation at this point,' Villegas said. Detectives . are looking for a male driving a white and tan mid-1990s Lexus ES300 . that was seen at one or more of the fires, ABC News reported. Fallen star: A blaze ravaged the former home of Doors frontman Jim Morrison . West Hollywood Mayor John Duran . heatedly spoke directly to the person or persons suspected of starting . the fires, reports the LA Times. 'What . were you thinking?' he said. 'This is the most dense part of Los . Angeles. If you’re trying to say something, this is not the way to say . it.' Authorities are now scouring . surveillance footage across the area hit by Friday's fires in a bid to . capture the arsonist who forced residents from their homes. There . have been no civilian injuries but one city fireman was treated . and released from a hospital after a fall while battling a blaze on Friday. One of the blazes happened at the former home of late Doors lead singer Jim Morrison, who died in Paris in 1971 aged just 27. He . used to live in the house with girlfriend Pamela Courson in the 1960s . and it provided the inspiration for the Doors song ‘Love Street’. The home was listed for nearly $1.2 million earlier this year, according to real estate website Zillow.com. Witness Sandy Gendel said he heard explosions . from what he later determined were likely car tires. He saw flames 30 . feet high coming from the deck of the house and a gutted . Mazda Miata. 'It was just like a towering inferno,' Gendel said. Other Hollywood residents recounted their fear as the fires spread.

Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich is today facing questions that he may have ignored child labour laws by allowing his daughter to work as a church janitor when she was 13. During a presidential debate in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, on Monday, the former House speaker revealed that in the 1980s his daughter Jackie Gingrich Cushman worked in the part-time, minimum wage job. He was defending remarks he had made in December, when he said poor children in low-income households should be given the opportunity to be janitors at their own schools. Under fire: Newt Gingrich, pictured on the campaign trail in Greenville, South Carolina, yesterday, is facing questions that he may have ignored child labour laws by allowing his daughter to work as a church janitor when she was 13 . 'Actually proud': Jackie Gingrich carried out janitorial work at the First Baptist Church in Carrollton, Georgia, as a teenager in the 1980s . But federal child labour laws in effect today and during the 1980s specify that children are not allowed to hold such cleaning jobs, and that there are no exceptions made for places of worship. Reid Maki, of The Child Labor Coalition, told MSNBC: 'I definitely see it as a child labour violation. When you put a kid in a situation that's designed for adults you're asking for trouble.' The law only permits 13-year-olds to . deliver newspapers; babysit; work in a business solely owned or operated . by their parents; and work as an actor or performer in film, TV, . theatre or radio. Newt Gingrich's second wife claims she could end his presidential campaign with an explosive television interview, it emerged today. Marianne Gingrich, who was married to the GOP candidate from 1981 to 2000, has recorded an interview with ABC News. No details of what Marianne actually . told ABC have yet been made public, but the apparent debate within the . network as to when the interview should be aired suggests that her views . will be controversial. But the network is debating when to show the interview amid fears it could be seen as biased if it contributes to wrecking Mr Gingrich's election prospects. Newt and Marianne Gingrich were married from 1981 to 2000, after he divorced his first wife Jackie and before his marriage to Callista, a fixture on the campaign trail. Mr Gingrich is a staunch opponent of the legislation, which he has described as 'stupid'. During Monday's debate, he offered other examples where children as young as 11 have earned their own money. He said: 'They'd be getting money, which is a good thing if you're poor. Only the elites despise earning money.' 'I’m going to continue to find ways to help poor people learn how to get a job, learn how to get a better job and learn someday to own the job,' he added. In December, the former Georgia lawmaker had told a crowd in Des Moines, Iowa, that children in poor neighbourhoods have 'no habits of working and nobody around them who works'. Throughout his campaign, Mr Gingrich . has reiterated the point that successful people have started out working . early in life, shovelling snow, babysitting and delivering newspapers. He has questioned child labour laws and spoken of the need for people to help break themselves out of a cycle of poverty. But Professor Hugh Hindman, of . Appalachian State University and the author of Child Labor: An American . History, told MSNBC: 'Substitution of child labour for adult labour is . never an economic bargain. 'Not . only are adults with full-time jobs earning living wages displaced by . kids with part-time jobs earning minimum wages, but the competition . between children and adults will also depress the wages of those adults . who hold on to their jobs.' Sticking to his guns: Mr Gingrich is a staunch opponent of the current child labour laws, describing the legislation as 'stupid' Candidate: Mr Gingrich waves to supporters as he arrives for a town hall meeting with his wife Callista at Mutt's BBQ in Easley, South Carolina, yesterday . He added: 'Poor kids do need this kind of opportunity, but I'm not sure janitorial service is the ticket.' Mr Gingrich said his daughter did janitorial work at the First Baptist Church in Carrollton, Georgia, when she was a teenager and that the example could be turned into a model for the entire country. Her father also took a swipe at New York City unions saying that 30 schoolchildren could be hired to replace one janitor because the unions had negotiated such high pay for their workers. Recalling her time as a janitor, his daughter Jackie today said: 'I was actually proud of my clean bathrooms. I learned work has value.'","Jackie Gingrich Cushman worked in the minimum wage, part-time job in Georgia as a teenager in the 1980s ."
"By . Rob Waugh . Last updated at 5:13 PM on 19th December 2011 . It doesn't take a food expert to say that Western and Asian foods taste different. But it does take an expert to explain why. The idea of 'food pairing' isn't new - chemically analysing foods to see which flavour compounds they share has led restaurants to pair unlikely foods such as white chocolate and caviar. But new research - analysing 381 ingredients, 1021 flavour compounds and 56,498 recipes - has found that east Asian food takes an entirely different approach. It actually avoids foods that match. Pork chops with apple wedges and raisins: Thirteen ingredients - including pork - appear in 74.4 per cent of western cooking . Beef and vegetable stir fry: While east Asian cuisine does have 'defining' flavours such as garlic and soy sauce, its approach to pairing foods is different . 'Flavour pairing' has led to some of the most exciting cooking of the past few years. But it seems that 'pairing' foods isn't a hard and fast rule - and Western and Asian foods 'pair' flavours in completely different ways. 'Western cuisines tend to use 'pairs' that share many flavours,' say the researchers in a paper published in Nature. 'But east Asian cuisines tend to avoid ingredients that share them. This investigation opens new avenues towards understanding culinary practices.' The thickness of the 'cords' connecting the flavours here shows how many flavours they share - Western cuisine is more likely to pair foods that share lots of flavours, whereas east Asian cuisine avoids obvious 'pairs' This crucial difference in approach explains why food from different sides of the globe tastes so radically different. Researchers including Sebastian Ahnert from the University of Cambridge analysed 381 ingredients used around the world, and 1021 flavour compounds found in those ingredients - networking them to show how many 'flavours' each ingredient shared. They then compared the information with 56,498 recipes from Epicurious.com and Allrecipes.com, plus a Korean recipe site menupan.com to see which of five cultures - north American, western European, southern European, Latin and East Asian - paired flavour compounds that 'matched' each other most frequently. Two recipes analysed: Distinctly 'western' pairings - such as tomato and parmesan cheese - tend to 'pair' foods that have a lot of matching flavour compounds. Eastern matches - such as garlic and sesame oil, don't share as many flavour compounds . The results were surprising. North American and western European recipes tend to pair flavours that 'match'. Both southern European and east Asian recipes tend to avoid recipes where the ingredients share flavours.The contrast with east Asian recipes was particularly marked, the researchers found. The more flavours two ingredients share, the less likely they are to be used together in east Asian cuisine - whereas 13 key ingredients, including butter, milk and egg, appear in 74.4 per cent of dishes in north America. There are flavours that 'define' a cuisine - for instance basil in south European food, or soy sauce in east Asian - but the classic pairings of each cuisine, such as parmesan cheese and tomato (which share lots of flavours), and garlic and sesame oil (which share very few) show that 'food pairing' is a distinctly western idea. The 'flavour pairs' that define western and east Asian food take a totally different approach - while Western food is built on similar pairs such as butter and milk, Asian food seeks 'clashing' pairings such as sesame oil and garlic . The idea that the difference in approach is so different is all new. It also turns the whole idea of 'food pairing' cuisine on its head. If east Asian food tastes good by avoiding food pairs - rather than simply identifying, then pairing them - then perhaps this research paves the way for new avenues of experimental cooking.","Researchers analysed 381 ingredients, 1021 'tastes' and 56,498 recipes .

A former PGA golf champion was busted, along with 40 others, including teachers, college students, and a retired beekeeper, in a week-long child sex sting. ‘Operation Red Cheeks’ began January 8 and involved several different crime-fighting organisations across the Orlando, Florida area posing as children in chat rooms. Pro golfer Steve Thomas, 55, was charged with traveling to seduce an underage girl and using a computer to entice a legal guardian or parent to commit sex acts on an underage girl, according to officials. The sting: Professional golfer Steve Thomas (pictured) has appeared in 44 PGA tours. Police found three condoms, chocolate pudding, and a bottle of honey in his SUV . The PGA Tour Web site says the Meridian, Mississippi native has finished in the top 10 of a tournament only once, and his winnings stand at just over $25,000. He has appeared in 44 PGA Tour events. During his sting, he believed he was chatting with a woman about having sex with her 13-year-old daughter. Police found three condoms, chocolate pudding, and a bottle of honey in his SUV, the arrest affidavit states. The Osceola County Sheriff’s detectives also arrested 29-year-old Bryan Woodward, who was the head swim coach at Gator Swim Club in Gainsville. The law won: 40 people - including teachers, a swim coach, and an IT consultant were arrested in the week-long sting in Osecola County, Florida . According to an affidavit, he told a detective posing as a young girl that: ‘younger girls turn me on’ and brought treats with him to meet the ‘child.’ The club’s owner, Kathleen Troy, told the Gainsville Sun that Woodward was no longer working at the club, which is not affiliated with the University of Florida. ‘If anything had come up, we would not have hired him,’ Ms Troy told the paper. The Orlando Sentinel reports that nine students, ranging in age 18 to 30 were also arrested. The youngest is still in high school. Police said the success in the sting was due to many local and state agencies working together. Busted: Bryan Woodward, 29 (left) was the head swim coach at Gator Swim Club. Samuel Straitiff (right) worked as an IT consultant . Not so sweet: Dell Rio Highsmith, 70, (left) is a retired beekeeper and Ryan Stickle (right) works as a consultant . Sheriff Bob Hansell wrote in a statement: ‘These predators stalk the cyber community looking for children to victimise. ‘This operation resulted in 40 arrests which means at a minimum, 40 children did not fall prey to a sexual deviant.’ Alexander Roy, a 32-year-old eighth grade teacher at Manatee Academy in Port St. Lucie, was placed on administrative leave while the school district conducts the necessary investigation. Police said that when retired beekeeper Dell Rio Highsmith, 70, was arrested he had with him a heart-shaped box of chocolates, wine, and Viagra pills. Major sting: Winston Stephens (left) is a student at Full Sail University while Milton Richardson (right) works as an engineer . Building up: Ryu Nolin (left) works as a personal trainer and Alexander Roy, 32 (right) was an eighth grade teacher at a school in Port St. Lucie . The paper says that the 40 men were accused of everything from travelling to seduce a child to commit sex acts, lewd and lascivious battery of a child, and using a computer to solicit. Sheriff Hansell said: ‘This operation should also be a warning to all parents to monitor and be involved with their child’s computer activities.’ All the men arrested now face felony charges.","PGA golfer Steve Thomas, 55, among those held .

But that hasn't stopped the TV advertisement of the first Obama / Biden re-election campaign from featuring a remarkably youthful-looking president with luxuriant brown hair. Like many world leaders, Mr Obama has aged during the three years he has been in office, a process that in his case has been most visible through his greying hair. Scroll down for video . Looking good: The first TV advertisement of the Obama / Biden re-election campaign features a remarkably youthful-looking president with luxuriant brown hair . As he really is: A grey-haired Mr Obama meets students during a day of service to honour Martin Luther King at the Browne Education Campus school in Washington, DC on Monday . President Obama and Republican front-runner Mitt Romney are neck-and-neck in the race for the White House, a poll showed today. A survey conducted by CBS News and the New York Times found that 45 per cent of voters would support Mr Obama if the election was held now. Mr Romney would also receive 45 per cent of the vote. But independent voters, who helped propel Mr Obama to victory in the 2008 election, could be an obstacle in his bid for a second term in the White House. A majority of independent voters have soured on Mr Obama's presidency, disapprove of his handling of the economy and do not have a clear idea of what he hopes to accomplish if re-elected, the Times reported. Only 31 per cent of independent voters have a favourable opinion of the president and two-thirds say he has not made real progress in fixing the economy, the Times reported. In 2008, Obama won support from 52 per cent of independent voters, compared with 44 per cent who supported Republican presidential nominee John McCain. The president launched his first television ad of his re-election campaign, a 30-second spot, yesterday. It defends his energy record against . criticism from a Republican-leaning outside group in a sign that the . presidential race is entering a new phase even though Republicans have . yet to pick a challenger. The commercial responds to a . $6million ad campaign by a group backed by the billionaire Koch brothers . accusing Mr Obama of conducting pay-for-play politics in the bankruptcy . of California energy company Solyndra, which imploded despite a . $528million federal loan. The Obama ad opens by citing . 'secretive billionaires attacking President Obama with ads fact-checkers . say are not tethered to the facts'.

The president's advisers are moving . to directly rebut attacks from Republican presidential candidates who . have assailed Mr Obama in early voting states such as Iowa, New .

The ad comes in the aftermath of his . decision to reject a job-producing oil pipeline running from Canada . through Texas, citing environmental and public safety concerns. It will be coupled with stepped-up travel surrounding next Tuesday's State Of The Union address. The president heads to Florida later . today and then visits five states over three days next week to discuss . the policies he will pursue leading up to his re-election campaign. The president's advisers had . anticipated a lengthy fight in the Republican primaries, but the . decision to begin airing ads reflects the need to respond to criticism . from outside Republican groups and prepare for a campaign against Mitt . Romney. The former Massachusetts governor has . won contests in Iowa and New Hampshire and shown strength in upcoming . contests in South Carolina and Florida, giving him an inside track to . the nomination. By the end of last year, Mr Obama had . raised more than $220million for his campaign and the Democratic .

"By . James Chapman . Last updated at 2:00 AM on 21st January 2012 . Nick Clegg last night joined the chorus of demands to strip disgraced banker Sir Fred Goodwin of his knighthood. The Deputy Prime Minister’s intervention means all three main party leaders have now backed a review of the honour for the ex-Royal Bank of  Scotland chief. Whitehall’s Forfeiture Committee is to consider whether to ask the Queen to revoke Sir Fred’s knighthood, which was bestowed on him in 2004 for ‘services to banking’. Under fire: Calls for Sir Fred Goodwin, seen here with his wife Lady Joyce, to lose his knighthood have intensified with Clegg backing Miliband's opinion . The Deputy Prime Minister said: ‘Honours should be deserved and awarded to unique people who have made Britain a better place. ‘I sympathise with those who think it a travesty for a man who did so . much damage to the British economy and made so much money in the process . to retain his knighthood. ‘I understand the outrage and there is an independent process that deals . with revoking honours – they must be left to make their own decision on . this.’ Mr Cameron has said the Forfeiture Committee should take into . account a damning report into the collapse of RBS by the Financial . Services Authority last month. Ed Miliband, left,  has backed calls for Sir Fred to have his knighthood removed while David Cameron, right, is sympathetic to the calls too and revealed a secret Whitehall body is to consider revoking the title . It said poor decisions by Sir Fred were a major factor in the crisis . that led to RBS being bailed out with £45billion of taxpayers’ money. Meanwhile, Tory MP Matthew Hancock has tabled a series of questions over . the granting of Sir Fred’s honour. Mr Hancock is demanding all correspondence between Treasury officials, . ministers and special advisers relating to the honours list of 2004. Gordon Brown, who was Chancellor that year, is said to have backed Sir . Fred’s award, but it emerged yesterday that the Scottish government then . led by Jack McConnell, now a Labour peer, pushed Sir Fred’s nomination. Mr Hancock has tabled a Commons motion arguing it was ‘perverse and unacceptable’ that Sir Fred should keep the knighthood. Conservative Party chairman Baroness Warsi and Labour’s shadow education . secretary Stephen Twigg also backed calls for the knighthood to be . forfeited. The Treasury, as the department which recommended the RBS chief, pictured in 2009, for the award in 2004, is expected to set out reasons for its removal to the Forfeiture Committee . But Lord McConnell insisted Sir Fred was not the only person to blame . for the collapse of RBS. He said: ‘I think the reasons for what happened . at the banks are more complex than just one person. ‘Fred Goodwin made mistakes, but so did a lot of other people at RBS, . including people on the board who also have honours. They appointed him . and agreed the strategy and have never been held to account. ‘I think the Government, both the Labour and Tory government before it, were making mistakes about regulation. ‘I sympathise with the public concern on this issue but I think if you . are going to have a system that is relatively independent and fair in . allocating these awards then you need to have a system that is . independent and fair in looking at removing them.’ By Alex Brummer . Arrogance: Sir Fred Goodwin who was removed from his job in 2008 . The only surprise about the clamour to strip Sir Fred Goodwin of his knighthood is that it has taken so long. It was all the way back in October 2008, in the tumultuous days following the crash of Lehman Brothers, that he was unceremoniously removed from his job as chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland. RBS had all but collapsed and was nationalised at a cost to taxpayers of £48billion. But, even in those final hours, he negotiated himself an astonishing pensions package originally worth £16million, or £693,000 a year for the rest of his life. Heading for the lifeboat first, as the ship was listing, was an act of selfishness and hubris seldom matched in British public life. The disaster at RBS immeasurably damaged this nation and all who live in it. It has tainted banking and the financial system, one of the great pillars of Britain’s modern prosperity, and massacred the reputation of all bankers. Far more seriously, it has destroyed life savings, and helped condemn the nation to slow growth and surging unemployment. And at the heart of this catastrophe was Goodwin, a man who had a swagger and an arrogance unmatched in a financial world not short of egos. His mad drive to turn RBS into the world’s largest bank drove him to trample over all those in his way as he indulged in a frenzy of reckless lending. The consequences of his appalling misjudgments are being felt today, and will be for years to come.The bank abandoned all pretence of traditional Scottish prudence and lent to anyone who knocked on the door. Among those able to borrow money was the ambitious entrepreneur Richard Kirk, who needed money to buy the high street shopping chain Peacock’s. When RBS pulled the plug on the company this week, 10,000 jobs were placed at risk, adding to the tens of thousands already lost at RBS. Goodwin came to believe he was better than anyone else at what he did. There is no greater testimony to his overweening vanity than RBS’s monstrous ‘World Headquarters’, built on a greenfield site at Gogarburn on the outskirts of Edinburgh. This folly was designed to please the chief executive, and hang the shareholders and customers. Secure in his palatial headquarters, he organised his surroundings, including the kitchens, allegedly so that scallops, a favourite dish, could arrive at his desk while at their moist best. There was a private aircraft, RBS1, a fleet of BMW limousines stamped through with the RBS logo and a suite at the Savoy for his London visits. Most disgracefully of all, Goodwin felt so above the rules that governed the lives of ordinary RBS employees and staff in other large organisations that he felt able to conduct an extramarital affair with a senior female colleague. He then hid behind a court injunction until he was found out. Goodwin’s willingness to use the law to hide his egregious behaviour has become notorious. When a Sunday Times diarist reported on the supposed scallops kitchen he sued for libel. More recently, he hired lawyers to sanitise the investigation by the Financial Services Authority into the firm’s collapse. As a result, Goodwin receives only a handful of mentions in the report. What does come through loud and clear is his hectoring and bullying, which made colleagues too scared to challenge him. At the height of his reign, in the summer of 2008, after he had wasted £49billion of shareholders’ money buying the badly-run Dutch bank ABN Amro, I visited him for lunch. When I questioned the wisdom of buying a bank in the middle of a credit meltdown, he forcefully defended his actions. It was ignorant and dangerous bravado. The deal must rank as one of the greatest derelictions of duty by a chief executive in modern times.His knighthood – arranged by Gordon Brown in 2004 – makes a laughing stock of all those deserving of the honour. It also casts a terrible pall over the honours system and cocks a snook at all those suffering because of Goodwin’s mistakes. His is a case so exceptional the Queen, on the recommendation of government, should not hesitate to remove this blot on the business world. To do so would show the world what moral capitalism actually means, and perhaps even give the banking system the fresh start it craves. By Becky Barrow and Tim Shipman . Defiant: Stephen Hester who the Prime Minister said should not receive 'a penny in bonus' David Cameron vowed to block a £1million bonus for the boss of a failed bank rescued by the taxpayer yesterday. The Prime Minister’s war on excessive executive pay comes as critics said Royal Bank of Scotland boss Stephen Hester should not receive ‘a penny in bonus’. Mr Hester, 51, is said to be in line to enjoy a £1.5million windfall despite the fact that the bank’s share price has halved over the last year. Asked if he would act to stop the bosses of state-owned banks receiving £1million bonuses, Mr Cameron replied: ‘The short answer is yes.’ The Prime Minister announced that the Government would cap cash bonuses in the two state-owned banks – RBS and Lloyds TSB – at £2,000 for all employees and would use its clout as major shareholder to limit the amount in shares paid to senior executives. No 10 sources said the Prime Minister is ‘determined to act’ and would assure that there was no repeat of the ‘absurd’ bonus paid to Mr Hester last year, which topped £2million. Yesterday experts expressed fury that Mr Hester could be weeks away from a bonus while the rest of the country suffers an income squeeze. Sources say Mr Hester is adamant he deserves his bonus for his role at the helm of the disgraced bank, which was kept afloat with £45billion of taxpayers’ money. But Sir Philip Hampton, chairman of RBS, insisted rumours that a £1.5million bonus has been agreed are ‘inaccurate and premature.’ He said: ‘Neither the remuneration committee nor the board has discussed the position on the bonus for our chief executive for 2011 at this stage. Any suggestion to the contrary is therefore untrue.’ The timing is particularly awkward because Business Secretary Vince Cable will on Tuesday reveal his plans for curbing executive pay.","Ed Miliband is also calling for wider reform of the honours system .

"By . Sara Nathan . Last updated at 12:22 PM on 20th January 2012 . David Beckham revealed his wife and children persuaded him to end his football career in America. The former England captain today said he had signed a new two-year contract with LA Galaxy because his family - wife Victoria and four children - were happiest living in America. Beckham, 36, who turned down a massively lucrative deal from Paris St Germain, admitted: ‘When you’re married and you have children, your priorities change.’ Still living the American dream: David Beckham discussed his decision to resign with LA Galaxy during a live broadcast from the Google headquarters today . Meet and greet: The sportsman answered questions from the crowd about his life and career . The multi-millionaire sportsman said . things had changed since his days as a rising star at Manchester United . when he and Victoria were not married and they both had more freedom to . focus on their careers. ‘It was a lot easier for us to make decisions based on our careers,’ he said. ‘We have three amazing boys and a little girl we have to look after so now our priorities are all about them.’ Happy to have him: LA Galaxy Head Coach Bruce Arena presents Beckham with his new jersey during the press conference announcing his new contract . The couple’s sons, Brooklyn, 12, . Romeo, ten, and Cruz, six, are settled at school in Los Angeles, while . their daughter Harper was born there last July. Beckham added: ‘My family are . happiest here at the moment. We love living in LA, we love living in . America. We’ve adapted to the culture and everything the country has.’ And the star joked that he was . relieved to sign his new contract with LA Galaxy because he needed to . fund Harper’s bulging wardrobe. Thrilled: Beckham takes to the microphone to address questions at the press conference . ‘Her wardrobe is ridiculous already,’ he grinned. ‘I’m glad I got a two-year contract.’ Beckham was speaking in an interview . streamed live online, which took place at Google’s headquarters in . Mountain View, California. The former Manchester United star had . the audience in stitches as he was asked him whether he listened to . Spice Girls music to get him motivated for a game. Family focused: David, pictured here with wife Victoria, said his priorities have changed now that he's a father of four . He quipped: ‘The Spice Girls? Of course. ‘Wannabe’ always gets me going before I go on!’ But he quickly added: ‘Spice Girls is not on the playlist. It’s on my iPod but not on the playlist. ‘I’m a huge Jay-Z fan. I’m a huge Stone Roses fan, who are getting back together in June - just plugging then. Me and my girl: Baby Harper will spend her first few years living in LA . “Certain managers at certain clubs . don’t like music in the changing room before a game. Most players end up . listening with their headsets.” Beckham squirmed as he took questions . live from the Google office in London, via a videolink, and was asked . whether England or the USA were more likely to win a World Cup. He said: ‘That’s a terrible question to ask me when I’m sat here.’ Stylish as ever: Victoria was seen looking chic in a checked pencil skirt as she left the The Arts Club in Mayfair earlier this week . ‘I’m going to have to say England. I’m really sorry. I’ve got a lot of respect for US players and the US . team but I believe at some point England are going to win a World Cup. ‘We’ve got a lot of talented players in our country, we’re very passionate and it’s where the game began.’ Beckham also revealed how he plans to travel to Africa when he retires from football, to coach underprivileged children. ‘I need to be passionate about something I’m going to go into,’ he said. ‘People always ask me if I’ll go into . coaching when I retire. I love coaching but I’d love to go into the . field to places like Sierra Leone, to Africa, to see the kids and coach . them.’ Family takes priority: It is believed Beckham turned down a move to Paris St Germain because he didn't want to move his family to France . Speaking about a previous trip to . Sierra Leone, he said: ‘These kids are walking about with literally no . clothes on. But you arrive, put a soccer ball in front of them and they . play like my kids play. That’s what soccer can do. ‘It can change people’s lives. It can take them away from the lives they’ve got every day. That’s the power of soccer.” But he revealed that he planned to play football for as long as he could. ‘Every time I step on the field I’m like a little kid. Once that changes, that’ s when I’ll feel I’ll have to stop,” he said. ‘Until that changes I’ll keep playing for as long as possible - as long as teams are offering me new contracts.’ In action: Beckham's five-year deal with LA Galaxy expired last month, but he will now be with the team for a further two years . He added: ‘It’s different now with kids - there’s fame and fortune. I’d still be playing this game even if I wasn’t paid for it. ‘Not that I don’t want to be paid for it, but I’d still be playing this sport,’ he laughed. Beckham gushed about his wife, . Victoria, and their four children - Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz and Harper, . describing his family as his ‘proudest possession.’ The father-of-four said he loves . taking his sons to play football and practise taekwondo, and still can’t . believe his luck in having a baby daughter. He said: ‘With boys you can throw them up and they just drop and get up and run around. ‘I’m changing her diaper and thinking . I can’t believe I’ve got a girl. Everything about her is feminine - the . way she moves, eats, smiles. ‘Naturally the first word is going to be ‘Momma’. She’s close to it already, she’s saying a few things.’ ‘The best thing about it is she’s got three older brothers and a dad,” he added protectively.",He calls daughter Harper's wardrobe 'ridiculous'

They were the brave duo who endured shellfire on the Western Front in a tale which rivals Steven Spielberg's latest wartime blockbuster. But while Spielberg's 'War Horse' was adapted from a children's book for the big screen, Sergeant George Thompson and his faithful charge braved hellish conditions for real in the First World War. Decorated hero Sgt Thompson even defiantly disobeyed orders to shoot his horse when it became sick, instead building a secret stable and nursing it back to health. Bond: Sergeant George Thompson after he had been ordered to have his horse shot. This picture shows him at the head of a team of horses at a military camp, in Yorkshire in 1920 . Hero: An example of the Military Medal for Bravery that was awarded to Thompson in 1919 for saving lives during heavy shelling . In diary extracts revealed for the first time, Sgt Thompson writes of his close bond to the horse which he cared for throughout the Great War. Sgt Thompson penned the moving diary in 1928 for his then two-year-old daughter, although his relationship with the horse did not begin well. Sgt Thompson got the horse from a local contractor and could remember the old driver asking him to take good care of him and saying, 'he is quiet and a good worker and will go anywhere'. But it was not an easy start to the friendship - the horse he would eventually nurse back to health used to kick and bite him every time he went for a drink. Sgt Thompson, from Sunderland, wrote: 'The horse I was in charge of was a rank bad one. Nearly every time I took him for a drink I used to get into trouble. He used to kick and bite and bolt away. I was soon fed up with him.' He went to France early in 1915, his duties included transporting ammunition and provisions to the frontline. The horses had to wear a harness all the time and suffered from skin diseases, but often nothing could be done for them. In his diary, Sgt Thompson writes: 'I . remember when we were at Fricourt there was a skin disease came out . among our horses and an officer came up one morning and ordered about 15 . horses to go down the line (to be shot) and one of those was the horse I . brought from England. Brave: Sergeant George Thompson pictured standing left with fellow members of the 7th Battalion The Durham Light Infantry Pioneers in a field at Marne, France, taken two days before the retreat in July, 1918 . Touching: Copy of page 39 of Thompson's diary describing how he saved his horse after he was ordered to have it shot during the First World War, which is on display at The Durham County Record Office . 'So instead of sending him away, we sent another in his place and we built a stable for him away from all the other horses and looked after him ourselves.' A month later the horse was back on duty. Sgt Thompson recalled the horrors of riding over dead bodies, enduring heavy shell fire, always wishing the 'rotten war was over'. He and his horse had happy times too, such as racing on the beach in Ault, France. Sgt Thompson was twice mentioned in despatches and received the Military Medal for saving the lives of his fellow soldiers under heavy fire. Masterpiece: Steven Spielberg's depiction of the cavalry charger Joey in the film War Horse . He went on to be a fermenting room foreman for Vaux Breweries and died in 1958. The story of Sgt Thompson and his faithful horse is being told at a new exhibition to coincide with the release of Steven Spielberg's wartime epic Warhorse. Archivist Liz Bregazzi, who is involved in the exhibition, said: 'The exhibition is based on the diary of Sergeant Thompson, who, together with hundreds of others, volunteered for the transport section of the 7th Battalion the Durham Light Infantry. 'The nice thing about it is the way it is written. He is an ordinary soldier and it is very much a personal account.' Ms Bregazzi added: 'There were so many horses out there. Amazingly, this man went through the entire war with the horse he started off with. We don’t know the name of the horse. He never says, which is strange.'","Sgt George Thompson defied orders to shoot his horse when it became sick .

A man whose dismembered head, hands, and feet were found in a Hollywood park regularly hiked the area, a friend said. Hervey Medellin, a 66-year-old . retired airline worker enjoyed trekking the rugged, hillside park, which . was near his Hollywood apartment. According to his friend Vilma Aguilar, he met a new friend while hiking Griffith Park last year. Police said they were working round . the clock to hunt down the retiree's killer. Commander Andrew Smith said . Friday: 'They did serve a search warrant last night. They are following . clues, and the case is progressing.' Medellin's head was found by two dog walkers earlier this week in the hills by the famed Hollywood sign. Detectives questioned at least one . man Thursday after serving a search warrant at Medellin’s apartment . complex, towing a silver Honda from the building that evening, the Los . Angeles Times reports. Two women hike in Griffith Park on Wednesday near the Hollywood sign after a plastic bag containing a human head was discovered the previous day by two women walking their dogs on a nearby trail off Canyon Drive in Los Angeles . Having worked for Mexicana Airlines for 20 years, Medellin was retired and collected expensive art, CBS reported. Neighbours said they had grown concerned when they didn't see him out walking his dog in the park in recent weeks. Andrew Hill, who lives on the second . storey of Medellin’s apartment complex, told the Times that around three . weeks ago, he heard a loud altercation. Furniture was being moved, Mr Hill . said, and he heard screaming and shouting in the middle of the night. Detectives later asked him what time he saw the trash being taken out . Thursday, he said. The grisly discovery was made in the land close to Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's Hollywood Hills mansion, and because the area . is often used for filming, the couple who found the head first thought . it was a film prop. The area was a location for the original 'Batcave' in the 1960s Batman series starring Adam West. Lauren Kornberg and her friend were walking nine dogs and . saw two of the animals playing with an object in a bag. 'Our assumption was that there was always people filming up there, and it was a prop,' said Mrs Kornberg. 'We walked down the ravine and got closer and realized it was a freshly severed human head.' The Batmobile leaving the Batcave. The area where the head was found is where filming took place for the 1960s Batman series starring Adam West . Neighbourhood: The head and hands were found just blocks from Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's home (pictured) Investigators did not believe it had been there long calling the head 'fresh'. Then late on Wednesday night, two hand and two feet were discovered near the city's iconic Hollywood sign. There are reports today that detectives are questioning a person of interest in connection with the discovery. Investigators raided a Los Angeles apartment building last night near to where the human remains were found, KFI-AM reported. The events have unfolded like a gory movie script, and police are now . trying to identity the man. More than 100 police . officers, some on horseback, searched a Hollywood wilderness park . along a winding hiking trail. The first hand was . found as dozens of officers and homicide investigators combed the brush, . and a coroner's cadaver dog came upon it about 50 yards from where the . head was discovered on Tuesday afternoon, the Los Angeles Times . reported.The second hand and both . feet were found nearby later Wednesday afternoon. No details were . immediately available on the condition of the body parts. The man might have been killed elsewhere in recent days and his body dumped in the park, Cmdr Smith said.

"Celebrity Big Brother star insists she doesn't judge Ryan Giggs' wife Stacey for staying with the footballer . Thought Imogen Thomas was treated unfairly in the aftermath of her affair with Ryan . Is hopeful she and Rhodri may be able to rebuild their relationship romantically again in the future . By . Emily Sheridan . Last updated at 3:45 PM on 19th January 2012 . When Natasha Giggs was photographed kissing and cuddling her estranged husband Rhodri this week, many assumed the couple were back together. But the Celebrity Big Brother star, 29, insists they aren't a couple, but are building a friendship for the sake of the children. Speaking on This Morning today, Natasha spoke of her regrets over her eight-year affair with brother-in-law Ryan, 38, and her hopes that Rhodri, 34, will be able to trust her again. Setting the record straight: Natasha Giggs spoke about her eight year affair with brother-in-law Ryan on This Morning . Referring to photos taken of them in a Bolton park this week, she said: 'The pictures are a bit misleading. We've been speaking for a long time. We've spent a lot of time together over the past few months. 'We both want to move on it from it. We both want to move on a friendship. 'Nobody is saying we're going to get back together. We're working on things for our children. 'In an ideal world, we will be together, we will be a family again. Whether or not we'll get over it, time will tell.' Grilling: This Morning co-host Phillip Schofield gave Natasha a succession of tough questions . Natasha admitted the pair had been trying to work through their problems since they split in June in the aftermath of her confession. She insisted: 'Rhodri can trust me. That's what we're working on now. Its a huge thing to get over. If we do get back together is because we want to be together and we can 100 per cent trust each other... 'I love Rhodri. People have affairs for various different reasons. I do love Rhodri and I've always loved Rhodri.' But when quizzed by This Morning host Ruth Langsford why she fled to Spain the day she sold her story instead of tell her husband face-to-face, Natasha admitted she was scared. She explained: 'Rhodri and I had a really fiery relationship. I honestly thought he was going to kill me. 'It's one of my biggest regrets. I wish I had told him myself.' Stern words: This Morning agony aunt Denise Robertson told Natasha she didn't believe she had fully realised the consequences of her actions . Natasha had already had a brief romance with Ryan - while he was dating now-wife Stacey - when she first met Rhodri in 2003. Despite her sleeping with the Premiership footballer on and off during an eight year period, she pointed out that there was a three year period they didn't see each other. But she ended up meeting Ryan during a night out in 2010 - just two months before she wed Rhodri in Las Vegas. She said: 'Nothing had happened with us for a good three years beforehand. We bumped into each other on a night out and it just happened. Back on track? Natasha and Rhodri Giggs enjoy a romantic walk in a park near their Bolton home earlier this week . 'I don't expect sympathy. Nobody will ever think of me for anything else except what I did. I've always held my hands up. It wasn't just me. I do feel like a lot of the stick that comes my way... 'I wasn't the only person involved.' When . asked what she thought of Ryan's wife Stacey - who she was involved in a . slanging match with in a Manchester street in November - Natasha . insisted she didn't judge her for forgiving the Manchester United star. She said: 'I can't really say anything to her apart from what happened. I can't judge her for staying with him. 'I had four conversations with her during our (Rhodri and my) eight year relationship. We didn't really socialise together.' Glossy locks: Natasha popped into Tatiana Hair Extensions in Kensington, London last night to get her hair done for her TV appereance . Despite a Twitter row with Imogen Thomas - another woman alleged to have had an affair with Ryan - Natasha insists she actually felt sorry for the Welsh model. Former Miss Wales Imogen was banned from . speaking about her six-month fling with Ryan after he got d a court . injunction to silence her. Sympathy: Natasha said she felt sorry for Imogen Thomas, who was wrongly labelled a blackmailer by Ryan . Last month, the High Court found Ryan had withdrawn his previous claim that suggested Imogen had tried to blackmail him. The judge accepted Imogen did not ask Ryan for £100,000 to buy her silence over their affair. Speaking today, Natasha said: 'I have absolutely no problem with her. It was unfair the way she was treated. To be publicly labelled a blackmailer.' She insisted the only reason she hit back at Imogen on Twitter was because the model had started writing things about her first: 'I've never mentioned her, I've never tweeted on her and I felt there was no reason for her to say anything about me.' Natasha vehemently denied This Morning agony aunt Denise Robertson's accusations that she didn't fully understand the fall-out of her affair. She insisted: 'I've lived through this the past six months. Its easy for people outside to say that. Unless you're living through it you don't know what's going on.' Natasha's Television appearance came after she denied tabloid claims she slept with a barber on holiday last summer. Although single at the time following . her split from Rhodri, the Celebrity Big Brother star has denied having . sex with Graham Griffiths. Denial: Natasha hit out at Griffiths' claims this morning on her Twitter page, insisting she didn't sleep with him . The 23-year-old barber, from Somerset, alleged he had slept with the brunette during a holiday in Ayia Napa last August. Griffiths . told The Sun: 'I only knew her for three nights and I slept with her . every one. She wore me out - she let me do everything with her and I . couldn't help myself. 'Natasha's a man-eater and I think the only chance of their marriage working is if Rhodri keeps her locked up.' She wrote on Twitter this morning: 'Pathetic! Last August as a single girl on holiday... With no sex involved. Sad little boy.' Gimme volume: Natasha gets her hair boosted by a stylist at Tatiana Hair Extensions . Clearly supporting his wife, Salford . City F.C. manager Rhodri - who has now called off plans to divorce her - . retweeted her comment on his Twitter page this morning.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 10:31 PM on 20th January 2012 . Movie bosses have sparked fury with the placement of an 'incredibly insensitive' advert for a new film about the September 11 attacks just yards from the site where almost 3,000 people lost their lives. The video ad for Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close shows the disintegrating Twin Towers ablaze on a subway hoarding beside Ground Zero. Firefighters and families who lost colleagues and loved ones in the 2001 terror attack have branded the marketing drive offensive and have complained that the ads are too close to home. The trailer (bottom right of picture) for Extremely Loud And Incredibly Close which shows the World Trade Centre towers burning is visible to commuters leaving Cortlandt Street metro station . They say the siting of the promotional material for the Warner Bros feature is unforgiveable and they are upset that there is no warning that the emotional footage is about to be shown on the video-style adverts. Passerbys can see the horror replayed over and over again from the sidewalk without any notice. One firefighter from Ladder 9 in New York's East Village, told the New York Post: 'We lost ten guys that day. I won’t go see it. I saw the ad last night. I just can’t. People who live and work around here would be offended by those ads. That happened right here.' Controversial campaign: Tom Hanks stars in the movie with child star Thomas Horn playing his son . Lest we forget: The 9/11 Memorial at Ground Zero, on the site of the former World Trade Centre twin towers. Families of victims are furious at the placement of video adverts using footage of the fall of the towers to sell the latest September 11 movie. The video adverts featuring the flaming Twin Towers can be seen along Church Street at Murray, Vesey and Courtland Streets. It also appears in front of the Millennium Hilton Hotel. Every single one of the locations is in the shadow of the new World Trade Centre construction. The ads have been run in 40 digital panels throughout Manhattan with 500 posters on the city subways and buses. Poster campaign: 40 digital panels, 40 billboards and 500 posters have been plastered across Manhattan for the movie's marketing campaign . Forty massive billboards have promoted the latest Tom Hanks blockbuster in the heart of the district most affected by the devastating assault. Movie makers stand accused of making money out of the atrocity which killed 2,606 people in the Twin Towers alone, a tally that includes 343 New York firefighters. Families of victims say they were not given warning that the sickening footage would be shown on a loop in public. They claim that such is the force of the horror of the attack New Yorkers still suffer from stress as a result of the events of the September 11 attack ten years ago. A spokesman for Warner Bros said today that the company would cancel the ads and apologised for any distress they may have caused. The film, based on the 2005 novel by Jonathan Safran Foer, stars Tom Hanks as a 9/11 victim. The story follows his sensitive nine-year-old son, Oskar Schell, on his journey to find the lock that fits a mysterious key left behind by his father. Hollywood A-lister Sandra Bullock and child star Thomas Horn also star in the latest movie about the disaster. The downing of the Twin Towers was part of four co-ordinated Al-Qaeda suicide attacks which resulted in the deaths of 2,996 immediate victims, including the 19 hijackers. Tragedy: This still from the movie Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close shows how moviemakers have included footage of the burning towers in the new Tom Hanks film . Starring role: Thomas Horn as Oskar Schell in Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close, the new 9/11 Warner Bros movie . The Islamist extremists hijacked four . airliners and intentionally crashed two of them into the World Trade . Centre. The towers collapsed within two hours of being struck. They also took control of American Airlines Flight 77 forcing it down over the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia. The . fourth jet, United Airlines Flight 93, crashed into a field near . Shanksville, Pennsylvania, as passengers forced it down before it could . reach the attackers' intended target in Washington DC. Apart . from 55 military casualties all the victims were civilian. The names of . some of the immediate victims of 9/11 were not added to official . figures until years later. Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close . is the boldest cinematic tackling of September 11 yet. Instead of . dealing with the hard facts of the fateful day that shook America, as . its predecessors have, it is the first work of fiction to take up the . tragedy, diving straight into grief and loss. But many have accused the movie of . being too much too soon. At the recent tenth anniversary of the terror attacks . and the official opening of the memorial site, it was clear to . see that emotions still run high, tears are still being shed and . memories are still raw. Director Stephen Daldry said: 'Some people might find the wound too big and that they can't go there — and they shouldn't go there. Some people will find it cathartic. I had to follow my own instincts on it.' Four other films have been made about the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre.","Video advert plays emotional scenes without warning .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:48 PM on 19th January 2012 . A Taliban suicide bomber detonated a car packed with explosives outside a U.S. and NATO base in Afghanistan today. Seven civilians, including two children, were killed in the second suicide bombing in as many days in the southern part of the country. Afghan authorities also reported that avalanches have killed at least 29 people in the country's mountainous northeast. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the afternoon attack at a crowded entrance to Kandahar Air Field, claiming they were targeting a NATO convoy. Blast: Seven civilians were killed in the Taliban attack outside the U.S. and NATO run Kandahar Air Field in southern Afghanistan . Two witnesses said they suspected the suicide car bomber was trying to hit U.S. forces because he detonated his explosives just as two pickup trucks, which they say are often used by American special forces, were leaving the base. The coalition said no NATO troops were killed. It did not disclose information about injured troops. Taliban spokesman Qari Yousef said that NATO forces opened fire after the bombing, and that they killed three of the seven civilians who died. The coalition denied this, saying there was no fighting after the blast. The coalition added: 'There was no follow-on attacks and no disruption to operations.' Earlier, officials reported that the suicide bomber was walking near the gate, but the Afghan Ministry of Interior later said the attacker was driving a Toyota Corolla. Zalmai Ayubi, the spokesman for the Kandahar provincial governor, said two children were among the seven civilians killed. On guard: Soldiers watch over the scene of the blast where seven people, including two children, were killed . He said eight other civilians, including two children and one woman, were injured in the explosion. Gates to the larger U.S. bases in Afghanistan are often crowded with trucks waiting to deliver goods and and services, and local Afghans going to or coming back from jobs on the compounds. Safiullah, a 40-year-old fuel tank driver from neighboring Zabul province, was waiting his turn to enter the base when the blast occurred. He said: 'There was dust and smoke everywhere. I got down on my knees. When the smoke lifted, I moved closer. I saw two children dead at the side of the road.' At the time of the explosion, two pickup trucks were leaving the base, he said. He said he remembered that because he and another man were conversing at the time about how U.S. special forces sometimes use that kind of truck. The explosion shattered the window of a taxi driven by Sabiullah Khan, was at the gate waiting for customers. He said: 'I put my head down in my car. For three or four minutes I was afraid. I was reciting the words of the Koran. Patrol: A U.S. soldier is pictured in Kandahar, south of Kabul, earlier this month as he conducts checks of the area . 'When the smoke cleared and I knew I was OK, I started looking outside. People were shouting for help. I saw one vehicle on fire. The Afghan army were running and taking out the wounded.' He said that when he got out of his taxi, he also saw the two pickup trucks. He added: 'Nobody was in them, but from the condition of the vehicle, I'm sure that if they were not killed, they were wounded.' Yesterday 13 people, including three Afghan policemen, were killed when a suicide attacker blew himself up in a bazaar in neighbouring Helmand Province. The Helmand governor's office said 22 others were wounded in the blast in Kajaki district. The coalition said some international troops were killed and wounded in the attack, but did not disclose details. NATO reported that one coalition trooper had been killed in an explosion in southern Afghanistan, but would not say whether the service member died in the Kajaki bombing or some other incident. High alert: U.S. soldiers keep watch at the site of a suicide attack in Kandahar on January 3 after a suicide bomber killed five . U.S. Gen. John Allen, the top commander of American and NATO forces in Afghanistan, condemned the Kajaki attack, saying it was evidence that the Taliban insurgents had 'declared outright war' on the Afghan people. He said that such violence 'will only further isolate the Taliban from the process of peace negotiation'. The U.S. has been working to broker talks between the Taliban and President Hamid Karzai's government to end the 10-year war. The insurgents recently said they would open a political office in the Gulf state of Qatar to pursue negotiations but would also continue fighting. In northern Afghanistan, 29 people have died in avalanches reported since Monday in Badakhshan province, according to the Afghan National Disaster Management Agency. At least 40 more people have been injured and rescuers were struggling to reach areas of Afghanistan's mountainous northeast that have been cut off by heavy snows. Roads outside the provincial capital of Faizabad were blocked by at least 6ft of snow, the agency said. Afghanistan's harsh winters and mountainous terrain in the north make avalanches a danger each year. In February 2010, an avalanche killed at least 171 people near the Salang Pass, a major route through the Hindu Kush mountains that connects the capital of Kabul to the north of the country.","Two children killed in today's attack outside Kandahar Air Field .

The night of mayhem occurred in Denver, Colorado, on August 27 when Robert Jeffrey Young, 43, and Mark Rubinson, 25, put Jeffrey Jarrett, 43 - who they believed had passed out - into the back of Rubinson's Lincoln Navigator. They then headed to a bar and restaurant where they used Mr Jarrett's credit card. At one point, Young and Rubinson allegedly withdrew $400 from an ATM at a strip club. Guilty: Mark Rubinson (left) and Robert Jeffrey Young (right) both pleaded guilty to 'abuse of a corpse' and Young to identity theft .

"Reveals he didn't think last year's Britain's Got Talent judging panel Michael McIntyre, David Hasselhoff and Amanda Holden 'did a good enough job' Admits he poached Alesha Dixon for BGT to hurt Strictly Come Dancing . Concedes he was too optimistic about X Factor USA and will be making 'changes' for this year's series . By . Emily Sheridan . Last updated at 12:19 PM on 20th January 2012 . Simon Cowell has broken his silence on the disastrous decisions he has made which have led to a slump in ratings for Britain’s Got Talent and The X Factor. The music mogul, who is now back in Britain following a month-long holiday, is hoping he can find out what went wrong last year and turn things around for his two biggest shows. After a successful 2010 for both series, Cowell admitted he got 'a bit too cocky' last year and admitted the slumping viewing figures had 'put my ego in check'. Humbled: Music mogul Simon Cowell admitted he got 'a bit too cocky' over the success of his TV shows X Factor and Britain's Got Talent . As the 52-year-old prepared to return to the Britain's Got Talent panel full-time for the first time in Manchester today, Cowell admitted he was prepared to work hard to get back on top. With the brutal honesty he is famous for, Cowell criticised last year's BGT panel Michael McIntyre, David Hasselhoff and Amanda Holden for not doing 'a good enough job'. He said: 'There . are always stars waiting to be discovered. Sometimes they need to be . pointed in the right direction and I don't think that happened enough . during the show last year.' 2011 saw Cowell quit the panels of both X Factor and Britain's Got Talent to focus on launching X Factor USA. Fleeting: Michael McIntyre and David Hasselhoff only appeared on the judging panel of Britain's Got Talent for one series, while Amanda Holden remains . Of course, X Factor USA didn't go too smoothly after he fired Cheryl Cole and the show failed to attract the huge ratings he predicated. When he left the UK shows, he felt confident they would continue to succeed after the 2010 finals of X Factor and Britain's Got Talent attracted 19.4million and 15million viewers respectively. However, the 2011 series of X Factor UK - with new judges Gary Barlow, Tulisa Contostavlos and Kelly Rowland joining Louis Walsh - found itself being regularly beaten in the ratings war by BBC rival Strictly Come Dancing. Despite in-fighting between the judges and controversy surrounding contestant Frankie Cocozza, the series averaged 14.13million viewers, with 15.5million tuning in to watch Little Mix crowned the winners. Dropping figures: The new X Factor panel (L-R) Louis Walsh, Kelly Rowland, Tulisa Contostavlos and Gary Barlow couldn't always compete with Strictly Come Dancing . However, the previous year, a record 19.4million watched Matt Cardle beat Rebecca Ferguson to the crown. Meanwhile, Britain's Got Talent peaked in 2009 when 19million saw Susan Boyle lost to Diversity, with 15million watching Spellbound triumph in 2010. He told The Sun: 'I got a bit too cocky. We got a big wake-up call. Cowell's favourite year: 19.4million people watched Matt Cardle win X Factor in 2010 . 'We went into 2011 thinking, ""It's all going to be easy"" and of course it wasn't. It was the year my ego was put in check. 'We all got a bit smug last year, I . certainly got a bit too cocky. I ended 2010 on a real high, it was the . Matt Cardle year - my favourite year - and the figures for X Factor were . huge.' As well as the fall in the UK shows, his new game show Red Or Black was surrounded in controversy when it was revealed the £1million winner Nathan Hageman had been jailed for assaulting his girlfriend. Earlier this month, it was revealed Cowell had poached Alesha Dixon from Strictly to be a judge on the new series of Britain's Got Talent, along with David Walliams. And after X Factor was frequently beaten by Strictly last year, Cowell was in the mood for revenge. He said: 'I did have this plan, thinking, ""You're . not going to be smiling so much next year if this comes off"". With us . and the BBC, I laugh about it, but there is unbelievable rivalry now... 'But the Alesha thing was kind of fun. My decision to poach her was 70-30 on the fact she was on Strictly and . the fact I liked her. Newbies: Cowell admitted he was optimistic about the launch of X Factor USA with judges (L-R) Antonio 'LA' Reid, Nicole Scherzinger and Paula Abdul . 'I knew the BBC was putting on The Voice. They've done this to have a pop at The X Factor and to have a go at the BGT ratings.' The Voice - a BBC version of the hit US show - will launch in March - the same time Britain's Got Talent hits screens. Meanwhile, Cowell is also preparing to make 'changes' to X Factor USA. Although the series attracted healthy ratings, they were still a long way off attracting the same audience as Cowell's former show American Idol. Whether Antonio 'LA' Reid, Paula Abdul or Nicole Scherzinger will be returning this year or if Steve Jones continues to present the show remains to be seen. Winners: An average of 15.5million viewers watched Little Mix win last month's X Factor .","Reveals he didn't think last year's Britain's Got Talent judging panel Michael McIntyre, David Hasselhoff and Amanda Holden 'did a good enough job'

"By . Nick Pisa . Last updated at 4:03 PM on 20th January 2012 . Dramatic footage of a Costa Concordia crew member telling passengers to 'Go back to your cabins' has emerged. The plea came despite the luxury liner being fatally holed and underlines the chaotic situation in the moments after the ship struck rocks. Holidaymakers wearing red life jackets can be seen milling on the deck of the Concordia in the mobile phone footage which was posted on Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera's website. Emergence of the footage came as a cook from the ship said Captain Francesco Schettino had ordered dinner at 10.30pm - nearly an hour after the liner struck rocks at 9.41pm. Scroll down to see the videos... Calling for calm: This crew member may have asked passengers not to panic, but it came after the ship had struck rocks . Chaos: A crew member tried to calm passengers down who stood in the ship's corridors wearing lifejackets . Disaster: An incredible aerial shot of the doomed Costa Concordia shows just how far it has listed onto its side . Questions have already been raised as to the slow response from captain Francesco Schettino in waiting more than an hour to abandon the stricken 290m Concordia. And the footage confirms passenger accounts of how they were told to return to their cabins sending some of the victims to certain death. The film also again underlines how Schettino and his crew were still insisting that the situation was all down to a 'electrical black out'. But by then he knew that the ship had suffered a 70m gash in its hull after hitting a reef off the coast of the Italian island of Giglio as he sailed past too close in a mad moment of showing off. Debris: A bench engraved with the name of the grounded Costa Concordia has washed up on the shore . Rescue effort: Firefighters approach the stricken cruise liner as stormy weather sees the search being called off over fears the ship could slip from its rocky resting place . Busy: Italian firefighters have scoured the doomed Costa Concordia as they try to find the 21 missing people . Service: Lorenzo Pasquotti, Giglio Island parish priest (centre) prays with Orbetello bishop Girolamo Borghetti during a Mass on the harbour next to the Costa Concordia . Further light has been shed on what happened to the youngest person still missing from the doomed Costa Concordia. Dyana Arlotti, five, and her father William have not been accounted for since the ship ran aground last Friday. But a children's entertainer has revealed the Rimini girl was part of a group of eight youngsters he took charge of after they were separated from their parents in the chaos. John Lazzarini, who was at the time dressed as Spiderman, shepherded them to a quiet corner, organised them into a chain and led them hand in hand to the deck. He told the Telegraph: 'We heard the signal to abandon ship. We went down to Deck 4, the pickup area, where I divided them up according to which muster station they belonged to and helped them find their parents.' But some of the children, including Dyana, whose mother (top right) was pictured on Giglio yesterday, became lost in the chaos. The female crew member is seen telling . passengers in Italian: 'The situation is under control. Go back to your . cabins. We ask you that you all return to your cabins. 'Once the electrical problem is sorted out everything will be back to normal shortly. Everything is under control. We are resolving the problem.' However, just 30 minutes after the video was shot cowardly captain Schettino eventually gave the order to abandon ship. But by then it was too late as the ship had begun to list too far over for the lifeboats to be launched safely and passengers had to make their way down the superstructure of the hull using rope ladders. This morning the search was called . off after movement was detected by lasers pointed onto the ship and it . was deemed too dangerous for the dive teams to carry on the hunt. There . are still 21 people still missing, who are believed to be lying in . muster stations on decks submerged below the water. A total of 11 people . have been confirmed dead. The . main concern for teams working on the ship is the weather, as although . they have been lucky in the week following the tragedy the forecast is . for strong winds. Relentless: Scuba divers have searched large swathes of the stricken ship over the last five days as hopes fade of finding any more survivors . Looking: Divers have had to postpone their efforts several times amid fears they could become trapped . Shipwreck: The main concern for teams working on the ship is the weather, as although they have been lucky in the week following the tragedy the forecast is for strong winds . The ceremony of the 'salute' (inchino) - where captains sail dangerously close to shore - appears to be widespread among captains of Italian cruiseships. TradeWinds publication reported 'it has become frequent in Italy to be dazzled by the sight of one of Costa's giant ships blaring its horns a few hundred metres from shore'. Italian environment minister Corrado Clini spoke out about the manoeuvre, and made it clear it will no longer be tolerated. The fear . is that it could whip up waves around the Concordia and shift it further . - even possibly dislodging it from the rock shelf it is resting on. Fire brigade spokesman Luca Cari said: 'The search was suspended at around midnight because movement was detected. 'It was thought best to pull the dive teams out and we are now deciding the best course of action.' The . revelation that Schettino had ordered dinner at 10.30pm - less than an . hour after the liner struck rocks at 9.41pm - was made by ship's cook . Rogelio Barista. Claims: Moldovan ballerina Domnica Cemortan (left) was seen 'cavorting' with captain Francesco Schettino on the bridge . Defended: Captain Francesco Schettino (left) has been defended by Domnica Cemortan (right) Illuminated: The Costa Concordia lights up the Tuscan coast last night as rescue efforts were suspended once again . He told Filipino TV station GMA: 'We wondered what was going on. 'At that time, we really felt something was wrong. 'The . stuff in the kitchen was falling off shelves and we realised how grave . the situation was. I have had 12 years of experience as a cook on a . cruise ship. 'I have even witnessed fires, so I wasn't that scared. But I did wonder, though, what the captain was doing. Why was he still there?' Investigators . are looking into the role played by the owner of the Costa Concordia as . the order to abandon ship was delayed by 68 minutes. They . are looking in particular at the requirement that, once the order is . given, each passenger is entitled to  €10,000 euros in compulsory . compensation. It would mean a  €30million bill for the 3,000 tourists. Costa Cruises declined to comment on the compensation allegations. But . it has labelled itself as an 'aggrieved party' in what could be one of . the biggest maritime claims in history. It has also suspended Captain . Francesco Schettino. Prosecutor Francesco Verusio has also said that the only suspects were Captain Schettino and the Second Officer Ciro Ambrosio. Suspension of the search comes after it was revealed Moldovan ballerina Domnica Cemortan, 25, was seen cavorting with Schettino on the bridge of the ship in the minutes before his cruise liner foundered on rocks. Italian authorities believe Schettino - dubbed Captain Coward - may have been distracted from his command by trying to impress the dancer who they now consider to be a 'key witness'. Miss Cemortan, who has a two-year-old daughter, had worked as a translator for the Concordia but was on holiday on the ship at the time of Friday night’s disaster. She has now defended the captain, who she told Moldovan TV had 'saved over 3,000 lives'. She also said she was summoned to the bridge to help translate for the evacuation of Russian passengers. Prosecutor Francesco Verusio declined to comment on Italian media reports that Ms Cemortan was being sought as a witness. Schettino is under house arrest and faces . possible charges of manslaughter, abandoning ship and causing a . shipwreck. He admitted he made an unauthorised detour from the programmed route . that caused the vessel to slam into a reef and capsize off the Tuscan . island of Giglio. Hard at work: The ship is at risk of completely sinking in the next few hours . Yesterday an audiotape of the doomed vessel's first communications with maritime authorities showed the ship's officers continued to report only an electrical problem for more than 30 minutes after hitting the reef. Seven of the 11 dead were also identified yesterday by authorities - four French passengers, one Spanish and one Italian passenger and one Peruvian crew member. Italian passenger Giovanni Masia, who would have been 86 next week, was buried in Sardinia. Italian authorities have identified 32 people who have either died or are missing: two Americans, 12 Germans, seven Italians, six French, two Peruvians and one person each from Hungary, India and Spain.","Crew member's plea came as luxury liner was fatally holed .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 6:32 PM on 21st January 2012 . A man cleared of murdering two soldiers In Northern Ireland has claimed his DNA was planted in the getaway car. Colin Duffy, 44, said the charges against him were ‘spurious’ but refused to condemn dissident republicans. It is the third time he has beaten terror charges in 20 years. He was acquitted of shooting Sappers Patrick Azimkar, 21, and Mark Quinsey, 23, as they collected pizza at the gates of Massereene barracks in Antrim. Cleared: Colin Duffy, who was cleared of a separate murder charge 20 years ago, was acquitted of the same charges as Shivers . Duffy, 44, first hit the headlines 20 years ago after he was cleared of an IRA murder. Co-accused Brian Shivers was yesterday convicted of murdering the two sappers outside Massereene army barracks in March 2009. The trial judge said there was a 'strong . suspicion' Duffy, 44, was involved in the Real IRA plot to kill the . servicemen in March 2009. Even though his DNA was found on a seat buckle and the tip of a latex glove found in the getaway car there was not enough evidence to convict him of taking part in the 'murderous attack'. But today, he told a news conference: ‘I am firmly of the view that my DNA arose there because it was planted. I was never in that car. ‘I state quite categorically here that I had no involvement in what happened at Massereene, no involvement whatsoever, and that has been vindicated in court because there was no credible evidence to suggest otherwise.’ Asked about republican violence, he said: 'This is a legacy issue here in relation to what has taken place in Ireland in a historic context and far be it for me to be the person who can end all of this armed struggle and all the rest of it, these are issues for these particular groups out there.' He added: 'I am not into condemning these groups or anything like that because I don't believe there is any value in that. I do not support them either but I am not into the politics of condemnation.' Duffy said hostility from families of the dead Sappers came after they had been fed information by the 'forces of the state'. 'They are feeding them tittle tattle and rumour and innuendo.' The soldiers' families broke down in court as Duffy, who has long-standing connections with terror groups in Ulster, walked free. In 1996 the Court of Appeal quashed the Lurgan republican's conviction and life sentence for murdering a former UDR soldier John Lyness. He had spent three years in custody, almost the same length of time he has been on remand over the Massereene murders. A year later he had charges of killing two policemen, John Graham and David Johnston, dropped due to insufficient evidence before any trial. Killed: Sappers Patrick Azimkar, left, and Mark Quinsey, were shot head as they went to collect a pizza outside the Northern Ireland barracks .

Sapper Patrick Azimkar's mother Geraldine Azimkar at his former barracks in Northern Ireland . Despite the . Rosemary Nelson Inquiry hearing a police claim Duffy was a driving force in . the north Armagh IRA, he denied ever having been a member and claimed . that he had been persecuted by the police. Before his release, Duffy had been on remand in . Maghaberry prison where he has been on a no-wash dirty protest against . his continued incarceration. Terminally-ill Brian Shivers was . found guilty of murdering Sapper Azimkar, from London, and Sapper . Quinsey, from Birmingham, just hours before they were due to deploy to . Afghanistan with 38 Engineer Regiment. Guilty: Brian Shivers, 46, pictured at an earlier court hearing, was convicted of the double killing of two British soldiers . Shivers, . a drinker and gambler who suffers from cystic fibrosis, was also found . guilty of six counts of attempted murder and one of possession of . firearms and ammunition with intent to endanger life by Judge Anthony . Hart after a six-week trial without a jury. He was sentenced to life in . prison. The Real IRA, a Republican splinter . group opposed to the  peace process, claimed responsibility for the . ambush, which left four others injured. Mr Justice Hart said Shivers, 46, had invented an alibi for his . movements on the night of the murders by claiming he had a Chinese meal . and attended Catholic mass. But his DNA was found on struck matchsticks recovered from the back seat . of the partially burned-out Vauxhall Cavalier used in the attack. It . had been dumped and torched eight miles from the scene in a bid to cover . the gunmen’s tracks. Doctors have given Shivers, from Magharafelt in County Londonderry, . between three and four years to live so he is likely to die behind bars. Duffy, from Lurgan, County Armagh, refused to give evidence. He was . acquitted of the same catalogue of charges. Mr Justice Hart, sitting at Antrim Crown Court, said the prosecution had failed to link the defendant to the murder plot. He said: ‘There must be strong suspicion Duffy did know what was going . to happen. However suspicion, no matter how strong, is not sufficient to . establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt. ‘I consider there is insufficient evidence to satisfy me beyond . reasonable doubt that whatever Duffy may have done when he wore the . latex glove, or touched the seatbelt buckle, meant that he was preparing . the car in some way for this murderous attack.’ Sapper Azimkar’s mother Geraldine, 58, said: ‘This was a terrible crime. Losing Patrick has devastated our family and cast a dark shadow over . our lives.’ Sapper Quinsey’s sister Jaime said the murders were a ‘vicious, cowardly . act’ and said: ‘We have come a little closer to justice.’ Another prominent republican is to be tried in connection with the Massereene murders, while police suspect at least one more person was involved. Old Bailey bomber Marian Price has been charged with providing property for the purposes of terrorism and earlier this week a judge ruled there was a prima facie case against her as he returned her for trial. The 57-year-old former IRA hunger striker, who along with her sister Dolours was jailed in 1973 for her role in a republican bombing campaign in London, allegedly provided a mobile phone for the Massereene murder gang. And police also believe one member of that gang was a son of self-confessed republican killer Dominic McGlinchey. The claim that one of his sons drove the getaway car used in the gun attack was made by a defence barrister during the six-week trial of Colin Duffy and Brian Shivers. Barry MacDonald QC, representing Duffy, told the court: 'Police hold reliable information to indicate that a son of Dominic McGlinchey Snr was the driver of the vehicle which was subsequently recovered by police and was used in the fatal shooting of two soldiers in Antrim on March 7 2009.' Dominic McGlinchey Jnr, 34, and Declan McGlinchey, 35, were both arrested and questioned by police investigating the murders but neither was charged. McGlinchey Jnr has denied the criminal allegations made against him during the trial and has indicated his intention to make formal complaints to the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Police Ombudsman over the references about him made in open court. His father, Dominic Snr, was a notorious member of republican splinter group the Irish National Liberation Army.","Veteran Irish republican Colin Duffy cleared of murder for second time in 20 years .

The Artfinder app lets users share what exhibitions they've been to: Like all Timeline apps, it posts updates about what you're doing to friends, and also offers them a chance to install the app themselves . Facebook has launched 60 new 'timeline' apps - applications that post updates in real time about what people are doing, and also add updates to people's Timeline. Facebook claims the update - live from today - will allow users to 'personalise' their page more, adding updates that reflect their interests, and sharing them with your friends list, or with lists you authorise for each app. It has potential to be a radical change to how people view the site, with food fans able to share recipes and restaurant reviews with other users, and book fans able to automatically 'share' what ebooks they've read. As ever with Facebook, there are privacy concerns. Many sites recommend vetting apps carefully to see what they will post, and creating lists of friends to 'share' certain updates with, rather than bombarding your whole friends list. Tech site CNET warns, 'Once you install the app and authorize it to post stories on your . profile and News Feed, it'll never ask for your permission again.' The update - live today - will be a huge overhaul for most people's experience of Facebook. The site's algortihm with try to predict posts you are interested in based on your apps and posts, and will prioritise both your news feed, and your own Timeline based on this. The profile of a foodie will feel distinctly different to the profile of a bookworm, for instance. Up until now, Timeline apps tended to be largely about music. After the site's recent overhaul, applications such as Spotify started to post updates saying 'This person is listening to...' which appear in Facebook's news ticker. But the idea - and the number of updates - is set to go much bigger. The new apps will add updates about cooking, eating, films, concerts, books and travelling. The apps will add updates to New Ticker (the fast-scrolling feed up the right hand side of Facebook) and to your Timeline. Some may also post directly into your News Feed. Facebook is soliciting developers to make apps for every area of interest . The Rotten Tomatoes app lets people share what films they've watched, and what films they want to watch . The Foodspotting app is one of several applications that let users share recipes, what they've eaten and what they want to try . With Facebook's new 'frictionless sharing', it should mean that people's news tickers are even more densely populated than ever - and that people, once again, start 'sharing' without realising what they're doing, as users have seen with Facebook games, apps and indeed Spotify. The apps include timeline apps from Foodspotting, Foodily, Ticketmaster, Pinterest, Rotten Tomatoes, Pose, Kobo, Gogobot and TripAdvisor, and others. 'You can now enhance your timeline with apps that help you tell your story, whether you love to cook, eat, travel, run, or review movies,' says Facebook. 'Once you've added an app, you can begin updating your timeline with your activities as they happen. For example, if you love design, shopping or fashion, you can add the Pinterest or Pose apps to make your favorite items part of your timeline.' The Kobo app syncs with the popular ebook reader and shares what people have read and 'liked' via their Timeline . 'If you love to cook, you can add the Foodily app to your timeline and share your latest dishes. If your friends have added the Foodily app, you can discover new recipes with each other, as you'll see their updates in the ticker and their timeline, and possibly News Feed.' Facebook says that more Timeline apps, covering more interests will launch soon. 'Our vision for Timeline and our vision for the application platform is whatever you love and whatever story you want to tell, you can add that to your Timeline,' said Carl Sjogreen, Facebook's product management director.Facebook Timeline with Apps and Ticker'Our message to developers is 'start your engines',' said Sjogreen.","New apps 'personalise' your page with interests such as cooking .

"By . Jill Reilly . Last updated at 4:59 PM on 20th January 2012 . Today France threatened to pull out early from the NATO-led war in Afghanistan after a rogue Afghan soldier opened fire on French soldiers, killing four and wounding about 15 others. French President Nicolas Sarkozy said all French operations on the ground were being suspended and his defence minister was dispatched to clarify things on the ground in Afghanistan. 'If the security conditions are not clearly established then the . question of an early return of French forces from Afghanistan will . arise,' said Sarkozy. Statement: Today France threatened to pull out early from the NATO-led war in Afghanistan after a rogue Afghan soldier opened fire on French soldiers, killing four and wounding about 15 others . 'It’s unacceptable that our soldiers are killed by our allies,' Sarkozy said. If the security conditions are not clearly established then the . question of an early return of French forces from Afghanistan will . arise,' said Sarkozy. France has almost 4,000 troops in Afghanistan as part of the 130,000-strong NATO-led force there. French troops mainly patrol Kapisa, an often restive province in . mountains near Kabul. They are due to leave by around the end of . 2013. Cease operations: Mr Sarkozy said it was 'unacceptable' that Afghan troops would attack French soldiers . French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told a news conference about 15 . other soldiers were wounded, eight of them seriously. The Taliban said that they could not confirm whether or not the . killer was a Taliban member but signalled that such attacks were part of . its strategy. NATO has been rapidly expanding the size of the Afghan security . forces so that they will be able to take over all responsibility for . security by the time Western combat forces leave in 2014. Afghan President Hamid Karzai said in a statement: 'In regard to the . killing of four French soldiers in Kapisa, I would like to express my . deep sadness and condolences to the families of the victims as well as . to the French people.' In an email statement to media, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid . said: 'There are a number of Afghan soldiers who have an Afghan, Islamic . dignity in their hearts and who have carried out a number of attacks . against foreign troops.' The Taliban 'has skillfully placed the Taliban inside enemy ranks who . have carried out attacks, however it is not clear whether the shooter . (in Kapisa) belonged to the Islamic Emirate', he said, using another . name that the Taliban call themselves. Jimmie Cummings, spokesman for the NATO-led International Security . Assistance Force in Kabul, said: 'There is no indication that these . incidents are linked or part of any larger coordinated effort.' More than 2,500 foreign troops have died in Afghanistan since the NATO-led war began in 2001. The latest killings take the French toll to 82. Halted: France has almost 4,000 troops in Afghanistan as part of the 130,000-strong NATO-led force there (file photo) The shooting was the latest in a string of attacks by 'rogue' Afghan soldiers and police on their foreign partners, or by insurgents who had infiltrated security forces. Dozens of foreign soldiers have been killed in recent years by what NATO dubs the 'insider threat', complicating coalition efforts to train Afghanistan’s army and police force. Two French Foreign Legion soldiers and one American were killed in separate episodes of so-called “green-on-blue” shootings last month, which refer to the colours of the Afghan army and the symbol of NATO. The coalition no longer releases the number of its troops killed by Afghan soldiers. French Defence Minister Gerard Longuet said he would report back to Sarkozy by next Tuesday after his trip to Afghanistan. Late Thurday six U.S. marines were killed in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan, American officials said today. The crash in Helmand Province is the worst since last August when 30 soldiers, including elite U.S. Navy Seals, were killed. The cause of the accident is unknown - although there was no enemy activity area at the time of the crash. The Nato helicopter involved was believed to be a Marine CH-53 Sea Stallion. Tragedy: Six Nato soldiers were killed in the crash. Sources said it was a Marine CH-53 Sea Stallion involved like this one pictured . The crash happened hours after seven civilians were killed in a suicide bombing outside Kandahar Air Field - a base for U.S. and Nato operations. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack and said they were targeting a Nato convoy. Two witnesses said they suspected the suicide car bomber was trying to hit U.S. forces because he detonated his explosives just as two pick-up trucks, which they say are often used by American special forces, were leaving the base. Taliban spokesman Qari Yousef said Nato forces opened fire after the bombing and that they killed three of the seven civilians who died. The coalition denied this, saying there was no fighting after the blast. Earlier, officials reported that the suicide bomber was walking near the gate, but the Afghan Ministry of Interior later said the attacker was driving a Toyota Corolla. Zalmai Ayubi, the spokesman for the Kandahar provincial governor, said two children were among the seven civilians killed. He said eight other civilians, including two children and one woman, were injured in the explosion.

"Brian Dowling was videotaped 'placing his genitals on an LSU fan's face' By . Louise Boyle and Jill Reilly . Last updated at 2:29 PM on 20th January 2012 . An Alabama man has been arrested in connection with a video appearing to show a college football fan inflicting a horrifying sexual assault on a rival supporter after he passed out in a fast food restaurant following the game. Brian Downing, 32, of Smiths Station, Alabama, was booked on charges of sexual battery and obscenity. He was videotaped on January 9 'placing his genitals on an LSU fan's face. The LSU fan appears to be heavily inebriated and practically unconscious,' a police statement said. Arrested: Brian Downing, was booked on charges of sexual battery and obscenit after being videotaped 'placing his genitals on an LSU fan's face' Captured: Downing is a second cousin of Russell County, Ala., Sheriff Heath Taylor, who said that he learned from other family members Thursday morning that Downing had been identified in the video and called his father to bring him down to the station . Sinister attack: An Alabama University football fan climbed onto an unconscious student from Louisiana State and rubbed his genitals in his face following a game in New Orleans . V for victory: The attacker raises his arms in celebration after he shoved his genitals into another man's face - he then returns to assault him again at the packed fast food restaurant in New Orleans . The footage was uploaded to the Alabama University sports channel . BamaSportsForum on YouTube - and promptly deleted after it swept the . Internet. Police said sex crimes detectives met . Downing at his attorney's office in New Orleans, where officers . arrested him. Downing looked at the ground as officers escorted him in . handcuffs into the jail. Neither he nor the officers answered questions. Police said LSU and Alabama University campus police helped them collect . information and evidence needed to get a warrant for Downing's arrest. Downing is a second cousin of Russell County, Ala., Sheriff Heath . Taylor who turned him in. Taylor said that when he heard the allegation from his family that he had no choice but to . arrest Downing or send him to New Orleans. 'I wasn't going to let . anybody say that because he's my family I wasn't doing anything about . it. Mr Taylor said, he called Downing's dad . and told him to bring him to the sheriff's office in Phenix City, Ala. It wasn't a hard decision, he said. 'You've just got to do the right thing.' Downing's actions were videotaped about 11:45 p.m. Jan. 9, at a restaurant on Bourbon Street, police said. 'Person of interest': New Orleans police have release the photograph of this man who they would like to speak to following the incident in New Orleans on January 9 . Getting into the spirit: Alabama student Ellen Cassin, dressed in the team's shirt, poses for a picture over the unconscious LSU student (left) and having more fun (right) A video taken on a camera phone . showed a group of students from Alabama University surround the . Louisiana State University student who is slumped over a table passed . out, at a Krystal restaurant in New Orleans on January 9. The . footage was uploaded to the Alabama University sports channel . BamaSportsForum on YouTube - and promptly deleted after it swept the . Internet. It shows a man climbing on top of the rival fan and rubbing . his genitals repeatedly in his face. The alleged sexual assault happened . following a game between the two colleges during the Bowl Championship . Series where Alabama beat LSU 21-0. The clip, which lasts for five . minutes shows a group dressed in crimson Alabama shirts placing cartons . on the young man's head while whooping and cheering, snapping pictures . on their camera phones. One voice, off camera, says: 'This guy's life is over.' The hazing continues with rival fans . sticking straws up the man's nose and leaning over him while football . chants echo around the fast food joint, where hundreds of fans have . gathered. Another man adds: 'Seriously, I don't see him moving' before adding, 'someone has to pour water on him.' The man shifts slightly in the seat with his head slumped on the table but remains unconscious. It is then that a rival fan, dressed . in a baseball cap, red hoodie and khaki shorts pulls his genitals out of . his pants and climbs over the other man, grinding into face. Scott Myers, a spokesman for Birmingham, Ala.-based Hibbett Sports Inc., . confirmed Thursday that the company fired Downing on Wednesday because . of his part in the video. He said the company had been aware of the tape but did not identify the . person on it until Wednesday. He refused to say what the man did for . Hibbett or how the company became aware of his alleged involvement. Hibbett Sports lists about 800 stores in 26 states. 'We were made aware of this situation late yesterday afternoon. We . conducted our own investigation, and after the investigation was . concluded, we made the determination to terminate his employment,' Myers . said. College graduate: Patrick Setterstrom (left) at first tries to reveal himself before he is stopped by his more sensible girlfriend Ellen Cassin. He recently left college (right) Two students in the clip have been identified by Deadspin.com - Patrick Setterstrom and his blonde girlfriend Ellen . Cassin. He appears to attempt to expose himself at the start of the . video before his girlfriend restrains him. Since the clip appeared both . have deleted their Facebook profiles. The . recent college graduate is the son of Alabama's WKRG TV station's . sports director Randy Patrick Setterstrom. The station admitted that it . was their director's 22-year-old son. Remi Braden, director of public . affairs at New Orleans Police Department, told MailOnline: 'We were . alerted to the video last Sunday and immediately started a preliminary . investigation. 'No one in the restaurant where the . incident occurred contacted police but the investigation is ongoing. Because this is a possible sexual battery case, we are not in a position . to release more information at this time.' The victim may not necessarily have to come forward as charges can be brought in the name of the state. However Ric Simmons, a criminal law professor at the Ohio State University Moritz College of Law, points out that this is a far from a straightforward case. He told MailOnline: 'Technically a prosecutor does not need a victim to prosecute a crime, as long as there is other evidence sufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. 'But although it is possible to obtain a conviction in a case like this without a victim, it will be difficult to do so. A jury may not take the case very seriously if there is no victim willing to testify. 'In this case, as reprehensible as the conduct may appear to some, others may see it as merely a crude college prank which does not rise to the level of criminal behavior. 'That perspective will only be reinforced if the victim does not care enough about the case to come forward.  Given this challenge, a prosecutor’s office may be reluctant to commit their scarce resources to prosecuting such a case.' Professor Simmons teaches criminal law at Ohio State. Prior to becoming a law professor, he was an assistant district attorney for New York County.

The paedophile even filmed the rape, and then forced the woman to give evidence, during which she had to watch the footage of the assault. At the Court of Appeal yesterday, the judge demanded to know how he got into the country. She asked: ‘He comes into this country with a conviction for raping a child. Do we let in just anyone, even if they have such a serious conviction?’ In . June last year Polish burglar Kuba Dlugosz was convicted of . manslaughter after he bound and gagged a helpless pensioner before . ransacking her home and leaving her to die of hypothermia. Eveline Kelmenson, 83, suffered a . slow and painful death after she was stripped of gold jewellery and . abandoned in her nightclothes. She was found dead in her North London . home on New Year's Dad 2009. Dlugosz slipped through police hands weeks before the killing. He was arrested twice for burglary . but officers did not discover he was wanted on a European arrest warrant . because he gave them a false name. Fingerprint checks that would have . revealed he was a dangerous career criminal who had escaped from a . Polish prison the previous year were not carried out. Six years after an Albanian court . sentenced him in his absence to 20 years jail, British police tracked . down Imer Hoxha to an address in East London. Using the fake Kosovan name of Imer Beq Hasani, he had claimed asylum in the UK as a victim of the Balkans War. The false ID allowed him to move . freely in the UK, until police raided his house when they suspected his . son had committed a burglary. Akulic’s barrister, Catherine Purnell, told her he was allowed into Britain because Lithuania is in the EU. The judge replied: ‘I appreciate that, but do we have to take in anybody, even if they have a conviction for raping a child?’ The case prompted questions about the extent of checks on EU nationals who come to Britain. Akulic, 44, had been jailed for nine years in July 2001 after raping a seven-year-old whom he lured into his house with lemonade. After the assault, he threatened to kill her if she reported it. A decade earlier, he had been jailed for seven years for a serious assault. He beat his girlfriend, breaking her nose, and then locked her in a room for two weeks. He also served two years for burglary. After his release from a Lithuanian jail in 2009, he came to the UK and settled in Sheerness, Kent. The following year he attacked a woman, leaving her ‘horribly disfigured and in pain’. He then forced her to perform a sex act on him, and filmed the assault. At his trial at Maidstone Crown Court he pleaded not guilty to common assault, rape and intimidation, which forced the woman to give evidence against him. Commenting on Akulic’s defence tactics, Judge Martin Joy said: ‘She must have felt utterly humiliated and she was certainly visibly distressed. The photographs of the victim are unforgettable. ‘Anybody who has to assess the seriousness of these offences could not do so without seeing what that woman looked like as you raped her – black eyes, bruises to her face, shoulders, arms, legs, all around. It is horrific and it demonstrates how depraved you are.’ Akulic was jailed for life with a minimum sentence of eight and a half years, but appealed. Yesterday the Court of Appeal handed him an indeterminate sentence for public protection and reduced his minimum jail term to seven years. He will be let out only when the Parole Board is satisfied he is no longer a threat. Akulic had appealed his sentence at the London Criminal Appeals Court after he was handed a life jail term last year . The Home Office said Akulic did not appear on a ‘watch list’ of criminals and terror suspects. As a result border staff were not aware of his convictions when he arrived. The UK Border Agency said: ‘We check all passengers entering the UK against watch lists but we rely on overseas police to inform us of conviction information which did not happen in this case.’ It is the latest in a string of cases where foreign criminals have committed serious offences in the UK after being allowed in. Last year, for example, Intars Pless, 34, a convicted axe killer from Latvia, was jailed for ten years after mowing down and killing moped rider Valentina Planciunene in Boston, Lincolnshire. An APPEAL Court judge yesterday condemned the immigration ‘merry-go-round’ that allowed an asylum seeker to stay in Britain for more than a decade. The Pakistani was allowed to make 16 appeals or new applications despite being repeatedly rejected, at a cost to taxpayers of at least £250,000. Lord Justice Ward: ‘Here we have one of those whirligig cases where an asylum seeker goes up and down on the merry-go-round leaving one wondering when the music will ever stop. It is a typical case where asylum was refused years ago but endless fresh claims clog the process of removal.’ The 38-year-old man, whose identity was hidden by the court, arrived in Britain in August 1998. The Court of Appeal rejected his latest appeal – over the High Court’s decision to reject his demand for judicial review of a decision to remove him – and ruled he should now be returned to Pakistan. Lord Justice Ward said: ‘It is time the music stopped and the merry-go-round stops turning.’","Victor Akulic served eight years for sex attack on young girl .

Pay cut: Lord Patten, chairman of the BBC Trust, said the corporation's . next director-general will be paid substantially less than the current boss . The BBC will ‘substantially’ cut the salary of its next  director-general, it was claimed last night. Lord Patten, the chairman of the BBC Trust, admitted that the broadcaster has already started a search for someone to fill its most senior role. But he revealed the chosen candidate would be paid significantly less than the £671,000  given to current director-general Mark Thompson. Although Mr Thompson, who has held the position since 2004, has not announced any plans to leave, there have been rumours he will step down after the London 2012 Olympics. Lord Patten said an international head-hunting firm, Egon Zehnder, had already been appointed to produce a ‘succession plan’ by Easter. He added: ‘It does not warrant the headline “Starting gun  fired for Mark Thompson succession”. ‘They are going to give us a report on what sort of people we should be looking for. They are not seeking a candidate.’ And he revealed that he believed Mr Thompson would  be able to stay in the role as long as he wished. Lord Patten spoke as he prepared to give evidence today to the Leveson inquiry into Press standards, along with Mr Thompson. The former Conservative Party chairman said he did not agree with statutory regulation of newspapers. Remuneration: Current director-general Mark Thompson earns £671,000. However he has not announced any plans to leave . He said: ‘It’s a more open, responsible and self-confident society that doesn’t give politicians any opportunity to prevent the accountability which goes with an interrogative, investigative press.’ And he was also quick to  defend journalists who did ‘things which flirted with the illicit’ if there was public interest in the story. Lord Patten has often spoken of the need for reform at the BBC since he took over as chairman in June last year. At the time, he said that he would take action over the ‘toxic’ issue of executives’ high wages and cut the number of senior managers from around 530 to about 200 by 2015. He added: ‘Licence fee payers don’t expect the BBC to pay  sky-high commercial rewards to people that work for a public service.’","Current director-general Mark Thompson earns £671,000 ."
"By . Reuters Reporter . Last updated at 10:05 PM on 21st January 2012 . Former Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour's grants of commutations or pardons to more than 200 prisoners, all but eight in his final days in office, disproportionately benefited white offenders among a predominantly black prison population, a Reuters analysis found. Barbour, a former Republican National Committee chairman, stirred an uproar in Mississippi last week by the surprise grants of clemency, which numbered far more than any of his recent predecessors' in a state where law and order are hallmarks of political rhetoric. The list included full pardons for four convicted murderers and an armed robber who worked at the governor's mansion on prison work release. Most of the pardons were granted to convicts who had completed their prison sentences. Clemency: Mississippi Gov Haley Barbour kicked up a hornets nest in his state when he pardoned 221 convicts, including four murderers . 'It is, to say the least, . astronomically unlikely that Barbour's selection was color-blind,' said . Rob Warden, executive director of the Center on Wrongful Conviction. 'Now whether that's Barbour's fault or . the review board's fault, is a different question. It was somebody's . fault. It's not color-blind.' Mississippi's attorney general has filed a complaint alleging that 156 of the pardons were unconstitutional. A state judge has scheduled a hearing for Monday. Overlooked in the controversy has been the racial composition of the list of inmates and ex-convicts Barbour pardoned. Barbour granted 222 acts of clemency in his tenure to 221 individuals: one convict's sentence was initially suspended in 2008 and he then received a full pardon last week. Of those, roughly two thirds were white, according to data from the Mississippi Department of Corrections and a search of public records. The racial makeup of Mississippi's prison population is the inverse: about two-thirds' black. Whites make up about 59 percent of the state's population as a whole and blacks about 37 percent. Barbour said through a spokesperson that race played no factor in the decisions. 'A majority of the clemency cases were reviewed by the Parole Board before being sent to Governor Barbour,' Barbour spokesperson Laura Hipp told Reuters. 'Race was not a factor in his decision. In fact, it wasn't even listed on the Parole Board's application.' Disproportionate: Fewer than a third of the pardons Barbour handed out were given to blacks, despite the fact that they make up nearly two-thirds of the prison population . Regardless of the underlying reason, such a disparity between the racial background of those pardoned and prison demographics is a significant statistical anomaly, according to University of Georgia statisticians Kim Love-Myers and Jaxk Reeves, who carried out an analysis of the data for Reuters. 'This type of observational information cannot prove causality, though it does indicate a significant relationship between race and the probability of being pardoned,' Love-Myers wrote in an email. 'The odds of a random sample of the prison population coming out with the same or greater disparity in racial proportions as the pardons list is less than one in a trillion, if race were truly unrelated to pardons.' Jimmy Gurulé, Notre Dame Law School professor who served as assistant U.S. attorney general under former President George H. W. Bush and also worked in former President George W. Bush's administration, said the disparity could have implications beyond Mississippi. 'At the very least, those numbers raise some very disturbing questions that need to be addressed by the attorney general and even by the U.S. Department of Justice civil rights division,' Gurulé said. 'It should be made absolutely clear that ethnicity is not a factor in determining who should be pardoned. It would be a violation of the equal protection clause. It would be a violation of the U.S. Constitution as well as the Mississippi constitution.' Shannon Warnock, chair of the Mississippi Parole Board, said no data on the race of people who applied for clemency was available because that was not required on the application form. 'I can't remember there being any disparity,' she said. 'This parole board has been reviewing inmates black and white and Hispanic. I'm in my eighth year, another board member's in her eighth year and we see a variety of offenders. That, candidly, is just not something that we - that I factor into my decision-making process.' DISPARITY COULD REFLECT 'MANY CAUSES' The pardons process begins with an application to the governor's office, which can then direct the Parole Board to investigate any applicant. The minimum criteria for clemency applications, laid down in an internal memo from Barbour in 2004, require that applicants be seven years out of custody without committing a crime or can prove mitigating circumstances for their crimes. Ms Warnock said the board received more than 500 applications during Barbour's eight-year tenure. Of those, just over 250 met the required standards for consideration and were sent on to the governor's office. Among the applications forward by the Parole Board, Warnock calculated that Barbour granted clemency to 185 applicants and denied it to 69 others. Jack Glaser, associate professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley, said the racial disparity, while dramatic, may have more complex underpinnings than simple racial prejudice. 'There's also a very good chance that black prisoners are less likely to apply for pardons,' Mr Glaser said. 'They're more likely to be disenfranchised and less likely to have financial means and so that could also be a source of the disparity. I guarantee that this disparity has many, many causes.' When asked about any possible racial disparity in the pardons process, veteran Jackson, Mississippi, criminal lawyer Merrida 'Buddy' Coxwell said: 'I don't think anyone will ever admit wealth and race play a role in the legal system but no one who works in the system can deny it with a straight face and then go home and have a peaceful night sleep.' Jackson attorney Rob McDuff experienced the clemency process that led to former Governor Ronnie Musgrove reducing in 2002 the eight-year sentence of one of his clients, Deanna Elizabeth Wade, convicted of manslaughter. Mr McDuff said no formal process existed to file for clemency petitions. But he said it helped to have an attorney file paperwork on the applicant's behalf. 'It's a process where having money to hire a lawyer and having connections are very helpful,' Mr McDuff said. 'It helps to have facts about your case and your record that make a commutation appropriate, but that's not enough by itself.' The Parole Board's Ms Warnock said, however, she had seen very few applicants use attorneys in the pardons process. 'There was no need for one,' she said. 'It's user-friendly. It's exhaustive but it's not the kind of work that requires an attorney. You don't have to go and file, you don't have to do some research, you just have to do some legwork.' 'NOT COLOR-BLIND' Ms Love-Myers and Mr Reeves also found that based on Mississippi's prison demographics, white prisoners were about four times more likely to be pardoned than black prisoners. That echoes a recent examination of presidential pardons under President George W. Bush by public interest non-profit news organization ProPublica. In an analysis released last month of 1,918 applications for pardons during Bush's administration, ProPublica found that white criminals seeking presidential pardons were nearly four times more likely to get them than minorities. Last week, Mississippi Circuit Judge Tomie Green issued an injunction blocking the release of 21 inmates who had been given pardons or conditional medical release. Attorney General Jim Hood, the only Mississippi Democrat to hold statewide office, told reporters last week most of the pardons may have violated a state constitutional requirement that notice be posted in the community where the convicts committed their crimes well in advance of their pardons and release. Attorney General's Office spokeswoman Jan Schaefer said they were not looking at race as a factor in the pardons. The new governor, Republican Phil Bryant, who was Barbour's lieutenant governor, has taken steps to distance himself from his longtime ally. He publicly dispensed with the tradition of pardoning felons who have worked at the governor's mansion and said he supported the push to change the state's constitution to limit a governor's pardon rights.","Haley Barbour says his clemency choices were colorblind .

"By . Andy Whelan . Last updated at 2:18 AM on 22nd January 2012 . Premiership  footballer Robbie Keane is among dozens of players who invested in a collapsed investment scheme associated with a former player. The  ex-Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool striker, who has built up a £13 million fortune and is on loan to Aston Villa from David Beckham’s US club LA Galaxy, put £20,000 into the fund. Last week The Mail on Sunday revealed how former Coventry City player Michael McIndoe approached stars seeking investors. A £20,000 gamble: Robbie Keane, pictured with wife Claudine, invested in a suspected Ponzi-style fund which collapsed at the end of last year . He told them it was a ‘guaranteed-return investment scheme’ which promised to deliver 20 per cent a month on their capital. But the scheme collapsed at the end of last year and there are fears the players were victims of a Ponzi-style scheme. In such a fund, money from new investors is simply redistributed to existing members, rather than being invested to generate returns, with the result that the scheme eventually collapses. Mr McIndoe, 32, and his girlfriend, glamour model Emma Frain, live in a £2.8 million apartment in Eaton Square, Belgravia, one of London’s most exclusive areas. Neighbours include Joan Collins and Roman Abramovich. Approached rich investors: Michael McIndroe in action for Coventry in Febraury 2010. He told fellow stars the fund would give 'guaranteed returns' The couple moved into the second-floor luxury apartment several months ago. A source said that before moving into the apartment, Mr McIndoe paid security consultants £3,000 to ‘sweep’ the property, checking for radio signals and to see if phone lines and furniture were bugged. A neighbour said the couple have two French bulldogs which barked so loudly that the building’s management visited them 16 times. Mr McIndoe has not been seen at his apartment since the end of last week. His Bentley Continental, which he recently had repainted, has also disappeared. Before moving to the apartment, Mr McIndoe spent about three months living in the nearby five-star May Fair hotel. There he met a number of players seeking to make investments. A top international at a leading Premiership club said: ‘One young player who invested tried to withdraw his money but found he couldn’t, and a senior professional helped him get it back. This is what sparked the collapse, as lots of players got concerned and then tried to get their money out and couldn’t. Those players who have invested smaller amounts they can afford – £10,000, £20,000 or £30,000 – are washing their hands of it. It’s staggering – it was cash for cash, there were no receipts.’ A source claimed footballers at Mr McIndoe’s former club Coventry City invested £1.3 million. Last week's report by the Mail on Sunday . It is alleged one Coventry player invested £750,000 and his family are making vigorous efforts to get the cash returned. The player’s agent said he was looking into the matter. A Coventry City spokesman said: ‘We will be talking to the players’ representatives.’ Players from Wolves and others from Villa are also said to have invested. Both clubs declined to comment. Companies House records show Mr McIndoe became director of a number of businesses last year, including a concierge business aimed at footballers which promised exclusive access to nightclubs and private jets. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by Mr McIndoe. One of Mr McIndoe’s companies is carrying out the refurbishment of the Maya nightclub in Soho,  a haunt of celebrities including Lady Gaga. Last night Mr McIndoe did not respond to messages left on his phone, and there was no answer at his Berkeley Square office. Miss Frain declined to comment when she was contacted at her mother’s home in Stoke-on-Trent.","Ex-Liverpool striker ploughed £20,000 into investment fund .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:01 AM on 23rd January 2012 . A former cruise liner crewman is under investigation over fears he molested child passengers. The man is suspected of carrying out sexual assaults on youngsters over five on Cunard’s flagship Queen Mary 2 and its sister vessel the Queen Elizabeth. The alert was raised by the parents of a child who claimed to have been assaulted. Luxury: Trips on the 151,000-ton Queen Mary 2 (above), which was launched in 2004, can cost up to £120,000 . Prestigious: The £400million Queen Elizabeth, launched in late 2010, charges as much as £5,000 for a 13-night Mediterranean cruise . Police have contacted parents across Britain over fears there may have been many more victims. The inquiry was opened in secret six months ago by detectives in Wiltshire where the suspect lives. Police have interviewed him and searched his home, seizing computer equipment. A Cunard spokesman said: ‘We are deeply shocked by these allegations.’ Police in Wiltshire, where the unnamed man lives, have contacted parents in various parts of the UK whom they want to interview. Cunard – part of the Carnival cruise company that owns the sunken Italian ship Costa Concordia – has also asked the children’s  charity, the NSPCC, to speak to  worried parents who may require counselling and advice. Nobody has been arrested or charged over the allegations. Inside the QM2: The cavernous Britannia restaurant which can seat 1,347 guests in two sittings . Another world: The QM2 even had its own planetarium . But police sources confirmed to The Mail on Sunday this weekend that the ex-cruise worker – who left the company before the police probe began six months ago – has been interviewed by Wiltshire CID. Detectives are understood to have examined photographic and computer equipment at the man’s home. The investigation, which began last summer, has taken so long because of the delicate nature of the allegations and the fact they involve young children. Cunard bosses, headed by the  company’s president and managing director Peter Shanks, have launched their own inquiry into the allegations, which officials said had ‘deeply shocked’ them. Inside the Queen Elizabeth: The main lobby with its elegant staircases . Treated like royalty: The Queen Elizabeth boasts its own theatre . Company managers are understood to be reviewing Cunard’s strict vetting procedures, which are carried out on every applicant and include criminal-record checks. Cunard refused to say what role the former cruise worker had  carried out on its ships, but he is known to have been a low-ranking employee who had regular, close contact with passengers on board. The 151,000-ton Queen Mary 2, which entered service in 2004 and is as long as 41 double-decker buses, employs 1,253 crew and accommodates 2,620 passengers. Passengers pay between £1,200 and nearly £4,000 a head for a seven-day transatlantic cruise from Southampton to New York. Round-the-world trips are available with a top price of about £120,000. Stars who have travelled on the QM2 include The Who’s Roger Daltrey, Dame Shirley Bassey, John Cleese, Carrie Fisher and Jane  Seymour. Right royal approval: Both vessels were launched to great fanfare by The Queen . Queen Elizabeth, the newest of the Cunard fleet, launched in late 2010, is much smaller than the QM2, at 90,900 tons. It can take 2,068 passengers and has 1,005 crew. The Elizabeth boasts luxury cabins and ornate lounges. The cost of a 13-night Mediterranean cruise, excluding return flights, is between £1,700 and £5,000, depending on the grade of cabin required. Famous passengers on the Queen Elizabeth have included Sir David Frost. Both the Queen Elizabeth and the Queen Mary 2 were launched in a blaze of publicity by the Queen but the man under investigation has never met her, according to Cunard. A Wiltshire Police spokeswoman said last night: ‘We can confirm we are investigating historical allegations of child abuse by an employee of Cunard cruise liners. Inquiries continue. The employee no longer works for the company.’ A Cunard spokesman said: ‘We are deeply shocked by these allegations as the safety and wellbeing of our customers is of paramount importance to us. ‘A thorough police investigation is under way which we are supporting and co-operating with fully.’","Police tipped off by parents of one of the alleged victims .

"By . Meghan Keneally . Last updated at 2:23 PM on 21st January 2012 . Construction workers who were working on Madonna Badger's Connecticut mansion before it burned down in a tragic Christmas Day fire are being repeatedly questioned by police in the criminal investigation of the fire’s five deaths. Michael Borcina is a contractor who had been renovating the five-bedroom $1.7million house that was owned by his girlfriend Miss Badger. Ms Badger’s three daughters and her parents all died in the early morning blaze. Stamford police have questioned all involved- including Mr Borcina and Ms Badger- in order to learn details about the fire. Police told the New York Post: 'We’re trying to accelerate this and hopefully have something [to release to the public] within the next week and a half, two weeks.' They have concluded that it was sparked by some still-hot embers from the fireplace that Mr Borcina placed in a garbage in the mudroom after Ms Badger’s daughters asked for the fireplace to be cleared on Christmas Eve to make way for Santa. Loss: Mrs Badger arrives with Mr Borcina. They were the sole survivors of the blaze that destroyed her home . At the time of the fire, the mansion was still under construction, and though it did have a fire alarm system in place, it was not installed and working at the time. Mr Borcina’s company, Tiberias Construction, has been heavily scrutinized during the investigation as well, and it was discovered that several required forms were missing. The house did not have a new certificate of occupancy since the Badgers moved in, and Mr Borcina’s contracting licenses had expired at the time of the fire. His contractor registration for work in the state of Connecticut expired in 2000, and his home improvement license for the state of New York expired in June 2010. Mr Borcina has hired Eugene Riccio, a high-profile criminal defence attorney, to represent him in this case, but this is not his first run in with the law over his construction sites. House of horror: Authorities are investigating if the home had activated fire alarms and contractor permits . Victims: . Lomer and Pauline Johnson, seen standing, also died in the fire. Mr . Johnson died trying to save their grandchildren, from left, . Lily, Grace and Sarah. Another grandchild Morgan (right) was not in the . house . Greenwich Time reports that he owes almost $100,000 in from previous legal judgements, and is also in the midst of two other lawsuits from clients- one in Manhattan and one in Long Island. Police have officially ruled out any foul play in the investigation into the Badger home fire, but are now looking to see if there are any accidental criminal charges that will be filed. Specifically, charges of criminally negligent homicide or reckless manslaughter are both possible charges in a case like this. Because the house was torn down immediately after the fire, at the request of the local fire department which deemed it a continued safety risk, investigators are not hoping to find any evidence at the scene. Grief: Matthew and Madonna Badger embrace as the casket of one of their daughters arrives for the funeral services. Madonna is . comforted by Michael Borcina, who survived the fire that killed her children and parents . Instead it is more a matter of what steps were taken to ensure the safety of the home before anyone started staying there. Fire Chief Antonio Conte said the fire was Stamford's deadliest since a 1987 blaze that also killed five people. The fire killed 7-year-old twins Grace and Sarah Badger, 9-year-old Lily Badger and grandparents Lomer and Pauline Johnson. Mr Johnson was a department store Santa Claus who had worked as safety director for a Louisville, Kentucky, company. Mr Borcina appeared at Ms Badger’s side- along with her ex-husband and his current girlfriend- at the January 5 funeral for the three girls.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:09 AM on 23rd January 2012 . A former NYPD officer who was sentenced to three years’ probation last week for tagging his nickname to an overpass in Queens says the latest graffiti isn’t his, though his checkered past says otherwise. Steven Weinberg, a 44-year-old retired officer, spent much of the 1980s vandalising walls and subway cars with his art. But Weinberg, who suffers from nerve damage from an injury sustained on the job over a decade ago, uses a cane to get around and says the latest bout of graffiti – which is in the middle of a highway overpass - isn’t his. Ex-cop by day, vandal by night? Steven Weinberg, who was forced out of . the NYPD due to a leg injury in 2001, was put on three years probation . Problem picture: This tag appeared in 2009, and has since been the heart of the City's case against Steven Weinberg, saying it shows that he is still active . Weinberg was convicted last week of putting his tag, Neo, along a Queens overpass in Bayside in 2009, but he insists it was a copycat. ‘I never admitted to doing this,’ he told the New York Post. ‘I never denied I used to do it, but I didn’t do this graffiti on the highway.’ The former officer, now married with a wife and young daughter, told the New York Daily News at his hearing last week that he stopped doing graffiti after he joined the force in 1995. The judge, however, didn’t believe his plea. ‘I know that you’re in chronic pain,’ Supreme Court Justice Salvatore Modica said. ‘I understand what you’re going through. It does not excuse the criminal behaviour.’ All over the place: Neo's tags have been spotted on walls, trains, and trucks . According to the News, prosecutors said Weinberg bragged about the tagging on a MySpace page. Back in the 1980s, when the city was full of graffiti artists and squeegee men, crime ran rampant on the streets of New York. Weinberg said that at the time, sloppy security allowed he and other artists to roam the streets and subways ‘like it was a playground at Mickey D’s.’ Regardless, he said he enjoyed the thrill, as well as the artistic aspects, not the drug culture that is often associated with graffiti. Around the corner: Neo started tagging in his neighbourhood of Queens . He receives an annual disability pension of $38,000 a year. Weinberg retired in 2001 after sustaining serious nerve damage to his leg. He was forced to pay a $700 fine at his sentencing last week. The judge also ordered him to participate in a programme in Brooklyn which teaches art history and how to use graffiti productively. The programme is called ‘Paint Straight.’ He told the Post: ‘I believe in rehabilitation. I think you cause more problems in society when you give people convictions on something like this, when you could have them contribute to society instead.’ With his work: The website Subway Outlaws served as an outlet for Neo to speak about his work, shown in a fuzzed-out photo here .","Steven Weinberg was prominent graffiti artist in 1980s .

Unemployed young people need to learn lessons from the hard-working immigrants who have taken their jobs, Boris Johnson said last night. The Mayor of London said that the younger generation are missing out on jobs because they do not have the same ‘energy to go out and get them’ as the foreigners being employed in this country. Speaking a day after youth unemployment broke records, Mr Johnson said that there are vacancies, but British young people do not have the right work ethic. 'Get to work': Boris Johnson said that there are around 30,000 mid-market and lower-skilled vacancies in London alone . He pointed to successful sandwich chain Pret a Manger, noting native Londoners are rarely seen behind the till. ‘London is a fantastic creator of jobs – but many of these jobs are going to people who don’t originate in this country,’ he said. ‘They are hard-working, good people, and we need to learn from them and understand what it is that they have got that makes them able to get those jobs that young Londoners don’t have.’ Figures released earlier this week showed that more than one in five of those between the age of 16 and 24 are unemployed, hitting a total of 1.04million. Phenomenon: Pret a Manger is a successful sandwich chain which employs mainly foreign staff . But Mr Johnson, who is hoping to beat Ken Livingstone in the mayoral race in May, said that there are around 30,000 mid-market and lower-skilled vacancies in London alone. He said: ‘There are large numbers of job vacancies. Why are young people not taking up those jobs? How can we help them? That is the key problem for our economy. ‘In this city there are jobs going. It’s vital that Londoners have the skills and the aptitude but also the energy and appetite for work as well.’ He went on to suggest that British young people do not have the same determination as many of the foreign workers in hotels, coffee shops and shops in this country. ‘Let’s talk about work ethic,’ he said in the interview with The Sun. ‘I don’t want to stigmatise young people because many of them do have the aptitude.

An Indian schoolteacher thought he had become a billionaire after finding $9.8bn in his account - only to discover it had been put in his account by mistake. Parijat Saha could not believe his eyes when his State Bank of India account in West Bengal credited him online with 490bn rupees, making him a billionaire on paper. But rather than attempt to spend his new-found wealth, Mr Saha called his bank and was disappointed to learn the funds were put there through a bank error. Embarrassed officials at the State Bank of India would not comment on how the huge sum ended up in Mr Saha's account, but said that as the funds were 'uncleared' he could not have withdrawn the money anyway. The honest teacher had expected his balance to be around $200, as he earns a monthly salary as a school teacher in West Bengal of 35,000 rupees ($700 or £450). Mr Saha's temporary bank balance is closer to India's annual education budget of $11.5bn. Mr Saha, who lives in the town of Balurghat in South Dinajpur district, told the BBC: 'On Sunday evening, when I was checking my savings account balance on the internet, I was expecting an amount of a little more than 10,000 rupees ($200). The State Bank of India have refused to explain how the huge fund ended up in Mr Saha's account . 'I called up a friend in the bank and joked, maybe money is overflowing in your bank, that's why your system has remitted so much money into my account. 'Even though I got my money back, the account still holds the billions of dollars as uncleared amount. I don't know how long I'll have to keep that astronomical figure in my account.' Subhashish Karmakar, chief manager of the State Bank of India's branch in Balurghat, would not comment on the incident or explain how the funds got into Mr Saha's account. The bank's regional headquarters in Calcutta and national headquarters in Mumbai have been alerted and officials are trying to figure out what went wrong, sources in the bank say.","Parijat Saha found 490bn rupees in bank account .

As he struggled to keep her alive, a passer by phoned for an ambulance and other people helped perform CPR on her. Thanks! Glenn Jackson stands at the roadside with his large sign after passers by helped save his wife after she collapsed in his arms . Mrs Jackson collapsed suddenly after suffering ventricular fibrillation - a severely abnormal heart rhythm. Despite being declared clinically dead by ambulance officers who arrived at the scene in Scoresby, Melbourne, she pulled through and now Inspector Jackson wants to thank everyone who came to her aid. With his sons Tom and Mitch, along with Tom's girlfriend Hayley, he stood at the spot where his wife had collapsed clutching the sign so that passing motorists and cyclists saw it. 'It was like the worst feeling in my life, times 100,' said Inspector Jackson as he recalled the moment when his wife collapsed. With their dog's leash in one hand, he used his other hand to brace her fall as she started to drop. A cyclist pulled over to help, held on to the dog and also called for an ambulance. Then a couple stopped and helped with CPR, taking instructions from an emergency operator. Ambulance official Patrick Donaldson told Melbourne's Herald Sun newspaper that Mrs Jackson was clinically dead when paramedics arrived. 'We shocked her four times before her heart started beating again,' he said. A few days later Mrs Jackson was taken out of an induced coma. Two weeks after the drama, she is now well enough to correspond with friends on Facebook. 'Without the help of those people who came to her aid, she wouldn't be here,' said Inspector Jackson. Anxious to find those who helped, he has stood patiently at the roadside with the sign, hoping that the unknown Good Samaritans will stop so he can thank them personally.","Leanne Jackson was 'clinically dead' after collapsing with heart condition .

On July 6, 2011, the last few seconds of a comet's dive into the sun, when it evaporated in the heat above the star's surface, were caught on camera for the first time. Comet-watchers were astonished. No one had expected to be able to see the final moment, even with today's best orbiting space observatories. 'Comets are usually too dim to be seen in the glare of the Sun’s light,” says Dean Pesnell project scientist for Nasa's orbiting Solar Dynamics Observatory. 'We’ve been telling people we’d never see one in SDO data.' The comet flies across the surface of the sun. Sky-watchers were astonished - most comets are too dim to be detected against the sun's glare . But an ultrabright comet, from a group known as the Kreutz comets, overturned everybody's ideas. The comet can was seen moving over the right side of the Sun, disappearing 20 minutes later as it evaporates in the searing heat. Watching the comet’s death provides a new way to estimate the comet’s size. The comet turns out to be somewhere between 150 and 300 feet long and to have about as much mass as an aircraft carrier. 'Of course, it’s doing something very different than what aircraft carriers do,' says Karel Schrijver, a solar scientist at Lockheed Martin in Palo Alto. 'It was moving along at almost 400 miles per second through the intense heat of the Sun -- and was literally being evaporated away.' The comet was detected on July 4, so Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory was able to train cameras on it as it approached the sun . Scientists at the Lockheed Martin Solar and Astrophysics Laboratory at the Advanced Technology Center in Palo Alto, discovered the comet on July 4, 2011, by using the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph on the ESA/Nasa Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). It was the SOHO discovery that alerted Lockheed Martin scientists to watch data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory's cameras for the comet's likely transit across the face of the Sun.'This unprecedented passage of a comet through the solar atmosphere in view of our AIA cameras presented us with a remarkable opportunity,' said Dr. Karel Schrijver, lead author of the Science paper. 'As we witnessed this comet evaporate as it traversed a known amount of space over a specific period of time, we were able to work backward to estimate its mass just before it reached the Sun. We’ve been able to bracket its size as between 150 and 300 feet long, with a greater likelihood that it lies at the upper end of that range. And it most likely weighed in at as much as 70,000 tons, giving it about the weight of an aircraft carrier, when it first became visible to AIA.'As the comet streaked into the solar atmosphere it had already fractured into many large pieces ranging in size from 30 to 150 feet. The pieces were embedded in the nebulous envelope made up of ice, dust, and gas called the coma, surrounding the comet’s nucleus. The coma was estimated to be about 800 miles across, followed by a glowing tail approximately 10,000 miles long. The tail was seen pulsing from dim to bright to dim again during the journey across the Sun, which suggests that there was further breakup of the individual chunks of comet . Eventually, the comet evaporated completely.'I think the light pulses in the tail were one of the most interesting things we witnessed,' said Schrijver. 'The comet’s tail gets brighter by as much as four times every minute or two. The comet seems first to put a lot of material into that tail, then less, and then the pattern repeats. 'Only because of these pulses can we measure how fast the tail falls behind the comet as its gases collide with those in the Sun’s atmosphere. And that, in turn, helps us measure the comet’s weight.'","First time cameras have captured the way a comet 'dies' - most are too dim to be seen in sun's light .

"By . Claire Bates . Last updated at 7:45 PM on 20th January 2012 . An insurance scheme for cosmetic surgery patients could be introduced in the wake of the breast implant scandal. Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, who is leading a government review into the risks from faulty breast implants said the scheme would protect consumers. He said today that he favours a protection fund, paid for by the industry, that could be drawn on if the industry hits trouble or another major scandal erupts. However, there are fears that cosmetic surgery companies will simply pass the costs on to patients, in the form of higher bills for treatments. Protesters gather outside The Harley Medical Group on January 14, after they refused to replace their faulty breast implants. The Government is now looking at compulsory insurance schemes . Around 40,000 women in the UK received . implants manufactured by the now-closed French company Poly Implant . Prostheses (PIP), which were filled with non-medical grade silicone. Although there is no clear evidence PIP implants cause harm, the Government has said anxious patients who had their surgery on the NHS will be able to have the implants removed and replaced free of charge. If there is a clinical need, the NHS will also pay to remove, but not replace, implants if a private clinic refuses to do so or no longer exists. Sir Bruce said: 'As part of the . review, I am keen to work with the cosmetic surgery industry to find a solution . which offers protection and help to women when implants unexpectedly . fail.' The Harley Medical Group (HMG), which fitted . PIP breast implants to almost 14,000 British women, and Transform are . among the private firms which have refused to replace the implants for . free, despite the Government saying private clinics have a moral duty to . look after their customers. Sir Bruce Keogh is leading a government review into PIP implants . Sir Bruce, who is medical director of the NHS, said the scheme under consideration would be similar to the insurance protection scheme in place in the travel industry. He told BBC Radio 4's The Report: 'One of the things that my review will be looking at will be something rather like the Abta arrangement that travel agents have, which means that if an organisation runs into trouble the consumer is covered.' Companies pay a subscription to become members of Association of British Travel Agents (Abta), which provides a fund for people to fall back on if something goes wrong. Sir Bruce said this model 'captured the flavour of where we want to go'. A breast implant registry could also be reintroduced to record details of all operations, it was reported. It comes a week after Mel Braham, chairman of HMG, said he wanted the taxpayer to foot the bill to help its patients. Mr Braham said his . firm had been made a ‘scapegoat’ in the saga and was the victim of a . conspiracy by other surgeons who want to see him out of business. He . said the chain of 31 clinics, like its patients, was an ‘innocent . victim’ of a regulatory failure, and said it was ‘outrageous’ of the . Government to call on private clinics to take responsibility. The . group, which had a turnover of more than £30million in 2009, fitted . around one in three of the 45,000 PIP implants sold across the country. The chain is currently deluged with around 2,000 calls a day from women, most of whom want their implants removed. Mr Brahman's comments caused fury among MPs, patients, surgeons and lawyers, . who say a clinic’s first duty is to its patients, not its profits. Anntina suffered burning and stabbing pains . When Anntina Maughan had her breasts enlarged, she was thrilled with the results. Now, four years later and pregnant, the mother of two couldn't be more unhappy with them. Scans show that one – or both – of the PIP implants have ruptured. But, at five-and-a-half-months pregnant, Miss Maughan, 39, of Crawley in West Sussex, has been advised against surgery to have them out. Miss Maughan paid Harley Medical Group £5,000 for breast augmentation after enduring years of low self-esteem due to her small bust. Last year she started experiencing burning pains, and then found lumps in her breasts, raising fears of cancer. She now suffers stabbing pains – but has been advised not to have the ruptured implants out when pregnant. Miss Maughan believes the Harley Medical Group should pay to remove and replace the implants after she has her baby. She added: 'It is their fault this happened. I went there in full confidence. If it was up to me, I'd have the implants out right now. I worry because I don't know what was in them.'","Government review considering cosmetic insurance that would work like travel agents' Abta scheme .

"By . Sadie Whitelocks . Last updated at 4:46 AM on 20th January 2012 . A three-year-old girl has been refused life-changing treatment on the NHS, leaving her family outraged. Evie Tucker is unable to walk unaided as she was diagnosed at birth with cerebral palsy, a neurological condition which causes problems with movement and coordination. In a bid to help their daughter, Evie's parents applied for corrective surgery, but healthcare bosses have refused to fund the £23,000 operation, available just miles away at a local hospital. Evie Tucker, aged three, has been refused life-changing treatment on the NHS leaving her family outraged . The Tuckers are now desperately trying to raise funds for the operation, known as a selective dorsal rhizotomy, which could see Evie walk for the first time. Her mother Karissa Skidmore, 28, from Avonmouth, Bristol, said: 'Without the surgery she will not be able to walk by herself. 'She has a walker, which she probably manages about ten steps with before she gets really tired so mainly she crawls around.' 'I want Evie to have the . surgery as close to her fourth birthday in March as possible as she is . not at school yet and it will not interfere with that. Evie can only manage a few steps with the aid of a walking frame . 'I can see in her face how frustrated she gets at . not being able to join in with her friends walking and dancing and will . make a difference to all of us as a family.' Evie was delivered ten weeks early after her mother suffered a fall. She spent her first seven weeks . in the neonatal intensive care unit at Southmead Hospital, Bristol, . where brain scans revealed that she had cerebral palsy. While she can do many of the . things that her peers can, she can only crawl or walk a few steps with . the aid of a walking frame. But her mother came across a new type of surgery which could help her daughter get back on her feet. The operation involves cutting nerves . in the spinal cord to overcome the tightening of muscles that makes it . difficult for many with cerebral palsy to walk. Previously the treatment was only available in the U.S. but Ms Skidmore was delighted when she discovered that a local hospital was one of the first to offer the service in the UK. The family applied immediately through their local NHS. However a funding panel refused the application stating that . Evie’s case was not strong enough. The family are now facing the challenge of raising the funds themselves. A letter from NHS Bristol said: 'The . panel agreed that there is a small but significant cohort of patients . who may benefit from this new developing procedure. Cerebral palsy is a general term used by doctors to refer to a set of neurological conditions that affect a child's movement and co-ordination. Caused by damage to the brain, which normally occurs before, during or soon after birth. Symptoms vary greatly from child to child - some children have problems walking, while others are profoundly disabled and require lifelong care. Related conditions or problems, include epilepsy, learning difficulties, hearing impairment, delayed growth and a curved spine . It is not a progressive condition - meaning it will not get worse as a child gets older - however, it can put a great deal of strain on the body, which can cause problems in later life. There is no cure but a range of treatments can help relieve symptoms. 'They had not been . supplied with sufficient evidence to demonstrate that Miss Tucker has . the potential to benefit over and above other patients with a similar . condition for whom this treatment is also not currently available.' The family appealed against . the initial decision, but now they are focused on fundraising to pay for . the treatment on a private basis. Ms . Skidmore, who also has a five-month-old son, Jack, with partner Dan . Tucker, added: 'This is a postcode . lottery - they are saying the treatment is not available to other . children but it is to those in other parts of the country.' Since last May, when the surgery was first introduced at Frenchay Hospital, Bristol, 12 operations have been carried out by consultant neurosurgeon Kristian Aquilina, who learnt the technique at St Louis Children’s Hospital in the U.S. As the only hospital in the UK currently offering the procedure, referrals have come in from across the country, with most being paid for by the NHS. A further 14 children have been assessed by Mr Aquilina and had funding refused by their local NHS trust. A spokesperson for the primary care trust said: 'Unfortunately, the need for healthcare services usually exceeds the resources available. 'We cannot always provide NHS funding for all of the treatments that patients request.' It is estimated that 1 in every 400 children in the UK is affected by cerebral palsy and 1,800 babies are diagnosed with the condition each year.

A public school housemaster who seduced a vulnerable 16-year-old pupil and became so infatuated that he bought her an ‘engagement ring’ was jailed yesterday. Married Mark Westcott, 48, would take the girl for drives following evening ‘prep’ after they began an affair during a school ski trip. The design and technology teacher, who was the girl’s housemaster, engaged in sexual acts with her inside a school room, in his car and at a Travelodge hotel. Jailed: Married Mark Westcott had sex with one of his female students in a classroom. He began the affair with the teenager when she was just 16 . He first targeted her by sending . explicit text messages and pictures of himself naked after she turned to . him for pastoral support. His victim, now 17, who cannot be . named for legal reasons, later told police he had bought her a ring and . began referring to her as ‘Mrs Westcott’. Westcott, a father who had taught at . the school in the Bath area of Somerset for 20 years, was jailed for 16 . months and told that he would never be able to work with children again. He had pleaded guilty to three counts of sexual activity with a child while in a position of trust. Judge Douglas Field said the . teacher’s life was ‘in ruins’. Westcott has lost his job and is . separated from his wife Deborah, who was in court yesterday. The victim’s mother spoke of ‘being taken in’ by Westcott in extracts from a letter read to Swindon Crown Court. It read: ‘As a family I feel we have . all been taken in by him. We absolutely trusted him and thought he . provided pastoral support during her difficult times. We never thought . he would cross his professional boundaries.’ Breach of trust: The affair began when the girl was aged 16 and taking her GCSEs in Year 11 at a school in the Bath area . The court heard the two first began . sending each other text messages after swapping numbers when she was in . Year 11,  and had approached him for pastoral support. The pair then began exchanging explicit text messages – swapping naked pictures of themselves while he was on holiday in France. But the relationship turned physical . on a skiing trip early this year and police began to investigate after a . tip-off from a fellow pupil at the school. Westcott’s victim initially refused . to co-operate, but later confessed to the consensual affair after . officers discovered emails between them detailing their activities. Prosecutor Siobhan Linsley told the . court: ‘The text messages became less innocent over time and by  the . summer of this year the pair were sneaking around at school and began . meeting up.’ They had first met for sex when Westcott booked a room for them both at a Travelodge hotel in August this year. The court also heard that the pupil . had performed a sex act on the teacher after they went for an evening . drive in his car after ‘prep’ class in October. Mrs Linsley added: ‘In September he . gave her a ring that  she considered to be an engagement ring and he . called her Mrs Westcott.’ However in the autumn the relationship began to cool as the girl began seeing someone else. ‘She had a boyfriend near her own age . and that shocked the defendant,’ Mrs Linsley said, adding that they had . been arguing because he ‘could not bear her being with someone else’. Judge Field told Westcott, from North . Wraxall, Wiltshire: ‘You formed an entirely inappropriate relationship . with a pupil of yours who was 16 and became 17. ‘This was a very serious breach of trust. She was a pupil and  you were her teacher  and housemaster. ‘You were responsible for her pastoral care. ‘In breach of that this relationship developed into an extensive sexual relationship. This is a very, very, serious case.’ He added: ‘You are a man who, until the early months of  this year, had an impeccable character. ‘It is amazing to everyone, including . me, that at the age of 48 you behave in this entirely inappropriate . way. Your life is in ruins. ‘The fact is that girls like this need protection. She was vulnerable.’ Charles Row, defending, said calling the pupil ‘Mrs Westcott’ had been a joke. Mr Row told the court that Westcott ‘is ashamed for his failure of resolve, self-control and will’. He added: ‘He has lost his reputation, his family, his home, his career, his livelihood and his pension’.","Pair first slept together in a Travelodge hotel and also had sex in room next to school sports hall .

This is the miracle baby who survived six months of chemotherapy in his mother’s womb after she defied doctors and refused to have a termination. Stephanie Papworth was just 12 weeks pregnant when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Doctors suggested terminating the pregnancy as they didn’t think the baby would be able to survive the aggressive treatment. But Miss Papworth was determined to give her baby a chance of life and refused. Her miracle baby endured months of chemotherapy while in the womb and defied all the odds to be born healthy. Stephanie Papworth, pictured with her son Gabriel, was diagnosed with breast cancer when she was just 12 weeks pregnant, but refused to have a termination . And Miss Papworth has just been given the all-clear herself after a year of treatment. The 34-year-old said: ‘He really is my little miracle - every time I look at him I feel so blessed. I can't believe he survived all this time in the womb whilst I was having chemotherapy.' Miss Papworth, who lives in Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire, was just 12 weeks pregnant when she discovered a lump in her left breast. She said: ‘As soon as I felt it, I just felt sick with fear. It was a hard marble-sized lump and even though I was so young, I was so worried that it was breast cancer. I tried to push it to the back of my mind and convince myself it was a harmless lump.’ Miss Papworth went to see her GP who told her it was probably nothing to worry about, but she referred her to the breast clinic in York for further checks. She underwent an unltrasound and biopsy three days later and doctors delivered the devastating news to her that it was a grade three aggressive breast cancer. She said: ‘I just felt numb, I was so shocked. All I could think of was the baby growing inside me and what would happen to it. ‘I didn’t want my baby growing up without a mother.’ The doctors told Miss Papworth that . her unborn baby may not survive the aggressive months of chemotherapy . treatment she needed to try and survive. She . said: ‘The doctors offered me a termination as they thought the baby . may die due to the treatment. But I was determined. I had already fallen . in love with my baby and I wanted to give it the best possible chance . of survival. It would mean that we were both fighting for our lives.’ Miracle baby: A scan showing Gabirel in the womb, three months before he was born . Miss Papworth, who also has daughter Maisie, ten, and son Jacob, 12, underwent a four hour operation at Bradford Royal Infirmary to remove the lump. She said: 'I was so worried about the baby, whether it would survive the operation. When I came round, I only had a tiny bit of morphine so it wasn’t too much for the baby, so I was in a lot of pain. 'Then I had a scan to see if he was still alive, and when we heard the heartbeat and knew he had survived the operation, I cried with relief.' Miss Papworth then started on aggressive chemotherapy treatment. Without it, the doctors told her she would die. She said: 'I had no choice. I had to have the chemotherapy to stay alive, but I was terrified that it would kill my baby. ‘Some of my hair fell out, and I felt sick and exhausted, but my baby kept moving inside me, and gave me hope. Every kick that I felt just spurred me on.’ She had a scan every three weeks, and each time doctors said that the baby was still alive. Two weeks before the birth the chemotherapy finished, and Gabriel was born at the end of November 2010, weighing just 4Ib13. Miss Papworth, who is separated from her partner Richard Marsh, 38,  a plumber, said: 'When I actually held him in my arms I just couldn’t believe it, that he had survived through so much. It was the most amazing feeling.' Miss Papworth had to start another course of chemotherapy treatment when Gabriel was just two weeks old, which finished in March last year. She then underwent another four weeks of radiotherapy treatment, finishing in April. Since then she has had several scans, and recently she was finally given the news that she had been waiting for - that she was all clear from cancer. She said: 'It was the most amazing news I could hope for. I’m all clear from cancer and there is no sign of it coming back. 'Gabriel is doing really well too. Despite being premature he’s healthy and the doctors believe he has suffered no side effects from the chemotherapy.  He is an absolute miracle.'",Stephanie Papworth was 12 weeks pregnant when she was diagnosed .

Tragedy: Kerry Fitzsimons, left, and Eva Block, right, were both students at Marist College and living in a house off campus when they were killed in an early morning fire . Ms Fitzsimons, from Commack, Long Island, was studying Biomedical Science at the liberal arts college, according to her Facebook page. Her sister Colleen wrote: ‘My big sister, my guardian angel, I will love you forever, my Kerry Rose.’ Gone: Kevin Johnson, a 2008 high school graduate of New Canaan High School, also died . Friends and family posted to her sister Facebook wall expressing condolences. One woman wrote: ‘I’m so sorry to hear about your loss. My heart breaks for you. My thoughts and prayers are with you and your family.’ Family friends of 21-year-old Eva Block said she was a burgeoning designer who made her own clothes. ‘She was phenomenal at what she did,’ Philip Greenberg told the Poughkeepsie Journal. Police confirm that Ms Block died of smoke inhalation after an autopsy was conducted. The third victim was Kevin Johnson, a 2008 graduate of New Canaan High School in New York, according to friends and online reports, though his identity has not been confirmed by police. The official causes of death for Ms Fitzsimons and Mr Johnson will be released pending the completion of their autopsies. Marist College, a small liberal arts college home to around 4,200 undergraduate students is located in the town of Poughkeepsie, between New York City and the capital of Albany. The college said in a statement: ‘The Marist community’s thoughts and prayers go out to all those affected by this terrible tragedy.’ The college postponed two basketball games 'out of respect for the students affected by this tragedy,' Deborah DiCaprio, Marist's vice-president said in a statement. Students and members of the community held a vigil at noon on Sunday; another is scheduled to be held this evening. According to the Poughkeepsie Journal, which first reported the victim’s identities, four of the six students living in the 99-year-old house, along with three male friends, had gathered for a dinner party and went to bed shortly after midnight. Raging fire: The 99-year-old house at 112 Fairview Avenue in Poughkeepsie was fully engulfed in flame when fire fighters arrived . All that's left: Firefighters stand by the charred remains of the house Sunday, which is now covered in a light snow . At the time that the fire was initially reported to 911 by a passer-by at about 1.30am, police chief Thomas Mauro said seven people were in the house - four residents and three male guests. The police chief said the group had gone to bed about an hour before the fire appears to have started. 'There was no issue that they were aware of in the house when they went to bed,' he said, basing his comments on interviews with the four survivors. An eyewitness told the Poughkeepsie Journal that she saw a woman 'fly through' a windowpane on to the street, having been thrown by her boyfriend. Cause of death: Officials said Eva Block, of Woodbridge, Connecticut, died from smoke inhalation . 'All she kept saying was that her best friend was inside,' the passer-by said. The first fire-fighters arrived at the scene four minutes after the 911 call was placed and tried to get into the house, but were forced back by the heat and flame. One victim was found on the second floor of the house, one was downstairs and the third was under 'considerable collapsed debris,' the police chief said. The four survivors were taken to a hospital, where they were treated and released. They were treated for minor smoke inhalation and other minor injuries and were able to debrief police. Much loved: Kerry's sister Colleen posted this picture of her sister, writing: 'I'll love you forever' Studious: Kerry Fitzsimons was from Cormack, Long Island, and was studying Biomedical Science . The cause of the fire remains under investigation. Mr Maeder said the fire is believed to have started on the first floor. The remains of the house were bulldozed yesterday afternoon. The college is providing counselling to students, and has put up the people who survived the fire in additional housing. Services for Ms Block will be held on Monday in Connecticut, Mr Greenberg said. A community shaken: Marist College has an undergraduate population of around 4,200 students, who held a vigil Sunday . Another deadly fire struck a college campus in 2005. A house fire killed three students at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio after a blaze erupted in the first-floor living room. The three victims – all upperclassmen – died from carbon monoxide poisoning. There were 13 people living in the house at the time. The other ten escaped. The blaze started after smoking materials ignited a couch, authorities said.","Kerry Fitzsimons and Eva Block were both students at Marist College .

"By . Lauren Paxman . Last updated at 1:20 AM on 21st January 2012 . A recruitment crisis has forced hospitals to call in Army medical staff to run their accident and emergency departments. The national shortage of ‘mid-grade’ doctors – posts between junior doctors and consultants – means some hospitals have 30 per cent fewer staff than they need, figures show. This has led to NHS trusts being forced to close units overnight because there are not enough staff to ensure they are safely run. Desperate solution? Pontefract's casualty department in the Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust is shut from 10pm to 8am due to shortages in middle management doctors . Yesterday it emerged that Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust has called the Army Medical Service to ask for cover to try to restore a 24-hour emergency service. Pontefract Hospital A&E has, since November, been closed between 10pm and 6am due to a shortage of mid-grade doctors. Around 12,000 residents have signed a petition pleading for Pontefract A&E to be re-opened. Meanwhile, Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust has confirmed that, until last month, doctors and nurses from the Army and RAF had been working in its A&E. The staffing crisis has been blamed on soaring admissions caused by binge-drinking and patients unable to see an out-of-hours GP. Critics described the situation as ‘deeply worrying’ and blamed the Government’s controversial health reforms. Normal working conditions: Army medics tend to an injured Afghan soldier in Helmand province . Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham . said that in the past shortages would have been solved by Strategic . Health Authorities, which are to be scrapped. He said: ‘The dangerous decision to . dismantle existing NHS structures before Parliament has approved new . ones is exposing hospitals and patients to unacceptable risks. Essential . tasks such as workforce planning across hospitals, to resolve these . problems, have been disrupted. There is a loss of grip and focus at . local level.’ Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, . who is MP for Pontefract and Castleford, said: ‘It is deeply worrying . that two hospitals have had to seek help from the Army because of the . shortage of doctors and the Government needs to explain urgently why . they have allowed it to come to this and what action ministers will take . to deliver the doctors we need.’ Short-term solution: Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP for Pontefract and Castleford, described the trust's proposed solution as 'deeply worrying' Dr Taj Hassan, vice-president of the . College of Emergency Medicine, which provided the national shortage . figures, said fewer junior doctors wanted to specialise in A&E as . the departments have become increasingly intense. The number of admissions has soared in recent years and he pointed to the binge-drinking  culture, as well as patients not being able to see a GP whenever they want. Dr Hassan added that gaps in the rota were caused by a EU diktat stipulating junior doctors could only work a maximum of 48 hours a week . Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust confirmed two doctors and five nurses from the Army and RAF helped man Stafford Hospital’s A&E department between October and December. The trust has struggled to recruit staff in the wake of a care scandal which is thought to have cost the lives of up to 1,200 patients. Professor Tim Hendra, medical director at the Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, said there had only been ‘very early exploratory conversations with the Army’. It followed a review by the trust, Strategic Health Authority and Primary Care Trust, he added. ‘These doctors would be trained medical staff not on military service who could provide temporary support with our staffing rotas,’ he said. ‘This is only offered in exceptional circumstances.’ A Department of Health spokesman denied there was a shortage of doctors at Pontefract.","Pontefract Hospital has struggled to recruit middle-management doctors .

"36 Yak-130 aircraft could be delivered to Syria . Deal could cement Russian opposition to . international efforts to put pressure on Syria . By . Jill Reilly . Last updated at 5:35 PM on 23rd January 2012 . Russia has signed a contract to sell combat jets to Syria, a newspaper reported today, which if confirmed, is an open defiance of international condemnation of President Bashar Assad's violent crackdown. The revelations were broken by Russian newspaper Kommersant, which quoted an unidentified source close to Russia's arms firm Rosoboronexport saying the $550-million (£353.5 million) deal includes the delivery of 36 Yak-130 aircraft. A spokesman for Rosoboronexport refused to comment on the report. Contract signed: Business daily Kommersant said today that Russia had signed a contract to sell 36 Yak-130s to Syria in a show of support for President Bashar Assad's government . If confirmed, the deal would cement Russian opposition to international efforts to put pressure on Assad's regime over its attempts to snuff out the country's uprising. The U.N. says more than 5,400 people have died over 10 months. No comment: Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Moscow doesn't consider it necessary to offer an explanation over reports a Russian ship had delivered munitions to Syria . The Yak-130 is a twin-engined combat trainer jet that can also be used to attack ground targets. The Russian air force has recently placed an order for 55 such jets. The news of the apparent deal comes the same day that Human Rights Watch called Russia's backing of the Syrian regime 'immoral . Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said last week that Moscow doesn't consider it necessary to offer an explanation or excuses over suspicions that a Russian ship had delivered munitions to Syria despite an EU arms embargo. Russia was acting in full respect of international law and wouldn't be guided by unilateral sanctions imposed by other nations, he said. Lavrov also accused the West of turning a blind eye to attacks by opposition militants and supplies of weapons to the Syrian opposition from abroad and warned that Russia will block any attempt by the West to secure United Nations support for the use of force against Syria. Russia has been a strong ally of Syria since Soviet times when the country was led by the president's father Hafez Assad. It has supplied Syria with aircraft, missiles, tanks and other modern weapons. Igor Korotchenko, head of the Center of Analysis of the Global Arms trade, an independent think-tank, said the jet deal apparently reflected Moscow's belief that Assad would stay at the helm. 'With this contract, Russia is . expressing confidence that President Assad would manage to retain . control of the situation, because such deals aren't signed with a . government whose hold on power raises doubts,' Korotchenko was quoted by RIA Novosti news agency as saying: . 'It's . another gesture by Moscow underlining its confidence that Damascus will . remain its strategic partner and ally in the Middle East.' Protest: Demonstrators gather during a protest against Syria's President and Russia in Kafranbel after Russia, a veto-holding U.N. Security Council member, said it will prevent the council from approving any military intervention in Syria . Another . Moscow-based military analyst, Ruslan Pukhov, said, however, that . Russia might be too optimistic about Assad's prospects. 'This contract carries a very high degree of risk,' Pukhov told Kommersant. 'Assad's regime may fall and that would lead to financial losses for Russia and also hurt its image.' Human Rights Watch warned Russia that by supporting Assad it is repeating the mistakes of some Western governments during the Arab Spring, saying they were too slow to recognize the popular desire for democratic change in places like Egypt and Bahrain. Carroll Bogert, from Human Rights Watch, said at a news conference in Moscow today 'The continued support of this regime is immoral and not permissible,' 'Armed elements shooting at government soldiers is materially different from government representatives shooting deliberately at unarmed civilians,' Carroll Bogert, the group's deputy executive director, said at a news conference in Moscow that followed the release of HRW's annual report. She added that the overwhelming number of victims in Syria is on the side of the demonstrators. 'The continued support of this regime is immoral and not permissible,' Bogert said. 'The West has already made serious mistakes with the support of Arab regimes. Russia's repetition of those mistakes will lead to tragic consequences.' Refusal: Syria rejected an Arab League call for President Bashar al-Assad to hand over power to his deputy and form a national unity government with the opposition within two months . Meanwhile Syria has rejected an Arab League call for President Bashar al-Assad to hand over power to his deputy. Meeting in Cairo, the league also called on Syria to set up a new unity government within two months. 'Syria rejects the decisions of the Arab League ministerial council ... and considers them a violation of its national sovereignty and a flagrant interference in its internal affairs,' a government official said on state TV said. The league called on both sides to end the recent fighting, with the UN estimating more than 5,000 people have died as a result of the crackdown on protests since last March.","36 Yak-130 aircraft could be delivered to Syria .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:25 PM on 20th January 2012 . More cracks have been discovered in the wings of the world's biggest passenger jetliner but Airbus has insisted the aircraft are still safe to fly. The damage has been found in two more A380 superjumbos, just two weeks after tiny cracks were first reported in the wings of the 525-seat, double-decker aircraft, which entered service just over four years ago. The initial discovery led to Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association last week called for the aircraft to be grounded amidst safety concerns. Safety concerns: More cracks have been discovered in the wings of the world's biggest jetliner, the 525-seat, double-decker A380 superjumbo, but Airbus has insisted the aircraft are still safe to fly . 'Airbus confirms that some additional cracks have been found on a limited number of non-critical brackets ... inside the wings of some A380s,' the planemaker said in a statement. 'Airbus emphasizes that these cracks do not affect the safe operation of the aircraft.' The European Aviation Safety Authority (EASA) confirmed it would issue a bulletin Friday mandating precautionary checks. The latest cracking problem was discovered in two aircraft during a routine two-year inspection, an Airbus spokeswoman said. EADS subsidiary Airbus has so far delivered 68 superjumbos, starting with Singapore Airlines which took the first aircraft in December 2007, followed by Dubai's Emirates and Qantas Airways of Australia. Other operators include Air France, Germany's Lufthansa, Korean Air and China Southern. Reassurance: Airbus has emphasized that these cracks do not affect the safe operation of the aircraft . So big that many airports had to modify their facilities to accomodate it, the A380 was designed to challenge Boeing's monopoly of the large passenger aircraft market. The aircraft's upper deck extends along the entire length of the fuselage, allowing for a cabin space of 5,145 sq ft - some 49 per cent more than Boeing's 747, the next largest passenger jet currently in service. The A380 is designed for a range of up to 9,600 miles (15,400km), enough to fly from New York to Hong Kong, at a cruising speed of Mach 0.85 (560mph or 900km/h). However, since the first deliveries of the aircraft in 2007, the planes have already been plagued with a series of problems. A blowout in the superjumbos' Derby-built Rolls Royce Trent 900 engines led to an emergency landing of a Qantas A380 in November 2010. Qantas grounded its Airbus fleet for more than a fortnight after the midair explosion over Singapore, which was found to have been caused by a faulty pipe. Rolls subsequently admitted dealing with the fault, including replacing the engines on several aircraft, had cost it £56million. Even the A380's massive size has posed difficulties. Last June an Airbus 380 lost its wing-tip in a taxiing collision with a building at Le Bourget airport Paris. The collision mirrored an incident at JFK airport earlier that year when a private jet was spun round after it was hit by the wing of an A380. The latest problems were discovered in the same type of part as the earlier set of cracks, an L-shaped bracket which connects the wing's exterior to the internal 'rib' structure. A380 wings are manufactured in Broughton, north Wales, and Filton, near Bristol, before they are shipped to Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France, for final assembly. Each aircraft is powered by four Rolls Royce Trent 900 engines, built in Derby. In total, some 20,000 British workers' jobs rely on the construction of the mammoth planes. Industry journal Air Transport Intelligence said the brackets, known as rib feet, had been stressed during the manufacturing process and that this was being fixed. The A380 has enough room on its wings to park 70 cars and a wingspan of 79.8m (261ft 10in).","Wings are built in Broughton, north Wales, and Filton, near Bristol .

"By . Michael Seamark . Last updated at 1:55 AM on 24th January 2012 . Police have known for almost ten years that News of the World reporters hacked into Milly Dowler's phone, it emerged yesterday. The paper admitted to the Surrey force within a month of her disappearance that they had illegally intercepted the 13-year-old's voicemail messages. They claimed to have obtained her mobile number and PIN details from her schoolfriends. But despite the journalists' admission of criminal activity in April 2002, no action was taken against them. An individual from the newspaper . admitted to police in April 2002 that they had accessed the . voicemail of Milly Dowler, according to the Surrey force . Instead, the force invited two . journalists from the now-defunct Sunday paper to a private meeting at . the force's headquarters to discuss the case. Officers had been told that the . newspaper was planning to run a story claiming Milly had run away from . home and had allegedly contacted a Midlands recruitment agency. In fact, . the agency had simply dialled a wrong number and left a message on . Milly's mobile phone by mistake. News that Surrey police had sat on . evidence of hacking by the NoW since 2002 was revealed in a letter sent . by the force to the Culture, Media and Sport committee. MPs described the revelations as . 'sickening' and said the force faced 'serious questions' over what it . knew. Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee said: . 'Had they acted in 2002 ... it may have prevented the culture of hacking . becoming endemic at News of the World.' The letter from the police describes . discussions between the force and the newspaper over the story claiming . Milly had run away from home and was seeking work. The 16-page document – with key police . and journalists' identities redacted – does not address the crucial . question of who deleted Milly's voicemails and gave her parents false . hope that she might still be alive. Last month it emerged the messages . may have been erased automatically by her mobile phone provider. The police letter reveals that on . April 13 2002, the Surrey force was told that a recruitment agency had . received two phone calls from a woman claiming to be Milly's mother, . Sally, asking if her daughter was working for them. Culture Committee chairman John Whittingdale (left) said the letter appeared to show that several NotW journalists were involved in hacking the teenager's voicemails. Keith Vaz (right), chairman of the Home Affairs Committee said: 'The information provided by Surrey Police raises serious questions over what they knew about phone hacking and when' Staff at the agency had turned up to . find 'hordes of reporters from the News of the World waiting for their . arrival as they had been given the same info'. The agency said a NoW . reporter claimed he was 'working in full co-operation with the police.' The force document explains that a voicemail message had been mistakenly . left on Milly's phone by the agency. But by 'a pure coincidence' it was . not a message for Amanda – Milly's real name – but for a Ghanaian . called Nana. That message was accessed by the News . of the World, which became '110 per cent' sure that Milly had run away . from home and was looking for work. Throughout April 13 2002, the . newspaper spoke to detectives and press officers from Surrey police . making it clear they had a recording of the voicemail message. The newspaper said there were other . voicemail messages from 'a tearful relative, a young boy, and someone . saying “It's America, take it or leave it”.' Desperate search: Emergency services all joined the hunt for Milly Dowler after her disappearance . On April 20, the News of the World . played Surrey police the message left by the recruitment agency on . Milly's phone and three months later, two of the newspaper's journalists . met senior officers at Surrey police HQ. John Whittingdale, chairman of . the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said the police letter . suggested that several NoW journalists were involved in hacking Milly's . voicemails. Tory MP Damian Collins added: 'Of all . of the documents and evidence that have been produced by our . phone-hacking inquiry, this is the most sickening and exposes the black . hearts of those involved in perpetrating and covering up this scandal.' Last night a statement from the Dowler . family said: 'The release of the Surrey police statement is a further . reminder of the relationship between that force and the News of the . World. 'The report indicates that the police force were aware of a caller . purporting to be Sally Dowler seeking information in 2002. 'No doubt . there will be current investigations as to who that was as it was not . Sally Dowler. Surrey Police have not explained why they did not . investigate that deception in 2002.'","John Whittingdale, Commons Culture Committee chairman: 'What (the letter) appears to tell is that several journalists at the News of the World were involved in hacking the voicemails left on Milly Dowler's phone'

Astrid Herrenschmidt, the wife of the French education minister, was found dead at the couple's Paris home earlier this morning . The wife of France’s high-profile education minister Luc Chatel today committed suicide at the couple’s home in Paris. Astrid Herrenschmidt, 45 and the mother of four children, was found by her own mother early on Sunday morning. Mr Chatel, 47, who was not thought to be home at the time, ‘today confirmed the personal tragedy that happened this morning,’ said his chief of staff, Phillippe Gustin. ‘What happened should entail respect for the private life of his children, his family and for him,’ Mr Gustin added. The was no official confirmation about how Ms Herrenschmidt killed herself, although police sources at the town house in the upmarket suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt suggested her body was found hanging. Mr Chatel, who was born in Maryland, in America, had been married to Ms Herrenschmidt for 21 years, and she provided massive support for his political career. Not only was she hugely supportive as a wife, but Ms Herrenschmidt was a leather industry and asphalt mines heiress from the German border region of Alsace. Today police set up a security cordon around Mr Chatel’s house, as forensics offices examined the scene. Mr . Chatel is also a huge Anglophile who last year infuriated French . traditionalists by saying: ‘Not mastering English in France these days . is a handicap.’ Mourning: Luc Chatel, pictured with his wife at a function, confirmed her death via his chief of staff. The couple had been married for 21 years . Sealed off: An ambulance is seen outside the couple's apartment in Paris earlier today following the announcement of the death . He said that there were plans to teach three-year olds English with the help of computers – meaning that French children would start learning the language some eight years before English children learn French. Mr Chatel, who is a close political ally of President Nicolas Sarkozy, became education minister in France in 2010. He too comes original comes from an industrialists family, and at one stage in his career worked in marketing for French cosmetics giant L’Oreal. As a former spokesman for the ruling UMP party, he is seen as a key player in Mr Sarkozy’s bid to be re-elected this Spring.

Warning: IMF Christine Lagarde said the global economy faced a 'defining moment' in the battle to avert a rerun of the Great Depression . The world must act now to prevent a ‘1930s moment’ and a ‘downward spiral’ into economic catastrophe, the International Monetary Fund warned last night. IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said the global economy faced a ‘defining moment’ in the battle to avert a rerun of the Great Depression. She called for a ‘larger firewall’ to protect Italy and Spain from the debt storm raging in the eurozone. In a speech in Berlin, the former French finance minister also urged Germany – the biggest economy in Europe – to take a lead in tackling the crisis and shoring up the single currency. It came as European finance ministers met to try to thrash out a new deal to rescue Greece and stave off a debt default and the break-up of the euro. Gikas Hardouvelis, an adviser to the Athens government, warned that the 17-nation bloc would collapse if Greece leaves the currency. ‘If Greece is left to go, then the market will ask who is next and the eurozone will dissolve,’ he said. Brussels, meanwhile, appears to have abandoned plans for a 'Robin Hood Tax' on London. Michel Barnier, European commissioner . for markets, admitted that a new levy on banks cannot be imposed on the . UK against its will. He denied being in a 'plot' against the City of . London. Today, the Washington-based IMF will take the axe to its forecasts for economic growth around the world and warn that Europe is heading for a double-dip recession. Mrs Lagarde said: ‘We could easily slide into a 1930s moment, a moment where trust and cooperation break down and countries turn inward, a moment ultimately leading to a downward spiral that could engulf the entire world.’ She said 2011 was ‘a year in which so much of what could go wrong did go wrong’ – and laid the blame at the door of politicians in Europe and America. At an an EU summit last month David Cameron used the UK¿s veto of a 'fiscal compact' when he could not secure safeguards for the City of London. ‘We saw many false starts and half measures in 2011 – in Europe, but also, for instance, in the United States,’ she said. Mrs Lagarde added: ‘But what we must all understand is that this is a defining moment. It is not about saving one country or region. It is about saving the world from a downward economic spiral. The longer we wait, the worse it will get. The only solution is to move forward together. Our collective economic future depends on it.’ Mrs Lagarde said Europe must bolster its defences by increasing the size of its bailout fund. The IMF’s firepower must also be increased to $1trillion (£640billion) to help it fight the eurozone crisis. But this will anger Britain, the U.S. and China, who have argued that the single currency area should do more to prop up the euro before turning to the IMF.","IMF chief urges Germany to take the lead .

"By . Chris Brooke . Last updated at 12:59 AM on 24th January 2012 . ASBO: Pensioner Christopher Perry, 65, has been banned from talking to his vicar for a decade after leading an online smear campaign . A pensioner who used his blog to smear police, councillors and a clergyman in his neighbourhood has been given a ten-year anti-social behaviour order. Christopher Perry, 65, accused local police of corruption and threatened to 'bring down' the Methodist minister, who he branded a 'wheeler dealer'. His bizarre blog called Wolds Eye View  also called a former village mayor an Obergruppenfuhrer – a high-ranking SS officer. It is believed to be the first time a blogger has received an Asbo. Perry, a member of the National Union of Journalists, claimed to have previously worked as a local newspaper reporter and as a Home Office crime researcher. The self-styled community campaigner from East Yorkshire targeted figures in the village of Wetwang, where he lived, and the nearby market town of Driffield. As well as pestering and photographing the Rev Robert Amos, he targeted town councillor and former Driffield mayor Steven Poessl, ex-police inspector Richard Wood, and a local businessman, Hull Magistrates' Court was told. After complaints were made to police, he was officially warned about 'harassment' and his blog taken down by the authorities last year. In October 2009 he published an article on his website containing 'inaccurate information' about 'malpractices' he claimed had been committed by Mr Wood. Colleagues heard about the blog and it caused problems for his victim at work, the court was told. Ignoring a warning, Perry made further corruption allegations online that month and caused alarm to the victim's wife by contacting her. Mr Wood, now a town council clerk, denied all the claims, adding they were 'disgraceful and unfounded'. The court heard Perry began his inquiries when he was given a document said to have been written by a traffic warden accusing officers at Humberside Police of covering up a traffic offence by a councillor who ran a red light. He contacted Mr Wood and Mr Poessl about the claims. Perry's blog alleged that Mr Poessl . was the councillor involved, and also called him an Obergruppenfuhrer. Mr Poessl said the accusations were untrue and added that he was . 'insulted' by the SS reference as his father had been a mechanic in the . Luftwaffe. Hate campaign: Pensioner Christopher Perry has been banned from contacting Rev Robert Amos, who is based at the Driffield Methodist Church, East Yorkshire . The court also heard Perry told Mr Amos: 'I'm going to bring you down by the power of journalism.' Outside court, the clergyman said . Perry published 'ridiculous' claims that he stood to make millions from a . plan to rebuild his church. Mr Amos said: 'Nothing could be . further from the truth. He was also saying I was trying to make money . from the elderly and prey on them. 'He parades himself as a journalist rooting out fraud and that kind of thing, but what he was writing about was just silly.' District Judge Frederick Rutherford . rejected claims by Perry's lawyer that he had a right to freedom of . expression, telling him: 'It's a nonsense to hide such appalling actions . behind human rights. 'This is clearly anti-social behaviour.' Under the Asbo, imposed last Friday, . Perry is banned from causing harassment, alarm or distress or contacting . eight named victims. He faces jail if he makes any direct or indirect communication by 'any means whatsoever'. After the hearing, Perry said he was considering an appeal or applying for a judicial review. He said: 'This is a gagging order that . goes far beyond an Asbo. I think it gives a sign to other people not to . complain about things or challenge anything.'","Christopher Perry, 65, also used blog to accuse Humberside Police and councillors of corruption ."

After the hard-fought, violent and costly eviction of the Dale Farm illegal traveller camp, some may have thought the decade-long saga had finally reached an end. But as these pictures reveal, the battleground has merely moved a few yards away. They show that since Dale Farm was cleared in October at an estimated cost to the taxpayer of £18million, there has been an extraordinary explosion in the number of caravans pitched on the legal Oak Lane site next door. Taken over: The Dale Farm site, three months after its eviction, shows that while the illegal half on the right has been cleared, the number of caravans on the legal half next door has now swollen . Taken over: The Dale Farm site, three months after its eviction, shows that while the illegal half on the right has been cleared, the number of caravans on the legal half next door has now swollen . Eyesore: A picture taken on November 8, around three weeks after the original eviction shows how relatively quiet the legal half of the site was before travellers descended on it in recent weeks . Many are from the 90 that were removed from Dale Farm, in Crays Hill, Essex. Most of the travellers are thought to have relatives on the Oak Lane . site and began to return in the run-up to Christmas. The overcrowding is . so bad that it breaches planning permission, and Basildon Council is . preparing to serve eviction notices on half of the site’s 34 pitches by . the end of January. Notices are also set to be served on travellers parked on a private road . approaching the site and surrounding streets for breach of regulation. Staying put: Basildon Council revealed that many of the illegally parked caravans at Dale Farm belong to families who were evicted from the other half of the site last year . Over capacity: Of the 34 caravan pitches on the legal side of Dale Farm, around 50 per cent are said to be breaching planning conditions . Remnants: Doormats, mattresses and other discarded household items litter the road on the now empty side of Dale Farm . The notices would give the travellers 28 days to vacate the land. In an all-too-familiar echo of the battle for Dale Farm, the travellers . say they are determined to fight any council moves to evict them. One, who would give her name only as Kathleen, said: ‘We are going nowhere. When they serve the notices we will ignore them. ‘People are ready to fight for their homes again. It will be like . another Dale Farm situation all over again.’ Kathleen, 23, added: ‘They . may send in the police and the bailiffs but we will stay here.’ Fire fight: The Dale Farm site erupted into violent clashes when police and bailiffs moved to evict travellers late last year . Battle: Police rise up on a cherry picker during the peak of the eviction fight at Dale Farm last October . Len Gridley, who lives near the site, said: ‘I counted about 56 mobile . touring vehicles on the road leading to Dale Farm and crowded on to the . Oak Lane site. ‘But a lot of the people we see nowadays are new travellers who have turned up and not those who were there before.’ A total of 43 people were arrested and several injured after Dale Farm . protesters fought running battles with riot police in October in the . eviction of about 80 families from what was the UK’s largest illegal . traveller settlement. Legal fight: The Dale Farm camp near Basildon in September, as Basildon Council attempted to end their ten-year battle with travellers on the illegal site . A decade-long legal battle was declared a success and Basildon Council . announced that the six-acre site, which was built illegally on green . belt land, was clear. Council leader Tony Ball said of the latest developments: ‘It’s a . disappointment and a frustration but not completely unexpected that this . has happened. The fact that the law is now being broken means we will . move in to enforce it.’ But campaigner Mary Anne McCarthy, who lived on the Dale Farm site for . ten years, said: ‘There will be another Dale Farm stand-off, there is no . doubt about it. The travellers have nowhere else to go and this is . their home. They will fight for their homes and livelihood. ‘Tony Ball will have to try and evict us all over again. And that will cost too much.’","Caravans park on site next to illegal Essex settlement .

"By . Claire Bates . Last updated at 1:37 PM on 22nd January 2012 . Under fire again? NHS reforms introduced by Health Secretary Andrew Lansley (pictured on Tuesday) are expected to be criticised by an influential cross-party group of MPs . Health Secretary Andrew Lansley's controversial NHS reforms are set to be heavily criticised by an influential cross-party group of MPs, it was reported today. The Commons Health Committee are expected to say this week that the proposals were obstructing efforts to make the NHS more efficient and failed to address the needs of an ageing population. The committee, chaired by Conservative former health secretary Stephen Dorrell have concluded the plan to restructure the NHS in England and devolve more power to GPs has made it more difficult to achieve the target of £20 billion in efficiency savings by 2014-15. According to The Observer, a ""late draft"" of the committee's report as says: 'The reorganisation process continues to complicate the push for efficiency gains. 'Although it may have facilitated savings in some cases we heard that it more often creates disruption and distraction that hinders the ability of organisations to consider truly effective ways of reforming service delivery and releasing savings.' Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said it was now clear Mr Lansley's reform plan had been a ""monumental mistake"" and called for a government rethink. 'This report is a damning indictment of the Government's mishandling of the NHS,' he said. 'It is time for David Cameron to listen to what doctors, nurses and now his own senior MPs are saying and call a halt to this reckless reorganisation.' Health Minister Simon Burns, however, insisted the Government was determined to put the NHS on a sustainable footing. 'We all know the NHS is facing pressures from an ageing population and the increasing costs of medicines. That's why we are spending an extra £12.5 billion on the NHS. We have also made £7 billion in efficiency savings as performance has improved,' he said. 'These will all help in the short term, but if we are to put the NHS on a sustainable footing for the future reform is essential. Our modernisation plan will put doctors in charge, slash bureaucracy and give much more power to patients.' Legitimate question: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg told Andrew Marr today that NHS reforms had been scaled back but that change was needed . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said it was a ""legitimate question"" for committee to look at how the changes affected the ability of the NHS to meet spending cut targets set by the last Labour government. However, he warned reform in the NHS was necessary and the Government could not 'stick our head in the sand and say 'no change'. 'We have gone a long way to allay the concerns that people had about the original blueprint of the reforms,' he told BBC1's The Andrew Marr Show. 'We have said there is going to be no privatisation of the NHS by the back door. We have put competition back in its box. We have made sure there is proper accountability in the NHS. 'But people shouldn't think that the best way to cherish and preserve everything that we love about the NHS is somehow to freeze it in time and then it will all be okay. 'Our view is that these reforms, by making people in the front line more responsible for use of NHS money, actually help make the savings, not hinder it.' NHS Confederation chief executive Mike Farrar said: 'I am deeply concerned about the financial pressures facing the healthcare system in this country and the impact this will have on patients. 'The full implications of this remain poorly understood outside the NHS, partly because politicians are reluctant to stand up and explain them. 'If we are to keep the NHS sustainable in the long term, we need to be honest that this will mean fundamentally reorganising they way we deliver care in the best interest of patients. 'Some local hospital services will need to close or move into larger specialist centres. We also desperately need to strengthen care provided in the community. 'This is so we can provide better care to the people who make up the vast majority patients in today's health service: older people with various long-term conditions. 'I passionately believe that the overall impact can be positive for patients, but only if we can get ahead of the curve and take the public with us.' 'From the outset, we have made clear that the government's reforms to the administrative structures of the NHS are a distraction in terms of addressing these fundamental challenges. 'We are therefore increasingly worried by the lack of clinical support for the reforms and the fact that clinical opposition to the changes has hardened in recent days.'","You can't restructure NHS and make cuts at the same time, committee expected to say ."
"By . James Slack and Damien Gayle . Last updated at 11:05 AM on 29th June 2011 . Inquiry: UKIP MEP for the North West Paul Nuttall wants an investigation into two Merseyside NHS Trusts . An MEP has demanded an inquiry into claims two Merseyside hospitals passed on confidential patient medical records to ambulance chasing lawyers. Paul Nuttall, UKIP MEP for the North West, said he had heard complaints from constituents bombarded with messages from personal injury law firms after hospital treatment. The claims have emerged as insurance company AXA UK announced it would no longer accept referral fees from law firms and called for reform to whiplash damages. 'AXA hopes this action is a first step in a journey to reform the emerging compensation culture which is spiralling out of control and encourages Government to ban referral fees completely,' the company said in a statement. The developments come the day after the Daily Mail revealed that police are raking in millions of pounds from selling on the  details of drivers who have had a road accident. A Mail investigation found that police officers are often the first link in a chain of tip offs and kick backs as police, insurance companies, unscrupulous lawyers and breakdown firms conspire to exploit powerless motorists. UKIP MEP Mr Nuttall demanded an inquiry into the Wirral and Royal Liverpool Hospital NHS Trusts after he was approached by constituents who feared their confidentiality had been breached in the same way. 'The only way the claims firms can have got the information that they had been a patient and also got their mobile phone numbers is from the hospital itself,' he said. 'I don't know if that is being done with the connivance of the hospital trusts concerned - Wirral and the Royal Liverpool Hospital - or whether some staff are doing this off their own bat. 'But I want to know and this must be stopped. I know that hospital trusts everywhere are having to make budget cuts but if they are selling this highly private information to boost their coffers it is an outrage and must contravene the Data Protection Act.' Misfortune turned to profit: Police, insurance companies unscrupulous lawyers and breakdown firms apparently conspire to exploit powerless motorists. (Stock image) AXA's announcement over payments from personal injury lawyers came as anger over the effect the UK's growing 'compensation culture' has had on car insurance premiums bubbled over today. The insurer, one of the world's largest, singled out the problem of compensation for whiplash injuries - which are almost undetectable. In particular, they highlighted the unscrupulous practice of motorists being encouraged to make claims several years after an accident. After such a long time has passed it is almost impossible to verify what injury has been sustained, particularly when no injury was claimed at the time. Paul Evans, Group CEO, AXA UK, said: 'As one of the leading insurance providers, we have decided that the only way to address the problem adequately is to lead by example. 'Over the last few years we have seen an exponential rise in personal injury claims – especially soft tissue injuries – whilst evidence suggests road accidents are decreasing. 'We have also seen a significant rise in claims made some years after the event which are therefore impossible to prove or to defend.' 'Racket': Police are raking in millions of pounds from cynically selling on the details of drivers who have had a road accident (file photograph) Yesterday the Daily Mail revealed . police forces were running a 'huge racket' in which they cynically sell . on the  details of drivers who have had a road accident. Officers . tip off preferred local garages and breakdown firms - who come to . collect the car, then hit motorists with removal and storage charges. For this service, the police demand a so-called 'administration fee' of up to £25 per vehicle. Details of this and other dubious practices emerged amid a blazing row over the way police, insurance companies, unscrupulous lawyers and breakdown firms conspire to exploit powerless motorists. Insurers blame unnecessary police charges and the compensation culture - which has seen damages claims for trivial or imagined injuries spiral - for the soaring increases in the annual premiums they charge all drivers. But they too stand accused of being deeply involved in the racket. According to ex-Justice Secretary Jack Straw, insurance companies are selling details of their own clients to 'no-win, no-fee lawyers' for up to £1,000 per person. These 'claims managers' then bombard the motorist with unwanted texts and phone calls offering to help them to pursue compensation claims for often non-existent injuries. Some 80 per cent of all claims are for 'whiplash' which is conveniently undetectable by scans or X-rays. The cost of settling the spiralling . bill for personal injury claims is immediately passed on to the driver . in higher premiums - while insurers are allowed to keep their lucrative . 'referral' fee. Mr . Straw said yesterday that the entire system had become a 'huge racket' and that the insurance industry saw it as 'our dirty little secret'. He added: 'The garages, the recovery firms - even the police are selling on this information.' The . Information Commissioner receives 100 complaints every month from . motorists bombarded with phone calls and texts urging them to claim . compensation. Christopher Graham has begun an investigation into whether the tactic is a breach of data protection laws. Insurers . are expected to defend themselves by pointing out that, on insurance . renewal forms, they warn that a client's personal information could be . passed on to  'relevant third parties'. Mr Graham wants to establish if this could reasonably be understood to mean claims handling companies. If he decides it does not, insurers could be found in breach of the Data Protection Act. The . police tactic of obtaining referral fees from local garages is legal . because they insist that the information goes no further. Garages are told they will be in breach of the Act if they contact any third party. The police's role was revealed in evidence to the Transport Select Committee, obtained by Mr Straw. It shows that, when a car cannot be . driven away from the scene of an accident, police who arrive quickly . make a call to a local garage or breakdown company. Forces, who have agreed a fee in advance, then receive a 'tip off' or 'referral fee ranging from £5-£25. In one year, West Midlands Police . raked in an estimated £622,275 from contractors' tip-off payments, in . relation to 24,891 vehicles. Greater Manchester Police' referred' 32,855 cars to breakdown companies in 2009, but refused to reveal the . amount it received, claiming disclosure could 'damage the commercial . interest of third parties'. Police claim the money is necessary to cover 'admin' fees - but not all forces choose to charge a fee. The evidence was compiled by the insurer swiftcover.com, using Freedom of Information requests. It approached nine forces - only two . of which said they did not charge a 'referral' fee for arranging the . collection of cars involved in an accident or unfit to drive after . breaking down. Based on these figures, more than . three-quarters of the 54 forces in England, Scotland and Wales are . likely to be pocketing a fee. The value to the police could be tens of . millions of pounds. In evidence to MPs, swiftcover said: . 'When the insurer is told about the collection, it has to arrange a . further collection of the vehicle from a recovery centre, owned by a . third party. 'This incurs additional, unnecessary costs to the insurer and therefore policyholders.' They say drivers should themselves call the insurance company, to avoid police getting in first. Police say they ensure the garages agree not to pass on the details of motorists to other companies. But claims managers say there is evidence of garages ignoring these rules, despite it being a breach of data protection law. Incredibly, the tactics being used by the insurers themselves are legal. Buried away in the small-print of insurance documents, motorists are . asked to agree for their details to be passed on to 'relevant third . parties'. Insurers have taken this to be a . green-light for them to sell the names and other personal information of . a crash victims to a claims manager for £200-£1,000. Claims firms then encourage crash . victims to make compensation bids for injuries such as whiplash, even . when they have not been hurt, according to the investigation by Mr . Straw. The motorist can receive a pay-out of thousands of pounds - but premiums are driven up. Research: MP Jack Straw found insurance companies selling details . In 2009, the number of road accidents involving personal injury was 31 per cent down on the average for 1994-98. But the cost of personal injury . claims has doubled in ten years - from £7billion to £14billion - and . motor insurance premiums have shot up, by at least 30 per cent in the . last year. Mr Straw wants the 'referral' fees . banned. He says insurers have admitted to him that the fact they are . charging 'referrals' is the industry's 'dirty secret'. But yesterday insurers remained . defiant - saying they will carry-on selling drivers' personal data until . such time as a ban is imposed. The Association of British Insurers . Nick Starling, said: 'If they [insurers] stopped taking this money, . everyone else would be taking it - which is why they have to be banned . outright.' Nicholas Jervis, of solicitors . LoyaltyLaw.com, said: 'Finally someone has realised it is the insurance . industry who have been screwing the system more than anyone else.' The Association of Chief Police . Officers said it was down to individual forces to decide how much they . charged, but they were doing nothing wrong. But Andrew Wigmore, spokesman for the . Claims Council - a trade body representing 120 claims management firms - . said: 'We are aware police officers, nurses, doctors, ambulance men and . women have sold details of accident victims to claims management . companies.' ACPO insisted: 'We do not sell the details of people involved in accidents to compensation lawyers.'","Insurance company AXA announces it will stop accepting fees from personal injury lawyers .

Their shops sell some of the cheapest products on the high street. But the owners of budget chain 99p are now set to make a fortune as they put their business on the market for £60milion. Nadir Lalani opened the first shop in Holloway in 2001, but now has nearly 150 outlets following an aggressive expansion that has seen it move into dozens of former Woolworths stores since the chain's collapse in 2008 at the start of the economic crisis. The squeeze in consumer spending has increased demand for its cut-price products, which range from Panasonic batteries to four cans of apple Tango, all selling for 99p or less. Its rival Poundland has also been one of the retail success stories since the recession. The Lalani family last year put it up for sale and had originally wanted £80 million, according to the Independent on Sunday. But a price tag of between £50million and £60million was now understood to be more realistic. Private equity firm Electra Partners . is thought to be the forerunner to buy the firm, but a number of rivals . are also reported to be interested. If a buyer is found, it is believed that . managing director Hussein Lalani and buying director Faisal Lalani - . Nadir's sons - will stay on to run the business. A sale would see 99p Stores follow in the . footsteps of its rival Poundland which was sold for £200million to . private equity firm Warburg Pincus in 2010. 99p Stores plans further expansion after . more than trebling pre-tax profits to £6.3million in the year to January . 31, driven by rising sales and improving margins.

Cashing in: The company has taken advantage of the consumer squeeze by offering a wide range of products from batteries to cans of Tango for knock-down prices . The Northampton-based firm aims to have . 600 stores within the next decade, which would see it have sales of more . than £300million and 5,000 employees. It recently opened a new store format called Family Bargains which is not restricted to selling items for 99p or less. According to the store's website, 99p stores were founded by Nadir Lalani in January 2001 when he opened his first store in Holloway, London and continued to open 3 more stores that year. The website says: 'In 2002 Nadir . decided to expand the business throughout the whole of the UK.

"By . Katie Silver and Emily Allen . Last updated at 7:41 PM on 24th January 2012 . On the run: Murder suspect John Anslow escaped from a prison van earlier today . Police are hunting a dangerous prisoner after he was sprung from a prison van by a gang of masked men armed with knives and sledgehammers earlier today. John Anslow, who faces a murder charge after a father-of-two was shot dead with a sawn-off shotgun as he lay in bed, was being driven to Stafford Crown Court when the vehicle was ambushed by three men at around 8.20am. The gang smashed the windscreen of the GEO Amey escort vehicle before punching the driver and threatening him with a knife. They then escaped with 31-year-old Anslow in a silver Volkswagen Scirocco, . The car was found dumped around ten miles from the scene of the ambush. It is believed the gang switched to a silver Mercedes. The ambush took place on a narrow, secluded road in Tardebigge, just outside Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, shortly after the vehicle had left HMP Hewell Grange. Two other prisoners in the van were not released. Anslow, who is from the Tipton, was charged with the murder on January 18. He is described as white, 5ft 10ins tall, of medium build, with short straight dark brown hair. Detective Inspector Jon Marsden of West Mercia Police said: ‘Three men wearing balaclavas, two of whom were carrying sledgehammers, got out of a silver Volkswagen Scirocco, and smashed the windscreen and driver's window of the GEO Amey prison escort van. ‘The van driver was punched but no serious injuries were sustained by escort staff. The Scirroco drove off at speed. The group are believed to have switched to a silver Mercedes car in Stoney Lane, Bromsgrove, soon after. Roadblock: Police stop traffic at a nearby junction as a second prison van - possibly collecting the remaining prisoners - drives past . Police block the roads leading to Hewell Grange Prison in Redditch, after the prisoner's escape . Hewell prison houses more than 1,400 inmates across three blocks holding category B, C and D prisoners. Det Insp Marsden added: ‘Anslow has . recently been charged with murder and is considered dangerous. 'We are . working closely with our colleagues from West Midlands and Staffordshire . Police forces and a large number of officers from all three forces are . involved in the search for him. 'However we would urge any members of the . public who sees him not to approach him directly, but to contact police . immediately on 999.’ Killed: Anslow is charged with murder after Richard Deakin was shot dead in his bed . Police were still at the scene of the ambush this afternoon. The road was roped off with tape and helicopters could be seen circling the area. A resident, who did not want to be named, said: 'It's like something out of a movie. Everybody is very worried at the moment. 'There's a murder suspect on the lose and we are a very small and tranquil community. We have never known anything like this.' A spokeswoman for prisoner escort . firm GEO Amey said: 'Following an incident this morning, we can confirm . that two employees were threatened and one sustained facial injuries. 'Both were treated by paramedics at the scene. 'They continue to assist West Mercia Police with their investigations.' Mr Deakin died after being shot twice while at home in Chasetown, Staffordshire, at about 8.30am on July 5, 2010. His partner Megan had left the house to take their two daughters to school when the gunman struck. It is believed Mr Deakin may been targeted for being a police informant - a claim that is refuted by detectives. Officers made various appeals for information following his death, including a feature on the BBC’s Crimewatch programme and the offer of a £20,000 reward for information about his killing. In December 2010 they also issued CCTV . images of the skip hire boss’s suspected killer. The dramatic footage showed the moments before the cold-blooded hitman, . armed with the weapon in a plastic bag, stormed in to his home before . shooting him dead. In an earlier interview, Carol Deakin opened her heart over the anguish . she and her family endure on a daily basis. She said: 'Whoever was . responsible, whoever is punished, it will never bring Richard back. If I . had one wish, it would be for Richard to be here today. 'We are normal people and this isn’t supposed to happen to normal . people. I only ever saw this sort of thing on a film because we have . never been surrounded by violence. 'You don’t get over it. You bury it and hope time will let you bury it . further. This has ripped us all apart. He had two beautiful children who . adored him. They talk about him all the time. Wanted man: Anslow poses with a dolphin for a family picture. Police have warned members of the public not to approach him . Manhunt: Anslow escaped in a silver Volkswagen Scirocco before transferring to a silver Mercedes . Murder: Anslow is one of five men to be charged over the death of Mr Deakin . 'They see stars in the night sky and say it’s their dad looking down on them.” Darryl Dickens, 33, David Harrison, 62, and Andrew Hill, 49, and  Leigh Astbury, 31, have also been charged with Mr Deakin's murder.' Anslow is the fourth prisoner to escape from custody in recent years. Last July, the trial of an alleged . criminal gang which used guns and grenades to intimidate its rivals . collapsed after two defendants escaped from a prison van on the edge of . Manchester city centre. The gang made off and an international search was launched for the two men, with ports and airports in the UK monitored. And . in September 2006, a 'violent and dangerous' criminal escaped from a . prison van in Redditch after being helped by two masked men armed with . with a gun. Two men wearing balaclavas, or with . their faces covered, used a firearm to threaten staff in a security van . taking the prisoner back to Blakenhurst prison following an appearance . before magistrates in Redditch.

"By . Daniel Miller and Rob Cooper . Last updated at 11:14 AM on 24th January 2012 . Poison victim: Linda McDonagh, 60, died after her saline drip was poisoned at Stepping Hill Hospital, Stockport . Police have named two more suspected victims of the hospital insulin poisoner. John Beeley, 73, died on Friday and grandmother Linda McDonagh, 60, died earlier this month. They are two of 21 patients thought to have been deliberately poisoned on wards A1, A2 or A3 – which care for seriously ill patients – between June 1 and July 15 last year. Mrs McDonagh, who had a serious motor neurone disease, was treated at the site last summer. The former office administrator at an NHS clinic was diagnosed two-and-a-half years ago and her condition had been getting progressively worse. She was being treated for pneumonia last summer when her blood sugar levels 'dropped dramatically', according to her devastated husband Stewart. He said doctors removed her saline drip and replaced it with another which 'brought her back' and she recovered 'within minutes'. After surviving the visit, she had a relapse and was back in Stepping Hill on January 7 with another bout of pneumonia. She was put on a 'non-invasive ventilator' but later decided to remove the mask and died on January 14. Mrs McDonagh lived with her car mechanic husband in Offerton, Stockport. They have two daughters and a son as well as two grandchildren. 'She was the best mother anybody could ever wish for,' said her daughter Amanda Thorley. Police are investigating whether insulin poisoning was a factor in Mrs McDonagh's death. The coroner's office have been informed and tests are due to be carried out. A 60-year-old woman is believed to have become the fifth person to have been deliberately poisoned at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport, Greater Manchester . Arrested: Victorino Chua, 46, who was held in connection with the murder of three patients . Officers are continuing to probe the . deaths of multiple sclerosis sufferer Tracey Arden, 44, Arnold . Lancaster, 71, Derek Weaver, 83, and Bill Dickson, 82, a former senior Daily . Mail journalist, who all died after suffering ‘hypoglycaemic episodes’ – . a dangerous drop in blood sugar levels. A saboteur is believed to have spiked saline solution with insulin at the hospital. The alarm was . first raised by hospital staff on July 12 when a higher than normal . number of patients were reported to have 'unexplained' low blood sugar . levels. However, police have described the investigation as very complex - and are having to examine a bewildering 700 people who could have contaminated saline fluids at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport. Earlier this month male nurse Victorino Chua, 46, was arrested in connection with the murder of three patients – Tracey Arden, 44, Arnold Lancaster, 71, and Derek Weaver, 83. He was bailed until April. He was also arrested on suspicion of 18 counts of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. Fellow nurse Rebecca Leighton, 28, spent six weeks in jail following her arrest in the investigation. She was released and cleared of any wrongdoing last September when prosecutors said there was not enough evidence against her. Victims: Alfred Weaver . Tracey Arden . Arnold Lancaster . Victim: Bill Dickson, a former Daily Mail journalist, who died after suffering a 'hypoglycaemic episode' Announcing the latest death, a spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said today: 'The woman, who was one of a number of patients who police believe suffered hypoglycaemic episodes between June and July 2011 after being administered contaminated products at Stepping Hill Hospital, died in the early hours of Saturday 14 January. 'The coroner has been made aware and further tests are ongoing.' The family of Mrs McDonagh, from Offerton, Stockport, have said they do not wish to comment. Police chiefs have previously stressed that detectives have not yet established the degree to which deliberate contamination of products may have contributed to the patients' deaths. They added that about 650 people have already been spoken to by officers since the contamination was discovered when nursing staff raised the alarm.

"By . Sadie Whitelocks . Last updated at 1:09 PM on 19th January 2012 . Parents of a 15-year-old boy whose weight plummeted to just 4st 7lbs are blaming health lessons for triggering his life-threatening eating disorder. Mr and Mrs Fieldsend, claim that James's battle with anorexia started aged seven, when he was taught about healthy eating at school. Prior to the education programme he ate a balanced diet but they noticed that he got increasingly picky about food and would often skip meals. Mr and Mrs Fieldsend claim that Jame's battle with anorexia started after he was taught about healthy eating at school . And in October 2010 his family were forced to seek medical help when James's weight fell below 5st and he had a body mass index (BMI) of just 14 - anything below 18.5 is deemed . underweight. Doctors diagnosed him with anorexia and warned him if he didn't change his eating habits he would end up hospitalised. Explaining her son's gradual weight loss Mrs Fieldsend, from Hull, East . Yorkshire, said: 'He took part in an exercise in which . pupils had to talk about the food they ate at home. They were given a . star if healthy meals and a cross for junk food. 'At first we thought he was just picky and he would grow out of it, he would only eat lean ham, apples and cereal. 'If I offered him a bag of crisps he’d say they were bad for him. But we just thought it was a fad. 'He was about 11 or 12 when we thought ‘there’s something not quite right’.' James got increasingly picky about the foods he ate and would often skip meals . James, who stands at 5ft 1in, started to report various health complications as his weight dropped. Aching joints, anaemia and heart palpitations were just some of the symptoms he developed. Fearing for his life, his parents were even checked that he was still breathing throughout the night. But the teenager insisted: 'I’m just not interested in food. I don’t want to eat but I think . I look normal.' However his parents sought medical advice and James finally admitted he was suffering from an eating disorder. Doctors told him to put on 1lb in two weeks and warned him of the various health implications that could ensue if he didn't change his ways. After increasing his food intake and consulting a dietician James now weighs 5st 9lbs and has a BMI . of about 15.8. Although his health has since improved, his parents say it is an 'endless cycle' and worry his weight could drop again at anytime. James, who is studying at Hull College, has high hopes of going to university, . becoming a games designer and working in Japan. But his parents fear he may never . move from their family home, as he refuses to leave the house when he is . not at college and does not socialise with other teenagers.

"By . Sean Poulter . Last updated at 12:13 AM on 23rd January 2012 . Tesco is planning a shake-up that will see ranges and price discounts tailored to the incomes of families who live near its stores. The move is designed to breathe life into UK sales after a disastrous fall in Christmas takings. In poorer areas, where there is a threat from successful budget chains such as Aldi, Lidl and Iceland, Tesco will stock and promote more value lines, it is claimed. Target practise: Tesco is planning to adapt its product range and discounts relative to the wealth of an area . For richer or poorer: Customers in more affluent areas will be pushed to buy top-of-the-range items such the company's Finest products (left), while those in less well-off locations will have better deals on its Value lines (right) And in affluent areas stores will push the retailer’s top-of-the-range Finest lines in an attempt to stop customers deserting to the likes of Sainsbury’s, Waitrose and Marks & Spencer. Tesco already has a policy of charging more in its smaller Metro and Express stores than mainstream supermarkets. The company, Britain’s biggest retailer, also charges different prices for petrol based on location and the level of local competition. Tesco does, to some extent, tailor its ranges to the affluence and shopping habits of customers, based on information gathered through its Clubcard loyalty scheme. Second chance: The strategy is being pushed through by Tesco's UK chief executive Richard Brasher (above), who was behind the unsuccessful 'Big Price Drop' campaign . Details of the new strategy, which is said to go much further, were revealed by Tesco suppliers who have been talking to industry magazine The Grocer. The magazine said: ‘Tesco is set to launch a wave of price promotions and range reviews based on the affluence of areas.’ It said the strategy is being spearheaded by the chief executive of its UK business, Richard Brasher. Mr Brasher was also the man behind Tesco’s ‘Big Price Drop’ campaign, which has failed to deliver the boost in sales and profits the company was looking for. The move, which promised annual savings worth £500million, was part of an attempt by Tesco to be re-cast as a champion of low prices. However customers, who have continued to see the cost of their weekly shopping increase, were not won over. Rivalry: Tesco is now having to beat off fierce competition from the likes of budget chain Aldi which has experienced strong growth in recent years . Underlying sales in the crucial . Christmas trading period showed an annual fall of 2.3 per cent, bringing . warnings that profits at the supermarket chain will not grow as . expected and wiping almost £5billion off the share price. By . contrast, budget chains such as Aldi continue to grow more quickly than . any other, with new store openings and a surge in sales of around 20 . per cent a year. Pugh's take on Tesco's tailored marketing . The Grocer said: ‘Tesco has begun talks . with suppliers aimed at launching price promotions in less well-off . areas where it is facing competition from the likes of Aldi and Lidl.’ One supplier said: ‘It has a list of about 100 stores where it is going to launch special deals at discount prices. We will work with them, although we will be very concerned if they try to pass on the cost.’ At the same time another 200 stores in affluent areas have been highlighted for promotions on more upmarket ranges and products. One retail industry analyst said: ‘It’s a very clever idea and a much more strategic approach being taken by Tesco, unlike the “Big Price Drop”, which came across as very knee-jerk. ‘Richard Brasher has been saying that affluence is the new format.’ Tesco refused to comment on any upcoming strategy. A spokesman said: ‘We are not considering dual pricing. We cannot make any comment beyond that. We already have different ranges in different stores.’","Move comes after nosedive in sales over Christmas .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:26 AM on 25th January 2012 . Halle Berry was photographed heading to court today to ask a judge for an order prohibiting her ex boyfriend from having any contact with their daughter. She wanted Gabriel Aubry to be kept away from their 3-year-old while he is being investigated for child endangerment. The actress, who looked strained, was driven to the LA courthouse by her lawyer. But Halle has been told she will have to wait until Monday to get a decision. Another legal battle: Halle Berry was seen heading to court today where she is expected to ask a judge to prohibit Gabriel Aubry from seeing their daughter . Judge Scott Gordon heard the matter this morning while Judge Mark Juhas, who has been handling the ongoing custody case, is on vacation, according to TMZ. Accused: It has been claimed Gabriel Aubry was verbally and physically abusive to Nahla's nany . After . hearing the lawyers arguments, Judge Gordon decided to put the matter off until next Monday, when Judge . Juhas returns. Judge Gordon did not grant an immediate emergency . order for either side because he believed there are enough protections . in place to keep Nahla safe until Monday's hearing. Halle and Gabriel did not address the judge. The French-Canadian model is accused . of pushing the nanny of his three-year-old daughter Nahla - who he had . with ex-girlfriend Halle Berry - into a door while she was holding the . little girl. The caregiver, Alliance Kamdem, had requested a restraining order against Aubry claiming she feared retaliation. But today the judge also rejected . Kamdem's request for a restraining order, calling her petition . 'insufficient and speculative.'The judge added that Kamdem's issues should be resolved in family court. Sources have said that the alleged incident took place when Gabriel was supposed to take Nahla to school on Wednesday but kept her home instead. When . nanny Alliance Kamden arrived to pick her up and found her not to beat at school , she went to Gabriel's home and questioned him as to why he had . kept her away from school. According . to a report, Gabriel shouted: 'You're the f**king nanny. Who do you . think you are? You are a nobody. You don't need to f**king know . anything.' Legal documents: Alliance Kamden's statement in petition for a restraining order against Gabriel . Claims: The nanny has documented several incidents she claimed happened between her and Nahla's father . Not enough: The request for a restraining order was rejected but the nanny is free to pursue criminal charges . Caught in the middle: Little Nahla was seen being taking to school while her parents were in court . He then pushed her out of the door while she was carrying Nahla, and she went to the police claiming she had been injured. The investigation is being listed as 'battery' but the source adds child endangerment is also 'definitely' being investigated. Alliance has now quit as the nanny of the child, and Gabriel's representative has slammed the case. His spokesperson said: 'Anyone can file a police report at any time, regardless of it being accurate.' It is the latest development in the long-running legal battle between the pair over their daughter. The nanny has been a bone of contention previously, with the model failing in an attempt in October to have more visitation time with his daughter without her supervision. He is furious at not being allowed to care for his daughter on his own, and claims the chidlminder encroaches on his relationship with Nahla. The Mail contacted Gabriel and Halle's legal representatives, but have yet to receive a response.","Judge delays decision in custody battle until Monday .

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 6:26 PM on 23rd January 2012 . Garth Brooks has tearfully claimed how he doesn't understand receiving nothing for a $500,000 gift to a hospital in honour of his late mother. The country music star is suing Integris Canadian Valley Regional Hospital in his hometown of Yukon, Oklahoma, for allegedly going back on a promise. He claims they went back on a pledge to build a women's health centre and name it after his mother Colleen, who died of cancer in 1999. Country star: Garth Brooks is suing Integris Canadian Valley Regional Hospital in his hometown of Yukon, Oklahoma, at the Rogers County Courthouse for allegedly going back on a promise . ‘How this thing went wrong, I don't know,’ he told a court in Claremore, Oklahoma. ‘I'm the last of six kids. I was her favourite. She was my buddy. I was her biggest fan. ‘She was a pistol. All of the parties were at her house. She was just a doll. If anybody met her, (they) would have gotten to love her.’ The centre was never built - and Brooks, who said he had a ‘done deal’ with the centre and president James Moore, wants his money back plus damages. Brooks, 50, said Moore initially suggested putting his mother's name on an intensive care unit then later said they could put it on a women's centre instead. Reaction: Garth Brooks claims the hospital went back on a pledge to build a women's health centre and name it after his mother Colleen, who died of cancer in 1999 . ‘I jumped all over it,’ Brooks said. ‘It's my mom. My mom was pregnant as a teenager. She had a rough start. She wanted to help every kid out there.’ 'She was a pistol. All of the parties were at her house. She was just a doll. If anybody met her, (they) would have gotten to love her' Garth Brooks . Brooks said he gave $500,000 to the hospital anonymously, which he said was his custom when giving to charities. The singer said he, his family and the hospital wanted to keep things quiet until a ribbon-cutting ceremony to announce the centre. He was shown architectural drawings of a proposed centre bearing his mother's name. ‘That's why I thought it was a win-win for everybody,’ he said. Top-selling star: Garth Brooks, left, is pictured in 2011. His mother Colleen and father Troy are seen right in 1995 . But nothing happened and the centre was never built. His mother's name was never attached to anything at the hospital. 'My mom was pregnant as a teenager. She had a rough start. She wanted to help every kid out there' Garth Brooks . Moore told the court a women's centre was not in the hospital's plans, but Brooks said Moore never told him that before he donated the money in 2005. Three years later, he exchanged emails with Moore after he was told the money would be used to help fund new construction, Brooks said. ‘As nicely as I can, I'm trying to give him an opportunity to say why he's spending the money and there's no women's centre going up,’ he testified. Brooks said he sent his accountant to investigate what happened, but nothing came from the ongoing correspondence. Lawsuit: James Moore, left, president and CEO of Integris Canadian Valley Regional Hospital, right, arrives for the civil trial at the Rogers County Courthouse in Claremore, Oklahoma . By March 2009 he had asked the hospital to either refund his money or give it to another charity. Then he sued them in September 2009. 'I thought this was going to be mom's chance to bring a women's centre to my hometown' Garth Brooks . ‘I thought this was going to be mom's chance to bring a women's centre to my hometown,’ Brooks testified. Brooks's accountant, Cheryl Harris, testified on Friday that she wasn't aware of any conditions on his donation, which was listed as a tax deduction. Asked by Integris lawyer Terry Thomas how she believed the money would be used, she said: ‘He didn't receive anything physical.’ Brooks is the top-selling solo artist in U.S. history, with at least 128 million albums sold. His testimony is expected to resume on Monday.","Country star suing Integris Canadian Valley Regional Hospital in Oklahoma .

Lyons became angry when he learned he couldn't attend an Avril Lavigne concert . State Attorney Robert Berlin said in a statement: 'Today, Mr Lyons learned that he will spend the next 40 years of his life behind bars for the vicious murder of his mother. 'Linda Bolek did not deserve to die that day by the hands of her own son. She did not deserve to be beaten, stabbed and have chemicals poured over her as she lay helpless on the floor. 'Mr Lyons however, deserves this punishment. He has earned it and he deserves to spend what likely amounts to the rest of his life removed from society.' Lyons was known to have a history of mental illness and at the time of the murder was suffering from bipolar disorder, according to the Chicago Tribune. It was first suggested he receive 65 years in prison but DuPage County Judge Kathryn Creswell cited Lyons' record of psychiatric hospitalizations and treatments in handing down the 40-year sentence, which comes with no chance for parole. In a statement to the court on Friday, Lyons said he had not been taking his medication when he attacked his mother after another in a regular series of arguments between them. Lyons poured insecticides and chemicals over his mother's dead body . Lyons told the court he 'snapped' when he saw his mom pick up the kitchen knife and then attacked her, stabbing her nine times in the back after bashing her head in.

"By . Nick Pisa . Last updated at 9:00 PM on 24th January 2012 . The wife of 'Captain Coward' Francesco Schettino has defended her husband in an Italian magazine interview, claiming: 'He is not a monster.' Fabiola Russo spoke out as calls increased for prosecutors to widen their probe into the Costa Concordia luxury liner disaster, in which 16 people have been confirmed dead and another 16 people still are missing. In an interview with glossy Italian weekly Oggi, she said there was a witch-hunt against her husband - who is under investigation for multiple manslaughter, abandoning ship and causing a ship wreck. Witch-hunt: Fabiola Russo, wife of Costa Concordia captain Francesco . Schettino (right), claimed the media were blaming her husband for the cruise . liner disaster in an interview in Oggi magazine . Schettino is currently under house arrest following the disaster which happened earlier this month, after he recklessly steered his 114,000 ton ship, carrying more than 4,000 passengers and crew, on to rocks close to the island of Giglio in a 'sail by' salute to impress a crew member. Mrs Russo, who lives with Schettino and their 17-year-old daughter in Meta di Sorrento near Naples, said: 'My husband is not a monster. He was always the go to guy for the crew. 'I am the wife of a seaman, so I am used to doing things on my own. I tackle situations and I resolve them. 'This is a witch hunt, everyone is out to get my husband. The media has made out he is to blame. 'He loves ships, he knows all about . them and has never stopped studying them, to learn what they are capable . of and what their limits are. 'He . didn't stop at just sailing ships. That's why for his crew he was . always the go to man, a maestro. He is decisive, stable and lucid, he . analyses situations, understands them and then acts. Death trap: Sea water flows into the Costa Concordia with rope and other debris strewn around inside this corridor . Recovery: Oil workers climb in board the cruise ship as salvage crews begin preparations to pump thousands of tonnes of fuel from the vessel . Stricken: Salvage workers start pumping from a pontoon near the ship, off the coast of Giglio, Tuscany . Upturned: Chairs lay strewn across this bar area in an internal shot from the Costa Concordia . 'At times Francesco seems arrogant because he puts himself above the people he is speaking to and often tells them to shut up. 'He . wasn't in charge of the Concordia by chance, he knows how to do his job . but sometimes even those who know how to do their job can make mistakes . - that's if he did make a mistake.' Extracts from the interview were also posted on Oggi's website along with a gallery of photographs provided by Fabiola, 48, among them a series of pictures showing her husband giving a safety demonstration when he was a captain with Renaissance cruise lines in 2000. Others showed him at a desk in his cabin on another ship, or where was sat on a lifeboat of a tanker while working for American petrol giants Sunoco. Amazingly she also revealed how they had once been fined for sailing too close to the shore in their sailing boat and added: 'What we really like is canoeing and to row together you need to be in harmony and my husband and I are.' It comes as Beniamino Deidda, prosecutor general of Tuscany, the Italian region Giglio is in, called for attention in the investigation to also focus on the Concordia's owners Costa Cruises. Damage: A massive rent is visible in the hull of the cruise ship as workers climb around it . Search: Italian Navy divers prepare to go into the vessel again to look for missing passengers . Investigation: Workers climb up a rope ladder on to the cruise ship. Divers found the body of the 16th victim earlier today . He said: 'For the time being the main . focus of attention is the captain, who it has been shown was tragically . inadequate but who chose him? 'The . lifeboats did not lower properly, the crew didn't know what to do, they . were unprepared in dealing with an emergency, wrong orders were given . such as being told to return to cabins. 'The . confusion that has emerged shows that there was an incredible lack of . attention to safety procedures. Safety should have been rehearsed . beforehand. 'You cannot blame all of this carelessness on the conduct of the captain. That's why this investigation cannot exclude others.' Today . the death toll rose to 16 as the body of a woman was found on deck . three of the Concordia after a hole had once again been blown into the . side of the ship. The victim was found with a life jacket and her body was taken to a mortuary on the mainland. The chaos in the bowels of the shipwrecked Costa Concordia is the worst Fabio Paoletti, a specialist cave diver, has ever seen. The 43-year-old has pulled more than a few decomposing bodies from shipwrecked trawlers over the years, but has never had to tackle anything close to the size of the vast 17-deck Concordia. He said: 'It is always scary, every time I go down to search the wreck, the unknown is frightening. 'Making our way through the debris is difficult and tiring. Visibility ranges from 30 inches to four inches, and we have to check everything - floating tablecloths, discarded clothes - for bodies.' 'Scary': Divers working in teams spend 50 minutes at a time searching the labyrinthine corridors of the Costa Concordia for survivors and victims . Divers work together in pairs for security reasons as they search the ship at a painstakingly slow pace, often having to squeeze into confined areas where the risk of becoming trapped is great. They swim through the corridors and rooms in a zig-zag movement to make sure they cover every area. Mr Paoletti said: 'We go down for 50 minutes at a time, with three oxygen tanks strapped to us, and leave one or two along the way in case we start to run out of air. 'If we're not back in that time, our back up races to find us. 'One of the biggest risks is that you get tangled up in electrical cables snaking in the water.' The Concordia, which boasted four swimming pools, a spa, five restaurants, 13 bars, and an array of entertainment and shopping facilities, lurched on to its side when it hit rocks off the Tuscan coast on Friday, January 13. So far, 16 people have been confirmed dead. Painstaking: A diver swims through a completely submerged part of the shipwreck. Teams of searchers have to zig-zag to make sure they cover entire rooms . While the search for survivors among the 16 still missing officially continues, Mr Paoletti said he was not hopeful they could still be alive. 'If there was by a slim chance anyone down there knocking or calling out for help, we would hear it, but it's unlikely,' he said. 'Sometimes we think we've found a body, but it can just be a bundle, a jacket and a pair of glasses.' The pairs use two head lamps to scour the freezing water and navigate an obstacle course of tables and chairs, as well as items left by terrified passengers as they rushed to evacuate. The ship had 4,229 people on board from more than 60 countries when it hit rocks. The bodies, wearing life-jackets, have largely been found at emergency meeting points.","Wife described Francesco Schettino as a 'maestro' who was 'decisive, stable and lucid'

"By . Paul Revoir . Last updated at 7:02 PM on 24th January 2012 . Old favourite: Figures show more than 90 per cent of TV watched in the UK last year was viewed live . The British public's appetite for conventional TV viewing appears to have levelled out at four hours a day, new figures have revealed. The average viewing figure last year was four hours and two minutes a day via the traditional method of watching programmes, live or recorded, on a TV set. This was exactly the same as the record high figures from 2010, sparking suggestions that the steady growth in time spent watching the box has plateaued. Thinkbox predicted that traditional TV viewing levels would now 'stabilise after a sustained period of record growth' - but accept that some of us may now be getting our fix via smartphone, laptop or tablet computer. In addition, the increase in the number of adverts we are bombarded with has also slowed down. According to research published by commercial TV marketing body Thinkbox, viewers were subjected to 47 adverts a day last year, up by one per day from the previous year. The rapid increase of viewing in recent years has been fuelled by more homes getting digital TV which offers increased choice, easy to use digital video recorders such as Sky+ and popular commercial hits Downton Abbey and X Factor. But the marketing body pointed out that the figures on levels of viewing, which are taken from audience measurement body Barb, do not include the viewing of TV on lap-tops, smartphones and tablet computers, which is increasing rapidly. The organisation said data suggested that there is an additional 1.2 per cent of viewing via other devices, on top of normal TV sets. Viewing figures from Barb show that we're each watching nearly 30 hours of TV a week and BBC1 remains a favourite . The growth of satellite, cable and digital TV over the last 20 years . The figures revealed 90.6 per cent of the TV watched in the UK during 2011 was watched live and 9.4 per cent was watched on time-shifted viewing, which includes technology such as BBC iPlayer or Sky+, up from 7.6 per cent in 2010. Sources suggested that it was wrong to think that the increase in traditional TV viewing would break records every year. It was also added that the increase of 'on-demand' services built into people's main TVs, would also help consolidate TV's viewing levels. Lindsey Clay, from Thinkbox, said: 'It is obvious that people want to watch TV programmes on the best screen in the home if they can and 2012 will bring more opportunities to do that with the sale of connected TVs and more catch-up TV services to the TV set. 'And alongside that there is now a wide variety of personal screens to watch TV on which make TV even more convenient. Tablets are really delivering an excellent mobile TV experience. 'TV continues to be the most effective form of advertising.' Pioneering: On demand services such as Sky+ (pictured) and BBC iPlayer had been hailed as a revolutionary way to watch television .","Figures show 90.6 per cent of the TV watched in the UK last year was viewed when it was broadcast .

A foul-mouthed Harry  Redknapp threatened to sue a journalist as he angrily denied taking transfer ‘bungs’, a court heard yesterday. The Tottenham Hotspur boss is accused of seeking to evade tax by having £189,000 of illegal payments made into a secret bank account in Monaco, which he opened in 2002 in his pet dog’s name. Southwark Crown Court heard yesterday that Redknapp, 64, hid the existence of the account, called Rosie 47 after his dog and his year of birth, from the Inland Revenue for more than six years and from his own accountants for more than four years. A pensive-looking Harry Redknapp (left) arrives at Soutwark Crown Court . this morning with his son Jamie (right). The Spurs boss is accused of . cheating the public revenue with his former employer at Portsmouth FC . Milan Mandaric . Sheltering from the rain, Milan Mandaric also arrives at court this morning. He denies two counts of cheating the public revenue between 2002 and 2007 . REDKNAPP: ‘Don’t say bung. It’s nothing to do with a bung. It’s paid by the chairman. ‘How can it be a bung when the chairman of the football club paid me?’ He added: ‘What’s a bung? It’s a f****** sick word.’ John Black, QC, prosecuting, said the . explanation for the money paid into it had ranged from it being a bonus, . to it being an investment, a loan and a gift. When approached in 2009 by reporter Rob Beasley over the money, he . claimed it was a ‘bonus’ from Portsmouth FC chairman Milan Mandaric . during his first spell as manager at the south coast club between 2002 . and 2004. But the court heard short extracts from tape-recorded interviews with . Beasley in which Mandaric, 73, claimed the money was for investments . outside football, a ‘favour’ and ‘nothing to do with the club’. Mandaric said: ‘It was something I did for my friend ... away from football.’ Mr Beasley – who was working at the now-defunct News of the World – then . contacted Redknapp, who said of his former chairman: ‘Don’t know what . he is f****** talking about...It is a bonus.’ Redknapp told Mr Beasley the payments related to profit made on the . £4million sale of Peter Crouch from Portsmouth to Aston Villa in 2002. When asked if he had paid any tax in the UK on it, Redknapp replied: ‘Haven’t been asked to, Rob.’ In the same call, he claimed he had ‘the best accountants in England’ and said the Inland Revenue was fully aware of his dealings in tax haven . Monaco. Harry and Sandra Redknapp at a party held at the David and Victoria Beckham's house in Hertfordshire. Redknapp, who underwent minor heart surgery last year to unblock his arteries, is the most successful English manager in the modern game . When Mr Beasley suggested the payment might be considered a bung, the . jury was told Redknapp angrily replied: ‘Don’t say bung. It’s nothing to . do with a bung. ‘It’s paid by the chairman. How can it be a bung when the chairman of the football club paid me?’ He added: ‘What’s a bung? It’s a f****** sick word. I ain’t done nothing wrong ... I got paid a bonus.’ He later added: ‘Everyone knows about it, there ain’t nothing crooked in . it.’ Redknapp told Mr Beasley: ‘This money was paid by Milan in his . American account ... it was a bonus I was due. He paid the tax on it in . America. If you say the tax hasn’t been declared I will sue the b******* . off everyone at the News of the World, make no mistake.’ On the second day of Redknapp’s trial yesterday, the court heard how he . failed to declare his offshore bank account to the Inland Revenue until . 2008. Redknapp with Rosie (left), the bulldog he named the Monaco account after, and Buster close, to his Dorset home . The jury was also told Redknapp did not mention the Monaco account, or . the payment into it, to his own accountant for four and a half years. His personal banker at HSBC was left in the dark for more than five years. Redknapp has been the subject of two separate inquiries into his finances. The first of these, between January 2004 and November 2008, came in the . wake of his receipt of a £300,000 ‘gift’ after Rio Ferdinand was signed . for Leeds United from West Ham.  It was found Redknapp had paid tax on . the payment. He was then arrested by City of London police in June 2009 over the . alleged payments from Milan Mandaric. Mr Black read out extracts of his . interview at the time. The Tottenham boss was said to have told a detective: ‘I said to him . many, many times “Milan, I don’t want to end up with a tax bill”. ‘I was told I wasn’t liable for income tax on so many occasions.’ Redknapp added: ‘For the sake of that amount of money or any amount of . money, I don’t fiddle. ‘I pay my tax since I have been in football my entire life. I pay every penny.’ Redknapp told police he had nothing to do with the account and believed money was being invested by Mandaric on his behalf. He said Mandaric told him the investment had been a ‘disaster, disaster. Got wiped out. There’s still a little bit in there’ and he left it at . that. Redknapp is later said to have told police that he didn’t push the . issue but the Serbian businessman Mandaric ‘wasn’t a man to argue . with’. The court heard how Mandaric tried to convince police the payments sent to Redknapp were tax-free loans. Mandaric, now the chairman at Sheffield Wednesday, asked Redknapp to . repay about £100,000 in 2009 – weeks after   saying no comment during . questioning by detectives about the money. Mr Black said: ‘The Crown suggest this could be a transparent device by . Mr Mandaric to attempt to create an impression that the money paid by Mr . Mandaric into the Rosie 47 account had only ever been advanced by way . of a loan.’ The first charge of cheating the public purse alleges that between April . 1, 2002 and November 28, 2007 Mandaric paid £93,100 into the account. The second charge of the same offence relates to the sum of £96,300 allegedly paid between May 1, 2004 and November 28, 2007. Both deny cheating the public revenue. The trial continues.","Court hears extracts of exchange between Redknapp and NotW reporter .

More than 80 inmates at HMP Isle of Wight have been sold the birds at the discretion of prison governors for just £5 each. The prisoners, most of whom are serving life imprisonment, are given the pets after they are bred in the prison’s own aviary, based on the Albany wing. Albany wing at Isle of Wight prison where inmates are keeping birds . Lags are responsible for the care of their bird, including feeding and cleaning, and face being charged with an offence against prison discipline if they don’t. The Ministry of Justice says prison governors have the discretion to allow inmates to keep a small bird in their cell but according to the Prison Reform Trust, not many prisons allow it. The MOJ says allowing prisoners to have birds in their cells 'engenders a sense of responsibility as well as providing an interest, particularly for those serving long sentences'. A Freedom of Information request revealed 81 prisoners have pet birds at Isle of Wight - of these 63 have one bird and 18 have two. The type of bird is not always recorded but it appears there are currently 97 budgies, one canary and one parrot.

'A prisoner who fails to care for a bird properly would be liable to be charged with an offence and the bird would also be removed and re-homed with another prisoner.' Glyn Travis, spokesman for Professional Trades Union for Prison, Correctional and Secure Psychiatric Workers, said: 'Looking after birds gives prisoners something to focus on. 'There are some people that feel prisoners shouldn’t have any comforts, but we try and give them access to a reasonable lifestyle.

Russia’s elections commission said Tuesday that a prominent opposition leader will be disqualified from running for president in March, a move that would prevent his party from fielding observers. Russian news agencies quoted elections commission secretary Nikolai Konkin as saying that the body would formally block Grigory Yavlinsky from the ballot later this week, after finding that hundreds of thousands of the signatures submitted on his nominating petition were invalid. Yavlinsky the leader of Russia’s leading liberal party said Monday that election officials’ refusal to clear his candidacy for March’s presidential election reflects the government’s fear of genuine competition. Keeping a tight grip: One of Vladimir Putin's possible competitors will be disqualified for running for president in March . He said authorities want to prevent him from challenging Prime Minister Vladimir Putin’s bid to extend his 12-year rule by reclaiming the presidency. Adding that the Prime Minister's other contenders are only nominal rivals who are following the Kremlin’s guidance. Yavlinsky is a leader of the liberal Yabloko party and a critic of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who is seeking a return to the presidency in the March 4 election. Kicking the competition into shape: Putin is seeking a return to the presidency in the March 4 election . Foot to the floor: Putin is seen as all but certain to win the election while Yavlinsky was unlikely to attract any significant voter support .

Opposition: Grigory Yavlinksy's party fielded thousands of election observers in the December election who documented evidence of fraud in favor of Putin's United Russia party . But the rejection of his candidacy is likely to sharpen political tensions that have been brewing since last month’s unprecedented massive protests sparked by alleged fraud in parliamentary elections. Although Yavlinsky has not been a key . figure of those protests, his party fielded thousands of election . observers in the December election who documented evidence of fraud in . favor of Putin’s United Russia party. Political analyst Mikhail Rezimov told the state news agency RIA Novosti: 'Yavlinsky . does not have so many supporters, but the negative effect of this . decision will be much wider than the dissatisfaction of Yavlinsky . supporters and will give reason to speak, including in the West, of a . managed election.' Head of . Yabloko, Sergei Mitrokhin, said in a statement: 'We insist that all the . signatures submitted to the Central Elections Commission in support of . Yavlinsky’s nomination are real, the real signatures of citizens.' Yabloko . has not had any seats in the parliament since 2007. Politicians who . want to run for president but whose parties are not in parliament must . submit 2 million signatures in support of their candidacy. Konkin . said that examinations of about 600,000 of the signatures submitted to . support Yavlinsky’s nomination found some 25 per cent of them to be . invalid, largely because the signatures were photocopied. That is higher than the five per cent rejection level allowed by law.","Elections commissioner says hundreds of thousands of Grigory Yavlinksy's nomination signatures are invalid .

Severe weather warnings have been issued for many areas with up to four inches of snow expected to fall on higher ground in Scotland and northern England. One of the first places to be hit was County Durham in the north-east, with residents waking to find heavy snowfall and ice. Bleak: A walker struggles through the snowy landscape of rural Northumberland. Forecasters had warned of a 24-hour cold snap with snow in Scotland and northern England . Extreme: A motorist edges forward cautiously through Otterburn Ranges, Northumberland . Wintry: Residents in parts of the north east woke up to snow this morning. This snowy scene was in Tow Law, County Durham . Having fun: This woman in Tow Law clearly enjoyed the snowfall. She may be disappointed by predictions that the snow is a 'short-lived event' With temperatures yesterday hovering only just above freezing for many parts of the country, . including London, forecasters warned that ice could create hazardous . driving conditions. Dan . Williams, from . the Met Office, said it would be a 'short-lived event'. Milder . temperatures of about 10C are expected to return but with heavy rain . likely in some areas. Britain has basked in unusually balmy . temperatures over the last week with the country on course for one of . the mildest winters since records began 350 years ago. But forecasters warned that in the coming weeks the unseasonably warm weather may not last, with easterly . winds causing snowstorms and freezing temperatures to rip through the . country again. Mr Williams said: 'If we continue to get winds coming off the . Atlantic from a westerly direction, these will bring mild air over the . UK. 'But if the wind changes to an easterly flow, it has the potential to bring cold air from continental Europe. 'This is what happened in December 2010, . which was very cold because we had an easterly flow for almost a month. 'When that happens, any precipitation becomes snow and we had lots of . snow and freezing weather.' The average temperature from December . 1 to January 15 has been 5.5C, where the warmest winter . in history, in 1868-69, topped that at 6.8C. At the weekend, families . played in parks and took walks in the countryside as the mercury soared . to a summery 13.5C peak in Otterbourne, Hampshire. Snowdrops have been in bloom since January 4, earlier than the country has seen in five years. Improvement: This three-day forecast shows how the weather will improve as the week progresses . Hazardous: Severe weather warnings have been issued for many areas today with up to four inches of snow expected to fall on higher ground in Scotland and northern England . Gloomy outlook: Forecasters warned that easterly winds could cause snowstorms and freezing temperatures to rip through the country . Tricky conditions: Motorists in the north east were slowed down due to the wintry weather . Forecasters say rain that moved across the east of the UK yesterday is likely to turn to sleet and snow across northern and eastern areas. This could result in 1-2inches of snow on land above 200-300 metres with as much as 4ins on land above 400 metres. There could also be a more slushy form of snow down to about 100 metres. The Met Office says icy patches may also be expected where rain falls on sub-zero surfaces. Transport routes could be disrupted, particularly on higher ground. Sleet or wet snow is also expected to fall on other parts of eastern England later this morning, however, it is unlikely to settle. Today it is expected to be mild, wet and windy. As the day progresses, it will get colder and brighter with more showers. Snow is again predicted for higher ground on Thursday. The good news is that the showers and winds will ease by Friday. Daffodils have also been blossoming early, with the buds of silver birch, oak and hazel trees bursting into flower. Britain will this week enjoy . temperatures of around 9-11C - even warmer than Istanbul in Turkey, . where it will be 7-10C, and Madrid in Spain, where temperatures will . hover between 5C and 11C. If . the cosy conditions persist for another few weeks, the nation could be . enjoying the mildest weather since the first Punch and Judy show was . performed in this country in 1662. Blizzards hit the U.S. this weekend, after it too had experienced one of its mildest winters up until now. Fast-moving snowstorms spread from Pennsylvania to Connecticut in the north-east while four climbers went missing in the Pacific north-west after rare heavy snowfall. Snowfall was expected to reach three to five inches (8-13 cm) in New York City, and up to three inches in Boston. The capital, Washington, got a mixture of snow and ice overnight and Philadelphia International Airport cancelled 66 flights. Forecasters said we will know by the end of the week whether Britain is going to be next, and the start of February could set the tone for the rest of the winter. Mr Williams added: 'Either we will continue to get mild temperatures or it will get much colder, with wind bringing widespread frost and snow in some areas.' The temperature in December was 0.6C above average, with westerly winds bringing in warm air as well as the storms that battered the UK. Dangerous: Drivers had to be extremely cautious in County Durham . Snowy states: Blizzards lashed the U.S. Pictured, Richard Foster walks through La Porte, California, wearing shorts . Skiing trip: A woman finds an unusual method of dealing with the morning snow along the Brooklyn Heights Promenade in New York City . Families will be hoping the warm weather will last into spring, after last April was one of the hottest and driest on record, at an average of around 11.9C (53F). The Woodland Trust said the past three months of 2011 only saw four air frosts in their central England temperature series, compared to 35 in 2010, and an average of 15 between 1878-2010. Spokeswoman Dr Kate Lewthwaite said: 'Our native plants and trees are great indicators of wider changes in the natural world. By recording budburst and flowers blooming, the public can help us determine whether these changes are having a major effect on how Mother Nature functions. 'In recent years it has become more commonplace to see daffodils and snowdrops in late December and early January as the climate warms.' The Trust is also keeping an eye out for evidence of frogspawn  to see whether frogs are being fooled into spawning early, as if this was followed by freezing weather it could lead to frozen spawn in ponds up and down the country.","Severe weather warnings issued for many parts of UK .

Elderly people with dementia are at greater risk of suffering a fall if they are given anti-depressants in care homes, say experts. It is known that the medication can cause a range of side effects including dizziness and blurred vision, but a move to newer drugs, known as known as selective serotonin uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), was hoped to reduce these symptoms. However research has found care home residents taking this type of medication were three times more likely to suffer an  injury-causing fall than those . not taking SSRIs. A study has found elderly people with dementia are at greater risk of suffering a fall if they are given anti-depressants in care homes . Falls are the leading cause of accidental death in the over-65s and the Alzheimer's society is now calling for further research to investigate alternative psychiatric treatments. Professor Clive Ballard, director of research at the Alzheimer's Society said: 'Two thirds of care home residents have dementia so it is worrying that a common antidepressant, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), is causing increased risk to people with the condition. 'More research is now needed to understand why this antidepressant is having this effect on people with dementia and if there is an alternative treatment for depression that they could be prescribed.' Researchers from the Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam, recorded the daily drug use and records of falls in 248 nursing home residents over a two-year period. The average age of the residents was 82, and the records suggested that 152 of them had suffered a total of 683 falls resulting in hip fractures, sprains, bruises, swelling and in one case death. SSRIs were shown to treble the risk of having an . injury-causing fall and this increased if . the patient was simultaneously prescribed sedative drugs, such as sleeping pills. The findings, published in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology,  suggest this trend occurs regardless of sex and age. Lead researcher Dr Carolyn Sterke said that the findings could help develop more effective fall prevention strategies. She warned: 'Physicians should be cautious in prescribing SSRIs to older people with dementia, even at low doses.' While the study uncovered an association between injury-causing falls and SSRI use, a direct cause and effect relationship has not been proven. It is estimated that 750,000 people in the UK have a form of dementia, more than half have Alzheimer's disease.","Residents taking SSRIs three times more likely to suffer an  injury-causing fall .

Tesco today found itself under siege from both sweet-toothed shoppers and horrified anti-obesity experts after slashing the price of chocolate bars to 20p. In a move to win back customers following a Christmas slump, the supermarket chain has slashed the price of . five-packs of Snickers, KitKat Chunky, Twix, Mars and Bounty to just . £1. The deal means each bar costs just 20p - while bars sold individually in the shop can cost up to 54p. One Tesco shopper struggles under the weight of bags of discounted chocolate . Shoppers have been seen leaving Tesco stores across the country with armfuls of the chocolate. However, health experts have criticised the move as promoting poor eating habits. ‘To have this kind of promotion at this time when obesity is such as . problem is frankly totally irresponsible,’ said National Obesity Forum . spokesman Tam Fry. But consumers seemed more concerned with snapping up a bargain. One woman was spotted leaving a Tesco Extra in Southampton, Hants, with . ten packs of Mars, which are normally on sale for 1.89 per pack. Helen Taylor, 42, said: 'My family and I are chocoholics so when I . spotted this deal I couldn't resist. These will keep us going for the . next few months. 'I saved nearly nine pounds on all of this.' The deal, which lasts until . the end of January, could be a spirited attempt to turn around a Christmas slump when takings fell by as much as 2.3 per cent. Share prices plummeted and nearly £5billion pounds wiped of the value of the company as a result. Financial expert Jasmine Birtles, who runs website moneymagpie.com, added: 'Potentially, this deal is a good thing. 'In this day and age thrift is the new bling - and this country is going . to be bargain crazy for the next two years as we recover. 'Bargains are the way to go but Tesco can't make it a one off. 'They should do deals like this regularly and the deals have to be real . to keep customers' trust.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:00 PM on 22nd January 2012 . Matthew Scheidt, 18, was arrested for posing as a cop . A serial imposter, who once posed as a nurse to perform CPR on a man having an heart attack, has been arrested again - this time for impersonating a police officer. Matthew Scheidt, 18, was charged with carrying a concealed firearm and posing as an officer after telling an undercover cop to 'buckle up' in Miami Beach. At the time of his arrest, the teen is alleged to have had several police items including an Osceola County sheriff's badge, deputies' T-shirts, a handgun, stun gun, handcuffs, a police radio and an ankle holster, according to records. He also had a laptop computer mounted on . his car dashboard as well as 'takedown lights' used by officers in . unmarked cars, reports the Orlando Sentinel. The undercover detective claims he had asked Scheidt if he was a police officer after the teenager told him to put on his seat belt. Scheidt allegedly said he was twice and the undercover detective informed him that someone had offered to sell him drugs, Scheidt promised to follow the tip up, according to the records. Stash: This evidence photo released by the police show all the police equipment that was seized from Scheidt at the time of his arrest . At the time of his arrest, Scheidt of Orlando was found to be carrying the pictured false hospital IDs . The Miami Beach officer became suspicious as he did not recognize Scheidt and called for back-up, reports the Sentinel. The teen - who previously is accused of conning Kissimmee hospital workers into letting him treat a patient in cardiac arrest - has a history of impersonating medical staff and police dating back to when he was just 13. In August, Scheidt, then 17, allegedly persuaded Osceola Regional Medical Center employees to issue him a badge for a physician assistant and used it to work in the hospital's emergency room for several days, records allege. At the time, Scheidt worked for a doctors' office in Kissimmee and had been issued a valid ID for limited areas of the hospital. St. Cloud Regional Medical Center also caught him pretending to be a nurse in 2007, just before he turned 14, records show. The Osceola County Sheriff's Office is also charging the teen with grand theft after it emerged the police radio he is accused of having belonged to the force. Matthew Scheidt was carrying this police this badge with him when he was arrested in Miami Beach on Wednesday . The 18-year-old also had this T-shirt with him when he was arrested in Miami Beach among other police equipment . Sheriff's spokeswoman Twis Lizasuain told the Sentinel that the badge Scheidt was carrying also looked like an agency badge but was not. All of the items seized from the teen will be examined to determine whether they were stolen from the police. Scheidt is already awaiting trial in Osceola on two counts of impersonating a physician assistant and four counts of practicing medicine without a license. His next court appearance in the Kissimmee case is March 6, according to the Orange-Osceola State Attorney's Office. Despite his being 17 at the time, prosecutors chose to indict him as an adult because of the severity of his accused acts., reports the Sentinel.","Matthew Scheidt was arrested after telling an undercover officer to 'buckle up'

Last updated at 8:26 AM on 13th December 2011 . The former girlfriend of a gunman shot dead by police after he went on a shooting rampage along a Hollywood street has described how she woke to 14 text messages informing her of his death. Alicia Alligood, 24, had broken up with her boyfriend of four-and-a-half years Tyler Brehm, 26, just days before he went on the spree that left one man in critical condition and two injured. But she was unaware of his involvement in the shooting until she woke at 7 a.m. the following day to 14 text messages - some from the shooter himself. Scroll down to see video . Happier times: Tyler Brehm and ex-girlfriend Alicia Alligood are believed to have broken up four days before he went on a shooting rampage through Hollywood. The couple had been together for more than four years . Brehm, who neighbours said struggled to get over the December 1 breakup, sent messages minutes before he stood on the Hollywood intersection and shot at passing vehicles. He had also left Alligood a voicemail hours earlier, telling her he loved her. But Alligood described her former boyfriend . as a 'humanitarian', and someone who was 'extremely motivated to change . the world for the better', even managing a non-profit organisation for a . friend. Speaking to KTLA, she added he had been 'really stressed out lately'. He had met a woman he thought was a . pharmaceutical saleswoman who had given him some kind of pills, Alligood . said. He began taking the pills, which Alligood found alarming as he had never taken 'hard' drugs before. Down: Police shot the gunman dead after he injured three motorists and refused to drop his weapon . Drama: The gunman stands in the middle of the road as he prepares to shoot the driver of the passing pickup . After the breakup, he had moved to his own apartment half a mile from the scene of the shooting, she said. Neighbours said Brehm had been . struggling to overcome the separation. ‘He wasn't a bad guy, he just got fed up,’ friend Christina Mesropian told KNBC. ‘He was like “Ah, I'm over it, I'm over it,” but I could tell he wasn't over it.’ Ramon Hernandez, who lived in the . apartment next door to Brehm, said the couple had recently moved out. He . told KABC-TV he had heard them arguing. Together: The couple had lived together until early December. Alicia Alligood said her former boyfriend had uncharacteristically started taking pills and was 'really stressed out' ‘I could tell that he was an unstable person,’ Hernandez said, ‘but I don't know the details on what actually made him snap.’ Police have not yet announced a motive for the crime, but Alligood said she believed the breakup was the trigger. Brehm, who was Hispanic and dressed in . a white sweat vest, walked down the middle of Sunset Boulevard on Friday, firing . on motorists and in the air until he was shot and killed. Passers-by initially thought he was an actor from a movie being filmed nearby – until he was . shot dead by a policeman. Brehm . wounded three people – one critically – before he was killed by an . off-duty officer working as a security guard on the neighbouring film, . believed to be a gangster thriller starring Sean Penn. He was filmed from an office block as he stood in the middle of the road firing on pedestrians and motorists. Victim: John Atterberry remains in critical condition after being shot through the jaw and neck as he drove to the bank. The top music executive has worked with The Spice Girls, Brandy and Jessica Simpson . Shot: Atterberry, who now works as a film producer according to friends, is seen being taken to hospital . In the video, he can be seen pacing . back and forth near the busy intersection with Vine Street, firing close . to 20 rounds from what appeared to be a .40 caliber handgun. One victim has been named as John Atterberry, a . former music industry executive who has worked with artists like Brandy, The . Spice Girls and Jessica Simpson. The 40-year-old driver of a . Mercedes-Benz, who now works as a film producer, was shot in the jaw and . upper torso on a routine trip to the bank. He was taken to hospital and remains in critical . condition. Witness Micah Williams said he . thought the suspect was part of a movie. ‘Then the third bullet . ricocheted right by our head and I was like, “Dude, they’re shooting at . us,” ’ he said. Questionable interests: In his Twitter profile picture, Tyler Brehm clearly displays a bong in the background . Speaking his mind: Brehm Tweeted at actor Charlie Sheen just days before the shooting . Another bystander, Gregory Bojorquez, . said: ‘At first it seemed like a movie but then I heard the sound of the . bullets hitting metal. It was bizarre, like something from a cop show. You get so used to seeing filming in LA that lots of people were . watching it thinking it was for a film.’ It is thought the gunman ran out of bullets and had pulled a knife from his belt when he was shot by the policeman. ‘He was screaming he was going to die and that he wanted to die,’ Bojorquez, a photographer who captured images of the shooting's aftermath, told the Los Angeles Times. 'He was just kind of shooting spontaneously,' witness William Wiles told The Baltimore Sun Times, recalling what he saw as he watched incident from his bedroom window. At ease: Tyler Brehm appears relaxed in a photograph with his mother Melissa . 'He didn't really have any mission or purpose or anyone in particular,' Mr Wiles continued. One man suffered a grazing wound to his left thigh when a bullet passed through his car door. Another man had minor cuts from broken glass after bullet struck the driver door where it met the window. Another witness, Chris Johns, said: . 'This was like a serious mad man. He snapped and he's going to try to . kill as many people as possible,' Mr Johns said. He continued shooting at vehicles and in the air when he was confronted by the officers. They . ordered the suspect to drop his weapon. He was shot when he pointed his . weapon at the officers. The gunman was pronounced dead at the scene. Dead: Brehm's body is covered with a blanket after the confrontation where he screamed: 'I want to die' Blasted: The gunman fires into a vehicle before producing a knife after running out of bullets . A truck and another car were struck by bullets, and two people were treated at the scene for minor injuries. Sean Penn and Ryan Gosling's crime drama, Gangster Squad, is being filmed nearby. It is unknown if the actors were on set during the real-life shooting, but they would have heard the gunfire. In . the Los Angeles area, every movie production is required to have a . permit, so if there is shooting,  for a movie, locals are notified for . any loud noises and big signs are placed on street corners.

"By . Sadie Whitelocks . Last updated at 5:04 PM on 18th January 2012 . A toddler debilitated by an abnormal growth that weighed more than the rest of his body, is able to run free for the first time following its removal. Riley Campbell, now aged 16 months, suffered from a rare lymphatic  malformation on his back which caused him to fall over when he attempted to walk. His parents couldn't let him out of their sight in case the 4.5lb mass, which had its own blood supply, ruptured and he bled to death. Yvonne and Jordan Campbell with their son Riley, who can now run free after having a giant growth removed . But now, thanks to a ten-hour operation, Riley is able to run around with his siblings Declan, 17, Lauren, 15 and four-year-old Leona. The giant growth when it was removed, weighed 4.5lbs meaning premature Riley was just 3lbs when he was born. Mother Yvonne, 35, said: 'It was horrific what we went through but Riley’s made of strong stuff. 'He’s just like other children his age now. He’s into everything. It’s amazing.' The growth was spotted when Yvonne and husband Jordan, from Irvine, North Ayrshire, went for a 32-week scan. At first, it was not known whether the growth was attached to Yvonne or her unborn baby. The growth was spotted when Yvonne and husband Jordan went for a scan . Mother Yvonne said: 'He'll be scarred for life but it's a small price to pay. I call it his shark bite because it looks like one.' But a more detailed scan revealed that the growth was in fact attached to Riley, and his parents feared the worse. They were given another blow when it was . discovered it had it’s own blood supply and Riley had rapidly been . losing blood while in the womb. It was also suspected that the growth could be . on his brain. However specialists were unable to tell . because of the baby’s position so an MRI scan was scheduled for a week . later. But the scan was never conducted as Yvonne suddenly went into labour. She . had an emergency caesarean section because the growth could have caused . the baby to get stuck, cutting off the oxygen supply. Riley was born five weeks premature and weighed seven and a half pounds including the weight of his growth. Yvonne said: 'They brought him to show me before he was whisked away. 'I’d tried to prepare myself but I didn’t know what to expect. It was massive.' Riley was immediately transferred to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow. There, he was diagnosed with a . lymphatic malformation, which results from an abnormal development of . the lymphatic vessels that drain fluid from tissues. When these vessels develop abnormally . they can cause a localised swelling, often with cysts, and sometimes . blood vessels can also develop abnormally in the same area. Standing tall: Riley can now walk now he no longer has the weight of the malformation on his back . Doctors said it was too dangerous to . remove the growth because it was so close to his liver and lungs and he . was too small for such a major operation. Riley was kept in intensive care and doctors monitored him around the clock in case the growth ruptured and he bled to death. After two weeks in hospital, . doctors finally allowed Riley’s parents to take him home. Yvonne said: 'It was such a relief but we were so scared. We had to be so careful. 'We were taught how to resuscitate him and were told to take him straight to hospital if he became pale or listless. 'As he got older, I wouldn’t let him out my sight in case he knocked it and it bled like it did in the womb. 'When he learnt to walk, he kept falling over because of the weight of it.' Just after Riley’s first birthday, in . October last year, doctors decided it was safe to operate after a scan . showed the growth had moved. Surgeons discovered it had spread . to his ribs and muscles. The intricate operation took ten hours as if any of the growth had been left, it could have grown back. Riley was given a blood transfusion and needed skin grafts because the scar was so large. After the operation, he was moved to intensive care and put on a ventilator to allow his body to recover and finally, a month later, he was allowed to go home. Father Jordan, sister Leona, four, mother Yvonne and Riley following his operation . Yvonne said: 'He’ll be scarred for life but it’s a small price to pay. I call it his shark bite because it looks like one. 'I’ve got a scrap book with photos of him in hospital to show him what he came through. 'I don’t want him to be self conscious of his scar. I want him to be proud of it.' Medics at Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow, revealed that Riley's case was unusual, because of the positioning of the growth, and as a result the operation took longer than the standard procedure. A spokesperson said: 'We’re very pleased with how Riley has recovered from his surgery although we’ll need to keep a check on him as he grows older to ensure that he doesn’t develop difficulties related to his scar.'","Riley Campbell born with rare lymphatic  malformation .

Anderson Cooper, the CNN anchor and talk show host, has shelled out $1.7million for his third upscale home in New York -- and he doesn't even plan to live in this one. Mr Cooper bought the house next door to his own estate in Quogue, near the Hamptons on Long Island, so that no one would tear it down to replace it with a 'McMansion,' according to reports. The home, with four bedrooms on 2.4 acres along Aspatuck Creek, once belonged to Oscar-winning screenwriter Budd Schulberg who wrote On The Waterfront. The house was once priced at $3.5million, but was most recently listed on the market for $2.25million. Mr Cooper's new purchase is blessed with 3,654 square feet, two fireplaces, a billiard room and a slate patio. A garage with an office as well as a pool and a pool house are also located on the wooded property. Mr . Cooper paid $1.7million for the 1946 home because he did not want to . see new neighbors move in only to tear it down, the New York Post . reported. This is not the first big purchase for . the globe-trotting newsman. In September 2009, he paid $4.3million for . an old firehouse in New York City's West Village.

When Laura Fitzwalter’s brother noticed one of her shoulder blades was more pronounced than the other, her parents were concerned but not worried. After all, the then 13-year-old seemed  to be in perfect health and had never complained of any pain. But the schoolgirl and her family were left stunned after an X-ray revealed that she was suffering from one of the worst cases of curvature of the spine  – scoliosis  – doctors had ever seen. They warned that if she did not have an . operation – which could leave her  paralysed – her lungs and heart would . slowly be crushed. Laura Fitzwalter (left) had the biggest curve in her spine doctors had ever seen. She has grown four inches since the operation . Laura’s mother Tracy, a pre-school assistant, said: ‘We were shocked when we saw how curved Laura’s spine was. 'The surgeon said it was the biggest curve he had ever seen. It was devastating to hear it would have killed her as it was crushing her heart and lungs.' 'The operation risked paralysing her, but we had no choice. She had to have the operation to survive.’ Laura, now 16, has made a full recovery and is an astonishing 4in taller than before the operation. Her brother Adam, 19, first noticed there was a problem with her back during a family holiday in April 2008. Mrs Fitzwalter, who lives with husband Neil, a sales director, in Bournemouth, said: ‘Adam noticed that Laura’s shoulder blade seemed to be sticking out more on the right side. ‘We had never noticed it before, but  it was really quite pronounced and noticeable when she was wearing a strappy summer top. She wasn’t in any pain, but I was concerned about it.’ After returning home, a doctor diagnosed her with scoliosis, a curvature of the spine. The condition affects up to four in every 1,000 children in the UK and can develop at  any time in childhood or adolescence. Most cases correct themselves naturally, but occasionally surgery is needed. A surgeon at Poole General Hospital, where Laura’s X-rays were taken, later told the family it was the biggest curvature he had seen. Mrs Fitzwalter said: ‘When we heard the news, we were absolutely devastated. At the time, Laura wasn’t in any pain and yet we were being told that her life was in danger. ‘If her spine was left to carry on curving, then it would kill her. Laura was terrified. ‘It was awful to hear what the risks were. The surgeon told us it was the equivalent to open heart surgery and that she could end up paralysed. ‘But we didn’t have a choice. She had to have the operation to survive.’ The schoolgirl underwent  surgery in July 2010 at Southampton General Hospital, where it took ten hours to fix metal rods on either side of her spine to straighten it. Laura, with mother Tracy and father Neil. She has now fully recovered from her operation and is back riding her horse Sparky again . Mrs Fitzwalter said: ‘Waiting for the operation to finish  was the longest ten hours of our life. 'She had been so frightened when she was wheeled down for surgery. But she was so brave. We couldn’t believe it when she came home taller than she had been before. ‘She . had to buy a whole new wardrobe of clothes because nothing fitted her . any more. But it has given her so much more confidence. ‘She . loves riding her horse Sparky again, she sits much straighter in the . saddle. It’s amazing to see how well Laura is doing. It was a risky . operation, but it’s all been worth it.’ Laura will have to have a yearly check up, but is not expected to need more surgery. A . spokesman for the Scoliosis SOS clinic, which specialises in treating . the condition, said: ‘We have never heard of a case of anyone who has a . spine with a bigger curve than this. She has been very lucky.’",Laura's brother first noticed there was a problem with her back during a family holiday in April 2008 .
"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 9:05 AM on 25th January 2012 . An Oklahoma hospital in Garth Brooks' hometown must pay $1million to the country singer because it failed to build a women's health centre in honour of his late mother, jurors ruled Tuesday evening. Jurors ruled that the hospital must return a $500,000 donation to Brooks plus pay him $500,000 in punitive damages in Brooks' breach-of-contract lawsuit against Integris Canadian Valley Regional Hospital in Yukon. Brooks said he thought he'd reached a deal in 2005 with the hospital's president, James Moore, but sued after learning the hospital wanted to use the money for other construction projects. Country singer: Jurors ruled that the hospital must return a $500,000 donation to Garth Brooks plus pay him $500,000 in punitive damages . The hospital argued that Brooks gave . it unrestricted access to the $500,000 donation and only later asked . that it build a women's centre and name it after his mother, Colleen . Brooks, who died of cancer in 1999. 'Obviously we are disappointed, . particularly with the jury's decision to award damages above and beyond . the $500,000,' Integris spokesman Hardy Watkins said. 'We're just glad . to see the case come to a resolution.' Brooks called the jurors 'heroes' and said he felt vindicated by their verdict. 'I no longer feel like I'm crazy,' he said. Jury member Beverly Lacy said she . voted in favor of Brooks because she thought the hospital went back on . its word. As far as the punitive damages, she said: 'We wanted to show . them not to do that anymore to anyone else.' Relieved: Brooks called the jurors 'heroes' and said he felt vindicated by their verdict . Top-selling star: Garth Brooks, left, is pictured in 2011. His mother Colleen and father Troy are seen right in 1995 . During the trial, Brooks testified . that he thought he had a solid agreement with Moore. Brooks said the . hospital president initially suggested putting his mother's name on an . intensive care unit, and when Brooks said that wouldn't fit her image, . Moore suggested a women's centre. 'I jumped all over it,' Brooks told . jurors in tearful testimony. 'It's my mom. My mom was pregnant as a . teenager. She had a rough start. She wanted to help every kid out . there.' His attorney told the jury during closing arguments that Brooks kept his end of the agreement. 'This case is about promises: promises . made and promises broken,"" lawyer John Hickey told jurors shortly . before they started deliberating. 'Mr Brooks kept his promise. Integris . never intended to keep their promise and never built a new women's centre.' But hospital attorney Terry Thomas . said Brooks' gift initially came in anonymously and unrestricted in . 2005. He also noted that Brooks couldn't remember key details of . negotiations with the hospital's president - including what he'd been . promised - when questioned during a deposition after filing his lawsuit . in 2009. Lawsuit: James Moore, left, president and CEO of Integris Canadian Valley Regional Hospital, right, arrives for the civil trial at the Rogers County Courthouse in Claremore, Oklahoma . 'At most, it was a misunderstanding . between these two,' Thomas told jurors during his closing argument. 'Am I . calling Mr. Brooks a liar? Absolutely not. It's perfectly . understandable that he does not remember these events.' The jury began deliberating Tuesday . afternoon in Rogers County District Court, and the judge told jurors she . wanted them to work as late as midnight to come to a decision. Before the verdict was read, Brooks . said the day had been emotional. The country music star said he was . simply trying to honour his mother. 'This little pistol, she deserves nothing but good,' Brooks said. ‘I jumped . all over it,’ Brooks said. ‘It's my mom. My mom was pregnant as a . teenager. She had a rough start. She wanted to help every kid out . there.’ Brooks said he gave $500,000 to the hospital anonymously, which he said was his custom when giving to charities. The . singer said he, his family and the hospital wanted to keep things quiet . until a ribbon-cutting ceremony to announce the centre. He . was shown architectural drawings of a proposed centre bearing his . mother's name. ‘That's why I thought it was a win-win for everybody,’ he . said.","Country star sued Integris Canadian Valley Regional Hospital in Oklahoma for breach-of-contract .

"By . Anthony Bond . Last updated at 9:52 AM on 25th January 2012 . They may not have to deal with traffic wardens, parking tickets or speed cameras. But it seems that birds, like drivers, do have to stick to a speed limit. According to researchers in the U.S., birds must fly below a certain speed to avoid crashing into trees and other obstacles. If they go over the limit, it becomes more difficult to spot objects they could hit. And with the absence of any helpful road signs on their routes, they have to work out their safe maximum speed themselves – taking into account factors including their size and manoeuvrability, as well as how built-up the area they are flying through is. Way forward: Scientists have discovered that birds intuitively know how fast to fly - and hope to use this research to improve unmanned robots travelling through built-up areas . The researchers, from the Massachusetts . Institute of Technology, believe their findings could help defence . experts programme unmanned drones to fly as fast as possible without . crashing. They looked at birds such as the daredevil northern goshawk and . developed mathematical models based on the way the animals travel . through the air. Study author Professor Emilio Frazzoli said: ‘If birds flew at speeds . purely based on what they can immediately see, they wouldn’t go very . fast.’ Instead, he explained, they roughly calculate the density of the . environment they are flying through and set themselves a top speed based . on the likelihood of finding a gap between the trees or buildings. Above that top speed, he went on, they are ‘sure to crash’. But if they . stay below it, they could theoretically remain in flight forever. Professor Frazzoli, who is currently testing his theory on pigeons, . added: ‘There is no magic number for the critical speed. In fact, the . critical speed depends on some parameters describing tree density and . size, and the bird’s manoeuvrability and size. ‘In other words, if the forest is too dense, the trees are too thick, . the bird is too large or flying too fast, it will eventually collide . with a tree.’ He said that ‘mathematical calculations’ drawn from the way birds fly . could eventually be used by scientists to increase the speed unmanned . drones can safely fly at.",New research could help U.S military who currently use drones in Afghanistan .
"By . Lauren Paxman . Last updated at 5:18 PM on 20th January 2012 . A father who was so fat he used to drive his car almost horizontal so he could fit behind the wheel has lost nearly half his body weight. Marc Soulsby, who weighed more than 41 stone, used to gorge on pork pie sandwiches every night as well as packets of biscuits and takeaways. But when he eventually broke the seat of his car, his sisters confronted Marc and persuaded him to stop eating himself to death. Marc, who used to stuff himself with pork pie sandwiches has has lost 16 stone (and hopes to lose a few more) Before going on a diet, the 39-year-old was too ashamed to leave the house and couldn't walk anywhere without becoming breathless. Now - after shedding 16 stone, the weight of a baby elephant - Marc, from Gateshead says he no longer recognises himself. He said: 'If you had seen me two years ago to what I am now, you would think I was two different people. 'I used to drive almost lying down just so my belly could fit behind the wheel. Nobody could fit behind me either. 'The day the seat broke was pretty bad, although I can laugh about it now.' Mark, who is dad to 15-year-old Connor, admits he 'has always been big' but says that his weight spiralled after he lost his job as a call centre trainer in 2005. With nothing to do, Mark would sleep from 6am until 2pm, skip breakfast and lunch before devouring a takeaway at around 9pm with half a loaf of bread on the side. He said: 'I was really lazy. My mam would try and give me recipes but I just couldn't be bothered with it. It was so much easier to phone up for a takeaway.' As Marc began to pile on the pounds he became reclusive, too scared to even go into his garden after a group of boys taunted him about his size. Very happy family: Marc pictured with hi sisters Donna (left) and Lisa who persuaded him to loose weight . He said: 'It was like a spiral, your . confidence is knocked, you're not going out as much and you just find . yourself comfort eating. 'Anytime my friends would call or ask me to go out, I'd say I was busy and make excuses. 'I used to have a lot of friends but I cut them out because of the way I felt about myself.' The only time Marc would venture outside was to drive his grandmother - who has asthma and a knee replacement - to the shops or to pick up his 15-year-old son Connor from school. He said: 'Crowds used to really scare me. And when I picked my son up he used to ask me to stay in the car. 'It could have just been that age where it is not cool for your dad to come for you, but then I always thought he might be embarrassed about my weight too.' One day his sister Lisa persuaded him to go for a walk, but Marc said: 'I got out the car and I must have walked for 50ft when I had to stop because my knees and my back were hurting so much.' Despite the warning signs Marc didn't face the facts until his sisters, Donna and Lisa, staged an intervention. They contacted their brother's doctor who sent over a crisis team of nurses. Lisa said: 'We talked for months about what we could do because we were worried sick about him. Our nana used to cry herself to sleep thinking she'd find him dead.' Donna said: 'We did not want to invade his privacy but in the end we had to because if anything happened to him we would always be thinking ""why didn't we do anything""? 'At the time I felt bad but it was the best thing we have ever done.' Although Marc had a panic attack when the nursing team arrived, he agreed to visit his GP. He said: 'He gave me three choices: I could die, I could have a gastric band or I could try to lose weight myself. 'The gastric band was not an option as both my dad and grandad had died in hospital and I was scared of surgery.' So Marc plucked up the courage to join his local Slimming World in Dunston, Gateshead. He was delighted to lose a stone in the first month and continued to lose a stone a month. He said: 'One of the scariest things I have ever done was walk through that door at Slimming World. 'It seemed like there were about 1,000 people there and as I opened the door everyone looked. It's been a breeze since then!' Now slimmed down to a more healthy 25 stone, Marc has a new lease of life. He's swapped the pork pie sandwiches for fruit throughout the day and has home-cooked pasta, curry or chilli in the evening. Now no longer housebound, Marc loves walking everywhere. Last year he was able to take Connor for a birthday weekend in Northumberland for the first time since 2006. He said: 'Before I had heard about things being built but was stuck in the  house so I never saw them. I thought ""I live in this area but I do not know it anymore"". 'So I took up photography and I go all over the place taking photographs.' The super-slimmer says he still wants to lose another six stone but isn't  worried about suffering from loose skin. He said: 'At 6ft 4ins the doctor said I should be just over 14st 2lbs. But I don't think I would look right so I'd be happy at just under 20 stone. 'My attitude might change when I have lost more weight but for now I am happy to tuck any loose skin into my pants!'",Marc became too ashamed to leave his house because of his size .

"Zoo does not want Kitra, aged 10, to breed yet . She lives in an enclosure with her father and several others . By . Nina Golgowski . Last updated at 11:09 PM on 25th January 2012 . An orangutan at a Cleveland zoo  has become the of it's kind in North America to receive an implanted birth control device. Two doctors, including a gynecologist from the Cleveland Clinic, implanted the contraceptive into the 10-year-old orangutan named Kitra on Tuesday morning. Not wanting to separate her from the group in which she lives, which includes her mother and father, the zoo worked to find a safe alternative for her. Orangutans are social animals, explained zoo spokesperson Sue Allen. Growing up: Kitra the orangutan received the first U.S. inserted contraceptive to an orangutan Tuesday after her Cleveland zoologist heard of the process successfully done overseas . Having tried with negative results other contraceptives to prevent pregnancy with the primates, the clinic's Gynecologist Dr Judith Volkar worked with the zoo's Dr. Mike Selig to implant a contraceptive called Implanon at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo after hearing of its success with primates in Europe. Dr Volkar has inserted this kind of contraceptive before in humans, for whom it was originally designed, but Kitra was her personal first orangutan. Dr Selig's who learned from her. The Implanon contraceptive, about an inch-and-a-half in length and slightly thicker than lead found in a pencil, is inserted in the arm. Typically the Implanon contraceptive is recommended to be changed every three years. Method: The chosen Implanon contraceptive, about an inch-and-a-half in length and slightly thicker than lead found in a pencil, was designed for humans and is inserted in the arm . Being a young and developing Bornean orangutan, General curator Geoffrey Hall says the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo isn't ready for her to breed, at least not yet. The zoo reported the procedure to have gone well and Kitra back on her feet within hours. 'We as humans have received so much from the animals,' Dr Volkar told Cleveland.com after the procedure. 'It's good to be able to give something back,' she said. Home and family: The orangutan from the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo lives in their rainforest portion with her mother, father and two others making her separation from the others for fear of her becoming pregnant cruel if a contraceptive wasn't found . Kitra was re-introduced to the zoo's Rain Forest exhibit that contains four other orangutans. In exchange for her help, Dr. Volkar was given a backstage tour of the zoo's more exotic animals and got to sit on a giant tortoise. When asked if she had ever had the opportunity at the Cleveland Clinic, Dr Volkar said: 'Never. Not once.' The zoo's Aldabra tortoise is described as being the size of a coffee table and weighting around 400 pounds.","Zoo does not want Kitra, aged 10, to breed yet .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:00 AM on 23rd January 2012 . A mother and her newborn baby died from the same easily treatable infection because of blunders by busy midwives. Lisa Kerr, 33, developed septic shock four days after the birth of son Jeremiah, who was born 15 weeks premature. He died from the same infection just a few days later. The family's grief was compounded even further when Ms Kerr's father David was arrested on suspicion of her murder. He spent the night of her death in a police cell. Tragic: Baby Jeremiah Kerr died after midwives failed to spot a treatable infection . 'It turns my stomach upside down when I think about what happened. It makes me feel sick,' he said. 'The . officers said there was nothing to worry about and they just wanted to . ask a few questions but then they handcuffed me. I was treated like a . criminal when I'd done nothing wrong.' Officers later realised he had nothing . to do with his daughter's death and no further action was taken against him. Mr Kerr, who works as a carpet fitter, claims he has never received an apology. An inquest into Ms Kerr's death heard how she was admitted to the labour ward at Coventry's University Hospital in the early hours of April 20 last year. She gave birth to Jeremiah but subsequently felt unwell. The coroner was told that on there separate occasions staff ignored waning signs of a serious infection. Ms Kerr, of Radford, Warwickshire, was also left for hours without regular check-ups. She was discharged from hospital on the same day she gave birth. But her condition rapidly worsened and four days later she collapsed at her father's house. She was taken to hospital but it was too late to treat her. She died of septic shock and streptococcal infection. Ms Kerr was also mother to Lael, nine, and Reuel, eight. Their father Andrew Holder said: 'Telling the kids about what happened to . Lisa was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life. 'They wanted to know where their mummy was. They really want to see her again.' 'Lisa was a good person and we all miss her.' Coventry coroner Louise Hunt said: 'The severity of Lisa's condition went unrecognised. 'Had . Lisa been recalled to hospital she would have been treated with . antibiotics which would have covered this infection and Lisa would have . survived.' Victim: Mother Lisa Kerr, seen here shortly after the birth of her daughter Lael died from the same infection. An inquest heard a simple dose of antibiotics would have prevented the 33-year-old's death . She recorded a narrative verdict on Lisa with neglect as a contributing factor. At the inquest, midwife Tolu Mayo admitted she missed out Lisa during a busy ward round because she was 'distracted' by other patients. She said: 'I was looking after quite a lot of ladies. Probably about eight of them. 'My intention was to re-check Lisa every four hours but I was very busy. It was a very demanding shift. 'In hindsight I would have done things differently. I'm sorry.' Carmel McCalmont, the hospital's head of midwifery, said Lisa's death was caused by 'human error' but insisted there were enough staff to cope with the number of patients. Test results which revealed Lisa had an infection had been relayed over the phone to someone on the ward two days before her death - but no-one remembered taking the call. The hospital's consultant obstetrician, Professor Siobhan Quenby, said: 'The microbiology lab tried to ring the result through to the labour ward. 'Our telephone records show the lab called the ward and spoke to someone for five minutes. We don't know who answered the call and no action was taken. 'Whoever had taken that call should have informed the senior midwife and on-call doctors to find out where the patient was and take action.; . Ordeal: David Kerr had to deal with being arrested and quizzed by police who initially thought Lisa's death might have been suspicious . Prof Quenby added that 'significant' changes have been put in place to educate midwives on rules and standards of care with posters and mandatory training programmes. She said: 'There were a series of errors and we are making sure these individual errors never happen again.' Lisa's father, David Kerr, told how he found his daughter lying in the hallway complaining of numb legs on the day she died. He said: 'She started going into shock so I called the ambulance - I was panicking because I could see she was in distress. Her health went downhill so quickly.' Richard Kennedy, chief medical officer at University Hospital, said: 'All staff involved in Lisa's care were shocked and saddened by her sudden death and I would like to extend my sincere sympathies to her family for their loss.' 'Following Lisa's death, we acted immediately to ensure that we have learnt lessons from this tragedy and all midwives have intensive sepsis awareness training to enable them to respond appropriately to the early signs and symptoms of this condition. 'Additionally, all high risk maternity patients are routinely observed using an early warning system which alerts staff to subtle signs of deterioration. 'Staff have been deeply affected by this tragedy and have worked hard to ensure that we improve the systems in place for vulnerable women. 'We are a busy unit delivering more than 6,000 babies a year with mothers with increasingly complex medical issues. 'Our track record in caring for both mothers and babies is exceptional and events such as this while tragic are exceedingly rare.'","Lisa Kerr, 33, died of septic shock after giving birth .

The ESO likened the image to a ‘celestial firework display’, though the nebula is sometimes referred to as ‘They Eye of God’ by astronomers. The Helix Nebula is one of the closest and most remarkable examples of a planetary nebula. Cosmic beauty: An unusual view of the Helix Nebula taken by the ESO's VISTA telescope in Chile . It lies in the constellation of Aquarius -The Water Bearer - about 700 light years from Earth. This picture, taken in infrared light by the ESO’s 4.1-metre VISTA telescope at the Paranal Observatory, reveals strands of cold nebular gas that are invisible in images taken in visible light, as well as bringing to light a rich background of stars and galaxies. Planetary nebulae actually have nothing to do with planets – they are so-named because when they were first discovered in the 18th century they resembled planets when seen through early telescopes. They are composed of dust, ionised material and molecular gas that come from a dying star shedding its outer layers. This one is evolving to become a white dwarf star and appears as the tiny blue dot seen at the centre of the image. Heavens above: The VISTA telescope also captured this amazing picture of the star formation region Messier 8, often called the Lagoon Nebula, last year . Around it the gas and dust has formed an intricate flower-like pattern, glowing in the fierce glare of ultraviolet light from the central hot star. The powerful vision of ESO’s telescope reveals the fine structure in the nebula’s rings. The infrared light picks out how the cooler, molecular gas is organised. The material clumps into filaments that radiate out from the centre. Even though they look tiny, these strands of molecular hydrogen, known as cometary knots, are about the size of our Solar System. The main ring of the Helix is about two light-years across, roughly half the distance between the Sun and the nearest star. However, material from the nebula spreads out from the star to at least four light-years. This is particularly clear in this infrared view since red molecular gas can be seen across much of the image. The molecules in them are able to survive the high-energy radiation that emanates from the dying star precisely because they clump into these knots, which in turn are shielded by dust and molecular gas. It is currently unclear how the cometary knots may have originated.","The nebula lies 700 light years from Earth .

When Volkswagen loaned out one of its top-of-the-range supercars to a UK police force, the firm must have been fairly confident the vehicle was in safe hands. But as these pictures show, the car wasn't exactly returned in the same immaculate condition in which it arrived. A Greater Manchester Police (GMP) officer was  taking the Volkswagen Golf R - which has a top speed of 155mph - for a test drive on a public road at 2am. Destroyed: This is all that remains of a £40,000 top of the range Volkswagen which was loaned to Greater Manchester Police for a test drive . GMP had borrowed the vehicle for two days so its officers could get a feel for it before the force decided whether to buy some of the cars. But, after skidding at a roundabout in Wharfside Way, Trafford Park, the unfortunate officer lost control of the £40,000 supercar. The top-of-the-range vehicle was written off and the policeman, in his 40s, had to be rescued by firefighters. The officer,  who is from the automatic number plate recognition intercept unit which patrols car crime hotspots, suffered spinal injuries and was taken to hospital, although he has since been discharged. It is not known how fast he was travelling when the accident happened. The force has now suspended him from driving duties. The car is the most powerful and fastest-accelerating Golf ever produced. It can accelerate from 0 to 62mph in just 5.7 seconds. Top condition: How the £40,000 Volkswagen Golf R should look . A senior source said: 'The car was being tested and it went horribly wrong. 'Police do use public roads to test vehicles - the risk is reduced by the location and the time when this is done.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:03 PM on 25th January 2012 . The killers of Damilola Taylor should have been hanged, the stabbed schoolboy’s father said yesterday. Richard Taylor, 63, spoke out hours after Ricky Preddie was released from prison after serving just five years of his sentence. The 24-year-old was jailed with his younger brother Danny for eight years in 2006 for the manslaughter of ten-year-old Damilola, whose death in 2000 shocked the nation. Freed: Ricky Preddie (left) was released from . Pentonville prison. He has served five years for the killing of Damilola . Taylor (right) The youngster had moved to Britain from Nigeria a few months before he was jabbed in the thigh with a broken beer bottle as he walked home from the local library after school. He was found bleeding to death in a stairwell near his home in Peckham, south London. Mr Taylor said: ‘If I had my way the two brothers would have been hung for what they did to Dami. ‘These are boys who premeditatedly attacked and killed a defenceless ten-year-old boy, and to serve just four or five years is ridiculous.’ He said he cannot forgive them because they have shown no remorse, nor apologised, for his son’s death. Heartache: Damilola's father Richard, with his late wife Gloria, who died in 2008. Mr Taylor today said in an interview he believed his son's killers 'should have been hanged' Ricky Preddie (left) and his brother Danny (right) when they were on trial over Damilola's murder . Mr Taylor said: ‘If they had used prison to reform themselves instead of just getting bigger in the gym, if they had apologised to me and my family instead of bragging about how tough they are, I would have embraced them. 'I would have hugged my son’s killers. If they had shown proper remorse, that would have warranted me to . forgive them, to talk to them about turning their lives round, and it . would have freed me to move on, too. This was a big opportunity missed. I . am not blaming the prison system because some people come out reformed, . but these brothers have never apologised. ‘So my bitterness is not only that Dami died, that my wife Gloria died four years ago because of a heart attack brought on by the stress of his death, but also that they have not shown a shred of remorse.’ Ricky Preddie was originally freed in September 2010 but was returned to jail last March after being seen in Southwark, south London, and associating with gang members – both against the terms of his release. Danny Preddie was released in September last year after serving five years of his sentence. Rickie Preddie outside the Old Bailey in 2006 during his trial . A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘The decision to release recalled offenders from custody is made by the independent Parole Board. ‘Serious offenders released on licence are subject to a strict set of conditions and controls. ‘If they fail to comply with their licence conditions, they are liable to be returned to custody.’ Last month, Damilola's father criticised the decision to give an OBE to Chris Preddie, a cousin of the killers. He said he was 'totally against' Mr . Preddie being honoured for his work with youths, calling for stricter . rules to be brought in over who should be eligible for honours. Gary Trowsdale, managing director of . the Damilola Taylor Trust, said: 'We hope that this time Ricky Preddie . can keep himself out of trouble and the Probation Service can deliver . the support he requires to do so. 'There is, of course, absolutely zero evidence that he has been reformed and, like his brother, he has never shown remorse. 'On this basis, as with every other . victims organisation in the country, we do not understand why he was . released in the first place. 'What can we do, though? The system is the system, and the system is flawed.' A . Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: 'The decision to release recalled . offenders from custody is made by the independent Parole Board - the . body solely responsible in law for determining whether or not prisoners . should be released. 'Serious offenders released on licence are subject to a strict set of conditions and controls. 'Examples . include a strict curfew and other restrictions on their movements, as . well as frequent meetings with their offender manager. 'If they fail to comply with their licence conditions, they are liable to be returned to custody.' She went on: 'They will also be managed under the statutory Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (Mappa). 'Within .

"By . Keith Gladdis . Last updated at 8:29 AM on 24th January 2012 . Harry Redknapp secretly received transfer 'bungs' worth £189,000 in a Monaco bank account opened up in the name of his pet bulldog, a court heard yesterday. The Tottenham Hotspur boss – tipped to be the next England manager – is accused of hiding the two 'off-the-record' payments in an offshore tax haven. Redknapp, 64, flew to the Mediterranean principality to open the account called Rosie 47, a combination of his dog's name and the year of his birth, a jury was told. Scroll down for video . Facing court: Harry Redknapp, right, enters Southwark Crown Court. His son Jamie, left, who is a pundit and former footballer was in the public gallery to support him . Court: Tottenham boss Harry Redknapp - who was wearing glasses - appears in the dock accused of tax evasion . Both payments were made in American . dollars by Portsmouth Football Club's chairman, Milan Mandaric, when . Redknapp worked at the club, the court heard. But the cash was 'deliberately and . dishonestly' concealed with the prime purpose of avoiding the payment of . tax, the jury was told. Prosecutor John Black QC told . Southwark Crown Court 'both parties must have known' they were avoiding . taxes. 'These payments were a bung or offshore bonus that the parties . had absolutely no intention of paying taxes for,' he said. Redknapp, who underwent heart surgery . last year to unblock his arteries, is the most successful English . manager in the modern game. He led Portsmouth to FA Cup success and . Spurs into last season's Uefa Champions' League. Mandaric, 73, is now . chairman of Sheffield Wednesday, and has previously worked at Leicester . City. Man's best friend: Redknapp with his pet bull dogs Rosie, left, who the account was named after, and Buster . Mr Black told the court Redknapp was . 'no ordinary employee' of Portsmouth and had the 'greatest capacity to . influence the success or failure of his football club'. He said: 'He is currently enjoying . football success as manager of Tottenham Hotspur. They are currently . riding high and I think today they are placed third in the Premier . League. Even in the early 2000s, it was obvious he was unusually . talented.' But he added: 'Talented and popular he might have been, the . Crown say he was nevertheless a hard-headed businessman, with a . financial acumen and pecuniary sense of his influence to his employers.' The court heard Redknapp had a series . of lucrative bonuses built into his contract when he was made director . of football at Portsmouth in 2001, including 10 per cent of any profit . made from any players he bought and sold. Those bonuses could total up to £500,000 depending on profits the club made from transfers. However, the court heard that in 2002 – . when Redknapp went from being director of football to the club's team . manager – the bonus for trading players was halved to 5 per cent. Accused: Tottenham Hotspur manager Harry Redknapp arrives at Southwark Crown Court where he faces trial over tax evasion charges . Plush: Harry Redknapp's £10million home in Sandbanks, Poole, Dorset . Eight days after Redknapp joined . Portsmouth in June 2001, England striker Peter Crouch was bought from . Queen's Park Rangers for £1.25million. Crouch stayed at Portsmouth for nine months before being sold to Aston Villa for more than £4million in 2002, the court heard. The net profit of the sale was . £2.3million, but, because of the revised terms of Redknapp's new . contract, he was due only 5 per cent of that, which was £115,473. This . was paid to him via his wages. But Mr Black said the pair made an . 'off-the-record' arrangement to compensate Redknapp for taking a smaller . cut after the deal had gone through. He added: 'It seemed clear that Mr . Mandaric and Mr Redknapp arranged that Redknapp, in addition to being . paid by the club any sums due to him under the new transfer bonus . clause, would receive sums off the record. 'Such off-the-record sums would remain hidden from the UK tax authorities. That is what the Crown say is exactly what happened.' Charges: Former Portsmouth owner Milan Mandaric, left, arrives at Southwark Crown Court where he faces charges of tax evasion . The court heard Redknapp waited just . four days after receiving the legal bonus from the Crouch sale before . taking steps to ensure that he would receive 'what he regarded was his . due'. The court heard how he flew to Monaco . to open the private Rosie 47 HSBC account. The prosecution said there . was no good reason why the account couldn't have been opened in . Redknapp's own name. It is alleged that Mandaric, a Serbian billionaire, . made two payments into the account. The first charge relates to £93,000 . allegedly paid by Mandaric to Redknapp's account between April 1, 2002, . and November 28, 2007, without paying NI contributions or tax. The . second relates to £96,500 allegedly paid by Mandaric to Redknapp between . May 1, 2004, and November 28, 2007, again into the Monaco account . without paying NI contributions or tax. The jury has not been told why the second payment was made. But the Monaco bank account eventually . came to light during an inquiry into illicit payments in football led . by Lord Stevens, the former Metropolitan Police commissioner. Claims: Redknapp and Mandaric were both at Portsmouth Football Club in the period to which the charges relate. The club play at Fratton Park . Tottenham boss: Harry Redknapp on the touchline as his team were beaten 3-2 by fellow title chasers Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium . The results of that investigation, . known as the Quest inquiry, was handed to the Premier League chief . executive, Richard Scudamore, in July 2007. Redknapp had been investigated by HM . Revenue & Customs officials over his transfer dealings at one of his . previous clubs, West Ham United, the court heard. But he made no . mention of the Monaco account when interviewed in November 2006. This . probe, between January 2004 and October 2006, 'was originally prompted . by concerns over a £300,000 payment' regarding profit made in the . transfer of Rio Ferdinand. Mr Black said: 'That was the first . time anyone heard of the Monaco bank account.' He added: 'It is . significant, the Crown suggests, that the bank account opened by Mr . Mandaric was located in an offshore tax haven. 'The Crown suggests this was quite . deliberate and was intended to obscure and to render less transparent . the nature of the money payments.' Redknapp, who lives in Poole, Dorset, . was dressed in a dark blue suit, white shirt and tie. He had arrived in . court with his son Jamie, an ex-player and respected football pundit. Redknapp senior sat next to Mandaric . behind toughened bulletproof glass in the witness box. He and Mandaric, . of Oadby, Leicestershire, deny two counts of cheating the public . revenue.

A prolific burglar who had his ill-gotten gains seized has vowed to go on a crime spree once he is released from prison to get the money back. Ronnie Tretton had more than £1,000 confiscated under the Proceeds of Crime Act - but he told a court he would step up his crime rate once he got out of jail. Tretton, 27, of Leigh-on-Sea, made the comments as he was led to the cells at Southend Magistrates' Court, during a Proceeds of Crime Act hearing. He shouted from the dock: 'When I get out there will be a lot of burglaries. I will get . that money back. 'Watch the crime rate when I get out. How about that?' Tretton, who was dubbed 'one of Southend's most prolific burglars', was the first person in the Essex town to be given an Asbo in 2003. He has 88 previous offences, including 25 theft-related crimes, the court was told. He was taken to court after police found a large sum of cash on him. On this occasion he was arrested in suspicion of burglary - for which he was never charged - and police secured a court order to keep most of the money. Fiona . Philpott, prosecuting on behalf of Essex Police, said: 'Mr Tretton is . one of the most prolific burglars within the Southend area and is . currently on bail relating to a burglary committed on June 24, the day . before the money was seized.' She said police believed the money had come from the burglary on June 23, or other burglaries he had been involved in. Outburst: Tretton made the comments as he was led to the cells at Southend Magistrates' Court (pictured), during a Proceeds of Crime Act hearing . The . court heard he had been bailed until February 20 accused of four . different burglaries but he is currently in prison, having been . convicted of a separate domestic assault. Miss . Philpott added: 'It's also apparent from analysis of his mobile phone . that he is expected by at least one friend to supply drugs.' Tretton said the £1287.68 police found him with was money he was looking after on behalf of someone else. He said his relative, Christine Tretton, of Southend, was an alcoholic and had given him the cash so she wouldn't spend it. However, when police first interviewed her she said she had given Tretton just £250. But . Miss Tretton told the court this was because she had been drunk at the . time she gave her statement to police, and actually it was £1,240. Tretton is currently in jail after appearing at Southend Magistrates Court on January 9, where he pleaded guilty to assault. He was subject to recall to prison at the time, and was jailed for six weeks. A restraining order was also made to prevent him from contacting the victim, Geneve Davis, for the next two years. Tretton will lose £1,037.68 of the cash, and he and Miss Tretton must pay £700 court costs between them.",Burglar dubbed 'one of Southend's most prolific' tells court: 'Watch the crime rate when I get out'

David Cameron has revealed that his daughter Nancy is a budding entrepreneur who sold mince pies to his protection officers for £1 each. At the launch of a new business campaign, the Prime Minister told how his eldest daughter asked to make the pies on New Year's Day and then flogged them to his detectives. 'Eight years old, I think it's a good spark of enterprise,' he told a group of entrepreneurs during a visit to Leeds. Budding entrepreneur: David Cameron with Nancy (left) and son Elwen . Nancy holds the hand . Mr Cameron's anecdote came as he . risked another row with France by declaring that the country's 35-hour . working week had been bad for its economy. The . Prime Minister said it was a 'mistake' for countries to think there is a . fixed number of jobs that can be 'carved up' equally between workers.  During . visit to Leeds, Mr Cameron said: 'I don't think the right way to think . about an economy is that there's just a fixed number of jobs and it's a . question of how you carve them up between young people, middle aged . people and older people. Mr Cameron once again risked the ire of Nicolas Sarkozy after suggesting that a 35-hour week for France had failed . 'I . think that's the sort of mistake that other countries have made, when . for instance, they've introduced a 35-hour working week. 'They think 'Well, let's have a . 35-hour working week for everybody and then we share out the jobs that . are available, what we find happens then is that your businesses become . more expensive to run than anybody else's, you lose out to the . competition and you have less jobs in the economy.' French President Nicholas Sarkozy recently objected to the Prime Minister lecturing Europe over its debt crisis. 'We . are sick of you criticising us and telling us what to do,' he said at . the time. 'You say you hate the euro and now you want to interfere in . our meetings.' Meanwhile, . Mr Cameron announced that hundreds of empty Government offices will be . thrown open to small firms in a bid to kick-start the economy. Mr . Cameron wants budding entrepreneurs to be offered cheap rent deals on . vacant and under-used Government buildings until they have established . themselves. The Prime Minister said that it was wrong for so many of the buildings to be sitting 'idle' when they could be used by small businesses. There are an estimated 300 vacant Government buildings across the country – some of which have been empty for more than a decade. While the properties lie empty, some have been costing taxpayers large sums in rent, business rates and other charges. The Prime Minister also launched a campaign aimed at encouraging people to believe 'there is a business in everyone'. The Business in You drive will see companies hold workshops and give advice on tackling some of the issues faced by would-be bosses, with the scheme highlighted in radio, newspaper and billboard adverts throughout the year. Mr Cameron said: 'I said 2012 has got to be the year we go for it, the year we light new fires of ambition in our economy, the year we get behind Britain's grafters, doers, hard-workers and entrepreneurs. 'This isn't something we'd quite like to do - it's something we've got to do because enterprise is critical to this country's future. 'Enterprise is what we do in Britain. This is the year that, more than ever, we've got to go for it.'",Nancy sold Christmas treats for £1 each .
"Jacob Hancock, 18, had his towel urinated on by teammates . High school senior suffered mental breakdown after relentless attacks . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:54 PM on 24th January 2012 . Desperate: Jacob Hancock, 18, committed suicide after being tormented for years at North Sanpete high school in Utah . Parents have filed a wrongful death lawsuit after claiming a school failed to protect their son from years of . bullying, hazing and false sex assault allegations that led to his . suicide. Bradd and . Edna Hancock were seeking unspecified financial damages against North Sanpete . School District in the document filed on January 17. Their son Jacob Hancock, 18, took his own life on January . 21, 2010 in Fountain Green, Utah. The high school senior was the target of . physical and emotional abuse from students and school district employees . for more than five years. The school failed to adequately protect the teenager according to Sonny Olsen, an attorney for the Hancock family. It was not clear why Jacob Hancock was targeted but court papers said the bullying and harassment began with . gay slurs from three male students while Hancock was in the eighth . grade. The abuse escalated to physical assaults, including . pushing Jacob Hancock against a wall and a fist fight that ended with . all involved being referred to juvenile court, the lawsuit stated. One . assault occurred while Jacob Hancock was naked and showering in the . boys' locker room.  Teammates reportedly touched his genitals and urinated on . his towel. Following a complaint from his parents, the school district offered to buy Jacob Hancock a new towel. Similar attacks continued for 18 . months without intervention by the district, the lawsuit claims, increasing Jacob Hancock's . anxieties and negatively affecting his academic performance. Jacob . Hancock began to lash out at others and suffered a mental . breakdown where he was placed on suicide watch. The bullying and harassment continued into high . school and included at least one death threat from another student. Agitated and unable to sleep, Jacob Hancock first attempted suicide in . 2008, court papers stated. Compensation: Jacob Hancock's parents are suing North Sanpete school district in Utah as they claim that employees failed to protect their son from years of bullying . The harassment continued in 2009, . including incidents in which Jacob Hancock was physically restrained by a school police officer and hit by another. The same year, a football . coach said publicly that he believed Hancock looked like a pedophile. The lawsuit also alleged that a high school . vice-principal publicly discussed Jacob Hancock's emotional struggles . with teachers and students, including stating that Hancock had suffered a . mental breakdown. 'It's not like Jacob was a . kid that nobody knew about. It we can't save a kid in that . setting, then either our policies are wrong or the people that are . executing them are not the right people.' Sonny Olsen, attorney for Hancock family . After his father Bradd Hancock complained about the . administrator's actions, Jacob Hancock was accused of sexually abusing a . teenage girl and was arrested. The girl later said she had only been 'tickled' and the charges were reduced. Jacob . Hancock was suspended from school and then unsuccessfully tried to . enroll elsewhere. Those efforts were blocked by false . reports from the Sanpete school district that Hancock had been expelled, according to records. Jacob Hancock committed suicide a few months later. The lawsuit contends that district . officials failed to protect Jacob Hancock properly and did not implement . existing policies against bullying, hazing . and suicide prevention. Mr Olsen said: 'It's not like Jacob was a . kid that nobody knew about. It we can't save a kid in that . setting, then either our policies are wrong or the people that are . executing them are not the right people.' The lawsuit names the school district, its board and the Sanpete County sheriff's . office, which provides schools with campus-based officers, as defendants. The North Sanpete High School and Middle School principals were also . individually named in the lawsuit, as were other school employees . and two police officers. Victoria Schoenfeld, spokeswoman for the Division of Risk . Management, said: 'We . have received the complaint and we understand a suit has been filed, . but we're in a phase right now where we are still gathering . information.' Sanpete County Attorney Brody Keisel said the sheriff's office was aware of . the lawsuit and will defend itself against the claims. Family lawyer Mr Olsen said . the Hancocks were bringing the lawsuit two years after their son's . death because continued inquiries into how Jacob Hancock was treated . suggested school officials were negligent in their handling of the . situation. The lawsuit stated: 'As reported by other students and peers, the . harassing conduct was so prevalent and obvious that the responsible . adults must have known, and indeed, witnesses it. 'J.H.'s actions in taking his own life were a foreseeable result of the . defendant's tortuous acts.'","Jacob Hancock, 18, had his towel urinated on by teammates .

Whitehall sources believe Mr Hester may . see the maximum bonus he is entitled to of £1.5 million cut in half to . £750,000 in order to show that the coalition is reining in executive . pay. Asked recently if the government will use . its shareholding to keep Mr Hester’s bonus under £1 million, the Prime . Minister said: ‘The short answer is yes.’ Directors of RBS - which is 83 per cent owned by taxpayers - meet today amid calls last night from Bank of England Governor Sir Mervyn King for the City to ‘limit’ the annual bonus bonanza. Government officials will send a 'strong message' to the committee that Mr Hester's pay must be cut. But even a £750,000 payment is set to spark fury at the failure of ministers to strip the chief-executive of a bonus altogether in a year when RBS has seen its share price collapse by 40 per cent. The fear is that the well regarded Mr Hester will quit RBS if he is refused a bonus - and ministers believe he is doing a good job. Speaking in Brighton last night, Sir Mervyn said the bonus bonanza comes at a time when ordinary workers are suffering ‘a ferocious squeeze’ on their take-home pay. He said soaring inflation has led to ‘the longest period over which real wages have failed to rise since the 1920s’. Sir Mervyn said: ‘The tragedy of the financial crisis is that those who have suffered most have been those who bear no responsibility for it.’ He added it would be wrong ‘if rewards . go disproportionately to a small elite, especially one which benefited . from the support of taxpayers.’ There . is intense pressure for Mr Hester to show restraint in the size of . bonus that he accepts, particularly after his rival at Lloyds, Antonio . Horta-Osorio, recently refused a bonus. Bonus cap: David Cameron has intervened to slash Mr Hester's bonus. Vince Cable, right, said the Government was in an 'uncomfortable position' as it attempted to limit executive payouts . In a refreshing break from tradition, the Portuguese-born boss said he did not want to be considered for a bonus, which could have been up to £2.4million. He said the decision was triggered by ‘the tough financial circumstances that many people are facing’, as well as his recent two-month absence following a severe attack of insomnia. But banking and government sources say Mr Hester is adamant he deserves his bonus for his role at the helm of the disgraced Scottish banking giant, which was kept afloat with £45billion of taxpayers’ money. But Business Secretary Vince Cable last night admitted the government is in an ‘uncomfortable’ position as it tries to persuade RBS and Lloyds Banking Group to slash bonuses. ‘We’ve got this rather uncomfortable halfway house position between meddling and being hands-off,’ Mr Cable said yesterday. ‘There’s quite a lot of feedback into RBS over the government’s concern about bonus culture, where you’ve got a company that’s not just publicly owned but losing money, and I think that’s had an effect.’ At the RBS board meeting today, Mr Hester’s bonus will be discussed but a decision may, or may not, be made. Last year, the decision involved two meetings. A petition, organised by Avaaz, the campaigning website, calling on the Government to stop RBS bonuses has attracted more than 90,000 signatures since it was launched on Saturday. Alex Wilks, campaign director at Avaaz said: ‘The proposed fat cat bonuses are an absolute outrage. With taxpayers owning 83 per cent of RBS, the Government must act.’ A spokesman for Downing Street insisted the Prime Minister did not have the power to intervene directly to set the chief-executives pay.","Stephen Hester under pressure to follow lead of Lloyds boss Antonio Horta-Osorio who REFUSED a bonus .

"By . Chris Parsons . Last updated at 9:11 AM on 26th January 2012 . Guilty: Joyce, 23, fought Doherty and bit off part of his ear . A cousin of Celebrity Big Brother winner Paddy Doherty who bit off the ear of the reality star in a bare-knuckle street brawl has been jailed. Johnny Joyce, 21, sank his teeth into the Big Fat Gypsy Wedding star's ear during a fierce gypsy brawl outside a PC World in Manchester. The fight between Joyce and 52-year-old Doherty was filmed on a mobile phone and loaded to YouTube, showing the blood-splattered reality TV star grappling with his cousin in front of rush hour traffic. The 'revolting' brawl in June last . year had been sparked by a long-running family feud which saw Doherty . claim he had 'shunned' by the gypsy community over his celebrity status. During . the fight, Joyce's brother Dougie, 23, was overheard baying for blood . shouting: 'Come you dirty Doherty bast**d, give it to him Johnny, give . to the dirty tramp, floor the dirty tramp.' Celebrity Big brother winner Doherty later underwent surgery to have ear sewn back on. He himself admitted affray but was given a suspended jail term earlier this month. Today Joyce, of Middleton also admitted affray but was jailed after Manchester Crown Court was told he had a history of violence. In sentencing Joyce to 15 months jail, Judge Martin Steiger condemned the 'revolting nature of this family feud'. Scrap: Footage of the fight shows Doherty, right, grappling with his cousin Joyce as the gypsy family's feud boiled over in public . Shocking: The pair scrapped in broad daylight in front of stunned motorists outside the PC World in Manchester . Bloodied: Paddy Doherty after part of his ear was bitten off, in an image originally posted to his Twitter page . The judge added: 'Whatever the right and wrong of this feud I have to pass sentence regardless of how this incident started. 'I am prepared to accept that Paddy Doherty may have made the first move but what happened thereafter was that the wrong doing was on the side of Johnny Joyce. 'Traffic was held up and members of the public were frightened and Doherty received the worst injuries, he was bleeding from his face and his ear was badly bitten. It's preposterous to say that this action resulted from self defence. 'Johnny Joyce has the worst record for . violence and furthermore the probation officer recommends a custodial . sentence with Johnny Joyce having made it quite clear he wasn't prepared . to consider unpaid work.' Doherty himself escaped jail when he was handed a 51-week suspended sentence for the brawl earlier this month . The fight was the latest round of a bloody feud between Doherty and the Joyce brothers which was sparked by a row at a family funeral. In August 2010 a shooting took place at the home of Johnny's mother after he handed himself in over an earlier bust up with Doherty at his caravan site. Then in February 2011 Johnny was tried and acquitted of causing grievous boldly harm after claiming he acted in self defence. Four months later Johnny and 23-year old Dougie ran into Doherty on busy Great Ancoats street in Manchester while the TV star was out jogging and the Joyce brothers were shopping for a birthday present. Prosecuting, Mr Richard Vardon, said: 'There is and was at the relevant time bad blood between Doherty on the one hand and Johnny and Dougie on the other. 'The footage shows a fight and on the recording Dougie Joyce can be heard encouraging Johnny to hit Doherty and not to stop.' Johnny had previous convictions for assault in 2005, robbery and dangerous driving in 2006, an assault in the street in 2007 and a GBH beating in a nightclub in 2008. Reality star Doherty, pictured here with fellow Celebrity Big Brother star Sally Bercow, said he has been 'shunned' by the gypsy community over his celebrity status . In mitigation his counsel Michael Lavery, said the three men were arguing when Doherty said 'come on fight with me' and removed his inch think gold ring. Mr Lavery added: 'He invited a fight and a fight is what he got. The fact that Doherty received more serious injuries shouldn't be taken into account, that shows who were the stronger and more fortunate. 'When one engages in a fight willingly or enters into it one is likely to be injured. The fact that he received more injuries than Johnny Joyce is not something that should be held against Johnny Joyce, when both men were prepared to fight each other. Violence: Doherty and his cousin were involved in a fight outside a PC world, similar to this one, in Manchester . 'Mr Doherty is a man who has previously made something of a career from himself as being a man who is prepared to use violence. 'He had used that in the media to his advantage in the TV show Britain's Most Dangerous Men. 'He said: ‘when I fight I would bite them, bite their ears, bite their noses and swallow it to permanently disfigure them, I wouldn't spit it out so it couldn't be sewn back on'. 'It's as a result of that programme that his career as a celebrity started and he became a person with a certain notoriety in the gypsy community. 'There has to be a point where these two parties stop acting in this way and I'm told by Johnny Joyce that this happens today.' Boxer Dougie admitted using threatening behaviour and was given a 12 month community order. He was also ordered to complete 150 hours unpaid work and pay £500 costs.","Johnny Joyce bit off Doherty's ear in street brawl .

"By . Claire Ellicott . Created 9:43 PM on 25th January 2012 . An executive at an exclusive private hospital is seeking more than £1million in damages after suffering a breakdown she claims was caused by her ‘megalomaniac’ boss. Sandra King claims she suffered post-traumatic stress disorder after she was bullied by the man who took over the management of the Cromwell Hospital in central London, which is now run by Bupa. Mrs King, 53, alleges the acting chief executive at the hospital said she was ‘special’ and told her about his sex life in late night phone calls. Stress: Sandra King, pictured with her husband Graham, is seeking £1m in damages after she suffered a breakdown following alleged abuse from her boss at a private hospital . The mother-of-two told the High Court that the ‘charming’ doctor had initially taken her into his confidence and told her she was ‘the only one he could trust’. But his behaviour changed  after the Abu Dhabi royal family, who run the private hospital, had  promoted Dr Abdul Al Muhairi  to acting chief executive officer in 2005. As he gained more power, her  colleague became a ‘dictator and megalomaniac’ who phoned her late at night and shouted at her, she claimed. Mrs King, who had worked at the hospital for 23 years, said: ‘When he took over the job he completely changed from this pleasant man into this awful, awful person.’ Her counsel, Simon Livingstone, told Deputy Judge John Leighton Williams QC that Mrs King had initially tried to ‘laugh off’ his actions. Accused: Dr Abdul Al Muhairi is said to have made late night phone calls to Mrs King in which he spoke about his sex life and shouted abuse at her . But when Dr Al Muhairi assumed the role of acting CEO, a picture emerged of ‘over-familiarity, innuendo, on occasions inappropriate physical contact, personal and professional humiliation… veiled threats and blackmail.’ At one stage Dr Al Muhairi sent Mrs King a ‘special Christmas gift’. When she opened it, she was shocked to find it contained nothing but male toiletries, and told her husband when she saw it: ‘So this is his special gift’. She later tried to convince herself that the ‘odd’ gift was an accident, with the present perhaps intended for a male colleague, but she finally concluded that it was a ‘deliberate and offensive act’. The former executive manager at the hospital said her treatment became intolerable and she was forced to quit her role. She has been unable to work since 2006 due to the stress she suffered and has undergone counselling at the Priory Clinic. Prior to that, Mr Livingstone said Mrs King had been a ‘consummate professional’, an ambitious and able woman, who excelled at her job and was respected by her colleagues. Medical Services International Ltd, who run the Cromwell, deny responsibility for her breakdown, instead blaming it on marriage difficulties, having to bring up an autistic son and medical problems from going through the menopause. Yesterday, John Williams, representing the hospital, claimed Mrs King had struck up a friendship with Dr Al Muhairi at a time when she ‘craved friendly male attention’ after her husband had been made redundant. Denial: Medical Servce International Ltd, which own Bupa Cromwell Hospital, pictured, say that Mrs King's breakdown was caused by marriage difficulties and raising an autistic son . He claimed she was nursing a grievance because Dr Al Muhairi had earlier been appointed company secretary instead of her. Mrs King said a colleague had told her Dr Al Muhairi had opposed her appointment, but the prosecution suggested other members of the board had been behind the move. Mr Williams said: ‘You have constructed in your own mind that in some way Dr Al Muhairi is to blame that he became company secretary and you did not.’ He added: ‘You spent a long time at the hospital. You were a career woman. You had your children and you returned to work and work formed a big part of your life and you wanted that job. ‘Your personal life was empty at this time. You were very committed to your work and Dr Al Muhairi when you started to work with him. ‘You had a professional relationship and he was seen by you as offering you friendship. ‘You had invested yourself both professionally in terms of your career and personally in terms of your friendship.’ Dr Al Muhairi left the hospital in 2008. The case continues.",Sandra King claims Dr Abdul Al Muhairi told her about his sex life in late night phone calls .

"By . Katherine Faulkner . Last updated at 6:43 AM on 27th January 2012 . A burglar who was freed from prison because he had five children to look after is facing another jail term for assault. Wayne Bishop carried out the attack just a few weeks after he was controversially let out of prison last year. In a decision that sparked outrage, Appeal Court judges released him from an eight-month sentence for burglary and dangerous driving because of his ‘human right’ to a family life. Out of jail: Burglar Wayne Bishop celebrates his release last year with his five children and is pictured with a 'world's best dad' mug . They said it was not in the ‘best interests’ of his five young children for the convicted burglar to be in prison. Jobless Bishop, who admitted he had ‘never thought’ the judges would free him, claimed at the time that he was ‘going straight’ for the sake of his children. But just four weeks later he attacked a man in broad daylight after chasing him into a Spar supermarket. A . court heard yesterday how horrified shoppers looked on as Bishop . repeatedly punched his victim in the head while his brother held him in a . headlock. The ‘premeditated’ attack left victim David Parsons with a ‘bruised and swollen’ face, prosecutors said. Bishop, and his brother, unemployed bouncer Robert Wheelhouse, denied the assault at Nottingham Magistrates’ Court yesterday. But they were found guilty after a judge saw CCTV of the incident and dismissed their account of events as ‘implausible and untrue’. Bishop, 34, who has a string of previous convictions, was warned he faces up to six months in prison when he is sentenced next month. But last night his lawyer said Bishop planned to try to use his children to avoid jail once more. Solicitor Timothy Holder said: ‘Wayne is still responsible for all his five children. We will be asking the court to take into account his responsibilities towards his childcare duties.’ Family man? Bishop with his children after winning an appeal in May last year . At the time of the attack, Bishop had just started the 24-month suspended sentence given to him by the Court of Appeal. CCTV footage of the attack showed 40-year-old Wheelhouse grabbing Mr Parsons, 23, and swinging him around to face Bishop. Tattooed . Bishop is then seen shouting at his victim before appearing to throw a . punch. Frightened customers can be seen fleeing the store as the . brothers release the victim, who is left rubbing his battered face. After he was arrested, Bishop refused to answer any questions. He also declined to give evidence yesterday. His brother told the court they had . gone after Mr Parsons because he had ‘insulted and attacked’ a niece of . his and Bishop’s. Police however said they had no record of any such . attack. Finding the pair . guilty, District Judge Pyle told Bishop he would be sentenced at . Nottingham Crown Court so that ‘it can deal with all matters against . you.’ He said: ‘This assault in itself might . not warrant custody but a crown court will want to know that you are in . breach of a suspended sentence.’ Bishop gained notoriety last May . after successfully appealing against his eight-month prison sentence for . a burglary at Mansfield Rugby Club. His legal team argued his imprisonment went against Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention – which enshrines the right to respect for family life. The decision was condemned by Bishop’s neighbours, who described him as ‘nothing but trouble’. Bishop, from Clifton, Nottingham, argued at the time that he was the sole carer for his five children – Courteney, 13, Katie, 11, Taylor, nine, Brandon, seven, and Kyle, six – for five nights of the week and they were bereft without him. Their mother, his ex partner Tracey York, 30, could only have the children at weekends because she worked shifts. Bishop has previous convictions for shoplifting, driving without a licence or insurance, three convictions for driving while disqualified, and two convictions for threatening behaviour. He refused to comment as he left court on bail yesterday.","Wayne Bishop released after Appeal Court judges accept 'right to family life' plea .

"By . Steve Doughty . Last updated at 8:26 AM on 26th January 2012 . Pricey: The Right Reverend John Packer's home was bought and renovated by the church at a cost of more than £1m - and even has a special outhouse for bats . Senior bishops have been ordered to cut the lavish costs of running their palaces and mansions by more than a quarter. The spending cap, confirmed yesterday by Church of England officials, will be lowered by a further third from 2014. The disclosure comes in a week that has seen five bishops lead a rebellion in the House of Lords against Coalition plans to cap the cost of benefits payments. They are among the 44 diocesan bishops who are covered by the spending restrictions on accommodation, as are the Archbishops of Canterbury and York. The five bishops opposed a £26,000 cap on benefits, claiming it would disproportionately affect families with children and make them homeless. Anglican economist Ruth Lea said yesterday: ‘Now the Church recognises that it has to live within its own budget, perhaps the bishops could recognise that the Government needs to do the same.Which bit of hypocrisy is it that they have trouble spelling? ‘If they are really worried about children, perhaps they should think of the children who will have to pay off the Government’s debts in 20 or 30 years’ time.’ The bishops were also rebuked by former Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey, who wrote in the Mail yesterday that they would doom families to remaining benefit-dependent and workless. Dr Carey added that the bishops had ignored the impact of taxation on millions of working people who pay for state benefits but live on much less than £26,000 themselves. The bishop who led the rebellion – which also included the Bishops of Chichester, Lichfield, Leicester and Manchester – was the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds, the Right Reverend John Packer. The style in which he is accustomed to living perhaps gives an insight into why he and his colleagues feel £26,000 a year is too little for a family to get by on. Four years ago he moved into a house bought and renovated by the Church at a cost of more than £1million. Expenses included moving a colony of bats into a specially constructed outhouse run. All 44 bishops have now been told that the total maintenance and refurbishment bill for their homes must be kept below £5million a year for three years. The limit, which came into effect last year, is down from £7million a year over the previous three years. It is hoped the move will dispel the . impression that senior clergy are enjoying lavish lifestyles at the . expense of ordinary churchgoers. The cap means that average spending on a bishop’s home will have to come down from just under £160,000 a year to £114,000. Attack: Lord Carey launched a rebuke against bishops who had voted against a cap on benefits at £26,000 in yesterday's Daily Mail . This figure includes the cost of buying new homes and necessary repairs. But, according to Church documents, ‘the average ongoing maintenance costs of some houses is now well over £50,000 a year’. Papers circulated by the CofE’s parliament, the General Synod, reveal the findings of a meeting of senior figures staged by the Church in 2009. It concluded: ‘Some very large sums have been spent on some of the properties recently and the average cost of maintaining each property was very high.’ The CofE then proceeded to plan a spending cap. Synod Secretary-General William Fittall set out the reasoning in a paper: ‘There was recognition that the large sums spent on see houses provoked questions about the style, scale and expectations of bishops’ ministry.’ Successive attempts to curb bishops’ extravagant spending on their ‘see homes’ have failed to slow the increase in costs. A Church review a decade ago called for bishops to live in homes with no more than six bedrooms and to restrict their use of gardeners and chauffeurs. Yet in the three years from 2008 to 2010, spending on bishops’ accommodation rocketed to £21million, or £7million a year. Mr Fittall proposed a total £15million spending cap over the 2011-2013 period, to be reduced to £10million for 2014-16. The Reverend Paul Dawson, a South London vicar and spokesman for the Church’s conservative evangelical Reform group, said: ‘Everyone is having to cut their cloth and bishops are no different from the rest of us.’","Bishops will face a futher cut of a third in 2014 .

"By . Michael Zennie and Jennifer Madison . Last updated at 1:24 PM on 23rd January 2012 . Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords will resign from Congress this week, a year after she was shot in the head while meeting constituents in Tucson. Giffords made the announcement in a YouTube video posted Sunday afternoon in which she explained in a halting, sometimes slurred, voice that she must continue healing before she can represent residents of her district again. 'I have more work to do on my recovery so to do what is best for Arizona I will step down this week,' she said. Stepping down: Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords announced her resignation in a YouTube video Sunday afternoon. She said she still has to recover . However, she vowed to step back into public life when her rehabilitation is complete. 'I'm getting better every day. My spirit is high. I will return and we will work together for Arizona and this great country.' The two-minute video features images from her recovery, which has captivated the country. It also shows images of the vibrant 41-year-old Congresswoman before the attack, her wavy blond locks a contrast to the close-cropped style she has worn since undergoing several emergency brain surgeries. 'A lot has happened over the past year. We cannot change that,' she says. 'I don't remember much from that horrible day but I will never forget the trust you placed in me to be your voice.' As her final act as congresswoman in her district, Giffords will finish the meet-and-greet political event today that erupted in the deadly spree. Giffords' office says the . congresswoman will finish the Congress On Your Corner event. In a . private gathering, she will meet with some of the people who were at the . January 8, 2011 event in a Safeway parking lot when a gunman killed six . people and wounded 13 others, including Giffords. Dramatic change: The shooting has changed Giffords' appearance and made it difficult for her to speak and walk . Those attending will include some of the wounded, others who helped them, and people who subdued the attacker. Giffords will also visit a family assistance centre that was set up after she was seriously wounded. The announcement of her last congressional duties came after President Barack Obama praised . Representative Giffords, calling her an 'inspiration' and 'the very best . of what public service should be.' 'I'm getting better every day. My spirit is high. I will return and we will work together for Arizona and this great country.' - Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords . Mr Obama recognised Giffords for her . 'dedication to fairness, a willingness to listen to different ideas, and . a tireless commitment to the work of perfecting our union.' He says Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, 'have taught us the true meaning of hope in the face of despair' and 'determination in the face of incredible odds.' The president says the congresswoman's 'cheerful presence will be missed in Washington.' The congresswoman's decision to step down from her seat opens up a wide-open race to fill her spot in her southeastern Arizona district. It will set up not one but two entire elections cycles, with new congressional lines in each thanks to congressional redistricting. Governor Jan Brewer will call a special primary election sometime in April and then a general election in June to fill Gifford's seat in the 8th Congressional District. That will be followed by a regular primary and general election for the new 2nd District. Recovering: Giffords and Kelly made a much-celebrated appearance at a memorial marking the one-year anniversary of the shooting spree . The . three-term Democrat was widely considered a shoo-in for re-election . because of her tragic shooting at a Tucson constituent meeting a year . ago. On January 8, 2011, . Jared Lee Loughner opened fire on Giffords and several people she was . meeting at a Safeway grocery store outside Tucson, authorities said. Six people, including federal judge John Roll and a nine-year-old girl were killed. The attack left Giffords fighting for her life after she suffered significant brain trauma from a gunshot wound. She . has recently begun appearing in public after being released from the . hospital, including a much-celebrated appearance in Congress August 1. Giffords recently appeared at a memorial marking the one-year anniversary of the shooting spree. The Congresswoman, who had to re-learn how to walk, stepped onto the podium at the event and recited the pledge of allegiance while an adoring crowd chanted her name. Though she has made a dramatic recovery since doctors put her in a drug-induced coma directly after the shooting, her resignation from Congress cannot be considered a dramatic surprise. In an interview with ABC News in November, Giffords said she would not return to work until she was fully recovered. Giffords has only been back to Congress once since the shooting, a surprise visit in August during the debt ceiling debate . Her public appearances have revealed that she has trouble forming sentences and communicating as she once did. Giffords' speech therapist has said the Congresswoman still has a lot of work to do before she has fully recovered. If she had stayed in office, she would have faced the possibility of having to defend her seat in the November election. The moderate Democrat narrowly won a third term after a hard-fought re-election campaign in 2010. Her resignation will lead to a special election in June to fill her seat until the general election in November. Some have speculated her husband Mark Kelly, who has been her constant companion during her recovery, will run for her seat. Kelly, a NASA astronaut, commanded the space shuttle Endeavor's final mission into space in May. If he does run, he will have access to the $875,000 Giffords has in her campaign coffers. The resignation garnered praise for Giffords from both side of the political aisle. 'Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords has been a true bright star - a dynamic and creative public servant. Gabby’s message of bipartisanship and civility is one that all in Washington and the nation should honour and emulate,' House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement.

A five-year-old girl who recovered from a brain tumour was forced to clean up her own urine in front of her classmates after wetting herself. Liberty Rose Finn underwent nine grueling months of chemotherapy to overcome cancer. But the illness left her with disabilities which often result in her wetting herself. Brave: Liberty Rose Finn recovered from cancer but the illness results in her occasionally wetting herself. Her mother Dawn is furious after her daughter was forced to clean up her own urine after wetting herself at school . After an accident in the classroom at Church Gresley Infant and Nursery School, in Swadlincote, south Derbyshire, the youngster was forced to clean up her own mess in front of her classmates. A teacher then ordered her to stand facing a wall for 10 minutes. It left her parents Carl and Dawn Finn furious. Initially they kept quiet about the incident while the school conducted an investigation. But the couple decided to break their silence after receiving a letter from the school which said it had ‘fully investigated’ the incident and the ‘matter had been dealt with’. It also said appropriate action had been taken and the member of staff concerned ‘deeply regrets what has happened’. The family, from Castle Gresley Swadlincote, have now hit back over the way the incident was handled. Little fighter: Liberty in hospital suffering from cancer at just nine months old . Furious: Liberty's parents are unhappy with the way their daughter's school handled their complaint . Mr Finn said: 'We strongly feel that the school, the board of governors and the education authority are trying to quietly sweep the matter under the carpet. 'The teacher wasn’t suspended while the investigation was carried out. 'We have been told the governors have looked into the matter and they reassure us that our child’s welfare is of paramount importance and that appropriate action has been taken. However, they have not told us what the action was. 'My wife and I have watched our daughter bravely battle cancer. We have seen her inspire thousands and thousands of people. 'We will not see her humiliated in public. We cannot let this matter go with just a warning.' Liberty was eight months old when she was diagnosed with optic chaism glioma - a tumour around her optical nerve which meant it could never be operated on due to its size and location. However, after nine months of chemotherapy, the tumour vanished, making Liberty the first person on record to beat such a tumour. Mr and Mrs Finn said they were horrified as their daughter and her twin sister, Destiny, told them what had happened. Mr Finn added: 'My daughter has been left with special needs after bravely fighting a brain tumour and was subjected to what I can only describe as an act of public humiliation. 'Liberty Rose was made to clean her own urine off the classroom floor and made to do this while still in her soiled clothes.' Inspiration: Liberty-Rose Finn, left, with her twin sister Destiny during treatment for cancer at 18 months old. She was forced to stand by a wall for 10 minutes after wetting herself in class . Her parents are now appealing against the decision by the board of governors and have contacted Derbyshire County Council. However, a spokesman for the education authority said: 'We are not going to investigate the matter. 'We have spoken to the acting head teacher, and the school has apologised to the parents and has taken action to make sure it doesn’t happen again.' The teacher involved has been the subject of criticism on the social network site Facebook.","Liberty Rose Finn's battle with cancer left her with disabilities which causes her to often wet herself .

Vladimir Putin has branded America a nation which 'wants to control everything' during a scathing verbal attack on the U.S. The Russian Premier said the USA is seeking to dominate the world and interfere with the internal matters of other countries. Mr Putin also said America was being 'uncooperative' with Europe and Russia over Washington plans for a missile defence system. Attack: Mr Putin, pictured today chairing a Cabinet meeting in Moscow, said he thinks they 'sometimes do not want allies' Speaking during a Russian election campaign stopover in Siberia, Mr Putin said: 'They want to control everything. 'Sometimes I have the impression that the United States does not want allies, and instead that it needs vassals.' His outspoken criticism of the US 'foreign policy doctrine' came ahead of a demand for tougher controls on foreigners flouting immigration rules in Russia. Both blasts are seen as the strongman seeking to bolster his core support in the face of opposition rallies calling on him to quit. He remains the clear favourite to grab back the job he left in 2008 as Kremlin president. Turning his sights on strains over Washington's plans for a missile defence system on the continent, he said: 'They are not prepared to co-operate on equal terms either with Europe or us. 'Co-operation on equal terms means determining threats together and working out a system of response to them together. They flatly reject that.' Outspoken: Mr Putin, pictured in Siberia today, said America wants to 'dominate everything' Mr Putin also shared strong views on foreigners who are flouting immigration rules in Russia . He sneered at US tactics in seeking to influence other countries by arguing 'that you do not meet certain standards. 'They work out these standards themselves.' He warned against Western countries seeking to hold sway in Russia by funding organisations with political missions. 'This just not be allowed to happen,' he said. But he vowed to listen to protesters who accused him of vote rigging and leading a corrupt government. 'The authorities must respond and listen, no matter what they say and how abusive their language may be. It's indecent, but all the same we must listen to them,' he said. However, he vowed to prevent foreign governments exploiting the opposition for 'their own foreign policy goals with regard to our country'. Putin yesterday proposed a crackdown on immigration for those flouting rules. He has also called for migrants to pass language, history and law tests . And he promised to punish people running 'slave labour' rackets in Russia.","Russian Premier brands America 'uncooperative'

Last year's iPhone 4S (pictured) was a modest update for Apple's flagship smartphone - but insiders at Apple's factories say that a new handset will offer a bigger screen and different form factor . Sources inside Apple's Chinese supplier Foxconn have said that a new iPhone will have a four inch - or larger - screen. Several samples of the device are already under test, says the 'reliable' source, speaking to Apple blog 9to5Mac. The rumour would lend credibility to the idea that Apple is plotting a summer launch for its new handset. If the company is at the prototype stage already, launch could be very soon. The final model has not been selected, but all of them are significantly different from the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S. None have the 'teardrop' shape that some Apple-watchers predicted for the new model. 'The source said various sample devices are also floating around - they vary slightly from one another - so it is impossible to tell which one will be the final,' said 9to5Mac. The four-inch screen has been one of the most persistent rumours about Apple's upcoming smartphone - and would make sense, as it would take Apple's flagship device into line with rivals such as Samsung's Galaxy S2. The relatively modest update last year from iPhone 4 to iPhone 4S means that most Apple-watchers agree that a new model is inevitable - and many point to this summer for a likely launch date. The upcoming 'redesign' of Apple's iPhone was rumoured to have been personally overseen by late CEO Steve Jobs . Sources inside Apple accessory companies also say that iPad 3 will not be an overhaul of the product, with cases and other accessories at the same size as ones for iPad 2. That would leave the stage clear for a 'big' overhaul of iPhone this summer. At an earnings call this week, chief executive Tim Cook, who . replaced Apple founder Steve Jobs hinted at future gadgets, which are rumoured to . include a March release of the iPad 3 and a possible iPhone update.

A corrupt vicar who conducted 28 sham weddings was jailed yesterday. The Rev Canon Dr John Magumba, 58, pocketed at least £8,300 after he  agreed to marry Nigerians to Eastern Europeans living in Britain. The unions enabled the Africans to stay in the UK and claim hundreds of thousands of pounds in benefits. A court heard that the cost to the  taxpayer of one immigrant wrongly  entitled to services amounted to  £100,000 over a decade, or £230,000 if they had a child. Yesterday the Church of England vicar – who came to Britain from Uganda with his wife and six children – was told that he had brought scandal to his church as he was sentenced to two-and-a-half  years in jail. Investigators suspect no ceremony actually took place with the ‘couples’ simply given their marriage certificates – dubbed ‘golden tickets’ – after handing him hundreds of pounds. On one occasion he married the same woman to different men twice in the space of a week, later changing her age in the register to try to avoid suspicion. Ill-gotten gains: The vicar pocketed at least £8,300 from carrying out bogus weddings at churches including St Luke's in Deeplish, pictured . So many foreign couples tied the knot at . his churches that the local diocese made him head of a committee aimed . at detecting sham marriages – unaware that he was the main offender. Magumba claimed to have conducted his first sham wedding out of . compassion because he had been told the bride  was HIV positive and . urgently needed NHS treatment. One Nigerian woman took part  in ceremonies seven days apart,  prompting . a church official to demand why she had married two men in the space of . a week. ‘He said they were twins, and in some African countries twins were given . the same name,’ Joanna Rodikis, prosecuting, told Bolton Crown Court. Magumba then tried to cover his tracks by crudely altering her age in one of the entries from 28 to 38. Police became suspicious when they were alerted to the surge in the . number of weddings at one of his churches, St Peter’s in Newbold, . Rochdale. Fakes: Magumba also staged sham weddings at nearby St Peter's Newbold Church in Rochdale, Greater Manchester . There had been no weddings at all at the church between 1996 and 2007, . but in the four years after he took over there had been 21. Yet none of the fees he charged – at least £250 per ceremony – had made it into church accounts. The vicar is even suspected of pocketing money from funerals, none of which reached church funds. Magumba admitted conspiracy to facilitate a breach of UK immigration law as well as two counts of theft. His barrister, Hunter Gray, said: ‘He has spectacularly fallen from grace. ‘One day in prison is going to be too much for him.’ Dodgy papers: Magumba wrote out wedding banns for the fake marriages without even holding ceremonies .

A principal who described himself as a ‘Renaissance Man’ was found dead in his home Monday night. Barry Bowe, 54, was fearful that he would be dismissed from his job amid an ongoing investigation from the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school district over a security incident at a school dance in December. Only days before, parents at Northwest School of the Arts had launched a collective effort for him to be able to keep his post. The news of his death shocked students of the Charleston, North Carolina school, who said he was genuinely concerned with their educations and futures. Dr Bowe had requested a personal day Friday, but was supposed to be at work by Monday morning. A Charlotte-Mecklenburg school employee went to his house to check on him, calling the police after Dr Bowe didn't answer his door. A neighbour, who was given a spare key, let police into Dr Bowe’s home, where they discovered his body in the garage. Huntersville Police told WBTV that they believe the principal committed suicide by using carbon monoxide fumes from his car. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Tragic loss: Dr Bowe was found dead in the garage of his home; police believe he died of carbon monoxide poisoning . Cherished educator: Dr Bowe wrote: 'I love my talented ""kids."" I love that arts an am blessed to have help support good hard working students for many years' An automated phone message was sent out to faculty and students Monday night alerting them of his death. CMS Interim Superintendent Hugh Hattabaugh said the death of Dr Bowe was a ‘tragic loss.’ He said in a statement Tuesday: ‘Mr Bowe had been at Northwest School of the Arts since 2008 and was cherished by the students, staff and families at the school.’ Around 70 grief counsellors were at the school, assisting students and staff to cope with the tragedy. A stricken community: Students and staff of Northwest School of the Arts said Dr Bowe was a genuine and caring educator . In memoriam: Students and staff painted a rock outside the school black . According to school officials, Dr Bowe was under investigation for the way he handled an incident at a school dance in last month. A gun was reportedly found at event, which reportedly only had three faculty members serving as security. WCNC reports that Dr Bowe was supposed to show up for a meeting with the administration over the December 17 incident. But he never showed up. That's when CMS workers discovered that he was dead. One angry parent said the principal was given an ultimatum by the school board: either resign or be fired. Others were demanding answers about Dr Bowe’s ‘forced resignation, though CMS said the investigation was on-going and no punishment had yet been administered. Many parents, however, thought the incident was a way to oust Dr Bowe, WBTV reports. Students painted a large rock outside the school’s campus black in memory of their beloved principal. A fighter for the arts: The obituary in the Charlotte Observer described Dr Bowe as a journalist and artist . Another parent reflected on the positive influence Dr Bowe brought to the school. ‘He was such a wonderful educator and a wonderful man and he did wonders for this school,’ parent Lisa Muller told the station. One angry parent said the principal was given an ultimatum: either resign or be fired. In 2010, Dr Bowe wrote on his Facebook page how much he enjoyed his job at the North Carolina school. He said: 'Northwest School of the Arts is the perfect job match for me. 'We have a great photography program as well as theater, dance, music, and all of the visual arts. 'I love my talented ""kids."" I love that arts an am blessed to have help support good hard working students for many years.' While the district hasn’t disclosed much information regarding Dr Bowe’s employment, they said that he was not being forced to resign. Dr Bowe founded an arts festival in West Virginia, and was a ‘perfect fit’ for the West Virginia arts school, one CMS administrator said. Bowe began teaching in 1979 at East Bank High School in West Virginia. In 2000, he won Principal of the Year award. His obituary in the Charlotte Observer said: ‘He was a computer geek, a journalist, and he enjoyed working with special needs students. But at heart, he was an artist.’","Dr Barry Bowe, 54, was afraid for his job after a gun was reportedly found at a dance, parents said .

One day, they claimed, a chandelier suddenly started swinging on its own, which understandably left the burly builders feeling slightly unsettled. But it was only when one of the team took a photograph of the building that they suddenly became convinced they had not been working alone. Bizarre: Builders took this picture of a guest house they were demolishing and noticed this ghost-like figure. David Grimshaw is certain that it is his mother Frances, who worked at the guest house . Back from the dead: Frances Grimshaw worked at Meadowbank House. Her son believes she may have appeared to protest at the demolition of the building . The image appears to show the ghostly outline of a woman at the window of Meadowbank House, in Kendal, Cumbria. After researching the history of the building they realised the chilling . significance of what they’d photographed. The ghostly image was an eerie likeness of Frances Grimshaw who worked at the guest house and died almost a year ago. Bizarrely, she stood for hours at that very same window taking bookings. Her son, and former resident David Grimshaw, says he had no doubt that the ghostly woman is his late mother. He believes she may have appeared to protest at the demolition of Meadowbank House, the building she loved. 'That is my mother. I’m totally convinced - no one else looks like that. 'She had glasses and big earrings and she used to wear a dress with a bow at the front,' he said. 'She used to stand in that room for hours on the phone - it was the guest house reception and she took bookings from there.' Mr Grimshaw, a 59-year-old managing director, who now lives in Bedford, added: 'She would have been horrified if she had known the house was being demolished because it was beautiful, so maybe that is why she’s turned up.' Demolition supervisor Robert Johnson, 38, of Heysham, took the photograph of the house shortly before it was knocked down, earlier this week. 'It wasn’t until I got home and showed my wife that we spotted the woman,' he said. 'You can see the jewellery on her and everything. I’ve always been a sceptic but I’ll have to believe in ghosts now.' Colleague Stuart Shan, 34, from Blackburn, Lancashire, said: 'The day before we took the photo we were stripping the building inside and I noticed the chandelier swinging on its own. 'We said at the time the place felt strange. 'My hairs were standing on end when I saw the photo. I believe it is a ghost.' Left feeling strange: Demolition worker Robert Johnson with Stuart Shan, right, and . Paul Jackson,left. Mr Johnson took the picture of the house which revealed the ghostly image . Demolition worker Paul Jackson, of Carnforth, Lancashire, said the ghostly sighting made him feel slightly strange about their role in taking down old buildings. 'It makes you wonder what we could possibly unearth,' he said. Dave Armstrong, of Kendal contractors Cox and Allen, said the five-gabled building, which was originally a dentist’s in the early 1900s, has been taken down to be replaced with a new commercial property. He said he could not explain the image of the woman. 'There was only a black wall behind the window, we had taken everything out - there were no visible features or anything with a skin colour.'

A former Metropolitan Police chief has given evidence at a French inquiry into the death of Princess Diana to answer allegations that he suppressed evidence in the investigation into the crash that killed her. Lord Paul Condon, the Met's commissioner between 1993 and 2000, said he - along with former assistant commissioner Sir David Veness - voluntarily offered to provide witness evidence to the French Juge d'Instruction. The pair have long faced accusations from former Harrods boss Mohamed al Fayed, whose son Dodi also died in the August 1997 Paris crash, that they deliberately withheld evidence from the French investigation into their deaths. Both men went to the inquiry to explain why they failed to disclose the existence of a note in which Diana predicted her own death. Lord Condon said: 'Sir David and I volunteered to go to Paris as witnesses to help the French authorities explore and then bring to a conclusion these repeated complaints made by Mr al Fayed. 'We trust that our evidence was helpful, and we both sincerely hope that for all concerned, including Mr al Fayed, some closure can be finally brought to this tragic case.' In 2009 a French inquiry into the investigation into Diana’s death heavily criticised the French authorities and the French state was ordered to pay almost £5,000 in compensation to Mr al Fayed. Judges found there were problems in establishing that Henri Paul, the couple’s chauffeur who also died, was drunk at the time of the accident and a mix-up with his post-mortem examination and blood tests created unnecessary delays. The new French inquiry is being led by Judge Gerard Caddeo, Mr al Fayed said. Mr al Fayed’s claims that evidence was withheld centre around a letter - dubbed the Mishcon note - which was written by Diana’s divorce lawyer Lord Mishcon after an October 1995 meeting outlining her fears that there was a plot to kill her in a car crash. Witnesses: Both Lord Condon (left) and Sir David Veness (right) said they hoped their evidence would help bring about some closure of the case .

Veness are the beginning of a thorough investigation by the French . authorities into why Lord Mishcon’s letter was not provided to the . initial French inquiry. 'As . the father of Dodi and a good friend of the princess, I trust that the . outcome of these French investigations will be that those who are guilty . will be properly punished.' Lord Mishcon passed on the letter to police in confidence following a meeting with Lord Condon after the Princess’s death. Diana's former butler, Paul Burrell, produced a note from the princess making very similar allegations . It . was only when Diana’s former butler, Paul Burrell, produced a note from . the princess making very similar allegations in the Daily Mirror in . October 2003 that the police agreed to hand the letter over and that . December it was sent to the coroner investigating the princess’s death. 'Removing or concealing evidence' which could 'facilitate the discovery of a crime' is punishable by up to five years in France. Mr al Fayed has always said he believed there had been a cover up. A source close to the French inquiry told The Express: 'Mr al Fayed has always maintained that the evidence of Lord Mishcon has been concealed from the British coroner and the French authorities. 'It is his belief that the police  officers sat on it for six years until they were forced to disclose it following the revelations of Diana's butler Paul Burrell. 'Ever since the evidence of the note was revealed by Mr al Fayed has pressed the French authorities to investigate those responsible for its suppression.' At the UK inquest into the deaths, Mr al Fayed implicated many establishment figures in the plot to kill or cover up the murder of the couple.","Lord Condon and Sir David Veness voluntarily go to France to be witnesses .

Passenger satisfaction with Britain’s rip-off railways is plummeting as inflation-busting fares soar, a report by watchdogs revealed yesterday. Less than half of rail users believe they get value for money – significantly down on a year ago – dropping to nearly a quarter on the worst-performing routes. Passengers, recently hit with fare rises of up to 11 per cent, expressed increasing dissatisfaction with the soaring cost of tickets, poor punctuality, overcrowding, and rail operators’ inability to deal with delays. Overcrowded and late: Less than half of passengers believe they get value for money from Britain's rip-off railways . The rail consumer watchdog Passenger Focus, which surveyed 30,590 travellers last autumn for its annual study, found massive differences in customer satisfaction levels depending on the area in which they were travelling. Overall, 46 per cent of all passengers are satisfied with the value for money of their ticket, compared with 49 per cent last year. But this slumped even further with specific train operators and routes. National Express East Anglia gave the least ‘value for money’ satisfaction (33 per cent), followed by Southeastern (36), Heathrow Express (37), South West Trains (38) and First Capital Connect (38). The worst-performing route for value for money was the Stansted Express airport link into London Liverpool Street station (27 per cent satisfaction). The next worst was the National Express East Anglia mainline service to Ipswich and surroundings (28), followed by the National Express West Anglia route to King’s Lynn via Cambridge (30) and  South West Trains’ routes around Surrey and Hampshire (32). Michael Roberts, of the Association of Train Operating Companies, said: ‘We recognise value for money scores remain lower than others and the whole industry needs to focus on tackling costs as well as improving services.’ But he blamed government policy for soaring fares. ‘Successive governments have pursued above-inflation fare rises to reduce taxpayer subsidy while ensuring ongoing investment in the railways,’ he said.","National Express East Anglia had lowest overall satisfaction rating of train companies .

Argentina's president wasted little time in  launching a new attack in Britain over the Falkland Islands after returning to work following a cancer scare. Cristina Fernandez showed off the deep scar from an operation to remove her thyroid after what proved to be a false cancer diagnosis, during a broadcast to the nation. She then turned on British Prime Minister David Cameron, who angered Argentines while she was away by accusing them of having ‘colonialist’ attitudes toward the Falklands. During the speech, she said: ‘I heard they're calling us colonialist. ... One is always tempted to respond, but I think it's better to avoid it. When they say these things it's exactly because they don't have reasons or arguments.’ Joke: President Cristina Fernandez makes light of her recent health scare as she shows off a deep wound on her neck . Scarred: The deep wound from surgery on her thyroid is clearly visible . Argentina has called on Britain to negotiate the sovereignty of the remote South Atlantic archipelago it calls the Malvinas. Britain has maintained a military presence there since liberating the islands in 1982 from an ill-fated Argentine attempt to take them back. Some British analysts have accused Argentines of saber-rattling as the 30th anniversary of that war nears, but Fernandez has insisted on a peaceful resolution. She took another step, announcing that she's making public the ‘Rattenbach Report,’ a long-secret analysis of Argentine leadership failures that called the war a ‘military adventure’ and recommended criminal penalties for those responsible. The report was prepared in 1982, just before the end of Argentina's dictatorship, but was kept classified to keep anyone from being punished. Fernandez sought to draw a clear line between what she called the militarism of other governments and the democracy she leads. Pro-government protesters mount a forceful display outside the British Embassy as tensions rise over the Falkland Islands . ‘Next year will mark 180 years since the usurpation by the government of United Kingdom, which threw out the Argentines who were there (on the islands). They want to make us out to be the bad and violent little ones, something we're not,’ she said. Twice in recent days, pro-government . protesters have been pushed back by riot police from the British Embassy . in Buenos Aires, chanting and carrying signs demanding that Britain . turn over the islands. Falklanders have responded that they have nothing . in common with the Argentines. Protection: Police guard the British Embassy because of growing desire to claim the Falkland Islands .

Fernandez's last public appearance had . been December 28, the day after her office announced the cancer diagnosis. Doctors removed the entire gland January 4 after discovering several more . lumps during surgery. Tests then showed the growths were benign. She said: ‘I was going to come with a . handkerchief because it doesn't look very aesthetic,’ she said, . referring to a deep horizontal crease just above her collarbone that . appears to have healed nicely during her 20-day medical leave. But I thought, if I cover it up with a handkerchief, tomorrow Clarin will say, 'This woman wasn't operated on,’ she joked. ‘You all know that aesthetics are very important to me, but I told myself, 'Sweetie, politics before style.’' Questions raised by the newspaper Clarin and other opposition media about her diagnosis and operation had prompted Fernandez to release her medical records, reinforcing what her doctors.","'It doesn't look very aesthetic' president jokes about scar .

It is the latest in a series of lucrative agreements struck by Bob Crow’s RMT union which have been described as ‘ransom payments’ to prevent chaos on public transport during the Games. And it will antagonise taxpayers who learned yesterday that the cost of the Olympics has soared. When Britain won the bid to host the Games, in 2005, ministers said it would cost £2.37billion. The Coalition has since budgeted £9.3billion to cover venues, policing and security. 'Bragging': Bob Crow, the RMT Union's General Secretary . But hundreds of ‘hidden’ costs mean the true bill could be between £2.4billion and £14billion more than this, according to a Sky News investigation. These costs include land purchases, anti-terrorism funding and transport improvements. Bonuses to stop London Underground staff striking, converting venues for public use after the Games, employing anti-doping officers and investing in tourism also add to the cost. The TaxPayers’ Alliance called on the Government to stop ‘merrily writing cheques’ and remember the millions of ordinary families ‘paying for this event’. Last night, Greg Knight, Tory MP for East Yorkshire, said: ‘This is grotesque. Many people will have to work overtime during the Olympics but they do not get huge payments. ‘Just because the word “Olympics” has been mentioned does not been they should be handed more money.’ And Dominic Raab, Tory MP for Esher and Walton, said: ‘Yet again Bob Crow’s brinkmanship means taxpayers coughing up to pay rail staff bonuses just for doing their job. Let the Games commence: The deal would cover a period of almost nine weeks during the Olympics and Paralympics . ‘This deal shows how out of touch the militant unions are with the reality of the straitened times everyone else faces.’ But Mr Crow, the RMT’s general secretary, said: ‘This is a truly groundbreaking deal, raising the bar in the industry and putting £2,500 in our members’ pockets as a reward for the extra workload and pressure they will carry.’ Serco Docklands, which operates the DLR trains on behalf of Transport for London, said that the deal was ‘fair’ and reflected the extra hours that staff would be asked to work and ‘restrictions to their annual leave’ during that time. The DLR has no drivers, but on-board ‘captains’ responsible for passenger safety are paid an average of £36,000. They are usually paid 50 per cent extra on their normal shift rate for overtime, but this will rise to 75 per cent during the Games. Last night it was unclear which public body would pay. TfL said it would bill the Olympic Delivery Authority for the overtime, but an ODA spokesman said it would only ‘reimburse TfL for normal overtime payments’ incurred during the Olympics and not bonus payments. Tube drivers will be paid up to £1,200 extra for working changed and longer duties during the Olympics. They are also in talks with TfL over a separate bonus.  Train drivers working for London Overground are getting a £500 bonus. A spokesman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport denied that the overall cost of the Games would hit £24billion. ‘The Public Sector Funding Package for the Games is £9.3billion and includes all additional security, defence and public transport provision,’ the spokesman said. ‘It is simply not right to start adding budgets that would have been in existence regardless of 2012 and claim that as being an Olympic cost.’","Workers on driver-less DLR network offered 25 per cent overtime increase during the 2012 games .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Last updated at 12:50 PM on 25th January 2012 . Signed off: Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa has approved a law forcing porn stars to wear condoms while filming in the city . A controversial new law forcing porn stars to wear condoms during film shoots in Los Angeles will come into effect in the next six weeks after being rubber-stamped by the city's mayor. The law, signed on Monday by Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, will come into force 41 days after it is posted by the city clerk, expected to happen as early as this week. Officials with the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which lobbied for years for such a law, expressed jubilation yesterday and said they would now turn their attention to getting a similar condom requirement adopted elsewhere. Michael Weinstein, president of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which had pushed the measure for six years, said: 'The city of Los Angeles has done the right thing. They've done the right thing for the performers.' But critics claim the regulation jeopardises the long-term future of the industry in the nation's porn capital as many firms have threatened to abandon the area. Mr Weinstein said its adoption is crucial in protecting adult film actors from HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. Weinstein said his group's next move will be to get Los Angeles County to adopt a similar measure for its unincorporated areas. The group is in the midst of a petition drive to put the issue on the ballot, but Weinstein said he hopes the county's Board of Supervisors will react as the Los Angeles City Council did and pass such an ordinance itself. The council gave its final approval last week. Exodus? Industry bosses have threatened to leave the city over the condom law, but proponents want to encourage similar legislation elsewhere in U.S. Industry officials estimate as many as 90 per cent of the porn films produced in the United States are made in Los Angeles. Most are filmed quietly in the city's suburban San Fernando Valley. Legendary porn king Ron Jeremy believes viewers would be put off by condoms because they 'ruin the fantasy' and said many customers would simply seek out overseas imports which often don't use protection. The 58-year-old claims the current method of carrying out STD testing on actors every 30 days was a sufficient safeguard against HIV. Critic: Legendary porn actor Ron Jeremy (above) claims the use of condoms would 'ruin the fantasy' for viewers . But fellow veteran actor Darren James welcomed the new law as a means of giving further protection to workers. 'I’m happy he (the mayor) signed it,' Mr James told the New York Daily News. 'We’re just trying to protect people’s lives. We’re still human beings even though we chose to be in this business.' According to the NY Daily News, Mr James, 47, was the focus of an HIV outbreak which closed production in the area for a month in 2004 when he unwittingly spread the disease to three actresses after testing negative just a few days earlier. After the council's action, several of the industry's biggest filmmakers said they might consider moving just outside the county. That prompted Simi Valley Mayor Bob Huber to announce last week that he would ask the city attorney for his community, located just across the county line from the San Fernando Valley, to write a similar ordinance. Weinstein said Tuesday his group would also be vigilant in keeping track of where porn producers might go. Exactly how the law will be enforced is still to be determined. It calls for makers of porn films to pay a fee, the amount still to be determined, that would be used to pay for spot checks at filming locations. Health risk: It is hoped the new legislation will safeguard against STDs in the industry, but opponents believe the current method of testing every 30 days is sufficient . The City Council is creating a committee to determine the amount of the fee and who would make the spot checks. Weinstein said he envisions enforcement would fall on nurses or other public health providers. 'It is not anticipated, based on what we desire or what has been discussed, that it would be uniformed police officers,' he said. Weinstein said he would be open to working with industry leaders to enforce the law. He noted the ordinance does not require condoms when oral sex is involved because his group, which originally crafted it, agreed with the filmmakers that infection through oral sex was not as great as through other sex acts. The industry already requires that actors be tested for HIV every 30 days, and filmmakers say they believe that is sufficient. 'It's not that I don't doubt the sincerity of their desire to protect the talent. And believe it or not, we have the same ambition,' Christian Mann, general manager of Evil Angel Productions, said last week after the council's vote. 'We just don't believe their way is the best way,' added Mann, who is also on the board of directors of the industry trade group the Free Speech Coalition.","Mayor signs law to safeguard against STDs .

Newt Gingrich's fond recollections of working under Ronald Reagan in the 1980s have been rubbished by a White House colleague who claims he was often extremely critical of the former president. In several of his campaign speeches, Gingrich has alluded to his work with the 40th U.S. President, claiming 'we helped defeat the Soviet empire' and 'I helped Reagan create millions of jobs' among other achievements. But Elliott Abrams, a former assistant secretary of state, said that rather than working side by side with Reagan, Gingrich was scathing about his plans to defeat Communism and often refused to support his decisions. Not eye to eye: Newt Gingrich repeatedly insulted and disagreed with President Reagan, especially over his policy towards Soviet Russia, and insider has revealed . Claims: Former assistant secretary of state Elliott Abrams said Gingrich was often critical of Reagan's presidency and policies . Mr Abrams said that when Gingrich was first elected to Congress in 1978, the freshman members chose to attack Reagan as often as he voted for him. Writing in the National Review, he describes a statement made by Gingrich on March 21, 1986, at the height of the Nicaraguan contras funding debate. He quotes Gingrich: 'Measured against the scale and momentum of the Soviet empire's challenge, the Reagan administration has failed, is failing, and without a dramatic change in strategy will continue to fail... President Reagan is clearly failing. 'The burden of this failure frankly must be placed first on Ronald Reagan.' In another bitter attack, he compared . Reagan's meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev as 'the most . dangerous summit for the West since Adolf Hitler met with Neville . Chamberlain in 1938 in Munich'. He also criticised Reagan's delivery in speeches and claimed his policies towards the USSR were 'pathetic' and 'incompetent'. Ultimately, Reagan's stance on the Soviet empire proved correct as the USSR collapsed in 1991. Gingrich . reacted similarly to George W. Bush when he was making a decision on . the surge in Iraq and facing opposition from top generals and other . Republicans in 2008. Critical: Gingrich, 69, pictured with his wife Callista, has used recollections of his time working under Reagan during his speeches . Main rival? Republican hopeful Mitt Romney at Miami-Dade College. The pair are neck-and-neck in polls in Florida ahead of the fourth primary on Tuesday . It comes after it emerged Gingrich and rival Mitt Romney are neck and neck in the fight for Florida. Public . opinion polls have now put the two Republicans in a close contest and . the winner of Tuesday's primary will be the first to claim a second . victory in the race for the nomination. The first three nominating contests, in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, have gone to three different candidates. Gingrich, . a former House speaker, has tried to paint Romney as out-of-touch by . highlighting bank accounts in Switzerland and the Cayman Islands. Flashback: Reagan is pictured with Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987 as they sign the START treaty. Gingrich compared their first meeting to that of Adolf Hitler and Neville Chamberlain in 1938 . Trailing: Rick Santorum and, right, Ron Paul, have very little presence in Florida and neither is expected to gain much support in the next primary . The 69-year-old himself has faced criticism over his remarks on President Bill Clinton's infidelity in the mid-1990s, at the same time as he was involved in an affair. Rick Santorum, who won the first primary in Iowa, stands virtually no chance of winning the Florida caucus and has not planned any advertising in the state as he focuses on the Midwest.

"By . Lee Moran . Last updated at 8:55 AM on 25th January 2012 . Libya's ramshackle government lost control of a former Gaddafi stronghold today after locals staged an armed uprising. Forces loyal to ousted, and now dead, leader Muammar Gaddafi seized control of Bani Walid and then raised in celebration the deposed regime's green flag on hundreds of buildings. The re-taking of the town, which saw elders driven out in a lengthy bloody gunbattle which killed four people and left 25 others wounded, raises the spectre that the country will descend into civil war. Celebration: A photo, reportedly from Bani Walid which appeared on a Libyan website, shows a green flag being raised as Gaddafi loyalists re-captured the town . Dumped: A damaged tank lies abandoned in a street following the gunbattle which left four people dead and 25 others wounded . The return of violence to the oil-rich . North African nation will also be met with a rolling of the eyes in . Washington and London, who both spent billions in pushing Gaddafi out. This . week's bloodshed in Bani Walid poses the gravest challenge yet to the . country's new rulers - the National Transitional Council. A . local resident said yesterday's battles began when members of the May . 28 militia, affiliated to the NTC, arrested some former Gaddafi . loyalists. That prompted other supporters of the former leader to attack the militia's garrison. Mubarak al-Fatamni, the head of Bani . Walid local council, fled to the nearby city of Misrata following the . attack, which witnesses said was fought using heavy weaponry. Aftermath: The barracks of the May 28 brigade - fighters loyal to the . National Transiitional Council - was left riddled with bullet holes after the firefight . Captured: Photos, reportedly taken in Bani Walid, show the flags that represent the presence of supporters of the ousted regime . A . top commander of a revolutionary brigade in Bani Walid, Ali al-Fatamni, . who was present in Benghazi during the attack, said he had lost contact . with other fighters in the town. The . NTC still has the backing of the NATO powers who, with their diplomatic . pressure and bombing campaign, helped push out Gaddafi and install the . new government. NTC . authorities pledged to unify the tribally-divided country, reconstruct . its once mighty oil industry that made Libya a major exporter in OPEC, . and hold democratic elections. But the town's revolt heightens doubts in the West about the NTC government's ability to instil law and order. This is seen as crucial to rebuilding . oil exports, to disarming tribal militias and guarding Libyan borders . in a region where Al Qaeda is active. Anger: Libyans damage the car of National Transitional Council Chairman Mustafa Abdel Jalil over the weekend . Demands: Among protesters in Benghazi are Islamists demanding Libya's rulers apply sharia law . The collapse of NTC authority in the . town, one of the most die-hard bastions of pro-Gaddafi sentiment during . Libya's nine-month civil war last year, could not come at a worse time. Growing . discontent about the NTC has spread across the country - with the . biggest demonstration taking place in Benghazi, the birthplace of last . year's uprising. Abdel Hafiz Ghoga, vice-president of the NTC, resigned on Monday after a series of violent protests in the eastern port city. Demonstrators, who claim many NTC . members are tarnished by ties to Gaddafi and failed to quickly restore . basic public services, smashed windows at the local headquarters on . Saturday night. And on . Thursday, crowds jostled Ghoga during a library visit as security staff . struggled to help him escape. Last night he said he was quitting to try . to limit the damage to the council. Discontent: Crowds break into the local NTC headquarters in Benghazi on Saturday . Occupation: Crowds demanded to speak NTC leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil after reaching the second floor . ‘My resignation is for the benefit of the nation and is required at this stage,’ Ghoga told Al Jazeera News. He said the national consensus that . helped the country rise up and end Gaddafi’s rule had not lasted into . peacetime, giving way instead to what he called an atmosphere of . ‘hatred.’ ‘I do . not want this atmosphere to continue and negatively affect the National . Transitional Council and its performance,’ said Ghoga, who also acted as . the NTC’s spokesman. He is one of the most senior of . Libya’s new rulers to have left office since Gaddafi’s overthrow in . August. His departure will revive doubts about the NTC’s ability to form . a cohesive and effective government. NTC chief Mustafa Abdel Jalil, speaking in Benghazi on Monday, appealed to the protesters to be more patient. Confusion: NTC deputy Abdel Hafiz Ghoga, left, . quit despite leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil saying he didn't . think his colleague would resign. Abdel Jalil warned the country was . descending into a 'bottomless pit' ‘We are going through a political movement that can take the country to a bottomless pit,’ he said. ‘There is something behind these protests that is not for the good of the country. ‘The people have not given the government enough time and the government does not have enough money. ‘Maybe there are delays, but the . government has only been working for two months. Give them a chance, at . least two months.’ In . a glimpse of the lack of co-ordination which Western diplomats say . pervades the workings of the NTC, Abdel Jalil was asked if Ghoga would . be stepping down and said he would not. The . organisation is also under increasing pressure to hand over Gaddafi’s . influential son Saif to the International Criminal Court in The Hague. Disturbing legacy: Many NTC members are said to . be tainted by former dictator Muammar Gaddafi, while his son Saif, . right, is the now the focus of international human rights groups over . the way he is being held . Despite his father’s regime’s brutal record, the case has become an unlikely rallying point for global human rights advocates. The NTC have been criticised for failing to tell him what he is charged with or give him access to a lawyer. Saif, who lost his right thumb and forefinger during the civil war, is also denied visitors, television, radio and the internet at his compound in Zintan, 100 miles from Tripoli. Libyan leaders insist the country will hold a trial. But Donatella Rovera, an Amnesty International official, said the NTC had failed to put in place a trial system with independent judges and skilled prosecutors.","Bani Walid now under control of Gaddafi loyalists .

A death row inmate sent a letter to a local North Carolina newspaper boasting about the 'life of leisure' he is living while waiting for his execution. 'Is the public aware that the chances of my lawful murder taking place in the next 20 years if ever are very slim?' Danny Robbie Hembree Jr. wrote in a letter from jail. Hembree, 50, was found guilty of killing a 17-year-old girl in 2009. Danny Robbie Hembree Jr. flaunted his life life in prison in a letter to a North Carolina newspaper . He also admitted in a police interrogation to killing two other women, though he now says that he was lying to distract authorities and cover up other crimes. 'Is the public aware that I am a gentleman of leisure, watching color TV in the a/c, reading, taking naps at will, eating three well-balanced meals a day? 'I am a man who is ready to except [sic] his unjust punishment and face God Almighty with a clear conscience unlike you cowards and your cowardly system. 'Kill me if you can, suckers. Ha! Ha! Ha! Hembree was sentenced to death on November 18 for the murder of Heather Catterton and has been waiting in Central Prison in Raleigh, North Carolina. 'I got a call from the father of the 17-year-old that he murdered, in tears,' District Attorney Locke Bell said. The big house: Hembree is waiting for his execution in Central Prison of Raleigh, North Carolina . Hembree (left) if accused of the murder of Heather Catterton (right) who was 17 at the time of her death . 'He said that this is tearing the family to shreds. This is ripping the wound open,' Mr Bell told ABC News. 'I laugh at you self righteous clowns and . I spit in the face of your so called justice system. The state of North . Carolina has sentenced me to death but it's not real,' -Danny Hembree . '(The father) said, ""He murdered our daughter, got the death penalty and now he's just sitting in jail laughing at us!""' In spite of Hembree's declarations of grandeur, the conditions of Central Prison have been under a microscope in recent months since the prison warden resigned after the despicable treatment of prisoners with mental illnesses. Alvin Keller stepped down in November- coincidentally the day after Hembree was sentenced- following the results of an investigation that showed mentally ill inmates being left unattended for weeks at a time and found in cells covered with human feces. The conditions in Hembree's cell seem much more luxurious, however, and he boasted about his free government health care in the letter. In the November sentencing where Hembree was convicted of murdering a 17-year-old girl, he blew his mother a kiss after being put on death row for the crime . I'm housed in a building that connects to the new 55 million dollar hospital with round the clock free medical care 24/7.' The gloating letter is not the only one that Hembree sent from prison which is due to be controversial. He also mailed an inflammatory letter to the NAACP attempting to goad them into fighting for one of his alleged victims, saying that the state’s justice system was playing racial favorites. In addition to Ms Catterton, Hembree is thought to have killed to other women- Randi Dean Saldana, 30, whose burnt remains were found in South Carolina in 2009 and Deborah Ratchford, 30, whose body found in 1992. Ms Saldana and Ms Catterton, who were friends and both had a history of drug arrests at the time of their death, were white and Ms Ratchford was black. His other alleged victims: Randi Saldana (left) had a 2-year-old child at the time of her death, and Deborah Ratchford (right) was killed in 1992 . Hembree wrote to the African-American civil rights group arguing that Mr Bell is trying the cases of the two white women first for racially-motivated reasons. ‘I implore your great organization to pressure Mr. Bell until he gives Debora Ratchford her day in court in the interest of justice,’ Hembree’s letter said. Both of his letters display a flagrant disregard for the victims families and his lack of remorse. 'I laugh at you self righteous clowns and I spit in the face of your so called justice system. The state of North Carolina has sentenced me to death but it's not real,' he wrote in the letter to the Gaston Gazette. Central Prison . Central Prison was the first to be built in North Carolina, and was established in December 1884. It was built by inmates themselves and took 14 years to construct. Though it originally cost $1.25million to build, construction costs have gone up over the past century, and a major renovation in the 1980s cost $28.8million. The prison holds 1000 inmates and provides work for the 700 members of staff. Central Prison serves as the state's main execution chamber and houses all inmates on death row. On a lighter note, it has Bible study classes, team sports and job assignments within in the prison for 260 prisoners. Inmates can even take college correspondence courses through the prestigious University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which was most recently ranked number 29 in the country.","Danny Hembree, 50, on death row for murder of a 17-year-old girl but also considered the main suspect in the murders of two other women .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 5:27 PM on 19th January 2012 . It may look like the lovechild of a garden shed and an exclusive 1920s Rolls Royce but this little beauty is expected to raise an incredible £250,000 when it goes on sale. Don't be fooled by the odd and rather strange looking appearance, this rare 1928 Rolls Royce Phantom is thought to be the world's first estate car and therefore has a starring role in automotive history. The roller was transformed into a troop-carrying motor to assist in the war effort after engineers removed the roof and rear half of the bodywork. The Spirit of .. Practicality: This unusual pre-war Rolls Royce is an . historic milestone in automotive development worth £250,000. It is . claimed to be the world's first estate car . They then welded on the wooden section to the original chasis creating a large carriage in the back. All that newly created space allowed the military to ferry personnel around during World War 2. And as a result of the refit the vintage car was given the name 'Shooting Brake' and became the forerunner to estate-loving marques like Volvo. This Rolls Royce Phantom 1 Shooting Brake is currently owned by a wealthy Dutch car collector who has decided it is time to move it on to a new home. Rare design: The 1928 Phantom limousine was commandeered as part of the . war effort and adapted to carry RAF ground crew around airfields during . Britain's darkest days . The car will go under the hammer at auction house Bonhams Paris automobile sale and due to its unusual design and historical interest is expected to sell for hundreds of thousands of pounds. Robert Glover, a specialist in vintage cars at Bonhams, said: 'Shooting Brakes were very popular in the fifties and sixties and were the first type of estate cars. 'If you had an old Rolls Royce then it probably looked a bit tired and worn out but mechanically it would have been fine. 'Rather than just scrap it, people would lop off the back half and replace it with a wooden construction. 'The chasis, wheels, engine, bonnet and wings would have remained the same. 'They were ideal for carrying hunting . or coach parties across country estates which is why estate cars of . today are called estate cars. 'The Shooting Brake for sale was one of the first to undergo the unusual change.

"By . Rob Waugh . Last updated at 4:15 PM on 26th January 2012 . Presidential hopeful Newt Gingrich has promised to return to the glory days of the U.S. space programme and establish a permanent base on the moon by 2020... if he's elected president. The former House speaker told a Florida audience he wanted to develop a commercial space industry similar to the airline boom of the 1930s. And channeling the spirit of JFK - who threw his support behind the space programme to ensure the U.S. was first to land a man on the moon in 1969 - he insisted Russia and now China must 'not come close' to beating American space exploration. On a different planet? Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich greets people during a meeting in Cocoa, Florida where he claimed he would put a permanent base on the moon by 2020 if elected . Gingrich, the former House speaker, said that he wanted to develop a robust commercial space industry in line with the airline boom of the 1930s, leading to a permanent base on the moon . Nasa already has highly detailed plans for a proposed lunar outpost - following a plan put foward under George W. Bush. Rocket landers will shuttle astronauts back and forth as they build a permanent base. Minibus-sized vehicles will allow astronauts to navigate, while spider-like robots will help lift gear. The astronauts will live in pressurised rooms. 'Week long visits to the lunar surface will be followed by increasingly longer stays as the outpost takes shape,' says the agency. 'The Altair lunar lander will be capable of landing four astronauts on the moon, and returning the crew to the Orion spacecraft that will bring them home to Earth.' In front of a crowd of around 2,000 people at a hotel in Cocoa, Florida, he said: 'This will be the second great launch of the adventure John F. Kennedy started. 'I grew up with a romantic belief that space is our destiny.' Gingrich said he wanted a competitive space programme based on 'prize money' incentives, with multiple launches possible at a time 'like an airport'. A long-time space enthusiast, the 69-year-old also said he wanted to expand exploration of Mars, saying NASA could pay for ambitious plans by teaming up with the private sector. The plans are a vote-winner in Florida, a region well known for the Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral Air Force Base but one that is still suffering from a round of federal cuts to the space programme last year. The idea of a moon base was an element of George W. Bush's policy and Nasa has detailed plans for a base which was to be constructed by 2024. Those plans were cancelled by Barack Obama's administration. But it is largely JFK who remembered for pushing funding to allow Neil Armstrong to become the first man to walk on the moon, despite initially being reticent about the space programme. After twice attempting to secure a joint deal with Soviet Russia, John F. Kennedy made the decision after Yuri Gargarin became the first man into space that America would have to win the race. Gingrich called the current state of the space programme 'a total mess, an embarrassment' at the Florida event. Nasa's conceptual designs for a planned 'lunar outpost': The agency says that vehicles carrying four astronauts would shuttle to and forth to the moon, building permanent structures . The Lunar Electric Rover is a small pressurized concept rover about the size of a pickup truck (with 12 wheels) and can house two astronauts for up to 14 days with sleeping and sanitary facilities . He said: 'By the end of my second term, we need to have the first permanent base on the moon, and it will be American. 'We will have commercial near-Earth . activities that include science, tourism and manufacturing and are . designed to create a robust industry precisely on the model of the . development of the airlines in the 1930s. 'Because it is in our interest to . acquire so much experience in space that we clearly have a capacity that . the Chinese and Russians will never come anywhere close to matching.' He said it would take $450billion to . get a man on Mars and called for 10 per cent of Nasa's budget to be set . aside to encourage competition. The Altair lunar lander will be capable of landing four astronauts on the moon, providing life support and a base for weeklong initial surface exploration missions, and returning the crew to the Orion spacecraft that will bring them home to Earth . Golden age: Astronaut Buzz Aldrin walks on the surface of the moon in 1969 . Responding to criticism that he was . being 'grandiose', Gingrich told the Washington Post: 'The Wright . Brothers standing at Kitty Hawk were grandiose. John F. Kennedy was . grandiose. 'I accept the charge that I am grandiose and that Americans are instinctively grandiose.' It comes as Gingrich and rival Mitt Romney neck-and-neck in polls in Florida ahead of the fourth Republican primary on Tuesday. Gingrich had been lagging behind, but has closed the gap on Romney after winning the primary in South Carolina.","Presidential hopeful promises permanent American base by 2020 .

No laughing matter: Rumer Willis looked distressed yesterday outside the Los Angeles hospital her mother Demi Moore was rushed to after collapsing following an alleged nitrous oxide binge . Rumer has been seen outside the hospital twice. On the second occasion she obscured her face with sunglasses. She has been desperately worried about her mother and has reportedly phoned Ashton, who is currently in Brazil, to ask for his help. A . source told Hollywoodlife.com: 'Rumer is devastated. She worries day . and night about her mother and has been watching her mom fall apart. 'Rumer actually reached out to Ashton on several occasions and he just . blew her off.

She added that Demi was 'convulsing' and 'semi-conscious, barely.' The caller said: 'She's been having some issues lately with some other stuff, but I don't know what she's been taking or not.' When asked by the operator if the apparent overdose was accidental or intentional, the caller said: 'Well, she smoked something but the reaction was accidental.' A second woman gets on the phone and says, 'She's shaking, convulsing, burning up. I'm taking cold water and putting it on her back because she's burning up.'At one point, the woman can be heard saying: 'Demi, can you hear me? Yes, she's squeezing my hand. She can't speak. She's convulsing so we're holding her down.' By the end of the call, a male caller takes the phone and says Demi is 'much calmer...she's breathing fine. She's leaning up and talking quietly.' Demi's eldest daughter Rumer, 23, is believed to have been at home at the time of the star's collapse. During the early stages of the 911 call, a female can be heard saying: 'What is the address Ru?'

"By . Ray Massey, Transport Editor and Emma Reynolds . Last updated at 5:39 PM on 25th January 2012 . Snaking queues formed on the forecourts today as petrol pumps began to run dry following the closure of one of the UK's largest refineries. Fearful motorists found themselves backed up in jams stretching out of petrol stations in the South East as pumps displayed signs warning that supplies had been drained. Drivers attempting to fill their tanks at Waitrose in Southend, Essex, were greeted by a message that diesel had run out. Chaos: Long queues formed at petrol station in the South East today - like this one at Waitrose in Southend, Essex - after Coryton refinery stopped trading . The chaos follows the closure yesterday of Coryton refinery in Essex, which supplies 10 per cent of the UK's fuel and a fifth of the petrol used in the South East. Fuel prices have risen again just 24 hours after the refinery's Swiss parent company Petroplus went bust and Coryton ceased supplies to filling stations. And petrol retailers and motoring groups have warned that more hikes are in the pipeline, adding: ‘The only way is up.’ Diesel rose to 142.32p ( from 142.21p) per litre – and is now within a fraction of 1p of a new record. Petrol rose to 134.03 (from 133.89p) per litre the previous day, the AA reported. The knock-on effects of action would have come too late to have an impact on the latest prices, but motoring groups have warned that ‘profiteering’ speculators will seize on the restricted supply to drive up the wholesale cost of petrol and diesel, pushing up prices to consumers at the pumps. Drained dry: A petrol pump displays a sign warning drivers that diesel has run out . It has sparked fears of ‘panic buying’ to avoid shortages and big price hikes. Coryton’s administrators Price Waterhouse Cooper (PwC) confirmed at lunchtime that no fuel supplies were leaving the refinery today – three days after they were stopped. But production is continuing with refined fuel being stored on site. Energy ministers insist the lost supplies are being made up from other refineries and from abroad and have urged motorists not to panic. Petrol retailers predict diesel prices in particular are set to soar by up to 3p to a new record £1.45 a litre. That would see a £100 fill-up for ‘Mondeo Man’ in a family saloon with a 70-litre tank. Record fuel prices were set in May last year when diesel hit 143.04p and petrol 137.43p. This time last year, petrol was 128.51p – around 5p per litre less than today and diesel 133.15p per litre – nearly 10p cheaper. Instability in Iran and their threat to blockade key oil tanker routes in the Straits of Hormuz the Gulf, coupled with the strong dollar, is also storing up trouble, retailers warned. Fears escalate: Retailers are worried about panic buying making shortages worse and forcing up prices further . AA president Edmund King said: ’There is no doubt that the loss of supplies from a major UK refinery, plus the problems in Iran, is going to give the speculators a field day. ‘When they speculate, the only way is up as far as  fuel prices are concerned. Motorists are going to have to get used to seeing petrol and diesel prices creeping up.‘It’s only a matter of time before the diesel record is broken.’ RMI Petrol’s Brian Madderson said shortages would push up the price of fuel as traders and speculators exploit the situation for profit. ‘I expect diesel to rise 3p a litre to a new record of £1.45 by the end of the month.The first impact will be a push through on wholesale prices.’ MPs and unions joined the chorus warning of shortages while forecourt bosses said there was a risk of parts of the South East ‘grinding to a halt’ after supplies from the Coryton refinery were suspended. Crisis looms: MPs and forecourt bosses warned parts of the South East could 'grind to a halt' amid reports production had stopped at the giant Coryton refinery in Essex, pictured . No petrol, diesel or other products, including bitumen for road building, were leaving the site today. The action came when the refinery’s owner ran out of cash and was unable to extend its credit facilities. PwC said it had no idea when supplies would resume but was ‘talking to customers’. The warnings came along with the threat to up to 1,000 UK jobs at the formerly BP-owned refinery. A separate strike by more than 80 tanker drivers at the South Killingholme refinery in Lincolnshire, which supplies around 340 Jet filling stations, is exacerbating supply concerns. But energy ministers and oil industry bosses said they were doing their best to make up the shortfall from the UK’s seven remaining refineries and by buying in from abroad. If today's rush to the pumps continues, however, filling stations could run dry. PwC said refining was continuing at . Coryton but supplies were being stored rather than being sent out. It . could not say when normal service would resume. Steven Pearson, joint administrator and PwC partner, said: ‘Our immediate priority is to continue to operate the Coryton refinery and the Teesside oil storage business without disruption while the financial position is clarified and restructuring options are explored.’ Warning: East of England Euro MEP Richard Howitt said he didn't want to be alarmist but said that the suspension could impact the Olympics . The Government insisted it was doing all it could to find a buyer. Forecourts fear a repeat of the crisis which caused chaos in Scotland in 2008 when the giant Grangemouth refinery was hit by strike action – leading to pumps running dry, ‘sold out’ signs, and some cases of petrol rationing north of the border. RAC Motoring Strategist Adrian Tink said: ‘The message for motorists in the area is a simple one – don’t panic buy and potentially  create a problem.’ East of England Euro MEP Richard Howitt said: ‘I don’t want to be alarmist about this, but I don’t want to be dishonest either. Supplies across London and the South East could be affected and I have been told this could impact the Olympics.’ Coryton has refining capacity for ten . million tonnes of crude oil per year. Some 36 per cent of its output is . petrol and 27 per cent diesel, the rest a mixture of other fuels. There . are seven other refineries in the UK – at South Killingholme and . Lindsey, both in North Lincolnshire; Fawley, near Southampton; . Grangemouth, near Falkirk; Stanlow in Cheshire; and Milford Haven and . Pembroke, both in Pembrokeshire. Petroplus previously owned a refinery . in Teesside, which closed in 2009. Panic stations: The refinery supplies 20 per cent of the petrol used in London and the South-East as well as other areas around the UK . The UK has 8,500 filling stations of which 2,132 are in the South East. Of these, about 600 are BP and Texaco sites supplied from Coryton. Petroplus reported a net loss of £265million in the first nine months of last year, while in December its banks withdrew a £675million portion of its £1.29billion credit facility. The other main supplier for the South East and London is the Exxon Mobil refinery in Fawley. A Department of Energy and Climate Change spokesman said it was helping to look for buyers but that the ‘immediate priority’ was to keep the Coryton refinery and Teesside storage business operating’. He added: ‘In the short term, companies have made alternative arrangements to ensure adequate supplies of products are available in the South East.’ Petroplus had been increasingly relying on its British offshoot for funds. At the end of 2009, it owed the British arm £42million. But by the end of 2010 the Swiss company’s borrowings from its British subsidiary had ballooned to £114million. The company’s fate was sealed when 13 banks, including Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and BNP Paribas, froze a $1billion loan that was keeping it going.","Signs warn supplies of diesel run out on forecourts .

The family of a death row inmate who sent a letter to a . local North Carolina newspaper boasting about his 'life of leisure' behind bars says the convicted murderer is mentally ill and fabricating his living conditions and they offered another letter as proof. Danny Hembree, Jr.'s sister released a letter sent to her from her brother earlier this month that contradicts the recently published two-page boast of leisurely conditions behind bars, disturbing the family of his 17-year-old murder victim. 'I try to put on a (nonchalant) attitude for you guys but it is . overwhelming and depressing to look at these walls and electric doors . and bright lights 24-7 and digest the fact that I'm never going to leave . here until they murder me or I just die either way I'm never leaving . here alive,' he wrote in the letter dated January 8 and published by the Charlotte Observer. Differing views: Family of death row inmate Danny Robbie Hembree Jr. produced a second letter by the convicted murderer that contrasts the felon's previously flaunted life behind bars . 'I'm bored to death,' he wrote her. 'No pun intended.' He signed it, 'Love, Danny Boy.' 'I'm so very sorry for any hurt or . anger that was caused by my brother Danny Hembree's letter to The Gaston . Gazette. He is a very depressed man and in his hopelessness, he lashed . out,' his sister Kathy . Hembree Ledbetter said in a statement released along with the letter to the Observer. When Hembree's boastful letter was reported by the Gazette this week, District Attorney Locke Bell told ABC that the father of murdered Heather Catterton called him in tears saying, 'He murdered our . daughter, got the death penalty and now he's just sitting in jail . laughing at us!' Hoping to prove otherwise, his sister published the second letter '...in order to try . to reveal the truth about his mental and emotional state which was . brought out at his trial.' Life behind bars: Hembree is waiting for his execution in Central Prison of Raleigh, North Carolina but in the meantime described his stay as a luxury, upsetting his victim's family . 'No person in their right mind thinks that living in death row is a life of leisure,' his son Danny Hembree III told . ABCNews.com in response to the earlier week's letter. 'There's no good explanation for why he wrote that . except he's mentally ill.' In agreement, his sister also attested to Hembree having a 'severe mental illness for over 35 years of his 50 years of life. He is not happy, he is not comfortable and he is not well.' These latest revelations are a sharp contrast from the letter where he describes life as '...a . gentleman of leisure, watching color TV in the a/c, reading, taking naps . at will, eating three well-balanced meals a day.' Hembree (left) if accused of the murder of Heather Catterton (right) who was 17 at the time of her death . His son agreed himself that letters sent to their family directly, as their only means of communication between them, express his pain and discomfort behind bars. 'He talks about the four walls closing in, that the lights are always on and . he can't sleep. Death row is a horrible place for anybody to be,' his son said. 'He's very severely depressed. He has told us that he's depressed. He . feels like it's over for him.' Taunting his victim's family this week, Hembree wrote: 'Is the public aware that the chances of my lawful murder taking place in the next 20 years if ever are very slim?' Hembree, 50, was found guilty of killing the 17-year-old girl in 2009, a crime both his sister and son do not believe he committed. Sentenced: Hembree was sentenced to death in November for murdering the 17-year-old girl in 2009, as he's seen here blowing his mother a kiss before leaving for death row . During a police interrogation he admitted to killing two other women, though he now says that he was lying to distract authorities and cover up other crimes. 'In every one of those confessions on all of those tapes, he was coming off a . three-day crack binge. He hadn't slept, he was drunk and highly intoxicated. He . could barely hold his head up,' Hembree III said. 'He's not a killer,' his sister told the Observer. 'He did not kill those girls.' 'I am a man who is ready to except [sic] his unjust punishment and face God Almighty with a clear conscience unlike you cowards and your cowardly system. 'Kill me if you can, suckers. Ha! Ha! Ha!' he wrote this week to the Gazette. Hembree was sentenced to death on November 18 for the murder of Ms Catterton and has been waiting in Central Prison in Raleigh, North Carolina. His other alleged victims: Randi Saldana (left) had a 2-year-old child at the time of her death, and Deborah Ratchford . (right) was killed in 1992 . In spite of Hembree's declarations of . grandeur, the conditions of Central Prison have been under a microscope . in recent months since the prison warden resigned after the despicable . treatment of prisoners with mental illnesses. Alvin . Keller stepped down in November- coincidentally the day after Hembree . was sentenced- following the results of an investigation that showed . mentally ill inmates being left unattended for weeks at a time and found . in cells covered with human feces. The . conditions in Hembree's cell seem much more luxurious, however, and he . boasted about his free government health care in the letter. I'm housed in a building that connects to the new 55 million dollar hospital with round the clock free medical care 24/7.' The gloating letter is not the only one that Hembree sent from prison which is due to be controversial. He . also mailed an inflammatory letter to the NAACP attempting to goad them . into fighting for one of his alleged victims, saying that the state’s . justice system was playing racial favorites. In . addition to Ms Catterton, Hembree is thought to have killed to other . women- Randi Dean Saldana, 30, whose burnt remains were found in South . Carolina in 2009 and Deborah Ratchford, 30, whose body found in 1992. Ms . Saldana and Ms Catterton, who were friends and both had a history of . drug arrests at the time of their death, were white and Ms Ratchford was . black. Hembree wrote to the African-American . civil rights group arguing that Mr Bell is trying the cases of the two . white women first for racially-motivated reasons. ‘I . implore your great organization to pressure Mr. Bell until he gives . Debora Ratchford her day in court in the interest of justice,’ Hembree’s . letter said. Both of his letters display a flagrant disregard for the victims families and his lack of remorse. 'I . laugh at you self righteous clowns and I spit in the face of your so . called justice system. The state of North Carolina has sentenced me to . death but it's not real,' he wrote in the letter to the Gaston Gazette. Central Prison . Central Prison was the first to be built in North Carolina, and was established in December 1884. It was built by inmates themselves and took 14 years to construct. Though it originally cost $1.25million to build, construction costs have gone up over the past century, and a major renovation in the 1980s cost $28.8million. The prison holds 1000 inmates and provides work for the 700 members of staff. Central Prison serves as the state's main execution chamber and houses all inmates on death row. On a lighter note, it has Bible study classes, team sports and job assignments within in the prison for 260 prisoners.

"By . Luke Salkeld . Last updated at 5:05 AM on 24th January 2012 . It is a country estate of such beauty that it inspired the composition of one of our best loved hymns. But the mansion behind ‘All Things Bright and Beautiful’ was the subject of an unholy row in court today over its modernised interior. Conservation officials failed in their demand for access to Llanwenarth House to check on renovations and were told by the owner: ‘An Englishman's home is his castle.’ Millionaire Kim Davies, 56, told a court how planning inspectors had made up to 20 visits to the country mansion after they feared the Grade II listed property had been given a ‘footballer's wife-style’ makeover. Dispute: The ivy-clad Llanwenarth House in the Usk Valley near Abergavenny, owned by Kim Davies, has been at the centre of an argument over renovation work that has taken place inside the Grade II listed property . Inspirational: The fittings inside the South Wales county pile include this ornamental whirlpool . But he refused their request for an architectural historian to inspect the Elizabethan manor which is nestled in the idyllic Usk Valley in South Wales, and Brecon Beacons National Park Authority took him to court. Previous close inspection of the house was carried out by Irish composer Cecil Alexander in 1848, who was so impressed by the surroundings that she wrote one of her most famous and popular pieces. The ‘purple-headed mountain’ in one verse of the  hymn is thought to refer to  the nearby Sugar Loaf and Blorenge peaks, while ‘the river running by’ in the next line is the River Usk which winds along the valley floor close to the estate’s boundary. The home is currently for sale at £2.25million but work carried out Mr Davies has come in for close scrutiny. National Park planning officer Clare Jones told the hearing she had visited the property at least 10 times and wanted to carry out further checks. She said: ‘The authority has now engaged a conservation expert who needs to advise us about the works that have taken place. Renovation: Mr Davies has installed a chandelier light in the kitchen of Llanwenarth House. The dispute arose after he refused to allow an architectural historian to inspect the Elizabethan manor to see what changes were being made . Checks: The court heard that council officials made up to 20 visits to the property to assess the work and eventually took out an injunction to make sure no further building took place . ‘He will advise the authority if the history of the building has been compromised and on remedial work to put the building back to its original state.’ Mr Davies, a builder and car dealer, bought the house for £675,000 in 2007 and has since spent more than £1million on it. He admits that a new kitchen and bathrooms have been installed but claims the work falls outside the restrictions on listed buildings. Planning officials were called in after it was compared to a ‘footballer's wife monstrosity’ which may have damaged the historic gem and an injunction was taken out to stop further work. Cecil Frances Alexander (nee  Humphreys) was a poet who also penned at least 400 hymns. She . was born in Dublin in 1818, and spent much of her later life in . Londonderry and Strabane with her husband, William Alexander, who became . Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland. Mrs . Alexander was a keen supporter of the Oxford Movement, and in 1848 . published Hymns For Little Children, which include three of the most . popular hymns in the English language: All Things Bright and Beautiful, . Once In Royal David's City and There Is A Green Hill Far Away. The book was published in 69 editions and all the profits were given to Irish charities. She died in 1895 and is buried in Londonderry. Mr Davies told magistrates in Abergavenny that he had always complied with the regular inspections by the National Park officials. But he opposed the application for a warrant to enter the property saying: ‘Enough is enough.’ He continued: ‘I have to take a stand. No further work has taken place since their last visit. ‘My sister is suffering from cancer and is convalescing at my home at the moment. ‘They have been there up to 20 times and I'm not prepared to let them come again.’ Dr Charles Mynor, representing Mr Davies, told the hearing: ‘There is no evidence of any new works or that anything extra has happened. ‘It seems that the National Park are coming back for another bite of a cherry that has already been bitten on many occasions.’ The magistrates refused to grant the Brecon Beacons National Park a warrant to enter the property and awarded £500 costs to Mr Davies. Chairman of the bench Dr Christopher Rowlands told the court: ‘Mr Davies has said under oath that no further work has been carried out on the property and on those grounds the application is refused.’ After the case, Mr Davies said: ‘I have always welcomed the National Park people when they have visited my home. ‘But it is my home and there has to be a limit to the number of times they want to have a look around. ‘I would get a letter one day saying they were coming the next. I opposed the warrant because quite simply enough is enough. ‘An Englishman's home is his castle - only in this case it's a Welshman's home.’ Photographs used by the estate agent show the inside of the seven-bedroom house has changed considerably since the time of Mrs Alexander’s visit. The kitchen has a large chandelier and granite tops while the bathroom boasts an ornamental Jacuzzi bath, and there is nothing Mrs Alexander would recognise about the high-ceilinged cinema room. Inspiration The 'purple-headed mountains' and 'river running by' of the Usk Valley are referred to in the hymn All Things Bright and Beautiful, penned at Llanwenarth House by Irish composer Cecil Alexander . The estate agent description states: ‘Much of its character still remains yet the expansive home also embodies great comfort and ease of living.’ But the refurbishment work by property developer has not won universal songs of praise. Before the hearing Monmouthshire county councillor Christine Walby said: ‘The house is an architectural gem and the park authority has a legal obligation to ensure that listed buildings are preserved. Mrs Alexander, who also wrote Once in Royal David’s City, died in 1895 at the age of 77. It has been claimed that All Things Bright and Beautiful was also inspired by countryside near Dunster in Somerset, and the poetry of Samuel Taylor Coleridge. The words in turn influenced the works of James Herriot, who used the ‘all creatures great and small’ line as the title of his books about the life of a vet in the Yorkshire Dales.","Mansion was inspiration for hymn 'All Things Bright and Beautiful'

"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 8:55 PM on 27th January 2012 . Tragedy: Daniel Cripps, 22, died after downing 14 shots of vodka at the party in Newport, the inquest heard . A aspiring model who downed 14 shots of vodka at a party choked to death on his own vomit after paramedics told him to 'sleep the drink off', an inquest heard. Daniel Cripps, 22, was told he did not need to go to hospital even though he was severely drunk at the house party in Newport, Gwent. However, minutes later he choked and his friends had to call for a second ambulance. His father, Michael, 44, is taking legal action and said his son would still be alive today if the emergency workers had taken his son to hospital the first time around. The party took place just a five-minute drive away from Newport's Royal Gwent Hospital. Party host Danielle Baker, 24, told the inquest in Newport yesterday: 'Daniel was drinking the shots in quantity. He was fine at first but later he was completely out of it. 'We were worried about him so we called an ambulance. The paramedics told him that he needed to sleep and let it wear off. 'I was surprised that they left him and we thought he should have gone to hospital in the ambulance. After they left, he began being sick and his lips turned blue. 'We called a second ambulance which arrived nearly half an hour after the first paramedics left.' The keen sportsman was later found to be almost four times the legal drink-drive limit for alcohol. Paramedic Ian Powell said he and a female colleague were called to the party in the early hours of April 25, 2010, where they assessed Mr Cripps. 'Go to bed': Wales Ambulance Service paramedic Ian Powell said that the decision was taken not to take Daniel, 22, to hospital because of the environment he was in (file photo) He said he then applied what is known as the Glasgow Coma Scale, which is widely used to record consciousness levels in patients. The scale, which ranges from 1 to 15 with a healthy, unimpaired person measuring 15, regards a level 8 as severe or comatose. The paramedic said that he put Mr Cripps at level 8. He agreed when asked by the coroner that Mr Cripps was 'severely under the influence of alcohol' but said such cases were common at weekends. He said that, based on the fact that he was in a safe environment with friends who were looking after him, he decided to leave Mr Cripps where he was. 'I was swayed by the people who knew him and the quiet place he was in. That is why I made my decision,' he said. However, they were forced to phone for a second ambulance around 20 minutes later. Dr Charles Deakin, an independent health expert, was later brought in to review the case. Nearby: Daniel Cripps, 22, was at a party just a five minute drive away from Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales . Mr Bowen read out a section in which Dr Deakin concluded he would expect an experienced paramedic to take a patient to hospital if he was judged to be an 8 on the Glasgow scale. But the report added: 'However, the risk of death from leaving Daniel at the scene was likely to have been less than one per cent.' Mr Bowen added that Dr Deakin regarded that as a 'significant risk'. Gwent corner David Bowen recorded a narrative verdict which amounts to a neutral recounting of the events leading to death. Michael Cripps, speaking outside Newport coroner's court, said his son should have been taken to hospital as a matter of urgency. 'If he had been taken to hospital he would be alive now and we would not be here today,' he said. 'I am distraught to be quite honest with you. Daniel was a kind, generous and loveable person. A keen sportsman who was already hungry. 'The paramedic that made this decision is still working. I don't know how he feels but I think he should be put through rigorous retraining.' A spokesman for the Welsh Ambulance Service said: 'The Welsh Ambulance Service accepts the coroner's verdict and would like to offer its sincere condolences to the family at this difficult time. 'The trust has ensured that all learning from cases like this help to improve our services for the future.'","Daniel Cripps, 22, choked on his own vomit after ambulance worker told him to sleep the drink off .

"By . Wil Longbottom . Last updated at 12:10 PM on 27th January 2012 . The Japanese government's worst-case scenario at the height of the Fukushima nuclear crisis last year would have seen the evacuation of tens of millions of people and the capital Tokyo, a report has revealed. A 15-page internal document, kept secret over fears of widespread panic, casts doubt on whether the Japanese government was sufficiently prepared to cope with an evacuation on an unprecedented scale. It also adds to complaints in the country that the government withheld too much information about the world's worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl. Secret: Evacuees crowd a check in at Narita airport, east of Tokyo. A government report revealed 40million people may have had to flee if the worst case scenario hit the Fukushima power plant . Ghost town: An empty shopping street in Tomioka town, within the 20km Fukushima exclusion zone. If there had been a full meltdown at the plant, everyone within a 105-mile radius would have to have been evacuated . Crippled: The number three reactor at Fukushima nuclear power plant, which was heavily damaged by the tsunami in January last year . The report was submitted to then-Prime Minister Naoto Kan on March 25, two weeks after an earthquake and tsunami devastated the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant, causing three reactors to melt down and generating hydrogen explosions that blew away protective structures. Workers ultimately were able to bring the reactors under control, but at the time it was unclear whether emergency measures would succeed. Mr Kan commissioned the report, compiled by the Japan Atomic Energy Commission, to examine what options the government had if those efforts failed. Authorities evacuated 59,000 residents within 12 miles of the Fukushima plant, with thousands more evacuated later from other towns. Abandoned: Wheelchairs left outside Okuma Town Health Center after more than 50,000 people were evacuated from the vicinity of the Fukushima reactor . Damage: The tsunami in March last year caused catastrophic damage to the plant, resulting in the partial meltdown of two of the reactors . Deserted: Weeds grow along the Joban train line in Futaba town. Those evacuated are still not able to return due to high radiation levels . Debris: A boat and a car are left at the side of the road after the massive wave smashed along the coastline following a 9-magnitude quake . The report looked at how the crisis could escalate - including explosions in the reactors, complete meltdowns and the structural failure of cooling pools used for spent nuclear fuel. It said that each contingency was possible at the time it was written, and that it would force workers to flee the vicinity and the situation at the plant would then deteriorate unmitigated. In that case, evacuation orders would have had to be issued for residents within a 105-mile radius of the plant, and 'voluntary' evacuation for everyone living with 155 miles. That area would have included Tokyo and its suburbs, with a population of 35 million people, and other major cities including Sendai and Fukushima. Disaster: The 12-mile exclusion zone around the Fukushima plant is still in place. It was home to 78,000 people when the tsunami hit the nuclear facility . Under control: Last month, authorities announced that reactors at the Fukushima plant were in cold shutdown . Panic: People wait for buses in Tokyo after the massive earthquake in March last year. The government has been accused of hiding the scale of the Fukushima disaster . The report further warned that contaminated areas would not be safe for 'several decades'. It said: 'We cannot rule out further developments that may lead to an unpredictable situation at Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant, where there has been an accident, and this report outlines a summary of that unpredictable situation.' After Mr Kan received the report, he and other Japanese officials publicly insisted that there was no need to prepare for wider-scale evacuations. Rumours of the document grew this month after media reports outlined its findings and an independent panel was created to investigate possible cover-ups. Goshi Hosono, cabinet minister in charge of the nuclear crisis, acknowledged the document's existence earlier this month, but said the government had felt no need to make it public. 'It was a scenario based on hypothesis, and even in the event of such a development, we were told that residents would have enough time to evacuate,' he said. 'We were concerned about the possibility of causing excessive and unnecessary worry if we went ahead and made it public.' Japanese authorities have been repeatedly criticised for how they handled information amid the unfolding nuclear crisis. Officials initially denied that the reactors had melted down and were accused of playing down the health risks of radiation exposure. A radiation warning system, known as SPEEDI, identified high-risk areas where thousands of people continued to live while the reactors were in critical condition. Authorities did not use the data to order evacuations, claiming it was not accurate.","Secret report reveals everyone within 105 miles of plant would have had to be evacuated in event of full meltdown .

A lawyer who tried to redeem a multi-million dollar state lottery ticket last night gave up his claim for the jackpot after officials called it into question. Crawford Shaw, 76, of Bedford, New York, withdrew his claim in Iowa to a $10.3million ticket after officials demanded to know who he represented. His mysterious decision - made ‘because I'm not going to argue with the lottery’ - ends one of the strangest jackpot pursuits of all time. Mystery: Iowa Lottery CEO Terry Rich said on Thursday that it's the strangest situation officials can recall in the 26-year history of the lottery . The winning ticket was turned in last month on December 29, less than two hours before it would have expired a year after the drawing. Iowa Lottery officials tested and validated the ticket - but refused to pay out until they could verify the purchaser's identity, among other things. Officials identified the recipient as a corporation in Belize, Central America. The ticket was bought at a Des Moines petrol station in December 2010. The lottery now wants to know how Mr Shaw obtained the ticket to make sure it was not stolen and that a valid player bought it. Mr Shaw, who had signed the ticket as a . trustee for an entity he called the Hexham Investments Trust, never . revealed who was in the trust. Purchase location: Officials identified the recipient as a corporation in Belize. The ticket was bought at a Des Moines gas station in December 2010 (pictured) But officials said he misspelled the . name of the Bedford trust by leaving off the second ‘h’. Mr Shaw claimed . not to be a beneficiary of the trust. 'If we knew the details, we'd probably be writing a cheque tonight' Iowa Lottery CEO Terry Rich . In addition he told the Des Moines Register that he doesn’t know the identity of the person or people behind Hexham Investments Trust. Iowa Lottery officials gave him a deadline to tell them who he represented by 3pm local time today or forget about collecting the millions. In the meantime, the lottery revealed that Mr Shaw was ‘associated with criminal proceedings and bankruptcy filings in New York and Delaware’. Mr Shaw is the ex-CEO of bankrupt public . firm Industrial Enterprises of America - allegedly looted in a . $100million securities fraud scheme. Mistake: Officials said Crawford Shaw, 76, of Bedford, New York, misspelled the name of the Hexham Investments Trust by leaving off the second 'h' The chemical company, which Mr Shaw helped found, was looted and bankrupted in 2009 by a stock manipulation scheme. '(The probe will) ensure the integrity of the lottery and to determine whether those involved complied with state law' Iowa's attorney general . He was not charged with criminal wrongdoing but is a defendant in a civil suit by the firm. Mr Shaw claims to know nothing about the suit. In any case, he chose to call off his pursuit of the winning ticket payout, asking a Des Moines law firm to pass along his decision to lottery officials. The Iowa Lottery said that it received confirmation of Mr Shaw’s claim withdrawal shortly after 6pm on Thursday. The . lottery recently asked state criminal investigators to probe the . circumstances surrounding the purchase and redemption of the ticket.

An ageing mobster who first gained notoriety for helping steal a 45-carat diamond in 1980 has been convicted of being part of  planned robberies. Arthur 'The Brain' Rachel, 73, of Chicago, Illinois, grimaced as he was found guilty in a bench trial on three of four racketeering counts. He was known for being in a notorious gang 32 years ago who stole the Marlborough Diamond from the posh Graff jewellery store in London. Ageing criminals: (Left-to-right) Joseph Scalise, Arthur Rachel, and Robert Pullia were all part of planned robberies in Chicago, Illinois . In court: The Chicago trial, which was not connected to the jewellery theft, attracted attention partly because of the defendants' advanced ages . Co-defendants and fellow Chicago mobsters Joseph ‘The Monk' Scalise, 74, and Robert Pullia, 70, pleaded guilty in court last week. Scalise was an accomplice with Rachel in the daring daytime theft of the Marlborough Diamond in London, which was never recovered. The Chicago trial, which was not connected to the jewellery theft, attracted attention partly because of the defendants' advanced ages. But prosecutor Amarjeet Bhachu told reporters after Thursday's verdict that the men were far from harmless, elderly goofs. Helping out: Scalise, seen in a mugshot from 1980, was an accomplice with Rachel in the daring daytime theft of the Marlborough Diamond in London .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 5:25 PM on 27th January 2012 . Dead: Andrew Robert Levene, accused of killing a jewellery store owner and stealing $300,000 in diamonds, has been found hanged in his prison cell . An American man accused of killing a jewellery store owner, stealing $300,000 in diamonds and then fleeing to Europe has been found hanged in his Spanish prison cell. Andrew Robert Levene was found dead yesterday in Barcelona's Modelo prison, where he was detained following an international manhunt. An investigation into the death was under way but all signs indicated he had killed himself. Levene, 41, was charged with federal murder, robbery and firearm offences in the December 8 shooting of Yekutiel Zeevi. Zeevi was the owner of the YZ Manufacturers LLC store in Westport, Connecticut. Extradition proceedings in Spain had not yet begun. A Catalonia justice department spokesman said that, as with all people admitted to prison, Levene had been interviewed by prison authorities and showed no signs that he might do himself harm. Levene contacted Zeevi in early December, asking him for several diamonds that were valued between $45,000 and $75,000, U.S. authorities said. The evening before the shooting Zeevi met Levene, who examined the diamonds and was non-committal about buying them. Levene met with Zeevi again on December 8 under the ruse that he would buy several large diamonds. Instead, Levene is said to have shot and killed Zeevi. Levene, who had military training in the use of weapons, then stole about $300,000 in diamonds. Ronen Konfino, an executive at a New York diamond business, also was shot but survived and helped police with the investigation. Levene travelled from Philadelphia to the Dutch capital of Amsterdam on December 11 after missing a flight to Madrid. It was not immediately known why he had travelled to Barcelona or when he had arrived there. U.S. Embassy officials in Madrid said yesterday they were notified that Levene, also known as Robert Thomas, had died but could give no further details. Nava Zeevi, the widow of the jewellery store owner, told FoxNews.com she thought her husband's alleged killer 'got what he deserved'. She said: 'He did a cowardly act, I really don't care. I'm just happy he's not here anymore. Let him rot in hell. 'He would have gotten a lesser sentence in the trial, which would have talen a very long time. For me, it was a very happy day to learn about it, and for my family as well.' Westport city official Gordon Joseloff said Levene's apparent suicide is a tragedy for everyone, and called it 'a cowardly confirmation of his guilt'. He said: 'Not only has the suspect taken the life of a beloved Westport resident and caused immeasurable pain to the Zeevi family and friends here, he has now inflicted the same pain on his own family, also innocents in this tragedy.'","Andrew Robert Levene, 41, accused of killing Yekutiel Zeevi in Connecticut ."

Today, the bodies of three people were pulled out of the rubble, another 21 remaining missing and a further six are in hospital. Many of the missing are students who were taking a night course in computer studies in one of the office buildings. Others were employees of a consultancy business taking part in a training session on the seventh floor of the smaller of the two buildings.

"Demi's Lovelace role is rumoured to be filled by Chloë Sevigny . By . Sarah Fitzmaurice and Paul Thompson . Last updated at 9:21 AM on 27th January 2012 . Ashton Kutcher arrived back in Los Angeles tonight after his troubled estranged wife Demi Moore was released from hospital today. The 33-year-old actor looked strained as he quickly jumped behind the wheel of an awaiting SUV and sped off into the night after touching down at LAX airport. His arrival comes as the 49-year-old actress left the Sherman Oaks hospital where she has been recovering from a health scare which occurred on Monday night. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO... Mercy dash? Ashton Kutcher arrived at LAX airport in Los Angeles this evening after his troubled estranged wife Demi Moore was released from hospital today . The actor has been in Brazil for the last week where he has been busy attending a slew of events, including a Brazilian fashion show and a Florence And The Machine concert. But it appears that he may have cut his trip short following Demi's health drama. It is unknown whether he will rush to be by the actress' side, but his serious demeanor was certainly in stark contrast to Tuesday night, when he was seen partying in Sao Paulo just one night after Demi was first hospitalised. Concerned: The 33-year-old actor looked strained as he quickly jumped into an awaiting SUV . The Two And A Half Men star looked like he didn’t have a care in the world as he jumped up and down to a performance by Florence and The Machine on Tuesday night. Ashton was seen with a female companion as he celebrated at the Summer Soul Festival at Anhembi Arena in Brazil. Demi was rushed into hospital on Monday night at around 11pm after inhaling nitrous oxide, according to reports. Own pace: The Two And A Half Men star got behind the wheel himself and sped off into the night . She is understood to have been released from the Sherman Oaks hospital today. Sao Paulo is six hours ahead of L.A., . so news of the Demi’s heath drama broke around the same time that . Ashton was enjoying himself. Troubled: Demi was said to have been released from a Sherman Oaks hospital today after being rushed there on Monday night . A spokesperson for the star was not available for comment earlier today. Earlier today TMZ.com posted a video of Kutcher leaving a nightclub Wednesday night. While . the photographer asked Ashton: 'Is Demi okay?' the actor refused to . comment and got into a car with two people including a blonde woman. Demi’s daughter Rumer Willis is said to have tried to contact Ashton since he has been in Brazil about her mother’s health. A . source told Hollywoodlife.com: 'Rumer is devastated. She worries day . and night about her mother and has been watching her mom fall apart.' 'Rumer actually reached out to Ashton on several occasions and he just blew her off. 'He either wouldn’t answer or he’d say he’d help but nothing would happen.' Other reports say that Ashton is worried about his estranged wife but is moving on. 'Ashton is deeply concerned for Demi,' a source told People magazine. 'He . still cares about her and wants the best for her. But their marriage is . ending and they are both moving on with their lives.' Ashton . has not made comment on his estranged wife’s condition on his Twitter . page but has been updating fans with other topics, his last post was on . early Thursday morning, Brazil time. It has also been reported that Chloë Sevigny has just been drafted to star in Lovelace, which Demi just dropped out of. According to People she is joining the cast as 'a feminist journalist assigned to write a story about Lovelace.' It is believed this is the Gloria Steinem character Demi was going to play. Having fun: Ashton was seen partying at a Florence and The Machine concert the night after Demi was taken to hospital . The Striptease favourite collapsed . after taking nitrous oxide, also known as laughing gas, while at her LA . home on Monday night, it has been claimed. She allegedly inhaled the chemical out of a canister commonly . used in whipping cream cans. She allegedly collapsed after having a bad . reaction, according to TMZ. A source told the website the actress started to show symptoms of a seizure after ingesting large amounts of the substance. According . to the website the 911 tape that made the emergency call to alert an . ambulance for the actress won't include much detail when it is made . public. The L.A. City Attorney is recommending . that all references to drugs in the 911 conversation between the . dispatcher and one of Demi's friends to protect the actress's privacy. Living it up: The 33-year-old actor was seen clapping and jumping to the music as he stood with a female friend . The post split behaviour of her former husband Aston is being blamed by her friends for her hospitalisation. Friends said he is openly flirting with women and then calling his ex-wife when he is in a 'low moment' leaving her confused. He is also said to have caused an embarrassing scene when he confronted his wife at a Golden Globes party as she talked with basketball star Kobe Bryant when he made jealous comments. ‘Demi was talking to Bryant at a CAA Golden Globes party, and Ashton came over and made a scene. ‘He made jealous comments to Kobe, then Ashton went to the bar and was openly flirting with other women.’ A source said: ‘Ashton has been very sloppy about his private life. ‘He goes between doing ridiculous things and then making overtures to Demi. Did Ashton ignore Rumer? Demi's daughter tried to contact the actor while he was in Brazil, but he is said to have ignored her, according to reports . ‘She took her marriage very seriously, she gave it 100 per cent, and his behaviour is confusing to her.’ Moore,49, ended their six year marriage filing for divorce last November after 'Two and a Half Men' star Kutcher was accused of cheating on her with 23 year old Sarah Leal. Since the split he has been seen . flirting with numerous women, most recently with models at the Sao Paulo . fashion week in Brazil. A source told the New York Post his behaviour is to blame for Moore's health crisis. In happier times: Ashton and Demi at the Superbowl last year. In November last year the actress announced she was filing for divorce . ‘Demi put up with a lot from Ashton — and despite the rumors, she always gave him the benefit of the doubt,’ the source said. ‘But as soon as he admitted [infidelity], she asked him to leave. ‘She helped him build his career, and as soon as he got his own success he became very full of himself. He was pushing and pulling at her for months before they split. ‘Now he’s carrying on like a teenager, goes around with other women, and then, when he’s feeling scared and lonely, he reaches out to Demi. It’s really taking its toll on her. Demi is exhausted and humiliated. She needs some time to take care of herself and regroup.’",Demi's Lovelace role is rumoured to be filled by Chloë Sevigny .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:07 AM on 28th January 2012 . 'Hacktivist' group Anonymous and splinter groups associated with it have begun unleashing havoc around the world in a new wave of anti-piracy protests. Protests and website attacks have been seen across Europe from groups opposing the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, which many believe could lead to 'censorship of the internet'. The UK is among a host of European Union nations to have signed up to the controversial agreement, along with France, Spain, Ireland and Italy. Demo: Angry masked protesters made their point in Poland after their country became the latest to sign up to the anti-counterfeit agreement . Those opposed to the ACTA believe it could lead to authorities blocking content on the internet. Support in Poland for ACTA has sparked protests from the 'hacktivist' group Anonymous, who attacked several Polish government websites, leaving them unreachable for several days. Street protests of hundreds, and in some cases thousands of people, have also broken out across Poland for the past three days. In the Czech Republic, a local group aligning itself with Anonymous attacked the website of a group that supports ACTA. The group collects money for music production and distributes it to artists. A Twitter account called Anonymous Sweden claimed responsibility for the attack. It said in a tweet that the attack was carried out in protest against planned new copyright legislation in Ireland. Demonstrators say the agreement being signed across Europe will lead to 'censorship of the internet' Meanwhile, some 29,000 signatories have backed an online petition against plans to allow music publishers to take internet service providers to court to protect their material from file-sharing and online piracy. Protesters opposed to the new legislation also believe it could place excessive constraints on file-sharing and violate consumer rights. ACTA is a far-reaching agreement that aims to harmonize international standards on protecting the rights of those who produce music, movies, pharmaceuticals, fashion, and a range of other products that often fall victim to intellectual property theft. ACTA also takes aim at the online piracy of movies and music; those opposed to it fear that it will also lead authorities to block content on the Internet. A prominent Polish rock start, Zbigniew Holdys, has come out in support of ACTA, accusing the Internet activists - mostly young people - of profiting from pirated material online and trying to hold onto that practice. ACTA shares some similarities with the hotly debated Stop Online Piracy Act in the U.S., which was shelved by lawmakers last week after Wikipedia and Google blacked out or partially obscured their websites for a day in protest. Poland’s ambassador to Japan, Jadwiga Rodowicz-Czechowska, signed it in Tokyo. Speaking on Polish television, she said that Poland was one of several European Union countries to sign ACTA Thursday, including Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Romania and Greece. Several other industrialized countries, including the United States, Canada and South Korea, signed the agreement last year.","Website attacks and street protests over EU piracy agreement .

"By . Glen Owen . Last updated at 10:34 PM on 28th January 2012 . A Facebook director who told a public inquiry last week that the company had cracked down on ‘multiple identities’ was himself operating a ‘shadow’ log-in on the social networking site. Richard Allan, Facebook’s director of policy for Europe, told the Leveson Inquiry into media ethics that the company enforced a strict ban on people who did not represent themselves under their real identity. Lord Allan, an ex-Lib Dem MP and aide to Nick Clegg, who was hired last year to lobby the European Union on Facebook’s behalf, said the policy was rigorously enforced to stop people using bogus identities to carry out malicious acts. 'Shadow' account: Lord Richard Allan, Facebook's Director of Policy for Europe, was found to have another account, in contravention of the firm's policy . However, at the time Lord Allan spoke, he had two ‘presences’ on the site: One, ‘Richard Allan’, shows pictures and links to his work on Facebook. The other, ‘Ric Allan’, contained a silhouette in place of a picture and gave no indication of who lay behind it apart from ten ‘friends’, including the divorced peer’s girlfriend. After The Mail on Sunday started  to make inquiries about the ‘Ric Allan’ identity on Friday, it was swiftly deleted. Lord Allan told the inquiry that if people came to the site and did not present themselves under their real identity, they would not have a ‘meaningful experience’. ‘We have a security team constantly looking for the people trying to get around the system,’ he said. ‘The sort of people carrying out malicious behaviour will use false identities. We find the strongest protection is that community of users. Privacy is a notion at the heart of what we’re trying to do.’ Both the ‘Richard Allan’ and the ‘Ric Allan’ Facebook identities include  Ana Padilla as one of the friends. Dr Padilla, who works for the parliamentary office of science and technology at the House of Commons, is the mother of Lord Allan’s twin babies. The issue of Facebook identities became controversial last year when author Salman Rushdie was told he had to use his birth name Ahmed on his profile instead of his middle name Salman. His account was deactivated until he made the change to reflect the name on his identity documents. Lord Allan was Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg’s immediate predecessor as MP for Sheffield Hallam and acted as Mr Clegg’s campaign manager when he first stood for the seat in 2005. A Facebook spokesman said: ‘Richard Allan is an active user of Facebook, using his real identity. There was also an old Facebook account that he set up in 2009 and has not actively used since then. ‘He should have deactivated that account when he created a new one and this is exactly what he did as  soon as he was reminded that the old account was still live.’","Policy director for Europe found flouting firm's ban on using 'multiple identities'

A woman jumped to her death from a cliff top because she feared she was developing the dementia she had seen take a grip of her late mother. Unable to face becoming a burden on her family, Judith Iles, 60, wrote a suicide note to her husband and son which read: ‘So sorry – I’m turning into my mum – I couldn’t stand that.’ Last night her husband Tony said he did not blame her for choosing to end her life rather than suffer as her mother had. Suicide: Judith Iles, a retired GP surgery administrator, left a note for her husband and son Matthew (pictured) before jumping off a cliff . Beauty spot: The 60-year-old jumped 70 feet to her death in the Wye Valley . An inquest heard she jumped 70ft to her death at the Wintour’s Leap beauty spot in the Wye Valley in Gloucestershire, where she used to take walks before her illness. ‘I never thought Judith would do this, but actually, I think it was very brave,’ Mr Iles said. ‘For her, Alzheimer’s was a fate worse than death. It was her greatest fear.’ He said his wife had adored her mother and was haunted by the memory of her illness. ‘Judith watched her father spoon-feed her mother for 20 years,’ he added. ‘The memories haunted her. She would often say she couldn’t bear to put us through that.’ Devastated: Mrs Iles's husband Tony . Mr Iles said his wife of more than 30 years had loved life and ‘had a real sense of adventure’ before becoming ill. When she retired from her job as an administrator at a GP’s surgery, the couple had been ‘intending to enjoy life’ and travel all over the world. Last March they celebrated their 31st anniversary. Mr Iles said: ‘Our son had just been promoted and it was such a happy time. We thought life couldn’t get any better.’ But within a few months, her deteriorating health was making it difficult for the couple to do the things they had planned. They had to cancel several holidays after she suffered chest infections and panic attacks. ‘She would panic at nothing,’ Mr Iles said. ‘She knew it was ludicrous but she couldn’t stop. ‘Judith would say: “this is how my mother started”.’ Convinced she was in the early stages of dementia, Mrs Iles became increasingly anxious and unable to sleep. ‘She tried to get help, but nothing worked,’ Mr Iles said. ‘She was referred to the mental health team but they said she was not suffering from a mental health problem and they could not help her.’ Within a few months, she stopped going out at all, and no longer wanted to see lifelong friends. Even seeing her son Matthew became too much of an effort. Tragic: Mrs Iles told her husband she was going into Chepstow, pictured, but after failing to return home she was reported missing . ‘She made a monumental effort in front of Matthew not to look poorly,’ Mr Iles said. ‘But after his visits she would almost wish he hadn’t come – not because she didn’t want to see him, but because it was so difficult for her.’ In October last year, Mrs Iles told her husband she was going into town. At the time he had been ‘pleased’ to hear that she wanted to go out, Mr Iles said. But after a few hours,  he and Matthew, a Bristol University chemistry graduate who  now works in cancer research, became worried and started searching for her. They found her body at the foot of a cliff in a disused riverside quarry in Tutshill, near their home in Chepstow. A post mortem examination found she had died from multiple injuries. Returning a verdict of suicide, assistant deputy Gloucestershire coroner Katy Skerrett said: ‘It appears that she and her husband had a happy life until last year, but she became stressed and anxious and deteriorated very rapidly despite efforts to find help from many sources. ‘Having seen the note she left and taking it with the other evidence, I can be sure that she intended to take her own life and did so.’ Mr Iles said his wife should have got ‘better care’ from doctors when she sought help for her anxiety. ‘The doctor said it was anxiety in his referral, and the local mental health team replied saying it “did not meet the criteria of serious mental illness”,’ he said. ‘Six weeks later she’s jumped off a cliff – how’s that not  mental illness?’ He said he now wanted an inquiry into why his wife was not given the help she needed sooner. ‘I don’t want anyone else to have to suffer how she did,’ he added.","Judith Iles found at the bottom of a quarry by her son .

Ms Shevell said in a news conference Wednesday that she’s resigning from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board, which oversees the vast public transit network in New York City. She served on the board for 11 years and was appointed in 2001 by then-New York governor George Pataki. Not going your way: Nancy Shevell, seen at an MTA meeting in 2009, will step down from the transit board . Hello, goodbye: Nancy Shevell wed Sir Paul McCartney, right, last October after dating four years . Easily the biggest star-power to the MTA board, Ms Shevell stayed on as a holdover after her most recent term expired in 2010. ‘I’m very emotional and sad right now,’ she told board members. ‘In my 30-year professional career, this has been the highlight.’ Though she didn’t give a formal reason for her resignation, she told reporters: ‘It was time.’ She said she now plans to divide her time between New York City and London. Sir McCarthy owns a townhouse in London and a massive estate in East Sussex. Let it be: Nancy Shevell served on the MTA's board for more than a decade . She married the former Beatle in October in a quiet ceremony. The 51-year-old trucking heiress kept out of the limelight during the couple’s four-year courtship. Friends say there was ‘some good-natured negotiation’ before Ms Shevell finally relented to her fiance’s wishes and agreed to make their marital base in Britain, instead of at her home in New York’s exclusive Upper East Side. Ms Shevell, who is 18 years younger than her husband, is the heiress to a vast $400million fortune from her trucking magnate father Myron 'Mike' Shevell’s New Jersey company. Helter skelter: The MTA may soon face another possible transit strike . When she isn’t dating music legends or running subway systems, Ms Shevell devotes her time to philanthropies. In 2010, she was criticised for skipping several MTA public hearings in favour of a ball at Lincoln Centre, the New York Daily News observed. She leaves the MTA just as rumours of another transit strike loom. The last strike, which happened in 2005, saw some 34,000 union workers walk off the job, leaving millions of commuters stranded.","Appointed to MTA board in 2001 and stayed on past 2010 term in holdover .

"By . David Baker . Last updated at 2:02 PM on 28th January 2012 . Anton Ferdinand was today spared having to shake John Terry's hand before QPR's FA Cup clash with Chelsea. The Football Association gave the clubs permission not to take part in the traditional pre-match handshake, amid uncertainty as to whether Rangers defender Ferdinand would snub Terry. Today is the first time the two sides have met since Terry was charged with racially abusing Ferdinand during October`s Premier League game between the two. Handshake: Chelsea captain John Terry and Queens Park Rangers' captain Joey Barton are the only players to shake hands ahead of the FA Cup Fourth Round match at Loftus Road . Terry has denied the offence and Ferdinand was reportedly agonising over whether or not to accept his hand. The FA released a statement, which read: 'Following discussions on Friday evening and Saturday morning involving senior officials from QPR, Chelsea and the FA, it has been agreed there will not be the usual team handshake before today's FA Cup fourth-round tie at Loftus Road. 'The FA agreed to the request by both clubs in an attempt to further defuse tensions before the match.' Tensions: John Terry and Anton Ferdinand were on opposite sides at Loftus Road . Challenge: Chelsea's John Terry goes up for a challenge with Anton Ferdinand after the pair were spared a contentious hand-shake after the routine was cancelled by the FA . During today's game Ferdinand's first touch was greeted with huge cheers from the home support but shortly after half time fans were reported to be throwing objects at each other. Chelsea went ahead in the cup clash around the hour mark as QPR goalkeeper Paddy Kenny was sent the wrong way by a Juan Mata penalty. The decision to award the spot kick came after Daniel Sturridge went down in the box, following a tackle from Clint Hill. Going down: Daniel Sturridge earns Chelsea a penalty in their 1-0 win over QPR . That spot kick settled the cup tie and Chelsea sailed through to the next round but the cancelled handshake was the real talking point. It is not the first time John Terry has been at the centre of a handshake row. Two years ago Manchester City defender Wayne Bridge snubbed Terry's hand as the pair met for the first time since revelations about Terry's alleged affair with Bridge’s ex-partner Vanessa Perroncel. Yesterday Ferdinand had been the target of a death threat on the eve of his reunion with race-row rival John Terry. Juan nil: Mata scored from the spot after Sturridge was adjudged to have been fouled in the penalty area . He was sent a bullet in the post just 24 hours before QPR met Chelsea in the FA Cup, according to Sky News. A . Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ‘I can confirm we are investigating . an allegation of malicious communication received today at Queens Park . Rangers football club. ‘Officers from Hammersmith and Fulham are investigating.’ Cup: John Terry arrives at Loftus Road for Chelsea's FA Cup clash with QPR . The report is a chilling echo of when . Celtic manager Neil Lennon was mailed a bullet, death threats and . parcel bombs earlier this year. The revelation was thought to put . Ferdinand's planned appearance in the game in jeopardy but the defender . made the starting line-up. The QPR defender was allegedly the victim of a racist slur from the England captain during . October's Barclays Premier League game between the sides. It is the first time since that game, which QPR won 1-0, and just four days . before the court case begins in which Terry stands accused of abusing . Ferdinand, that the pair have come up against each other. Precaution: Police await the arrival of John Terry and other Chelsea stars in the lead up to their game against Anton Ferdinand's QPR . Derby: Security for QPR's clash with Chelsea has been stepped up after Anton Ferdinand recieved a package containing a bullet in the post . The match was brought forward to 12pm today amid concerns from both clubs and the authorities that there could be an incend.'iary atmosphere. Playing on: Terry looks certain to appear in tomorrow's game . Chelsea fans have previously been heard chanting: 'Anton Ferdinand, you know what you are . QPR manager Mark Hughes said: 'I think we understand what is meant by that. 'If there is inappropriate chanting or behaviour then you get ejected from the ground.' Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas said yesterday he hoped Ferdinand would not snub Terry. Ferdinand was said to be agonising over . whether or not to shake Terry's hand before the match but the decision was taken out of his hands. Asked yesterday if it was important they shook hands, Villas-Boas said: 'Extremely important, extremely important. 'This game is based on good values more than anything else. 'These players should continue to promote these good values.' Villas-Boas confirmed the matter had been discussed with Terry, who denies having racially abused Ferdinand. The Chelsea boss said: 'Everybody has been having conversations, from the top, to the players, to the manager.' Hughes, said: 'If he feels it is not appropriate, that has to . be his own decision. It won't be influenced by myself or the club.' Villas-Boas . reiterated he would not consider leaving out Terry and said he had not . felt the need to check on his frame of mind this week. 'No, not at all,' he said. 'I have to count on the player, and the player is fit and available for the game. He also revealed he had no plans to . issue special instructions to his players reminding them to stay calm . amid what is likely to be a hostile atmosphere. Admitting there were 'extra . responsibilities' to consider, he added: 'I won't speak to the players . specifically about that before the game, not at all.' 'Supporters . from both sides were this week warned about their conduct and . Villas-Boas predicted there would not be any problems at QPR's Loftus Road ground. He said: 'The environment was outstanding the last time we played there at Loftus Road, so I expect it to be the same.' Hughes says QPR are ready to eject anyone making trouble. 'We as a club obviously have spoken quite closely with Chelsea and the police. I just hope everybody is sensible and enjoys the game for what it is, a fantastic cup tie that we're all looking forward to. 'We basically want to be talking about the football and what happens on the pitch.'","Only captains forced to shake hands before cup clash .

The pair are both due to retire together next year when Charlie jnr finally steps down after 50 years working for the business. Charlie snr said: 'It keeps me active and I'm on first-name terms with most of the customers, so it's a social thing as well. 'I'm very lucky that I've kept my faculties and I still like to get around on the bike to get some exercise. 'I did retire in the 1980s but the workload was a lot for my son, so I offered to help and I'm still here now.' Charlie snr was born in Swindon, Wiltshire, in 1922 and worked as an apprentice boilerman before becoming a shipbuilder in Cowes during World War Two. He married wife Phyllis in 1938 they returned to Swindon after the war in 1948 to follow in the footsteps of Charlie's sister Sue, who already ran a successful newsagents in the town.

Charlie snr started a newspaper delivering 'round' which he ran from home until 1962 when he bought a shop in Ermin Street for less than £1,000. He named it Reynolds Newsagent and originally ran a team of up to 15 paperboys each delivering up to 50 papers each. Back then newspapers cost just one 1p each and the business made 1p profit per week on each property they delivered to. Charlie snr and Phyllis, now 93, built the business into an Open All Hours-style local store. He said: 'It was a very lucrative business in those days. I remember my sister and her husband being the first people I knew to have a motor car. Community store: Charlie Reynolds opened the shop in 1961 and had his son - now 64 - working with him from the age of 15.

When we worked full time we were up long before 6am and worked in the shop until after 6pm every night.' End-of-terrace shop: The store in Ermin Street, Stratton, opened its doors more than 50 years ago -when a loaf of bread cost the equivalent of just 5p and people smoked Woodbines .

"Had arranged for a substitute priest to . cover for him while he took time out to reflect on his vows . Double life unmasked after his niece Elisabetta who was with him on cruise posted online that her family, including 'Uncle Massimo', were safe . By . Nick Pisa . Last updated at 6:53 PM on 27th January 2012 . Father Massimo Donghi lied to his friends and told them he was going on a spiritual retreat but was actually on the Concordia cruise liner disaster . A Roman Catholic priest who lied to his flock and told them he was going on a spiritual retreat is actually a survivor from the Concordia cruise liner disaster, it emerged today. Father Massimo Donghi’s double life was unmasked on Facebook after his niece Elisabetta, who was with him on the ill fated Concordia, posted that she and all her family 'including uncle Massimo' were safe and well. The 41-year-old clergyman had told church parishioners earlier this month that he was going on a ‘spiritual retreat’ for a couple of weeks and had arranged for a substitute priest to cover for him while he took time out to reflect on his vows as well as meditate and pray. Locals at Besana Brianza near Milan were delighted for him and waved him off with their full backing - although today they were furious to learn that instead of being on a retreat he had set off on a week’s cruise and was among more than 4,000 passengers and crew on the doomed boat that hit rocks two weeks ago. One furious local said:'It’s a bit . difficult to understand how he was going to go on a spiritual retreat . onboard a cruise liner. All those comforts and luxuries, all that . onboard enjoyment it just doesn’t sit well with a spiritual, prayerful . retreat. We are not at all happy that we have been tricked here and we . want to see what Father Massimo and the diocese have to say.' Father Massimo had boarded the Concordia . at Civitavecchia with several members of his family for the week’s . cruise and they were among those who were rescued as the ship went down . just off the coast of Giglio with the death toll now standing at 16 dead . and at least 13 still missing. On board: The 41-year-old clergyman had told parishioners that he was going on a 'spiritual retreat' for a couple of weeks but had really boarded the Concordia cruise liner disaster . Within hours of being rescued Elisabetta wrote on her Facebook page: . 'Uncle Massimo and granny Imelda are all safe. We all managed to get onto the lifeboats and we are safe and well.' The posting was spotted by friends who . quickly spread the word that Father Massimo - who was in the headlines . last year after he wrote a letter to a religious magazine slamming . controversial former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi  for his dubious . private life - was actually on a luxury cruise instead of being on a . spiritual retreat as he had said. Protest: A banner reading 'Giglio cries out - Hands off Captain Palombo' hangs on a balcony close to the stricken cruise liner in reference to the retired Captain Mario Palombo, that the Concordia's captain was waving to when the ship ran aground . Safeguarding: An oil recovery sea platform is seen next to the Costa Concordia cruise ship . On his Facebook page Father Massimo says he has been a priest since 1996 at Besana and he also lists Inter Milan as his favourite football team, as well as Pope John XIII as one of his inspirations - as well as the film The King’s Speech. Today when contacted an embarrassed sounding Father Massimo said: 'Well what more do you expect me to say? You have all the story. There is nothing to add. I’m still a little shocked but everyone who I was with is okay. I will explain everything to my parishioners when I get back to the church - I’m not bothered about what people say about me. God Bless. Good day.' No-one was available for official comment at his local bishop’s office but a source there said: 'We are aware of the reports and shall be speaking to him to hear what he has to say. We have had calls from the church from parishioners who were concerned.'","Had arranged for a substitute priest to .

"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 2:38 PM on 28th January 2012 . 'Inappropriate': Royal Bank of Scotland chairman Sir Philip Hampton has turned down a £1.4million bonus payout, it emerged today . RBS chief-executive Stephen Hester is under further pressure to turn down his near £1million bonus today after his own chairman rejected a payout. Sir Philip Hampton was in line to receive 5.17million shares - worth £1.4million - from the bank which is 83 per cent owned by the taxpayer. But he turned the payment down as he thinks it is 'inappropriate' to accept the windfall that he was to receive later this year. An RBS spokesman said: 'Sir Philip Hampton will not receive the 5.17 million shares he was awarded in 2009 when he joined RBS.' Mr Hester will now come under further pressure to follow suit and waive his payout. His . £963,000 payout has caused national outrage as the state-owned bank . has missed lending targets, laid off 3,500 staff and seen its share . price plunge 40 per cent. David Cameron said today that it was for Mr Hester to decide whether he should accept the payment. Sir Philip is believed to have taken his decision to reject the payment some time ago. He was in line to receive the shares as part of a deal negotiated by Lord Davies, a Labour peer, who was in line to take the job. When Lord Davies turned the post down, Sir Philip was given the post on the same package. David Cameron warned today installing . a new top team at failed bank RBS could be even 'more expensive' than . it is now as the furore of Stephen Hester's bonus continued. Pressure: Sir Stephen Hester is in line to receive almost £1million as a bonus and faces further pressure to turn it down . But the Prime Minister insisted it was up to the chief executive to decide whether to give up his £1 million bonus. 'It's a matter for him,' he said. 'It's obviously his decision. My . decision is to make sure the team at RBS get on with the job of turning . the bank round and we made our views very clear on the bonus and that's . why it was cut in half compared to last year.' A man wearing a 'fat cat' suit stands outside RBS in London earlier this week . Mr Cameron was speaking at Chequers . as news emerged that RBS chairman Sir Philip Hampton had decided to . waive his £1.4m shares bonus. Mr Cameron added: 'I think we need to get the facts straight. 'The fact is Stephen Hester was . brought in by the last Government, a contract signed by the last . Government to turn round RBS - a bank that had got itself into a . complete mess. 'The Government has made its views known and that is why his bonus was cut in half compared to last year. 'But we do have to bear in mind that . the alternatives to what's happening now could be even more expensive if . you had a whole new team coming into RBS.' Whitehall . sources said Mr Hester, who is on a basic salary of £1.2million, should . hand back the 'immoral' bonus as a gesture of good faith. Mr Hester may gain a further £400,000 if - as analysts expect - the 3.6million RBS shares that form his bonus rise in value. By close of trading last night, they were worth £998,000 - a rise of £35,000 in one day. Nick . Clegg said he shared the public's dismay and urged Mr Hester to copy . Antonio Horta-Osorio, of Lloyds, the other state-owned bank, in forgoing . his bonus. Under pressure: The Prime Minister said today it is for Sir Stephen to deceide whether he accepts a near £1m shares payout from RBS . Ed Miliband has accused David Cameron of a 'disgraceful failure of leadership' for failing to block Mr Hester's payment. 'He's been promising for months action against excessive bonuses, . executive pay, and now he's nodded through a million-pound bonus,' said . the Labour leader. 'He must now explain, not least to the British people, why he has allowed this to happen.' Rattled . by the public outcry, Number 10 and the Treasury sought to shift the . blame to the RBS board, saying it was being managed at 'arm's length' by . UK Financial Investments, the agency in charge of public banking . assets. Asked if Mr Cameron was 'relaxed' about the bonus payment a Number 10 spokesman replied: 'No.' A . senior government official told the Mail: 'Of course we'd like to see . him to give it up as a gesture of good faith but we have done what we . can. 'We can't tell . him to do that. He has done a good job and put the bank back on track . but that means those shares are likely to climb again in future. If the . share price bounces back... I hate to think of the stink that will . cause.' RBS has been criticised for failing to hit targets for lending to hard-pressed businesses.","Sir Philip Hampton rejects £1.4million payout - or 5.17million shares - he was due to receive this year .

"By . Gavin Allen . Last updated at 7:28 PM on 27th January 2012 . A student is counting the cost of cheap drinks promotions today after video of her dancing naked in an inflatable paddling pool at a nightclub went viral on the internet. The university student - who MailOnline has chosen not to identify - woke up this morning to find that a 10-minute video of the incident at Oceana nightclub in Cardiff had been circulated widely on Twitter. A student - who is not being identified by MailOnline - has been left embarrassed after a video of her stripping off in a nightclub went viral . Her behaviour is a classic example of Britain's binge-drinking culture - and the embarrassment it can cause. And the speed with which her drunken antics went viral highlights the power of social media. A one-minute version was available on YouTube and attracted more than 1,000 hits in less than 10 minutes. It has now been removed. The 20-year-old took part in a wet T-shirt contest as part of the Missbehaviour event - billed as 'Cardiff's naughtiest night' - where vodka and other spirits cost just £1.75 for a double. At the event, which boasts the cheapest drinks in Cardiff, bottles of lager and alcopops were on sale at £1.20. While other girls thought it enough to remove their tops, the student stripped off entirely and frolicked in the inflatable paddling pool. With another reveller filming the 'contest' on a mobile phone, she leans over the edge of the pool plays for the cameras. The Rihanna song S&M plays loudly in the background as men cheer and chant 'Off, off, off.' As the student is exposing herself herself, the MC uses his microphone to shout: 'Get em 'off'. The shame-faced student, who had clearly been drinking, used her Twitter account to send a message a day later which read: 'Yes I got drunk and yes I got naked. 'We all do things we regret and there is nothing I can do about it now!' The embarrassed student later Tweeted that she had also lost her underwear, her earrings and had not been given £50 prize money for the wet T-shirt competition. She was too embarrassed to comment when contacted to comment. Student Luke Brown, 23, said: 'There . was a lot of cheering going on and I looked around to see a naked girl . in the paddling pool. The student later posted this tweet of regret about the incident . 'She seemed to be having a good time and everyone was reaching for their mobile phones to video her. 'I think the club staff stepped in to cover her up but I’ve seen one of the videos on twitter and it lasts for 10 minutes. 'Everyone had a lot to drink - I’ll bet she’s regretting it now.' A spokesman for the Oceana club said: 'The night in question was a promoter event - this is where the event is put on and run by a third party. 'Oceana does not condone such behaviour. The embarrassing antics took place at Oceana nightclub in Cardiff . 'The Oceana door team dealt with the incident at the time and the clubs management has had the appropriate conversation with the promoter regarding this.' The video of the student in the paddling pool has now been removed from YouTube. Chris . Sorek, from alcohol education charity Drinkaware, said: 'There's nothing wrong with enjoying a . few drinks on a night out. 'But the digital world we live in means that people . who have been drinking to excess can have their actions come back to haunt them . online. 'What might appear fun when drunk can feel foolish and embarrassing in . the cold light of day. 'Drinkaware research shows that over a . third [38 per cent] of 18-24 year-olds admit to experiencing ""cybershame"" - regretting . something they've posted online when drinking on a night out. 'And 47 per cent of those . polled admit to un-tagging drunk photos of themselves they didn't want . others to see. 'Thirty eight per cent also reported feeling embarrassed about seeing pictures of . themselves online doing things they don't remember after a night of excessive . drinking.' He added: 'There . are simple ways to prevent a night taking a turn for the worse and avoid seeing . embarrassing posts and pictures splashed over the internet the next day. Eating . a meal before drinking or when out and making every third drink a soft one can . make the difference between having a good night or a bad one.' The Prime Minister has demanded each unit of alcohol be sold for no less than 40p to 50p in Britain's supermarkets (picture posed by models) Alcohol will be sold with a minimum price to deter binge drinking under plans ordered by David Cameron. The Prime Minister has demanded each unit of alcohol be sold for no less than 40p to 50p in Britain’s supermarkets. The . proposals, which Mr Cameron wants included in an alcohol strategy paper . to be published in February, will cost drinkers £700million a year. The Prime Minister has repeatedly said he wants a minimum price to help tackle Britain’s obesity and binge drinking epidemic. Government sources said he has overruled Health Secretary Andrew . Lansley, who favoured a voluntary system for retailers, and is insisting . that the basement price be imposed by law. The scheme will mirror one introduced in Scotland, where the sale of alcohol below 45p a unit is banned. It . will be accompanied by a public health campaign on television to . persuade people to moderate their alcohol intake. Extra tax revenue . raised from the plans will be ploughed back into the NHS. But . the strategy paper has been delayed as a result of arguments in . government about how to impose the change, which critics will challenge . as a nanny state measure. Government . lawyers have warned that an attempt to impose legal restrictions on . alcohol costs could fall foul of EU competition laws. Home . Secretary Theresa May, whose department deals with much of the fallout . from binge drinking on Britain’s streets, wants to tax drink on the . basis of alcoholic units. The Department of Business has warned that forcing firms to charge a minimum price could be illegal. There is also disagreement about . whether the minimum price would just be imposed on cheap supermarket . alcohol, or whether pubs would be targeted too. Some ministers are . concerned that would hit responsible drinkers too. Beer . and lager is currently taxed at 18p a unit, compared with 19p a unit . for wine and about 25p a unit for standard spirits. VAT, charged at 20 . per cent, is also added. A . recent official study found that setting a minimum price of 30p per . unit would prevent 300 deaths a year, 40p about 1,000 deaths, and 50p . more than 2,000 premature deaths.

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . Last updated at 1:09 AM on 29th January 2012 . Escape: The manhunt for Andrew Farndon is over after he was captured following a two-day search . A dangerous prisoner who went on the run has been arrested – hours after his mother made a TV appeal for him to give himself up. Andrew Farndon was held by police on Friday in New Cumnock, Ayrshire. He was 360 miles from the scene of his escape in Bury St Edmunds on Wednesday when two guards escorting him to hospital were threatened at gunpoint. Three other men and a woman have also been arrested and detained for allegedly ‘attempting to pervert the ends of justice’. Last night the prisoner’s mother, Kate Farndon, said: ‘It has taken a great weight off my mind. I had this terrible fear that he would be cornered and shot down in a hail of bullets. ‘My son is not the monster everyone has been making him out to be. I just hope he gets fair treatment and that he is safe back in prison.’ David Ruffley, Tory MP for Bury St Edmunds, last night called for prison officers on escort duties to be armed. He said: ‘I am very concerned that a dangerous prisoner was on the loose. The guards should have been capable of resisting intimidation by an armed accomplice of the prisoner.’ Farndon, 26, was jailed five years ago for a ferocious attack on a man with a baseball bat and a hammer that left his victim with a fractured . skull. He was found guilty of grievous . bodily harm and jailed but officials only classed him as a category C prisoner - meaning . he was deemed unlikely to make a determined escape attempt. A nationwide manhunt was launched after a male accomplice pointed a gun at the head of a female prison officer and ordered her to free him from his handcuffs. Farndon was being transported to the West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmunds for treatment after apparently stabbing himself in the shoulder while at Highpoint prison in Stradishall, Suffolk.It was the second time Farndon had escaped from custody. Racing away: CCTV images issued by Suffolk Police show a gunman approaching the scene at West Suffolk Hospital, left, and then leaving with prisoner Andrew Farndon, right . Witnesses: Police want to speak to these people, who they believe may have witnessed Farnon's escape . Investigating: A police car stands outside West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmunds, where the escape took place . At his trial at Coventry Crown Court . in April 2007 he escaped from the dock after a judge ordered him to be . detained for an indefinite period for the protection of the public. He . was recaptured 22 days later in Witley, Surrey. A spokeswoman for Suffolk Police . said: 'On Friday officers from Strathclyde Police arrested Andrew . Farndon in New Cumnock, Ayrshire. 'He is currently detained in police custody. 'A . further four people, three men aged 16, 33, 43 and a woman, aged 44, . have been arrested and are presently detained in police custody for . allegedly attempting to pervert the ends of justice. 'It is anticipated that all four will appear at Ayr Sheriff Court on Monday January 30.' Staff alert: Employees at West Suffolk Hospital reported seeing a man wielding a gun, which he aimed in the direction of two officers who were guarding Farndon . On guard: A police officer stands outside the entrance to the A&E department following the incident . HMP Highpoint, a Category C prison with around 380 inmates where Andrew Farden was being held . Forces . across Britain, including the neighbouring counties of Norfolk, Essex . and Cambridgeshire, along with West Midlands Police, had issued appeals . for information. Just hours before Farndon's arrest, his mother made a public appeal urging him to contact police. Asking . her son to hand himself in on Sky News, Kate Farndon said: 'Hi Andy . love, it's mum. I would like to know that you're ok, I would like to . know how your wound is, if it's serious, if you need medical attention, . but most of all sweetheart, I would like you to hand yourself in. 'This just isn't going to help anything. Please, please, love, hand yourself in.' Yesterday detectives released an e-fit likeness of the gunman who assisted Farndon in his escape. He is described as white, in his . mid-40s, around 5ft 8ins tall, of stocky build, possibly with a Scottish . accent and wearing a white top and blue jeans. The release of Farndon is the second in a week after John Anslow (pictured) was sprung from a prison van . The escape is the second in just a . week, after category A prisoner John Anslow was sprung from a prison van . after it left Hewell Prison in Worcestershire, though there is no . suggestion both escapes were linked. Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke has . ordered an inquiry into how Anslow, described as 'extremely dangerous' by police, became the first category A prisoner to escape in more than . 17 years on Monday. Instead of being transferred in a . high-security prison service van with a police escort, Anslow was with . other inmates in a van run by a private contractor. Three masked men ambushed the van, . smashing its windows with sledgehammers and punching the driver as he . was transporting inmates from the prison near Redditch to Stafford Crown . Court on Monday morning. An international manhunt has been . launched for Anslow with police liaising with other UK forces, the UK . Border Agency and foreign authorities. The search extends to all airports and railway stations. Anslow, also known as Skitz, has strong connections across the country, including London, as well as overseas, police said. A 44-year-old Tipton man arrested on . Monday night on suspicion of helping Anslow to escape was released on . bail pending further inquiries, police said.","Andrew Farndon, 26, was arrested in New Cumnock, Ayrshire .

"By . Charles Walford . Last updated at 2:55 PM on 26th January 2012 . The Queen, pictured earlier this month in Norfolk, takes most of her flights from RAF Northolt . Defence chiefs could be forced to sell off the Queen's airfield as the MoD looks to slash budgets. The department is considering plans . to sell RAF Northolt, which occupies hundreds of acres of prime real . estate in Hillingdon on the outskirts of north London, it has emerged. The site could be worth . hundreds of millions of pounds to property developers. The plan is part of a wider review of MoD property and comes as the department is under severe pressure to cut its budgets. The Queen currently takes most of her flights from Northolt, which is also home to the 32 (Royal) Squadron. And since June 1998, RAF Northolt station commanders have served as aides-de-camp to Her Majesty. It . is also understood there have been recent high-level discussions within . Whitehall to discuss a plan which would see the base – where Princess . Diana’s body was repatriated from France -  used as a satellite airfield . for Heathrow, rather than being developed. Former defence chief Air Commodore Andrew Lambert said it would be a great shame if the airfield was lost. He said defence cuts had already . forced the RAF to lose historic bases, and questioned whether it was . necessary to add Northolt to the list. He . told the Guardian: 'I am sure that the site would make lots of money . because it is a prime bit of real estate. But I'd want to know if the . MoD has done its sums properly. ‘The MoD is in a position where it is saying, ""we are running out of money, so let's sell something off to raise money"". Repatriation: Princess Diana's body was flown back to RAF Northolt after she died in Paris . Ready for action: Newly delivered Hurricane fighters are lined up at RAF Northolt in 1938 . Northolt opened in 1915 - three years before the formation of the RAF . 'We . might be in a position where it doesn't make sense over the long term. It would have quite a big impact because Northolt is where all the very . senior people and the royals fly from.' Northolt is one of the most famous Second World War airfields, housing . Spitfire and Hurricane squadrons which protected the capital during the . Battle of Britain. In 1943 it became the first airfield flying Spitfires into German airspace to support bomber operations. An industry source told the Guardian that the Heathrow satellite idea 'has its advocates because of its . location close to the capital and to Heathrow, and there are some . people who would welcome it'. They added: ‘But it shares some of the drawbacks of extending Heathrow, including the increase in noise for communities in west London.’ A . Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘As the Chancellor made clear . in his autumn statement, we will explore all the options for maintaining . the UK's aviation hub status with the exception of a third runway at . Heathrow. 'The government will consult on an overarching sustainable . framework for UK aviation this spring.’ It is not the first time such a proposal has been made. In the 1990s the Commons Transport Select Committee considered converting RAF Northolt into an offshoot of Heathrow. While the existing runways would cause aircraft to cross the flightpaths of those using Heathrow, new parallel runways were suggested. These suggestions were opposed by then MP for Ruislip-Northwood, John Wilkinson, and eventually the scheme progressed no further. Northolt . is currently where Air Force One lands during visits by the U.S. president, but Heathrow is just four miles away and could be used for . visiting dignitaries. Binyam Mohamed steps onto the tarmac at RAF Northolt after being released from Guantanamo Bay . Property developers would be keen to get their hands on the prime real estate west of London . There . are some in the military who will argue to retain an MoD ‘core’ at . Northolt, even if it becomes a commercial hub in the future. A Ministry of Defence spokesman told MailOnline: 'We continue to scrutinise all defence expenditure to secure the best value for money. 'RAF Northolt is no exception. It already generates revenue through landing fees from private flights and sources of income generation are of course kept under review.' An MoD source suggested a sale was 'unlikely'. In . recent years the base, which is the RAF’s oldest operational airfield, . has been placed in the spotlight due to the UK's apparent support of CIA . rendition flights. Three years ago the former Guantánamo Bay prisoner . Binyam Mohamed was flown back to Northolt after his release. In . 2001 seriously ill Great Train Robber Ronnie Biggs was flown from . Brazil to the airfield to be arrested by waiting police officers. It has also been used as a location for films made at Pinewood studios. The Prince of Wales lands at RAF Northolt following the death of his grandmother, the Queen Mother in March 2002 . In 1912 a proposal was made for the area around what is now RAF Northolt to be developed as ‘Harrow Aerodrome’. The outbreak of the First World War necessitated a new airbase for the Royal Flying Corps. Major Sefton Brancker of the War Office settled on a site near Northolt Junction railway station but it was not until January 1915 that the British government officially requisitioned the land. Construction of the aerodrome, to be named RFC Military School, Ruislip, began in January 1915. It opened on 3 May 1915, and became known as ‘Northolt’ despite actually being situated in South Ruislip, because the nearest station was Northolt Junction. In the same year the airfield was extended westwards and aircraft began flying sorties in defence of London against Zeppelin raids. In 1918 the RAF was founded, replacing the RFC. The Officers' Mess was built around 1920, and is still operational today as is one hangar and several barrack blocks dating from the mid-1920s to the 1930s. In the 1930s, RAF Northolt was the first station to operate the Hurricane and during the Second World War was again one of the key airfields in the defence of London. During the Battle of Britain, Northolt was 'home' to a series of allied and British Hurricane and Spitfire squadrons, including a complete Polish Wing. In 1943, RAF Northolt's Spitfire Mk IX Squadrons became the first Spitfire Wing as a unit to operate over Germany. One notable flight took place in 1944 when liberator 'Marco Polo' flew non-stop from Washington to Northolt, taking a mere 19 hours and 46 minutes. In 1946 the airfield was loaned for civil use while Heathrow Airport was under construction and by 1952, Northolt was the busiest airfield in Europe. In December 1946, after taking off during a heavy snowstorm, a Douglas DC-3 operated by British European Airways, flying from Northolt to Glasgow, crashed onto the roof of a house in South Ruislip. A Douglas DC-3 Dakota crashed on the roof of a house in Ruislip shortly after taking off from Northolt in December 1946. Everyone escaped and left the house by the front door . All the crew and passengers escaped unharmed by climbing through the loft of the house and leaving via the front door. Civil flights ceased when the central area at Heathrow opened in 1954 with Northolt reverting to sole military use in May that year. By the 1980s movements of privately-owned aircraft, mainly corporate jets, outnumbered military aircraft. Civil flights were limited to 28 per day, with a maximum of 7,000 a year. This limit remains to this day. Much media attention focused on the airfield when the body of Diana, Princess of Wales, arrived there from Villacoublay airfield, in Paris after her death on 31 August 1997. The Queen's Colour Squadron, then based at neighbouring RAF Uxbridge, acted as the bearer party. Four years later attention again focused on Northolt when the seriously ill fugitive Great Train Robber Ronnie Biggs was flown from Brazil to the airfield to be arrested by waiting police officers. Biggs was taken straight to Belmarsh Prison to complete the remainder of his sentence. Over the past 60 years it has been used to welcome foreign dignitaries to the country.","RAF Northolt could be worth 'hundreds of millions' to developers .

The woman who accused New York police commissioner Ray Kelly’s son of raping her last October said she got pregnant from the attack and subsequently aborted the baby, police sources say. Greg Kelly, 43, was absent Thursday morning from his job as anchor of . the popular local morning show 'Good Day New York' and through a lawyer . denied the allegations. Lew Leone, the general manager of the local Fox station, has meanwhile confirmed Kelly 'has requested some time off' while the investigation is underway. He did not elaborate. Scroll down for video . Full confidence: Good Day New York co-anchor Rosanna Scotto, left, said today that she supports Greg Kelly . Accused: Greg Kelly, right, with his parents Ray - New York City Police Commissioner - and Veronica . His co-host Rosanna Scotto offered support for him, saying today: 'I love Greg. That’s all I can say.' The son of New York City's police commissioner has been accused of . sexually assaulting a woman who told authorities she got pregnant from . the encounter and had an abortion, people familiar with the . investigation said on Thursday. The Manhattan district attorney is . investigating the serious allegations, as an NYPD probe could be seen as . a conflict of interest. The alleged sexual assault took place in October, but the woman involved did not report her accusation until Tuesday. Kelly, a former Fox News correspondent, is cooperating with the investigation, his lawyer, Andrew Lankler, said in an emailed statement. Greg Kelly 'strenuously denies any wrongdoing of any kind,' Lankler . said. 'We know that the district attorney's investigation will prove Mr. Kelly's innocence.' The lawyer didn't respond to questions about the . focus of the investigation. Family: Father and son are both well-known figures in New York . A friend of the alleged victim’s . boyfriend told ABC News that the woman had been ‘an emotional cripple’ since the alleged incident. The . friend said her boyfriend was outraged over the alleged attack. ‘He . went and picked her up from the office where she was distraught, and he . said later that the rape had taken place there,’ the friend told ABC . News. The woman, who is around 30, told police that she and Mr Kelly met on the street and went for drinks at the South Street Seaport on the evening of October 8, according to the New York Times. They went to her office at a law firm in downtown Manhattan, where the assault allegedly happened. She says that when her boyfriend found out about the encounter, he confronted the older Mr Kelly at a public event, saying: 'Your son ruined my girlfriend's life,' according to NYPD spokesman Paul Browne. The commissioner told him to write a letter detailing the allegations, as he reportedly didn’t want to discuss it in public. His lawyer added: 'We know that the District Attorney's investigation will prove Mr. Kelly's innocence.’ Lower Manhattan: The two allegedly went to the South Street Seaport in New York's Financial District for drinks, sources say . Mr Kelly, 43, joined Fox News Channel in 2002 and was the White House correspondent from 2005-2007.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:03 AM on 28th January 2012 . For 18 years Linda Arnaud was forced to relocate through six states as a crazed stalker tracked her every move. Each time she moved her life and switched jobs, homes and even states the terrified yoga instructor prayed it would be her last relocation. And each and very time twisted stalker Moses Shepard would hunt her down. Safe at last: Linda Arnaud, 45, was stalked by Queens native Moses Shepard for 18 years . Shepard's reign of terror began after he enjoyed a stroll through Central Park with the former elementary school teacher. They knew each other through shared membership of a running club, but after the walk in the park the Upper East Side New Yorker decided she did not want to take the friendship any further. It was then that the trouble began as the then Queens resident wouldn't take no for an answer and began a spiralling hate campaign that would last almost half his victim's lifetime. Linda, now 45, said: 'He showed up at my place of work. He showed up at my school, at my apartment - he showed up on the subway platform. He stalked me all over New York City. 'I was terrified of him.' Shepard tormented her for six months before he found her living in Santa Fe, California and later in Hartford, Connecticut. Finally after almost 20 years of protracted and prolonged harrassment across the United States Moses has been found guilty of federal stalking charges. Linda, who was 27 when she agreed to the innocent stroll, said of their first meeting: 'It was fine. We just walked around Central Park, got to know each other. I just decided on that date that he didn’t interest me at all.' But Shepard - who claims to have 'an Ivy League education' - didn't get the message and began hounding his victim as she moved across statelines to escape him. Innocent stroll: Shepard would not take no for an answer after his victim decided not to pursue their friendship after a walk in Central Park in New York . The teacher-turned-fitness instructor spent two decades moving to New Mexico, Arizona, California and Connecticut after she abandoned New York. And as soon as Shepherd found her he would again bombard her with phone calls, emails, letters, CDs and porn. He would wait until restraining orders would run out and then restart his vile crusade renewing his fantasy of reuniting with her. His terrified victim even ensured that all official records for her showed that she lived with her parents in Tucson, Arizona. But nothing could stop him. It was when he tracked her down to yet another home in Connecticut in February 2010 with a chilling death threat that she feared he might kill her. She explained: 'He said he’s ‘coming for me.’ And that’s when I feared for my life. He came here; he scoped out my house; he scoped out my work. He’s never taken no for an answer.' Police then arrested Shepard at his Arizona home in May 2010 and alerted the FBI. He now faces five years behind bars following a federal trial. Linda added: 'I hope that justice is served and that there’s more awareness that stalking is a serious crime.' And she said: 'I was trying to get him to stop, and he won’t. But I’m also just a really positive, strong person, and I try to live my life as normally as I can.'","Lisa Arnaud moved from New York to California, New Mexico and Arizona to escape Moses Shepard .

"By . Rebecca Seales . Last updated at 2:00 AM on 29th January 2012 . Guilty: Music teacher Tracy Frankcom admitted telling police that she was the victim of three armed robberies - when in fact she had launched the knife attacks on herself . A piano teacher’s reputation lay in ruins yesterday after she was unmasked as a hoaxer who triggered a massive police manhunt by falsely claiming she was being stalked by a crazed 'psycho slasher'. Tracy Frankcom, 41, mutilated her own hands with a kitchen knife and slapped herself in the face - then wrongly alleged her injuries were caused by a sinister assailant who attacked her three times in 12 weeks at her music shop and farmhouse home. Frankcom also sent herself poison pen text messages and abusive Christmas cards reading: 'It’s your last b****' and 'You’re dead b****' and helped officers create an e-fit of the fictitious assailant. Frankcom’s husband Martin, also a . musician, was so worried about the terror campaign he went onto the . internet and bought his wife a stab-proof vest and a stun gun for . protection. Lancashire . Police staged a major operation to track down the stalker, gave Frankcom . police protection when she left work, and referred their inquiries onto . murder squad detectives. They even scrambled the force helicopter to . search for suspects. Police eventually arrested an innocent . man, held him for 18 hours and forced him to take part in an ID parade . before releasing him without charge. Officers finally became suspicious of . Frankcom’s account when inquiries drew a blank and she later confessed . she had made it up - claiming she was 'in a dark place' following a . minor bust up with a customer at her sheet music store in Darwen, . Lancashire. She claimed she was due to carry out a . fourth and fatal attack upon herself. The self-mutilation damaged the . tendons in Frankcom's left thumb, and may affect her piano playing for . the rest of her life. The bill for the police operation came to £10,000 in total. Frankcom broke down and wept at Preston Crown Court as she admitted three charges of perverting the course of justice. She was ordered to pay police £5,000 . pounds compensation for the wasted man-hours, and will have to pay £1,500 . prosecution costs. She was also ordered to complete a three year community order during which she will seek help for her problems. Poisonous: These images show the inside of the Christmas cards and sympathy cards Frankcom sent to herself, pretending they were hate mail from a would-be attacker . Sympathy cards: The 'poison pen' cards Frankcom sent herself were retained by the Crown Prosecution Service as evidence of her guilt . Judge Andrew Woolman told Frankcom: 'You are an educated woman, hardworking and a talented music teacher. 'There’s no explanation why a woman of . 41 years old should embark on such a series of lies and exaggerations . with serious consequences to you and everyone else. 'It is a bizarre case, one of the most . bizarre cases I’ve come across as a judge, and it does not fall into the . normal categories. Usually the case is that is made against a named . individual to false rape or the like and if a person lies like this they . go to prison. 'But I think there is some deep-seated problem in your character that caused you to behave like this. No good would come of imprisoning you and it might well be enough to stop you again given people will now know the lengths you went to.' Frankcom, who also teaches violin and guitar, spent years building up her music career. According to her website she was approached by Yamaha UK to act as a demonstrator for their keyboards, and she played alongside husband Martin in a Jean Michel Jarre tribute band called JarreLook. The pair later set up their own music school together. The court heard how the police investigation began in October 2010 when Frankcom claimed she was attacked outside her Arietta Music shop in Rossendale, Lancashire. She claimed she had been moving musical instruments into the shop when she was grabbed by the neck and 'slashed' with a knife during a scuffle with two men who tried to rob her. Mr Bob Sastry, prosecuting, said she had a 3cm wound on her forearm and was said to be 'visibly upset'. Complete fiction: Frankcom helped Lancashire Police compile an e-fit of her non-existent attacker, and appealed to the public for help in catching the 'psychopath' As well as handing in a blood-stained top and black headband to the police, she compiled an e-fit of one of her assailants and asked police to issue the picture and make a public appeal for information. The following month, Frankcom claimed she was by her vehicle in a car park when an Asian man stabbed and tried to rob her, saying, 'No f..king white bitch is going to humiliate me.' Mr Sastry said: 'She was taken in the ambulance to the hospital and photos were taken in relation to the injury. Two wounds were inflicted. The tendons on her left thumb were severed and a further operation was performed.' He added: 'The defendant had gone to Argos and bought a pay as you go mobile telephone, but police discovered that the phone had only been used to contact the defendant herself. 'She claimed she had silent phone calls and another Christmas card saying 'You’re dead b****'. Police fully investigated the complaints.' The following January Frankcom reported a third attack at her home, saying that while she was putting the bins out a man had put a rope around her neck and slashed her with a knife. She claimed she had shot him with the stun gun and that she was also wearing the stab vest she had purchased. She had bruises to the right side of her face and a three inch deep wound which required seven stitches at hospital. At the time of the attacks Frankcom, who has been teaching piano, keyboard, guitar and violin for 11 years, claimed she was afraid to be in the shop alone after dark and gave an interview to her local newspaper about her ordeal. Police later arrested an Asian man in Bolton in relation to the alleged offences, and he was on bail for three days before officers told him no further action would be taken. Frankcom was arrested in March last year after police began to suspect the robberies had not actually happened. Scene of the invented crime: The police investigation began in October 2010 when Frankcom claimed she had been attacked with a knife outside her Arietta Music shop in Darwen . Mr Sastry said: 'Because of the continued nature of the attacks police went down to try to safeguard the local area and the investigation cost police resources £10,000. 'Officers thought she had a potential stalker, and a considerable area of the community was affected. The allegations involved a racist element, police were very careful to investigate and it didn’t help race relations in the area. 'A police helicopter was sent out as well as dog patrols and the police had to ensure officers were present when she left work. Police had to refer the incident to the major incident team.' Frankcom initially denied any wrongdoing before breaking down and confessing to fabricating her ordeal. She also admitted illegal possession of the stun gun.

"51% of voters in poll want independence from U.K . By . Daniel Martin . Last updated at 11:45 PM on 29th January 2012 . Scotland would remain part of a United Kingdom even if it became independent, Alex Salmond declared yesterday. The SNP leader said the Queen would still be head of state of a politically independent Scotland, meaning it would stay in ‘monarchical union’ with England. Mr Salmond used the argument to claim it would be confusing if a referendum question asked whether Scotland should leave the United Kingdom – rather than asking if it should become independent. Some of the Queen's duties for Scotland include judicial matters and the appointment of judges by recommendation . The Scottish first minister made the remarks as a poll in the Scottish Sunday Express found that 51 per cent of voters north of the border want to break away. In an interview, Mr Salmond said: ‘I think that some of that increase in support for independence is a reaction against the sort of dictatorial line we’ve been getting from some of the pronouncements from Downing Street. ‘I think the Prime Minister would do well to perhaps listen to the voice of the people and try to conduct this debate with a bit more positivity.’ Alex Salmond insists the Queen would remain as Head of State . Last week, Mr Salmond argued that the referendum question should be: ‘Do you want Scotland to be an independent country?’ Critics say this tilts voters towards ‘yes’, and that the question should be more like: ‘Do you want Scotland to leave the United Kingdom?’ But in his interview, Mr Salmond argued that, in effect, the UK would remain intact even if Scotland goes its own way – so that form of question would not be valid. However, Labour MP for Glasgow  Central, Anas Sarwar, said on Twitter: ‘It  is utterly ridiculous for Salmond to  suggest that we would remain part of the United Kingdom if Scotland was to vote for separation.’ Labour peer Lord Foulkes described keeping ‘the Queen, the pound, the  Scots Guards and EastEnders’ as a ‘funny idea of independence’.",51% of voters in poll want independence from U.K .
"By . Michael O'farrell . Last updated at 2:35 AM on 29th January 2012 . A second former Fianna Fáil minister is under . investigation over allegations of mobile-phone expenses fraud, the Irish Mail . on Sunday can reveal. Fraud squad detectives are formally investigating a . series of allegedly bogus expense claims submitted by former TD and junior . minister Ned O’Keeffe. The investigation by officers at the Garda Bureau of . Fraud Investigation has been running in tandem with the separate probe into the . expense claims of Ivor Callely, the former TD, junior minister and senator. Inquiry: Senator Callely in Cork in 2010, after our exposé into his bogus expenses claims . Mr Callely was arrested and released without charge this . week and a file was sent to the DPP. The investigation was sparked by MoS . revelations in August 2010 that Mr Callely had claimed almost €3,000 in mobile . phone expenses using receipts that could not be genuine. The controversial former minister later accepted that the . receipts were bogus but insists he is innocent and that somebody else was . responsible for the fakes. If he is charged and convicted, he could face up to . 10 years in jail for obtaining money using a ‘false instrument’. Weeks after the Callely exposé, the MoS revealed that his . Fianna Fáil colleague Mr O’Keeffe had also claimed over €2,200 in mobile-phone . expenses using receipts that could not be genuine. However, while Senator Callely’s bogus claims were . immediately looked into by the Oireachtas authorities – who then passed the . matter on to gardaí and the DPP – Leinster House officials took no action . against Mr O’Keeffe. Despite being made aware of the evidence against Mr . O’Keeffe, the Oireachtas authorities – headed by Dáil Clerk Kieran Coughlan – . have never investigated. Mr Coughlan himself has repeatedly insisted that the . expenses were legitimate and that there was no question of a bogus invoice . being submitted or accepted. Mr Coughlan allowed Mr O’Keeffe to submit fresh paperwork . ‘correcting’ the information in one disputed invoice – and has ever since . insisted the claim was ‘properly made’. This stance seems to contradict the view taken by gardaí, . who appear to believe the former minister has questions to answer. Six months after our revelations, Mr O’Keeffe retired . when the general election was called in February 2011. However, a Garda investigation into Mr O’Keeffe’s . expenses was formally launched in September 2011 after our evidence was handed . over to GBFI detectives. The dossier includes three invoices that Mr O’Keeffe . submitted to claim €2,237.53 in expenses from the Oireachtas. The invoices were all on headed note paper apparently . from TR Motor Services Ltd – a respected Mercedes dealership in Harold’s Cross, . south Dublin. Mr O’Keeffe’s invoices were not questioned by the Dáil . authorities and he was paid the full amount on the invoices. But as soon as the MoS saw the three receipts, a number . of irregularities were immediately apparent. One issue was that the invoices appeared to have been . printed on standard headed paper. When the MoS obtained a genuine invoice from . TR Motor Services, it was markedly different to the amateurish versions . submitted by Mr O’Keeffe. The documents provided to the Oireachtas by Mr O’Keeffe . also had no invoice numbers: a TR Motors accounts employee insisted that all . the firm’s invoices carry such a number. In addition, just one of the invoices bore a VAT number – . another standard feature of any legitimate sales docket. Moreover, all of the invoices had charged VAT at the . incorrect rate of 13.5%. The Revenue confirmed to the MoS that the correct VAT . rate for installing mobile phone kits at the time was 21%. But possibly the most glaring aspect of the invoices was . the amount involved, which seemed impossibly high for the goods and services . listed. For example, one of the invoices bills €330 in labour . charges even though no labour is required to install the component listed. Crucially, the MoS also established that TR Motors’ own . accounts did not show the firm having received all of the payments claimed by . Mr O’Keeffe. Mr O’Keeffe has always insisted the invoices are genuine . and that he got them ‘free and fair’. Dáil expenses will now be kept secret . The Oireachtas has introduced a new expenses system under . which it will be almost impossible to root out bogus claims like Ivor . Callely’s. Until recently, . any claims for vouched expenses had to be backed up with a receipt which was . then retained by the Oireachtas. It was the . examination of such receipts which allowed the Irish Mail on Sunday to show . that Ivor Callely’s mobile phone claims were based on fake invoices – leading . directly to his arrest last week. Exposé: How the MoS broke the story of O’Keeffe’s claims, now being investigated by Gardaí . Now, however, the . rules have been changed so that TDs and Senators will not have to supply . receipts – even for supposedly ‘vouched’ expenses. They will simply . claim for amounts they say they have spent, with the Oireachtas trusting them . to give accurate figures. The only method of . policing the claims is a system of random audits, under which one in ten . politicians will be asked to provide the receipts to back up their claims. However, for 90% . of politicians, no receipts will ever have to be handed over – meaning that the . invoices cannot be checked to ensure they are genuine. TDs and Senators . will be obliged to hold on to the receipts for five years, but unless they are . audited, there is no means by which a member of the media or public can ever . get their hands on them – even by using Freedom of Information legislation. Expenses . campaigner and chartered accountant Enid O’Dowd said that even if invoices were . genuine, there could be abuses. ‘There are no . rules insisting on value for money, or that the work does not go to family or . friends for these expenses. ‘So legitimately, . a TD could give a newsletter printing contract at an inflated price to a party . supporter or cousin. Because we can’t get the invoices under FoI, we can’t . check for this, and the auditors won’t – it’s not within their remit.’ Ms O’Dowd warned . that the new policy was further erosion of our ability to check how politicians . are spending our money. She said: ‘Only a . minority of the expenses paid to our politicians can be subject to audit as . most payments are fixed allowances paid automatically with no necessity to ever . show that anything like the amount paid was actually incurred. ‘This audit . related to only 10% of the TDs and Senators who opted for the higher allowance . – why not look at those who opt to be paid the lower allowance of €15,000 per . annum. I call this the “no questions asked” allowance. ‘The fact that . something like half our politicians opt for the lower figure tells me that they . have very few legitimate parliamentary expenses and that the allowance is a . form of untaxed salary for them.’ The Irish Mail on . Sunday has obtained a copy of the first independent audit of these vouched . expenses. Prepared by Mazars, the audit raises a series of issues about the . Oireachtas expenses regime and its loose rules. It said there were . no firm rules on what could and could not be claimed by TDs and Senators in a . number of key areas. Amongst the items . purchased, which had to be signed off without clear guidelines, were: bank . interest and fees, the purchase of computer equipment, and ‘sundry items’ like . newspapers, biscuits, tea and coffee. The audit report . said: ‘During our audit we noted a number of expenditure claims which do not . appear to have official guidelines as to whether they are allowable or not.’ It said clarity . was necessary on the purchase of items such as laptops and printers, and . particularly whether they should be returned to the Oir-eachtas if the . politicians eventually lose their seat. A source in . Leinster House said: ‘The issue here is whether that politician then owns the . equipment even though they have used somebody else’s money to buy it.’ The report also . said there was an issue in relation to the funding of advertising by TDs and . Senators for party colleagues using public funds. According to . guidelines, adverts should simply state the most basic information about when . constituency clinics were being held. But in a number of . cases, it appears other information including slogans and joint advertisements . with party members were being paid for by the taxpayer. The report said: . ‘We consider that further clarity should be provided to members as to these . conditions which must be met and the criteria in order to be a qualifying . expense.’ It further noted problems with telephone bills: ‘The level of detail of evidence submitted . varied for this expenditure category… [it] should show the member’s telephone . numbers assigned for the relevant period for public representation purposes.’ Another problem . noted in the report was the hiring of meeting rooms. The Houses of the . Oireachtas had decided in March 2010 to create the two expenses options  – the lower ‘unvouched’ payment with no . audit, or a higher ‘vouched’ payment that could be subject to audit. A statement said: . ‘The core purpose of this audit was to establish whether members had valid . evidence of vouchers, receipts and bills in respect of the amount paid to them. ‘The Audit Report . also includes the auditors’ recommendations to provide further definition and . clarity.’ The Oireachtas defended . the new procedures, saying: ‘The audit of the public representation allowance . was conducted… [to facilitate] the first audit of expenses of a random sample . of members and preparation of the audit report for the Houses of the . Oireachtas. ‘Members who were in receipt of vouched allowance amounts . must retain the evidence of the expenses incurred, for inspection only, to an . auditor appointed by the Oireachtas Commission.’","As DPP mulls Callely file, fraud squad mounts inquiry into Ned O’Keeffe invoices .

Now the Drakelow Tunnels, a 265,000 square foot complex encompassing nuclear bunkers used in the Cold War, can be seen by a wider public audience after they were unveiled during a rare open day. The bunkers near Kidderminster, Worcestershire, were constructed during World War Two originally for use by Rover under the Ministry of Aircraft Production’s Shadow Factory Scheme. Eerie: The now empty tunnels were formerly occupied by MPs, military officials and the RAF until the Cold War ended in the early 1990s . Hideout: The tunnels were originally built for machine workshops in World War Two, but became strategy bunkers as tensions grew in the Cold War . War rooms: The kitchen of the canteen in the tunnels, which underwent a £1m renovation in the late 1980s . Code named MACADAM, the tunnels were originally built to Rover could use them to produce aero engines and components. Although mainly used for machine workshops and storage, the secretive facility was given a second lease of life during the Cold War when officials took it over fearing a nuclear attack. New rooms, equipment, water and other utilities were installed inside the tunnels as it became a base for the Regional Seat of Government. Working ladies toilets were another feature of the Cold War bunker shown to the 60 visitors during the Open Day . Water works: A hot water dispenser in the bunker still has the same shine it did several decades ago . Preserved: A Trust of local people in Worcestershire helped save the bunker from redevelopment after it was sold in 1993 . During the Cold War itself, MPs, army officials, the RAF and local police were among those who would use the underground complex to run exercises in case Britain was attacked. In the late 1980s the government extensively renovated the bunkers at a cost of around £1,000,000, but as the Cold War ended in the early 1990s the site was eventually sold off. Once the site was privately sold, plans emerged to turn it into a residential and commercial park. However, the facility was saved after residents formed the Drakelow Preservation Trust and helped fight its redevelopment.","Drakelow Tunnels were constructed in WW2 but became Cold War hideouts .

An American 'billionaire' who claims he wants to buy HMS Ark Royal for £375million is an alleged conman facing up to 20 years in jail. Mark D. Jones had set up a deal to buy the 600ft aircraft carrier and turn it into a floating hospital to be used on rescue missions at natural disasters. His scheme would have created hundreds of jobs and won the backing of officials in Belfast where the decommissioned carrier would have undergone a multi million pound re-fit. Uncertain future: First launched in 1981, HMS Ark Royal may be transformed into an international floating hospital . But far from being a billionaire Jones, 44, is currently in jail in upstate New York awaiting extradition to Las Vegas where he is wanted on fraud charges. He is wanted for swindling a woman out of more than £100,000 with an investment scheme to aid Native Americans. British-born Jones, who run as construction company called Stratezyme in Tennessee, has been on the run for over a year after failing to turn up for a court hearing in Las Vegas. Prosecutors in Las Vegas said Mark D Jones is conman who 'doesn't have a pot to pee in.' John Kelleher, chief deputy attorney for the fraud division of the Nevada state attorney's office, described him as a 'Walter Mitty' character. He said Jones had spent the money he allegedly stole on 'strippers and luxury hotels'. Jones is due in court in the town of Lockport, near Niagara Falls, for a hearing on his extradition to Las Vegas. The 22,000-ton Invincible Class carrier, launched in 1981, was controversially put up for sale online after it was axed by the Government in 2010’s defence review. Plans for it had included selling it for scrap, turning it into a nightclub or sinking it for use as a diving wreck. Jones's idea would have involved sailing the ship from its mooring in Portsmouth to Belfast where it would undergo a massive overhaul for use as a hospital. It would also be fitted with a desalination plant so it could be deployed in areas struck by water-borne diseases and transform seawater into safe drinking water. The vessel would also carry building machinery to assist reconstruction in disaster zones.",British-born Mark D. Jones wanted on fraud charges .

While Stephen Hester has been lambasted over £1million bonus, his sister has devoted  her life to helping the needy and trying to bring about a fairer society. Catherine Hester is the former head of Oxfam in Wales and played an active role in the Make Poverty History campaign. The 43-year-old also spent two years as a volunteer in Tanzania, where she co-ordinated an education programme for street children. Before that she worked with children with special needs and taught in a primary school in London’s East End. In her time with Oxfam she was passionate about trying to raise living standards for the worst off. She told a newspaper: ‘Make Poverty History is not about charity, it is about justice. It is about justice for the poorest people in the world. We need to keep the public pressure and public outrage going.’ A former colleague of Miss Hester’s at Oxfam, Katrina Gass, said: ‘She cared a lot. She was very dynamic and innovative. She was very interested in welfare of children but also interested in the environment.’ Oxfam has backed the campaign for a ‘Robin Hood tax’ which highlighted a massive earlier bonus handed to Mr Hester as part of its demand for higher contributions from the financial sector. Miss Hester declined to comment about her brother’s latest bonus when the Daily Mail contacted her at her modest detached house in Reading, Berkshire, yesterday. In the past Mr Hester has told how  his first job in a sweet factory  taught him the value of money and insisted that the life he now leads is a ‘long way from the world I grew up in.’ Fat cat: Stephen Hester has claimed humble beginnings, but he is in fact the child of high-flying academics .

"Pirates have moved American hostage three times in 24 hours after Wednesday's rescue . 'If they try again, we will all die . together,' a Somali pirate connected to the gang . holding the hostage . Rescued hostages are now at US. Naval Air Base in Sicily . By . Jill Reilly . Last updated at 2:30 PM on 27th January 2012 . Somali pirates have threatened to kill an American hostage after a daring night-time U.S Navy SEAL mission to rescue two foreign aid workers. The pirates have moved the hostage at least three times in 24 hours in reaction to the rescue of the U.S. woman and Danish man. Their response has now raised questions about whether other Western captives are now in greater danger. Danger: The pirates have moved the American hostage at least three times in 24 hours after U.S. Navy SEALs parachuted into Somalia to rescue a US woman and Danish man earlier in the week (graphic) Mission: Two teams of U.S. Navy SEALs rescued the hostages after a gun battle with the pirates in the middle of the night (file picture) 'If they try again, we will all die together,' warned Hassan Abdi, a Somali pirate connected to the gang holding the American, who was kidnapped on Saturday in northern Somalia. 'It's difficult to hold U.S. hostages, because it's a game of chance: die or get huge money. But we shall stick with our plans and will never release him until we get a ransom,' Abdi said. Overnight on Wednesday, U.S. Navy SEALs parachuted into Somalia and hiked to the base where the pirates were holding 32-year-old American Jessica Buchanan and Poul Hagen Thisted, a 60-year-old Dane. A gun battle ensued and nine of the pirates were killed. The hostages were freed unharmed. No casualties have been reported among the U.S. forces. In response the gang holding the American kidnapped in the northern town of . Galkayo have moved him three times, Abdi said. 'Holding hostages in one place is unlikely now because we are the next target,' he told The Associated Press by telephone. He also expressed concern that the U.S. has pirate informants. 'It . wasn't just a hit-and-run operation, but long planned with the help of . insiders among us,' Abdi said, noting that the Americans struck at a . time when the pirates were least on their guard. U.S. State Department spokesman Victoria Nuland said officials have . been in contact with the family of the latest American kidnapping . victim. Night-time rescue: The pirates kidnapped 32-year-old American Jessica Buchanan and Poul Hagen Thisted, a 60-year-old Dane in October . Held captive: Ms Buchanan, left, of Virginia, and Mr Thisted, right, are seen speaking in a hostage video . 'We are also working with our . contacts in Kenya and in Somalia to try to get more information,' Nuland . told reporters in Washington. 'Obviously . we condemn kidnapping of any kind and call for the immediate release of . the victims - any victims. We also would note that our travel warning . for Somalia does caution U.S. citizens about the risk of travel.' After their rescue, Miss Buchanan and Mr Thisted were flown to the U.S. Naval Air Base at Sigonella on the . Italian island of Sicily to undergo medical screenings and other . evaluations before heading home, a U.S. defense official said. Miss Buchanan's family was meeting her at the base, which is the hub of U.S. Navy air operations in the Mediterranean. The pair had been working for the . Danish De-mining Group, part of the Danish Refugee Council, when they . were abducted by gunmen near the north-central town of Galkay in . October. Danish Foreign Minister Villy Sovndal . said Miss Buchanan's poor health had led the U.S. to take action and . the operation did not necessarily pave the way for further missions . An ailing Frenchwoman kidnapped by Somali gunmen died in captivity last year after not having access to her medication. Message: Barack Obama, who authorised the rescue mission, called Miss Buchanan's father John to say: 'All Americans have Jessica in our thoughts and prayers, and give thanks that she will soon be reunited with her family' There is mixed opinion on the effect the U.S. raid will have on the situation with other . captives, with one pirate warning that other U.S. hostages might suffer as a . result. However a Western official in Kenya said that the killings of the nine captors might make pirates . think twice about taking more captives. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media. On Wednesday evening, hours after the U.S. military raid, the gang holding the American hostage started circulating false rumours that they had executed him. Another security official who has years of experience in the region said it was likely the men holding the American would move him onto a ship with other foreign hostages, because ships were easier to defend and planning rescue operations is more complicated when hostages from other countries are involved. At least one pirate agreed with his analysis. 'I think land captivity is going to end now. Sea is much safer,' pirate Mohamed Nur said by phone from the coastal town of Hobyo. 'Even ships are not very safe, but you can at least hit back and resist.' Other hostages held in Somalia include a British tourist and two Spanish aid workers seized in neighboring Kenya, a French military adviser and 155 sailors of various nationalities hijacked at sea.","Pirates have moved American hostage three times in 24 hours after Wednesday's rescue .

"By . Rob Waugh . Last updated at 6:19 PM on 23rd January 2012 . 'Behavioural pricing' would tailor pricing to individual users - with special offers targeted to certain shoppers, but also taking into account information from social networks such as Facebook or Twitter . Online shops already have a frightening amount of information at their fingertips - from whether you've purchased from them before, to what sites you've visited before you arrive at their shop, accessible via browsing history. But new start-ups could move the idea to a new level - harvesting information from sources such as Facebook and Twitter to 'tweak' prices to what customers are willing to pay. In other words, if you've 'Liked' something, prepare to pay for it. One web entrepreneur, Alex Gannett, founder of CampusSplash says that 2012 will be 'the year of . behavioural pricing' - a new type of e-commerce, where prices will be . tweaked to include what customers are willing to pay. Using such freely available information isn't an out-there idea. Demdex, acquired by Adobe last year, has built a business on harvesting user information from 'cookies' - invisible internet files -  to build up a picture of what audiences like so that advertisers can target people more effectively. Tweaking prices to suit the individual could be the next step. The idea has already started raising privacy alarm bells. Gannet writes, 'This year will mark the end of static pricing. The use of your tweets, credit score, and web history in e-commerce pricing is frightening—but ultimately unavoidable.' Gannett describes the idea as a 'consumer's worst nightmare, a merchant's dream'. Chris Simpson, Chief Marketing Officer at price comparison website Kelkoo says, 'There are many pricing policies already used by retailers that most consumers are completely unaware of.' 'These include things like regional pricing variations in the same stores across the country, not to mention retailers using different pricing structures for the same products in stores and online.' Shops already harvest information from loyalty card programmes, and also use credit ratings to decide what rates some customers should pay for products such as loans. Gannett writes, 'Online marketers have . dramatically increased the amount of behavioral data they have on . consumers. It comes from a complex network of web histories, . demographic records, loyalty programs, and increasingly, social media . profiles. In the last few years, behavioral data has matured and gained . widespread acceptance and usage in online advertising. Startups like . Demdex  allow advertisers to access “databanks” of . behavioral information on users, and target advertising to them.' Kelkoo's Simpson says that although the idea seems like a next step for businesses, it may be hard to work in the real world - particularly when web shoppers are fond of using apps and comparison sites to track down the best bargains. Simpson says, 'Whilst behavioural pricing might seem like the next logical step, it is a hugely complex initiative for retailers to implement.' 'The danger of this pricing strategy is that if ‘social savvy’ shoppers became aware of it, it could lead to a social media boycott destroying a retailer’s reputation very quickly.' The great thing about price comparison sites like Kelkoo is that we offer customers price transparency. In essence, customer data does not influence the prices that are displayed on our website.'","'2012 will be the year of behavioural pricing' - entrepreneur .

"By . Rob Waugh . Last updated at 9:50 AM on 24th January 2012 . Nasa's Cassini probe has found that the dunes on the surface of Saturn's moon Titan vary in shape just like dunes on Earth - and even look similar to deserts on our planet. The similarities end there, of course - not only are the dunes on Titan 300 feet high and up to a mile wide, they're made of frozen hydrocarbons - chemicals found in crude oil - rather than sand. There are four million square miles of dunes on Titan, an area the size of the United States. Their formations could be key to understanding the clouded moon's mysterious weather patterns. The huge dunes of frozen hydrocarbons on the surface of Saturn's moon Titan were captured by Nasa's Cassini probe - and the geographical variations on Titan are similar to variations on Earth . Analysis of images sent back by Nasa's orbiting Cassini probe found that the dunes form patterns similar to deserts on Earth. The result gives new clues about the moon’s climatic and geological history.Dune fields are the second most dominant landform on Titan, after the seemingly uniform plains, so they offer a large-scale insight into the moon’s peculiar environment. Though similar in shape to the linear dunes found on Earth in Namibia or the Arabian Peninsula, Titan’s dunes are gigantic by our standards. They are on average 0.6 to 1.2 mileswide, hundreds of miles long and around 300 feet (100 meters) high. However, their size and spacing vary across the surface, betraying the environment in which they have formed and evolved. Artist's conception of the dunes on Saturn's moon: The dunes are up to 300 feet high and a mile wide, and made of frozen hydrocarbons - the chemicals found in crude oil - not sand . Using radar data from the Cassini spacecraft, Alice Le Gall, a former postdoctoral fellow at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, and collaborators have discovered that the size of Titan’s dunes is controlled by at least two factors: altitude and latitude. More elevated dunes tend to be thinner and more widely separated. The gaps between the dunes seem to appear to Cassini’s radar, indicating a thinner covering of sand. The sand needed to build the dunes seems to be mostly found in the lowlands of Titan.Scientists think the sand on Titan is not made of silicates as on Earth, but of solid hydrocarbons, precipitated out of the atmosphere. These have then fiormed  into grains 0.04 inch in size by a still unknown process.In terms of latitude, the sand dunes on Titan are confined to its equatorial region, in a band between 30 degrees south latitude and 30 degrees north latitude. However, the dunes tend to be less voluminous toward the north. Le Gall and colleagues think that this may be due to Saturn’s elliptical orbit. Each season on Titan lasts for about seven years. The slightly elliptical nature of Saturn’s orbit means that the southern hemisphere of Titan has shorter but more intense summers. So the southern regions are probably drier, which implies they have less ground moisture. The drier the sand grains, the more easily they can be transported by the winds to make dunes. 'As one goes to the north, we believe the soil moisture probably increases, making the sand particles less mobile and, as a consequence, the development of dunes more difficult,' says Le Gall.Backing this hypothesis is the fact that Titan’s lakes and seas are not distributed symmetrically by latitude. These reserves of liquid ethane and methane are predominantly found in the northern hemisphere, suggesting again that the soil is moister toward the north and so, again, the sand grains are less easy to transport by the wind.'Understanding how the dunes form as well as explaining their shape, size and distribution on Titan’s surface is of great importance to understanding Titan’s climate and geology,' says Nicolas Altobelli, ESA’s Cassini-Huygens project scientist.","Different areas of icy moon have different .

A Maoist revolutionary, he ends up a terrorist for the murderous Peruvian guerrilla group, Shining Path. The group's motto was 'Marxism – Leninism will open the shining path to revolution'. Nicholas Shakespeare, 54, who is a direct descendant of William's grandfather, said: 'I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the French presidential candidate had quoted me.' But he added: 'I was really pleased to see how the quote remains fresh. 'It can apply to anything and I think it's rather good it's applying to a presidential campaign. You don't need to be Marxist to want a better society.' Mistake: In fact, Francois Hollande was quoting current British author Nicholas Shakespeare (left) from his novel The Vision of Elena Silves (right) Of his character's quote, he told the Telegraph: 'He is saying the last Marxist revolution of the Sixties had failed. 'But his is going to succeed and the idea is that they failed because they did not have a dream.' The book has been translated into more than 10 languages, and won critical acclaim when it was released in France in 1991 with the publisher Albin Michel. President: Nicolas Sarkozy is lagging in the polls . Hollande has been ridiculed for his faux pas in Le Bourget outside Paris on Sunday. The right-wing UMP camp, which is backing the embattled Nicolas Sarkozy, is expected to seize on it as a sign he is not the 'reconstructed' left-winged as he likes to be portrayed. The rest of the rally, where he said he would raise taxes on banks, big firms and the rich to wipe out the public deficit,  has been hailed a success by the left. He also said he would pump more funds into education and state-aided job creation if he wins power in May. Hollande, tipped in polls to unseat Sarkozy and become France's first Socialist president in 17 years, promised to spend 20 billion euros on hiring 60,000 extra schooling staff and police, to help start-ups and small companies and create 150,000 state-aided jobs. He also vowed to lean hardest on the country's wealthiest as well as its biggest companies and the banking industry to drum up the lion's share of another 29 billion euros needed to cut the national deficit to zero by the end of 2017. The 57-year-old said: 'The vast majority of the French people will not be called on to make additional sacrifices. 'If there are sacrifices to be made, and there will be, then it will be for the wealthiest to make them.' He pledged to reduce France's large deficit to zero by the end of 2017, a year later than Sarkozy's conservative government, with 17 of the 29 billion euros needed coming from company tax and the rest from households, primarily the richest ones.","Francois Hollande thought he was citing The Bard .

At Apple's New York education event, the technology giant has unveiled a new do-it-yourself iBooks Author app which lets anyone create rich, visual books. The books can have galleries of pictures, video, interactive images and 3D images dropped directly into the text. The new app is free and works with computers running Apple's Mac OS X. The books will work on iBooks software on iPad. Users can import text directly from other applications such as Microsoft Word, and also add elements using web programming language such as HTML. The software automatically breaks up text and formats it as a book. There is even an option to add a glossary. 'Traditionally creating books is really hard, but we think we’ve changed all that with iBooks Author,' said Roger Rosner, Apple’s VP of Productivity Applications. The new app is freely available.

As the Pentagon prepares its major budget announcement today, the U.S. Army boss says he's comfortable with plans to shrink the size of his force and shift the military's focus to Asia, saying troops there will remain relevant and capable. Gen Raymond Odierno declined to disclose figures the Pentagon is due to unveil that envision a smaller Army and the withdrawal of two brigade combat teams from Europe. Those fixed brigades will be replaced by rotational units. Cuts: The Pentagon plans to slash the size of his force and shift the military's focus to Asia under a new budget proposal . 'We're now out of Iraq, we're reducing our commitment in Afghanistan, so we can now bring the size of the Army down. And I feel comfortable with how we're going to do that,' Gen Odierno said in an interview from his Pentagon office. 'It's more about the timeline we bring it down on, and I'm satisfied with that timeline.' The Pentagon will preview President Barack Obama's budget proposal for the Pentagon on Thursday. It is expected to cut $260billion in projected defence spending over the next five years and favour services like the Navy and the Air Force over the Army and Marines. At ease: Gen Odierno says he's 'comfortable' with how the Department of Defense plans to reduce the size of the army as part of $260billion in cuts . A U.S. official confirmed media reports that the Pentagon plans to slash eight Army brigades and reduce the overall force to as few as 490,000 over the next decade from around 565,000. But President Obama and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta have said they will not hollow-out the force with the kind of cuts the military endured in the wake of the Vietnam War. Prominent in the plan is a renewed focus on Asia, where China's rapid military modernization has raised worry in Washington and rattled U.S. allies. That, along with continued security threats in the Middle East - especially Iran - is why Panetta wants to invest more in certain air and naval assets. He also is putting a focus on cybersecurity and commando forces like those who killed Osama bin Laden last May and who swooped into Somalia on Tuesday to rescue two hostages, including an American. The Pentagon has embraced a proposal by special operations chief Adm Bill McRaven to send more manpower and equipment to worldwide 'Theater Special Operations Commands' to strike back wherever threats arise, according to a senior defence official who spoke to the AP, and other current and former U.S. officials briefed on the program. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the details of the proposal are still being worked out, including how fast the changes could be made. U.S. officials have pointed to concerns about China's military build-up and North Korea's nuclear advances as they explain plans to focus more on the Asia-Pacific region. Gen Odierno, fresh from a trip to Asia, acknowledged the need for naval and air assets in any military strategy for the Pacific. Heritage Foundation table . Plan: Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has said the Defense Department and the White House will not hollow-out the U.S. Army with the kind of cuts the military endured in the wake of the Vietnam War . But he stressed that the Army will keep playing an important role in the region, and pointed to the 19,160 soldiers deployed in South Korea as a deterrent against the North. Gen Odierno saw no downsizing of the Army presence in Asia and said it will further supplement its forces with troops who rotate in and out of the region. He said: 'That's what we got to decide: How much rotational presence will we be able to do'. Should the U.S. Army be reduced in size to help the economy? Gen Odierno noted that the Army could play an important diplomatic role engaging with militaries in Asia, given that 22 out of the 28 chiefs of defence in the Pacific are army officers. Seven out of the world's 10 largest land armies in the world are in the Pacific, he added. That common army background 'will help us to build relationships,' he said. But . several Republicans argue that even the initial cuts totaling nearly . $490billion would 'hollow' the military and costs tens of thousands of . jobs nationwide, adding to an 8.5 per cent unemployment rate that they . already blame on the president's economic policies. 'While Secretary Panetta has conceded . that our nation is now accepting more risk as a result of the budgetary . vise squeezing the Pentagon, it remains unclear exactly what risks our . nation is assuming,' Rep Randy Forbes, R-Va., a House Armed Services . Committee member, said this week. Odierno, . who in the past commanded U.S. forces in Iraq, has put together . Marching Orders, a pamphlet explaining his vision for the future of the . Army that he intends to start distributing next week. In it, he says his intent is to maintain 'the most decisive land force in the world.' Gen Odierno said: 'We're going to be an Army in transition. We'll be in transition for the next five or six years'. 'But . as we come out of this transition, we're going to take the lessons . we've learned over the last seven or eight years,' he said, adding the . future Army would be more versatile and flexible. 'The . president, the secretary [of defence] have been very clear, that they . need a strong, capable Army. We will continue to have a strong, capable . Army,' he said.

Nintendo's new Wii U console will be in shops by 2012 - the console is said to be twice as powerful as Xbox 360, and has a tablet-style controller which works as a secondary screen. Full details will be revealed in May . Nintendo's new Wii U console will be in shops in Europe, Japan and America by the end of 2012, the company announced today. The move came after the Japanese game giant revealed a sharp drop in quarterly profit, as its consoles battled with devices such as Apple's iPhone. The arrival of big-name franchises such as Super Mario 3D Land on the company's glasses-free 3DS console failed to lift figures for the last quarter. Nintendo cut its forecast for annual . sales of its ageing Wii console to 10 million devices from 12 million, . and for the 3DS handheld games device to 14 million from 16 million. The new Wii U console is said to be twice as . powerful as Xbox 360, according to the latest rumours, and features a . tablet-style controller with a built-in screen. Details will be revealed . in May. The creator of the Super Mario franchise dominated the video games industry for years with its DS handheld and Wii home consoles, but is now struggling to keep up as more versatile smartphone and tablet sales boom. 'To say that (the days of consoles) are over is likely an overstatement, but social network and Internet delivered games are growing, which is a strong wind against Nintendo,' said Shigeo Sugawara, senior investment manager at Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Asset Management. Nintendo's Wii U console builds on the motion-controls of its predecessor, but adds a secondary controller with a screen . Nintendo's big franchises such as The Legend of Zelda remain exclusive to its consoles - but analysts now question whether their business model can survive in the age of iPhone . Nintendo now expects an annual operating loss of 45 billion yen ($575 million), dwarfing expectations of a 4.2 billion yen loss, based on the average of 21 analyst forecasts. 'We had higher expectations for the year-end season, but failed to meet them,' President Satoru Iwata told reporters in Osaka.        Poor sales forced Nintendo to slash the price of its much-anticipated 3DS handheld games device in August, just six months after its launch. The move halted its record of making profits on games hardware as well as software, a business model that took operating income to a high of 555 billion yen in 2008/09.    The company plans to launch the Wii's successor, the Wii U, in Japan, the United States, Europe and Australia in the year-end season, Iwata told reporters. But with cloud-based gaming emerging as a potential threat, Nintendo may have trouble generating excitement about its new product, some analysts say. Google is taking steps into gaming with Google TV, while Apple is thought to be preparing a new iPad and possibly a smart TV that could be game-changers for the industry. 'We think we need to consider the possibility that home consoles could become a thing of the past,' Citigroup analyst Soichiro Fukuda wrote in a recent report.","New console 'twice as powerful as Xbox 360' - reports .

"By . Wil Longbottom . Last updated at 7:28 AM on 27th January 2012 . Defiant: Iran has hinted it could reopen talks with the West, but President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad insists it will not give up its nuclear ambitions . Iran has indicated it is ready to revive talks with the West as Tehran cedes ground in the face of toughened sanctions. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has insisted international pressure will not force Iran to give up its demands, including the continuing enrichment of uranium, which forced the collapse of dialogue last year. But a senior UN nuclear agency team is expected to visit Tehran on Saturday - the first since a report in November that alleged Iran was on the brink of developing a nuclear weapon. The U.S. and European allies want Iran to stop making nuclear fuel, which they worry could lead to weapons-grade material and the production of nuclear weapons. Iran has always claimed its programme is for peaceful purposes - generating electricity and producing medical radioisotopes to treat cancer patients. The 27-member EU imposed an oil embargo on Iran on Monday, part of sanctions aimed at squeezing Tehran into resuming talks on the nuclear programme. It follows U.S. action aimed at limiting the country's ability to sell oil, which accounts for 80 per cent of Iran's foreign revenue. Suspicions: Technicians work at the reactor building at Bushehr nuclear power plant, 750 miles south of Tehran. Iran has always insisted its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes . Secretive: Mr Ahmadinejad at the Natanz nuclear plant in 2007. A report by the International Atomic Energy Agency last year indicated Iran was developing nuclear weapons . No date has been set for a possible resumption between Iran and the five permanent UN Security Council members, as well as Germany. Negotiations ended in stalemate in January last year, and Iran later rejected a plan to send its stockpile of low-enriched uranium abroad in exchange for reactor-ready fuel rods. Mr Ahmadinejad has accused the West of trying to scuttle the negotiations. He said: 'It is you who come up with excuses each time and issue resolutions on the verge of talks so that negotiations collapse. 'Why should we shun talks? Why and how should a party that has logic and is right shun talks? 'It is evident that those who resort to coercion are opposed to talks and always bring pretexts and blame us instead.' Security: A satellite image of Lavizan Shiyan - a restricted area in Tehran - which was completely dismantled after it was suspected of harbouring missile equipment . A delegation from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will be led by Deputy Director General Herman Nackaerts, who is in charge of the Iran nuclear file. Iran began uranium enrichment at a new underground site built to withstand possible airstrikes earlier this month, in another show of defiance against Western pressure to rein in its nuclear programme. Centrifuges at the bunker-like Fordo facility near Iran's holy city of Qom are churning out uranium enriched to 20 per cent. That level is higher than the 3.5 per cent being made at Iran's main enrichment plant at Natanz, central Iran, and can be turned into warhead material faster and with less work. Iran says it won't give up its right to enrich uranium and produce nuclear fuel, but it has offered to allow the IAEA inspectors to visit its nuclear sites to ensure that its programme won't be weaponised. The nuclear programme has been the target of covert Western operations, believed to have been carried out by Israel's Mossad. Four nuclear scientists have been killed in the last two years there, and there have also been mysterious explosions at nuclear facilities. Mr Ahmadinejad also said sanctions and oil embargo will backfire because it has minimum trade with EU. 'Americans have not purchased Iranian oil for 30 years. Our central bank has had no dealings with them ... our (total) foreign trade is about $200 billion. 'Between $23billion to $24billion of our trade is with Europeans, making up about 10 per cent of our total trade ... Iran won't suffer,' he said. The EU had been importing about 450,000 barrels of oil a day from Iran, making up 18 per cent of Iran's oil exports.","Talks broke down in January 2011 over refusal to stop uranium enrichment .

It is believe that the breakthrough could help scientists better understand how the degenerative condition affects the the nervous system, prompting more effective treatment. Alzheimer's is characterised by loss of neurons and synapses, leading to gradual memory loss and difficulties with language and emotions. Brain cells damaged by Alzheimer's have been created for the first time . And until now investigations have been limited to 'non-neuronal human cells' or 'animal models'. However a team from the University of California have developed a way of growing human cells. Currently there is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease, but medication is available that can slow down its development. During the research skin cells from two patients with a rare inherited form of Alzheimer's were taken and used to create neurons displaying biochemical hallmarks of the disease. Lead researcher Professor Lawrence Goldstein, said: 'Creating highly purified and . functional human Alzheimer's neurons in a dish - this has never been . done before. 'It's a first step. These aren't perfect models. They're proof of concept. But now we know how to make them. 'It requires extraordinary care and . diligence, really rigorous quality controls to induce consistent . behaviour, but we can do it.' Prof Goldstein highlighted in the paper, published in the journal Nature, that differences between a healthy neuron and an Alzheimer's neuron are subtle. But being able to grow Alzheimer's neurons will help scientists to better understand how the nervous system is impacted and which drugs would be most effective. He added: 'We need to do everything we can because the cost of this disease is just too heavy and horrible to contemplate. 'Without solutions, it will bankrupt us - emotionally and financially.' Further research is now underway. He said: 'We're dealing with the human brain. You can't just do a biopsy on living patients. 'Instead, researchers have had to work around, mimicking some aspects of the disease in . Neither approach is really satisfactory.' Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, which is a group of symptoms associated with a decline in mental abilities, such as memory and reasoning and is most common in people aged over 65. It attacks nerves, brain cells and neurotransmitters (chemicals that carry messages to and from the brain). Dementia affects around 570,000 people in England, with Alzheimer’s disease responsible for around 60 per cent of all cases.","Cells damaged by Alzheimer's created for first time .

Conservative MP John Whittingdale said the CNN star and former Daily Mirror editor could be quizzed by police, as others said Morgan could 'add more light' to the phone hacking investigation. Mr Morgan has been accused of bragging about listening to personal voicemails by Heather Mills who claimed her phone had been hacked by journalists from the paper. Hack claims: Heather Mills, right, accused Piers Morgan, left, of bragging about listening in to voicemail messages left for her by ex-husband Sir Paul McCartney . Mills claimed that a senior Mirror Group journalist admitted hacking voicemails left for her by Sir Paul McCartney. But Mr Whittingdale said Mr Morgan . would not immediately be called in front of the Commons Culture, Media . and Sport Committee, which is investigating phone hacking, because the . police inquiry  'has to be the priority '. Sir Paul McCartney's former wife told BBC2's Newsnight that the journalist made the admission in 2001. The BBC, which declined to name the . journalist allegedly involved, said it was not Mr Morgan, who was editor . of the Daily Mirror at the time. Mr Morgan issued a statement describing Ms Mills' claims as  'unsubstantiated '.

'I think it would help everybody, . including himself and this investigation, if he was able to say more . about why he wrote what he did in 2006. ' Mr Whittingdale told the BBC News . channel:  'What Therese Coffey has said is absolutely right - I would . like to see Mr Morgan come back to this country and answer what are some . very serious questions. ' He said the committee did not have the power to compel people to return to the UK to face questions. 'Now he may return to the UK, I hope . he will return to the UK and I imagine that there will be some questions . which will be put to him, possibly by the police on the basis of the . evidence that has emerged, ' he said. 'But at the moment, we can't do that. I'm sure the committee will want to talk about it when we meet but . Parliament is in recess at the moment, the police investigation is . ongoing. 'And the police investigation has to be the priority. ' In 2006, Morgan wrote an article, . published in the Daily Mail, saying: 'At one stage I was played a tape . of a message Paul had left for Heather on her mobile phone. It was . heartbreaking.' 'The couple had clearly had a tiff, Heather had fled to India, and Paul was pleading with her to come back. 'He sounded lonely, miserable and desperate, and even sang  'We Can Work It Out ' into the answerphone.' Tory MP Therese Coffey, left, and Labour . deputy leader Harriet Harman, right, have called on Morgan to answer . questions on the phone hacking scandal . Miss Mills told Newsnight: ‘There was . absolutely no honest way that Piers Morgan could have obtained that . tape that he has so proudly bragged about unless they had gone into my . voice messages.’ Trinity Mirror, publisher of the Mirror, said all its journalists work within the law.

'And it is why we insisted on a full . police investigation and the judicial inquiry having the powers and . broad remit to get to the bottom of illegal practices in our media.' Last night Morgan said: 'I have no . knowledge of any conversation any executive from other newspapers at . Trinity Mirror may or may not have had with Heather Mills.'
